5|$|The {{most stable}} and dense form of {{selenium}} is gray {{and has a}} hexagonal crystal lattice consisting of helical polymeric chains, where the Se-Se distance is 237.3pm and Se-Se-Se angle is 130.1°. The minimum distance between chains is 343.6pm. Gray Se is formed by mild heating of other allotropes, by <b>slow</b> <b>cooling</b> of molten Se, or by condensing Se vapor just below the melting point. Whereas other Se forms are insulators, gray Se is a semiconductor showing appreciable photoconductivity. Unlike the other allotropes, it is insoluble in CS2. It resists oxidation by air and is not attacked by nonoxidizing acids. With strong reducing agents, it forms polyselenides. Selenium does not exhibit the changes in viscosity that sulfur undergoes when gradually heated.|$|E
5|$|The {{most stable}} oxide of {{samarium}} is the sesquioxide Sm2O3. As many other samarium compounds, {{it exists in}} several crystalline phases. The trigonal form is obtained by <b>slow</b> <b>cooling</b> from the melt. The melting point of Sm2O3 is rather high (2345°C) and therefore melting is usually achieved not by direct heating, but with induction heating, through a radio-frequency coil. The Sm2O3 crystals of monoclinic symmetry can be grown by the flame fusion method (Verneuil process) from the Sm2O3 powder, that yields cylindrical boules up to several centimeters long and about one centimeter in diameter. The boules are transparent when pure and defect-free and are orange otherwise. Heating the metastable trigonal Sm2O3 to 1900°C converts it to the more stable monoclinic phase. Cubic Sm2O3 has also been described.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 Jeffrey Moore (planetary {{geologist}} of Ames Research Center) {{proposed an}} alternate view of Titan's geology. Noting that no volcanic features had been unambiguously identified on Titan so far, {{he asserted that}} Titan is a geologically dead world, whose surface is shaped only by impact cratering, fluvial and eolian erosion, mass wasting and other exogenic processes. According to this hypothesis, methane is not emitted by volcanoes but slowly diffuses out of Titan's cold and stiff interior. Ganesa Macula may be an eroded impact crater with a dark dune in the center. The mountainous ridges observed in some regions can be explained as heavily degraded scarps of large multi-ring impact structures or {{as a result of}} the global contraction due to the <b>slow</b> <b>cooling</b> of the interior. Even in this case, Titan may still have an internal ocean made of the eutectic water–ammonia mixture with a temperature of , which is low enough to be explained by the decay of radioactive elements in the core. The bright Xanadu terrain may be a degraded heavily cratered terrain similar to that observed on the surface of Callisto. Indeed, were it not for its lack of an atmosphere, Callisto could serve as a model for Titan's geology in this scenario. Jeffrey Moore even called Titan Callisto with weather.|$|E

It {{consists of a}} basement of tuff, underneath colonnades of a black fine-grained Tertiary basalt, overlying which is a third layer of basaltic lava without a crystalline structure. By contrast, <b>slow</b> <b>cooling</b> of the second layer of basalt resulted in an extraordinary pattern of predominantly hexagonal columns which form the faces and walls of the principal caves. The lava contracted towards each {{of a series of}} equally spaced centres as it cooled and solidified into prismatic columns, a process known as columnar jointing. The columns typically have three to eight sides, six being most common. The columns are also divided horizontally by cross joints. These columnar jointed sections represent the tops and bottoms of individual lava flows. Between these sections lie regions of much more chaotic jointing, known as the entablature. The origin of the entablature is unknown, but could be due to flooding of the lava flow, causing much more rapid cooling, or the interaction of stress fields from the two regions of columnar jointing as they approach one another.|$|E
5|$|Steel {{made from}} cast iron through oxygenation: The {{earliest}} known production of steel {{is a piece}} of ironware excavated from an archaeological site in Anatolia (Kaman-Kalehoyuk) and is about 4,000 years old. Other ancient steel comes from East Africa, dating back to 1400 BC. In the 4th century BC steel weapons like the Falcata were produced in the Iberian Peninsula, while Noric steel was used by the Roman military. The Chinese, who had been producing cast iron from the late Spring and Autumn period (722–481 BC), produced steel by the 2nd century BC through a process of decarburization, i.e. using bellows to pump large amounts of oxygen on to molten cast iron. This was first described in the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) book Huainanzi, compiled by scholars under Prince Liu An (179–122 BC). For steel, they used both quenching (i.e. rapid cooling) and tempering (i.e. <b>slow</b> <b>cooling)</b> methods of heat treatment. Much later, the American inventor William Kelly (1811–1888) brought four Chinese metallurgists to Eddyville, Kentucky in 1845, whose expertise in steelmaking influenced his ideas about air injection to reduce carbon content of iron; his invention anticipated the Bessemer process of English inventor Henry Bessemer (1813–1898).|$|E

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model {{was developed to}} quantitatively analyze the rheological data of rennet casein gels cooled at different rates, and the kinetic parameters were estimated and correlated with the microstructure development of the protein network. The kinetic model identified structure development to be first order, displaying multiple steps during cooling. By distinguishing the data into two regions with respect to gelation, the activation energies for these two regimes were estimated for four protein concentrations. At <b>slower</b> <b>cooling</b> rates and higher concentrations prior to gelation, the activation energies were higher, corresponding with {{a greater number of}} particle collisions prior to floc formation. This trend was reversed after gelation: a lower activation energy was observed for <b>slower</b> <b>cooling</b> rates and higher concentrations. This observation resulted from a higher order of flocs at a <b>slower</b> <b>cooling</b> rate and more flocs at a higher concentration, simplifying floc cross-linking. ...|$|R

Even though some layered peridotites appear to have no {{associated}} gabbro, they probably once were part of such a complex. Three main textures are found in peridotites: the first are well formed crystals of olivine surrounded by other minerals. These olivine crystals probably settled out of the magma first. Another texture is equal sized crystals with straight grain boundaries intersecting at 120°. This may result when <b>slow</b> <b>cooling</b> allowed recrystallization to minimize surface energy. A third texture has long crystals with ragged curvilinear boundaries, a result of internal deformation.|$|E
40|$|Quench sensitivity, the {{dependence}} of strength and hardness on the cooling rate after extrusion or solution treatment, limits the applications of extrusions of heat treatable aluminium alloys. Reduced properties in <b>slow</b> <b>cooled</b> samples have long been attributed {{to the loss of}} solute on heterogeneous nucleation sites during cooling. While minimum cooling rates to avoid precipitation of Mg-Si-containing phases and reduced properties have been mapped out for a broad range of commercial alloys, little is understood about the physical mechanisms leading to quench sensitivity. In this investigation the difference in hardness evolution between <b>slow</b> <b>cooled</b> and fast quenched samples of various commercial and model Al-Mg-Si alloys has been determined for a broad range of natural and artificial ageing times. This has demonstrated that the artificial ageing response of fast quenched samples differs greatly from the artificial ageing response of <b>slow</b> <b>cooled</b> samples. In contrast to fast cooled samples, where natural ageing has a negative effect, the artificial ageing response of <b>slow</b> <b>cooled</b> samples is less dependent on natural ageing time. As a result, hardness differences between fast and <b>slow</b> <b>cooled</b> samples is large during artificial ageing after short natural ageing times, but small after long natural ageing times, such that quench sensitivity strongly varies. In order to explain this phenomenon, the cooling rate dependent microstructural development has been investigated using hardness measurements, electron microscopy (SEM and TEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS). From TEM investigations and theoretical considerations of the diffusion range it has been determined that solute is only lost from a limited region around the non-hardening precipitates forming during cooling on secondary dispersoids. The increased age hardening rate in fast cooled samples after short natural ageing times is therefore the result of a high vacancy supersaturation rather than a high solute supersaturation compared to <b>slow</b> <b>cooled</b> samples. Non-equilibrium vacancies appear to act as precipitation sites for the precursor of the strengthening β”-precipitates. In <b>slow</b> <b>cooled</b> samples the formation of β”-precipitates seems to be suppressed. In lean alloys with a low solute content, such as the investigated AA 6060, the age hardening response is almost independent of the cooling rate. Small additions of Cu or changes in the Mg:Si-ratio in alloys with a combined Mg+Si-content greater than 1 wt. % have little effect on precipitation of non-hardening phases during cooling, but affect natural and artificial ageing behaviour. The cooling rate after extrusion or solution treatment was also found to affect whether natural ageing has a negative effect or not. In fast cooled samples of Al-Mg-Si alloys with combined Mg+Si-contents greater than 1 wt. % the decrease in ageing kinetics due to the decrease of non-equilibrium vacancies with increasing natural ageing time contributes to the negative effect. In <b>slow</b> <b>cooled</b> samples the initial number of quenched-in vacancies is low, such that ageing kinetics are independent of the natural ageing time...|$|R

25|$|The Chief {{is part of}} a {{medium-sized}} pluton of a granitic rock (granodiorite) that was initially formed in the early Cretaceous (approximately 100 million years ago) by the <b>slow</b> <b>cooling</b> and solidification of molten magma deep {{below the surface of the}} Earth. Exhumation of the granite body probably occurred mostly by erosion of overlying rocks over tens of millions of years, with glacial erosion processes dominating exhumation over the last 2.5 million years. Once exposed at the surface, the original granite body was shaped by glacial erosion, which is responsible for the tall steep walls that define the Chief, as well as the excavation of Howe Sound, a fjord. Classic hallmarks of glacial erosion are ubiquitous, especially polished, striated surfaces. Polish and striations observable at the very summit of the formation require that, at the peak of glaciation, the entire formation was buried under a substantial thickness of ice.|$|E
25|$|This {{notion of}} <b>slow</b> <b>cooling</b> {{implemented}} in the Simulated Annealing algorithm is interpreted as a slow decrease in the probability of accepting worse solutions as the solution space is explored. Accepting worse solutions is a fundamental property of metaheuristics because it allows for a more extensive search for the global optimal solution. In general, the Simulated Annealing algorithms work as follows. At each time step, the algorithm randomly selects a solution close to the current one, measures its quality, and then decides to move to it or {{to stay with the}} current solution based on either one of two probabilities between which it chooses {{on the basis of the}} fact that the new solution is better or worse than the current one. During the search, the temperature is progressively decreased from an initial positive value to zero and affects the two probabilities: at each step, the probability of moving to a better new solution is either kept to 1 or is changed towards a positive value; instead, the probability of moving to a worse new solution is progressively changed towards zero.|$|E

500|$|After formation, Ganymede's core largely {{retained}} the heat accumulated during accretion and differentiation, only slowly releasing {{it to the}} ice mantle [...] The mantle, in turn, transported it to the surface by convection.

With this, Ganymede became a fully differentiated body [...] By comparison, the radioactive heating of undifferentiated Callisto caused convection in its icy interior, which effectively cooled it and prevented large-scale melting of ice and rapid differentiation. The convective motions in Callisto have caused only a partial separation of rock and ice. Today, Ganymede continues to cool slowly.

They are significant to understand energy and mass transport in the solar atmosphere. Recently, the high-speed transition region jets are reported from the observation.

Driven by the supergranular convection motion, the magnetic reconnection between the magnetic loop and the background open flux occurring in the transition region is simulated with a two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics model. The simulation results show that not only a fast hot jet, much resemble the found transition region jets, but also a adjacent <b>slow</b> <b>cool</b> jet, mostly like classical spicules, is launched.
