50|$|Slabs in {{prestressed}} concrete are usually produced in lengths {{of up to}} 200 meters. The process involves extruding wet concrete along with the prestressed steel wire rope from a moving mold. The continuous slab is then cut by big diamond circular saw according to the lengths (and <b>width)</b> <b>required</b> on blueprint. Factory production provides the obvious advantages of reduced time, labor and training.|$|R
50|$|In the 17th century, a stylus {{that could}} {{draw a line}} with a <b>specific</b> <b>width</b> called a ruling pen was developed.

40|$|Abstract—With {{continuing}} speed {{increases of}} communication links found {{both inside and}} outside the servers in a data center, link power management is becoming an important issue. In this paper we examine width control of such links and show that it provides substantial benefits over other methods for latency sensitive applications. The paper also presents the design of a <b>specific</b> <b>width</b> control algorithm called DWCA (dynamic width control algorithm) that is effective and easily implemented in hardware at high data rates...|$|R
50|$|Kits are {{produced}} by Steam Era Models for the short, clerestory-roofed AW and BW carriages; these can be kitbashed into the longer type carriages, except for the additional <b>width</b> <b>required</b> for accuracy. Resin-cast curved roofs are available for purchase separately in both short and long versions, from either Blue and Gold models, or End of the Line Hobbies in Adelaide. The latter company also offers kit construction services, so {{it is possible to}} have a carriage built and posted.|$|R
50|$|The Elrod was {{a machine}} used to cast rules and spacing {{material}} (leading), of a <b>specific</b> <b>width</b> 1,1½, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36pt, this was used extensively in page layout and line spacing, that is adjusting the white space between paragraphs {{and any other}} area when small bits of white space were needed. Large areas of white space were created by wooden or later metal blocks called 'furniture'. Smaller odd areas were filled with square or rectangular blocks in various point sizes called quads.|$|R
50|$|While the {{contacts}} on SIMMs {{on both sides}} are redundant, DIMMs have separate electrical contacts {{on each side of}} the module. Another difference is that standard SIMMs have a 32-bit data path, while standard DIMMs have a 64-bit data path. Since Intel's Pentium, many processors have a 64-bit bus <b>width,</b> <b>requiring</b> SIMMs installed in matched pairs in order to populate the data bus. The processor would then access the two SIMMs in parallel. DIMMs were introduced to eliminate this disadvantage.|$|R
60|$|The {{improvement}} of the South Pass of the Mississippi River, under James B. Eads and his associates, is progressing favorably. At the present time there is a channel of 20.3 feet in depth between the jetties {{at the mouth of}} the pass and 18.5 feet at the head of the pass. Neither channel, however, has the <b>width</b> <b>required</b> before payments can be made by the United States. A commission of engineer officers is now examining these works, and their reports will be presented as soon as received.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a web based workbench for experimenting with the PID controllers {{of a real}} mobile robot. The first contribution presented {{is the use of}} 3 D reconstruction rather than video streaming for viewing the robot experiments.

The second contribution presented is the use of stored results of experiments to improve the operating efficiency of the experiment platform...|$|R
50|$|ECC has {{a variety}} of unique properties, {{including}} tensile properties superior to other fiber-reinforced composites, ease of processing on par with conventional cement, the use of only a small volume fraction of fibers (~ 2%), tight crack width, and a lack of anisotropically weak planes. These properties are due largely to the interaction between the fibers and cementing matrix, which can be custom-tailored through micromechanics design. Essentially, the fibers create many microcracks with a very <b>specific</b> <b>width,</b> rather than a few very large cracks (as in conventional concrete.) This allows ECC to deform without catastrophic failure.|$|R
50|$|In general, coil {{manufacturers}} purchase {{quantities of}} raw PVC beads, melt the beads {{into a single}} mass, and extrude a single long 'string' of semi-flexible PVC material. This PVC string is wound about a spool much like thread. When an order is received for any specific size and color combination, these long strands of PVC are heated to roughly 120 degrees Fahrenheit by a forming machine and are wrapped around a mandrel which matches the <b>specific</b> <b>width</b> desired. Once cooled and cut to size, the PVC material maintains the coil shape and {{is ready to be}} used for binding.|$|R
40|$|The testing {{time for}} a system-on-chip(SOC) largely depends {{on the design of}} test {{wrappers}} and the test access mechanism(TAM). Wrapper/TAM co-optimization is therefore necessary to minimize SOC testing time. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm to construct wrappers that reduce testing time for cores. We further propose a new approach for wrapper/TAM co-optimization based on two-dimensional rectangle packing. This approach considers the diagonal length of the rectangles to emphasize on both TAM <b>widths</b> <b>required</b> by a core and its corresponding testing time.

50|$|The {{bridge is}} {{wide enough for}} three lines of rails {{on account of the}} <b>width</b> <b>required</b> for the roadway and {{footpaths}} underneath, but only two lines were laid on the top; afterwards a third line was added, and regularly used as a siding, with a dead-end at the Gateshead end. This was in use for many years until converted into a third running line. In an illustration by Leitch, four lines are shewn on the bridge. This shews how little an artist's sketch can be relied upon as an historical data.|$|R
5000|$|Single-action {{airbrush}} technique derives {{its name}} from the fact that only one action is required for operation. The single action of depressing the trigger releases a fixed ratio of paint to air.Achieving different line <b>widths</b> <b>requires</b> either changing the tip and nozzle combination or else adjusting the spray volume manually between spray width changes. The most important aspect of proper single-action airbrush technique is to keep the hand moving before the trigger is depressed and after the trigger is released.

40|$|Multi-combination {{vehicles}} (MCVs) are {{road freight}} vehicles comprising a prime mover towing {{two or more}} trailers. At each articulation point, movements occur due to the driver, vehicle, road and environment such as driver steering, vehicle length, road roughness and side wind loading, respectively. These lateral displacements dictate the lane <b>width</b> <b>required</b> for vehicles using the road and, if ignored or predicted inaccurately, can affect the cost or safety of the road. Previous research (Prem et al., 1999) estimated the lane width requirements for several MCVs on two routes with average roughness. In this current study, a full scale testing programme was undertaken on a rough road to measure the lateral displacement of the rear trailer of a B-Double on a nominally straight path. Video footage was recorded during the tests from a camera {{on the top of}} the prime mover which was aimed at target boards at the rear of the vehicle. Lateral movements of the trailers were extracted from the video data – these were relative to a moving frame of reference, namely the prime mover which was subject to driver steering inputs. Corrections were made for the relative angle between the prime mover and the trailers, which was found to vary with the applied steering angle. These corrections were found to result in an increased estimate of the lateral displacement and hence the lane <b>width</b> <b>required...</b>|$|R

50|$|Finally, SPUIs can be {{somewhat}} difficult to clear of snow. The large {{area in which}} lanes cross {{may have to be}} shut down to allow efficient and thorough cleaning lest a snowplow leave piles of snow, interfering with traffic and visibility {{in the middle of the}} uncontrolled pavement. Additionally, if the wide area of uncontrolled pavement is on a bridge, as in the diagram, the snow cannot be pushed to the sides of the bridge as it may pose a hazard to the road underneath. This problem can be exacerbated by the comparatively large bridge <b>width</b> <b>required</b> by the SPUI.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} meet the {{computing}} speed required by 4 G wireless communications, and to provide the different data processing <b>widths</b> <b>required</b> by different algorithms, an SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) core has been designed. The ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) and main components of the SIMD core are discussed focus on how the SIMD core can be configured. Finally, the simulation result of the multiplication of two 8 * 8 matrices is presented to show the execution of instructions in the proposed SIMD core, and the result verifies the correctness of the SIMD core design...|$|R
