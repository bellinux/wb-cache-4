5|$|A pilot {{episode was}} {{commissioned}} on 1 March 1977 and the recording was completed on 28 June 1977. Brett and Adams recounted {{different parts of}} the pilot episode's genesis, including convincing the BBC that such a programme could not be recorded with a studio audience, and insisting that the programme be recorded in stereo sound. To win the latter argument, Hitchhiker's was briefly classified internally as a drama instead of a comedy, as in 1977 BBC Radio Drama programmes were allowed to be recorded in <b>stereo,</b> <b>and</b> BBC Radio Comedy programmes were not.|$|E

5|$|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is {{a science}} fiction comedy radio series written by Douglas Adams (with some {{material}} in the first series provided by John Lloyd). It was originally broadcast in the United Kingdom by BBC Radio 4 in 1978, and afterwards the BBC World Service, National Public Radio in the U.S. and CBC Radio in Canada. The series was the first radio comedy programme to be produced in <b>stereo,</b> <b>and</b> was innovative in its use of music and sound effects, winning a number of awards.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Let It Be... Naked, a reconceived {{version of}} the Let It Be album, with McCartney supervising production, was released. One of the main {{differences}} with the Spector-produced version was the omission of the original string arrangements. It was a top ten hit in both Britain and America. The US album configurations from 1964 to 1965 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 – The Capitol Albums, Volume 1 and Volume 2 included both <b>stereo</b> <b>and</b> mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl {{at the time of}} the music's original American release.|$|E
5|$|The later Saturn version {{featured}} {{a number of}} changes: an optional easy difficulty setting (providing the player with twice the fire-power and slower fuel consumption), adjustable brightness on the heads-up display; two hidden powerful weapons; hundreds of bug fixes from the PlayStation version; extra sound effects added to helicopters; improvements to the graphics of control and menu screens and compass; <b>stereo</b> <b>and</b> mono versions; cow sound effects; and more improvised fuel added to level 4. It was also compatible with the Saturn's then-recent analogue controllers. The game {{was followed by a}} further sequel, Nuclear Strike, released for the PlayStation in late 1997.|$|E

5|$|This is an escapist anthem {{about leaving}} {{wherever}} you're stuck, {{getting in a}} car, whacking some amazing music on the <b>stereo</b> <b>and</b> putting your foot down. In other words, it's still only when she's dancing that she feels this free, and it's still music making the people come together. It captures a brilliantly teenage sensation ("only music can save me from my shit life") but makes sense {{of it in a}} song that doesn't sound like she's trying too hard to be down with the kids... Real life is sometimes a bit more complicated than that, and sometimes freedom is about being able to leave the cunts behind to get on with their useless lives. And that's what this song is about.|$|E
5|$|To {{mark the}} album's tenth anniversary, The Downward Spiral was re-released on November 23, 2004 in {{high-resolution}} SACD and DualDisc formats. Disc {{one of the}} album's deluxe edition re-release is nearly {{identical to the original}} version; track anomalies such as sounds from previous tracks creeping up on start of tracks are fixed, and it includes a <b>stereo</b> <b>and</b> multi-channel SACD layer. The second bonus disc is a collection of remixes and B-sides and also includes a stereo SACD layer in addition to the Redbook CD layer. The last three tracks on the bonus disc are previously unreleased demo recordings from the original album.|$|E
5|$|The {{music of}} SaGa 1 was {{composed}} by Nobuo Uematsu, {{and that of}} SaGa 2 by Uematsu and Kenji Ito, while the music of SaGa 3 was composed by Ryuji Sasai and Chihiro Fujioka. Uematsu has stated that while SaGa 1s music could be made of better quality, the emphasis was on enjoying the game, and not solely its appearance or sound. The Game Boy's sound hardware was {{different from that of}} the Famicom, which Uematsu was used to composing for at the time, with new <b>stereo</b> <b>and</b> waveforms and only three notes; as a result, Uematsu struggled with deciding how to work with these, developing new themes for the music in the process despite SaGa 1s director Akitoshi Kawazu's desire to have the music be in the same vein as Square's preceding Final Fantasy titles. Uematsu has stated that the Game Boy was a system he would like to compose for again. SaGa 2 was the first soundtrack or album that Kenji Ito worked on.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{analysis}} of the solar wind discontinues geometry on Earth’s orbit based on measurements of Wind, ACE, <b>STEREO</b> A, <b>and</b> <b>STEREO</b> B is proposed. A case study of three discontinuities events basing on STEREO A, <b>STEREO</b> B, ACE <b>and</b> Wind measurements is presented. The different spacecraft normal direction dependence on the cross spacecraft distance has been analyzed. The estimated shock front curvature radius value {{have been found to}} be independent on spatial scale in the range of <b>STEREO</b> A <b>and</b> <b>STEREO</b> B observation (about 4000 RE). The curvature radii of processed events were found to be of the order of thousand RE...|$|R
