30|$|In {{this section}} we utilize D 2 D {{communication}} to enable relaying between users {{in order to}} improve the coverage in a microcellular urban network. We compute the performance of the direct link and the relay-assisted link in terms of SINR values, which are obtained with the lite simulation mode of the Vienna 5 G SL simulator explained in Section 4.2. 1. Our simulator is able to carry out uplink, downlink and <b>sidelink</b> transmission in one single simulation. Since most traffic and control signaling takes place in the downlink band, we consider the <b>sidelink</b> to be integrated into the uplink.|$|E
40|$|Massive Machine Type Communication (mMTC) {{to serve}} billions of IoT devices is {{considered}} to open a potential new market {{for the next generation}} cellular network. Legacy cellular networks cannot meet the requirements of emerging mMTC applications, since they were designed for human-driven services. In order to provide supports for mMTC services, current research and standardization work focus on the improvement and adaptation of legacy networks. However, these solutions face challenges to enhance the service availability and improve the battery life of mMTC devices simultaneously. In this article, we propose to exploit a network controlled <b>sidelink</b> communication scheme to enable cellular network with better support for mMTC services. Moreover, a context-aware algorithm is applied to ensure the efficiency of the proposed scheme and multiple context information of devices are taken into account. Correspondingly, signaling schemes are also designed and illustrated in this work to facilitate the proposed technology. The signaling schemes enable the network to collect required context information with light signaling effort and thus network can derive a smart configuration for both the <b>sidelink</b> and cellular link. In order to demonstrate the improvements brought by our scheme, a system-level simulator is implemented and numerical results show that our scheme can simultaneously enhance both the service availability and battery life of sensors.

40|$|International audienceDevice-to-device (D 2 D) {{communications}} for Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks {{relies on a}} discovery process to enable User Equipment (UE) to determine which D 2 D applications and services are supported by neighboring UEs. This {{is especially important for}} groups of UEs that operate outside the coverage area of any base station. The amount of time required for discovery information to reach every UE in a group depends on the number of UEs in the group and the dimensions of the discovery resource pool associated with the Physical <b>Sidelink</b> Discovery Channel (PSDCH); an additional factor is the half-duplex property of current UEs. In this paper, we use a Markov chain to characterize the performance of Mode 2 direct discovery. The resulting analytical model gives the distribution of the time for a UE to discover all other UEs in its group. We validate the model using Monte Carlo and network simulation...|$|E
40|$|One-to-one {{device-to-device}} (D 2 D) communications {{are expected}} {{to play a major}} role in future releases of LTE-A, as well as in future 5 G networks. Despite the abundance of works on resource allocation for D 2 D communications, few works, if any, discuss how D 2 D should be realized within the LTE-A protocol stack. While it is generally understood that D 2 D endpoints should be able to communicate both on the direct path or <b>sidelink</b> (SL) and on the relayed path (RP) through the eNB, little has been said on how this can be achieved in practice. In this paper we present a comprehensive proposal for a data-plane architecture for D 2 D communication: we define how communications should occur on the SL and the RP, and propose a solution for the challenges associated with mode switching between the SL and the RP. In particular, we argue that two different communication modes on the RP are required to allow D 2 D connections to be kept alive across cell borders in a multicell environment. Our proposal is scalable, since it does not require any signaling, and is guaranteed to not introduce losses. We evaluate our proposal through detailed system-level simulations, also focusing on its interplay with transport-layer protocols...|$|E
