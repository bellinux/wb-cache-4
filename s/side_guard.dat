2500|$|An SS option {{remained}} available, but it {{was merely}} a $123 dress-up package that included a blackout grille and Rally wheels. It could be ordered {{with any of the}} Nova engines. 35,542 SS packages were installed, making 1973 the best-selling year for the option. A modified rear side window shape was also introduced, eliminating the vent windows on both two- and four-door models. A revised rear suspension was adapted from the second generation Camaro with multi-leaf springs replacing the mono-leaf springs used on Novas since the original 1962 model. By this time, six-cylinder and V8 engines were de rigueur for American compact cars, with the [...] and [...] V8s becoming fairly common. The 1973 Nova with a six-cylinder engine or 307 cu. in.(5.0 L) [...] V8 were among the last Chevrolets to be offered with the two-speed Powerglide automatic transmission, which was in its final year. A dressy Custom series joined the Nova line and a Custom hatchback listed for $2,701 with a six-cylinder engine. That was $173 more than the six-cylinder base-model two-door hatchback. Air conditioning added $381. Every 1973 Chevrolet Nova got <b>side</b> <b>guard</b> door beams and additional sound insulation, as well as flow-through ventilation systems. A sunroof could be installed, and fold-down rear seats were available.|$|E

Lines of officials on each <b>side</b> <b>guard</b> the way. On the deck of the steamer, as soon as you get on board, you find a great variety of picturesque looking groups, all, however, having the air of being travellers for pleasure. Some are arranging themselves in good seats for seeing the scenery. Others take out their maps and guide books, and prepare to read the descriptions of the places that they are going to see. Here and there children are to be seen--the boys with little knapsacks, and the girls wearing very broad-brimmed Swiss hats--neither paying any attention to the scenery, but amusing themselves with whatever they find at hand to play with--one with a little dog, another with a doll which has been bought for her at Geneva, and a third, perhaps, with a whip, or a little wagon.|$|E

The work {{included}} repairing of Eastern <b>side</b> <b>guard</b> wall of lake, construction of path way with granite stone paving, widening of 18 m wide road under I.R.D.P., road <b>side</b> <b>guard</b> wall and landscaping berms, parking and garden bays on other side of road, fixing decorative lamp, benches, attractive dust bins etc. For watering of plants and landscaping, sprinkler system was provided. For sufficient lighting purpose, four high masts were fixed in the vicinity of lake. Two colored fountains of 15 feet and one white and fountain of 100 feet, as such total three floating fountains were set up in lake [...] The work of Immersion Ghat with three ramps on South side and guard wall of lake with sand beach on North side was also done in the same phase.|$|E

5000|$|Floating bridges were {{historically}} constructed using wood. Pontoons {{were formed}} by simply lashing several barrels together, by rafts of timbers, or by using boats. Each bridge section consisted {{of one or}} more pontoons, which were maneuvered into position and then anchored underwater or on land. The pontoons were linked together using wooden stringers called balks. The balks were covered by a series of cross planks called chesses to form the road surface, and the chesses were secured with <b>side</b> <b>guard</b> rails.|$|E

5000|$|The base Miami {{front is}} an [...] "over" [...] front, with a nose tackle shaded weak {{side to the}} center, a {{defensive}} tackle shaded outside the strong <b>side</b> <b>guard,</b> a defensive end shaded outside the tight end, and the weakside end outside the offensive tackle. Each lineman is assigned one gap. Linebackers are stationed about 4 to 4.5 yards behind the line of scrimmage. This differs from the old Landry 4-3 defenses, in which linebackers are within 1.5 yards {{of the line of}} scrimmage.|$|E
50|$|Essentially, a power run is {{a running}} play with two lead blockers; the fullback and the {{backside}} offensive guard. A typical blocking scheme for a power run {{is for the}} linemen to down block the man in their inside gap. The fullback will kick out (block) the last man on {{the line of scrimmage}} (an outside linebacker or wide defensive end) and the back <b>side</b> <b>guard</b> will pull and lead up either the guard/tackle hole or the tackle/tight end hole and block the remaining linebacker or defensive back.|$|E
5000|$|Defensive ends: The weak side {{defensive}} end lines up {{one to two}} yards outside the weak offensive tackle. The strong side {{defensive end}} lines up on the outside shoulder of the strong <b>side</b> <b>guard.</b> The object of the weak side defensive end against the run is to protect against reverses and counters. Otherwise on pass plays he goes after the quarterback. The strong side defensive end {{is to make sure}} the offensive guard in front of him does not push him inside and does not get released to block the linebacker.|$|E

50|$|Slightly {{splitting}} offensive ends, called flexing, was in {{widespread use}} by Notre Dame's Box {{variation of the}} single-wing. Knute Rockne's Notre Dame Box offense employed a balanced line, which had 3 linemen {{on each side of}} the center. Another Rockne innovation was a shifting backfield that attempted to confuse the defense by moving backs to alternate positions right before the snap.Another variation of the single-wing saw the quarterback move out as a wingback on the weak side. Besides adding different blocking angles for the quarterback, the double-wing formation facilitated the passing game. Stanford had a variation on the double-wing in which the quarterback stayed right behind the strong <b>side</b> <b>guard,</b> while the tailback became the wingback to the weak side. The fullback, being the only deep back left, took all the snaps and directed the plays.|$|E
5000|$|The 3-4 has {{two basic}} {{defensive}} variations: the one-gap and the two-gap. In a two-gap system, the linemen {{are charged with}} tying up two blockers. This allows the linebackers to [...] "flow downhill" [...] and make tackles without shedding blocks. The one gap, on the other hand, distributes the responsibility for gap coverage evenly between the linemen and linebackers. Each player has a few [...] "key reads" [...] after the ball is snapped. For example, the middle linebacker may be covering the strong side A gap (gap between center and strong <b>side</b> <b>guard).</b> If he sees the guard move right, then he flows with the guard, moving more or less laterally parallel {{to the line of}} scrimmage. If the guard moves left, he attacks downhill (perpendicular to the line of scrimmage) and [...] "shoots his gap." [...] Responsibilities in the one gap vary depending on the defense.|$|E
5000|$|The {{main span}} of the Manahawkin Bay Bridge sports a unique roadway {{lighting}} system, unofficially dubbed the String of Pearls, was designed by NJDOT engineer Dorland J. Henderson; the bridge was officially named after him in 2000. The lighting system, which {{is made up of}} 768 separate fluorescent lights recessed in the bridge's <b>side</b> <b>guard</b> rails, was {{the first of its kind}} in the world. After being in continuous operation since the 1950s, replacement parts for the lighting system have become unavailable, rendering many of the fluorescent bulbs dark and irreplaceable. The original, fluorescent [...] "String of Pearls" [...] lighting system is being replaced by a modern LED lighting system mimicking the [...] "String of Pearls" [...] effect on the north and south exterior faces of the rehabilitated and new bridge spans, respectively. However, unlike the original, the new side rail lights will be for ornamental purposes as the roadway itself will be lit by traditional overhead lighting. In time for Memorial Day weekend 2016, the new lighting system on the south exterior face of the new bridge was illuminated. The north face will not be illuminated until restoration of the original bridge is completed.|$|E

A forebuilding {{attached to the}} north <b>side</b> <b>guarded</b> the entrance. A stone staircase began {{on the west side}} of the keep before turning and meeting the forebuilding, which could be entered by crossing a drawbridge across a gap [...] wide. There was another entrance in the west of the forebuilding, and at some point a new doorway was knocked through to the keep at the bottom of the drawbridge pit. The original door from the forebuilding into the keep was protected by a portcullis.|$|R
50|$|A {{body kit}} or bodykit {{is a set}} of {{modified}} body parts or additional components that install on a stock car. Typically composed of front and rear bumpers, side skirts, spoilers, paint jobs, and sometimes front and rear <b>side</b> <b>guards</b> and roof scoops. There are many companies that offer alternatives to the original factory appearance of the vehicle. Body kits components are designed to complement each other and work together as a complete design. Despite this, the 'mix and match' approach is often seen on cars, where the front of one body kit will be matched with the rear of another, for example.|$|R

50|$|On Monday 14 April 1997 at 1:59am Bargo Bush Fire Brigade (now {{known as}} Bargo Rural Fire Brigade) {{received}} a call to attend a Motor Vehicle Accident (MVA) northbound on the Hume Highway, {{just south of the}} Bargo exit. The crew pulled out of the station in Bargo 4 (Cat 9) & Bargo 1 (Cat 1).The crew arrived onto the highway heading south, responding to assist Mittagong brigade hazmat for an oil spill that was located on the north bound side at the Tennessee Orchiad. The crew were travelling along the freeway at the southern Bargo exit ramp and approached a Police car sitting {{on the side of the}} road in the southbound lanes trying to slow traffic down from the MVA on the northbound side. Bargo 4 {{received a call}} from Bargo 1 to say that the visibility was poor due to heavy fog. As the crew travelled further down the freeway, they reached extremely poor conditions and hit the fog really bad. All emergency lights were turned on, but the crew could still see nothing. The crew pulled over on the left side near the <b>side</b> <b>guard</b> railing to see if they could see anything. Nothing was visible, so one crew member went to get out of the truck to help direct Bargo 1 to the north-bound MVA. As the member opened the door and started to climb down, next minute, a large bang occurred - Bargo 1 got hit from the rear by a paper truck that was travelling along at 110 km/h. Bargo 1 was hit so hard that the truck spun around and left the crew member lying in the middle of the road. As Bargo 1 sat on the side of the road, with the left side facing towards to the south bound traffic. The driver was stuck inside the truck with the door jammed. While the rest of the crew were assisting the member injured climbing out that was lying on the road. As the driver was stuck inside, the truck was hit by a blue circle cement tanker that was travelling at a speed of 83 km/h. Bargo 1 almost rolled but was stopped by the <b>side</b> <b>guard</b> rail. A crew member jumped up and dragged the trapped driver out of the right hand window. As they jumped out of the truck, another bang was heard, then another and then another. The crew tried to get further away from the road, as they heard more trucks coming in, another bang was heard, then another, then another.|$|E

5000|$|First, {{the quarterback}} {{receives}} the football from the center. The quarterback then starts the play {{in one direction}} by appearing to hand the football to the fullback right behind the play <b>side</b> <b>guard</b> on a standard fullback dive play. The guard [...] "chips" [...] the 3-technique (defensive tackle) and blocks the play side (the side where the play is going) inside linebacker (usually called the [...] "mike", or middle linebacker). The quarterback then reads the unblocked defensive lineman. If the lineman attacks the fullback, the quarterback pulls the ball from the fullback's gut and continues down the line, but if the defensive lineman goes outside to contain the play, he hands off inside to the fullback. The offensive tackle {{on the side of}} the play's direction does not block the defensive end and instead moves to block the first threat, usually the linebacker stacked behind the defensive end. In the traditional triple option the backside tailback will take a parallel course down the line of scrimmage keeping a three to five yard separation from the quarterback. If the defensive end comes inside toward the quarterback, he will pitch it outside to the trailing halfback. If the defensive end retains outside leverage and plays the trailing halfback, the quarterback will keep the ball and run upfield inside of the defensive end. The tailback to the play side is responsible for blocking one of the defensive backs, usually one of the deep safeties. The wide receiver (WR) to the play side is responsible for blocking the corner back assigned to cover them if the defense were playing man coverage.|$|E
