5|$|The {{science of}} <b>stellar</b> {{spectroscopy}} was pioneered by Joseph von Fraunhofer and Angelo Secchi. By comparing the spectra of {{stars such as}} Sirius to the Sun, they found differences in the strength and number of their absorption lines—the dark lines in a <b>stellar</b> spectra caused by the atmosphere's absorption of specific frequencies. In 1865 Secchi began classifying stars into spectral types. However, the modern version of the <b>stellar</b> classification scheme was developed by Annie J. Cannon during the 1900s.|$|E
5|$|What is {{the origin}} of the <b>stellar</b> mass spectrum? That is, why do astronomers observe the same {{distribution}} of <b>stellar</b> masses– the initial mass function– apparently regardless of the initial conditions? A deeper understanding of the formation of stars and planets is needed.|$|E
5|$|About half {{a billion}} years ago, the newly {{captured}} star began to expand into a red giant (see <b>stellar</b> evolution).|$|E
5|$|Ages for star {{clusters}} {{can be estimated}} by comparing the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram for the cluster with theoretical models of <b>stellar</b> evolution. Using this technique, ages for the Pleiades of between 75 and 150 million years have been estimated. The wide spread in estimated ages {{is a result of}} uncertainties in <b>stellar</b> evolution models, which include factors such as convective overshoot, in which a convective zone within a star penetrates an otherwise non-convective zone, resulting in higher apparent ages.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers may {{be close}} to solving this mystery. They noticed a large plume of gas {{extending}} at least six times its <b>stellar</b> radius indicating that Betelgeuse is not shedding matter evenly in all directions. The plume's presence implies that the spherical symmetry of the star's photosphere, often observed in the infrared, is not preserved in its close environment. Asymmetries on the <b>stellar</b> disk had been reported at different wavelengths. However, due to the refined capabilities of the NACO adaptive optics on the VLT, these asymmetries have come into focus. The two mechanisms that could cause such asymmetrical mass loss, were large-scale convection cells or polar mass loss, possibly due to rotation. Probing deeper with ESO's AMBER, gas in the supergiant's extended atmosphere has been observed vigorously moving up and down, creating bubbles {{as large as the}} supergiant itself, leading his team to conclude that such <b>stellar</b> upheaval is behind the massive plume ejection observed by Kervella.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} its lifetime, a {{star with}} more than about 20 solar masses can undergo {{gravitational}} collapse to form a black hole. According to classical physics, these massive <b>stellar</b> objects exert a gravitational attraction that is strong enough to prevent anything, even electromagnetic radiation, from escaping past the Schwarzschild radius. However, quantum mechanical effects are believed to potentially allow the emission of Hawking radiation at this distance. Electrons (and positrons) are thought to be created at the event horizon of these <b>stellar</b> remnants.|$|E

5|$|Free-floating {{planets in}} <b>stellar</b> {{clusters}} have similar velocities {{to the stars}} and so can be recaptured. They are typically captured into wide orbits between 100 and 105 AU. The capture efficiency decreases with increasing cluster volume, and for a given cluster size it increases with the host/primary mass. It is almost independent of the planetary mass. Single and multiple planets could be captured into arbitrary unaligned orbits, non-coplanar with each other or with the <b>stellar</b> host spin, or pre-existing planetary system.|$|E

5|$|Important {{theoretical}} work on {{the physical}} structure of stars occurred during {{the first decades of}} the twentieth century. In 1913, the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram was developed, propelling the astrophysical study of stars. Successful models were developed to explain the interiors of stars and <b>stellar</b> evolution. Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin first proposed that stars were made primarily of hydrogen and helium in her 1925 PhD thesis. The spectra of stars were further understood through advances in quantum physics. This allowed the chemical composition of the <b>stellar</b> atmosphere to be determined.|$|E

Dimmings {{of up to}} 65% for 25 consecutive days (out of 79 total observation) were observed. The variability is highly periodic and attributed to <b>stellar</b> rotation. The researchers hypothesize that the irregular dimmings are caused by either a warped inner-disk edge or transiting cometary-like objects in either circular or eccentric orbits.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the past}} 2 billion years, star {{formation}} throughout Andromeda's disk {{is thought to}} have decreased to the point of near-inactivity. There have been interactions with satellite galaxies like M32, M110, or others that have already been absorbed by Andromeda Galaxy. These interactions have formed structures like Andromeda's Giant <b>Stellar</b> Stream. A galactic merger roughly 100 million years ago is believed to be responsible for a counter-rotating disk of gas found in the center of Andromeda as well as the presence there of a relatively young (100 million years old) <b>stellar</b> population.|$|E

5|$|<b>Stellar</b> {{engines are}} {{a class of}} {{hypothetical}} megastructures whose purpose is to extract useful energy from a star, sometimes for specific purposes.

5|$|The 1950s and 1960s saw two {{developments}} {{that would affect}} <b>stellar</b> convection theory in red supergiants: the Stratoscope projects and the 1958 publication of Structure and Evolution of the Stars, principally the work of Martin Schwarzschild and his colleague at Princeton University, Richard Härm. This book disseminated {{ideas on how to}} apply computer technologies to create <b>stellar</b> models, while the Stratoscope projects, by taking balloon-borne telescopes above the Earth's turbulence, produced some of the finest images of solar granules and sunspots ever seen, thus confirming the existence of convection in the solar atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|The {{combination}} of the distance and proper motion of this system {{can be used to}} compute the transverse velocity of IK Pegasi as 16.9 km/s. The third component, the heliocentric radial velocity, can be measured by the average red-shift (or blue-shift) of the <b>stellar</b> spectrum. The General Catalogue of <b>Stellar</b> Radial Velocities lists a radial velocity of -11.4 km/s for this system. The {{combination of}} these two motions gives a space velocity of 20.4 km/s relative to the Sun.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnetic}} field {{of a star}} interacts with the <b>stellar</b> wind. As the wind {{moves away from the}} star its rate of angular velocity slows. The {{magnetic field}} of the star interacts with the wind, which applies a drag to the <b>stellar</b> rotation. As a result, angular momentum is transferred from the star to the wind, and over time this gradually slows the star's rate of rotation.|$|E
5|$|The mass of Beta Pictoris {{has been}} {{determined}} by using models of <b>stellar</b> evolution and fitting them to the star's observed properties. This method yields a <b>stellar</b> mass between 1.7 and 1.8 solar masses. The star's angular diameter has been measured using interferometry with the Very Large Telescope and {{was found to be}} 0.84 milliarcseconds. Combining this value with the distance of 63.4 light years gives a radius 1.8 times that of the Sun.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} of the bright portion of the nebula is primarily caused by the interaction of a fast <b>stellar</b> wind being emitted by the central PNN with the visible material ejected during {{the formation of the}} nebula. This interaction causes the emission of X-rays discussed above. The <b>stellar</b> wind, blowing with the velocity as high as , has 'hollowed out' the inner bubble of the nebula, and appears to have burst the bubble at both ends.|$|E
5|$|Use of the Fibre-fed Echelle Spectrograph (FIES) at the Nordic Optical Telescope on the Canary Islands on June 4, 2009 {{provided}} {{data that}} was used to determine the star's <b>stellar</b> classification. The W.M. Keck Observatory's High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES), which was used on June 3–6, 2009, and July 2–4, 2009, determined radial velocity measurements for the star, which helped to further define <b>stellar</b> parameters.|$|E
5|$|A <b>stellar</b> {{occultation}} {{observed on}} 21 January 2017 and described in an 11 October 2017 Nature paper indicated {{the presence of}} a ring around Haumea. This represents the first ring system discovered for a TNO.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the exact}} {{size of the}} two outer CO shells remains elusive, {{preliminary}} estimates suggest that one shell extends from about 1.5 to 4.0 arcseconds and the other expands as far as 7.0 arcseconds. Assuming the Jovian orbit of 5.5AU as the star radius, the inner shell would extend roughly 50 to 150 <b>stellar</b> radii (~300 to 800AU) with the outer one as far as 250 <b>stellar</b> radii (~1400AU). The Sun's heliopause is estimated at about 100 AU, so {{the size of this}} outer shell would be almost fourteen {{times the size of the}} Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the wide}} range of astrophysical {{consequences}} of these events, astronomers now deem supernovae research, across the fields of <b>stellar</b> and galactic evolution, as an especially important area for investigation.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{that the}} rings might have gaps first arose during a <b>stellar</b> {{occultation}} in 1984 when the rings obscured {{a star on}} immersion but not on emersion. Images from Voyager 2 in 1989 settled the issue by showing several faint rings.|$|E
5|$|From the corona, a <b>stellar</b> wind of plasma {{particles}} expands {{outward from}} the star, until it interacts with the interstellar medium. For the Sun, the influence of its solar wind extends throughout a bubble-shaped region called the heliosphere.|$|E
5|$|Further {{measurements}} {{which led}} to the discovery of the inner planet 55 Cancri e in 2004 lent support to the planet hypothesis.

The amplitude of the radial velocity signal is inconsistent with <b>stellar</b> variations on stars with 55 Cancri A's low level of chromospheric activity.|$|E
5|$|<b>Stellar</b> {{rotation}} is {{the angular}} motion {{of a star}} about its axis. The rate of rotation can be measured from the spectrum of the star, or by timing the movements of active features on the surface.|$|E
