40|$|Beam Intercepting Devices (BID) are {{designed}} to operate in a harsh radioactive environment and are highly loaded from a thermo-structural point of view. Moreover, modern particle accelerators, storing unprecedented energy, may be exposed to severe accidental events triggered by direct beam impacts. In this context, impulse {{has been given to}} the development of novel materials for advanced thermal management with high thermal shock resistance like metal-diamond and metal-graphite composites on top of refractory metals such as molybdenum, tungsten and copper alloys. This paper presents the results of a first-of-its-kind experiment which exploited 440 GeV proton beams at different intensities to impact samples of the aforementioned materials. Effects of thermally induced shockwaves were acquired via high speed acquisition system including strain gauges, laser Doppler vibrometer and high <b>speed</b> <b>camera.</b> Preliminary <b>information</b> of beam induced damages on materials were also collected. State-of-the-art hydrodynamic codes (like Autodyn®), relying on complex material models including equation of state (EOS), strength and failure models, have been used for the simulation of the experiment. Preliminary results confirm the effectiveness and reliability of these numerical methods when material constitutive models are completely available (W and Cu alloys). For novel composite materials a reverse engineering approach will be used to build appropriate constitutive models, thus allowing a realistic representation of these complex phenomena. These results are of paramount importance for understanding and predicting the response of novel advanced composites to beam impacts in modern particle accelerators. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|R

5000|$|In June 2011, the New South Wales (NSW) {{government}} {{was reported to}} have raised [...] million over the previous five years from <b>speed</b> <b>cameras.</b> [...] The Roads Minister accused the previous Labor government of using <b>speed</b> <b>cameras</b> to raise revenue; the Auditor-General was therefore tasked with investigating all 141 fixed <b>speed</b> <b>cameras</b> in use throughout the state. Following the release of the report, 38 <b>speed</b> <b>cameras,</b> located primarily on highways, were switched off after the Auditor-General determined that they had no significant road safety benefit. The report found the majority of fixed <b>speed</b> <b>cameras</b> had a proven road safety benefit. The report also concluded that it was [...] "too early" [...] to conclude if mobile <b>speed</b> <b>cameras</b> affected road safety, although early results indicated drivers might be speeding less. To address public concerns, the RTA would now monitor the effectiveness of individual fixed <b>speed</b> <b>cameras</b> annually.|$|R

40|$|Since <b>speed</b> <b>cameras</b> were {{introduced}} in Queensland in May 1997 {{there has been a}} steady {{increase in the number of}} <b>speed</b> <b>camera</b> sites and the number of operational hours. However, infringements have not risen in line with this increase in speed enforcement. That is, over time there has been a gradual reduction in the number of speeding infringements issues as a proportion of the number of vehicles' speeds monitored by <b>speed</b> <b>cameras.</b> Superficially this data suggests that <b>speed</b> <b>cameras</b> are effective in reducing speeding. An alternative interpretation is that motorists are reducing their <b>speed</b> at known <b>camera</b> locations, thus avoiding detection, but still speeding at locations where they do not expect to encounter any speed enforcement. If the infringement to vehicles monitored ratio is a system wide indication of the number of motorists speeding, then a decline in this infringement ratio should be roughly parallelled by a corresponding reduction in speed related crashes. This paper will analyse infringement data, <b>speed</b> <b>camera</b> deployment data and speed related crash data in order to clarify the effects that <b>speed</b> <b>cameras</b> are having on speeding and crashes. In particular, the ratio of infringements to the number of hours of <b>speed</b> <b>camera</b> operation, <b>speed</b> related crashes and the surrogate measures of serious injury and fatality crashes will be investigated. Interpretations of the results and recommendations will be made...|$|R
