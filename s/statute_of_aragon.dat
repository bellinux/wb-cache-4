In the 20th century, during the Spanish Civil War, Caspe was the seat of the Regional Defence Council of Aragon. It was also at Caspe where the {{autonomy}} <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> was written, but it could not be ratified by the Cortes Generales due to the civil war being underway.|$|E
50|$|Under the LOREG and the Aragonese electoral law, {{elections}} were fixed {{for the fourth}} Sunday of May every four years. Additionally, the 1982 <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> Autonomy <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> provided that the chamber was to be automatically dissolved and a snap election called if an investiture process failed to elect a regional President within a two-month period from the first ballot, with elected deputies merely serving out {{what remained of the}} previous four-year parliamentary term.|$|R
50|$|Under the Aragonese electoral law, {{elections}} were fixed {{to be held}} within 29 to 35 days from the expiration of the previous four-year parliamentary term.

50|$|Under the LOREG and the Aragonese electoral law, {{elections}} were fixed {{for the fourth}} Sunday of May every four years. This was introduced in several 1991 electoral law amendments that modified the previous wording, which required for an election to be held within 29 to 35 days from the expiration of the previous four-year parliamentary term. Additionally, the 1982 <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> Autonomy <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> provided that the chamber was to be automatically dissolved and a snap election called if an investiture process failed to elect a regional President within a two-month period from the first ballot, with elected deputies merely serving out {{what remained of the}} previous four-year parliamentary term.|$|R
5000|$|Aragon ( [...] or , Spanish and Aragón , Aragó [...] or [...] ) is an {{autonomous}} community in Spain, coextensive with the medieval Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Aragon.</b> Located in northeastern Spain, the Aragonese autonomous community comprises three provinces (from north to south): Huesca, Zaragoza, and Teruel. Its capital is Zaragoza (also called Saragossa in English). The current <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> Autonomy declares <b>Aragon</b> a nationality <b>of</b> Spain.|$|R
50|$|Under the 2007 <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> Autonomy <b>of</b> <b>Aragon,</b> the President <b>of</b> the Government <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> had the {{prerogative}} {{to dissolve}} the Cortes and call a snap election, provided that no motion of censure process was ongoing and some time requirements were met—namely, that dissolution did not occur before one year had passed since the previous one—. Additionally, the chamber's dissolution was to be automatically triggered if an investiture process failed to elect a regional President within a two-month period from the first ballot.|$|R
50|$|The {{electoral system}} for the Cortes <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> was {{regulated}} under transitory provisions in the 1982 <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> Autonomy <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> and, subsidiarily, under the general provisions of the Electoral Rules Decree-Law 20/1977. The Cortes was composed of 66 seats, allocated to Huesca (18), Teruel (16) and Zaragoza (32). Deputies were elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with a threshold of 3% of valid votes—which included blank ballots—being applied in each constituency. Parties not reaching the threshold were not taken into consideration for seat distribution.|$|R
50|$|Under the LOREG and the Aragonese electoral law, {{elections}} were fixed {{for the fourth}} Sunday of May every four years. A 1996 amendment to the 1982 <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> Autonomy <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> granted the President of the Deputation <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> the prerogative to dissolve the Assembly and call a snap election, provided that no motion of censure process was ongoing and some time requirements were met—namely, that dissolution did not occur during the first period of sessions, nor before one year had passed since the previous dissolution or after three years into the parliamentary term—. Additionally, the chamber's dissolution was to be automatically triggered if an investiture process failed to elect a regional President within a two-month period from the first ballot. Any snap election held {{as a result of}} these circumstances would not alter the period to the next ordinary election, with elected deputies merely serving out what remained of the previous four-year parliamentary term.|$|R
50|$|The modern Corts were {{established}} in 1983 under Article 12 <b>of</b> the <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> Autonomy for <b>Aragon.</b> This statute also sets out {{the functions of the}} Aragonese assembly in Article 16 and these include the election of the President <b>of</b> <b>Aragon,</b> approving the actions and legislation of the President, creating legislation, amending the Constitution <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> and supervising any relevant planning or economic projects. It must monitor borrowing and spending and appoint an Auditor General for Aragon. Additionally the legislature must elect the appropriate number of Senators to serve in the Spanish Senate.|$|R
50|$|Those actions {{led to a}} Congress {{taking place}} in Caspe (Saragossa) at the {{beginning}} of May in 1936, with Torrente as the chairman. The result was the draft <b>of</b> a <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> Autonomy for <b>Aragon,</b> which would not come to the light due to the onset of the Spanish Civil War. By 1939 the party had ceased to exist.|$|R
5000|$|According to the {{not always}} {{reliable}} historian Zurita, more than 3,000 Jews were baptized {{during the year}} 1414; this probably was not due {{so much to the}} disputation as to the forcible conversions by Vicente Ferrer, who had returned to Aragon. In Guadalajara, as well as in Calatayud, Daroca, Fraga, Barbastro, Caspe, Maella, Tamarite, and Alcolea, many Jewish families submitted to baptism. The persecution of the Jews was now pursued systematically. In the hope of mass-conversions, Benedict issued, on May 11, 1415, a bull consisting of twelve articles, which, in the main, corresponded with the decree ("Pragmática") issued by Catalina, and which had been placed on the <b>statutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> by Fernando. By this bull Jews and neophytes were forbidden to study the Talmud, to read anti-Catholic writings, in particular the work [...] "Macellum" [...] ("Mar Jesu"), to pronounce the names of Jesus, Maria, or the saints, to manufacture communion-cups or other church vessels or accept such as pledges, or to build new synagogues or ornament old ones. Each community might have only one synagogue. Jews were denied all rights of selfjurisdiction, nor might they proceed against [...] "malsines" [...] (accusers). They might hold no public offices, nor might they follow any handicrafts, or act as brokers, matrimonial agents, physicians, apothecaries, or druggists. They were forbidden to bake or sell matzot, or to give them away; neither might they dispose of meat which they were prohibited from eating. They might have no intercourse (sex) with Catholics, nor might they disinherit their baptized children. They should wear the badge at all times, and thrice a year all Jews over twelve, of both sexes, were required to listen to a Catholic sermon. (the bull is reprinted, from a manuscript in the archives of the cathedral in Toledo, by Rios ii. 627-653).|$|R
50|$|The Aragonese Corts (Cortes de Aragón, Cortz d'Aragón, Corts d'Aragó) is the {{regional}} parliament for the Spanish autonomous community <b>of</b> <b>Aragon.</b> The Corts traces its history back to meetings summoned by the Kings <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> {{which began in}} 1162. Abolished in 1707, the Corts were revived in 1983 following the passing <b>of</b> a <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> Autonomy.|$|R
25|$|The flag of Catalonia, {{called the}} Senyera, is a vexillological symbol {{based on the}} heraldic emblem of Counts of Barcelona and the coat of arms of the Crown <b>of</b> <b>Aragon,</b> which {{consists}} <b>of</b> four red stripes on a golden background. It has been an official symbol since the <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> Catalonia of 1932.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> Morella {{proposed}} that {{the flag of the}} autonomous community be the Senyera with the royal coat of arms at the centre (those of Peter III <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> (1336 - 87), who did much to formalize the autonomy of the Kingdom of Valencia within the Crown <b>of</b> <b>Aragon).</b> This was adopted as the flag of the Consell del País Valencià on 24 April 1979: however the decision was seen as aprovocation by the UCD, coming as it did after electionswhich would have given the centre-right a majority on the Consell but before the new Consell could be constituted.|$|R
50|$|The amended Autonomy <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> Catalonia {{has also}} been legally contested by the {{surrounding}} Autonomous Communities <b>of</b> <b>Aragon,</b> Balearic Islands and the Valencian Community on similar grounds {{as those of the}} PP, and others such as disputed cultural heritage. As of January 2008, the Constitutional Court of Spain has those alleged breaches and its actual compliance with the Constitution under judicial review.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{with the}} {{conservative}} People's Party opposing the Catalan <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> Autonomy, {{as well as the}} recognition for the language in the east <b>of</b> <b>Aragon,</b> Pujol has stated that, at least since before the Spanish transition to democracy, [...] "there is more aggression towards Catalonia than ever", and that Catalans can [...] "no longer hope for anything from the Spanish state".|$|R
50|$|Some {{lands of}} the Crown <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> (Aragon, Catalonia and Valencia) and the Kingdom of Navarre were self-governing {{entities}} until the Nueva Planta Decrees of 1707 abolished their autonomy and united Aragon with Castile in a centralised Spanish state. The abolition in the realms <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> was completed by 1716, whilst Navarre retained its autonomy until the 1833 territorial division of Spain. It {{is the only one}} of the Spanish territories whose current status in the Spanish state is legally linked with the old Fueros: its <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> Autonomy specifically cites them and recognizes their special status, while also recognizing the supremacy of the Spanish Constitution.|$|R

50|$|After the {{invasion}} launched by James I <b>of</b> <b>Aragon,</b> Nuño Sánchez received from him {{the land of}} Manacor. In 1300, James II granted Manacor a <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> municipality. The Torre del Palau and the fortification of some rural houses like the Torre de ses Puntes and the Torre dels Enagistes have been preserved from the beginnings of town planning at Manacor. A native of Manacor, Simó Tort, was a character in medieval social conflicts.|$|R
5000|$|The Corts Valencianes (...) , {{commonly}} known as Les Corts (...) , are the main legislative body of the Generalitat Valenciana and therefore of the Valencian Community. The main location of the Corts is in the Palace of the Borgias in Valencia; however it can meet at any location in Valencian territory. The Corts has its origins in bodies established {{in the thirteenth century}} by King James I <b>of</b> <b>Aragon.</b> The modern institution was established in 1982 under the Valencian <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> autonomy of 1982. The current Corts were elected in 2015.|$|R
50|$|In {{the past}} {{it was an}} {{independent}} kingdom that, along with others, created the Crown <b>of</b> <b>Aragon,</b> that later merged with the Crown of Castile to forge Spain. While there is some pro-independence support, most of Aragon's population does not seek an independent state but to be fully recognized as a distinct and important region in Spain. There is also a claim for the Aragonese language, spoken in the northernmost area, to enjoy full official support. Its <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> Autonomy defines this region as a nationality.|$|R
2500|$|The Preamble <b>of</b> the 2006 <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> Autonomy of Catalonia {{states that}} the Parliament of Catalonia has defined Catalonia as a nation, but that [...] "the Spanish Constitution recognizes Catalonia's {{national}} reality as a nationality". While the Statute was approved by and sanctioned by both the Catalan and Spanish parliaments, and later by referendum in Catalonia, it has been subject to a legal challenge by the surrounding autonomous communities <b>of</b> <b>Aragon,</b> Balearic Islands and Valencia, {{as well as by}} the conservative People's Party. The objections are based on various issues such as disputed cultural heritage but, especially, on the <b>Statute's</b> alleged breaches <b>of</b> the principle of [...] "solidarity between regions" [...] in fiscal and educational matters enshrined by the Constitution.|$|R
2500|$|The Inquisition {{was created}} through papal bull, Ad Abolendam, issued {{at the end}} of the twelfth century by Pope Lucius III as a way to combat the Albigensian heresy in {{southern}} France. There were a huge number of tribunals of the Papal Inquisition in various European kingdoms during the Middle Ages. In the Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Aragon,</b> a tribunal <b>of</b> the Papal Inquisition was established by the <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> Excommunicamus of Pope Gregory IX, in 1232, during the era of the Albigensian heresy. Although not an inquisitor, as canon lawyer and an advisor to James I <b>of</b> <b>Aragon,</b> Raymond <b>of</b> Penyafort was often consulted regarding questions of law regarding the practices of the Inquisition in the king's domains. [...] "...he lawyer's deep sense of justice and equity, combined with the worthy Dominican's sense of compassion, allowed him to steer clear of the excesses that were found elsewhere in the formative years of the inquisitions into heresy." [...] With time, its importance was diluted, and, by the middle of the fifteenth century, it was almost forgotten although still there according to the law.|$|R
25|$|According to its <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> Autonomy, the Valencian {{people are}} a nationality. Their origins {{date back to the}} Catalan-Aragonese {{colonization}} of the Moorish Taifa of Valencia, which was taken by James I <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> in 1238 during the Reconquista. The newly founded Kingdom of Valencia was granted wide self-government under the Crown <b>of</b> <b>Aragon.</b> Valencia experienced its golden age in the 15th century, as it became the Crown's economic capital and contributed with the most important works of Catalan medieval literature. Self-government continued after the unification of the Spanish Kingdom, but was eventually suspended in 1707 by Phillip V of Spain {{as a result of the}} Spanish War of Succession. Valencian nationalism resurged towards the end of the 19th century, which led to the modern conception of the Valencian Country. Self-government under the Generalitat Valenciana was finally reestablished in 1982 after Spanish transition to democracy.|$|R

50|$|The dynastic {{union in}} 1137 between Petronila, Queen <b>of</b> <b>Aragon,</b> and Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona, {{produced}} a son, Alfonso II <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> who inherited all their respective territories creating the Crown <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> which included all lands and people, titles and states previously {{outside of the}} Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Aragon.</b> The Crown <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> was effectively abolished after the dynastic union with Castile (1469, see below) but the title continued to be used until 1714.

50|$|The throne <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> fell vacant in 1410 (Louis {{was then}} 6 years old) when king Martin I <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> died.

50|$|As the {{surviving}} daughter of King John I <b>of</b> <b>Aragon,</b> she claimed the throne <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> after {{the deaths of}} her elder sister Joanna, Countess of Foix, and her uncle, King Martin I. However, unclear though they were, the laws <b>of</b> succession for <b>Aragon</b> and Barcelona at that time were understood to favour all male relatives over the females (which is how Yolande's uncle Martin <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> came to inherit the throne <b>of</b> <b>Aragon).</b> Martin died without surviving issue in 1410, and after two years without a king, the Estates <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> elected Ferdinand, the second son <b>of</b> Eleanor <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> and John I of Castile, as the next King <b>of</b> <b>Aragon.</b>|$|R
50|$|Joanna <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> (Barcelona 7 November 1344-Castellón, Ampurias 1385) was {{the second}} child of Peter IV <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> and his first wife Maria of Navarre.

50|$|In 1531 Barnes {{returned}} to England, {{becoming one of}} the chief intermediaries between the English government and Lutheran Germany. In 1535 he was sent to Germany in the hope of inducing Lutheran divines to approve of Henry's divorce from Catherine <b>of</b> <b>Aragon,</b> and four years later he was employed in negotiations connected with Anne of Cleves's marriage. The policy was Cromwell's, but Henry VIII had already in 1538 refused to adopt Lutheran theology, and the <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> Six Articles (1539), followed by the king's unsuccessful marriage to Anne of Cleves (1540), brought the agents of that policy to ruin.|$|R
50|$|The Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Aragón</b> {{gave the}} name to the Crown <b>of</b> <b>Aragon,</b> born in 1150 with the dynastic union {{resulting}} from the marriage of the Queen <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> (Petronilla <b>of</b> <b>Aragon)</b> and the Count of Barcelona (Ramon Berenguer IV); their son Alfonso II would inherit all different territories in the House <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> and the House of Barcelona. The King <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> had also the title of Count of Barcelona and ruled territories that consisted of not only the present administrative region <b>of</b> <b>Aragon</b> but also Catalonia, and later the kingdoms of Majorca, Valencia, Sicily, Naples and Sardinia. The King <b>of</b> <b>Aragón</b> was the direct King of the Aragonese region, and held also the title of Count of Provence, Count of Barcelona, Lord of Montpellier, and Duke of Athens and Neopatria. Each of these titles gave him sovereignty over a certain region, and these titles changed as he lost and won territories. In the 14th century, his power was greatly restricted by the Union <b>of</b> <b>Aragon.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1463, the Catalan institutions, {{which were}} in civil war with John II <b>of</b> <b>Aragon,</b> offered their crown to Peter.
