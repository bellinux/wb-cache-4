40|$|Abstract. In this paper, One-step {{pyrolysis}} {{process for}} the recovery of mercury and zinc from spent zinc–manganese batteries is proposed. Laboratory tests were performed to remove mercury and zinc from spent batteries and recover them. Correctitude test were {{used to analyze the}} effect of three factors: temperature, weight and time on the <b>removing</b> and recovery <b>efficiency</b> of zinc. In this research, temperature is dominant factor, weight and time are subordinate. After removing mercury, higher temperature could assure the <b>removing</b> <b>efficiency</b> of mercury above 99. 9 % at the same time of removing zinc. Under 0. 02 MPa, <b>efficiency</b> of <b>removing</b> and recycling of zinc were investigated. The <b>removing</b> <b>efficiency</b> is 94. 2 % at 950 °C and 96. 2 % at 1000 °C. When the heated time is 1. 5 h, the <b>removing</b> <b>efficiency</b> is 95. 6 %, which reach the aim 95. 0 %. With the increase of sample weight, the necessary heated time could be kept within 2. 5 h without the loss of <b>removing</b> <b>efficiency.</b> The recycling efficiency of zinc could approach 75 %. The content of zinc is above 99. 0 % in condensed zinc product. After being treated, the residue mass is about 40 % of sample...|$|R

40|$|Diameter {{and depth}} of craters and <b>removing</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the {{material}} of RCCR (resin coated copper) used in PCB by a single pulse energy of 355 nm YAG laser {{with a variety of}} pulse energy, pulse width and defocus have been studied in the paper. It is shown that the ablation rates per pulse are much higher when compared with those at 248 nm. The crater diameter increases monotonically with the pulse energy. However, when the pulse energy is very high and the power density is higher than 4. 0 × 109 W/cm 2, the crater depth and <b>removing</b> <b>efficiency</b> decrease with the increase of pulse energy. The pulse width has an important influence on the crater diameter and volume when the pulse width changes from 24 ns to 38 ns, whereas the influence on the crater depth is little. The influences of defocus on ablation results depend on the power density of laser beam. A certain defocus can make both crater diameter and <b>removing</b> <b>efficiency</b> increase for a relatively high power density. Meanwhile, the thermal effect in the process of 355 nm laser ablution of RCCR cannot be neglected. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R
50|$|Miso soup can be {{prepared}} in several ways, depending on the chef and the style of soup. Japanese recipes usually call for most vegetables and meats to be cooked in the simmering dashi, particularly mushrooms, daikon, carrots, potatoes, tofu, and fish. The miso is suspended separately in some dashi <b>stock</b> <b>removed</b> from the simmering mix, to keep the miso paste from cooking, which alters the flavour, kills beneficial bacteria, and reduces {{the health benefits of}} biologically active miso paste. When the vegetables are cooked, the <b>stock</b> is <b>removed</b> from heat, the miso suspension is added and mixed into the soup, any uncooked ingredients are added, and the dish is served.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. According to the {{principle}} of bubble floatation, purification of ZL 114 aluminum casting alloy has been studied by blowing nitrogen gas into the ZL 114 A alloy melt through the porous plug which can produce dispersed micro bubbles. 5 samples have been taken at 0 min, 2 min, 4 min, 6 min, 8 min and 10 min, respectively, to measure the hydrogen content through HYSCAN hydrogen tester. The experiments results show that the removing effect of hydrogen is remarkable. The hydrogen <b>removing</b> <b>efficiency</b> reaches 85. 7 % when blowing lasts 4 minutes. The rate of hydrogen removing begins to decrease from 4 minutes to 10 minutes; the hydrogen <b>removing</b> <b>efficiency</b> gets to the maximum after 8 minutes.

The specific objectives {{of this study were}} to: (i) determine which LULC types gained or lost most {{as a result of the}} observed LULCC; (ii) identify the major drivers of the LULCC/deforestation; and (iii) assess the approximate amount of carbon <b>stock</b> <b>removed</b> as a result of deforestation during the study period. Remote sensing and GIS were used to analyze LULCC. Landsat images acquired in 1985, 1995, 2005, and 2015 were used. Additionally, data from the Central Statistics Agency on cropland expansion, and human and livestock population growth were analyzed and correlations were made. The results showed that forest lost 123, 751 ha while farmland gained 292, 294 ha. Farmland and urban settlement expansion were found to be major drivers of LULCC. Aboveground carbon <b>stock</b> <b>removed</b> from forest and shrubland was more than 24 million tons. In the future, allocation of land to different uses must be based on appropriate land use policies.
