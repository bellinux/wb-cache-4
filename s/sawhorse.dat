5|$|On November 21, 1950, a {{westbound}} troop train, Passenger Extra 3538 West—consisting of the S-2-a class 2-8-2 {{steam locomotive}} 3538 and 17cars, {{about half of}} which had wood bodies with steel underframes—was travelling from Camp Shilo, Manitoba to Fort Lewis, Washington. It was carrying 23officers and 315men of 2nd Regiment, Royal Canadian Horse Artillery (RCHA) for deployment to the Korean War, a movement dubbed Operation <b>Sawhorse.</b> The train was moving through the Rocky Mountains on the CNR transcontinental mainline. CNR Train No.2, the eastbound Continental Limited, consisted of the U-1-a class 4-8-2 steam locomotive 6004 and eleven all-steel cars and was en route from Vancouver to Montreal.|$|E
25|$|Many {{characters}} in Oz are animated objects. Such figures as the Glass Cat, the Scarecrow, Jack Pumpkinhead, the <b>Sawhorse,</b> {{and others are}} common. Entire regions are the homes of such animated beings. The Dainty China Country is entirely filled with creatures made of china, who would freeze into figurines if removed. The China princess lives in fear of breaking, because {{she would never be}} as pretty even if repaired.|$|E
25|$|The {{restored}} Ozma {{is established}} {{on the throne}} after defeating Jinjur and her army. The Tin Woodman invites the Scarecrow to return {{with him to the}} Winkie Country along with Jack Pumpkinhead. The Gump is disassembled at his request (though his head was a hunting trophy that can still speak), Glinda returns to her palace in Quadling Country, the Woggle-bug remains as Ozma's advisor, and the <b>Sawhorse</b> becomes Ozma's personal steed. The forgotten prophecy is finally fulfilled and Oz is politically whole once more, with Ozma in her rightful position as the child Queen of Oz.|$|E

5000|$|Maetta's attendants {{bring in}} the prisoners, with Jinjur dressed as a milkmaid and Prissy wearing the checked skirt and a coat covered in medals. Maetta orders Athlos to cast Mombi into the dungeon, the latter spewing insults at the others as they drag her away. When Maetta takes away Jinjur for her punishment, Jack wishes that they all had <b>sawhorses,</b> and the Woggle-Bug works his magic, {{summoning}} six <b>sawhorses</b> for the number, [...] "The Equine Paradox" [...] (Tip, Woggle-Bug, Jack, Regent, Prissy, Professor).|$|R
25|$|The jackdaws {{return to}} their nest and attack the travelers, {{carrying}} off the Scarecrow's straw. Fortunately, the nest contains {{a large amount of}} paper money, with which the Scarecrow can be re-stuffed. Using Wishing Pills they discover in the container holding the Powder of Life, Tip and his friends escape and journey to the palace of Glinda the Good Witch in Oz's southern quadrant, the Quadling Country. They learn from Glinda that after the fall of Oz's mortal king Pastoria decades ago, a long lost princess named Ozma was hidden away in secrecy when the Wizard of Oz took the throne. She also informs them that Ozma is the rightful ruler of the Emerald City and all of Oz in general, not the Scarecrow (who did not really want the job anyway). Glinda therefore accompanies Tip, Jack, the <b>Sawhorse,</b> the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, the Wogglebug, and the Gump back to the Emerald City to see Mombi. The crooked woman tries to deceive them by disguising a chambermaid named Jellia Jamb as herself (which fails), but manages to elude them as they search for her in the Emerald City. Just as their time runs out, the Tin Woodman plucks a rose to wear in his lapel, unaware that this is the transformed Mombi.|$|E
500|$|The {{durability}} {{of the house}} was tested in the early 1940s, when a tornado struck the farmstead. [...] All of the farm's outbuildings were destroyed; but the house escaped undamaged, apart from a <b>sawhorse</b> blown through one of the windows.|$|E

5000|$|Born in 1876 in Church Hill, Mississippi, Errol Payne Palmer {{graduated}} from Barnes Medical College of St. Louis, Missouri, in 1898. He moved to Phoenix in 1900 setting up his first practice at 108 North Center Street, now Central Avenue. Dr. Palmer related {{in his personal}} papers [...] "I rode a bicycle for town calls and rented a horse and buggy from the livery stable for country calls." [...] When Dr. Palmer arrived in Phoenix, [...] "St. Joseph's Hospital had twelve beds and no operating room. A pair of carpenter <b>sawhorses</b> were placed in a patient's room and boards were put across the <b>sawhorses</b> to make an operating table. The part to be operated on was washed with warm water and soap, chloroform was the usual anesthetic and this was administered {{by some of the}} other surgeons." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{order to}} avoid being turned into a marble statue, Tip runs away with Jack that very same night and steals the Powder of Life. [...] He uses it to animate the wooden <b>Sawhorse</b> for Jack to ride. The <b>Sawhorse</b> runs so quickly that Tip is left behind. Walking alone, he meets General Jinjur's all-girl Army of Revolt, which is {{planning}} to overthrow the Scarecrow (who has ruled the Emerald City {{since the end of}} The Wonderful Wizard of Oz). Meanwhile, Jack and the <b>Sawhorse</b> arrive at the Emerald City and make the acquaintance of His Majesty the Scarecrow. Jinjur and her crew invade the Emerald city, terrorize the citizens, and loot the city, causing great havoc and chaos. Tip joins Jack and the Scarecrow in the palace, and they escape on the Sawhorse's back.|$|E
2500|$|In The Marvelous Land of Oz, the Powder of Life {{was used}} to bring Jack Pumpkinhead, the <b>Sawhorse,</b> and the Gump to life. [...] In The Patchwork Girl of Oz it brings the title {{character}} to life, also the glass cat and a phonograph.|$|E

Named Humor and inaugurated in 1970, it displays a man lifting a manhole cover in the pavement. The man is modelled after the actor and humorist Hans Alfredsson.

The entire sequence of collisions took at least 10 seconds.|$|R
60|$|Beside {{the stall}} of the <b>Sawhorse</b> {{had been placed}} another for Hank, the mule. This was not quite so {{beautiful}} as the other, for the <b>Sawhorse</b> was Ozma's favorite steed; but Hank had a supply of cushions for a bed (which the <b>Sawhorse</b> did not need because he never slept) and all this luxury was so strange to the little mule that he could only stand still and regard his surroundings and his queer companions with wonder and amazement.|$|E

"The <b>Sawhorse</b> is the {{favorite}} steed of Princess Ozma, the Ruler of the Land of Oz, and {{he lives in a}} stable decorated with pearls and emeralds, {{at the rear of the}} royal palace.

All the people of Oz respect the <b>Sawhorse</b> highly, and when I visit Ozma she sometimes allows me to ride him--as I am doing to-day.

60|$|There {{was an open}} wagon, {{with three}} seats for the passengers, and the wagon was drawn by the famous wooden <b>Sawhorse</b> which had once been brought to life by Ozma {{by means of a}} magic powder. The <b>Sawhorse</b> wore wooden shoes to keep his wooden legs from wearing away, and he was strong and swift. As this curious {{creature}} was Ozma's own favorite steed, and very popular with all the people of the Emerald City, Dorothy knew that she had been highly favored by being permitted to use the <b>Sawhorse</b> on her journey.|$|E
60|$|And, at {{the animal}} table, {{there was another}} {{interesting}} group, consisting of the Cowardly Lion, the Hungry Tiger, Toto--Dorothy's little shaggy black dog--Hank the Mule, the Pink Kitten, the Wooden <b>Sawhorse,</b> the Yellow Hen, and the Glass Cat.

60|$|This <b>Sawhorse,</b> while made of wood, {{was very}} much alive and could travel swiftly and without tiring.
