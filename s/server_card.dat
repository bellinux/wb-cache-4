40|$|The {{advancement}} of ICT {{in a variety}} of sectors helped in improving the time consuming and rigid service into fast and flexible service that is closer to the reach of individuals. For instance, mobile applications have evolved in different sectors such as healthcare patient support, geographic mapping and positioning, banking, e-commerce payment services and others. This study focuses {{on one of the most}} sensitive applications, which is mobile payment. Mobile payment system being one of the widely expanding mobile services, it has security concerns that prevented its wide acceptance. Some of the main security services given prior attention in mobile payment are issues of privacy, authentication and confidentiality. The research concentrates on the strong authentication of a mobile client to its server, securing the credit card* information and use of mobile card reader while making payments that enable customers to protect privacy of financial credentials. The strong authentication mechanism mainly follows the NIST standard publications namely, FIPS PUB 201 and FIPS 196; which are standards on Entity Authentication using public key cryptography and PKI credential storage Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card respectively. The proposed secure Credit Card Information (CCI) storage is in a secure element in order to prevent tampering of stored data. The secure element options are microSD, UICC, Smartcard (together with digital certificate and service ticket). During making payments, the payment information encrypted using a shared key is securely sent to payment server. A demo mobile application as proof of concept was implemented in a simulated lab (KTH SecLab), which has all the necessary infrastructure setup (<b>servers,</b> <b>card</b> reader) for testing the proposed solution. The paper was able to proof the concept of secure payment by enhancing the authentication, confidentiality and privacy of payment information.

40|$|Abstract. As the Internet {{grows in}} scale almost every year, {{security}} measures {{are expected to}} become {{all the more important}} on the Internet. A time-stamping authority (TSA) is a trusted authority which provides a proof that a datum existed before a particular time. In this research, we designed and implemented a RFC 3161 -compliant trusted time-stamping service (TTS) over the Internet. Software for the TTS server (TSA) was implemented on the Linux platform using Gnu’s C compiler while the TSA client software was implemented on the Windows platform using Borland’s C++Builder tool. Both TSA server and TTS client is equipped with an IC card reader and an off-theshelf smart card to strengthen security protection of TTS. For our TTS <b>server,</b> an IC <b>card</b> is used to store private key of the server. On the other hand, IC cards of TTS clients is used to provide user authentication during TTS request and provides TTS server protection against possible denial of service (DoS) attacks that might be deployed by opponents. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- Soft-products are {{intangible}} {{products that}} can be consumed without shipment, such as software, music and calling cards (calling time). The demand for soft-products on the Internet has been increasing {{for the past few}} years. At the same time, fraudulent credit card transactions have also increased. Compared to tangible products, fraudulent credit card transactions on soft-products are easier to conduct whilst difficult to recover. Fraudulent transactions are a major problem for e-commerce merchants, customers, and credit card issuers. The Trusted Email mechanism is new way to prevent fraudulent transactions on soft-products. Trusted Email is a custom email solution that can uniquely identify and authenticate the online customer, prevent unauthorized credit card transactions, and effectively resolve e-commerce disputes. In this paper we will study where the Trusted Email server should reside, who should handle it and why. In accordance with the best location of the Trusted Email <b>server,</b> Anonymous credit <b>card</b> transactions will be also studied in this paper and the new term “Selective Anonymity ” will be introduced...|$|R
50|$|In a {{brick and}} mortar casino, a house player does not subvert the {{fairness}} of the game being offered as long as the house is dealing honestly. In an online setting the same is also true. By definition, an honest online poker room that chooses to operate house bots would guarantee that the house bots did not have access to any information not also available to any other player in the hand (the same would apply to any human shill as well). The problem is that in an online setting the house has no way to prove their bots are not receiving sensitive information from the <b>card</b> <b>server.</b> This is further exacerbated by the ease with which clandestine information sharing can be accomplished in a digital environment. It is essentially impossible even for the house to prove that they do not control some players - probably the only real way that could be done would be to disclose the confidential personal information of every player and that obviously cannot be done due to privacy considerations.|$|R

50|$|Technology {{solutions}} {{can also}} completely prevent skimming (credit card fraud) by agents. At {{the point in}} the transaction where the agent needs to collect the credit card information, the call can be transferred to an Interactive Voice Response system. This protects the sensitive information, but can create an awkward customer interaction. Solutions such as agent-assisted automation allow the agent to capture the credit card information without ever seeing or hearing it. The agent remains on the phone and customers enter their credit card information directly into the customer relationship management software using the keypad of their phone. Agent-assisted automation can stumble however if callers read back the digits as they enter them. DTMF tones are suppressed entirely or converted to monotones so the agent cannot recognize them and so that they cannot be recorded. Some secure payment platforms allows for the masking of the DTMF tones, but are still recorded as DTMF tones by the on-site or hosted call recorders. Traditionally the only way to suppress DTMF tones is to intercept the call at the trunk using sophisticated <b>servers</b> and call <b>cards</b> to do so. This way allows for the suppression or masking of the DTMF tones to the call recorder, as well as the agent.|$|R
