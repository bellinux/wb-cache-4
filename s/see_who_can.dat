5|$|Minority Report also {{continues}} Spielberg's {{tradition of}} depicting broken families.*Vest. pg. 136 In Dick's short story, Anderton is a childless, married man whose main motives are self-preservation and preventing the disassembly of the PreCrime division. While {{he is also}} trying to save himself in the movie, his greater concern is uncovering the story behind his son's disappearance. Spielberg would later transform his next science fiction film, War of the Worlds, from a story about a single man to one about a divorced father concerned with protecting his children. Buckland notes that the two tragic parent-child relationships in the picture (Agatha and Ann Lively, John and Sean Anderton) have a common element. The movie has four shots of them submerged in water. Agatha's face is shown in a close up shot, taken from directly above her, when she is submerged in her photon milk, nutrient bath. When photos of her mother's submerged corpse are shown to her, the emphasized photograph is a similar image of her face taken from directly above. Anderton and his son are shown together in a pool flashback scene in which they have a contest to <b>see</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> hold their breath longest. John is underwater when his son is taken, and later in the apartment he is shown lying motionless, immersed in a filled bathtub, in a manner Buckland finds similar to the shots of Agatha and Ann. Buckland notes that co-screenwriter Frank introduced the water theme, as he wrote Agatha and her mother's back stories while adding the bathtub scene.|$|E

500|$|Gradually, {{beginning}} in the 19th century, sheep production in the U.S. moved westward. Today, {{the vast majority of}} flocks reside on Western range lands. During this westward migration of the industry, competition between sheep (sometime called [...] "range maggots") and cattle operations grew more heated, eventually erupting into range wars. Other than simple competition for grazing and water rights, cattlemen believed that the secretions of the foot glands of sheep made cattle unwilling to graze on places where sheep had stepped. As sheep production centered on the U.S. western ranges, it became associated with other parts of Western culture, such as the rodeo. In modern America, a minor event in rodeos is mutton busting, in which children compete to <b>see</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> stay atop a sheep the longest before falling off. Another effect of the westward movement of sheep flocks in North America was the decline of wild species such as Bighorn sheep (O. canadesis). Most diseases of domestic sheep are transmittable to wild ovines, and such diseases, along with overgrazing and habitat loss, are named as primary factors in the plummeting numbers of wild sheep. Sheep production peaked in North America during the 1940s and 1950s at more than 55 million head. By 2013 the number of sheep in the United States was 10 percent what {{it had been in the}} early 1940s.|$|E

500|$|The willie wagtail was {{a feature}} in Australian Aboriginal folklore. Aboriginal tribes {{in parts of}} southeastern Australia, such as the Ngarrindjeri of the Lower Murray River, and the Narrunga People of the Yorke Peninsula, regard the willie wagtail as the bearer of bad news. It was thought that the willie wagtail could steal a person's secrets while {{lingering}} around camps eavesdropping, so women would be tight-lipped {{in the presence of}} the bird. The people of the Kimberley held a similar belief that it would inform the spirit of the recently departed if living relatives spoke badly of them. They also venerated the willie wagtail as the most intelligent of all animals. Its cleverness is also seen in a Tinputz tale of Bougainville Island, where Singsing Tongereng (Willie Wagtail) wins a contest among all birds to <b>see</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> fly the highest, by riding on the back of the eagle. However, the Gunwinggu in western Arnhem Land took a dimmer view and regarded it as a liar and a [...] The willie wagtail was held to have stolen fire and tried to extinguish it in the sea in a dreaming story of the Yindjibarndi people of the central and western Pilbara, and was able to send a strong wind if frightened. In the Noongar language dialects, the willie wagtail is known as the Djiti-Djiti(pronounced Chitti-chitti) and the Willaring in the Perth region.|$|E

[...] Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly said that the song [...] "fully lives up to its title" [...] with [...] "every sound a hook," [...] and compared it to the works of Andrea True. Michael Hubbard from MusicOMH labelled the song [...] "one of 2001's best singles," [...] saying that it [...] "predictably beat off lesser 'competition.'"

[...] Billboards Jason Lipshutz felt that [...] "the metallic production wouldn't carry quite as much of its impact if Minogue had attempted to outshine it; wisely, her voice operates alongside it, finding renewed power in its drive", concluding that [...] "almost 15 years after its release, it still sounds fresh, forward-thinking and alive".|$|E
