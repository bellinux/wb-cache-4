50|$|The Cryptotermes brevis queen lays {{kidney-shaped}} {{eggs and}} these and the developing larvae are {{cared for by}} the pseudergates. After several moults they become pseudergates and assist {{in the work of}} the colony. At a later date, some pseudergates develop wing pads and become nymphs, which after three further moults grow into alates, reproductive termites with wings. Others go on to become presoldiers with white heads and, after another moult, soldiers with black heads. There are about fifty pseudergates for every soldier in the colony, and alates are only present in the nest at certain times of year. Alates emerge from the colony through temporary holes during the <b>swarming</b> <b>season.</b> In Florida, the dispersal flights take place at night from April to June. The alates are poor fliers and on landing, soon shed their wings. A male and female pair then searches for a suitable timber structure in which to found a new colony. They enter through a hole or crack, seal the entrance with an intestinal secretion and excavate a brood chamber. The first batch of eggs is cared for by the couple for several months but after the larvae have developed into pseudergates, the pair can concentrate on egg-laying. The first soldier does not appear until the second or third years and alates may develop around year five. A mature colony may contain over a thousand termites and survive for upward of ten years.|$|E

40|$|A {{detailed}} study of {{various aspects of the}} biology of Bifiditermes beesont (Gardner) was carried out under laboratory conditions and in nature at Lahore during 1973 â€“ 79. The population dynamics of different castes in the natural colonies during different parts of the year was studied and correlated with the climatic conditions. A change in the meteorological conditions changes the behaviour of the colony with respect to the egg-laying and hatching, development of nymphs and caste differentiation and the production of alates and their exodus for swarming. During <b>swarming</b> <b>season,</b> temperature of one the laboratory colonies and its adjacent air was recorded about half-an-hour before expected time of swarming to find out if with the approach of swarming, there is any increases of temperature inside the colony. It was found that the temperature inside the colony rose by 2 oc when swarming was about to begin. The weather conditions determining the <b>swarming</b> <b>season</b> of B. beesoni at Lahore were studied during 1973 â€“ 77. The critical meteorological conditions which initiate or prevent the swarming of B. beesoni have been evaluated.

40|$|Wind velocity, light intensity, soil temperature, vapor {{pressure}} {{deficit in the}} colony, {{vapor pressure}} deficit at {{the surface of the}} flight slits, and vapor pressure deficit at 1 m above the soil were measured during the <b>swarming</b> <b>season.</b> The vapor pressure deficits and soil temperature were not critical factors for flight since they were in a favorable range during the observation period. Light intensity had to drop to 10. 8 lumen/m 2 before flight was initiated. Flight was terminated when the light was reduced to 0. 14 lumen/m 2. Light intensity, however, was not limiting since the intensity dropped every evening. The key microenvironmental factor regulating flight was the wind velocity at the flight slits. Flight was initiated if the wind velocity was below 3. 7 km/h. If the wind increased to over 3. 7 km/h after flight was started, flight was terminated...|$|E
30|$|The wood {{specimens}} {{were selected}} based on the feeding responses of I. minor to 10 commercial timbers as reported by Indrayani et al. [15]. Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis Bong.

Evaluation of the initial nest-founding activity of I. minor in a natural context was carried out at four infested houses in Wakayama Prefecture, Japan. Fifteen pieces of Spruce timbers were laid with gaps of ~ 10  mm between them in the highly infested attic area at each house. The timbers were laid in random positions, without considering whether tangential sections, radial sections, sapwood parts, and heartwood parts were oriented in any particular direction.

40|$|International audienceIn a {{honey bee}} {{population}} of 150 colonies, {{the development of}} an introduced Varroa destructor mite population was monitored in swarming and non-swarming colonies for two years in a Nordic climate. The results demonstrated a reduced mite population as a result of swarming only for the first <b>swarm</b> <b>season</b> studied. In the second <b>swarm</b> <b>season,</b> there were much higher mite levels (based on debris counts of mites) and fewer colonies swarmed, but {{there was no significant difference}} in infestation levels of adult bees in the fall between swarming and non-swarming colonies. This result was interpreted as an effect of host-parasite interactions, where the detrimental influence from the infestation prohibited growth (and swarming) in some colonies, but allowed better mite reproduction opportunities (and swarming) in others. Surprisingly, the mite infestation levels of swarms in the late fall were not significantly different from those of swarming colonies the same year, indicating that swarm survival may be almost as much affected by V. destructor, as intact, swarming colonies. No horizontal mite transfer through robbing was observed. The results suggest that, horizontal mite transfer may not be as important in a Nordic climate where many bee colonies die over winter along with their mites, as it is in warmer climates...|$|R
40|$|A general {{aspect of}} the daytime surface {{swarming}} of Euphausia pacifica in Japanese nearshore waters is described {{in connection with the}} water temperature. Swarming usually starts with a local minimum temperature around 7 °C and terminates with a temperature just below 16 °C. The <b>swarming</b> <b>season</b> is essentially in spring, from February through May, with little difference among regions. The main swarming areas are on the Pacific coast around Kinkazan, and on the coast of the Sea of Japan around Sadogashima, in Wakasawan and its vicinity, around Oki, and {{on the east side of}} the Tsushima Gunto. It is shown that the swarming is closely related to cold water masses, and that the approach of offshore cold water masses to the nearshore areas and the mixing process in the coastal areas may provide favorable conditions for swarming. Swarming of E. pacifica is a phenomenon that occurs at the margins of the cold water bodies, and is related to the seasonal change in the geographical distribution of those euphausiids. A uniformly low water temperature profile must be the necessary condition for swarming, but other possible factors stimulating euphausiids to swarm are enumerated...|$|E
40|$|Functional wing {{polymorphism}} {{is commonly}} observed it) insects, {{and it may}} confer an important adaptive value to populations that bear this trait, because it allows dispersal and the location to more favorable habitats for their survival and reproduction. According to the oogenesis-flight syndrome theory, such wing polymorphism may imply differences in the locomotion Capacity of individuals, which is a factor induced by adverse environmental conditions during muscle development in immatures. Scaptocoris carvalhoi Becker (Hemiptera: Cydnidae) is an important agriculture pest in Brazil, and it has burrowing habits. The adults swarm {{in the beginning of}} the rainy season after a prolonged drought period in the Brazilian cerrado region. In these swarms, part of the population leaves the soil, performing long flights until locations with more abundant vegetation. In this study, we characterized wing polymorphism in S. carvalhoi, this being the first description in a species of Cydnidae. Brachypterous and macropterous males and females were observed, which showed positive and significant correlations between body length and hindwing length. Macropterous individuals demonstrated greater locomotion capacity than brachypterous individuals. In addition, only long-winged adults could fly, showing wing mobility and flight reaction. The increased number of macropterous individuals inside the soil during the <b>swarming</b> <b>season</b> and {{in the beginning of the}} rainy period suggests that wing polymorphism in this population occurs in seasonal cycles and that factors related to the scarcity of rains influence the development of immatures and the formation of polymorphic adults...|$|E

30|$|Although {{it is an}} {{economically}} important pest, {{there is very little}} scientific literature on the initial establishment of I. minor nest-gallery systems. The most detailed description of I. minor biology was provided by Harvey [11], eight decades ago. The cryptic behavior of I. minor hinders the study of nest-gallery establishment and of the invasiveness of the colony; thus, early detection of I. minor infestation is difficult. Naturally, new colony dissemination is facilitated by swarming activities in the dispersal flight <b>season.</b> <b>Swarming</b> occurs during the summer to the fall on bright, sunny days which attract alates to emerge from the colonies (positive phototaxis) [10 – 13].|$|R
50|$|The annual colony {{cycle of}} honeybees {{involves}} migration, swarming, and ing. A. florea migrate seasonally from one habitat to another. This might increase colony fitness, as the honeybees {{search for new}} territories, resources, or a reduction in parasites. Once a colony has outgrown its hive space, it will reproduce via <b>swarming.</b> During warmer <b>seasons</b> like spring and summer, ambient temperatures allow honeybees to forage actively, and they will reproduce frequently. During the colder seasons of autumn and winter, colonies diminish in size because they depend on food stores. Before swarming, the colony will build queen cells in order for virgin queens to rear young queens. Before the new queens emerge, the colony’s workers {{search for a new}} nesting site. Afterwards, the bees will choose who stays and who goes. Similar to ing behavior, the old queen will swarm while the new queens prepare for emergence.|$|R
40|$|Workers in many eusocial insect species show {{considerable}} size variation {{within a}} colony. Honeybees (Apis mellifera) vary little in size {{compared to other}} eusocial bee species, but there is evidence for a link between worker size and behaviour. In this study, we investigated how size variation and the average size of honeybee foragers change during a foraging season. We also tested the influence of colony weight and swarming on worker size. Finally, by analysing waggle dances, we tested if forager size is linked to foraging distance, between and within colonies. We found {{that the size of}} foragers significantly increases over the foraging <b>season.</b> <b>Swarming</b> did not appear to affect worker size, but colony size was overall positively linked to wing length and leg width. However, we did not find a relationship between foraging distance and forager size. We discuss how the constant size of brood cells and an efficient communication between foragers could lead to a narrower size range...|$|R
40|$|During autumn in the {{temperate}} zone of {{both the}} new and old world, bats of many species assemble at underground sites in a behaviour known as swarming. Autumn swarming behaviour is thought to primarily serve as a promiscuous mating system, but may also {{be related to the}} localization and assessment of hibernacula. Bats subsequently make use of the same underground sites during winter hibernation, however it is currently unknown if the assemblages that make use of a site are comparable across swarming and hibernation sea-sons. Our purpose was to characterize the bat assemblages found at five underground sites during both the swarming and the hibernation season and compare the assemblages found during the two seasons both across sites and within species. We found that the rela-tive abundance of individual species per site, as well as the relative proportion of a species that makes use of each site, were both significantly correlated between the <b>swarming</b> and hibernation <b>seasons.</b> These results suggest that swarming may indeed {{play a role in the}} localization of suitable hibernation sites.

50|$|In preusurpation V. austriaca individuals, Dufour’s gland {{contains}} clear oil material. It {{is part of}} {{the reproductive}} organs along with the ovaries and a poison gland. Distinctly enough, in new fall parasites, the Dufour’s gland was empty and flat and in older parasites, the gland had a little oil but flatten as well. Hypertrophy of the Dufour’s gland is known to occur but more evidence is needed. During and after the mauling period, female Vespula austriaca wasps will oviposit. This time period is brief. The females insert eggs in new cell combs. Workers act no differently during period of oviposition. However, one instance of a worker interrupting the oviposition of the parasite was recorded, which led to mauling of the worker by the parasite and the egg falling out of the designated cell. Eggs laid by Vespula austriaca females are not only found in cells but also found on the cell wall, exterior of the comb, between two cells, or along the caps. As mentioned before, the Vespula austriaca species do not produce any workers. Instead the queens lay eggs that eventually produce more queens and male adults. Normally in wasps, males move in <b>swarms</b> during mating <b>season.</b> A male Vespula austriaca male was seen hovering over a fig tree in Ireland.|$|R
40|$|The swarm {{structure}} of two sibling species, Anopheles gambiae coluzzii and Anopheles melas, was characterize {{to explore the}} ecological and environmental parameters associated {{with the formation of}} swarms and their spatial distribution. Swarms and breeding sites were searched and sampled between January and December 2010, and larval and adult samples were identified by PCR. During the dry <b>season,</b> 456 <b>swarms</b> of An. gambiae s. l. were sampled from 38 swarm sites yielding a total of 23, 274 males and 76 females. Of these 38 swarming sites, 18 were composed exclusively of An. gambiae coluzzii and 20 exclusively of An. melas, presenting clear evidence of reproductive swarm segregation. The species makeup of couples sampled from swarms also demonstrated assortative mating. The swarm site localization was close to human dwellings {{in the case of the}} An. gambiae coluzzii and on salt production sites for An. melas. At the peak of the rainy <b>season,</b> <b>swarms</b> of An. melas were absent. These findings offer evidence that the ecological speciation of these two sibling species of mosquitoes is associated with spatial swarm segregation and assortative mating, providing strong support for the hypothesis that mate recognition is currently maintaining adaptive differentiation and promoting ecological speciation.

40|$|International audience: The {{swarming}} behaviour {{of natural}} populations of Anopheles arabiensis was investigated by conducting transect surveys on 10 consecutive days, around dusk, from March to April and from September to October 2012 in Dioulassoba, a district of Bobo-Dioulasso city in Burkina Faso (West Africa). Swarms were observed outside, around identified larval breeding {{sites on the}} banks of the Houet River, as well as in the open-air courtyards found at the centre of many homes in the region. Swarms were found to occur in open sunlit spaces, mostly located above physical or visual cues somehow visually distinct from the surrounding area. Overall 67 and 78 swarms were observed, respectively, during the dry season (March-April) and the rainy season (September-October) of 2012, between 1. 5 and 4. 5 m above the ground at the centre. 964 mosquitoes were collected and analysed from dry <b>season</b> <b>swarms,</b> of which most were male, and all were An. arabiensis, as were the few resting mosquitoes collected indoors. Larvae collected from breeding sites found {{on the banks of}} the Houet River mostly consisted of An. arabiensis and only a minority of Anopheles coluzzii (formerly identified as An. gambiae M form). Of 1694 mosquitoes analysed from 78 swarms in the rainy season collections, a few An. gambiae (formerly known as An. gambiae S form) males were identified, and the remainders were An. arabiensis. The majority of larvae collected during the wet season from the same breeding sites were identified as An. arabiensis followed by An. coluzzii and An. gambiae. The same pattern of species composition was observed in resting mosquitoes, though the proportion of An. arabiensis was less overwhelming. These data support the conclusion that An. arabiensis is the most prevalent species in this area, though the difference in species composition when using different population sampling techniques is noteworthy. Further studies are required for more detailed investigations of male dispersal, feeding behaviour and mating patterns in this urban setting...|$|R
