5|$|Zinc {{burns in}} {{air with a}} bright bluish-green flame, giving off fumes of zinc oxide. Zinc reacts readily with acids, alkalis and other non-metals. Extremely pure zinc reacts only <b>slowly</b> <b>at</b> room {{temperature}} with acids. Strong acids, such as hydrochloric or sulfuric acid, can remove the passivating layer and subsequent reaction with water releases hydrogen gas.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, six {{aircraft}} without engines were {{fitted with}} Mikulin AM-35A engines, while VVS officials evaluated both the Charomskiy ACh-30 and Charomskiy M-40 aircraft Diesel engines. At least nine Pe-8s were fitted with Diesel engines in 1941, {{but neither the}} ACh-30 nor the M-40 were entirely satisfactory, despite greatly increasing {{the range of the}} aircraft. All surviving Pe-8s were re-engined with AM-35As by the end of 1941. Production continued <b>slowly</b> <b>at</b> Factory No. 124; most of the factory's resources were devoted to the higher-priority Petlyakov Pe-2, a successful light bomber. At this time, most of these aircraft, re-designated as the Pe-8 after Petlyakov was killed in a Pe-2 crash on 12 January 1942, were built with out-of-production AM-35A engines.|$|E

5|$|Ocean tides are {{converted}} to heat by frictional {{losses in the}} oceans and their interaction with the solid bottom and with the top ice crust. In late 2008, it was suggested Jupiter may keep Europa's oceans warm by generating large planetary tidal waves on Europa because of its small but non-zero obliquity. This generates so-called Rossby waves that travel quite <b>slowly,</b> <b>at</b> just a few kilometers per day, but can generate significant kinetic energy. For the current axial tilt estimate of 0.1 degree, the resonance from Rossby waves would contain 7.3 J of kinetic energy, which is two thousand times larger {{than that of the}} flow excited by the dominant tidal forces. Dissipation of this energy could be the principal heat source of Europa's ocean.|$|E
5|$|Other organothorium {{compounds}} are not well-studied. Tetrabenzylthorium, Th(CH2C6H5), and tetraallylthorium, Th(C3H5)4, are known, {{but their}} structures {{have not been}} determined and they decompose <b>slowly</b> <b>at</b> room temperature. Thorium forms the monocapped trigonal prismatic anion 3−, heptamethylthorate, which forms the salt 3 (tmeda = Me2NCH2CH2NMe2). Although one methyl group is only attached to the thorium atom (Th–C distance 257.1pm) and the other six connect the lithium and thorium atoms (Th–C distances 265.5–276.5pm) they behave equivalently in solution. Tetramethylthorium, Th(CH3)4, is not known, but its adducts are stabilised by phosphine ligands.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of seven seasons, Neuner has reached 34 {{personal}} World Cup wins. In {{the history of the}} International Biathlon Union she is ranked second behind Magdalena Forsberg (42), with Uschi Disl (30) third, for all-time career victories. In addition, she has won nine relay races and three mixed relay events as part of the German World Cup team. Neuner has often started <b>slowly</b> <b>at</b> the beginning of a winter season and has claimed only three of her individual victories before Christmas. Consequently, 18 of her 47 wins came in the month of March. Geographically most of her wins occurred in Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia (10), followed by Antholz, Italy (6) and Ruhpolding, Germany (6).|$|E

5|$|The article {{explains}} {{the sequence of}} events of this August 4 New York City demonstration flight of 1895. When the reporter was all positioned and ready in the sky-cycle he gave word to the ground crew {{to let go of the}} ropes that held the hydrogen balloon back and it immediately lifted the sky-cycle into the air. The airship drifted up <b>slowly</b> <b>at</b> first, going towards the factory roof peaks. The driver-reporter immediately dropped one of the sandbag weights and the sky-cycle airship rose up sharply, avoiding the building roofs. When the airship was about a thousand feet high the attached balloon propeller revolved and the sky-cycle airship flew over the East River. The steamships and tugs that spotted the sky-cycle floating above tooted their whistles.|$|E
5|$|Word of the Gold Rush spread <b>slowly</b> <b>at</b> first. The {{earliest}} gold-seekers {{were people}} who lived near California or people who heard the news from ships on the fastest sailing routes from California. The first large group of Americans to arrive were several thousand Oregonians who came down the Siskiyou Trail. Next came people from the Sandwich Islands, and several thousand Latin Americans, including people from Mexico, from Peru and {{from as far away}} as Chile, both by ship and overland. By the end of 1848, some 6,000 Argonauts had come to California.|$|E
5|$|In 1874–75, {{after labor}} unrest {{disrupted}} coal production, the Union Pacific Coal Department hired Chinese laborers {{to work in}} their coal mines throughout southern Wyoming. Even so, the Chinese population rose <b>slowly</b> <b>at</b> first; however, where there were Chinese immigrants, they were generally concentrated in one area. At Red Desert, a remote section camp in Sweetwater County, there were 20 inhabitants, of whom 12 were Chinese. All 12 were laborers who worked under an American foreman. To the east of Red Desert was another remote section camp, Washakie. An American section foreman lived there amongst 23 others, including 13 Chinese laborers and an Irish crew foreman. In the various section camps along the main line of the Union Pacific Railroad, Chinese workers far outnumbered any other nationality. Though the 79 Chinese in Sweetwater County in 1870 represented only 4% of the total population, they were, again, concentrated. In Rock Springs and Green River, the largest towns along the UP line, there were no Chinese residents reported in 1870.|$|E

5|$|Noé {{first tried}} to get the film funded in the early 2000s. Several {{producers}} responded positively to the script, and it was briefly under development for Tom Tykwer's German company X-Filme Creative Pool. It was considered too expensive and the producers dropped out. Prospects changed when Irréversible (2002) became a commercial success. Noé had written and directed Irréversible for StudioCanal, and it was sold internationally by their subsidiary, Wild Bunch. When the producers at Wild Bunch asked Noé {{what he wanted to do}} next, he answered Enter the Void. The project was once again considered too expensive in relation to its commercial potential, but when Wild Bunch discovered that Noé had started to develop the film for Pathé instead of them, they said that they were willing to fund it. Since development went <b>slowly</b> <b>at</b> Pathé, Noé chose to not renew his contract with the studio and accepted Wild Bunch's offer.|$|E
5|$|The {{prototype}} E850 named Lord Nelson {{was ordered}} from Eastleigh railway works in June 1925 but production proceeded <b>slowly,</b> <b>at</b> Maunsell’s insistence, {{to ensure that}} the weight was kept to a minimum at every stage, so the locomotive did not appear until August 1926. It was tested on a variety of duties over the next year, with sufficiently encouraging results for an initial order for ten more locomotives for delivery between May 1928 and April 1929 to be placed. These were originally scheduled to be allocated to Battersea depot and fitted with 4,000 gallon 6-wheeled tenders suitable for the Continental ports. However, during construction, it was decided to equip half of the class with 5,000 gallon 8-wheeled tenders necessary for the longer West of England routes and to allocate them to Nine Elms depot. A further batch of ten locomotives was ordered in 1928, before the previous batch had been delivered, but when it became apparent that the Stock Market Crash of 1929 would be likely to reduce the demand for Continental travel, this second order was reduced to five.|$|E
