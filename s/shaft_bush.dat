50|$|Some owners {{realised}} {{that the}} long stroke 2.5-litre engine fitted to the TR5/6 and 2.5PI had the same dimensions as the 2-litre engine, and could be fitted to the Vitesse simply by swapping the rear engine plate, input <b>shaft</b> <b>bush,</b> and clutch, then bolting on Vitesse engine mounts. In fact it was practical (and virtually undetectable!) to strip the Vitesse Mk2 engine and rebuild with 2.5 crankshaft, pistons, and cylinder head to achieve this capacity increase. Some repowered 2.5-litre cars were fitted with the original Stromberg CD150s, some with Webers or Dellortos, and some even kept the problematic but effective mechanical Lucas petrol injection system. Unfortunately the Vitesse gearbox and diff were not really up to a 150 hp 2.5 litre engine's output. Fitting the gearbox from the 2.5 was {{not as simple as}} the engine so this remained a problem for most with the 2.5.|$|E

The main influencing factor is that the verticality of the interior hole is Ultra-poor in the Process quality deficiencies. A series of the testing data of this deficiency indicator has been analyzed {{in order to obtain}} the factors influencing the deficiency indicator. Finally, comparison is made between the quality status before and after implementing improvement measures and measures of adjusting processes are taken to greatly improve the effect and the product qualified rate, which can provide reference for enterprises to improve the quality in the production process...|$|E
40|$|Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) {{researchers}} are investigating {{and developing a}} rotary microfilter for solid-liquid separation applications at the Savannah River Site (SRS). Because {{of the success of}} that work, the Hanford Site is evaluating the use of the rotary microfilter for its Supplemental Pretreatment process. The authors performed rotary filter testing with a full-scale, 25 -disk unit with 0. 5 {micro} filter media manufactured by Pall Corporation using a Hanford AN- 105 simulant at solids loadings of 0. 06, 0. 29, and 1. 29 wt%. The conclusions from this testing are: (1) The filter flux at 0. 06 wt% solids reached a near constant value at an average of 0. 26 gpm/ft{sup 2 } (6. 25 gpm total). (2) The filter flux at 0. 29 wt% solids reached a near constant value at an average of 0. 17 gpm/ft{sup 2 } (4 gpm total). (3) The filter flux at 1. 29 wt% solids reached a near constant value at an average of 0. 10 gpm/ft{sup 2 } (2. 4 gpm total). (4) Because of differences in solids loadings, a direct comparison between crossflow filter flux and rotary filter flux is not possible. The data show the rotary filter produces a higher flux than the crossflow filter, but the improvement is not as large as seen in previous testing. (5) Filtrate turbidity measured < 4 NTU in all samples collected. (6) During production, the filter should be rinsed with filtrate or dilute caustic and drained prior to an extended shutdown to prevent the formation of a layer of settled solids on top of the filter disks. (7) Inspection of the seal faces after {approx} 140 hours of operation showed an expected amount of initial wear, no passing of process fluid through the seal faces, and very little change in the air channeling grooves on the stationary face. (8) Some polishing was observed {{at the bottom of the}} <b>shaft</b> <b>bushing.</b> The authors recommend improving the <b>shaft</b> <b>bushing</b> by holding it in place with a locking ring and incorporated grooves to provide additional cooling.

40|$|The new {{emission}} legislations, demand, from vehicle manufactures, {{the development}} of technologies to improve fuel consumption and pollutants emission. Following this trend, the turbocharging systems innovate together and release new turbocharger architectures in the market. One {{of them is the}} regulated-two-stages Turbocharger, which delivers higher efficiency in a broader engine speed range. In this system, there are two turbochargers, the High and Low Pressure stages. The former has a bigger influence on the low engine speeds, and the latter in the higher engine speed. Between both stages there is a ByPass valve that allows the gas flow to reach the Low Pressure stage, when needed. In this paper, a wear analysis to understand the wear rate between <b>shaft</b> and <b>bushing</b> of the Bypass valve is presented. This study started in two fronts, the first one is on the wear measurements of high mileage components. Using a precise tridimensional equipment, <b>shaft</b> and <b>bushing</b> had their diameters measured along the whole length over 20. 000 points. This data was the input to study the wear profile, depth and shape. As well as predict contact area and total wear volume. The second front is based on measurements of forces and displacements acting on the pair shaft-bushing. These measurements were performed on real vehicle running a representative application where wear was detected. The dynamic interaction between these forces and the <b>shaft</b> and <b>bushing</b> was essential to explain the wear behavior and understand the influence of each force component. All this experimental data was used as input to the wear equation, developed from wear theory and can be used to evaluate impact of new designs...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of oil whirl and oil whip in fluid film radial {{bearings}} due to possible metallic contact. The degree of metallic contact and thereby wear and tear between rotating <b>shafts</b> and bearing <b>bushes</b> is assessed by measuring electric currents through the oil film. The current {{as well as the}} voltage varied in accordance with the contact ratio between the <b>shaft</b> and <b>bush</b> in the fluid film radial bearing. The gauge signal thus indicates the degree of metallic contact based on the thickness of the oil film in the load zone. Some experimental results are provided to illustrate that at low normalised loads involving oil whirl and oil whip, no electric current is detected, while high levels of electric current are registered at high load levels when no oil whirl or oil whip occurred. It is therefore concluded that at low loads, oil whirl and oil whip have little influence on wear and tear in a journal bearing. © 2014 Springer-Verlag London...|$|R
50|$|Hydrodynamic {{bearings}} require greater care {{in design}} and operation than hydrostatic bearings. They are also more prone to initial wear because lubrication does not occur until there is rotation of the shaft. At low rotational speeds the lubrication may not attain complete separation between <b>shaft</b> and <b>bushing.</b> As a result, hydrodynamic bearings may be aided by secondary bearings that support the shaft during start and stop periods, protecting the fine tolerance machined surfaces of the journal bearing. On the other hand, hydrodynamic bearings are simpler to install and are less expensive.|$|R

All of components are related to each other, if components are not installed with precision, the machine rejected. Manufacturing of the crank case begins with the die casting process, face milling, drilling, boring, reaming, spot facing and tapping. The most important process is the face milling. Face milling is done {{on both sides of the}} crank case R & L, which will both be united. Therefore, it takes surface roughness 12. 5 μm, flat and level, because if there are scratches on the crank case surface after combined oil seepage will occur. It is already a reject. It required an analysis of the failure of face milling process by considering several things, namely machining parameters are used, the condition of the cutting tool,the installation of the crank case on the jig and the coolant used. Analyzing the four factors above, it is hoped will be able to optimize the face milling process as well as reduced product reject. ...|$|R

When {{it comes to a}} vehicle with the problem of low-frequency noise, finite element models of substructures for vehicle body and chassis are established, respectively. In addition, substructure power flow method is also employed to examine the transfer characteristics of multidimensional vibration energy for the whole vehicle system.

40|$|Analysis {{of known}} studies {{has shown that}} {{existing}} approaches required solution of complex systems of integral-differential equations or cumbersome numerical methods that are unacceptable in the engineering practice. As a result, {{a model of the}} sliding bearing wear in conditions of boundary friction was obtained in a form of dependence of the wear rate on the dimensionless complexes of contact pressure and sliding velocity. On the basis of the proposed wear model, the wear-contact problem for a cylindrical sliding bearing was solved. The equation of equilibrium for medium pressures and the approximating function of linear wear from the arc of contact between the <b>shaft</b> and the <b>bushing</b> were used as the determining equations. The solution was obtained in a closed form as a dependence of wear degree on the friction path. To identify parameters of wear resistance in the wear model, a calculation-experimental method for determining calculated dependences of wear resistance parameters was developed {{on the basis of the}} wear test by the "cone - three balls" scheme. It has shown that the calculated wear values were consistent with the operational data on wear of sliding bearings.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the design and {{analysis}} of air bearing suitable for high speed micro gas turbine. Design {{has been carried out}} for a turbine rotor having symmetrical loading by mathematical modeling and numerical simulation of its dynamic motion. The rigid symmetrical rotor is supported in two air bearings and each bearing is of radial configuration with a cylindrical bush. The input parameters from the micro gas turbine design have been considered for the design of bearing to suit the rotor system. For the established shaft configuration, non-linear Reynolds equation is solved to get the air pressure distribution in the gap between the <b>shaft</b> and the <b>bush.</b> The load capacity of the bearing is calculated by integrating the pressure distribution obtained earlier. The displacements, velocities and dynamic components of load capacity with time are used to evaluate the damping and stiffness coefficients of air film between the journal and the bush. A non-linear equation of motion of the shaft is evolved using the above coefficients. The stability threshold is estimated from the linearized equations of motion. The stability threshold estimation leads to arrival of stability boundaries of rotor bearing system characterized by the required stiffness and damping coefficients of the bush support surrounding the air bearing. The required stiffness and damping coefficients of bush are achieved by providing an air ring around the bush. The complete mathematical procedure has been coded using MATLAB Software...|$|R
40|$|It {{is often}} assumed that a twin groove {{arrangement}} {{will provide a}} more effective lubrication and a cooler operation than a single groove one, but little evidence {{has been found in}} support of this claim. Furthermore, there are no experimental works, to the authors’ knowledge, that compare the performance of single and twin axial groove bearings with the same geometry. An experimental assessment of a journal bearing with either two axial grooves located at +/- 90 º or just one single groove at + 90 º to the load line was performed. The comparison was made by using the same bearing for both groove configurations but the oil feeding to the - 90 º groove was shut with a valve in one of the cases in order to emulate a single groove bearing. Measurements of total and partial lubricant flow rate through each groove, <b>shaft</b> locus, inner <b>bush</b> surface temperature, oil outlet temperature and electrical motor consumption were performed. For the range of applied loads tested the twin groove journal bearing displayed a lower maximum temperature but a higher outlet temperature and eccentricity than the single groove journal bearing. Also the measured total flow rate in the bearing was approximately the same for the single and the twin groove arrangements. For the twin groove bearing, the partial flow rate through each groove varied dramatically with increasing load: At high eccentricities the flow being supplied to the active land of the bearing through the + 90 º groove was much lower than that supplied to the non-active land of the bearing through the - 90 º groove. Actually, the measured flow rate at the + 90 º groove was almost zero for the highest load tested, with nearly all the lubricant being fed to the non-active land of the bearing through the - 90 º groove. This means that under heavy load operation, the existence of an extra groove at - 90 º to the load line might actually deteriorate lubrication effectiveness when compared with a single groove arrangement...|$|R
