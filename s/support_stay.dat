40|$|Abstract. Exergames {{encourage}} physical activity, {{but generally}} require specialized hardware and prescribed activities; whereas pervasive accumulated context exergames (PACEs) allow players {{to choose their}} type of exercise, but have limited depth of play. For mass commercialization of PACEs, facilitating long-term behavioural change, we propose two requirements: that PACEs support large-scale and flexible deployment; and that the design of PACEs <b>support</b> <b>staying</b> power through long-term playability. From these requirements, we motivate six PACE design principles and use these principles to develop a multiplayer roleplaying PACE. Results from a week-long study of our game showed that by satisfying the six design principles, we can create a PACE with scalability and staying power. Our results are {{the first step toward}} creating PACEs that promotes long-term game engagement, which is needed for activity-related behaviour change...|$|R

50|$|During Israel's early years, he objected his party’s {{coalition}} {{membership and}} was {{an outspoken critic of}} the government’s western orientation, the nationality conception, the Reparations Agreement and the martial law. At first, he supported the Soviet Union and tried, along with Moshe Sneh, to introduce Hashomer Hatzair’s idea in Mapam. The exposure of Stalin's wrongdoings caused a schism in the Marxist orientation, resulting in the expulsion of Moshe Sneh's men from the party in 1953. Gradually, admiration of the Soviet Union lessened and inclination to cooperate with Mapai increased, and in 1955 Mapam indeed joined Mapai in the coalition. After the Six-Day War he expressed a relatively hawkish stand by opposing immediate withdrawal from the occupied territories. In 1969 he supported Mapam's alliance with Mapai as part of the Alignment (In 1984, he would <b>support</b> <b>staying</b> in the Alignment until the formation of the national unity government in 1984).|$|R
40|$|In {{qualitative}} research {{we are often}} presented with a tension between having open and fluid interviews to <b>support</b> <b>staying</b> true to the lived experiences of participants and achieving a level of abstraction from the data in order to uncover the essential structures and meanings of that particular lived experience. A way of resolving this tension is {{through the application of}} theoretical frameworks. Van Manen’s four lifeworld existentials offer a lens through which to explore and navigate disparate interview data and uncover the essences of lived experience, without imposing categories upon the data itself. Drawing on a study exploring the lived experiences of childless women, we explore the process and principles in operationalising the existentials and discuss the potential implications for analysis and findings. The article demonstrates how Van Manen’s lifeworld existentials present us with a holistic and valuable method for reflective practice, in coming to understand lived experience...|$|R
