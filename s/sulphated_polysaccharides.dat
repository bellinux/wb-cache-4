30|$|The {{intraperitoneal}} {{administration of}} acetaminophen caused marked hepatic necrosis with fatty changes, infiltration of polymorphonuclear cells, abnormal central vein and sinusoidal morphological pattern. Crude <b>sulphated</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> from S. swartzii (EW 1 fraction) showed considerable reduction in pathological changes that produced after acetaminophen administration. The <b>sulphated</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> from S. swartzii extracted {{at room temperature}} (EW 1 fraction) prevented hepatic necrosis similar to the rats pretreated with silymarin (35 [*]mg/kg) in acetaminophen-intoxicated rats. Raghavendran & Srinivasan [17], reported {{that a number of}} necrotic cells were depleted in rats co-treated with <b>sulphated</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> and acetaminophen. This might be due to the presence of high sulfate content in seaweed polysaccharides, which inhibit oxidative stress [44]. Ross et al.

The <b>sulphated</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> from Sargassum wightii showed considerable reduction in the pathological changes produced after cyclosporine A-induced liver injury animals [32].

40|$|Abstract Background Seaweeds or marine algae {{have long}} been made up {{a key part of}} the Asian diet, and as an antioxidant, <b>sulphated</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> have piqued the {{interest}} of many researchers as one of the ocean's greatest treasures. The present investigation suggests the therapeutic potential of <b>sulphated</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> from marine brown algae " Sargassum wightii " in Cyclosporine A (CsA) - induced liver injury. CsA is a potent immunosuppressive agent used in the field of organ transplantations and various autoimmune disorders. However, hepatotoxicity due to CsA remains to be one of the major clinical challenges. Methods The effect of <b>sulphated</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> on CsA-induced hepatotoxicity was studied in adult male albino rats of Wistar strain, and the animals were randomized into four groups with six rats in each. Group I served as vehicle control. Group II rats were given CsA at a dosage of 25 mg/kg body weight, orally for 21 days. Group III rats were given <b>sulphated</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> at a dosage of 5 mg/kg body weight, subcutaneously for 21 days. Group IV rats were given <b>sulphated</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> simultaneously along with CsA, as mentioned in Group II for 21 days. Results CsA provoked hepatotoxicity was evident from the decreased activities of hepatic marker enzymes. A significant rise in the level of oxidants, along with a striking decline in both the enzymic and non-enzymic antioxidants, marks the severity of oxidative stress in CsA-induced rats. This in turn led to enhanced levels of lipid peroxidation, 8 -hydroxy- 2 -deoxy guanosine and protein carbonyls, along with a decrease in ATPase activities and alterations in lipid profile. Histopathological changes also strongly support the above aberrations. However, concomitant treatment with <b>sulphated</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> restored the above deformities to near control and prevented the morphological alterations significantly. Conclusion Thus, the present study highlights that <b>sulphated</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> can act therapeutically against CsA-induced hepatotoxicity.

40|$|Several {{bacterial}} pathogens including Neisseria gonorrhoeae {{bind the}} human serum glycoprotein vitronectin. We aimed at defining the gonococcal receptor for vitronectin. Ligand blots demonstrated that vitronectin bound {{specifically to the}} heparin-binding outer-membrane protein OpaA, but that coating OpaA with the sulphated polysaccharide heparin was required for the interaction to occur. Bound vitronectin could be dissociated from OpaA-heparin-vitronectin complexes {{by the addition of}} excess heparin, indicating that <b>sulphated</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> provided the main linkage between the two proteins. Binding assays with intact micro-organisms substantiated the requirement of <b>sulphated</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> such as heparin and dextran sulphate for the efficient binding of vitronectin to OpaA+ gonococci. This was underscored by the increased binding of vitronectin to gonococci that had been preincubated with saturating concentrations of dextran sulphate, as opposed to the inhibition of vitronectin binding observed when bacteria were incubated simultaneously with vitronectin and saturating concentrations of dextran sulphate. Binding assays with dextran sulphates of various sizes indicated that vitronectin binding correlated with the size of the polysaccharide rather than with the amount of OpaA produced by the bacteria. The inability of zero-length cross-linking agents to couple vitronectin to OpaA provided further evidence that <b>sulphated</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> formed the linkage between vitronectin and OpaA. Infection experiments demonstrated that proteoglycan-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells efficiently internalized dextran sulphate/vitronectin-coated gonococci, suggesting that soluble <b>sulphated</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> could substitute for cell surface glycosaminoglycans in the internalization process.

40|$|There {{has been}} an {{increasing}} interest in biological activity of sulfated polysaccharides from marine algae due to alleged anticoagulant, antioxidant and antithrombotic activities. Marine red algae of the genus Gracilaria are a major agarophyte resource {{in the world and}} are cultivated for the phycocolloid industry or for integrated marineculture. In this work, a polysaccharide was isolated by an aqueous extraction from the red seaweed Gracilaria birdiae (Gb), with a yield of 27. 2 %. The sulfate content of polysaccharide was 8. 4 % and it is composed mainly by galactose (65. 4 % mol), 3, 6 -anhydrogalactose (25. 1 % mol), and 6 -O-methylgalactose (9. 2 % mol).

30|$|Presence of polysaccharides in {{seaweeds}} {{has been}} reported for various biological activities including cholesterol lowering, immunomodulatory, In vitro and In vivo anti-hepatotoxic activity [23, 24] and antiproliferative activity [25]. Seaweeds contain commercially important polysaccharides, named as agar, fucoidan, alginate, carrageenan, laminaran and sulphated galactan [12]. In the present study intoxication of acetaminophen (AAP) in experimental rats caused liver damage as evident from {{the increase in the}} level of hepatic enzymes; AST, ALT, ALP and LDH along with increase in serum bilirubin, glucose, triglycerides, urea and creatinine. It is well established that when the liver is injured as a result of introduction of infectious agents or chemicals, the serum levels of GPT (ALT) and GOT (AST) are raised significantly [26], along with leakage of ALP and LDH [27] reflecting the severity of liver injury [28]. In present study the treatment with both fractions of crude <b>sulphated</b> <b>polysaccharides,</b> EW 1 and EW 2 fraction of Sargassum swartzii significantly (p[*]<[*] 0.05) reduced the elevated level of ALT, AST, ALP, and LDH and all other biochemical parameters. The highest activity was found in EW 1 fraction of S. swartzii. All parameters including liver marker enzymes, bilirubin, triglycerides, cholesterol and urea were statistically equal in both silymarin and EW 1 fraction of S. swartzii in acetaminophen-induced liver injury. Silymarin regenerates liver tissues, help in protein synthesis, reverses glutathione fall in tissue, enhanced glucuronidation and reduced inflammation, hence it acts as antioxidant, antifibrotic, anti-inflammatory, membrane stabilization and immunomodulatory agent [29]. In current study the crude <b>sulphated</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> (EW 1) extracted at room temperature showed its maximum protective effect might be due to its antioxidant properties and presence of higher concentration of sulphated polysaccharide as reported by Ponce et al. [19] in a brown seaweed Adenocystis utricularis. They have reported 30 % sulphate in EW 1 as compared to 8 % in EW 2. Vijayabaskar et al. [30] reported antioxidant activity of Sargassum swartzii due to presence of 10.43 % crude sulfated polysaccharide in seaweed. The hepatoprotective effect of crude <b>sulphated</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> have also been reported by other researchers [31 – 33]. The <b>sulphated</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> from Sargassum polycystum showed protective effect against paracetamol induced toxic hepatitis in rats [31]. Ross et al. [33] also reported that <b>sulphated</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> from Sargassum siliquosum produced hepatoprotective activity against acetaminophen induced liver damage. <b>Sulphated</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> have ability to inhibit viral replication against HIV, hepatitis and herpes viruses [11], to stimulate immune system [14] and to protect against hepatocellular carcinomas [34], {{may be due to the}} prevention of increased pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL- 6 and IL- 12 [35].|$|E

40|$|Heparin catalyses the {{inhibition}} of two key enzymes of blood coagulation, namely Factor Xa and thrombin, by enhancing the antiproteinase activities of plasma antithrombin III and heparin cofactor II. In addition, heparin can directly inhibit the activation of Factor X and prothrombin. The contributions {{of each of}} these effects to the anticoagulant activity of heparin have not been delineated. We therefore performed experiments to assess how each of these effects of heparin contributes to its anticoagulant activity by comparing the effects of heparin, pentosan polysulphate and D-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH 2 Cl on the intrinsic pathway of coagulation. Unlike heparin, pentosan polysulphate catalyses only the {{inhibition of}} thrombin by plasma. D-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH 2 Cl is rapid enough an inhibitor of thrombin so that when added to plasma no complexes of thrombin with its inhibitors are formed, whether or not the plasma also contains heparin. Heparin (0. 66 microgram/ml) and pentosan polysulphate (6. 6 micrograms/ml) completely inhibited the intrinsic-pathway activation of 125 I-prothrombin to 125 I-prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 and 125 I-thrombin. On the addition of thrombin, a good Factor V activator, to the plasma before each <b>sulphated</b> <b>polysaccharide,</b> the inhibition of prothrombin activation was demonstrable only in the presence of higher concentrations of the <b>sulphated</b> <b>polysaccharide.</b> D-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH 2 Cl also completely inhibited the intrinsic-pathway activation of prothrombin in normal plasma. The inhibitory effect of D-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH 2 Cl was reversed if thrombin was added to the plasma before D-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH 2 Cl. The inhibition of the activation of prothrombin by the three agents was also abolished with longer times with re-added Ca 2 +. Reversal of the inhibitory effects of heparin and pentosan polysulphate was associated with the accelerated formation of 125 I-thrombin-antithrombin III and 125 I-thrombin-heparin cofactor complexes respectively. These results suggest that the anticoagulant effects of heparin and pentosan polysulphate are mediated primarily by their ability to inhibit the thrombin-dependent activation of Factor V, thereby inhibiting the formation of prothrombinase complex, the physiological activator of prothrombin...|$|R

Inhibition of Leishmania (L.) amazonensis growth was 55 % with 5 μg/mL of Go 3, 50 % and 98 % to G 3 d and EHW-I, respectively at 10 μg/mL, and 88 % with 10 μg/mL of ARAGAL. The superoxide anion scavenging activity for the <b>sulphated</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> varied from approximately 30 – 55 % at 10 μg/mL. In conclusion, {{the results of the}} present study indicate the promising potential of these polysaccharides for the development of new alternative therapeutic agents against leishmaniasis...|$|E
40|$|Fucoidans {{are complex}} <b>sulphated</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> derived from {{abundant}} and edible marine algae. Helicobacter pylori is a stomach pathogen that persists in the hostile milieu {{of the human}} stomach unless treated with antibiotics. This study aims to provide preliminary data to determine, in vitro, if fucoidans can inhibit the growth of H. pylori {{and its ability to}} adhere to gastric epithelial cells (AGS). We analysed the activity of three different fucoidan preparations (Fucus A, Fucus B, and Undaria extracts). Bacterial growth was not arrested or inhibited by the fucoidan preparations supplemented into culture media. All fucoidans, when supplemented into tissue culture media at 1000 [*]µg[*]mL− 1, were toxic to AGS cells and reduced the viable cell count significantly. Fucoidan preparations at 100 µg[*]mL− 1 were shown to significantly reduce the number of adherent H. pylori. These in vitro findings provide the basis for further studies on the clinical use of <b>sulphated</b> <b>polysaccharides</b> as complementary therapeutic agents...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCultivation of {{commercial}} oysters is now facing the possible influence of global change in sea water composition, {{commonly referred to}} as "ocean acidification". In order to test the potential consequence of the predicted environmental changes, a cultivation experiment was carried out. The left and right valves of the oyster shell Crassostrea gigas differ in their structure; moreover, lenses of non compact layers are irregular. The shell layers of juvenile Crassostrea gigas are studied using a variety of highly spatially-resolved techniques to establish their composition and structure. Our results confirm the presence of three different calcitic structural types. The role of the lenses of chalky layers is not yet deciplered. Despite a common mineralogy, the elemental composition of the layers differs. The sulphur aminoacids and <b>sulphated</b> <b>polysaccharide</b> contents of the intracrystalline and intercrystalline matrices differ, {{as well as those of}} the structural types. The possible different sensitivity of these structures to environmental changes is still unknow...|$|R
40|$|The author gives {{a survey}} of groups of {{substances}} which have a marked and selective effect on HI thus serving as potential chemotherapeutical means against AIDS. They {{can be divided into}} three groups: 1. anionic substances, 2. 2, 3 -dideoxynucleoside analogues and 3. <b>sulphate</b> <b>polysaccharides.</b> The mechanism of the effect of the substances of the 2 nd group probably inhibits reverse HIV transcriptase. The substances of the 3 rd group are to prevent adsorption of virus particles by the cells. The substances of the 1 st group inhibit HIV transcriptase but also interfere with the adsorption process of the virus particles, or with other stages and phases of the HIV replication cycle. The crystallized substances of these groups should be further studied as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of AIDS and other retrovirus infections (PMEA, D 4 T, dextran-sulphate, pentosan, polysulphate and others). The survey also includes information on the so-called anti-sense RNA. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{represents}} a challenging effort aiming at converting the waste algal biomass Ulva sp. into {{a source of}} high added value materials for biomedical applications {{by means of a}} clean and sustainable process. Ulvan, a <b>sulphated</b> <b>polysaccharide</b> extracted from Ulva sp., is investigated as in situ gelling material by using the enzyme horseradish peroxidase as catalyst and H 2 O 2 as reagent. The polysaccharide is successfully modified with tyramine units in order to be susceptible to enzymatic recognition and crosslinking through oxidative coupling. The times of gelation of ulvan-tyramine solutions are optimized by adjusting the amount of H 2 O 2 used for ensuring their practical administration as injectable systems. The rheological properties of the polymeric solutions and the relevant hydrogels evaluated under operative conditions prove to be suitable as injectable in situ forming 3 D-hydrogels. The preliminary biological assays evidence the full cytocompatibility of the developed hydrogels and their feasibility for being used as 3 D-hydrogels for cell delivery...|$|R
