This article presents a basic mathematical model {{with the aim}} of evaluating radial pressure and transversal stress on bobbins at different angles of winding, different yarn tensions and yarn cross-section areas. Considering the additional complexities of the real problem, an experimental comparison of bobbin alterations under different conditions was carried out with the realisation of two experimental sets. The first experimental test bench allows the variation of winding tension, angle of winding and stroke, then experimental tests were carried out on a winding machine SAVIO varying the yarn tension value and adding a mechanical constrain to the device {{with the aim of}} reducing yarn-sliding phenomena, in particular during the thermal cycle. The fundamental parameters have been determined as the angle of wind and the yarn tension during the winding operation. Higher values of wind angle help keeping the bobbin shape. Higher values of yarn tension during winding operation allow the preservation of bobbin shape after the dyeing cycle. On the other hand, the upper limit is represented by yarn tensile strength. Moreover, it is not useful to apply a varying wind tension during the winding proces...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to provide reliable information, provided in the form of statistical models, regarding the possibilities of modifying the structure and the mechanical properties of fancy yarns by changing the component yarns' characteristics and the machine settings. Three types of fancy <b>yarns</b> (<b>spiral</b> <b>yarns,</b> loop yarns and bunch yarns) were produced via the ring twisting method. The statistical dependencies between (some) component yarn characteristics and machine settings as input and (some) fancy yarn characteristics and structure as output are presented in this paper...|$|R

5000|$|Rounding weaves a <b>spiral</b> of <b>yarn</b> {{over the}} {{crosswise}} laid strands, {{starting from the}} centre. This step gives most of the pattern variation for a wheel button. 'Blandford Cartwheels' may stop {{after only a few}} turns of rounding. 'Crosswheels' have very little rounding and their cross strands are prominent. 'Basket weave' uses an extensive rounding, visible on the top surface and hiding the cross strands.|$|R
50|$|Many novelty yarns {{make use}} of special plying {{techniques}} to gain their special effects. By varying {{the tension in the}} strands, or the relative sizes of the strands, or many other factors different effects can be achieved. For example, when a soft, thick strand is plied against a tightly twisted thin strand, the resulting <b>yarn</b> <b>spirals.</b> Another example is boucl√©, which is a yarn where one strand is held loosely and allowed to make loops on the other yarn while plying.|$|R
