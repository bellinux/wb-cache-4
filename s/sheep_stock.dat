5000|$|Up {{until the}} arrival of the Spanish Missionaries, the region was a series of native villages built around two {{different}} natural springs. The natives were then drafted to Mission San Gabriel and Mission San Juan Capistrano, which was later known as [...] "Rancho San Joaquin", until it went into debt and was sold in 1864 to James Irvine, a financier from San Francisco, along with three other ranchers, however in 1876, when their <b>sheep</b> <b>stock</b> began to fail from drought, poor wool, and the increasingly competitive marketplace, James Irvine bought out his partners prior to his death. His son, James Irvine II, then inherited the ranch and began to expand the production of the land by leasing it to agriculturally diverse farmers, and formed [...] "The Irvine Company" [...] in 1894. Being a favorite spot to James Irvine II, he allowed his friends and family as well as employees to build cottages on the area that we now refer to as Crystal Cove. As cottages began to undergo renovations and become more permanent residences, the owners were offered a choice by the Irvine Company to either move the cottages elsewhere or to hand over ownership and allow them to be leased by the company. These cottages were developed by the Irvine Company and the location was called the Crystal Cove Community. [...] In 1927, the Irvine Co. leased a portion of the area to a businessman who sold propane to coastal farmers and became a camping site named [...] "Tyrone's Camp". Trailers replaced tent camping in the 1940s and in 1954, it was renamed El Morro. [...] About 290 mobile home trailers on the beachfront and inland area were primary homes for some families up to four generations. In 2006, after 26 years of litigation, the California Coastal Commission, who purchased the property in 1979, evicted the tenants and demolished the El Morro Village mobile home park converting the private community into a day-use and overnight campground. [...] The area was renovated to also include a visitors center for tourist information, dining areas along the beachfront, cultural center, museums and the Park and Marine Research Facility. The Crystal Cove Historic District, a National Register of Historic Places site, inside the park contains 46 beach cottages from the 1920s and 1930s, of which 29 have been restored. 21 of these cottages are available for rent. [...] The house from the Bette Midler movie Beaches is located in Crystal Cove. One of the fun traditions at the restaurant in the Crystal Cove Historic District has its historical roots dating back to the 1940s. “Cove-ite’s”, Crystal Cove residents, led by Doc Shearer, who also was the leader of Los Angeles’s Shriners’ Top Hat Band, would salute the raising of Doc's Martini flag as Doc Shearer played reveille on his trumpet. That historic moment is re-created every day at 5:00 PM and 7:00 PM, by the Beachcomber Restaurant to signal the official start of cocktail hour and the serving of Martinis.|$|E

The analysis method {{was based on an}} econometrics time series, and the analysis began with the estimation of models that used linear and semi logarithmic regression. The estimation of the models proved that there were structural changes in sheep production in these regions, and this estimation used the wool crisis as a point of reference. In Rio Grande do Sul after 1990, the variables of <b>sheep</b> <b>stock,</b> wool and sheep meat presented a negative variable in their posted annual growth rates, as they decreased by 5. 9 %, 5. 6 % and 5. 6 %, respectively.

Therefore, the sheep market was permanently affected, which dynamically determined the evolution of sheep production and was defined by changes and uncertainty...|$|E
40|$|This master thesis {{compares the}} Norwegian model for {{compensation}} of sheep lost due to predation {{with the social}} planner optimum. The Norwegian model {{is based on the}} concept of compensating the observed damage caused by carnivores. I also analyze an alternative compensation scheme where the compensation is paid in advance. The results of the analysis shows that the usual compensation scheme removes farmers’ incentives to protect their herd. This do not occur in the alternative model. However it might be that this alternative model is difficult to use in Norway because of distribution and fairness. It is shown that the conservation agency can maintain protective effort through subsidies under the assumption that there are no moral hazard. But even with this correction, it seems like the Norwegian compensation scheme gives the sheep herders’ increased profitability, and thus their <b>sheep</b> <b>stock</b> is larger than what is considered social optimal. By a numerical example it is shown that the loss from the compensation scheme, when protective effort is not subsidized, is greater the greater the effect of the protective effort. Thus it seems like the present Norwegian compensation scheme is costly in terms of transaction costs, but that the alternative approach might not be a perfect solution either. </p...|$|E

In Britain, there is particular concern that severe grazing pressure is deleteriously affecting vegetation and birds in upland regions. However, the mechanism by which grazing affects birds is unclear. Here, we report for the first time, to our knowledge, that sheep grazing pressure affects the egg size of a common upland passerine: the meadow pipit Anthus pratensis. We manipulated <b>sheep</b> <b>stocking</b> densities in a replicated field experiment, and found that plots with the highest stocking density contained nests with the smallest eggs, and that plots with low stocking density contained nests with the largest eggs. However, eggs laid in ungrazed plots were also small, suggesting that either too many sheep or their removal from upland areas might have a detrimental effect on pipit egg size. We found no significant effect on fledging success but the reduced post-fledging survival of young from smaller eggs, as seen in other studies, could partly explain declines in upland birds...|$|R

Conversion of 400 ha, 600 breeding ewes (in 3 flocks) and 35 suckler cows was completed in 1993.
