The <b>servo</b> <b>actuator</b> of a parallel yaw damper will actuate the rudder independently of the rudder pedals while the <b>servo</b> <b>actuator</b> of a series yaw damper is clutched to the rudder control quadrant and will result in pedal movement when the system commands the rudder to move.|$|E
50|$|Yaw dampers usually {{consist of}} a yaw rate sensor (either a {{gyroscope}} or angular accelerometer), a computer/amplifier and a <b>servo</b> <b>actuator.</b> The yaw damper uses yaw rate sensor to sense when the aircraft begins a Dutch roll. A computer processes the signals from the yaw rate sensor to {{determine the amount of}} rudder movement that is required to dampen out the Dutch roll. The computer then commands the <b>servo</b> <b>actuator</b> to move the rudder that amount. The Dutch roll is dampened out and the aircraft becomes stable about the yaw axis. Because Dutch roll is an instability that is inherent to all swept-wing aircraft, most swept-wing aircraft have some sort of yaw damper system installed.|$|E

In robotic applications, <b>servo</b> <b>actuators</b> are applied for fast and precise positioning of joint axes, manipulators or senors. The drives {{have to be}} able to move to the desired positions without any overshoot and need to provide high stead-state accuracy despite fast changes in load torque and disturbances.

However, the Air Force and General Dynamics remained hard at work trying to fix the problems with the F-111A. The 428th TFS of the 474th TFW reached an initial operational capability in the spring of 1968.

40|$|Aircraft primary {{flight control}} {{surfaces}} are typically driven by two linear hydraulic actuators accepting the controlled flows from two independent hydraulic systems. When the actuators {{are part of a}} fly-by-wire system, actuators flows are controlled by valves, and a key issue is to ensure a pressure matching between the two actuators to prevent force fighting with a resulting loss of stiffness and dynamic performance. Different solutions have been used to minimize the pressure mismatch between two redundant electro hydraulic actuators, but limited use has been done of techniques based on generating compensation signals to reduce the difference between the pressure differentials of the two <b>servo</b> <b>actuators.</b> The advances in microprocessors computing power offer new possibilities that can be exploited to perform a good pressure matching between redundant actuators by using an appropriate control strategy without the need of a complex hydraulic design.

The inputs for the model (blade pitch link loads and pilot input to trim the aircraft) are taken from flight tests measurements, current rotor computations being unable to predict blade root torsion moments vs azimuth with enough accuracy. The analysis is based on X 3 demonstrator flight tests, which showed high control system loads that used to reduce flight envelope during the first flight test campaign. Flight tests measurements are used to validate the kinematic model used for the optimization.

40|$|A Light Utility Helicopter (LUH), in {{the course}} of a {{training}} flight, leaving the ground during the taxi to take off, went into an uncontrolled rolling to the right; consequently the helicopter gradually laid down on the right side. The impact with the runway destroyed the rotating blades up to the hubs rotor. The accident investigation focused on main rotor oscillatory plate servo actuators. These components, directly linked to the cloche movements, regulate main rotor blades plane tilt and pitch. Following the preliminary examination, only front <b>servo</b> <b>actuator</b> attachment was found to be broken in two parts. In detail, the present paper deals with the fracture analysis results. The <b>servo</b> <b>actuator</b> attachment material is a 2014 Aluminum alloy extrudate, undergone to T 651 heat treatment. Fracture surfaces were examined by optical and electronic microscopy in order to determine the main morphological features and consequently to trace the origin of failure mechanism and causes. The accordance with the specification requirements about alloy composition was verified by quantitative elementary analysis through inductive coupled plasma spectroscopy (ICP); furthermore, semi-quantitative elementary analysis was locally verified by Energy dispersion spectroscopy X ray (EDS_RX). Finally, the hydrogen content of the material was evaluated by the total hydrogen analysis. Microstructural and technological alloy characteristics were verified as well by using metallographic microscopy and hardness testing of the material. Macroscopic fracture surfaces evidences were characterized by the lack of any significant plastic deformations and by the presence of symmetry compared to the <b>servo</b> <b>actuator</b> axis. Microscopic fracture features of both the investigated surfaces were not coherent to the hypothesis of an impact of the main rotor to the soil. Further achieved evidences, such as grain boundary fracture propagation, the presence of corrosion products, were all in accordance with a Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) progressive fracture mechanism. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) located the highest tensile stress value, when the <b>servo</b> <b>actuator</b> is in its nominal working condition, at the same points where the corrosion products were more concentrated (i. e. in the part of the fracture exposed to oxidative air effect for the longest time). The good agreement between FEA and morphological evidences allowed to determine the progressive fracture origin area, though it was not possible to individuate the crack initiation point. In fact, in correspondence to the initiation area of both the fracture surfaces, shining and flat morphology was found;. then there were evidence of plastic deformations, due to the detachment of a <b>servo</b> <b>actuator</b> part. The ICP analysis and hardness testing results were in accordance with the material specification requirements. However, the hydrogen content was one order of magnitude greater than the required value and many and unexpected globular formations were observed on the fracture surface. Part of these were dendritic formations, while the others looked smooth and shining. Further, FESEM boundary grain observation gave evidences of a high presence of precipitates on the investigated surfaces. Hence, observed microstructural characteristics, boundary grain precipitates and globular formations allowed to hypothesize possible overheating/eutectic melting phenomena, occurred during manufacturing processes. As widely reported in literature, the AA 2014 alloy is one of the aluminum-copper-magnesium-silicon type, employing copper aluminide (CuAl 2) as the primary precipitation-hardening agent. The need for a maximum Cu phase dispersion in solid solution requires a heat treatment range with an upper limit (507 °C) that is near to the melting of the eutectics (510 °C). Moreover, since the 1960 s, AA 2014 has been defined as sensitive to SCC. This condition is mainly related to the presence of coarse-grained and aligned CuAl 2 precipitates. This arrangement is due to an overheating (more than 507 °C) or to a cooling process carried out too slowly. Microstructural analysis was carried out on three items: 1) a large portion of the broken actuator attachment; 2) on a servoactuator coming from the same production batch; 3) on a <b>servo</b> <b>actuator</b> coming from a different production batch. The microstructure from the broken actuator attachment showed a great amount of precipitates (second phases) lengthwise aligned to the boundary grain, pores, and also cavities and dendritic globular formations. Analysis results, morphology evidences and reference images available on scientific literature were found to be in excellent agreement and validated the embrittlement and subsequent SCC mechanism hypotesis (intergranular failure propagation). In conclusion, flight accident causes are attributable to main rotor actuator attachment failure. Failure mechanism is classifiable as SCC supported by microstructural anomalies of the material. The investigation of the manufacturing process highlighted how one of the <b>servo</b> <b>actuator</b> batches was not properly produced due to poor control and accuracy of heat treatment temperature and/or cooling time. This led to hydrogen embrittlement and to a microstructural problem (globular formations and boundary grain precipitates). The combination of those phenomena caused an increase of the SCC sensitivity and were the basic progressive failure driving forces. Nevertheless, as above mentioned, alloy composition was found compliant with the material specification requirements and this just because none of the scheduled quality control tests is able to determine the peculiar microstructural anomalies reported...|$|E
