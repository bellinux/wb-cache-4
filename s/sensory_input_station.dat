To {{be effective in}} consumer marketing, electronic commerce must communicate cultural value by creating cultural presence in virtual environments that approximates actual environments. Presence {{the sense of being}} in an environment depends on the range of <b>sensory</b> <b>inputs,</b> the detail of the <b>sensory</b> <b>inputs</b> and the ability to choose and modify the available inputs. The sense of being in a social and cultural environment depends on <b>sensory</b> <b>inputs</b> and interactivity that identifies a cultural context.

In the "wake" phase of the learning algorithm, the network is driven by the bottom-up recognition connections and the top-down generative connections are trained to be better at reconstructing the <b>sensory</b> <b>input</b> from the representation chosen by the recognition process. In the "sleep" phase, the network is driven top-down by the generative connections to produce a fantasized representation and a fantasized <b>sensory</b> <b>input.</b> The recognition connections are then trained to be better at recovering the fantasized representation from the fantasized <b>sensory</b> <b>input.</b> [...] ...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{detecting}} significant and regionally specific correlations between <b>sensory</b> <b>input</b> and the brain's physiological response, as measured with functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI), is presented in this paper. The method involves testing for correlations between <b>sensory</b> <b>input</b> and the hemodynamic response after convolving the <b>sensory</b> <b>input</b> with an estimate of the hernodynamic response function. This estimate is obtained without reference to any assumed input. To lend the approach statistical validity, it is brought into the framework of statistical parametric mapping by using a measure of cross-correlations between <b>sensory</b> <b>input</b> and hemodynamic response that is valid in the presence of intrinsic autocorrelations. These autocorrelations are necessarily present, due to the hemodynamic response function or temporal point spread function...|$|R

50|$|Most of the {{research}} literature in the field has been about sensory perception, particularly vision, which is more easily conceptualized. However, the predictive coding framework could also be applied to different neural systems. Taking the sensory system as an example, the brain solves the seemingly intractable problem of modelling distal causes of <b>sensory</b> <b>input</b> through a version of Bayesian inference. It does this by modelling predictions of lower-level <b>sensory</b> <b>inputs</b> via backward connections from relatively higher levels in a cortical hierarchy (Clark, 2013). Constrained by the statistical regularities {{of the outside world}} (and certain evolutionarily prepared predictions), the brain encodes top-down generative models at various temporal and spatial scales in order to predict and effectively suppress <b>sensory</b> <b>inputs</b> rising up from lower levels. A comparison between predictions (priors) and <b>sensory</b> <b>input</b> (likelihood) yields a difference measure (e.g. prediction error, free energy, or surprise) which, if it is sufficiently large beyond the levels of expected statistical noise, will cause the generative model to update so that it better predicts <b>sensory</b> <b>input</b> in the future.|$|R

We report that {{for at least}} 30 minutes after pharyngeal stimulation, motor cortex excitability and area of representation for the pharynx increased, while esophagus representation decreased, without parallel changes in the excitability of brainstem-mediated reflexes. Therefore increased <b>sensory</b> <b>input</b> can drive long-term cross-system changes in motor areas of the cerebral cortex, which suggests that sensory stimulation might rehabilitate dysphagia, a frequent consequence of cerebral injury...|$|R

In preparations without movement-related <b>sensory</b> <b>input,</b> either of three strategies are used: (1) the axons of sensory neurons are cut by dorsal root transection; or (2) neuromuscular blockers are used to prevent contractions of muscles in response to motor neuron activity; or (3) the spinal cord is isolated in a bath of physiological saline.|$|R

Here, {{we focus on the}} control of movement in mammals, including humans. First, the <b>sensory</b> <b>inputs</b> most closely implicated in controlling movement are reviewed, with a focus on somatosensory receptors. The response properties of the large muscle receptors are examined in detail. The role of <b>sensory</b> <b>input</b> in the control of {{movement is}} then discussed, with an emphasis on the control of locomotion. The interaction between central pattern gener-ators and <b>sensory</b> <b>input,</b> in particular in relation to stretch reflexes, timing, and pattern forming neuronal networks is examined. It is proposed that neural signals related to bodily velocity form the basic descending command that controls locomotion through specific and well-characterized relationships between muscle activation, step cycle phase durations, and biomechanical out-comes. <b>Sensory</b> <b>input</b> is crucial in modulating both the timing and pattern forming parts of this mechanism.

40|$|Many {{immediate}} early genes (IEG) have activity-dependent induction in {{a subset}} of brain subdivisions or neuron types. However, none have been reported yet with regulation specific to thalamic-recipient <b>sensory</b> <b>input</b> neurons of the telencephalon or in the thalamic <b>sensory</b> <b>input</b> neurons themselves. Here, we report the first such gene, dual specificity phosphatase 1 (dusp 1). Dusp 1 is an inactivator of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and MAPK in turn activates expression of egr 1, {{one of the most}} commonly studied IEGs, as determined in cultured cells. We found that in the brain of naturally behaving songbirds and other avian species, hearing song, seeing visual stimuli, or performing motor behavior caused high dusp 1 up-regulation respectively in auditory, visual, and somatosensory input cell populations of the thalamus and thalamic-recipient <b>sensory</b> <b>input</b> neurons of the telencephalic pallium, whereas high egr 1 up-regulation occurred only in subsequently connected secondary and tertiary sensory neuronal populations of these same pathways. Motor behavior did not induce high levels of dusp 1 expression in the motor-associated areas adjacent to song nuclei, where egr 1 is up-regulated in response to movement. Our analysis of dusp 1 expression in mouse brain suggests similar regulation in the <b>sensory</b> <b>input</b> neurons of the thalamus and thalamic-recipient layer IV and IV neurons of the cortex. These findings suggest that dusp 1 has specialized regulation to <b>sensory</b> <b>input</b> neurons of the thalamus and telencephalon; they further suggest that this regulation may serve to attenuate stimulus-induced expression of egr 1 and other IEGs, leading to unique molecular properties of forebrain <b>sensory</b> <b>input</b> neurons...|$|R

The construction of <b>sensory</b> <b>inputs</b> and muscular activity model has a significant meaning medically and biologically because this model leads us {{to understand how the}} brain functions. Thus, it is important {{to examine the relationship between}} senses and muscular activity as the first steps in constructing this model. Therefore, purpose of this study is obtaining changes in muscular activity by changes in <b>sensory</b> <b>inputs.</b> To achieve this purpose the method to change <b>sensory</b> <b>inputs</b> is a challenging point. We propose a method of changing <b>sensory</b> <b>inputs</b> by inhibiting or stimulating three senses (visual, vestibular, and somatosensory senses) which are related to posture control. Concretely, A) the visual sense is inhibited by closed eyes, B) the vestibular sense is inhibited by a caloric test pouring cold water into the ear cavity, and C) the somatosensory sense is stimulated by touching a part of the body. Muscular activity is measured by electromyography (EMG) when subject's senses are inhibited or simulated by the method mentioned above.
