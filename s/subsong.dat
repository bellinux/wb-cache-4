50|$|When alone, a magpie {{may make}} a quiet musical warbling; these complex melodious warbles or <b>subsongs</b> are pitched at 2-4 KHz and do not carry for long distances.

Pairs of magpies often take up a loud musical calling known as carolling to advertise or defend their territory; one bird initiates the call with the second (and sometimes more) joining in. Often preceded by warbling, carolling is pitched between 6 and 8 kHz and has 4-5 elements with slurring indistinct noise in between. Birds will adopt a specific posture by tilting their heads back, expanding their chests, and moving their wings backwards.

5000|$|In {{the male}} zebra finch, vocal {{learning}} {{begins with a}} period of sensory acquisition or auditory learning where juveniles {{are exposed to the}} song of an adult male “tutor” at about posthatch day 30 to 60. [...] During this stage, juveniles listen and memorize the song pattern of their tutor and produce <b>subsong,</b> characterized by the production of highly variable syllables and syllable sequences. <b>Subsong</b> is thought to be analogous to babbling in human infants. Subsequently during the sensorimotor learning phase at posthatch day 35 to 90, juveniles practice the motor commands required for song production and use auditory feedback to alter vocalizations to match the song template. Songs during this period are plastic as specific syllables begin to emerge but are frequently in the wrong sequence, errors that are similar to phonological mistakes made by young children when learning a language. As the bird ages, its song becomes more stereotyped until at posthatch day 120 the song syllables and sequence are crystallized or fixed. At this point, the zebra finch can no longer learn new songs and thus sings this single song for the duration of its life.|$|E

50|$|Zebra finches are {{loud and}} boisterous singers. Their calls {{can be a}} loud beep, meep, oi! or a-ha!. Their song is a few small beeps, leading up to a rhythmic song of varying {{complexity}} in males. Each male's song is different, although birds of the same bloodline will exhibit similarities, and all finches will overlay their own uniqueness onto a common rhythmic framework. Sons generally learn the song of their fathers with little variation. There is a critical sensitive period during which juvenile males learn their songs by imitating a mature, male tutor. <b>Subsong</b> (early vocalizations) evolve into 'plastic song'. This plastic song is variable between renditions but begins to incorporate some recognizable elements of tutor songs. A study conducted by Nottebohm et al., has shown that birds were able to successfully imitate their tutor’s song after relatively short exposure (40 playbacks of the motifs lasting 30 seconds total) over the duration of their sensitive learning period. These birds eventually form a “template” of what their correct song should sound like. They rely on auditory feedback for both song learning and practice as juveniles and song maintenance as adults. Adult birds maintain their songs by correcting any deviations from their target song template. During adulthood, by around 90 days, the bird’s song goes through a crystallization phase where their song template is stable and it no longer changes.|$|E

Furthermore, after deafening, juveniles immediately changed their <b>subsong</b> by shortening the syllable durations but maintained the individual variability of their <b>subsong</b> temporal patterns, suggesting both auditory-sensitive modification and independent intrinsic regulation of vocal output.

40|$|In {{the process}} of song learning, songbirds such as the zebra finch shape their initial soft and poorly formed vocalizations (<b>subsong)</b> first into {{variable}} plastic songs with a discernable recurring motif and then into highly stereotyped adult songs. A premotor brain area critically involved in plastic and adult song production is the cortical nucleus HVC. One of HVC's primary afferents, the nucleus interface of the nidopallium (NIf), provides {{a significant source of}} auditory input to HVC. However, the premotor involvement of NIf has not been extensively studied yet. Here we report that brief and reversible pharmacological inactivation of NIf in juvenile birds leads to transient degradation of plastic song toward <b>subsong,</b> as revealed by spectral and temporal song features. No such song degradation is seen following NIf inactivation in adults. However, in both juveniles and adults NIf inactivation leads to a transient decrease in song stereotypy. Our findings reveal a contribution of NIf to song production in juveniles that agrees with its known role in adults in mediating thalamic drive to downstream vocal motor areas during sleep...|$|E
40|$|Sensory {{feedback}} {{is essential for}} the acquisition of complex motor behaviors, including birdsong. In zebra finches, auditory {{feedback is}} relayed to the descending motor pathway primarily through the nucleus interfacialis nidopalii (NIf). NIf projects to HVC - a premotor region essential for song, which projects to RA, a motor cortex analogue brain area that drives muscle activity required for vocalizations. NIf is also essential for &#x 2018;sleep replay&#x 2019;, a recapitulation of song-related neural dynamics in the motor pathway during sleep. Despite being one of the major inputs to the song control pathway, there is no known role for NIf in the production of zebra finch song. To address this, we reversibly inactivated NIf using TTX or Muscimol in 13 birds. We compared songs before and during inactivation and found large effects of NIf inactivation on song structure. Vocalizations after NIf inactivation resembled <b>subsong,</b> highly variable utterances typical of the very early phases of song learning. <b>Subsong</b> is driven by LMAN, the output nucleus of an avian basal ganglia circuit that projects to RA. To verify that NIf inactivations indeed switched song control from HVC to LMAN, we inactivated LMAN in conjunction with NIf in four birds. As with LMAN inactivations after HVC lesions, this manipulation led to a complete cessation of singing. We also lesioned NIf using ibotenic acid and saw the song recover within a day, consistent with previous studies. Our results show that NIf input to HVC is acutely necessary for generating learned vocal behavior in songbirds, and that in its absence vocal production reverts to <b>subsong</b> driven by LMAN. Absent NIf input, the song circuit reorganizes and recovers its ability to produce pre-lesion song over the course of 1 - 2 days, suggesting a redundant role for NIf that can be assumed by other parts of the song circuit...|$|E
40|$|An infant {{reaches out}} for her new toy, {{struggling}} day after day to simply grasp her fingers around it. A few years later, she hits a tennis serve, perfect in the timing of its intricately choreographed movements. How does a young brain learn to use the muscles it controls, to properly coordinate motor gestures into complex behavioral sequences? To a surprising extent, for many advanced vertebrate behaviors this knowledge is neither innately programmed nor acquired via deterministic developmental rules, but must be learned through trial-and-error exploration. This thesis is {{an investigation of the}} neural mechanisms that underlie the production and maturation of one exploratory behavior - the babbling, or <b>subsong,</b> of a juvenile zebra finch. Using lesions and inactivations of brain areas in the song system, I identified neural circuits involved in the production of <b>subsong.</b> Remarkably, <b>subsong</b> did not require the high vocal center (HVC) - a premotor structure long known as the key region for controlling singing in adult birds - but did require the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the nidopallium (LMAN) - the output region of basal ganglia-forebrain circuitry previously considered a modulatory area. Recordings in LMAN during <b>subsong</b> revealed premotor activity related to the vocal output on a fast timescale. These results show, for the first time, the existence of a specialized circuit for driving exploratory motor control, distinct from the one that produces the adult behavior. The existence of two neural pathways for singing has raised the question of how motor control is transferred from one pathway to another and, in particular, how the control of song timing develops in these pathways. I found that early singing can be decomposed into mechanistically distinct "modes" of syllable and silent gap timing - randomly-timed modes that are LMAN-dependent and developmentally-acquired, consistently-timed modes that are HVCdependent. Combining acoustic analysis with respiratory measurements, I found that the consistently-timed mode in gap durations is formed by brief inspiratory pressure pulses, indicating an early involvement of HVC in coordinating singing with respiration. Using mild localized cooling - a manipulation that slows down biophysical processes in a targeted brain area - I found that the circuit dynamics intrinsic to HVC and LMAN are actively involved in controlling the timescales of distinct behavioral modes. In summary, this work demonstrates the existence of two motor circuits in the song system. These circuits are specialized for the generation of distinct types of neural dynamics - random exploratory dynamics, which are dominant early in life, and stereotyped sequential dynamics, which become dominant during development. Characterization of behaviorally-relevant dynamics produced by neural circuits may be a general framework for understanding motor control and learning. by Dmitriy Aronov. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Vocal {{learning}} has evolved {{in only a}} few groups of mammals and birds. The developmental and evolutionary origins of vocal learning remain unclear. The imitation of a memorized sound is a clear example of vocal learning, but is that when vocal learning starts? Here we use an ontogenetic approach to examine how vocal learning emerges in a songbird, the chipping sparrow. The first vocalizations of songbirds, food begging calls, were thought to be innate, and vocal learning emerges later during <b>subsong,</b> a behavior reminiscent of infant babbling. Here we report that the food begging calls of male sparrows show several characteristics associated with learned song: male begging calls are highly variable between individuals and are altered by deafening; the production of food begging calls induces c-fos expression in a forebrain motor nucleus, RA, that is involved with the production of learned song. Electrolytic lesions of RA significantly reduce the variability of male calls. The male begging calls are subsequently incorporated into <b>subsong,</b> which in turn transitions into recognizable attempts at vocal imitation. Females do not sing and their begging calls are not affected by deafening or RA lesion.

40|$|The {{basal ganglia}} form the largest sub-cortical {{structure}} in the human brain and are implicated in numerous human diseases. In songbirds, as in mammals, basal ganglia-forebrain circuits are necessary for the learning and production of complex motor behaviors; however, the precise role of this circuitry remains unknown. This thesis is an investigation into how the anterior forebrain pathway (AFP), an avian basal ganglia-forebrain circuit, supports vocal learning in the songbird. This investigation reveals two previously undiscovered functions of the AFP- both related to reinforcement, or trial-and-error, learning. One necessary component of reinforcement learning is the generation of variable behavior. The songs of learning juvenile birds are naturally highly variable. Rapid pharmacological inactivation of the AFP output nucleus causes an immediate and dramatic reduction in this variability. In addition, the first single-unit recordings of AFP output neurons in singing juvenile birds reveal little correlation with plastic song and a premotor correlation with the most variable form of singing, <b>subsong.</b> These results suggest a novel function for basal ganglia-forebrain circuitry i...|$|E
40|$|Species-specific {{behaviours}} gradually emerge, via incomplete patterns, to {{the final}} complete adult form. A classical example is birdsong, a learned behaviour ideally suited for studying the neural and molecular substrates of vocal learning. Young songbirds gradually transform primitive unstructured vocalizations (<b>subsong,</b> akin to human babbling) into complex, stereotyped sequences of syllables that constitute adult song. In comparison with birdsong, territorial and mating calls of vocal non-learner species are thought to exhibit little change during development. We revisited this issue using the crowing behaviour of domestic Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica). Crowing activity was continuously recorded in young males maintained in social isolation {{from the age of}} three weeks to four months. We observed developmental changes in crow structure, both the temporal and the spectral levels. Speed and trajectories of these developmental changes exhibited an unexpected high inter-individual variability. Mechanisms used by quails to transform sounds during ontogeny resemble those described in oscines during the sensorimotor phase of song learning. Studies on vocal non-learners could shed light on the specificity and evolution of vocal learning...|$|E
40|$|Complex motor {{behaviors}} in humans, such as speech, are not innate, but instead are learned. How does the brain construct neural circuits that generate these motor behaviors during learning? To understand the neural mechanisms underlying learned motor skills, I use vocal learning in songbirds as a model. While {{previous studies have}} shown that a premotor area in the songbird brain, HVC, is important for stereotyped adult song, the role of HVC in juvenile song is less known. This thesis characterizes how activity in HVC develops during song learning in juvenile birds. Early in song learning, temporal structure emerged in HVC. During the earliest vocalization of juvenile birds (<b>subsong),</b> HVC neurons exhibit bursts of action potentials. However, only half of the neurons show bursts that are temporally aligned to syllables, and most of these bursts are clustered around onsets of <b>subsong</b> syllables. Over several days, as the bird starts producing the earliest stereotyped vocalization called protosyllables, HVC neurons start exhibiting rhythmic bursts at 5 - 10 Hz. These rhythmic bursts are aligned to protosyllables, and bursts from different neurons are active at different latencies relative to protosyllables. Thus, as a population, HVC neurons start forming a rhythmic neural sequence. As the bird matures, multiple distinct syllable types emerge from a protosyllable. During this process, some neurons are active only during a specific syllable type ('specific neurons') while others are active during both syllable types ('shared neurons'). These shared neurons are active at similar latencies for both syllable types, and therefore form a shared neural sequence. Over development, fraction of shared neurons decrease and more neurons become specific. These results demonstrate that splitting of a neural sequence into multiple sequences underlies the emergence of a multiple syllable types. Moreover, this sequence splitting is observed during different song learning strategies, suggesting that this is a fundamental neural mechanism for song learning. This work demonstrates how the growth of a rhythmic neural sequence and its subsequence splitting gives rise to complex vocalization in songbirds. This may be a general neural mechanism in which the brain constructs neural circuits during learning of a complex motor behavior. by Tatsuo Okubo. Thesis: Ph.

40|$|The {{basal ganglia}} form the largest sub-cortical {{structure}} in the human brain and are implicated in numerous human diseases. In songbirds, as in mammals, basal ganglia-forebrain circuits are necessary for the learning and production of complex motor behaviors; however, the precise role of this circuitry remains unknown. This thesis is an investigation into how the anterior forebrain pathway (AFP), an avian basal ganglia-forebrain circuit, supports vocal learning in the songbird. This investigation reveals two previously undiscovered functions of the AFP - both related to reinforcement, or trial-and-error, learning. One necessary component of reinforcement learning is the generation of variable behavior. The songs of learning juvenile birds are naturally highly variable. Rapid pharmacological inactivation of the AFP output nucleus causes an immediate and dramatic reduction in this variability. In addition, the first single-unit recordings of AFP output neurons in singing juvenile birds reveal little correlation with plastic song and a premotor correlation with the most variable form of singing, <b>subsong.</b> These results suggest a novel function for basal ganglia-forebrain circuitry {{in the production of}} exploratory behavior. A second component of reinforcement learning is the evaluation of performance-based feedback - auditory feedback in the case of singing. Conditional disruptive auditory feedback is a novel behavioral paradigm capable of causing rapid experimentally-controlled vocal learning. Inactivating the AFP while using this new paradigm to induce learning reveals that the AFP biases motor output to improve auditory feedback. This result suggests that basal gangliaforebrain circuits are involved in the evaluation of performance-based feedback. It also suggests {{for the first time that}} these circuits are capable of producing temporally precise premotor drive that incrementally improves a motor skill. In summary, this investigation significantly furthers the view that basal ganglia-forebrain circuitry is involved in reinforcement learning. It ascribes two functions to the anterior forebrain pathway: to drive variable behavior; and to bias future behavior incrementally towards better performance. By analogy, basal ganglia-thalamocortical loops may perform similar functions in mammals. by Aaron Samuel Andalman. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Graduation date: 1973 The {{songs of}} the Bewick's Wren are {{discrete}} units of one to three seconds duration with intersong intervals several times {{the length of the}} song. Individual song repertoires at the William Finley National Wildlife Refuge, Oregon, range from 13 to 20 song types, and a given song type is repeated many times before another song type is introduced. The entire song repertoire is often sung before any song type bouts are repeated. Attempts to stimulate and to reduce attendant habituation may have been a selective force in the evolution of large song repertoires. Juveniles gain independence from their parents at approximately 35 days of age. Birds disperse as far as 3. 2 km, and males may establish permanent territories and begin developmental <b>subsong</b> by 60 days of age. Sensitivity for song learning is probably maximal between 30 and 60 days. Some song variations which are developed by young males appear to be retained from exposure to songs prior to establishing a territory, but most song variations retained in the repertoire are those which match the songs of neighboring territorial males. Thus, neighboring males have very similar song type repertoires. Juveniles may disperse across minor habitat barriers which prevent frequent contact of territorial males on opposite sides, and song learning across such barriers is therefore hindered. The spread of new song variations formed through imperfect copying of a model song, or perhaps through improvisation or "drift", may be restricted by such minor barriers, and local dialects in relatively isolated habitat patches may thus be formed. Because the sensitive period for song learning in the Bewick's Wren occurs after dispersal from the home territory, dialect boundaries do not reflect population boundaries as is hypothesized for some species. The song repertoire size of individuals at the Finley refuge is dependent upon the date of hatching; birds hatched early in the breeding season are exposed to and learn more songs or song elements than birds hatched later in the breeding season. If juvenile males assess habitat quality when searching for a territory, repertoire size in the first breeding season may be positively correlated with habitat quality, and females could possible recognize this correlation. Differences in 14 measured song parameters at nine geographical locations in Oregon, California, Arizona, and Colorado reveal marked geographical differences. The frequency range of song sphrases was correlated with latitude and presumed species richness, and the frequency range of song phrases for the depauperate fauna of Santa Cruz Island, California, was similar to the frequency range of wrens at more northern latitudes, suggesting the possibility that species-rich communities may demand more stereotyped and less variable songs for species recognition. No such patterns were evident in the other 13 measured song parameters...|$|E
40|$|The Noisy Miner is a {{communal}} breeder: many individuals participate in activities at each nest. However, {{much of the}} species’s behaviour and social organization is unique, even among communal breeders. Marked populations were observed in south-eastern Queensland between 1969 and 1974 but most data are from one intensely studied area in 1972, with additional data from 1971 and 1973. In this study area of seven hectares, 137 birds were colour-banded. The resident population declined {{in the three years}} from 9. 0 to 7. 7 birds per hectare. The sex ratio favoured males by as much as 3. 3 : 1. Most breeding occurred between July and November. The onset of nesting varied from year to year and could not be easily related to environmental variables. Most nests were built in sites that did not afford much concealment. The height of nests varied but preference was mot shown by particular females. Successive nests tended to be higher, effected by females selecting higher trees. Spiders’ web and silk from cocoons was used in the construction of nests. The female built the nest and advertised its position with a flight display. Previous nests were dismantled and used {{in the construction of the}} nests. Building visits averaged 8. 7 per hour and as many as seven males visited a nest at this stage. Females did not visit other nests. Males visiting the nest of an incubating female were all found to be producing spermatoza and at any time of year probably some males in a population are producing sperm. In some years some adult females made no nesting attempts. Clutches varied from one to four and averaged 2. 64 eggs. The first egg was laid in fewer than three days or more than nine after completion of the nest. Eggs were laid one each day usually, in the early morning, and females began to sit after the second egg was laid. Only one female incubated and incubation took sixteen days. Attendance at the nest by females at different stages in incubation averaged from 35. 2 to 41. 2 minutes per hour. The mean brood size was 2. 52; 15. 9 per cent of eggs, excluding those lost, failed to hatch. The nestling period was about sixteen days. Only the female brooded. Fledging proceeded over several days, the young gradually moving out on supporting branches in the day and returning to the nest at night. Once away from the nest, the young made their way to the top of a tree. They were highly vocal in soliciting food. When fed, the wings were not quivered, perhaps a behaviour counteracting the high activity of feeding adults. Feeding rates at this stage were as high as 87. 8 times per hour. Juveniles between twenty-six and thirty days from the nest were first threatened by adults. Between thirty-one and thirty-five days, they began to utter a quiet warbling <b>subsong.</b> Attacks by adults became more frequent and reached their greatest intensity between fifty and seventy days. Both males and females attacked juveniles. Nest success was very low, less than ten per cent in each of the three years. Even if some nests were never laid in, success calculated to exclude this possibility was still no greater than 16. 7 per cent in any year. Some loss could be attributed to wind and storms; presumably the remainder was through predation or activities of the Miners themselves. A new nest was usually started when a female lost eggs or nestlings, in one case in fewer than sixty hours...|$|E
