25|$|The low ISO {{rating of}} the <b>sheet</b> <b>film</b> Weston used necessitated very long {{exposures}} when using his view camera, ranging from 1 to 3 seconds for outdoor landscape exposures to as long as 4½ hours for still lifes such as peppers or shells. When he used one of the Graflex cameras the exposure times were much shorter (usually less than ¼ second), and he was sometimes able to work without a tripod.|$|E
25|$|Prior to 1921 Weston used an {{orthochromatic}} <b>sheet</b> <b>film,</b> {{but when}} panchromatic film became {{widely available in}} 1921 he switched to it {{for all of his}} work. According to his son Cole, after Agfa Isopan film came out in the 1930s Weston used it for his black-and-white images {{for the rest of his}} life. This film was rated at about ISO 25, but the developing technique Weston used reduced the effective rating to about ISO 12.|$|E
25|$|The 8 × 10 cameras he {{preferred}} were large and heavy, {{and due to}} the weight {{and the cost of}} the film he never carried more than twelve <b>sheet</b> <b>film</b> holders with him. At the end of each day, he had to go into a darkroom, unload the film holders and load them with new film. This was especially challenging when he was traveling since he had to find a darkened room somewhere or else set up a makeshift darkroom made from heavy canvas.|$|E

2500|$|The {{photographic}} work of Josef Jindřich {{was very}} much influenced by Anna Stocká, whom he married in 1911. Anna loved art, and thanks to her charm the family befriended several artists living in Tábor, in particular the sculptor Jan Vítězslav Dušek. In 1912 Josef Jindřich and Anna's daughter Ludmila was born, and all seemed well. Josef Jindřich didn't serve in the army during World War I, and thus {{had a chance to}} record life in Tábor during this period, including the fire that significantly damaged the Tábor studio in 1917. He recorded the fire in a unique photo-essay, with several snapshots made on small-format <b>sheet</b> <b>film,</b> and for a record, a [...] "reconstructed scene" [...] made afterwards as an exact reconstruction of one of the snapshots, on a 1318cm glass plate negative.|$|E
2500|$|Most of the scenes, backgrounds, {{and visual}} {{effects in the}} film were created using more {{traditional}} techniques and a unique process known as [...] "backlit animation". In this process, live-action scenes inside the computer world were filmed in black-and-white on an entirely black set, printed on large format Kodalith high-contrast film, then colored with photographic and rotoscopic techniques {{to give them a}} [...] "technological" [...] appearance. With multiple layers of high-contrast, large format positives and negatives, this process required truckloads of <b>sheet</b> <b>film</b> and a workload even greater than that of a conventional cel-animated feature. The Kodalith was specially produced as large sheets by Kodak for the film and came in numbered boxes so that each batch of the film could be used in order of manufacture for a consistent image. However, this was not understood by the filmmakers, and as a result glowing outlines and circuit traces occasionally flicker as the film speed varied between batches. After the reason was discovered, this was no longer a problem as the batches were used in order and [...] "zinger" [...] sounds were used during the flickering parts to represent the computer world malfunctioning as Lisberger described it. Lisberger later had these flickers and sounds digitally corrected for the 2011 restored Blu-ray release as they were not included in his original vision of the film. Due to its difficulty and cost, this process of back-lit animation was not repeated for another feature film.|$|E
50|$|Glass {{plates were}} later {{replaced}} by <b>sheet</b> <b>film</b> {{in a dark}} slide for sheet film; adaptor sleeves were made to allow <b>sheet</b> <b>film</b> {{to be used in}} plate holders. In addition to the ground glass, a simple optical viewfinder was often fitted. Cameras which take single exposures on <b>sheet</b> <b>film</b> and are functionally identical to plate cameras were used for static, high-image-quality work; much longer in 20th century, see Large-format camera, below.|$|E
50|$|Some large format cameras have {{rotating}} or sliding reduction backs, which mask off {{part of the}} <b>film</b> <b>sheet,</b> allowing several smaller {{photos to}} be placed on a single <b>sheet</b> of <b>film.</b>|$|R
50|$|As the acetate base shrinks, the gelatin {{emulsion}} of {{the film}} does not shrink, {{because it is not}} undergoing deterioration. The emulsion and film base separate, causing buckling, referred to by archivists as 'channelling.' <b>Sheet</b> <b>films</b> are often severely channelled in the later stages of degradation.|$|R
50|$|In some cases, pink or blue colors {{appear in}} some <b>sheet</b> <b>films.</b> This {{is caused by}} antihalation dyes, which are {{normally}} colorless and incorporated into the gelatin layer. When acetic acid is formed during deterioration, the acidic environment causes the dyes {{to return to their}} original pink or blue color.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{photographers who}} use large-format cameras and <b>sheet</b> <b>film</b> {{do their own}} film processing. Some more professionally {{oriented}} photographic labs will process color negative and positive <b>sheet</b> <b>film,</b> but the [...] "corner drug store" [...] photolab generally can not. There are multiple methods that can be used.|$|E
50|$|Most large format film is <b>sheet</b> <b>film,</b> that is, film {{where each}} picture is on a {{separate}} piece of film, requiring that the camera be frequently reloaded, usually after every picture, sometimes using magazines of up to five pictures or reduction backs that allow multiple pictures on a single sheet of film. Medium-format <b>sheet</b> <b>film</b> was produced for some cameras, but these cameras tend to be smaller, lighter, {{and easier to use}} than large format gear. <b>Sheet</b> <b>film</b> was never commonly used in cameras smaller than medium format.|$|E

50|$|A die in polymer {{processing}} is a metal restrictor or channel {{capable of}} providing a constant cross sectional profile to a stream of liquid polymer. This allows for continuous processing of shapes such as <b>sheets,</b> <b>films,</b> pipes, rods, and other more complex profiles. This is a continuous process, allowing for constant production (assuming constant supply of polymer melt), {{as opposed to a}} sequential (non-constant) process such as injection molding.|$|R

50|$|Rekstad {{was also}} an avid amateur photographer. His {{geological}} research trips took him across Norway and his camera was always with him on his expeditions. He primarily photographed geological formations, mountains, glaciers, and rock samples. However, he also took many striking photos of the settlements and people around him. His collection of negatives consists of 2,640 glass plates and <b>sheet</b> <b>films.</b> His photos are kept in the Rekstad Collection (Rekstads samling) at the University of Bergen Library.|$|R
50|$|An {{alternative}} use of Ilfochrome was for image capture directly {{inside a}} large format or ultra large format camera. This created a unique original positive photograph, {{in which the}} subject is reversed left-right unless a mirror or prism was used {{in front of the}} camera lens. A much longer exposure was required than with <b>sheet</b> <b>films</b> or plates designed for use in a camera. The procedure thus resembled the slow daguerreotype and ambrotype direct positive black-and-white processes used in the 1850s.|$|R

50|$|Traditionally, <b>sheet</b> <b>film</b> {{and glass}} plate holders {{have been made}} out of wood. Wooden holders, {{properly}} treated, can last a very long time, and apart from possible warpage, many very old specimens are still in service. Some companies continue to make wood models today, particularly for more uncommon film sizes, and as many are mostly handmade, they can be quite expensive. The majority of new <b>sheet</b> <b>film</b> holders are now made out of plastic.|$|E
50|$|Many of the {{standard}} sizes {{are the same as}} <b>sheet</b> <b>film</b> formats, and are appropriate for making contact sheets from these films.|$|E
50|$|Instant film is {{available}} in sizes from 24 x 36 mm (similar to 135 film) up to 50.8 x 61 cm size, with the most popular film sizes for consumer snapshots being approximately 83 x 108 mm (the image itself is smaller as it {{is surrounded by a}} border). Early instant film was distributed on rolls, but later and current films are supplied in packs of 8 or 10 sheets, and single <b>sheet</b> <b>films</b> for use in large format cameras with a compatible back.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Sheet</b> <b>films</b> have notches {{cut into}} one short side. This makes it simple to {{determine}} which side is the emulsion, when the film is hidden from sight (in the darkroom, or inside a changing bag). When holding the sheet in [...] "portrait" [...] orientation (short side up), with the notches in the upper right, the emulsion side is facing the photographer. The notch patterns vary in size and layout; each type of film has its own distinct pattern, {{commonly referred to as}} a notch code, to enable film type identification.|$|R
50|$|In {{making such}} films the soundtrack is first produced, {{analyzed}} and bar sheets made depicting the soundtrack details. Exposure <b>sheets</b> for <b>filming</b> (camera exposures) are then abstracted {{from the bar}} sheets.|$|R
50|$|Film holders that adapt {{rollfilm}} to <b>sheet</b> <b>film</b> {{cameras are}} usually called film backs. Film backs for 4&times;5 inch cameras are particularly common - {{there is little}} point in taking 6&times;9 cm pictures on a 20 x 25 cm camera. Horseman, Linhof, Graflex, and other manufacturers have made roll film holders in 6&times;7, 6&times;8, 6&times;9, 6&times;12, and 6&times;17 cm formats. Some models can slip under the ground glass like a normal <b>sheet</b> <b>film</b> holder, while others require that the photographer replace the ground glass with the roll holder.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sheet</b> <b>film</b> holders are {{generally}} interchangeable between various brands and models of view cameras, adhering to de facto standards. The largest cameras and more uncommon formats are less standardized.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Sheet</b> <b>film</b> is, simply enough, big, {{and as such}} has a proportionately great {{ability to}} hold information. The image on an 8x10 inch piece of <b>sheet</b> <b>film</b> has {{approximately}} fifty six times the surface area of a standard 35mm image. As compared to megapixels, when taking the LP/mm resolution of 8x10 Velvia the resolution is up to a value of 5,285 megapixels. [...] In theory, the [...] "enlargability" [...] of such an image is proportionately great although the very high image quality of small format lenses sometimes allows somewhat greater magnifications than some large format lenses. However, {{this is not always}} the case. <b>Sheet</b> <b>film</b> can be enlarged to poster, or even billboard, size with acceptable quality. It is far easier to do retouching directly on the surface of a sheet of film since the images are large, than on smaller formats. Many of the larger formats can be contact printed, and for some ultra-large formats, are only contact printed.|$|E
