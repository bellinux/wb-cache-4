25|$|The Holden comb was {{suited for}} the combing of <b>short</b> <b>staple</b> <b>wools.</b> The slivers of wool are fed into the machine through the feed guides to the filing head rollers and {{transferred}} to the pins of the comb circle by the lashing action of the filling heads. As the comb circle rotates, the fallers of the square motion rise, their pins piercing the fringe of fibres held in the comb circle by the keeper plate, and by drawing away give the fibres their initial combing. This removes any short fibres or noil and some long fibres termed robbings which are deposited in a box {{at the back of}} the square motion. As the comb circle carries the remaining fibres to the drawing-off head the fringe is penetrated by the pins of the intersecting or nacteur combs, the drawing-off rollers giving the fibres their final combing by removing the long fibres from the pins of the nacteur comb and the comb circle; the short ones being left behind. The long fibres or top pass through a revolving funnel to the coiler mechanism and into a can directly underneath. The short fibres or noils remaining in the nacteur combs are transferred to the comb circle by a small comb and removed with the noil in the comb circle pins by brushes and lifting knives and deposited into a box ready for removal.|$|R

40|$|A {{row spacing}} study was {{conducted}} on both long and <b>short</b> <b>staple</b> cotton on the Safford Agricultural Center. The {{results of this study}} showed that yields increased from the narrower spaced rows (36 - 30 inch and 30 inch spacings) to the wider spaced rows (36 inch and 40 inch spacings). This is the same trend as reported previously with long staple cotton but differs from that previously reported for <b>short</b> <b>staple</b> cotton.

50|$|It {{was made}} in several parts of England {{at the end of}} the medieval period. The raw {{material}} was <b>short</b> <b>staple</b> <b>wool,</b> carded and spun into yarn and then woven on a broad loom to produce cloth 1.75 yards wide. It was then fulled, usually in a fulling mill. When fulled, the fibres of the cloth would felt together, resulting in a smooth surface.|$|E
40|$|Two {{lactation}} {{studies with}} accompanying digestion trials {{were conducted to}} compare the feeding value of Pima cottonseed, with differing degrees of processing, to <b>short</b> <b>staple</b> cottonseed for lactating dairy cows. Additional tests were conducted to examine physical and chemical characteristics of both Pima and <b>short</b> <b>staple</b> cottonseed {{and the effect of}} processing on storage characteristics of cottonseeds. Pima cottonseed is higher in CP and ether extract and lower in NDF and ADF than <b>short</b> <b>staple</b> seed. Pima seed has a greater bulk density, a greater proportion of the (-) -gossypol isomer and a lower proportion of the (+) -gossypol compared to <b>short</b> <b>staple</b> cottonseed. In the first lactation study, milk yield was similar across all treatments. Milk fat was higher (P <. 05) for finely cracked Pima (x 3. 0 mm) and whole Pima diets. Feed efficiency was greatest (P <. 05) for the cracked Pima diet. Percentage whole seed passing into the feces of that consumed, was 11 % for the whole Pima and 5. 2 % for the <b>short</b> <b>staple.</b> Total tract digestibility of ADF decreased and that of ether extract increased in cows fed cracked Pima compared to whole Pima or <b>short</b> <b>staple.</b> In the second lactation study, milk yield was higher (P <. 05) for cows fed ground Pima (x 2. 5 mm), than either whole Pima or coarsely cracked Pima (x 3. 5 mm), with <b>short</b> <b>staple</b> intermediate. Feed efficiency (SCM/DMI) was greater for cows fed ground Pima and <b>short</b> <b>staple</b> diets (1. 14) than for those fed cracked Pima or whole Pima. Stearic acid was lower, and linoleic and linolenic acids were higher in milk of cows fed ground Pima compared to <b>short</b> <b>staple.</b> Passage of whole seed was two-times greater for cows fed whole Pima compared to whole <b>short</b> <b>staple</b> (12. 3 % vs. 6. 2 %), and processing of Pima seed eliminated whole seeds passing in the feces. Ether extract digestibility was lower for the whole Pima compared to the other treatments. Storage of whole, cracked or ground seeds at 32 °C and 30 % relative humidity for up to 30 d did not cause rancidity or aflatoxin contamination. Storage of processed seeds in covered containers for nine months caused only slight increases in free fatty acid content, and no change in the whole seeds...|$|R

40|$|Thirty six <b>short</b> <b>staple</b> {{varieties}} and thirteen long staple varieties were grown in a replicated field trial on the Safford Agricultural Center in Graham county. Stoneville 324 {{was the highest}} yielding <b>short</b> <b>staple</b> variety in the trial with a yield of 4733 pounds per acre of seed cotton. The average yields of <b>short</b> <b>staple</b> varieties was greater than in 1991. Long staple cotton did not fare {{as well with the}} weather as did the <b>short</b> <b>staple.</b> The yield of S- 6 was about 100 pounds of seed cotton less than in 1991. The good news is that other long staple varieties are being developed that can out yield S - 6 in the high desert area. O & A Pima was the highest yielding variety with a yield that exceeded S- 6 by about 500 pounds of seed cotton per acre. S- 7 followed closely behind O & A Pima 4 and both matured quicker than S- 6.

40|$|PIX {{was applied}} to long and <b>short</b> <b>staple</b> cotton in 5, 10 and 20 gallons of water in an {{incomplete}} factorial design involving 0. 5, 1 and 2 pints of the product per acre. Plant heights were significantly shortened and the percent of lint obtained in the first picking was significantly increased when Piz was applied on the <b>short</b> <b>staple</b> cotton. No statistically significant yield differences were observed between the volumes of dilution or the rates of application for either long or <b>short</b> <b>staple</b> cotton. A factor underlying the experiment was that the monsoon rains. They kept {{the surface of the}} ground moist and the plants looking good; however, the subsurface moisture had apparently been depleted, and the plants were under some stress.

40|$|Two <b>short</b> <b>staple</b> variety {{trials and}} 1 long staple variety trial were {{harvested}} in Greenlee county in 1988. In the <b>short</b> <b>staple</b> trial comparing {{the new and}} experimental New Mexico acalas with 2 other lower quality varieties, Genhains new GC 260 was the top yielding variety with 1, 087 pounds of lint per acre, but it came in fifth when comparing dollar value per acre because of the premium structure for the New Mexico acalas. Two new experimental acalas, 2745 and B 510, produced the highest income per acre. The <b>short</b> <b>staple</b> trial, which tested longer - season varieties, had problems with low micronaire values. The newly released 1517 - 88 variety produced the top yield and produced the most income per acre. Two of the experimental long staple varieties topped the yield of S- 6 and 3 of the 7 varieties tested yielded over 650 pounds of lint per acre...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1977 The {{purposes}} of this study were: to compare the strength (single strand breaking load and loop breaking load), the elongation and the evenness of four types represented by 11 brands of polyester sewing threads available on the market in Corvallis, Oregon in January, 1976; to determine whether there were differences in the strength and elongation of black and white threads; and to find the correlations between: the single strand breaking load and the loop breaking load of a thread; the single strand breaking load and the elongation of a thread; and the breaking load and the evenness of a thread. The four types of thread were: corespun polyester/cotton 2 -ply, corespun polyester/cotton 3 -ply, <b>short</b> <b>staple</b> spun polyester and tow spun polyester. Some differences were observed among different types and among various brands within the same type of thread in every property that was investigated. In comparing the single strand breaking loads, corespun 3 -ply threads were significantly stronger than the corespun 2 -ply thread of the same brand; corespun 3 -ply threads exhibited no significant differences from tow spun threads; <b>short</b> <b>staple</b> spun threads were significantly weaker than corespun 3 -ply and tow spun threads. Comparisons of loop breaking load indicated that tow spun threads still performed best, followed by <b>short</b> <b>staple</b> spun threads. Corespun 3 -ply threads were weaker than both tow spun threads and <b>short</b> <b>staple</b> spun threads. The corespun 2 -ply thread was the weakest of all. Corespun 3 -ply threads had better extensibility than the corespun 2 -ply thread and the <b>short</b> <b>staple</b> spun threads; <b>short</b> <b>staple</b> spun threads, in turn, were more extensible than tow spun threads. With a few exceptions, no significant differences in the breaking load and elongation of black and white thread occurred. The evenness of all 11 brands of thread was similar. Based on this study, the tow spun threads would be a good choice for fabrics with normal extensibility. Two of the three corespun 3 -ply threads would be suitable for fabrics which stretch more. No significant correlations were found between: single strand breaking load and loop breaking load; single strand breaking load and evenness; and loop breaking load and evenness. Although a high positive correlation between single strand breaking load and elongation was not significant at the. 05 level, the relationship appears fruitful for further study because only the tow spun threads and one of the <b>short</b> <b>staple</b> spun threads had a much lower rate of elongation relative to the single strand breaking load...|$|R
