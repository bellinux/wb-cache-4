5|$|Polish science {{reached its}} {{culmination}} {{in the first}} half of the 16th century. The medieval point of view was criticized, more rational explanations were attempted. Copernicus' De revolutionibus orbium coelestium, published in Nuremberg in 1543, shook up the traditional value system extended into an understanding of the physical universe, doing away with its Christianity-adopted Ptolemaic anthropocentric model and setting free the explosion of <b>scientific</b> <b>inquiry.</b> Generally the prominent scientists of the period resided in many different regions of the country, and increasingly, the majority were of urban, rather than noble origin.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{investigated}} {{to understand the}} in-depth features and processes of physicists' <b>scientific</b> <b>inquiries.</b> At first, research motives were investigated by interviewing six physicists who were prominent worldwide. As a result, three main types - incompleteness, discovery, and conflict - and nine subtypes of research motivation, were identified. Six additional background factors were found which might affect the design and start of research. Based on these findings, implications for teaching <b>scientific</b> <b>inquiries</b> to students were discussed. Comment: 17 pages, 2 Figure...|$|R

5|$|The abortion–breast cancer {{hypothesis}} {{has been}} the subject of extensive <b>scientific</b> <b>inquiry,</b> and the scientific community has concluded that abortion does not cause breast cancer and that breast cancer should not be a concern for women who are considering having an abortion. This consensus is supported by major medical bodies, including the World Health Organization, the U.S. National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the German Cancer Research Center, and the Canadian Cancer Society.|$|E
5|$|In {{the thirteenth}} century, <b>scientific</b> <b>inquiry</b> was {{returning}} {{and this was}} manifest through the production of encyclopaedias; those noted for their plant content included a seven volume treatise by Albertus Magnus (c. 1193–1280) a Suabian educated at the University of Padua and tutor to St Thomas Aquinas. It was called De Vegetabilibus (c. 1256 AD) and even though based on original observations and plant descriptions it bore a close resemblance to the earlier Greek, Roman and Arabic herbals. Other accounts of the period include De Proprietatibus Rerum (c. 1230–1240) of English Franciscan monk Bartholomaeus Anglicus {{and a group of}} herbals called Tractatus de Herbis written and pained between 1280 and 1300 by Matthaeus Platearius at the East-West cultural centre of Salerno Spain, the illustrations showing the fine detail of true botanical illustration.|$|E

25|$|While {{it is an}} {{emerging}} and developing field, {{the question of whether}} life exists elsewhere in the universe is a verifiable hypothesis and thus a valid line of <b>scientific</b> <b>inquiry.</b> Though once considered outside the mainstream of <b>scientific</b> <b>inquiry,</b> astrobiology has become a formalized field of study. Planetary scientist David Grinspoon calls astrobiology a field of natural philosophy, grounding speculation on the unknown, in known scientific theory. NASA's interest in exobiology first began with the development of the U.S. Space Program. In 1959, NASA funded its first exobiology project, and in 1960, NASA founded an Exobiology Program, which is now one of four main elements of NASA's current Astrobiology Program. In 1971, NASA funded the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) to search radio frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum for interstellar communications transmitted by extraterrestrial life outside the Solar System. NASA's Viking missions to Mars, launched in 1976, included three biology experiments designed to look for metabolism of present life on Mars.|$|E

25|$|The {{essence of}} this {{criticism}} is that <b>scientific</b> <b>inquiry</b> depends on valid and consistent construct utilization, and {{that before the}} introduction of the term EI, psychologists had established theoretical distinctions between factors such as abilities and achievements, skills and habits, attitudes and values, and personality traits and emotional states. Thus, some scholars believe that the term EI merges and conflates such accepted concepts and definitions.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{principles}} of relativity {{have been widely}} assumed in most scientific disciplines.

25|$|The {{association}} between breast feeding {{and breast cancer}} has not been clearly determined; some studies have found support for an association while others have not.

25|$|The {{philosophical}} {{underpinnings of}} the scientific revolution were laid out by Francis Bacon, who {{has been called the}} father of empiricism. His works established and popularised inductive methodologies for <b>scientific</b> <b>inquiry,</b> often called the Baconian method, or simply the scientific method. His demand for a planned procedure of investigating all things natural marked a new turn in the rhetorical and theoretical framework for science, much of which still surrounds conceptions of proper methodology today.|$|E
2500|$|Considering {{the rapid}} pace {{at which the}} fields of {{medicine}} and health science are developing, it becomes important to investigate the most proper and/or efficient methodologies for conducting research. On the whole, [...] "the primary concern of the researcher must always be the phenomenon, from which the research question is derived, and only subsequent to this can decisions be made as to the most appropriate research methodology, design, and methods to fulfill {{the purposes of the}} research." [...] This statement on research methodology places the researcher at the forefront of his findings. That is, the researcher becomes the person who makes or breaks his or her <b>scientific</b> <b>inquiries</b> rather than the research itself. Even so, [...] "interpretive research and scholarship are creative processes, and methods and methodology are not always singular, a priori, fixed and unchanging." [...] Therefore, viewpoints on <b>scientific</b> <b>inquiries</b> into healthcare matters [...] "will continue to grow and develop with the creativity and insight of interpretive researchers, as they consider emerging ways of investigating the complex social world." ...|$|R

25|$|Logical {{analysis}} {{shows that there}} are two different kinds of statements; one kind includes statements reducible to simpler statements about the empirically given; the other kind includes statements which cannot be reduced to statements about experience and thus they are devoid of meaning.

Hence many philosophical problems are rejected as pseudo-problems which arise from logical mistakes, while others are re-interpreted as empirical statements and thus become the subject of <b>scientific</b> <b>inquiries.</b>|$|R
