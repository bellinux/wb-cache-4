5|$|Then as now, Madagascar was an island, having {{separated}} from the Indian subcontinent less than 20 million years earlier. It was drifting northwards but still 10–15° more southerly in latitude than it is today. The prevailing climate of the time was semi-arid, with pronounced seasonality in temperature and rainfall. Majungasaurus inhabited a coastal flood plain cut by many sandy river channels. Strong geological evidence suggests the occurrence of periodic debris flows through these channels {{at the beginning of}} the wet season, burying the carcasses of organisms killed during the preceding dry season and providing for their exceptional preservation as fossils. Sea levels in the area were rising throughout the Maastrichtian, and would continue to do <b>so</b> <b>into</b> the Paleocene Epoch, so Majungasaurus may have roamed coastal environments like tidal flats as well. The neighboring Berivotra Formation represents the contemporaneous marine environment.|$|E
5|$|Lesnar's next {{opponent}} was Big Show and Heyman {{was convinced}} {{more than anyone}} that Lesnar could not win, trying {{to talk him out}} of defending the title. Lesnar refused and defended the title against Show at Survivor Series on November 17, Lesnar performed an F-5 on Show, but Heyman pulled the referee out of the ring, voiding the pinfall. This allowed Show to chokeslam Lesnar on a steel chair to win the title. This loss was Lesnar's first pinfall loss in WWE and led Lesnar to turn into a fan favorite. Following Survivor Series, Heyman made it clear that Lesnar would not get a rematch, and had snuck a special clause saying <b>so</b> <b>into</b> his contract. In order to gain his revenge on Big Show and Heyman, Lesnar interfered in his first title defense, which came against Kurt Angle the next month at Armageddon on December 15, where Lesnar executed the F-5 on Big Show, which enabled Angle to pin him and win the title. On the following episode of SmackDown!, however, Angle introduced Heyman as his manager and, despite promising Lesnar a title shot earlier in the evening, declared that Lesnar still would not get it. Lesnar's rivalry with Heyman and Big Show resumed, which culminated in a match at the Royal Rumble in January 2003 with the winner being placed into the Royal Rumble later in the evening. On January 19, Lesnar would defeat Show and entered the Royal Rumble match as the No. 29 entry, the second to last competitor to enter the match. He eliminated Matt Hardy and The World's Greatest Tag Team, which was composed of Charlie Haas and his former OVW teammate Shelton Benjamin, who were mentored by Angle. Lesnar would then eliminate The Undertaker last and win the Royal Rumble, which guaranteed him a title match at WrestleMania XIX. After the Royal Rumble, Lesnar and Chris Benoit defeated Angle, Haas and Benjamin at No Way Out on February 23. During the match at WrestleMania XIX on March 30, Lesnar botched a shooting star press, a move he had done numerous times in developmental matches, and jammed his head and neck. This stunned Lesnar and forced Angle and Lesnar to improvise the finish of the match – a pinfall by Lesnar that allowed him to win his second WWE Championship. Lesnar was diagnosed with a concussion from the botched shooting star press.|$|E

Its music also incorporates funk, rock, theatre, and pop styles. Music journalists categorized the record as jazz-rock, baroque pop, and psychedelic R. John Murph of JazzTimes magazine said the music {{could be better}} characterized as art pop than jazz. Axelrod, who had produced bebop albums before working for Capitol, asserted that jazz {{played a crucial role}} in the music: [...] "For years, all I did was jazz.

In an interview with Klap Magazine, Lo said, [...] "'Love Ballad' is actually supposed to be a way of telling the one I love I'd do anything for him. He's worth the pain.

[...] Columbia Records considered bringing in an outside producer for the album and had early talks with RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan. However, Hill was adamant about writing, arranging, and producing the album herself: [...] "It would have been more difficult to articulate to other people. Hey, it's my album. Who can tell my story better than me?" [...] She recalled Ruffhouse Records executive Chris Swartz ensuring her artistic freedom while recording the album: [...] "I had total control of the album.

Shelton believed that writing his own music had [...] "been a great channel {{for him to}} vent and celebrate his tumultuous year". Rolling Stone stated that Shelton and Stefani [...] " [...] gush about their relationship in the press too much, as they [...] to keep some semblance of privacy. Instead, they wrote a song about it." [...] Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly claimed that [...] "Go Ahead and Break My Heart" [...] served as the parent album's [...] "gossipy framing" [...] for [...] "offer a simultaneous spit-in-the-face and [...] to their exes". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic agreed, finding Shelton [...] "embracing his {{new lease on life}} with renewed vigor and a new a love", who Erlewine later claimed was Stefani. The lyrics of the recording delve on Stefani's insecurities in a relationship that [...] "will likely have its shares of ups and downs": [...] "I'm so scared, I don't know what to do". Additionally, she explains in the lyrics how the two artists met: [...] "I never ever meant to get <b>so</b> <b>into</b> you / Thought I was using you just to get me through" [...] and [...] "You know I'm broken, I don't trust anymore / Last thing I needed was to fall in love".|$|E

[...] The 100-year-old Rose gives Lovett information regarding the [...] "Heart of the Ocean" [...] after he discovers a nude drawing of her in the wreck. She tells the story of her time aboard the ship, mentioning Jack {{for the first time since}} the sinking. At 87, Stuart had to be made up to look older for the role. Of casting Stuart, Cameron stated, [...] "My casting director found her. She was sent out on a mission to find retired actresses from the Golden Age of the thirties and forties." [...] Cameron said that he did not know who Stuart was, and Fay Wray was also considered for the role. [...] "But [...] was just <b>so</b> <b>into</b> it, and so lucid, and had such a great spirit.

[...] "I saw this joie de vivre in both of them, that I thought the audience would be able to make that cognitive leap that it's the same person."

500|$|The album's {{recording}} sessions {{took place}} from July 1993 to September 1993 at Bad Animals Studio in Seattle, Washington, as according to Cornell [...] "there {{was never a}} decent studio in Seattle and now there's one with a Neve console, so it seemed obvious to use it". Bad Animals' resident engineer Adam Kasper, {{who went on to}} produce Soundgarden's following albums, assisted Beinhorn on the recording process. Soundgarden took the approach of recording one song at a time. The drum and bass parts were recorded first for each song, and then Cornell and Thayil would lay down their parts over top. Cornell said that getting to know Beinhorn contributed to the length of time Soundgarden spent working on the album. The band spent time experimenting with different drum and guitar sounds, as well as utilizing techniques such as layering, resulting in an expansive production sound. Cornell said, [...] "Michael Beinhorn was <b>so</b> <b>into</b> sounds. He was so, almost, anal about it, that it took the piss out of us a lot of the time... By the time you get the sounds that you want to record the song, you're sick and tired of playing it." [...] Beinhorn tried to add many of his preferred musicians to mold the band's sound, in what Billboard described as [...] "weaning the band from brute force, giving it the impetus to invest in a more subtle power". For instance, prior to recording the vocals of [...] "Black Hole Sun", Beinhorn made Cornell listen to Frank Sinatra.|$|E
