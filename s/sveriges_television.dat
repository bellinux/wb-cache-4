40|$|In {{this study}} we have {{examined}} how {{men and women are}} heard on <b>Sveriges</b> <b>Televisions</b> program Debatt. Debatt broadcast on Sveriges Televison which is a public service broadcaster. Through the use of a quantitative content analysis and a dialogical approach, we have documented how many men and women who speak, how they speak, how long they have the word and the subjects they will be heard in, in the program Debatt. We have investigated the ten last broadcast programs from the fallseason 2011. Every program is 45 minutes long and contains from two to three discussiontopics each time.   By categorizing our survey and enter the result in four different tables, we found that the majority, 63 %, of those that are heard are men. One of our main points in the survey is how men and women get to speak. The men often got the word by interrupting while the women waited for a permission, from the TV host, to speak.   Our results show that men are given more space than women in the program Debatt, which is a public arena for discussion, and we believe that it can contribute to a problem of democracy. ...|$|R
40|$|SVT Nordnytt is <b>Sveriges</b> <b>Televisions</b> (Swedish television) {{regional}} {{news program}} in northern Sweden. The {{purpose of this}} essay was {{to find out how}} the news value has been done, how the news broadcasting looked from a semiotic perspective, and how the broadcasts have been working on the TV as a news media, based on SVT Nordnytts broadcasts on weekdays at 21 : 45. First, we used a qualitative content analysis to answer the question of how the news value has been done and how the broadcasts works on the TV as a media. Then, we used a qualitative analysis from a semiotic perspective, in which we analyzed some of the newscasts from a connotative and denotative perspective. We did this to find out how the broadcasts looked from a semiotic perspective. What we discovered was that the newsroom at SVT Nordnytt values news about politics mostly and that they follow the traditional news values that we have highlighted in this essay. They also reach its audience by identification, but that can be improved. From a semiotic perspective, and the formula for news values, we also know that the broadcasts are working, on the TV as a media. We also discovered that some of the news limited to certain cultural collectives understanding. From what we can tell from the news values and the semiotic perspective, the broadcasts work well on TV as news medium. Validerat; 20140115 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R
