Furthermore, some distributions deliberately include only free software. , over four hundred Linux distributions are actively developed, with about a dozen distributions being most popular for general-purpose use.|$|E

Visitors sign up and create their own <b>specific</b> <b>user</b> account first, listing some personal information, before receiving detailed information about what is available in their area.

2500|$|Registration agencies, {{appointed}} by the IDF, provide services to DOI registrants: they allocate DOI prefixes, register DOI names, and provide the necessary infrastructure to allow registrants to declare and maintain metadata and state data. Registration agencies are also expected to actively promote the widespread adoption of the DOI system, {{to cooperate with the}} IDF {{in the development of the}} DOI system as a whole, and to provide services on behalf of their <b>specific</b> <b>user</b> community. A list of current RAs is maintained by the International DOI Foundation. [...] The IDF is recognized as one of the federated registrars for the Handle System by the DONA Foundation (of which the IDF is a board member), and is responsible for assigning Handle System prefixes under the top-level 10 prefix.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} <b>user</b> <b>specific</b> request redirection for personalizing {{responses to}} user requests in Content Delivery Networks (CDN). <b>User</b> <b>specific</b> request redirection {{refers to the}} process of redirecting user requests to a server on the content delivery network based on <b>user</b> <b>specific</b> information carried in the user request. Current redirection schemes in CDNs are either based on the authoritative DNS model or the URL rewrite model. The authoritative DNS model is not flexible to support <b>user</b> <b>specific</b> redirection as <b>user</b> <b>specific</b> information is not available to the DNS server; the URL rewrite model cannot support <b>user</b> <b>specific</b> redirection in practice because of the cost of on-the-fly URL rewrites required on a per user request basis. We discuss a technique that allows for flexible <b>user</b> <b>specific</b> request redirection. The technique is simple enough to be implemented at wire-speed in a switch...|$|R
