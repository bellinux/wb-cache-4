40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{instances of}} <b>swearing</b> in live television broadcasts. While some cable television shows routinely involve <b>swearing</b> without censorship and recorded shows may include <b>swearing</b> “bleeped out,” our {{interest is in}} instances of <b>swearing</b> in contexts where <b>swearing</b> is prohibited. We look at live interviews and panel debates where <b>swearing</b> is clearly noticed and reacted to strongly — and in all cases retracted or apologized for in some way. The examples we examine thus involve a participant visibly moving outside the normative limits of the interaction, and as such reveal the boundaries that serve as organizational structures for the interactions. Drawing on Goffman’s work on gaffes and slips and ethnomethodological conversation analysis, the paper explores how <b>swearing</b> is treated by the participants as a practical concern, and how <b>swearing</b> and its management implicates the identities and relationships of the participants and the specific context of the interaction. We discuss how <b>swearing</b> in live broadcasts reveals the limits of authenticity within informal, conversational interviews and debates...|$|R

In order to analyze swearwords which emerge within the movie, sociolinguistic approach is employed by the researcher. This research used descriptive qualitativemethod in order to describe the findings of <b>swearing</b> phenomena and the discussion deeply. Moreover, quantitative method wasalso employed to support {{the interpretation of the}} data by displaying fixed percentages in numerical form. The data were in the form of utterances uttered by the two main characters, Vincent Vega and Butch Coolidge, while the contexts of the data were the dialogues between them which contain swearwords.

The primary instrument of this research was the researcher,supported by the data sheet as the secondary instrument. The trustworthiness of the data was gainedby triangulation. The results of this research are stated as follows. Firstly, five types of <b>swearing</b> uttered by the main characters in Pulp Fictionare dysphemistic, abusive, idiomatic, emphatic, and cathartic <b>swearing.</b> From sixty three data found in the movie, emphatic <b>swearing</b> becomes the most frequently used type of <b>swearing.</b> Emphatic <b>swearing</b> is mostly used by the main characters because it is considered as mild <b>swearing</b> in which it is not really provoking the listeners while hear it. Moreover, emphatic <b>swearing</b> is used in order to emphasize the statement of the main characters. The least frequently used type of <b>swearing</b> is abusive <b>swearing.</b> Abusive <b>swearing</b> becomes the least used <b>swearing</b> uttered by the main characters since employing it is considered as inefficient in which it totally intimidates or downgrades the pride of the listeners. Secondly, three reasons for <b>swearing</b> are found in the movie, i. e. psychological motives, social motives, and linguistic motives. Social motives become the most frequently used reason for <b>swearing</b> since mostly the main characters employ swearwords triggered by the people in their surroundings. Psychological motives become the least motive used by the main characters since their use only occurs when the characters employ swearwords for themselves.
