5000|$|General Electric {{constructed}} the first 60 E44s (4400-4459) using Ignitron rectifiers, {{and the final}} six units (4460-4465) with air-cooled silicon diode rectifiers. GE subsequently upgraded 22 of the units (a few at a time) to an E44a designation, boasting upgraded traction motors and <b>silicon</b> <b>rectifier</b> packages for an output of 5,000 horsepower. The 22 E44a's were numbered 4438-4459; the E44a program was terminated in 1970 due to the Penn Central bankruptcy. Conrail subsequently swapped out the Ignitrons {{in all of the}} remaining units for silicon diodes in the late 1970s and early 1980s, in-house and without any horsepower upgrades. In 1980, GE took E44a 4453 in hand for rebuilding with upgraded electronics and uprating to 6,000 horsepower. Made redundant by Conrail's discontinuance of electrified freight operations, the rebuilt 4453 was briefly tested on the Northeast Corridor in 1984 by GE, who then scrapped the unit several years later after salvaging the newer components.|$|E

40|$|International audienceNanosecond pulsed {{electric}} {{fields on}} the order of hundreds of volts per centimeter have shown an ability to alter the structure and functions of biological cells. The effects are dependent on the electric pulse parameters. In order to establish dose-effect relationships, generators that can produce powerful pulses with adjustable duration, amplitude and shape are needed but still unusual. In this paper, we present a robust and flexible generator built on the frozen wave generator concept that can output pulses up to 13. 1 kV and with duration in the nanosecond and subnanosecond ranges. High-voltage <b>silicon</b> <b>rectifier</b> diodes sealed in a semi-translucent glass package and embedded in a coaxial line are used as switch elements.

25|$|Once common until {{replaced}} by more compact and less costly <b>silicon</b> solid-state <b>rectifiers</b> in the 1970s, these units used stacks of oxide-coated metal plates and {{took advantage of}} the semiconductor properties of selenium or copper oxide. While selenium rectifiers were lighter in weight and used less power than comparable vacuum tube rectifiers, they had the disadvantage of finite life expectancy, increasing resistance with age, and were only suitable to use at low frequencies. Both selenium and copper oxide rectifiers have somewhat better tolerance of momentary voltage transients than <b>silicon</b> <b>rectifiers.</b>|$|R

For maximum purity, uniformity and material characteristic stability, neutron transmutation n-type doped float zone silicon is used. The design features a hexagonal chip for maximum area utilization of space available in the DO- 8 diode package, PIN diffused junction structure with deep diffused D(+) anode and a shallow high concentration n(+) cathode. With the high temperature glass passivated positive bevel mesa junction termination, the achieved blocking voltage is close to the theoretical limit of the starting material. Gold diffusion is used to control the lifetime and the resulting effect on switching speed and forward voltage tradeoff. For solder reflow assembly, trimetal (Al-Ti-Ni) contacts are used. The required major device electrical characteristics were achieved. Due to the tradeoff nature of forward voltage drop and reverse recovery time, a compromise was reached for these values...|$|E
