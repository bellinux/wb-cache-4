40|$|Abstract. Due {{to adopt}} manual startup <b>standby</b> {{generator}} <b>set</b> in society,operating personnel can't immediately start the <b>standby</b> generator <b>set</b> after the power failure occurs. Aimed at this problem,a scheme of the <b>standby</b> generator <b>set</b> smartphone {{remote control system}} based on Android was proposed. Firstly,the hardware platform of system was introduced and overall remote control system was designed. Based on this, the application software was developed by Android SDK,which was consisted of four modules,The realization of functionality and interface of every module were analyzed in detail. The research {{results indicate that the}} system is easy operation, friendly interface,and has good stability and availability...|$|R

50|$|Next, the offshore-lift-platform {{could pick}} up the upper storeys which were still stored at Kiel (Fig. 6) to join them with the tower-shaft in the North Sea. Under {{favourable}} weather conditions the upper storeys were placed {{on top of the}} tower without complications (Fig. 7). Now, the completing works such as installation of the optics including the corresponding blinds and the installation of the <b>standby</b> <b>sets</b> were implemented. The power supply of the lighthouse demanded special attention. A 6 kV cable was run from the “Robbenplate” lighthouse (Fig. 1) towards “Alte Weser”, jetted in using a special device (“Einspuelstiefel”, Fig. 8) and threaded into the tower through a protective cable conduit. In addition, measures had to be taken to adopt the same cable for the planned “Tegeler Plate” lighthouse (see below). The foundation of the building was safeguarded with stone ballast poured down on bush mats against rinsing and water erosion. In 1964 the light of “Alte Weser” lighthouse went into service (Fig. 9). In 1972 the four keepers were displaced when the lighthouse became automated.|$|R
50|$|A {{three-phase}} generator can {{be driven by}} a single-phase motor. This motor-generator combination can provide a frequency changer function as well as phase conversion, but requires two machines with all their expenses and losses. The motor-generator method can also form an uninterruptible power supply when {{used in conjunction with}} a large flywheel and a battery-powered DC motor for really constant power, a <b>standby</b> generator <b>set</b> gives more frequency drop until standby generator kicks in.|$|R

Terrestrial microwave links, cellular telephone sites, fibre optic apparatus and satellite communications facilities also have standby battery systems, {{which may be}} large enough to occupy a separate room in the building. In normal operation power from the local commercial utility operates telecommunication equipment, and batteries provide power if the normal supply is interrupted. These can be sized for the expected full duration of an interruption, or may be required only to provide power while a <b>standby</b> generator <b>set</b> or other emergency power supply is started.|$|R

40|$|Diesel {{engine is}} a {{preferred}} power source {{that is used}} for power plant and major source for inland transportation. Diesel engine power plants are preferred where power has to be generated in small quantity or used as <b>standby</b> <b>sets,</b> which are required for commercial use. The uses of diesel engine can cause pollutants such as damage ozone layer, enhance green house effect and produce acid rain because of the production Particulate Matter x, and PM emission. However, the uses of biodiesel can produce NO emission. The emulsified biodiesel is the fuel, which can solve the NO X x emissions. Emulsified biodiesel is combination of water and biodiesel with present of addition of surfactant. The objective {{in this study is}} to find out the optimum formulation and method to produce the highest emulsion stability of emulsified biodiesel. The study scope are study the optimum method of production, effect of the water and biodiesel contain, variation volume Span 80 and Tween 80, variation mixing speed, variation mixing time and types of biodiesel to the stability of emulsified biodiesel. Emulsified biodiesel produce by using the Mechanical Stir Machine and form the emulsified biodiesel types O/W phase. The biodiesel are produce from the palm oil. The volume of biodiesel, water and surfactant are measure by using syringe. From the experiment the uses of 95 % of biodiesel and 5 % of water can produce highest stability emulsion because the present of high volume of biodiesel fuel. The most suitable mixing time and mixing speed are 15 minutes and 700 rpm. The optimum volume Span 80 and Tween 80 are 0. 7 ml and 1. 5 ml. Both of surfactant are lipophilic and hypophlilic. The lipophile are function for absorb oil phase and hydrophilic absorb water phase. Both of the surfactant determine by the Hypophilic Lipophilic Balance...|$|R

50|$|After the First World War, McLaren built a cable-ploughing windlass, {{initially}} {{powered by}} a Dorman petrol engine but a diesel engine was sought. In 1926 the company entered into {{an agreement with the}} German Company Benz to manufacture diesel engines. These were the first automotive-type diesel engines produced in volume in Britain, and as a result were in the forefront of the use of diesel engines for road, rail, and agricultural purposes. Examples include the first diesel-powered railway locomotive, built by Hudswell Clarke in Leeds and {{powered by a}} McLaren-built diesel. The first diesel-powered commercial vehicles in Britain were made by Richard Garrett & Sons of Leiston in 1928, and Kerr Stuart of Stoke-on-Trent, again powered by McLaren-built diesels. In addition, McLaren built Britain's first diesel-powered road roller in 1927 using their own engine. A complete range of diesel engines was designed up to around 400 hp and these were very widely used for industrial applications. One particularly successful use was in <b>standby</b> power <b>sets.</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceDisaster {{recovery}} {{planning and}} securing business processes against outtakes have been essential parts {{of running a}} company for decades. As IT systems became more important, and especially since more and more revenue is generated over the Internet, securing the IT systems that support the business processes against outages is essential. Using fully operational standby sites with periodically updated standby systems is a well-known approach to prepare against disasters. Setting up and maintaining a second datacenter is, however, expensive. In this work, we present Cloud Standby, a warm <b>standby</b> approach for <b>setting</b> up and updating a standby system in the Cloud. We describe the architecture of Cloud Standby and its methods for deploying and updating the standby system. We show that by using Cloud Standby the recovery time and long-term costs of disaster recovery can significantly be reduced...|$|R
50|$|The Maybach Diesel (MD) engines {{produced}} by BSEL included 16 basic engines in the range, which covered powers from 380 to 3,000 horsepower, and includes 4- and 6-cylinder in-line units, and 8, 12 and 16 V units. {{each of these}} were pressure-charged, with or without intercooling. They were used with hydraulic transmission systems, in the Type 4 locos in which two MD650 engines of 1,152 bhp each, hauling the expresses of the Western Region of British Railways - e.g. the Bristolian and the Cornish Riviera - several hundred more orders were placed by British Rail.(Ref TJ102). The MD engines were widely used in base load, intermittent and <b>standby</b> electricity generating <b>sets,</b> and were transported by rail up to the nominal 1200 kW size for a complete generator set. They were also employed in oil rigs and pumping sets.(Ref TJ151/2).|$|R
