Growth velocities thus determined as a function of <b>solution</b> <b>supersaturation</b> were further interpreted using established deterministic models. From analyses of crystal-growth velocities, {{it was found that the}} mode of crystal growth varies with respect to increasing <b>solution</b> <b>supersaturation,</b> possibly owing to kinetic roughening. To verify further the hypothesis of kinetic roughening, crystal growth at the molecular level was examined using atomic force microscopy (AFM).

At the lowest supersaturation, the growth behavior was mainly the advancement of the initial step edges and filling in of the etch pits formed in the water before the BaSO 4 solution was injected. For <b>solutions</b> with higher <b>supersaturation,</b> the growth behavior was characterized by the advance of the and [010] half-layer steps with two different advance rates {{and the formation of}} growth spirals with a rhombic to bow-shaped form and sector-shaped two-dimensional (2 D) nuclei. The advance rates of the initial steps and the two steps of 2 D nuclei were proportional to the SI. In contrast, the advance rates of the parallel steps with extremely short step spacing on growth spirals were proportional to SI 2, indicating that the lateral growth rates of growth spirals were directly proportional to the step separations. This dependence of the advance rate of every step on the growth spirals on the step separations predicts that the growth rates along the [001] direction of the growth spirals were proportional to SI 2 for lower supersaturations and to SI for higher supersaturations. The nucleation and growth rates of the 2 D nuclei increased sharply for higher supersaturations using exponential functions. Using these kinetic equations, we predicted a critical supersaturation (SI ≈ 4. 3) at which the main growth mechanism of the (001) face would change from a spiral growth to a 2 D nucleation growth mechanism: therefore, the morphology of bulk crystals would change...|$|R

Equally, the rate generation of solution cloudiness was reduced by over 3 -fold for the highest HPMC concentration tested, with no detectable impact on final product yield. The mechanisms for nucleation delay and growth inhibition by HPMC is unknown; however, a modification of crystal’s shape observed upon the addition of HPMC to the solution suggested it might be related to mass transfer limitations and intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the large HPMC and the small drug molecules.

40|$|Isotopic and {{chemical}} composition of groundwater from wells and springs, and surface {{water from the}} basalt-dominated Axum area (northern Ethiopia) provides evidence for the origin of water and dissolved species. Shallow (depth < 40 m) and deep groundwater are distinguished by both chemical and isotopic composition. Deep groundwater is significantly enriched in dissolved inorganic carbon up to 40 mmol l− 1 and in concentrations of Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Na+ and Si(OH) 4 compared to the shallow type. The δ 2 H and δ 18 O values of all solutions clearly indicate meteoric origin. Shifts from the local meteoric water line are attributed to evaporation of surface and spring water, and to strong water–rock interaction. The δ 13 CDIC values of shallow groundwater between − 12 and − 7 ‰ (VPDB) display the uptake of CO 2 from local soil horizons, whereas δ 13 CDIC of deep groundwater ranges from − 5 to + 1 ‰. Considering open system conditions with respect to gaseous CO 2, δ 13 CDIC = + 1 ‰ of the deep groundwater with highest PCO 2 = 10 − 0. 9 atm yields δ 13 CCO 2 (gas) ≈ − 5 ‰, which {{is close to the}} stable carbon isotopic composition of magmatic CO 2. Accordingly, stable carbon isotope ratios within the above range are referred to individual proportions of CO 2 from soil and magmatic origin. The uptake of magmatic CO 2 results in elevated cations and Si(OH) 4 concentrations. Weathering of local basalts is documented by 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of the groundwater from 0. 7038 to 0. 7059.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} citrate and phosphocitrate ions on the {{spontaneous}} precipitation of magnesium ammonium phosphate hexahydrate (MgNH 4 PO 4 · 6 H 2 O, struvite) at pH 8. 50 and 25 °C was investigated at conditions of constant <b>solution</b> <b>supersaturation.</b> The supersaturated solutions were prepared in synthetic wastewater. The presence of citrate and phosphocitrate {{in the working}} solutions showed reduction of the initial rates of struvite precipitation when compared with solutions in their absence.

The presence of citrate and phosphocitrate inhibited struvite precipitation up to 75 – 80 %. The reduction of precipitation rates was related to additive concentration following an expression suggested by the kinetic Langmuir-type adsorption model.

40|$|Phosphorus precipitated in {{the form}} of {{crystalline}} phosphate salts like struvite (MgNH 4 PO 4. 6 H 2 O) is an attractive and new prospective alternative in phosphorus recovery from wastewaters. Struvite or magnesium ammonium phosphate hexahydrate is a white crystalline salt with prismatic crystals elongated along the c axis, exceeded the 20 μm. Struvite may be used as a slow - released fertilizer because of its relatively low solubility, the low content in heavy metals and the presence of both ammonia and phosphorus which through dissolution become available nutrients to plants. Struvite may be also used either as raw material for the production of phosphorus, contributing towards sustainable development or as fitment for consolidation of poorly consolidated porous media or stabilization of sandy soil areas. A number of studies have been conducted concerning the precipitation of struvite in aqueous media as a method for phosphorus recovery. For the most part, the majority of the published works were conducted either in simple electrolyte solutions or they did not provide information adequate to correlate the thermodynamics of the solutions with kinetics and mechanistic results. The thermodynamic solubility product of struvite was determined log 0 = ? 13. 68 ± 0. 26 sp K once equilibrium had been attained, when undersaturated and supersaturated solutions were allowed to reach equilibrium, at four different ionic strengths values. Accurate determination required consideration of ionic strength effects on the effective ion concentrations and inclusion of all species and formed complexes in the aqueous medium. The calculations were done using the Davies approximation of the Debye-Huckel equation for activity corrections. Struvite was found less soluble than reported in previous references. The prepared synthetic struvite crystals that were used for thermodynamic solubility product determination, as seed crystals at heterogeneous struvite precipitation and for struvite dissolution studies were prismatic, 20 - 30 μm with specific surface area about 10 m 2 ·g- 1. The synthetic prepared struvite crystals showed a negative charge according to electrophoretic mobility measurements in struvite suspension in NaCl and synthetic wastewater solutions. The residence of the struvite crystals at room temperature and average relative humidity 60 % {{for a long period of}} time resulted in partial dehydration of the solid, yielding magnesium ammonium phosphate monohydrate. Precipitation of struvite from supersaturated solutions was carried out in a batch stirred reactor closed to the atmosphere at constant temperature (25 oC). The kinetics of spontaneous precipitation of struvite was investigated in synthetic wastewater solutions at conditions of constant pH and constant <b>solution</b> <b>supersaturation.</b> The constant <b>solution</b> <b>supersaturation</b> method provides reliable and highly reproducible kinetics results at controlled experimental conditions. A combination glass- Ag/AgCl/KCl(sat.) electrode was used for the solution pH measurements and the precipitation control. The extent of struvite precipitation depends on the <b>solution</b> <b>supersaturation</b> with respect to the precipitating solid, the temperature and the presence of foreign ions or substrates in the solution. The supersaturation of the working solutions was adjusted by varying the concentrations of the Mg 2 +, NH 4 + and PO 43 - ions and the pH, maintaining a stoichiometric molar ratio of 1 : 1 : 1 respectively. Initially, the process of spontaneous precipitation of struvite was studied in synthetic wastewater solution at constant pH and constant <b>solution</b> <b>supersaturation.</b> The struvite surface energy was calculated 16 mJ·m- 2 in constant <b>solution</b> <b>supersaturation</b> conditions at 25 oC and pH 8. 50. The induction times, preceding the onset of struvite formation in synthetic wastewater, were inversely proportional to the <b>solution</b> <b>supersaturation</b> and followed the dependence predicted by the classical nucleation theory, suggesting narrow limits of stability of the respective supersaturated solutions. Moreover, the rates of precipitation of struvite increased with supersaturation showed parabolic dependence on the solution relative supersaturation over the range of supersaturations investigated suggesting a surface diffusion controlled mechanism. The experiments at conditions of constant pH-variable supersaturation have shown that when this parameter is controlled a phosphorus recovery corresponding to 60 % of the initially present phosphorus is feasible and 75 % with respect to the solubility of struvite. At conditions of constant supersaturation it is possible to precipitate struvite continuously. The presence of the sulfate ions in excess in solutions has a retarding effect in the initiation of the precipitation process and at corresponding initial rates. ...|$|E

To ensure the batch was non-nucleating the supersaturation was kept below the SNT (secondary nucleation threshold) limit which corresponded to a narrow secondary MSW (metastable zone width). Measurements were made at three temperatures, 10, 25 and 40 °C. The growth rate was linearly proportional to the <b>solution</b> <b>supersaturation</b> σ. Despite the narrow MSW, the initial growth rates were substantial (several μm/min) ...|$|E
40|$|In situ atomic force {{microscopy}} {{has been}} used to study the effect of dissolved cobalt on the growth and dissolution of calcite 10. 4 surfaces. Growth experiments conducted in the presence of various cobalt concentrations revealed that the growth of the first layer proceeds with step growth and is faster than the growth in pure solution. The subsequent growth on the newly formed surfaces is much slower, although the <b>solution</b> <b>supersaturation</b> is kept constant. This difference in the step velocity leads to the temporary reproduction of the original surface topography (template effect). This demonstrates the role of the substrate surface structure in the crystal growth. In situ dissolution experiments conducted in the presence of cobalt revealed that cobalt is sorbed at the negative (acute) kinks leading to the formation of monomolecular semi-triangular etch pits...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This study {{aimed to}} find an {{efficient}} way to recover Sb from the SbCl 5 acid solution obtained by the chloride leaching process of the tin-depleted residue. Sb was recovered in the form of hydrated antimony pentoxide through the hydrolysis process. The effects of hydrolysis ratio and aging time on the Sb recovery process were studied, and the corresponding trends were established. The experimental results show that the amount of the antimony free ions increases with the hydrolysis ratio and aging time. This decreases the concentration quotient of the hydrolysis reaction and thus facilitates the reaction. Product crys-tallinity is affected by the <b>solution</b> <b>supersaturation,</b> which varies at different stages with aging time. As a result, the optimal conditions of recovering Sb correspond to the hydrolysis ratio of 1. 5 and aging time of 7 days with the recovery rate of 97 %...|$|E
30|$|The solvent/antisolvent {{precipitation}} method {{can be used}} {{to prepare}} of azithromycin nanoparticles. The ethanol solvent used to prepare <b>supersaturation</b> <b>solution</b> of drug and Tween® 80 as a stabilizer used to control of particle size distribution of nanodrug. Azithromycin nanoparticles show dissolution rate in water as 3.36 times of raw drug. The lack of variation in structure and purity of nanodrug are confirmed by similarity in IR spectra, XRD pattern, MS spectra and retention time in HPLC of raw and nano-azithromycin. The obtained particle size distribution shows that the precipitated nano-azithromycin has a particle size of about 200 – 450  nm.|$|R
40|$|The {{growth of}} {{fructose}} crystals from aqueous ethanolic solutions was studied using a 1 -L seeded batch crystallizer. The growth kinetics {{were found to}} linearly depend on the relative supersaturation of the crystallizing tautomer (beta-D-fructopyranose). The growth-rate constant increased slightly with increasing temperature and increasing solvent ethanol content. The growth rates are lower than those for aqueous <b>solutions</b> of comparable <b>supersaturations.</b> Fructose displays significant growth-rate dispersion (q = 0. 35) when crystallized from aqueous ethanolic solutions. The growth-rate dispersion is independent of solvent composition and {{temperature within the range}} studied, although it is slightly higher than is seen in crystallization from aqueous solutions...|$|R
40|$|Several recent {{papers have}} {{described}} the existence of stable nanobubbles in bulk, which is surprising given that the high curvature of these bubbles is expected to place such bubbles under a high pressure and therefore lead to rapid dissolution. Here, we investigate the possible existence of nanobubbles in mixtures of water plus an organic solvent using both static and dynamic light scattering and infrared spectroscopy. The mixing of solvents was designed to introduce nanobubbles into bulk <b>solution</b> via <b>supersaturation</b> of the <b>solution.</b> The solutions scatter light {{for a long period}} (days) after mixing, which is consistent with the formation of nanoscale objects, but we show that these scattering objects originate from water-insoluble impurities in the organic solvents. Our results are inconsistent with the presence of gas nanobubbles in bulk solution: Degassing the solutions, either before or after mixing, has a minimal effect on the scattering, and purification of the organic solvent before mixing reduces the scattering after mixing. Therefore, previous reports of nanobubbles based on scattering experiments should be reconsidered with the hypothesis that the scattering objects are not actually gaseous...|$|R
