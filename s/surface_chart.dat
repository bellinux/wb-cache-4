40|$|The {{propagation}} of seismic waves in inhomogenious media is influenced mainly by the reflection/transmission process at seismic boundaries and by attenuation inside the layers. Small scale (in {{relation to the}} profile length) variations of mean seismic amplitude level are frequently observed in onshore exploration for oil. Detailed investigations relating the cause of diminishing are unknown. Starting with {{the hypothesis that the}} described effect relates to near surface inhomogeneities a new technique was developed. It provides information for the interpretation of amplitudes and frequencies of deep seismic soundings. As for the changed amplitude level, some 'dynamic' parameter have been calculated from the spectra of the data and put into a <b>surface</b> <b>chart.</b> Colour coding leads to special arrangements of rows and columns. A crossing of equal coloured rows and columns at zero offset position in the <b>surface</b> <b>chart</b> means that there is a good agreement between the subsurface conditions of shots and receiver at the same profile position, respectively. Searching for crosses means searching for positions on the profile where the transmission conditions are disturbed in relation to geophones and source points. Applications of this new technique have been performed successfully with model data and with parameters life f_m_a_x, bandwidth, mean amplitude and energy. A careful and thorough analysis of vibrator reflection data shows that there has been an unknown normalization before correlation. Therefore this data has been excluded from further amplitude investigations. The method developed is a contribution to the interpretation of deep seismic reflection data. Its potential consists in a compressed representation of information from the subsurface. That can be used to correct for amplitude changes which otherwise are interpreted as crustal effects. (orig.)

40|$|Shift meteorologists are {{supposed}} to understand the weather situation and {{have to make a}} forecast that is consistent with the actual situation. To get grip on the weather situation in most of the weather rooms the forecaster starts an analysis of the weather by looking at surface observations. Drawing surface charts is the second activity and hereby isobars, (Norwegian) fronts and troughs are the most important features. Filling in weather symbols will be the finishing touch of the <b>surface</b> <b>chart.</b> To get a more 3 D-picture of the weather radiosondes are looked at and every 6 hours higher level isolines are analysed. Since the middle of 2000 the approach at the KNMI is different and from this time satellite images are the starting point for forecasters to analyse the weather situation. The meteorologists try to recognise the cloud patterns in these images by using the knowledge of conceptual models. Cloud tops and cloud patterns seen by satellites, are the fingerprints of physical processes in the troposphere. Conceptual models describe the physical processes trough clouds phenomena, physical parameters, life cycles and weather events. The thinking of a forecaster in terms of conceptual models is a way to get a 3 D- or even 4 D-mental weather picture. (See in this respect: “Manual of Synoptic satellite Meteorology Conceptual Models ” supported by EUMETSAT). A Regional Satrep (abbreviation of Satellite report) is a satellite image overlayed with the names of the conceptual models. The trajectories for the very short-range forecast period, up to 18 hours, determine the area of interest (region).
