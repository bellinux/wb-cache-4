40|$|AbstractCorundum-type Ti 2 O 3 {{has been}} {{investigated}} over {{the last half century}} because it shows unusual insulator–metal (I-M) transition over a broad temperature range (420 – 550 K). In this work, we successfully synthesized Ti 2 O 3 nanoparticles (20, 70, 300 nm in size) by the low-temperature reduction between precursors of rutile-type TiO 2 and the reductant CaH 2, in a non-topotactic manner. The reaction time required for obtaining the reduced phase increases with increasing the particle size. Synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction and electron microscopy studies reveal that the symmetry of all the present samples remains {{the same as that of}} bulk samples. However, the particle-size reduction results in three important features compared with bulk <b>samples</b> <b>as</b> <b>follows,</b> (i) color shift from dark brown to bluish black, (ii) anisotropic volume contraction involving the shrinkage of Ti–Ti bonds in the ab plane and along the c axis, (iii) reduction of the I-M transition temperature from 420 K to 350 K.

40|$|We {{investigated}} HIV- 1 diversity {{by means}} of heteroduplex mobility assay (HMA) genotyping. We studied 199 samples from patients originating from 26 countries and living in France. The HMA successfully genotyped 182 (91 %) of these <b>samples,</b> <b>as</b> <b>follows</b> : 77 (42 %) subtype A, 57 (31 %) subtype B, 5 (3 %) subtype C, 5 (3 %) subtype D, 8 (4 %) subtype E, 22 (12 %) subtype F, 5 (3 %) subtype G, and 3 (2 %) subtype H. We {{were not able to}} genotype 12 samples {{by means of}} the HMA. These latter strains were sequenced, and phylogenetic analyses revealed that they were highly divergent subtype A-, D-, or G-related strains. Eight (of 12) subtype D strains were indeterminate by HMA, owing to the broad intrasubtype diversity, suggesting that new reference subtype D plasmids are required, as previously proposed. Thirty-seven strains belonging to the different subtypes were sequenced, and the results showed perfect concordance with the HMA results. Interlaboratory quality controls confirmed the reliability of the HMA for HIV- 1 subtyping, despite the extensive viral variability. However, plasmid selection must be continuously revised to cover viral diversification. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

MATERIALS AND METHODS: After analysis of motility, concentration, strict morphology and functional integrity of membranes, sperm was divided into two aliquots of 0. 5 mL each and frozen in TyB-G medium. Samples were thawed at room temperature (25 ± 2 º C) for 25 minutes (slow thaw) or in a water bath at 75 º C for 20 seconds followed by water bath at 37 º C for 3 minutes (rapid thaw). After thawing, motility, strict morphology and functional integrity of membranes were evaluated by a blinded investigator. The results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation for parametric variables and analyzed using Student's t-test. Data with unpaired non-parametric variables were expressed as median (interquartile range) and analyzed by the Mann-Whitney test. Wilcoxon test was used to analyze non-parametric paired variables. RESULTS: There {{was no significant difference between}} techniques for total and progressive motility, percentage of normal morphological forms, hypoosmotic swelling test. CONCLUSIONS: Although the rapid thawing protocol was completed in a shorter time (three minutes and 20 seconds versus 25 minutes, respectively), it wasn't harmful since both techniques showed comparable spermatozoa recovery.

A 100 -nm-thick ITO film was then evaporated by an electron beam evaporator as a transparent conducting layer. Subsequently, a mesa with an area of 8 mil[*]×[*] 16 mil was defined by using standard photolithography and dry etching. The samples were annealed at 500 °C in N 2 ambient for 20  min to increase the transparency of the ITO layer, after which the transparency increased from 90 % to 98 % at the wavelength of 460  nm. Finally, patterned Cr/Pt/Au layer was deposited as n- and p-electrodes, and the LED samples with chip size of 9 mil[*]×[*] 17 mil were obtained. Current-voltage and light output power measurements were performed using the FitTech IPT 6000 LED chip/wafer probing and testing system (Fittech Co., Ltd., Taichung, Taiwan).|$|R
