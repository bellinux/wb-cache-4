The primary thought in the present field advances are computerizations, power utilization, and expense adequacy. Automation is implied for the decrease of labor as the human has gotten to be excessively occupied and even incapable, making it impossible to discover time to switch the lights. Presently a day’s everybody are mindful of the availability of limited power sources like coal, biomass, and hydro and so on. Unnecessary wastage of power in the <b>street</b> <b>lights</b> is one of the noticeable power loss. Two sensors viz.

40|$|Street {{lighting}} systems {{have contributed to}} undesirable local government expenditure, electricity peak loads, and greenhouse gas emissions. However, inadequate information on the benefits from energy efficiency improvements has given street {{lighting systems}} a lower priority in national energy efficiency policy. This paper estimates the national benefits arising from energy efficiency improvements on street lighting systems based on a pilot project in Jakarta city and energy audits in other three cities. The energy efficiency actions considered in the audits are the installation of power meters on every panel in street lighting systems and the replacement of old, inefficient armatures with high-efficiency armatures that are integrated with the dimming schemes featured in <b>smart</b> <b>street</b> <b>lighting</b> technology. The results show that electricity consumption reduction potential from energy efficiency improvements can reach 2. 1 Terra Watts hours annually. This is equivalent to energy costs of USD 177. 4 million, a USD 46. 8 million energy subsidy saving, and a 2. 4 million ton CO emission reduction. These findings can provide policymakers with important inputs while undertaking a social cost-benefit analysis of energy efficiency improvements in street lighting systems. However, achieving the potential benefits requires an active participation from investors or the Energy Service Company (ESCO) since local governments generally have limited budgets to implement these actions...|$|E

40|$|The {{goal of the}} Internet of Things (IoT) is to {{transform}} any thing around us, such as a trash can or a <b>street</b> <b>light,</b> into a <b>smart</b> thing. A smart thing has the ability of sensing, processing, communicating and/or actuating. In order to achieve {{the goal of a}} smart IoT application, such as minimizing waste transportation costs or reducing energy consumption, the smart things in the application scenario must cooperate with each other without a centralized control. Inspired by known approaches to design swarm of cooperative and autonomous robots, we modeled our smart things based on the embodied cognition concept. Each smart thing is a physical agent with a body composed of a microcontroller, sensors and actuators, and a brain that is represented by an artificial neural network. This type of agent is commonly called an embodied agent. The behavior of these embodied agents is autonomously configured through an evolutionary algorithm that is triggered according to the application performance. To illustrate, we have designed three homogeneous prototypes for <b>smart</b> <b>street</b> <b>lights</b> based on an evolved network.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{bachelor}} thesis is to examine how LED <b>street</b> <b>lights</b> and a <b>smart</b> <b>street</b> <b>light</b> control system can reduce the energy consumption, costs and in extension the CO 2 equivalents in a geographically delimited area. In 2015 the municipality of Sala installed LED armatures connected to a smart control system in the whole municipality. The smart control system enables for instance adjustment of the light intensity at specific times {{during the day and}} a supervision of the <b>street</b> <b>light</b> network. The LED lights high efficiency and the possibility to lower the intensity of the light reduced the energy consumption of the <b>street</b> <b>lights</b> in Sala with 77. 8 %. LED lights have a longer life time compared to traditional <b>street</b> <b>lights,</b> which reduces the maintenance cost and the cost for purchasing new armatures. In this report the project in Sala is evaluated and the concept is used to investigate the advantages for a similar project in Uppsala municipality. The research goal is to develop a general model that examines the energy-, economic- and environmental savings when installing LED lights and a smart control system. One third of the armatures in Uppsala municipality have already been replaced with LED, therefore the simulations and calculations only includes the two thirds left. The results show that Uppsala municipality annually saves 79. 2 % in energy and CO 2 equivalents with a system like this and the economic savings during the life time of the armature is 182 MSEK, and the pay-off time is 6. 9 years. A sensitivity analysis is carried out to verify the economic results by altering the electricity price. The analysis shows that the system used in Uppsala today is more sensitive to a varied electricity price than when a smart control system is installed. ...|$|R
40|$|Smart cities take {{advantage}} of recent ICT developments to provide added value to existing public services and improve {{quality of life for}} the citizens. The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm makes the Internet more pervasive where objects equipped with computing, storage and sensing capabilities are interconnected with communication technologies. Because of the widespread diffusion of IoT devices, applying the IoT paradigm to smart cities is an excellent solution to build sustainable Information and Communication Technology (ICT) platforms. Having citizens involved in the process through mobile crowdsensing (MCS) techniques augments capabilities of these ICT platforms without additional costs. For proper operation, MCS systems require the contribution from a large number of participants. Simulations are therefore a candidate tool to assess the performance of MCS systems. In this paper, we illustrate the design of CrowdSenSim, a simulator for mobile crowdsensing. CrowdSenSim is designed specifically for realistic urban environments and smart cities services.

30|$|Context-aware {{computing}} {{is becoming}} increasingly {{a key component of}} the infrastructure of smart sustainable cities (e.g. [5, 6, 11, 97] and future smart cities (e.g. [98]). Having access to context information in smart sustainable city applications {{plays a key role in}} supporting decision-making processes pertaining to sustainability (e.g. [1, 5, 6, 11]). As one of the prerequisites technologies for enabling ICT of the new wave of computing and for realizing the ICT visions of pervasive computing, context awareness aims to ‘support human action, interaction, and communication in various ways wherever and whenever needed’ ([19], p. 1) by enabling sensorily and computationally augmented urban environments to provide the most efficient services to citizens and intelligent support to urban actors within a variety of settings (e.g. [5, 6]). Entailing a set of advanced computational functionalities, context-aware applications are able to, by relying on context knowledge, control over processes and automate operative tools as well as provide services and support decision-making needs, thereby exhibiting intelligent behavior. In short, context awareness technology is associated with control, automation, optimization, and management, as well as with the adaptation of services. The system behavior’s adaptation is based either on pre-programmed heuristics or real-time reasoning capabilities. The purpose of machine learning and reasoning is to monitor the behaviors of urban systems and citizens and the changes in their environment using sensors of many types to generate inferences (high-abstractions of contexts) based on reasoning mechanisms, and then use physical actors (actuators) or application actions to react and pre-act accordingly in ways that are more constructive in terms of enhancing urban operations, functions, and services in line with the goals of sustainable development. The widespread adoption of diverse sensors within cities provides interactions through opportunistic and people-centric sensing [99, 100]. In this regard, context-aware applications can monitor what is happening in urban environments, analyze, interpret, and respond to them in a variety of ways—be it in relation to <b>smart</b> energy, <b>smart</b> <b>street</b> <b>lights,</b> <b>smart</b> traffic, smart transport, smart mobility, smart education, smart healthcare, or smart safety—across several spatial and temporal scales (e.g. [4]). It {{is becoming increasingly}} evident that smart urban environments based on context-aware technologies—especially within smarter cities as future forms of smart cities, namely ambient cities, sentient cities, ubiquitous cities, Internet-of-everything, and real-time cities (e.g. [2, 5, 9, 10, 98 – 105]; Kyriazis et al. 106)—which can support sustainable urban living in various ways through intelligent service provision and decision support, will be commonplace in the near future.|$|R
