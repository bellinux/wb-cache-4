5|$|A new student, Hilary van Doren, {{joins the}} school's Dance {{department}} and seduces Leroy. Bruno and Mr. Shorofsky debate {{the merits of}} traditional orchestras versus synthesized instruments. Bruno's father plays his music (the title song) outside the school, inspiring the student body to dance in the streets. As an acting exercise, the <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> to divulge a painful memory. Montgomery discusses discovering his homosexuality, while coming {{out in front of}} his classmates; Doris relates her humiliation at being forced by her stage mother to sing at a child's birthday party; and Ralph tells of learning about the death of his idol Freddie Prinze. Miss Berg drops Lisa from the Dance program, and after seemingly considering suicide in a New York City Subway station, Lisa drops her dance clothes on the subway tracks and decides to join the Drama department.|$|E
25|$|Westside is HISD's Magnet School for Integrated Technology. The program allows {{students}} to look at technology from one of five aspects: Fine Arts, Business, Media Relations, Applied Science/Health Science, and Computing Sciences. During the first year, all Magnet students take a technology survey course, a modular course that introduces them to the five strands of the program. The second year, <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> to choose {{one of the five}} strands on which to focus their elective courses.|$|E
25|$|In school, <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> to {{complete}} many tasks and activities, {{many of which}} involve handwriting. Many children with CP {{have the capacity to}} learn and write in the school environment. However, students with CP may find it difficult {{to keep up with the}} handwriting demands of school and their writing may be difficult to read. In addition, writing may take longer and require greater effort on the student's part. Factors linked to handwriting include postural stability, sensory and perceptual abilities of the hand, and writing tool pressure.|$|E

3000|$|The ROSE {{survey was}} {{conducted}} in Abu Dhabi in 2015. The ROSE questionnaire contains about 250 items, including 108 statements on students’ interests in science education, and {{is divided into three}} sections. On a four-point scale (from not interested to very interested) for each statement, <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> to indicate their response by ticking the appropriate box. The general question for each of the statements had the heading of “What I want to learn about? How interested are you in learning about the following?” For the out-of-school activities, a total of 61 statements were presented. On a four-point scale (disagree to agree), <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> to mark the appropriate box for “how often have you done this outside school?” There were 18 statements on environmental challenges. On a four-point scale (disagree to agree), <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> to state their opinion regarding “to what extent {{do you agree with the}} following statements about problems with the environment?” For the “opinion about science,” there <b>were</b> 16 statements. <b>Students</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> “to what extent do you agree with the following statements?” There were 16 statements on my science class. On a four-point scale (disagree to agree), <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> to “to what extent do you agree with the following statement about the science that you may have had at school?” Finally, for the expected career choices, there were 26 statements.

25|$|Pimsleur {{language}} learning system {{is based on}} the research of and model programs developed by American language teacher Paul Pimsleur. It involves recorded 30-minute lessons to be done daily, with each lesson typically featuring a dialog, revision, and new material. <b>Students</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> to translate phrases into the target language, and occasionally to respond in the target language to lines spoken in the target language. The instruction starts in the student's language but gradually changes to the target language. Several all-audio programs now exist to teach various languages using the Pimsleur Method. The syllabus is the same in all languages.|$|E
25|$|One early {{application}} of knapsack algorithms {{was in the}} construction and scoring of tests in which the test-takers have a choice as to which questions they answer. For small examples it is a fairly simple process to provide the test-takers with such a choice. For example, if an exam contains 12 questions each worth 10 points, the test-taker need only answer 10 questions to achieve a maximum possible score of 100 points. However, on tests with a heterogeneous distribution of point valuesi.e. different questions are worth different point values {{it is more difficult}} to provide choices. Feuerman and Weiss proposed a system in which students are given a heterogeneous test with a total of 125 possible points. The <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> to answer all of the questions {{to the best of their}} abilities. Of the possible subsets of problems whose total point values add up to 100, a knapsack algorithm would determine which subset gives each student the highest possible score.|$|E
500|$|All {{students}} must sign a [...] "Statement of Faith" [...] before they enroll, affirming belief {{in what the}} college considers core Christian doctrines. For example, <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> to acknowledge [...] "Satan exists as a personal, malevolent being who acts as tempter and accuser, for whom Hell, the place of eternal punishment, was prepared, where all who die outside of Christ shall be confined in conscious torment for eternity.... Man is by nature sinful and is inherently in need of salvation, which is exclusively found by faith alone in Jesus Christ and His shed blood.... Christ's death provides substitutionary atonement for our sins." [...] The college professes non-denominational Christian beliefs, informed by Evangelical Protestantism.|$|E

500|$|The program {{usually has}} 40–50 first-year students, 15 {{advanced}} students, and 15 counselors. Students are admitted by application—which includes {{a set of}} mathematical questions—or by showing [...] "a great eagerness to learn". First-year students meet daily for lectures in elementary number theory and thrice weekly for problem seminars. They are encouraged to think like scientists and devise their own proofs and conjectures to the problems posed, which occupies most of their free time. Ross designed the daily problem sets, and many questions contain his signature directions: [...] "Prove or disprove and salvage if possible." [...] Successful <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> to return as students and counselors in future summers. Returning students revisit the daily lectures and help first-years with their questions. They also can take advanced courses such as combinatorics and graduate seminars. Student problem sets are graded daily by the live-in counselors.|$|E
500|$|The school's {{philosophy}} {{is that students}} learn best at their own pace. The original curriculum was a cross between [...] "instruction and home life". The Albany Free School has no firm schedule and does not grade students. The day begins at 8:15a.m. and <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> {{what they want to}} do each day. Students are grouped by age and present their own plan for each day. They pursue various projects including writing, filmmaking, and studying language or history. The school also offers structured math and reading classes for those who want it. Classes tend to have five to seven students per teacher and the school's teacher–student relationships are close. Teachers report a relative ease in holding students accountable to their stated plans. In 2006, the school had ten teachers, four interns, and a number of parent volunteers for 58 students between the ages of three and fourteen (pre-K to eighth grade). The school has a [...] "Living and Learning" [...] program between 10 a.m. and noon, followed by lunch, which the students make themselves as part of the program. The children play sports until their 3 p.m. class and school ends at 4 p.m.|$|E
500|$|The {{subjective}} events {{allow students}} more creativity than the objective events. The speech event {{is divided into}} prepared and impromptu sections. A three-and-a-half to four-minute long prepared speech is delivered. The student is then given one minute to read three prompts and deliver a one-and-a-half to two-minute impromptu speech. Example prompts have included: [...] "It {{has been said about}} our modern times that, 'Invention is the mother of necessity.' Please discuss.", [...] "Math has been described as the universal language. Discuss." [...] and [...] "Why is light, light and dark, dark?" [...] In the interview, the <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> a wide variety of questions in a formal environment. Questions range from: [...] "Who is your role model?" [...] to [...] "How would you alert someone that their zipper is down?" [...] In both the speech and interview, the competitor is not allowed to reveal his or her school or hometown to ensure neutrality by the judges. In the essay event, students are given 50 minutes to write an essay responding to one of three prompts derived from the language and literature or the Super Quiz curriculum.|$|E
5000|$|The Challenge progressed in two stages. In {{the first}} stage, {{training}} dataset of simulated sensor data, {{along with the}} underlying ground-truth data, <b>was</b> provided to <b>students.</b> This allowed them to train their algorithm. In the next stage, a test dataset consisting of only sensor data <b>was</b> provided to <b>students.</b> <b>Students</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> to run their trained algorithm on this dataset & submit results. In addition, <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> to submit a description of their algorithm and code.|$|R
50|$|The <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> {{about an}} uneventful night during their week, where they {{experienced}} uninterrupted sleep, uninfluenced by alcohol or other drugs, and inability to recall dreams. While the <b>students</b> <b>were</b> placed under hypnosis, {{they were told}} that they had heard a loud noise at 4 a.m. After hypnosis, the <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> if they remembered hearing a loud noise at 4 a.m. 28% of the informed students and 44% of the uninformed students claimed that they had heard a loud noise at 4 a.m.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the third}} {{developmental}} stage (14 {{years old and}} up), children in Waldorf programs are supposed to learn through their own thinking and judgment. <b>Students</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> to understand abstract material and expected to have sufficient foundation and maturity to form conclusions using their own judgment. [...] The intention of the third stage is to [...] "imbue children with {{a sense that the}} world is true".|$|E
2500|$|Either {{of these}} systems {{can be used in}} {{standardized}} testing. [...] What is important to standardized testing is whether all <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> equivalent questions, under equivalent circumstances, and graded equally. [...] In a standardized test, if a given answer is correct for one student, it is correct for all students. [...] Graders do not accept an answer as good enough for one student but reject the same answer as inadequate for another student.|$|E
2500|$|Students {{sometimes}} resist critical pedagogy. Student {{resistance to}} critical pedagogy {{can be attributed}} to a variety of reasons. Student objections may be due to ideological reasons, religious or moral convictions, fear of criticism, or discomfort with controversial issues. Kristen Seas argues: [...] "Resistance in this context thus occurs when <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> to shift not only their perspectives, but also their subjectivities as they accept or reject assumptions that contribute to the pedagogical arguments being constructed." [...] Karen Kopelson asserts that resistance to new information or ideologies, introduced in the classroom, is a natural response to persuasive messages that are unfamiliar.|$|E

2500|$|Although not a requirement, some {{students}} may submit their written reports (ranging from 15-25 pages) to the faculty committee {{in order to be}} considered for publication in the university's research journals. Publication in the UROP Undergraduate Research Journal is known to be extremely competitive. In many cases, <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> to submit numerous drafts to the faculty committee for review, only to find out that their papers are later denied publication. In the past, a mere 5% of all submissions were accepted for publication in the journal.

2500|$|Significant underreporting {{of sexual}} abuse of boys by {{both women and men}} is {{believed}} to occur due to sex stereotyping, social denial, the minimization of male victimization, and the relative lack of research on sexual abuse of boys. Sexual victimization of boys by their mothers or other female relatives is especially rarely researched or reported. Sexual abuse of girls by their mothers, and other related and/or unrelated adult females is beginning to be researched and reported despite the highly taboo nature of female–female child sex abuse. In studies where <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> about sex offenses, they report higher levels of female sex offenders than found in adult reports. This underreporting has been attributed to cultural denial of female-perpetrated child sex abuse, because [...] "males have been socialized to believe they should be flattered or appreciative of sexual interest from a female." [...] Journalist Cathy Young writes that under-reporting is contributed to by the difficulty of people, including jurors, in seeing a male as a [...] "true victim".|$|E
2500|$|Most {{veterinary}} {{schools do}} not allow students to engage in [...] "species specialization", and students {{must be able to}} treat a broad range of species. However, most veterinary programs allow students to take elective courses which will enable them to specialize at graduation. [...] Veterinary schools in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States engage in [...] "tracking", and <b>students</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> which branch of veterinary medicine they intend to practice (such as companion-animal, bovine, equine, food-supply, avian, wildlife, and public-health). Although tracking is controversial, about 60 percent of US and Canadian veterinary schools engage in full or partial tracking of students and there are calls for full tracking by some North American veterinary-medical-education organizations. It is argued that enhanced tracking should be linked to [...] "limited licensure" [...] of veterinarians to practice only in the species (or specialty) in which they were trained. Although very few veterinary schools require students to enroll in an internship or residency upon graduation, internships and residencies are often required for veterinarians seeking board certification in Canada, Europe and the US.|$|E
