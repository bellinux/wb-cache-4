50|$|In days of yore, {{the then}} farming village of Gries knew only the occupations that any place thus {{characterized}} needed, namely the crafts: blacksmith, cabinetmaker, tailor, shoemaker. There {{was also an}} inn. Then the Lebecksmühle (mill) became part of Gries; this was named the “Wolfsmühle” in 1712 after it was inherited by a Mr. Wolf. It {{is likely that the}} mill is much older, although an exact age cannot be determined. Later in the 18th century, the mill passed to the family Lebeck, who gave it the name that is still customary today. As early as the late 19th century, the mill was shut down; it later served as a countryside pub. Shops that did not necessarily {{have anything to do with}} agriculture began arising in the early 20th century: a rooﬁng business, a butcher’s <b>shop,</b> <b>painting</b> businesses, hairdresser’s shops, grocer’s shops, a bakery, a bicycle and motorcycle shop and more inns. As mentioned above, people from Gries were then already commuting to work in the Saarland. Among the bigger businesses that arose in the village itself in the 1920s and 1930s, though, were a few diamond-cutting shops on the pattern of the diamond-cutting village of Brücken, which also enjoyed a brief second boom after the Second World War, but this did not last beyond 1950. The shops and crafts that were once customary in all villages have largely disappeared. Other businesses have taken their place, and today, the following shops, craft workshops and institutions are to be found in Gries: a business dealing in heating system and bathroom installation, a flooring business, a rooﬁng business, an excavation business, a painter’s workshop, a tile layer’s workshop, an architecture ofﬁce, an institution for foot care and a Heilpraktiker. The inn industry has gained new importance with Gries’s emergence as a tourism centre.|$|E

40|$|The Office of Sustainability has {{occupied}} {{the house at}} 503 Regents for approximately four months. The space is used to house the Big Red Bikes mechanic shop and program, and other programs and activities. Eight students work in the Office of Sustainability in various roles including bike mechanic, student assistant, four PowerSave Interns, a student “handy-man” who works on various physical improvements, and a student that is completing his Honors Thesis on the project. Much {{of the past four}} months have been spent setting up the bike <b>shop,</b> <b>painting,</b> installation of walkway and way finding sign, and otherwise improving the interior aesthetics, and developing a project plan and budget, outlined below. The first order of business is to collect baseline data on the house in its current condition. Thermal imaging and a blower door test will be conducted by Faculty member Bob Choate and his engineering students in the month of February. The results will provide measurable baseline data that can be compared to results of the same test after project completion. The thermal images and door blower test results and photos will be used in educational and publicity materials. As soon as internet is installed, a Smart meter will be installed to collect utility usage data. Internet and phone connection Status – in process Internet and phone connection, or lack thereof, have been a source of frustration since occupying our new space, however we are making do and, having found solutions to several of the challenges, expect internet and phone service within two weeks. WKU IT provided quote for approximately 20, 000 for this installation, but Facilities Management was able to conduct some of the work to bring the cost down to approximately 11, 500. Charlie Jones has offered to fund this project through the Department of Facilities Management as infrastructure improvement. The IT department also provided funding support for the project. “Smart” meter installation Status – pending internet connectivity A meter for 503 Regents must provide the following functions: ability to interface with Metasys to display real-time use on JCI Kiosk dashboard, ability to provide high-resolution data on energy and water use, ability to read and communicate solar energy production from photovoltaic panels. This meter will be similar in type to the meters currently used in campus buildings and can be provided by WKU Energy Management. The meter must be installed by an electrician. Although the appropriate meter has been identified and is available, it is non-functional without a hard-wired internet connection. In the meantime, I am receiving monthly utility usage data from BGMU.
