Surface quenching following <b>surface</b> <b>induction</b> heating is simulated taking into account all the following features of the process: (i) electromagnetic and thermal fields (ii) phase transformation (iii) residual stress field resulting from all the process. The fatigue strength of the specimens was simulated by using Crossland and Dang-Van criteria; the field of the residual stresses, the fatigue characteristics of both the untreated material and the treated layer (martensite) are considered.

Comparing the <b>surface</b> <b>induction</b> of CD 83 {{with the}} {{upregulation}} of CD 40, CD 80 and CD 86 during LPS (lipopolysaccharide) -induced DC maturation showed that CD 83 induction occurred more rapidly. Despite {{the lack of}} CD 83 on immature DCs, it was detected in these cells by Western blotting and flow cytometry. Indirect immunofluorescence revealed CD 83 inside immature DCs in perinuclear regions. CD 83 was absent on monocytes and macrophages, but it was detected inside these cells and found to be rapidly surface-expressed upon LPS-induced activation. Whereas CD 83 expression on activated DCs was sustainable, its expression on monocytes and macrophages was transient. Optimal interleukin- 4 co-stimulation during DC generation from monocytes {{was found to be}} essential for stable CD 83 surface expression. CD 83 was detected as 37 and 50  kDa forms in transfected 293 T cells. Macrophages and immature DCs expressed the 37  kDa form, whereas mature DCs predominantly expressed the 50  kDa form. In monocytes, CD 83 was detected as a 22  kDa detergent-insoluble form. The rapid CD 83 <b>surface</b> <b>induction</b> on DCs and macrophages was blocked by brefeldin A, but not by cycloheximide, showing that fresh CD 83 synthesis was not essential.

PNGase F (peptide N-glycosidase F) digestion reduced the 37 and 50  kDa CD 83 forms to 28  kDa.

40|$|Abstract:- The {{main idea}} of this paper {{consists}} in creation of the optimal depth of shell which provides optimal stress distribution in quenched steel parts. For small steel parts optimal quenched layer can be provided by using of low and limited hardenability steels (LH). For big steel parts optimal quenched layer can be provided by use of low alloy steels. Since the LH steel core does not harden significantly, the ductility of the core is also maintained. The same is true when using low alloy steels for manufacturing big steel parts. The grain sizes of LH steels are above ASTM 8. It is shown that {{the high level of}} compressive surface residual stresses and steel superstrengthening phenomenon can eliminate the need for secondary shot peening or <b>surface</b> <b>induction</b> operations. Also carburized alloy steels can be successfully replaced by LH steels to increase service life and decrease cost of materials.

40|$|The {{mucosal route}} of {{vaccination}} {{has attracted a}} great deal of attention recently. Not only is mucosal application of vaccines, for example, orally or intranasally, particularly convenient, it also offers the possibility to induce locally produced and secreted S-IgA antibodies in addition to systemic IgG antibodies. These IgA antibodies are known to play a key role in protection against pathogens that invade the host through mucosal <b>surfaces.</b> <b>Induction</b> of such responses is not readily achieved by currently used vaccination strategies, which generally involve intramuscular or subcutaneous injection with inactivated pathogens or antigens thereof. For the induction of a mucosal immune response, the vaccine needs to be applied locally. However, local vaccination with non-replicating antigens is usually ineffective and may result in tolerance unless a mucosal immunoadjuvant is included. The most potent mucosal immunoadjuvants known to date are probably cholera toxin (CT) and the closely related Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin (LT). Although CT and LT have become standard adjuvants for experimental mucosal vaccines, the intrinsic toxicity has thus far precluded their use as adjuvants for human vaccine formulations.

40|$|This {{research}} work focuses on scale kinetics in real field complex brines using two complementary laboratory techniques; static bulk precipitation tests and dynamic surface deposition capillary cell tests. All experimental results are {{backed up by}} theoretical scale predictions. This study focuses on the barium sulphate system in complex solutions. It explores the effect of temperature (25 °C, 50 °C and 75 °C), and the resulting saturation ratio (SR) of barium species active concentration on the barium sulphate formation. The effect involves both static bulk precipitation and surface deposition using a dynamic flow system. This work systematically shows that the predicted saturation ratios, at different temperatures, {{do not seem to}} control the surface crystallization in a barium sulphate system once heat is applied. At room temperature, the saturation ratio was predicted to be the highest while the observed bulk and <b>surface</b> <b>induction</b> periods are largest. On the other hand, at 75 °C when the saturation ratio was predicted to be the lowest, the observed bulk and surface crystallization induction periods were shortest. The surface morphology of scale crystals is also affected by the saturation ratios resulting from temperature differences rather than the smaller differences in SR due to mixing ratios within each temperature applied. The novelty of this {{research work}} is primarily around the detailed investigation of the surface nucleation/scaling period, and the mechanism of growth. In addition, the barite/scale surface kinetic investigations supported by thermodynamic theoretical calculations and static bulk tests to explain surface kinetics. The advantage of this setup facilitates a uniform development of scale thickness along a test capillary with respect to the differential pressure drop across it. A mathematical relation (Hagen–Poiseuille) which links the average flow velocity in the pipe (Q) to the pressure drop Δp across a circular pipe of length (L) was used. The results show the scale thickness increase rate. In addition to assessing the barium content, this work is also focused on the effect of other different variables (saturation ratio (SR), mixing ratio, temperature, flow rate, residence time, and surface condition) on the scaling kinetics and final crystal surface conformations. As the main precipitate, on stainless steel surface substrate, the effect of free active barium cations was successfully studied across a wide range of saturation ratios using the dynamic flow loop rig. In this regard, the barium content was varied from 0 ppm - 150 ppm through 20 ppm, 50 ppm, 80 ppm and 100 ppm at 75 ᵒC. The <b>surface</b> <b>induction</b> period and the total cell blockage time were used to assess the effect of barium ions in real field brines. The data analysis show that the <b>surface</b> <b>induction</b> time is proportional to barium content (SR); it increases with the increase of barium species activities. The surface growth factor was also found to be proportional to the saturation ratio which results from the increase of barium content in the brine mixture. The figures were used as a reference when similar brine formulation mixtures were used to scale chemically manipulated steel surfaces with a water soluble anti-nucleation phosphonate scale inhibitor called diethylene tri amine penta phosphonic acid (DETPMP). Almost all of the scaled surfaces (resulting from the dynamic tests) were analysed using different surface integration techniques; surface topography and chemical composition using SEM and EDX respectively.

The effectiveness of the copper complex–nitrite–ascorbic acid system for biofilm control was quantified using protein analysis, which showed enhanced biofilm suppression when the copper complex was used in comparison to that with nitrite and ascorbic acid treatment alone. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and LIVE/DEAD staining revealed a reduction in cell surface coverage without a loss of viability with the copper complex and up to 5 mM of nitrite and ascorbic acid, suggesting that the nitric oxide generated from the system inhibits proliferation of the cells on <b>surfaces.</b> <b>Induction</b> of nitric oxide production by the copper complex system also triggered the dispersal of pre-established biofilms.

40|$|Matrilysin, {{a matrix}} metalloproteinase, is {{expressed}} and secreted lumenally by intact mucosal and glandular epithelia throughout the body, suggesting that its regulation and function are shared among tissues. Because matrilysin {{is produced in}} Paneth cells of the murine small intestine, where it participates in innate host defense by activation of prodefensins, we speculated that its expression would be influenced by bacterial exposure. Indeed, acute infection (10 – 90 min) of human colon, bladder, and lung carcinoma cells, primary human tracheal epithelial cells, and human tracheal explants with type 1 –piliated Escherichia coli mediated a marked (25 – 50 -fold) and sustained (> 24 h) induction of matrilysin production.

40|$|When a {{chromatic}} (eg light-blue) annulus {{surrounds the}} central gap of an Ehrenstein figure {{so as to}} connect the inner ends of the radial lines, a striking new lightness effect emerges: the central white disk has both a self-luminous quality (brighter than in the regular Ehrenstein figure) and a surface quality (dense, paste-like). Self-luminous and surface qualities do not ordinarily appear co-extensively: hence, the brightness induction is called anomalous. In experiment 1, subjects separately scaled self-luminous and surface properties, and in experiment 2, brightness was nulled by physically darkening the central gap.
