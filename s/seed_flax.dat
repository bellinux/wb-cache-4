Variables included enzyme or dew retting, fiber or <b>seed</b> <b>flax,</b> enzyme and chelator concentrations, and sequential cleaning steps. In addition {{to differences in}} color with enzyme or dew retting, the variables involved in enzyme retting also contribute to differences in the lightness, redness-greenness, and yellowness-blueness of the resulting fibers. Dew retted fiber flax, as well as <b>seed</b> <b>flax</b> that has weathered during storage prior to enzyme retting, is significantly darker than non-weathered, enzyme retted fiber flax. Painvise comparisons show that lower enzyme concentrations (0. 05 % v/v as commercially supplied) produce redder and yellower fiber samples than those retted with higher (0. 3 % v/v) enzyme levels. Higher chelator levels, (i. e., 50 versus 25 mmol ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) produce redder fibers. Fiber lightness significantly increases with additional cleaning steps.

Unretted straw was decorticated providing a coarse fiber bundle feedstock for enzyme treatments. Enzyme treatments using a bacterial pectinolytic enzyme with lyase activity were conducted in lab-scale reactors. Four fiber specimens were created: no retting, minimal retting, moderate retting, and full retting. Fiber characterization tests: strength, elongation, diameter, metal content, wax content, and pH were conducted with significant differences between fibers. Thermosetting vinyl ester resin was used to produce composite panels via vacuum-assisted infusion. Composite performance was evaluated using fiber bundle pull-out, tensile, impact, and interlaminar shear tests. Composite tests indicate that composite panels are largely unchanged among fiber samples. Variation in composite performance might not be realized due to poor interfacial bonding being of larger impact than the more subtle changes incurred by the enzyme treatment.

Hens were fed diets containing 0 % flax seed (control), 10 % flax <b>seed</b> (<b>flax),</b> 10 % flax seed + 100 IU/kg of vitamin E (flax + α-tocopherol), or 10 % flax seed + 100 mg/kg of buty-lated hydroxytoluene (BHT) (flax + BHT). Fresh eggs collected within 24 h were hard-boiled, coded, and were offered to trained panelists in 4 testing sessions. Sen-sory traits evaluated were aroma, flavor, off-flavor, and overall difference. The trained panelists rated flax, flax + α-tocopherol, and flax + BHT eggs {{to be different}} from control eggs (P 0. 05) between control and flax seed-fed eggs. These results suggest that flax seed when incor-porated at 10 % in the layer diet can produce eggs that are acceptable to untrained panelists and consumers.

Feeding oil seeds had no adverse effects on the Haugh units of eggs at any point of storage. Yolks from the FLAX regimen had the highest color index and those from HOAS the lowest when measured by comparison to the Roach yolk color fan. The Haugh units decreased whereas the yolk color index increased during 6 wk storage. The sensory quality of fresh eggs (stored for less than 2 wk at 4 C) was evaluated in two independent studies using hard-cooked eggs.

40|$|Flavour {{compounds}} in vegetable oils are important constituents {{that influence the}} quality of oils and may have positive or negative characteristics. Their presence or absence {{can be used as}} a marker to identify adulteration of edible oils. In this study, the volatile flavour compounds of selected Macedonian edible oils, including sunflower, pumpkin <b>seed,</b> <b>flax,</b> rapeseed and sesame seeds, were analyzed. For that purpose, a headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) with a PDMS/Carboxen/DVB fibre was used for flavour extraction, followed with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis. In total, 102 flavour compounds were identified belonging to different groups: acids, alcohols, aldehydes, alkanes, alkenes, cyclo alkanes, esters, furans, pyrazines, sulfur compounds and terpenes. Among them, aldehydes presented highest proportion of overall volatiles in rapeseed (76. 8 % of total volatiles), followed by sesame (25 % of total volatiles), pumpkin seed (5. 45 % of total volatiles), flax (2. 5 % of total volatiles) and sunflower oil (0. 95 % of total volatiles).

If GE flax were released commercially, pollen-mediated gene flow will determine in part whether GE flax could coexist without compromising other markets. As a part of pre-commercialization risk assessment, we quantified pollen-mediated gene flow between two cultivars of flax. Field experiments were conducted at four locations during 2006 and 2007 in western Canada using a concentric donor (20 × 20 [*]m) receptor (120 × 120 [*]m) design. Gene flow was detected through the xenia effect of dominant alleles of high α-linolenic acid (ALA; 18 : 3 cisΔ 9, 12, 15) to the low ALA trait. Seeds were harvested from the pollen recipient plots up to a distance of 50 [*]m in eight directions from the pollen donor. High ALA seeds were identified using a thiobarbituric acid test {{and served as a}} marker for gene flow. Binomial distribution and power analysis were used to predict the minimum number of seeds statistically required to detect the frequency of gene flow at specific α (confidence interval) and power (1 −β) values. As a result of the low frequency of gene flow, approximately 4 million seeds were screened to derive accurate quantification. Frequency of gene flow was highest near the source: averaging 0. 0185 at 0. 1 [*]m but declined rapidly with distance, 0. 0013 and 0. 00003 at 3 and 35 [*]m, respectively. Gene flow was reduced to 50 % (O 50) and 90 % (O 90) between 0. 85 to 2. 64 [*]m, and 5. 68 to 17. 56 [*]m, respectively. No gene flow was detected at any site or year > 35 [*]m distance from the pollen source, suggesting that frequency of gene flow was ⩽ 0. 00003 (P= 0. 95).

It is most numerous on the valley floors and in the foothills where man 2 ̆ 7 s development has created an extensive favorable habitat. The linnet is primarily a seed eater and before the introduction of domestic fruits into California probably lived largely on weed seeds. Linnets attack the ripening fruit of the apricot, cherry, peach, pear, nectarine, plum, prune, avocado, grape, apple, fig, strawberry, blackberry, raspberry and many others. They disbud almond, apricot, pear, peach, plum, prune and nectarine. They also attack milo maize, sunflower, lettuce seed, broccoli <b>seed,</b> <b>flax</b> seed, miscellaneous vegetable and flower seeds, ornamental fruits and berries and tomato plantlets. HORNED IARKS Otocoris alpestris, subspecies: Depredations. In certain parts of California the horned lark is a serious crop destroyer. The damage occurs mostly in the interior valleys from Sacramento south to the Imperial Valley and along the coastal strip from San Francisco south to San Diego. Horned larks are given great opportunity for damage by the widespread abundance of cultivated products attractive to them. Among the crops severely damaged are plantlets of lettuce, carrots, beets, spinach, turnips, peas, beans, sugar beets, alfalfa, cantaloupes, watermelons, tomatoes and lettuce. Flower plantlets of any variety in commercial seed plantings are frequently devoured. Damage by horned larks usually begins after the first plants break through {{the surface of the}} soil and it may continue until the plants reach a height of several inches. CROWNED SEHRROWS Zonotrichia species and subspecies: Depredations. Direct opposites as to preference of habitat to the horned larks, crowned sparrows are birds of deep brush, river bottom jungles, dense weed fields, fence rows, brush piles or rubbish heaps. The dense hedges and thick plantings of shrubbery commonly found about many rural and suburban homes are much to their liking. Crop depredations in California by crowned sparrows can be laid to three subspecies—Gambel 2 ̆ 7 s, Nuttall 2 ̆ 7 s and Golden Crown.

40|$|Flax (Linum usitatissimum) fibers {{have the}} {{advantages}} of low density, low cost, and recyclability and are considered as a potential material to reinforce plastic materials. Though Canada {{is one of the}} largest <b>seed</b> <b>flax</b> growing countries in the world, the utilization of flax fibers as reinforcement in composites is not as developed as in Europe. Indeed, in Canada, a large amount of flax straws are left in the fields and burned by farmers each year. Therefore, development of technologies to make use of flax straws for reinforcement in composites and for other purposes has huge benefits to both the material industries and flax farmers in Canada. This thesis presented a study of flax fibers reinforced biocomposites by injection molding through modeling and optimization. The focus of the study was to understand the relationships between the properties of biocomposites and the processing conditions through the experiment and improve the qualities of biocomposites by optimizing the processing conditions. In this thesis, biocomposites were successfully produced by injection molding with a proposed processing scheme. The influence of flax fiber loading and processing conditions, including injection temperature and pressure on the mechanical properties (tensile properties and flexural properties), and water absorption of biocomposites was investigated. The study also experimentally investigated the effect of the processing conditions (fiber content and temperature) on the rheological properties of biocomposites. In order to implement the simulation analysis of injection molding for biocomposites, the Cross-WLF model was employed to obtain the rheological information of biocomposites. Further, a systematic approach on simulation analysis and optimization of injection molding was proposed to minimize the shrinkage and warpage of biocomposites. Several conclusions are drawn from this study: 1) With respect of the influence of the processing conditions on the properties of biocomposites, (a) Fiber content is the most significant impact factor influencing the mechanical properties of biocomposites compared with the other two processing conditions and the tensile properties and flexural properties of biocomposites dreamingly increased with flax fiber content; (b) lower injection temperature led to higher tensile properties and flexural properties; (c) Water absorption of biocomposites was significantly dependent on fiber content and injection temperature; (d) Injection pressure had no significant effect on either mechanical properties or water absorption. 2) In the study on the rheological characteristics, (a) The shear viscosity of biocomposites increased with fiber content, but at very high shear rates (from 5, 000 to 10, 000 S− 1), the shear viscosities of biocomposites with various fiber content (from 0 to 30 %) tended to be the same; (b) The shear viscosity of biocomposites decreased with temperature, and at higher shear rate, all the shear viscosity variations as function of shear rates followed the same rate for different temperatures; (c) At high shear rate, the shear viscosity mostly depended on the shear rate rather than fiber content and temperature; (d) A method was presented to determine the seven parameters of the Cross-WLF model for biocomposites. 3) For minimizing the shrinkage and warpage of injection molded biocomposites, (a) The significant factors on the shrinkage and warpage of biocomposites by injection molding were injection temperature, packing time, and packing pressure; (b) The optimization of the injection molding of biocomposites for reducing the shrinkage and warpage of biocomposites was successful by integrating design of experiment (DOE) and simulation technique. The contribution of this thesis includes: 1) In the field of biocomposites reinforcement, the study has shown a great promise to use flax fibers to enhance the mechanical properties of thermoplastics, in particular an increase of 41. 83 % in tensile strength and an increase of 47. 13 % in flexural strength. In addition, this work has provided a mathematical relationship between the processing condition of injection molding and the mechanical properties of biocomposites, which would be important to control the manufacturing process to reach desired mechanical properties. 2) In the field of optimal design and manufacturing of flax fiber biocomposites, this work has provided: (a) an effective method to determine the parameters in the rheology model of the biocomposites melt, which has been an important step in simulating the process, and this method has a generalized implication to other types of biocomposites; and (b) a systematic approach to optimize the injection molding process for minimizing the shrinkage and warpage of biocomposites, which are the two most important quality issues in biocomposites...|$|E

Date palm pollen (DPP) and <b>flax</b> <b>seed</b> have been used traditionally to improve fertility in Libya. DPP extracts have shown several reproductive beneficial effects. In vivo, studies have revealed the ability of DPP to increase sperm concentrations, ameliorate the testicular toxicity induced by cadmium and lead, raise testosterone, as well as LH and FSH hormone levels. <b>Flax</b> <b>seed</b> phytochemical analysis showed lots of valuable components such as lignans and α linolenic acid to which were attributed its positive health effects like antitumor, antioxidant and protective effects against coronary heart diseases. Moreover, flax lignans have both estrogenic and antiestrogenic potential. This study was aimed at testing the effects of Libyan DPP and <b>flax</b> <b>seed</b> on the Sertoli (TM 4) cell line and human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF - 7) cell line. Different concentrations (0. 01, 0. 1, 1, 10, 100 and 1000 μg/ml) of ethanolic extracts of DPP and <b>flax</b> <b>seed,</b> respectively, were used to assess the morphology of TM 4 and MCF - 7 cells after 24 and 72 hours exposure. Mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity as a marker of cell viability was measured by MTT assay after 24 and 72 hours exposure. Apoptotic effects were assessed by flow cytometeric APO percentage assay. TM 4 cell production of Inhibin - B hormone and GGT enzyme activity under the effects of DPP or <b>flax</b> <b>seed</b> was determined by use of ELISA kits. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) assay were used to detect the effect of DPP or <b>flax</b> <b>seed</b> on TM 4 cell monolayer integrity. Finally the plants potential phytoestrogenic activity was determined by use of E - SCREEN assay in MCF – 7 breast cancer cells. Higher concentrations of DPP significantly increased the activity of mitochondrial dehydrogenase enzyme of TM 4 cells after 24 hours associated with increasing cell number as detected in a microphotograph. <b>Flax</b> <b>seed</b> concentrations less than 100 μg/ml reduced TM 4 cell viability but there were no morphological changes visible after 24 hours. MCF - 7 cells viability was reduced after 24 and 72 hours treatment with DPP and <b>flax</b> <b>seed.</b> DPP concentrations beyond 1 μg/ml significantly raised the TEER of TM 4 monolayer over 72 hours while <b>flax</b> <b>seed</b> treatments caused a significant increase only after 72 hours of exposure. TM 4 cells GGT activity increased significantly after exposure to higher concentrations of DPP and all <b>flax</b> <b>seed</b> concentrations. Significant stimulatory effects of all the concentrations of DPP or <b>flax</b> <b>seed</b> on TM 4 inhibin - B hormone productions have been detected. Apoptotic studies showed no significant changes. E - SCREEN assay resulted in significant reduction in MCF - 7 proliferation rate under the effect of low concentrations of DPP or <b>flax</b> <b>seed.</b> Higher concentrations of the plant extracts, however, stated to increase MCF – 7 cell proliferation, this exerts weak estrogenic activities. In conclusion, the main finding {{of this study is that}} DPP and <b>flax</b> <b>seed</b> showed stimulatory effects on TM 4 cells proliferation. The resistivity of TM 4 cells monolayer which reflect the integrity of blood – testis barrier (BTB) was also significantly increased as well as inhibin - B production and GGT enzyme activity. In addition DPP and <b>flax</b> <b>seed</b> respectively showed inhibitory effects on MCF - 7 cells viability.

This studyfollows the effects of the ovarian hormones deficit in surgical menopause (experimental ovariectomy). The absence of theendogen estrogens disrupts the lipid metabolism and diminishes the antioxidant capacity. Another goal was to evaluatethe lipid profile improved by taking a <b>flax</b> <b>seed</b> diet rich in phytoestrogens. The experiment will be performed on whiterats, females, of the Wistar race. The supplementary diet with <b>flax</b> <b>seeds</b> will be administered to the ovariectomizedgroups {{as well as to the}} control groups. In the case of animals with a hormonal deficit (ovariectomy) we found thepresence of dyslipidemia: hypercholesterolemia and/or hypertriglyceridemia. Supplementing the diet with <b>flax</b> <b>seeds</b> ledto the decreasing of the total seric cholesterol (p> 0. 05) and of the seric triglycerides (p 0. 05), after supplementing the diet with whole <b>flax</b> <b>seeds,</b> which suggests the protection of theendothelium, with the diminishing of the risk of triggering endothelial dysfunction. These results demonstrate thebeneficial effects of phytoestrogens from <b>flax</b> <b>seed</b> on lipid metabolism in experimental menopause...|$|R

40|$|Effects of aqueous {{methanolic}} extract of <b>Flax</b> <b>seeds</b> (Linum usitatissimum) on serum estradiol, progesterone {{and some}} biochemical metabolites in immature female rats were investigated. Thirty six immature female rats {{were divided into}} 3 equal groups. Rats of group A served as controls, while those of groups B and C were given crude extract of <b>Flax</b> <b>seeds</b> orally @ 500 mg/kg and estradiol @ 40 µg/kg body weight, respectively, daily for 14 days. After 7 days, 6 rats from each group were euthanized, while the remaining 6 rats in each group were killed 14 days after treatment. Blood samples were taken for serum biochemical analysis, while ovaries {{were used for the}} determination of ovarian cholesterol contents and histological studies. Body weight of rats given <b>Flax</b> <b>seeds</b> extract was higher (P< 0. 05) compared to control rats and those given estradiol. Serum estradiol, progesterone, total proteins and total cholesterol contents were higher (P< 0. 05) in rats given <b>Flax</b> <b>seeds</b> extract and estradiol compared to controls. The ovarian cholesterol contents were reduced in rats of both treatment groups (P< 0. 05). Serum ALT and AST activities were higher in <b>Flax</b> <b>seeds</b> treated rats compared to control, while it was not so in estradiol treated group. There was no difference in serum urea concentrations among rats of three groups. In conclusion, aqueous methanol extract of <b>Flax</b> <b>seeds</b> increased serum estradiol, progesterone, total proteins, total cholesterol, ALT and AST activity, and decreased ovarian cholesterol levels, while it had no effect on kidney function in immature female rats...|$|R

Choices include almonds (especially when soaked in water overnight and then peeled), hemp seeds, coconuts, pine nuts, walnuts, sesame seeds (til in Nepali), pumpkin <b>seeds</b> and <b>flax</b> <b>seeds.</b> Oils should be of good quality and cold-pressed. Some choices are olive oil, sesame oil and flax oil. Most oils should only be eaten in their raw state, but some oils like ghee, sesame oil, palm oil, and coconut oil can be used in cooking.|$|R

40|$|The {{fatty acid}} {{composition}} and volatile compounds of selected traditional Macedonian edible oils of several varieties, including sunflower <b>seeds,</b> pumpkin <b>seeds,</b> <b>flax</b> <b>seed,</b> rapeseed and sesame seeds, were analysed. The fatty acid (FA) composition {{was determined by}} GC-FID analysis after transesterification into the corresponding methyl esters. α-Linolenic acid (C 18 : 3) was the main unsaturated fatty acid in <b>flax</b> <b>seed</b> oil (56. 2 % of total FA), oleic acid (C 18 : 1) dominated in rapeseed and sesame seed oils (65. 3 and 43 % of total FA, respectively), and linoleic acid (C 18 : 2) was the dominant compound in sunflower and pumpkin seed oils (59. 2 and 59. 5 % of total FA, respectively). The volatile flavour compounds were determined using headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) using a DVB/Carboxen/PDMS fibre, coupled with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). In total 97 volatile compounds were detected revealing a very complex aroma profile of the oils, composed of acids, alcohols, aldehydes, alkanes, alkenes, esters, furans, pyrazines, sulphur compounds and terpenes. Among them, aldehydes presented the highest proportion of the overall volatiles in rapeseed oil (76. 8 % of the total volatiles), followed by sesame seed oil (25 % of the total volatiles), pumpkin seed (5. 45 % of the total volatiles), <b>flax</b> <b>seed</b> oil (2. 5 % of the total volatiles) and sunflower seed oil (0. 95 % of the total volatiles). Terpenes (41 detected) were the dominant compounds in sunflower seed oil and pumpkin seed oil (93. 9 and 87. 8 % of the total terpenes, respectively), followed by <b>flax</b> <b>seed</b> oil (47. 6 % of the total terpenes), sesame seed oil (21. 5 % of the total terpenes) and rapeseed oil (10 % of total the terpenes). Sunflower seed and pumpkin seed oil showed {{the highest number of}} volatile compounds identified, with the highest number of terpenes and esters within the investigated products...|$|R
