The SART is used on conventional and, partly, nonconventional vessels in search and rescue operations at sea. It is also used, to a certain extent, on inland waterways, rivers and lakes.

With regard to their technical characteristics and design requirements, they comply with the regulations of local registers of shipping when fitted to new-build vessels or in case of subsequent installation.

40|$|Since 2010, the University of Cádiz offers {{three new}} degree {{programs}} related to merchant marine officers studies. These three degrees cover {{the training and}} certification of deck officers, marine engineers and radio- electronic officers, clustered under the EINAMAR (Escuela de Ingeniería Marina,Naútica y Radioelectrónica) umbrella. These degrees are designed to provide the students {{not only with the}} proper academic certificate but also with a fully worldwide recognized professional certificate. This is the reason why the studies not only have to fully fulfill the academic quality requirements laid down by ANECA (Agencia Nacional de Evaluación de la Calidad y Acreditación) or DEVA (Dirección de Evaluación y Acreditación – Agencia Andaluza del Conocimiento-) but also with the standard qualifications set up by the International Convention on Standard of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping (STCW 95) for seafarers as amended in 2010 (Manila Amendments). According to this, as far as the students finish successfully their studies, and after an onboard training period, {{they will be able to}} obtain both, the academic and the professional certificates. “Maritime Safety” is a one of the core subjects for these three programs and it has been designed as a transversal subject in such a way that all the students have the same contents and schedule. This subject aims to provide the students with the theoretical and practical training to cope with any situation involving fire prevention and firefighting as well as incident and accident prevention and resolution on board. It also introduces student into the world of contingency planning and evacuation procedures on board, the knowledge of how to use <b>survival</b> <b>crafts</b> and equipment to increase probabilities of survival when abandoning the ship, and the most appropriate techniques and procedures when abandoning the ship and boarding the <b>survival</b> <b>crafts.</b> The main aim of the practical part of the subject is to improve the on board safety and risk awareness and to let the students get used to the most appropriate techniques and procedures as well as the use and maintenance of the protective equipment available on board. To achieve this goal, problem based learning techniques related to real situations on board have been applied. One of the specific practical workshop that have been implemented during the course, deals with the student training level in the use of SCBA (Self-contained reathing apparatus) and other protective equipment as well as orientation and search and rescue techniques within hostile environments with sensorial losses. As these situations can arise on board students must be familiar with them in order to properly face them. The aim of this specific workshop is not only to improve the students’ safety and risk awareness but also to encourage, strengthen and increase other professional and social skills...|$|R

40|$|Operation of manned {{oil and gas}} {{installations}} in arctic locations is complicated and presents new challenges. One of the challenges is to maintain {{the safety of the}} crew, by obtaining adequate lifeboat systems for crew evacuation. This master thesis focuses on different methods for meeting this challenge. The weather and climate conditions in the Arctic are very different from the conditions we find in more southern oceans. Extreme temperatures, winds caused by polar lows, icing and sea ice presents new and difficult challenges which is demanding for the operation of lifeboats. Hazard identification analyses of two types are performed to identify potential hazards of operating existing lifeboats in arctic conditions. These identify the following hazards as the most critical: Freezing of moving davit components Risk of floating pieces of ice occurring in the launching zone for free fall lifeboats Close pack ice present at the time of evacuation Open drift ice or close pack ice present during the initial operational phase Sea spray icing on the lifeboat at sea Open drift ice or close pack ice present in the operational phase Based on the hazard identification analyses, a specification of requirements for arctic lifeboats is established. This specification is intended to supplement, and not replace, the existing regulations and requirements which apply to lifeboats. Based on the specification, alternatives for modification of existing lifeboats are suggested and discussed. The modification alternatives include modifications of launching equipment, hull strengthening and propulsion equipment. However, full compliance with the specification is not believed to be achievable by modifications. Three different concepts for arctic <b>survival</b> <b>crafts</b> are outlined, each intended for a specific set of ice conditions. Concept one is an arctic free fall lifeboat, intended to be launched by free fall in the icefree summer season, and launched by a more conventional method in the ice season. The lifeboat is designed to be able to operate in higher ice concentrations than existing lifeboats are capable of. Concept two is an arctic conventional lifeboat, intended to be launched {{in the same way as}} existing conventional lifeboats. It is designed to operate in very high ice concentrations, by use of Archimedes screws. Concept three is an arctic survival vehicle, designed to operate in continuous ice and very high ice concentrations. Propulsion is provided by twin pair of tracks. In the final part of the thesis, the Arctic Free Fall Lifeboat is developed further. Dimensions, capacities, hull design and features for arctic operation are described. An improved launching arrangement is also described, capable of operating in two different modes depending on the ice concentrations in the area. The thesis concludes that existing lifeboats can be modified to achieve better performance and safety in arctic conditions, but the potential for improvement is limited. To achieve high performance and a high level of safety, arctic lifeboats must be designed and built for this purpose. </p...|$|R

50|$|Many <b>survival</b> games feature <b>crafting</b> systems; by {{combining}} {{two or more}} resources, the player can create a new object, {{which can be used}} for further crafting. This enables gameplay where the player can collect resources to craft new tools that enable them to access better resources that will eventually lead to better tools and weapons. A common example is creation of pick-axes of various levels of hardness: wooden pick-axes allow stone to be mined but not metallic ores; however, a pick-axe made from collected stone can be used to mine these ores. The same concept applies to weapons and armor, with those made out of more-difficult-to-acquire materials providing better offensive and defense bonuses. Often, the crafting system includes durability factors for tools and weapons, so that the tool will break after repeated use. Crafting systems may not give the player the necessary recipes for crafting, requiring this to be learned through experimentation or from game guides.|$|R
