50|$|TRAILER - A <b>special</b> <b>semi-trailer</b> {{truck that}} can only be played in each SPEED TRAX Bonus Game. Because of his very large size and the {{flexibility}} of the hitch between the cab and trailer, he is very tough to drive. The SPEED TRAX Bonus Game featuring TRAILER uses a different camera angle, which can make controlling this vehicle more confusing than the others. It is impossible to damage this vehicle.|$|E
5000|$|The Commander {{is powered}} by the 26.7L Rolls-Royce/Perkins CV12 TCE twin {{turbocharged}} diesel engine that produces approximately [...] and is coupled to an Allison automatic transmission. The Scammell Commander CV12 engine {{is very similar to}} the ones used in the Challenger 1 and 2 main battle tanks but with an increased power output of around 1,200 bhp 895 kW. Designed to tow loads up to 65 tonnes, the Commander tows a <b>special</b> <b>semi-trailer</b> onto which tanks can be tail-loaded using a hydraulic 20-tonne capacity winch. A prominent bonnet houses the vehicle's Perkins (Rolls-Royce) CV 12 TCE V12 and although the Commander {{is powered by}} the Perkins/Rolls-Royce engine, other types were also proposed - one of the prototypes used a Cummins KTA 600 diesel. The cab has provision for up to three or four passengers and there is space for two bunks behind the front seats. Due to the front axle lock angle, the Commander is highly maneuverable and can negotiate a 'T' intersection with only 9.15 meters between the walls.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{establish}} {{the basis for a}} presentation study, whose goal is to approximate the problems and dilemas of <b>special</b> <b>semi-trailer</b> with extensible sidewalls construction to the future consumer. The thesis explains which parts the semitrailer is made of as well as which essentials should be considered when designing the construction itself. The paper partly shows one particular semi-trailer project. On this project the calculation of stabilisation system, solidity analysis of the extensible part frame and the complete visualization of the trailer unit have been completed...|$|E
50|$|With the {{requirements}} of the international shipping industry, the ISO containers (international standard) and non-ISO containers made in China are nearly all exported to other countries. The international market share of China's containers is getting larger and there have been various products released since 1993. The product structure was very simple at the beginning, but now it has various products for special purposes including many cargo containers such as warm-keeping containers, pot containers and dry bulk cargo containers, regional <b>special</b> containers and <b>semi-trailer</b> containers and so on. Altogether it has about 900 types with different sizes which can meet the needs of customers all over the world.|$|R
