500|$|While Vicky {{was close}} with her eldest daughter, this changed {{as the girl}} grew older; {{by the time she}} was two years old, Charlotte had become known as [...] "sweet naughty little Ditta" [...] and would prove to be the most {{difficult}} of the family's eight children. As a young girl, she acted nervously and made frequent displays of agitation, such as pulling at her clothes. An early habit of biting her nails led to preventative measures like the forced wearing of gloves, but any methods only provided temporary relief. Queen Victoria wrote to her daughter, [...] "tell Charlotte I was appalled to hear of her biting her things. Grandmamma does not like naughty little girls". In 1863 the Crown Princess recorded in her diary that Charlotte's [...] "little mind seems almost too active for her body – she is so nervous & sensitive and so quick. Her sleep is not so sound as it should be – and she is so very thin". Charlotte developed violent tantrums, to her mother's displeasure; Vicky described them as [...] "such outbreaks of rage & stubbornness that <b>she</b> <b>screams</b> blue murder". The young girl was also underweight and had a troublesome digestion.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the last}} page of what begun as a light-hearted caper story, all of the {{principal}} characters, {{and some of the}} minor ones, are either dead, among the walking dead, or incarcerated for life.

This play {{would later become}} {{one of her most}} successful and popular performances. Notwithstanding, reviews for the play, and for Russell's performance, were becoming unfavourable by the ninth month of the play's run—the reviewer says of her performance: [...] "If she cares for her future, she will not waste time in spoiling her voice. ...Lacking knowledge and training, <b>she</b> <b>screams</b> in a most unhappy fashion."

2500|$|Alice {{arrives and}} takes the wine, and sees through Annabel's offer almost immediately.

Miriam says she drugged the wine (her own glass having come from a different bottle in the kitchen), and a horrified Annabel watches her push Alice's body through the trapdoor and down the well. Next, she goes through Alice's handbag looking for the letter. It is not there, but her address and keys are, so she persuades Annabel to come with her to get the letter.

2500|$|Daniel Welsh from HuffPost was {{positive}} {{in his review}} of the track. He called it [...] "one {{of the more important}} moments of Joanne, and a welcome relief." [...] Welsh further described [...] "John Wayne" [...] as a stand-out of the album and complimented Gaga's tongue-in-cheek references in the lyrics. Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic believed that the song was an indication of the musical direction the parent album could have gone into, with Gaga's fascination of the Western genre. [...] "When <b>she</b> <b>screams</b> 'go FASTER!' in the song's intro, it's one of the album's few examples of Gaga doing what Gaga got famous for, glorifying the extreme," [...] he added. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine thought that Gaga exudes [...] "swagger" [...] on the song with her [...] "fetishizing" [...] of blue-collar men as [...] "red-state treasure", like how she did on the song [...] "Teeth" [...] from The Fame Monster (2009).|$|E

When Brienne refuses to decide, she and some of her companions are sentenced to be hanged, at which <b>she</b> <b>screams</b> an undisclosed word. The author later revealed that the word was [...] "sword", in response to Catelyn's ultimatum of [...] "Sword or noose", which offered either Brienne's continued service to Catelyn herself, or hanging.|$|E
2500|$|The teen pop newspaper, Go-Set started {{publishing}} in 1966, and in 1968, {{as a guest}} writer, Saddington provided an interview of soul and blues singer, Max Merritt. In March 1969 Saddington was described by The Canberra Timess Garry Raffaele as [...] "by far the best female rhythm and blues singer in the country.

Saddington left the band in May that year prior to any known recordings, the band later shortened their name to Chain and had a hit with [...] "Black and Blue".

[...] In an attempt to uncover the secret of Rose Red, Steve creates a telepathic link between Cathy and Annie, and Cathy begins to engage in automatic writing. Annie begins to draw pictures of boulders striking the house, smashed doors, and broken glass, and soon doors and windows {{all over the house}} are opening and closing violently and glass in the windows shatters. Rocks begin to fall, destroying Mrs. Waterman's car and causing severe damage to Rose Red. Cathy automatically writes [...] "help us" [...] and [...] "open the doors," [...] prompting Annie to unseal the house. [...] Steve, Emery, Cathy, Rachel, and Annie make their escape from Rose Red, but Joyce, now clearly insane, refuses to leave. The group is attacked by the spectre of Ellen Rimbauer, but Annie prevents Ellen from coming after them.

2500|$|Don Giovanni {{revels in}} {{the luxury of}} a great meal, served by Leporello, and musical {{entertainment}} during which the orchestra plays music from popular (at the time) late-18th-century operas: [...] "O quanto in sì bel giubilo" [...] from Vicente Martín y Soler's Una cosa rara (1786), [...] "Come un agnello" [...] from Giuseppe Sarti's Fra i due litiganti il terzo gode (1782) and finally, [...] "Non più andrai" [...] from Mozart's own The Marriage of Figaro (1786). Leporello complains that he is {{sick and tired of}} hearing Mozart's aria everywhere all the time. (Finale [...] "Già la mensa preparata" [...] – [...] "Already the table is prepared"). Donna Elvira enters, saying that she no longer feels resentment against Don Giovanni, only pity for him. ("L'ultima prova dell'amor mio" [...] – [...] "The final proof of my love"). Don Giovanni, surprised, asks what she wants, and she begs him to change his life. Don Giovanni taunts her and then turns away, praising wine and women as the [...] "support and glory of humankind" [...] (sostegno e gloria d'umanità). Hurt and angry, Donna Elvira gives up and leaves. Offstage, <b>she</b> <b>screams</b> in sudden terror. Don Giovanni orders Leporello to see what has upset her; when he does, he also cries out, and runs back into the room, stammering that the statue has appeared as promised. An ominous knocking sounds at the door. Leporello, paralyzed by fear, cannot answer it, so Don Giovanni opens it himself, revealing the statue of the Commendatore. With the rhythmic chords of the overture, now reharmonized with diabolic diminished sevenths accompanying the Commendatore ("Don Giovanni! A cenar teco m'invitasti" [...] – [...] "Don Giovanni! You invited me to dine with you"), the statue offers a last chance to repent, but Don Giovanni adamantly refuses. The statue disappears and Don Giovanni cries out in pain and terror as he is surrounded by a chorus of demons, who carry him down to Hell.
