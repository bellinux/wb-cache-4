5|$|In Eurasia, some {{authorities}} {{distinguish between}} cultivated and wild versions of parsnips by using subspecies P. s. sylvestris for the latter, or even elevating it to species status as Pastinaca sylvestris.

The great diversity in tree fruits and seeds reflects the many different ways that tree species have evolved to disperse their offspring.|$|E
5|$|The Admiralty {{initially}} {{specified that}} the ship should be capable of , and have {{a full set of}} sails for worldwide cruising range.

The esophagus may also be imaged using a flexible camera inserted into the esophagus, in a procedure called an endoscopy. If an endoscopy is used on the stomach, the camera will also have to pass through the esophagus. During an endoscopy, a biopsy may be taken. If cancer of the esophagus is being investigated, other methods, including a CT scan, may also be used.|$|E
5|$|Basil cultivars vary {{in several}} ways. Visually, the <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> {{of the leaves}} varies greatly, from the large lettuce-like leaves of the Mammoth basil and Lettuce leaf basil to the tiny leaves of the Dwarf bush basil. More practically, the {{fragrance}} of the basil varies due to the varying types and quantities of essential oils contained in the plants. The most important are 1,8 cineol, linalool, citral, methyl chavicol (estragole), eugenol and methyl cinnamate, although hardly any basil contains all of these in any significant amount.|$|E

5|$|Cyptotrama asprata (alternatively spelled aspratum), {{commonly}} known as the golden-scruffy collybia, is a saprobic species of mushroom in the family Physalacriaceae. Widely distributed in tropical regions of the world, it is characterized by the bright orange to yellow cap that in young specimens is covered with tufts of fibrils resembling small spikes. This fungus has had a varied taxonomical history, having been placed in fourteen genera before finally settling in Cyptotrama. This species is differentiated from several other similar members of genus Cyptotrama by variations in cap color, and spore <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being the}} most {{distinctive}} feature of Deinonychus, the shape and curvature of the sickle claw varies between specimens. The type specimen described by Ostrom in 1969 has a strongly curved sickle claw, while a newer specimen described in 1976 had a claw with much weaker curvature, more similar in profile with the 'normal' claws on the remaining toes. Ostrom suggested that this difference in the <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> of the sickle claws {{could be due to}} individual, sexual, or age-related variation, but admitted he could not be sure.|$|E

5|$|Mycena maculata bears some {{resemblance}} to M.inclinata, but is only associated with decaying hardwood logs and stumps, and {{is found in}} eastern North America, and sometimes on oak on the West Coast. In age, it develops reddish spots on the gills that are not seen in M.inclinata. M.inclinata is often confused with the edible M.galericulata, a common species that is variable in cap color, <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape.</b> M.galericulata typically has a bluntly conical cap that is dull gray-brown, and white to grayish veins that have numerous cross-veins. M.polygramma has a ridged stem that is bluish-gray.|$|E

Most bovids bear 30 to 32 teeth.|$|E
