50|$|Some birds {{described}} by Pelzeln are the orange-breasted thornbird, the spot-winged antbird, the red-legged tinamou, the white-throated tinamou, the <b>short-billed</b> <b>leaftosser,</b> the yellow-margined flatbill and the New Zealand rockwren.|$|E
50|$|The <b>short-billed</b> <b>leaftosser</b> (Sclerurus rufigularis) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Furnariidae. It is found in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela. Its natural habitat is {{subtropical}} or tropical moist lowland forests.|$|E
50|$|The <b>short-billed</b> <b>leaftosser</b> (S. rufigularis) {{is widely}} {{sympatric}} in the Amazonas basin. It looks almost alike {{but it has}} a shorter bill and its song, while structured similarly, changes in pitch several times through its course rather than simply descending. It is also an inhabitant of terra firme forest near rivers, whereas the tawny-throated leaftosser prefers hilly terrain.|$|E
50|$|The <b>short-billed</b> <b>leaftosser</b> is {{a stocky}} bird {{with a short}} tail. It reaches a length of about 15 cm and {{compared}} to other leaftossers its beak is short, being 15 mm rather than 25 mm long. Otherwise, it is similar in appearance to the tawny-throated leaftosser (Sclerurus mexicanus) being dark brown with a buffy-ochre throat and rufous breast. It may have a faint reddish-brown eye-stripe and pale brown eye-ring.|$|E
50|$|Leaftossers are small, plump, ground-dwelling {{birds with}} dark plumage and short legs and tails. The sexes {{are similar in}} the black-tailed leaftosser, and it grows to a length of about 18 cm. The beak is long and straight, and the lower {{mandible}} is turned up at its tip. The head and upper {{parts of the body}} are a deep brown, the rump is chestnut-brown and the tail black. The throat is white, the feathers being edged with brown which gives the throat a scaled appearance, {{and the rest of the}} underparts are dark brown. Some other species of leaftossers overlap its range but it can be distinguished by the white throat; the <b>short-billed</b> <b>leaftosser</b> (Sclerurus rufigularis) has a short beak and reddish throat; the tawny-throated leaftosser (Sclerurus mexicanus) has a downwardly-curved beak and cinnamon throat; and the grey-throated leaftosser (Sclerurus albigularis) has a straight beak and a pale grey throat bordered by a cinnamon band.|$|E
50|$|The {{tawny-throated leaftosser}} is {{considered}} to be the sister species of the <b>short-billed</b> <b>leaftosser</b> (S. rufigularis). It might actually contain two species which are sympatric by range (though not by altitude) between eastern Panama and northern Colombia; the birds between Meta and Santander Departments (Colombia), including a population in the Serranía de las Quinchas discovered only on January 20, 2006, have not been identified as to subspecies yet. As regards scientific names, S. mexicanus would refer to the lowland birds, while the name of the Andean ones (which ironically would not include the subspecies andinus, essentially a lowland bird despite its name) would be S. obscurior. The status of the isolated Mata Atlântica population is also unclear; it might represent yet another species, which would be named S. bahiae, but it has been very little studied. A study of vocalizations published in 2017 proposes that as many as five species may be contained within S. mexicanus sensu stricto.|$|E
