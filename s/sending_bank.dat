50|$|Formally {{known as}} the Federal Reserve Wire Network, Fedwire is a {{real-time}} gross settlement funds transfer system operated by the United States Federal Reserve Banks that enables financial institutions to electronically transfer funds between its more than 9,289 participants (as of March 19, 2009). Transfers can only be initiated by the <b>sending</b> <b>bank</b> once they receive the proper wiring instructions from the receiving bank. These instructions include: the receiving bank's routing number, account number, name and dollar amount being transferred. This information is submitted to the Fed via the Fedwire system. Once the instructions are received and processed, the Fed will debit the funds from the sending bank's reserve account and credit the receiving bank's account. Wire transfers sent via Fedwire are completed in the same day, while some are completed instantly.|$|E
5000|$|SWIFT or IBAN wire {{transfers}} are {{not completely}} free of vulnerabilities. Every intermediary bank that handles a wire transaction can take a fee directly out of the wire payload (the assets being transferred) without the account holder's knowledge or consent. In many places, there is no legislation or technical means to protect customers from this practice. If bank S is the <b>sending</b> <b>bank</b> (or brokerage), and bank R is the receiving bank (or brokerage), and banks I1, I2 and I3 are intermediary banks, the client may only have a contract with bank S and/or R, but banks I1, I2 and I3 can (and often do) take money from the wire without any direct arrangement with the client. Clients are sometimes taken by surprise when less money arrives at bank R. Contrast this with cheques, where the amount transferred is guaranteed in full, and fees (if there are any) can be charged only at endpoint banks.|$|E
50|$|About 70 billion cheques {{were written}} {{annually}} in the US by 2001, though around 17 million adult Americans do not have bank accounts at all. When sending a payment by online banking in the US at some banks, the <b>sending</b> <b>bank</b> mails a cheque to the payee's bank or to the payee rather than sending the funds electronically. Certain companies whom a person pays with a cheque will turn it into an Automated Clearing House (ACH) or electronic transaction. Banks try to save time processing cheques by sending them electronically between banks. Cheque clearing is usually done through an electronic cheque broker, such as The Clearing House, Viewpointe LLC or the Federal Reserve Banks. Copies of the cheques are stored at a bank or the broker, for periods up to 99 years, {{and this is why}} some cheque archives have grown to 20 petabytes. The access to these archives is now worldwide, as most bank programming is now done offshore. Many utilities and most credit cards will also allow customers to pay by providing bank information and having the payee draw payment from the customer's account (direct debit). Many people in the US still use paper money orders to pay bills or transfer money which is a unique type of cheque.

40|$|A {{majority}} of the payments that are carried out today are executed through the electronic payment systems. Payments that are executed through these systems are administrated by payment service providers, these providers are, in general, banks. In spite of the socio-economic importance of payments and payment intermediation, there is an uncertainty regarding {{the legal status of}} payments and payment intermediation. Some describe payment intermediation as transport of means of payments, while some describe it in terms of claims and intermediation of information. There is, in other words, a need for clarification. Since the international trade is increasing, more and more payments are made to receivers abroad. The trade with Germany is very important for Sweden. Therefore, it can be an advantage for Swedish tradesmen, who are involved in businesses with German tradesmen, to know of the differences between Swedish and German law, when it comes to payments and payment intermediation. Also, in international trade, situations can occur that generally do not occur in domestic trade. EC-law must as well be taken into consideration, when discussing international payment intermediation between Sweden and Germany. I have in the thesis described the German legal system, in general features, and I have also made a brief outline of the Swedish international private law regulations that can be applied to a payment intermediation between Sweden and Germany. I have furthermore given {{a brief description of the}} relevant EC- regulations and -directives, in order to see to what extent a harmonization has been made, regarding payments and payment intermediation. One of my conclusions, after having studied Swedish, German and international law, is that when the sender of a payment wants to execute a payment through the payment systems, he gives the <b>sending</b> <b>bank</b> a commission to transfer a certain amount to the receiver. In return, the sender denounces claims towards the bank, equivalent to that amount. The <b>sending</b> <b>bank</b> then gives the receiving bank a commission to credit the receiver’s account. In return, the receiving bank obtains compensation from the <b>sending</b> <b>bank.</b> The commission is final when the correct account has been credited with the correct amount at the correct time by the correct sender. I have further come to the conclusion that the receiver’s claim towards the receiving bank arises already when the receiving bank acquires the commission from the <b>sending</b> <b>bank,</b> and not when the receiver’s account is being credited. I have thoroughly studied payments and payment intermediation according to both Swedish and German law, in order to see whether there are any differences between the legal systems. I have concluded, that there is a major difference in determining at what point of time a payment has been made, and therefore also whether the sender is in delay with the payment or not. According to Swedish law, the point of time when the receiver’s account is being credited is decisive. According to German law, at first hand, the point of time when the sender gives the commission to the <b>sending</b> <b>bank</b> is decisive. Another important difference is which legal relations the participators have with each other. In Swedish law, this matter has not been closely discussed, while in German law, in harmony with EC-law, the matter has been thoroughly analysed. The legal relations, concerning a payment intermediation, are to be regarded separately. This implies that the sender does not have legal relations with any other participant in the payment intermediation, for instance the receiving bank. I find that this model also is applicable to Swedish conditions...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a three-period model to analyze why banks need bank reserves for interbank payments despite {{the availability of}} other liquid assets like Treasury securities. The model shows that banks need extra liquidity if they settle bank transfers without the central bank. In this case, each pair of banks sending and receiving bank transfers must determine the terms of settlement between them bilaterally in an over- the-counter transaction. As a result, a receiving bank can charge a <b>sending</b> <b>bank</b> a premium for the settlement of bank transfers, because depositors'demand for timely payments causes a hold-up problem for a <b>sending</b> <b>bank.</b> In light of this result, the large value payment system operated by the central bank {{can be regarded as}} an interbank settlement contract to save liquidity. A third party like the central bank must operate this system because a custodian of collateral is necessary to implement the contract. This result implies that bank reserves are not independent liquid assets, but the balances of collateral submitted by banks to participate into a liquidity-saving contract. The optimal contract is the floor system. Whether a private clearing house can replace the central bank depends on the range of collateral it can accept. 2012 ～ 2016 年度科学研究費補助金[基盤研究(S) ]「長期デフレの解明」(研究代表者 東京大学経済学研究科・渡辺努, 課題番号： 24223003...|$|E

40|$|Payment {{systems are}} {{undergoing}} rapid and fundamental changes stimulated largely by technological progress especially distributed network technology and real-time processing. Internet and e-commerce {{will have a}} major impact on payment systems in the future. User demands and competition will speed up developments. Payment systems will move from conventions that were originally paper-based to truly network-based solutions. This paper presents a solution – E-Settlement – for improving interbank settlement systems. It is based on a decentralised approach to be fully integrated with the banks’ payment systems. The basic idea is that central bank money, the settlement cover, is transferred as an encrypted digital stamp as part of the interbank payment message. The future payment systems would in this model operate close to the Internet/e-mail concept by sending payment messages directly from the <b>sending</b> <b>bank’s</b> account/payment server to the system of the receiving bank with immediate final interbank settlement without intervening centralised processing. Payment systems would become more efficient and faster and the overall structure would be come straightforward. The E-Settlement and network-based system concept could be applied with major benefits for correspondent banking, ACH and RTGS processing environments. In order to assess this novel idea the Bank of Finland built a prototype of the E-Settlement model. It consist of a group of emulated <b>banks</b> <b>sending</b> payments to each other via a TCP/IP network under the control of a central bank as the liquidity provider and an administration site monitoring the system security. This paper contains an introduction to network-based payment systems and E-Settlement, the specifications of the E-Settlement model and the description, results and experiences of the actual E-Settlement prototype. network-based payment systems; settlement systems; interbank settlement; payment system integration...|$|R
