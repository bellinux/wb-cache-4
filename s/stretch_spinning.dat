Substantial improvement in the alignment of the phage parallel to the fibre axis is demon-strated by X-ray diffraction. This effect {{is due to the}} intrinsic diamagnetic aniso· tropy of the viruses and to their co·operative behaviour. The molecular structure and anisotropic physical properlies of polymers and elongated biological complexes can be studied most effectively in a highly oriented state.

40|$|In {{addition}} to <b>spinning</b> temperature, spinline <b>stretching</b> and <b>spinning</b> speed, {{the properties of}} gel-spun polyethylene fibres hot-drawn to the maximum draw ratio also depend on the polymer concentration, molecular weight and molecular weight distribution. Reducing the polymer concentration reduces the number of entanglements, and fibres with better properties are obtained. However, a minimum number of entanglements is necessary to ensure sufficient coherence of the entanglement network and avoid premature breakage of the spinline. Therefore, an optimal concentration exists which is shown to shift to a lower value for polyethylene with a smaller molecular weight distribution. Fibres with a tensile strength exceeding 6 GPa and a modulus of about 160 GPa can be prepared as long as spinline stretching is avoided. A smaller molecular weight distribution enhances the deteriorating effect of spinline stretching. The difference in morphologies for as-spun fibres prepared from different gel compositions and under different spinning conditions also strongly affects the cold-drawing behaviour of the extracted as-spun fibres. ...|$|R

This work represents a major shift from earlier studies in quantum dots, which have explored classical "narrowing" of the nuclear polarization distribution through feedback involving stochastic spin flips.

40|$|Large rocket {{cryogenic}} tank domes have typically been fabricated using Al-Cu based alloys like Al-Cu alloy 2219. The use of aluminum-lithium based alloys for rocket fuel tank domes can reduce weight because aluminum-lithium alloys have lower density and higher strength than Al-Cu alloy 2219. However, Al-Li alloys have rarely {{been used to}} fabricate rocket fuel tank domes because of the inherent low formability characteristic that make them susceptible to cracking during the forming operations. The ability to form metal by <b>stretch</b> forming or <b>spin</b> forming without excessive thinning or necking depends on the strain hardening exponent "n". The stain hardening exponent {{is a measure of}} how rapidly a metal becomes stronger and harder. A high strain hardening exponent is beneficial to a material's ability to uniformly distribute the imposed strain. Marshall Space Flight Center has developed a novel annealing process that can achieve a work hardening exponent on the order of 0. 27 to 0. 29, which is approximately 50 % higher than what is typically obtained for Al-Li alloys using the conventional method. The strain hardening exponent of the Al-Li alloy plates or blanks heat treated using the conventional method is typically on the order of 0. 17 to 0. 19. The effects of this novel annealing process on the formability of friction stir welded Al-Li alloy blanks are being studied at Marshall Space Flight Center.

40|$|An {{analysis}} is presented of <b>stretching,</b> shearing and <b>spin</b> of material line {{elements in a}} continuous medium. It is shown how to determine all pairs of material line elements at a point x, at time t, which instantaneously {{are not subject to}} shearing. For a given pair not subject to shearing, a formula is presented for the determination of a third material line element such that all three form a triad not subject to shearing, instantaneously. It is seen that there is an infinity of such triads not subject to shearing. A new decomposition of the velocity gradient L is introduced. In place of the classical decomposition of Cauchy and Stokes, L = d + w, where d is the stretching tensor and w is the spin tensor, the new decomposition is L = P +M, where P, called the "modified" stretching tensor, is not symmetric, and M, called the "modified" spin tensor, is skew-symmetric - the tensor P being chosen so that it has three linearly independent real right (and left) eigenvectors. The physical interpretation of this decomposition is that the material line elements along the three linearly independent right eigenvectors of P instantaneously form a triad not subject to shearing. They spin as a rigid body with angular velocity n (say) associated with M. Also, for each decomposition L = P + M, there is a decomposition L = 3 T +M̃, where M is also skewsymmetric. The triad of material line elements along the right eigenvectors of PT (the set reciprocal to the right eigenvectors of P) is also instantaneously not subject to shearing and rotates with angular velocity μ̃ (say) associated with M̃. It is seen that the vorticity vector w is the mean of the two angular velocities μ and μ̃, ω = (μ + μ̃) / 2. For irrotational motion, w = 0, so that n = -μ̃, any triad of material line elements suffering no shearing rotates with angular velocity equal and opposite to that of the reciprocal triad of material line elements. It is proved that provided d is not spherical, there is an infinity of choices for P and M in the decomposition L = P+M. Two special types of decompositions are introduced. The first type is called "CCS-decomposition" (where CCS is an abbreviation for Central Circular Section). It is associated with the infinite family of triads (not subject to shearing) with a common edge along the normal to one plane of central circular section of an ellipsoid D associated with the stretching tensor, and the two other edges arbitrary in the other plane of central circular section of D. There are two such CCS-decompositions. The second type is called "triangular decomposition", because, in a rectangular cartesian coordinate system, P has three off-diagonal zero elements. There are six such decompositions. © Springer-Verlag 2002. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Response to {{mechanical}} stress {{is important for}} tissue homeostasis, tissue architecture and muscle regeneration. All cells of an organism are subject {{to at least one}} of three types of {{mechanical stress}}: compression, shear stress or tension. The exact mechanisms how a cell senses mechanical stress and how it converts mechanical into chemical signals are still unknown and the elucidation of this process is the aim of my thesis. Defective mechanotransduction can be observed in a diverse group of diseases called laminopathies, such as Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy or dilated cardiomyopathy. LaminA and emerin, the proteins affected in these diseases, are part of a physical link that spans from the nuclear lamina to the extracellular matrix and might play a role in a cell’s sensation of and response to mechanical stress. Cells lacking either protein display reduced nuclear structural integrity, changes in transcriptional regulation, and defective nuclear mechanics and mechanotransduction. In the present study the first microarray-analysis of stretched primary mouse embryo fibroblasts revealed that cells react to biaxial strain by upregulation of a very distinct group of around 30 genes within 1 hour of stretching. No transcripts were downregulated, whereas after 6 hours of strain a large group of genes was affected by mechanical stress and showed up as well as downregulation. Among them was tenascin-C as well as some other proteins involved with extracellular matrix function. This was confirmed by QPCR and Affymetrix chip analysis in 2 immortalized mouse embryo fibroblast cell lines. We observed that biaxial strain leads to the activation of Erk, Rho/ROCK, and NfB pathways. However, though all three pathways were activated upon stretching, inhibition of Erk or ROCK did not decrease the early response to biaxial strain since transcripts induced after 1 hour of stretching were still upregulated in the presence of these inhibitors. Only inhibition of the NfB pathway blocked the stretch response of selected genes after one hour of cyclic stretching. Our results suggest that activation of NfB seem to depend on Ca 2 +-influx that is mediated by stretch-gated ion-channels in the cell membrane. One of the genes responding to stretching is Egr 3. It is an immediate early growth response gene which is induced by mitogenic stimulation and {{may play a role in}} muscle development. Its ability to activate tenascin-C, which possesses an Egr binding site in its promoter region, was examined by promotor-SEAP-reporter assays and by western blot. The role of the LINC complex in mechanotransduction was analyzed by expressing dominant-negative forms of sun 1 and nesprin in fibroblasts as well as in myogenic progenitors. Live imaging of mouse embryo fibroblasts revealed that nuclei are rotating in response to stretching. Although some nuclei were slowly rotating with time when monitored at rest, <b>stretching</b> induced nuclear <b>spinning.</b> Upon disruption of this direct link by overexpression of truncated dominant-negative forms of sun 1 or nesprin- 1, nuclei remained in their position even in stretched cells. Contrary to our expectations disruption of the LINC complex did not inhibit the stress response as determined by transcript profiling of stretched cells. To address the question whether a functional LINC complex plays a role in muscle development, we examined the differentiation of C 2 C 12 myogenic progenitor cells in the presence and absence of dominant-negative sun and nesprin.
