Farm to Market Road 407 runs east–west across the {{northern}} part of the city. Lewisville also encompasses most of Farm to Market Road 3040, which runs east–west towards Carrollton and Flower Mound.|$|E
5|$|ETNC's {{relative}} success {{during this}} period led to rivalry with other nearby colleges such as T. Henry Bridges' Henry College in Campbell, a 1904 attempt by Denison to entice Mayo to relocate the college there for {{a considerable amount of}} financial aid, and praise from perhaps its most famous alumnus, future Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives <b>Sam</b> <b>Rayburn.</b> By the time the 35th Texas Legislature voted to buy the college in 1917, it had educated more than 30,000 students, including more public school teachers than any other college or university in Texas during the same period.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to rain and flooding, winds damaged more homes and businesses, and a tornado was spawned {{a few miles}} southwest of Port Arthur. More than 19,000power outages were reported in the area near where Bonnie made landfall. Texas State Highway 87 was closed in Jefferson County due to debris and electrical poles fallen on the roadway. The storm left broken windows, scattered tree limbs, and debris filled streets in Port Arthur and Beaumont. At the latter, strong winds toppled a radio tower at the Texas Department of Public Safety building, while several schools suffered damage to the roof and windows. Marinas and boats at Lake <b>Sam</b> <b>Rayburn</b> were damaged. Hank Creek Marina, located across the lake, broke free from its moorings and floated away, while portions of were submerged. Four indirect fatalities were confirmed in Texas, two from traffic accidents, one from a house fire ignited by a candle, and another from drowning. Several injuries were also reported, including four after a truck flipped over due to strong winds.|$|E

25|$|First {{elected in}} the Truman {{landslide}} of 1948, he served three successive {{terms in the}} United States House of Representatives. With the South, including Texas, still mostly home to Yellow dog Democrats, winning the Democratic nomination was tantamount to election, and Bentsen was unopposed by Republicans {{in each of his}} three House campaigns. He became a protégé of Speaker of the House <b>Sam</b> <b>Rayburn</b> and developed a reputation as an excellent poker player.|$|E
25|$|Seymour Hersh {{stated that}} Robert F.

25|$|<b>Sam</b> <b>Rayburn</b> was an American lawmaker {{who served}} as the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives for 17 years, the longest tenure in U.S. history. He was also the only Democrat to serve more than one non-consecutive term, and one of the only two {{individuals}} to serve three different terms as Speaker, the other one being Henry Clay. First elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from Texas’s 4th district in 1912, he went on to serve continuously for almost five decades until his death in 1961, a record {{at the time of his}} death.|$|E
25|$|Truman was Vice President under President Franklin D. Roosevelt and was {{thrust into}} the {{presidency}} following Roosevelt's death. Truman did not garner the same support as the deceased president. Democrats had controlled Congress since 1931, for 16 years, and Roosevelt had been elected to a record four terms in office. The 1946 election resulted in Republicans picking up 55 seats to win majority control. Joseph William Martin, Jr., Republican of Massachusetts, became Speaker of the House, exchanging places with <b>Sam</b> <b>Rayburn,</b> Democrat of Texas, who became the new Minority Leader. The Democratic defeat was the largest since they were trounced in the 1928 pro-Republican wave that brought Herbert Hoover to power.|$|E
25|$|The DFW Airport area {{is served}} by International Parkway (partially State Highway 97 Spur), which runs {{through the center of}} the airport, {{connecting}} to the Airport Freeway (State Highway 183) on the southern side of the airport and the John W. Carpenter Freeway (State Highway 114) on the northern side. The International Parkway continues north of State Highway 114, carrying the State Highway 121 designation for a short while until its interchange with the Lyndon B. Johnson Freeway (I-635), where State Highway 121 continues north as the <b>Sam</b> <b>Rayburn</b> Tollway. I-35E is easily accessed by going north on International Parkway, or east on I-635 or 114.|$|E
25|$|During the {{fourteen}} years following his first election, Clay was re-elected five {{times to the}} House and to the speakership. Clay's re-election as Speaker was aided by {{the weakness of the}} Federalist Party, which failed to win control of either chamber of Congress after 1801. Clay's tenure in the House was interrupted from 1814 to 1815, when he traveled to Europe to negotiate a peace treaty with the British, and from 1821 to 1823, when Clay briefly retired to rebuild his family's fortune {{in the aftermath of the}} Panic of 1819. With a tenure of ten years and 196 days, Clay served more than twice as long as any other pre-Civil War Speaker. Only <b>Sam</b> <b>Rayburn</b> has occupied the office for a longer amount of time.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, {{with the}} help of Bartlett's influence, the Speaker of the House, <b>Sam</b> <b>Rayburn,</b> who until 1957 had been an ardent {{opponent}} of the Alaskan statehood cause, changed his mind and when Congress reconvened in January 1958, President Eisenhower fully endorsed the bill for the first time. Senator Lyndon B. Johnson promised his commitment to the bill but others still stood in the way, such as Representative Howard W. Smith of Virginia, Chairman of the powerful Rules Committee, and Thomas Pelly of Washington State who wanted the Alaskan waters to be open to use by Washingtonians. Eventually, though, such resistance was able to be bypassed and the House passed the statehood bill. The Senate, which had had its own version of the bill as well as the House's version, finally managed to pass the House's bill through the fervent urging of Bartlett by a 64–20 vote. On January 3, 1959, after much struggle and through the efforts of many, Alaska finally became the 49th state of the United States of America after President Eisenhower's signing of the official declaration.|$|E
25|$|In 1937, Johnson {{successfully}} campaigned in {{a special}} election for Texas's 10th congressional district, that covered Austin and the surrounding hill country. He ran on a New Deal platform and was effectively aided by his wife. He served in the House from April 10, 1937, to January 3, 1949. President Franklin D. Roosevelt found Johnson to be a welcome ally and conduit for information, {{particularly with regard to}} issues concerning internal politics in Texas (Operation Texas) and the machinations of Vice President John Nance Garner and Speaker of the House <b>Sam</b> <b>Rayburn.</b> Johnson was immediately appointed to the Naval Affairs Committee. He worked for rural electrification and other improvements for his district. Johnson steered the projects towards contractors that he personally knew, such as the Brown Brothers, Herman and George, who would finance much of Johnson's future career. In 1941, he ran for the Democratic U.S. Senate nomination {{in a special}} election; his main opponent was the sitting Governor of Texas, businessman and radio personality W. Lee O'Daniel; Johnson narrowly lost the Democratic primary, which was then tantamount to election, with O'Daniel receiving 175,590 votes (30.49%), and Johnson 174,279 (30.26%).|$|E
500|$|Recreational Road 255 {{continues}} slightly northeasterly, {{passing through}} mainly farmland before reaching its junction with SH 63. RE 255 continues northward, entering {{the community of}} Ebenezer and intersecting a few local roads in the community. The roadway proceeds east and passes the McGee Cemetery. RE 255 proceeds to the Angelina River at the <b>Sam</b> <b>Rayburn</b> Dam. The road bends northeastward, passing through the small Overlook Park and continuing northeast along the dam. It turns southeast and continues along the dam. The dam ends after approximately [...] and the highway exits Angelina National Forest and enters Twin Dikes Park.

The highway proceeds southeasterly, passing several small homes and businesses that make up a portion of the community of <b>Sam</b> <b>Rayburn.</b> RE 255 proceeds northeast for a short distance before shifting eastward through Rayburn Country and intersecting FM 1007. Turning southeast, the route passes the southern edge of the Rayburn Country golf resort before exiting the community of <b>Sam</b> <b>Rayburn</b> and reentering rural areas. RE 255 shifts southeast and proceeds to an intersection with U.S. Route 96, a divided highway. The route bends northeasterly, intersecting CR 232 before proceeding out of Jasper County.|$|E
500|$|Recreational Road255 (RE255) is a Recreational Road {{located in}} Tyler, Jasper, and Newton counties, {{in the southeastern}} region of the U.S. state of Texas. The highway is {{approximately}} [...] long, and travels through mainly rural areas in the northern portion of the three counties. RE 255 begins at an intersection with U.S. Route 69 (US 69), in Tyler County, {{near the city of}} Colmesneil. The route travels through rural farmland in northern Tyler County, and crosses the Neches River into Jasper County. The roadway intersects State Highway 63 (TX 63) and US 96, and helps form part of the <b>Sam</b> <b>Rayburn</b> Dam. The route continues into Newton County, intersecting TX 87, before terminating at an intersection with Farm to Market Road 692 (FM 692), near the Louisiana border. RE 255 helps provide access to Angelina National Forest, the <b>Sam</b> <b>Rayburn</b> Reservoir, and the Toledo Bend Reservoir, which give the highway its Recreational Road designation.|$|E
500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous ETNC alumnus was future Democratic {{politician}} and Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives <b>Sam</b> <b>Rayburn,</b> who graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1903. Rayburn spoke positively of the school, especially Mayo's credit system that allowed students to [...] "attend free with a promise to pay when they got out and made some money", which [...] "made it possible for {{hundreds and hundreds of}} young people to go to college who could not have afforded to attend another institution".|$|E
500|$|The first {{portion of}} what would become RE 255 was {{designated}} on June 12, 1945 as the first stretch of Farm to Market Road 255 (FM 255). This route traveled from an intersection with SH 63 to Ferguson at a length of approximately [...] On September 27, 1960, FM 255 was extended [...] northeastward to the McGee Bend Dam on Lake <b>Sam</b> <b>Rayburn.</b> FM 255 was extended on June 15, 1961 along a road that traveled along the McGee Bend Dam to an intersection with US 96.

FM 2628 from US 69 east 4.4 miles and FM 3125 from SH 87 to FM 692 were combined with the route on February 15, 1970, adding [...] and [...] respectively to FM 255.|$|E
500|$|While on leave, he {{discussed}} {{with family and}} friends the possibility of his enrolling in West Point and making the Army a lifetime career. Inquiries on his behalf had been sent through military channels before he left Europe, and Patch had encouraged him to enroll. Both Edson and Paulick had also counseled Murphy about attending the military academy, with Paulick offering to tutor him for the entrance examinations. Speaker of the U. S. House of Representatives <b>Sam</b> <b>Rayburn</b> supported the idea and offered to use his influence to help Murphy enroll at West Point. [...] Murphy expressed concerns to Edison and others that his war injuries might prevent him from passing the physical examination required to enroll. [...] Texas A University was another military school Murphy considered as a possibility. In the end, he enrolled in neither school. A belated Good Conduct Medal was presented to Murphy on 21 August. He was discharged with the rank of first lieutenant at a 50 percent disability classification on 21 September and transferred to the Officers' Reserve Corps.|$|E
500|$|Supporting Roosevelt's {{provision}} {{of aid to}} Allied Powers during World War II, Barkley sponsored the Lend-Lease Act in the Senate. In November 1943, he helped draft the Connally–Fulbright Resolution {{for the creation of}} an international peace-keeping body {{at the end of the}} war, an idea he had favored since Woodrow Wilson's support of the League of Nations. Supreme Court Justice and fellow Kentuckian Louis Brandeis influenced Barkley to adopt Zionism; during and after the war, Barkley advocated creation of a Jewish homeland in Palestine and introduced a 1943 resolution demanding that the Nazis to be punished for persecuting Jews. U.S. entry into the war diverted Roosevelt's attention away from domestic affairs. Vice President Wallace, House Speaker <b>Sam</b> <b>Rayburn,</b> Democratic House Floor Leader John William McCormack, and Barkley – the president's [...] "Big Four" [...] – helped develop and pass the administration's legislative agenda. Barkley regularly met with the chairmen of the Senate's standing committees, forming a sort of legislative cabinet. With their support, he secured passage of the War Powers Act and the Emergency Price Control Act. He also advocated passage of a measure to outlaw poll taxes, but the bill was defeated.|$|E
500|$|At Scholes Field, {{sustained}} {{winds of}} [...] and gusts up to [...] were observed, ripping doors off the hangars. A walkway and four boats were damaged at the Hanks Creek Marina, {{located on the}} eastern shore of <b>Sam</b> <b>Rayburn</b> Reservoir, while the marina itself was deroofed. Similar impact was reported at the nearby Shirley Creek Marina. Strong winds destroyed four high steel towers, which supported power lines that traversed the northern Galveston Bay near the Houston Ship Channel. Elsewhere in eastern Texas, wind damage was relatively minor, mainly limited to shattered windows, toppled trees and power lines, and generally light impact to houses, mobile homes, buildings, farm buildings, and businesses in several counties in eastern Texas. Falling trees blocked numerous roads and struck houses and power lines, leaving approximately 52,000homes and businesses without electricity, most of them in the Galveston area. There were three tornadoes in the county, the first of which unroofed some buildings in Galveston. The second tornado, also touching down in Galveston, inflicted roof damage to many businesses, homes, and apartment complexes. The third tornado, spawned in League City, toppled several trees and a flag pole. In Chambers County a tornado near Kemah inflicted damage to a beach house. Another tornado in the county spawned in downtown Baytown shattered windows at a hospital, a mall, and store windows. In Polk County, a small tornado caused minor damage, totaling $10,000.|$|E
