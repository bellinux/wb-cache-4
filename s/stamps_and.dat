40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{so-called}} roof collapse in soft lithography. Roof collapse {{is due to the}} adhesion between the PDMS <b>stamp</b> <b>and</b> substrate, and it may affect the quality of soft lithography. Our analysis accounts for the interactions of multiple punches and the effect of elastic mismatch between the PDMS <b>stamp</b> <b>and</b> substrate. A scaling law among the stamp modulus, punch height and spacing, and work of adhesion between the <b>stamp</b> <b>and</b> substrate is established. Such a scaling law leads to a simple criterion against the unwanted roof collapse. The present study agrees well with the experimental data. close 9410...|$|R
