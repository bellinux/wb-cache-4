40|$|Engine inlets for subsonic V/STOL {{aircraft}} must operate over a {{wide range}} of conditions without the severe internal flow separation that can cause sudden changes in engine thrust, excessively high fan blade stresses, and possibly core-compressor stall. An experimental investigation was conducted {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} tangential blowing to maintain attached flow at high inlet angles of attack. The inlet had a relatively thin lip (lip contraction ratio of 1. 46). Two blowing slot locations were investigated: one on the lip and the other in the diffuser. The effect of two <b>slot</b> <b>heights</b> (0. 0508 and 0. 152 cm) and three slot circumferential extents, the largest being 120 deg, also was investigated.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} two-dimensional tangential-slot injection into a {{turbulent boundary layer}} at a freestream Mach number of 2. 4 has been conducted. Nearly adiabatic surface temperatures were maintained during all tests. Static and pitot pressure profiles at four stations downstream of the slot were obtained. Skin friction was measured at the last three stations with a self-nulling balance. Schlieren photographs of the flow field were also obtained. Most of the data were obtained with slot Mach numbers of 0. 31 and 0. 66 corresponding to slot pressure less than and equal to stream static pressure, respectively. For the latter matched-pressure case, tangential slot injection reduced the surface shear at the three measuring stations by about 60 to 20 percent for increasing downstream distances from the slot of 12 to 28 <b>slot</b> <b>heights.</b> However, for the other case where slot pressure was less than stream static pressure, the effect of injection was to increase the shear by about 90 percent at the last downstream station of 28 <b>slot</b> <b>heights.</b> This increase in shear is attributed to the rapid acceleration of the low speed injectant stream by the high speed main stream and the increasing pressure through the recompression zone which is absent for the matched pressure case...|$|R

40|$|The sound {{generated}} by a 2 -D, 20 % thick elliptical circulation control airfoil with single slot blowing is experimentally investigated in the University of Florida Aeroacoustic Flow Facility. Experiments are conducted {{at a variety of}} freestream and slot jet velocities for three different <b>slot</b> <b>heights</b> h. The airfoil’s lift characteristics compare favorably with data from a previous research study in a conventional closed-wall wind tunnel. A large aperture microphone array reveals low noise contamination in the UFAFF test section. Data from farfield microphones indicate both tonal and broadband noise sources. Vortex shedding from the rounded trailing edge occurs when jet momentum levels are insufficient to prevent flow separation. High frequency tonal noise is also identified due to vortex shedding, where fD/Ujet = 0. 21, from the D = 0. 28 mm thick slot lip. For large jet velocities, high frequency broadband slot jet noise is identified as the dominant noise source for fh/Ujet> 0. 1. Jet velocity amplitude and frequency non-dimensionalization collapse the high-frequency portion of the spectra reasonably well when freestream velocity is low or zero. For curvature and slot noise {{generated by}} the external boundary layer flow, local mean velocities at the trailing edge and above the slot are not more effective than freestream and jet velocities when non-dimensionalizing frequency.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} an experiment for acquiring supersonic film cooling performance data in canonical configurations suitable for code validation. A methodology for selecting appropriate experimental conditions is developed and used to select test conditions in the UMD atmospheric pressure wind tunnel that are relevant to film cooling conditions encountered in the J- 2 X rocket engine. A new technique for inferring wall heat flux with 10 % uncertainty from temperature-time histories of embedded sensors is developed and implemented. Preliminary heat flux measurements on the uncooled upper wall and on the lower wall with the film cooling flow turned off suggest that RANS solvers using Menter's SST model are able to predict heat flux within 15 % in the far-field (> 10 injection <b>slot</b> <b>heights)</b> but are very inaccurate in the near-field.

The effects of spanwise <b>slot</b> <b>height</b> variation and of leading edge blowing on performance were also investigated. The performance results showed that of the three slot heights tested, a slot height/chord ratio of 0. 0022 produced the most lift coefficient for a given blowing rate.

However, {{there has been little}} research into the possible airframe noise reduction benefits of a circulation control wing. The key element of noise is the jet noise associated with the jet sheet emitted from the blowing slot.

40|$|A coating die is {{used for}} distributing liquid in order to apply a uniform film on a solid surface. The fluid flowing through the die cavity can exert a {{pressure}} of up to 500, 000 Pascal on the die body. This liquid pressure can distort the die and lead to a non-uniform slot opening, which in turn causes non-uniformity in the coating thickness. Distortion of the die can also occur during non-isothermal operation of the die; this is an undesired consequence of delivering liquids at a different temperature than the die itself. The distortions undergone by the die both due to liquid pressure and non-isothermal conditions should be within the manufacturing tolerances for the <b>slot</b> <b>heights</b> {{in order to maintain}} uniformity in the coating. The deformation exhibited by a coating die due to pressure loadings is modeled both two-dimensionally and three-dimensionally. A two-dimensional model has lower computational load and is preferred for die design. For the two-dimensional analysis of a coating die, the finite element method is used to determine the deflections due to pressure loadings with a focus on <b>slot</b> <b>heights.</b> A model of low computational load is also developed based on beam theory, and its results are compared with those of the two-dimensional finite element analyses predictions. The beam model is incorporated in a die design and simulation program in which flow and slot deformations are coupled. Two-dimensional finite element analyses due to non-isothermal conditions are also performed on the coating die to give an estimate of the die deflection due to temperature variations within the die. A three-dimensional coating die with varying inner cavity area is modeled and analyzed to check its predictions with those of the two-dimensional finite element analyses and beam theory results. In the literature reviewed, flow distribution is fully coupled to die deformation only for extrusion dies. Extrusion dies are used for extruding melted polymers of very high viscosity. Therefore, the deflections are much larger for extrusion dies than for coating dies. Mechanical adjustments can be used to manage the large deflections in the case of extrusion dies whereas coating dies have to be designed for small deflections comparable to manufacturing tolerances. This is the first time where a coupled analysis has been done for a coating die. This research provides the slot deflections for a coating die subjected to pressure loadings that vary throughout the die length. The model of flow distribution coupled with die distortion incurs low computational load and is intended for use in design and simulation programs. Die design guidelines are developed based on examination of the die dimensions and flow parameters having the greatest effect on slot deflections...|$|R
