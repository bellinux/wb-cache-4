40|$|One of {{the best}} ways to get {{information}} about plasma and interactions within it, is the study on visible light emitted from plasma. Detection of the emission spectrum from plasma leads to identify the spectral lines of ions and impurities inside the plasma and measurement of all related parameters to ion flux such as velocity and temperature. The first measurement of impurities into the IR-T 1 tokamak plasma is done by spectroscopic technique.

We present a Bayesian approach for integrating data of multiple detected peaks that come from one compound. We demonstrate the approach through a simulated experiment and validate it on ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) experiments for metabolomics and lipidomics. Peaks that are likely to be associated with one compound can be clustered by the similarity of their chromatographic shape. Changes of concentration between sample groups can be inferred more accurately when multiple peaks are available.

40|$|Following a {{radiological}} incident {{the rapid}} identification {{of those individuals}} exposed to critically high radiation doses is important for initial triage and medical treatment. It has been previously demonstrated that scoring of radiation-induced foci of the phosphorylated histone γ-H 2 AX, which form at the sites of DNA double-strand breaks, {{may be used to}} determine radiation exposure levels from blood samples. Although faster than the ‘gold standard’ dicentric assay, foci scoring is still impractical in a field situation where large numbers of people may need to be screened. To deal with such a situation, an inexpensive portable device with high throughput capacity is desirable. Here we describe a portable microfluidic fluorescence <b>spectrometer</b> <b>device</b> which passes a suspension of γ-H 2 AX immunofluorescence-stained lymphocytes through a focused 488 nm laser beam in a microfluidic chamber and records emission spectra over the range 495 – 725 nm.

Proof of principle is demonstrated using cultured lymphoblastoid cells, exposed to X-ray doses between 0 and 8 Gy.

Air pollution problem concerns the emissions of gases such as CO, CO 2, NO, NO 2, SO 2 and also aerosols, soot and volatile organic compounds.

The experimental setup comprises a passive radiative emission measurement method combined with an active laser-measurement method. The passive method is based on the use of gas emission spectroscopy.

40|$|Based {{on current}} CERN infrastructure, an electron-proton {{collider}} is proposed at a centre-of-mass energy of about 9 TeV. A 7 TeV LHC bunch {{is used as}} the proton driver to create a plasma wakefield which then accelerates electrons to 3 TeV, these then colliding with the other 7 TeV LHC proton beam. The basic parameters of the collider are presented, which although of very high energy, has integrated luminosities {{of the order of}} 1 pb$^{- 1 }$/year. For such a collider, with a centre-of-mass energy 30 times greater than HERA, parton momentum fractions, $x$, down to about $ 10 ^{- 8 }$ are accessible for $Q^ 2 $ of 1 GeV$^ 2 $ and could lead to effects of saturation or some other breakdown of DGLAP being observed. The total photon-proton cross section can be measured up to very high energies and also at different energies as the possibility of varying the electron beam energy is assumed; this could have synergy with cosmic-ray physics. Other physics which can be pursued at such a collider are contact interaction searches, such as quark and electron substructure, and measurements of the proton structure as well as other more conventional measurements of QCD at high energies and in a new kinematic regime. The events at very low $x$ will lead to electrons and the hadronic final state produced at very low angles and so a novel <b>spectrometer</b> <b>device</b> will be needed to measure these.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{demonstrate}} ultra-low loss transmission across a pholonic crystal super-prism device consisting of 600 lattice periods etched into a slab waveguide at wavelengths both {{above and below}} the primary band-gap. By modifying the refractive index of the holes we have reduced overall insertion loss to 4. 5 dB across the entire visible region of the spectrum, greatly enhancing transmission and extinction in higher order stop-bands. In addition we show that the remaining loss is predominantly due to impedance mismatch at the boundary between patterned / unpatterned slab waveguide regions and so is no longer proportional to the length of the photonic crystal or the number of lattice periods. This is an important step forward for the realization of functional photonic crystal time delay elements, dispersion compensators and super-prism <b>spectrometer</b> <b>devices.</b> Experimental loss measurements compare extremely well with Finite difference time domain simulations which were used to investigate the effect of etch depth on scattering loss.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the design, development, construction {{and performance of}} an instrumentation system suitable for the measurement of single electron quantum dot devices. The inaugural measurement with this new system produced fascinating experimental data from a novel magnetic <b>spectrometer</b> <b>device.</b> This data, presented in chapter 5, {{suggests that it is}} possible to measure the single particle spacing in a 500 nm quantum dot device independent of the Coulomb blockade energy and within an electron mean free path. Devices were defined on a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure, the interface of which formed a 2 dimensional electron gas (2 DEG). The surface was patterned with metallic surface gates. On the application of a potential to the gates, the electrons were depleted from beneath the gate and the pattern was transferred to the 2 DEG. The devices were fabricated in a Hall bar geometry using standard nanofabrication techniques. Measurements were performed using a 3 He/ 4 He Kelvinox 25 dilution refrigerator unit at a lattice temperature of TL 45 mK. Prior to the work detailed in this thesis the lowest effective electron temperature available to quantum transport researchers at Glasgow had been 1. 2 Kelvin. This was achieved with the use of a pumped 4 He variable temperature insert (VTI), for which 1. 2 K represented the lowest working temperature. Although a 3 He/ 4 He dilution unit had been available for some time, the unit had exhibited an effective electron temperature of Te> 7 K. As a direct result of the work contained within this thesis (detailed in chapter 4), the lower limit of the effective electron temperature range available was extended down to 250 mK. This represents an improvement of more than an order of magnitude over the lowest effective electron temperature previously available and an improvement of > 20 over that previously available within the dilution limit. In order to achieve this improvement a systems approach was adopted. The individual subsystems associated with the design of the new measurement system were designed to work in conjunction with one another. Great care was taken with respect to referencing potentials, shielding, intrinsic noise of the electronic components used and vibration isolation in order that the measurement system imposed the minimum induced electron heating on the device under test. Measurements were performed on quantum dot devices in the Coulomb blockade regime. Periodic peaks in the conductance of a quantum dot were observed. These conductance peaks were seen in response to an applied gate voltage, and are referred to as Coulomb oscillations. Such oscillations are a result of classical charging effects due to the addition or subtraction of a single electron to, or from, the quantum dot. These effects are a direct result of the quantisation of charge. Energy quantisation due to the confinement of the electrons wave-function, also plays a role in quantum dot devices. In the devices studied the classical charging energy, that gives rise to the Coulomb oscillations is generally an order of magnitude greater than the quantum mechanical effects that give rise to the single particle spectrum...|$|E

To perform highly integrated tasks, the striatum relies on a complex network of communication within and between brain regions with a key role devoted to secreted molecules. To characterize the rat striatum secretome, we combined in vivo microdialysis together with proteomics analysis of trypsin digests and peptidomics studies of native fragments. This versatile approach, carried out using different microdialysis probes and mass <b>spectrometer</b> <b>devices,</b> allowed evidencing with high confidence the expression of 88 proteins and 100 processed peptides. Their secretory pathways were predicted by in silico analysis. Whereas high molecular weight proteins were mainly secreted by the classical mode (94 %), low molecular weight proteins equally used classical and non-classical modes (53 and 47 %, respectively). In addition, our results suggested alternative secretion mechanisms not predicted by bioinformatics tools. Based on spectrum counting, we performed a relative quantification of secreted proteins and peptides in both basal and neuronal depolarization conditions. This allowed detecting a series of neuropeptide precursors and a 6 -fold increase for neurosecretory protein VGF and proenkephalin (PENK) levels. A focused investigation and a long peptide experiment led to the identification of new secreted non-opioid PENK peptides, referred to as PENK 114 – 133, PENK 239 – 260, and PENK 143 – 185.
