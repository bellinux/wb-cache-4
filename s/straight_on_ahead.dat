5000|$|Single-engine {{aircraft}} will normally reject any takeoff {{after an}} engine failure, regardless of speed, {{as there is}} no power available to continue the takeoff. Even if the airplane is already airborne, if sufficient runway remains, an attempt to land <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> the runway may be made. This may also apply to some light twin engine airplanes.|$|R

5000|$|Although Grant {{never made}} public her {{intentions}} to crossover to mainstream music during this period, her success might have hinted at future decisions. When she penetrated {{into the country}} charts in late 1983 with the holiday single [...] "Tennessee Christmas", she managed to be nominated for an ACM award for Best New Female Vocalist. In 1985 she continued her success when she performed [...] "Angels", a song from her 1984 album <b>Straight</b> <b>Ahead,</b> <b>on</b> the nationally televised Grammy Awards.|$|R
60|$|The eastern rise of ground, a {{sage and}} juniper slope, was in plain sight. Hare saw a white flash; then Silvermane {{broke out of}} the cedars into the sage. One of the {{brothers}} raced him half {{the length of the}} slope, and then the other coming out headed him off down toward the forest. Soon the pounding of hoofs sounded through the trees nearer and nearer. Silvermane came out <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> the open level. He was running easily.|$|R
5000|$|A ship's {{look-out}} {{managed to}} cry out [...] "Breakers ahead!", {{but it was too}} late, and the ship ploughed <b>on</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> and was broken on the rocks of West King Island. Within minutes the ship took on a large volume of water. There were six lifeboats on board and they were immediately launched. The captain stayed with his ship until she was fully under, when he was washed into the sea and picked up by one of the lifeboats.|$|R

During the summer of 2015, Paris law was modified to allow cyclists to treat certain stop lights as yield signs as allowed by signage. The change only applied to right turns or going straight at a T-junction.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was past}} three {{when he left}} the house, but what did he care for that? He was so mad with joy that he did not even know whither he was going. He went <b>on</b> <b>straight</b> <b>ahead,</b> and came to no check, till he found himself waving his hat over his head in the New Road. He then began to {{conceive}} that his conduct must have been rather wild, for he was brought to a stand-still in a crossing by four or five cabmen, who were rival candidates for his custom.|$|R
500|$|The {{ships were}} fitted with three [...] Krupp rifled breech-loading (RBL) guns and six RBL [...] Krupp guns.

5000|$|The {{album was}} awarded 4 stars in an Allmusic review by Michael G. Nastos which stated [...] "Sonny Clark's {{conception}} of modern jazz {{is not far}} removed from his peer group of the late '50s, in that advanced melodic and harmonic ideas override the basic precepts of swing and simplicity. What sets Clark apart from other jazz pianists lies in his conception of democracy to allow his bandmates to steam <b>straight</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> compositions he has written with them in mind... Except the extraordinary Leapin' and Lopin', this album of contrasts, depth, and spirit showcases Clark's dual concepts brilliantly, and is only a half step below his best".|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{whether the}} original Roelofs effect and the induced Roelofs effect {{are caused by}} the same shift in perceived straight ahead. Subjects were presented with a target within a frame in complete darkness. Target and frame could both be shifted {{to the left or}} right of objective <b>straight</b> <b>ahead.</b> <b>On</b> separate trials, subjects gave verbal estimates about the position of either the target or the frame. The eccentricity of the frame was underestimated (the original Roelofs effect). However, the perceived position of the target did not follow this misjudgement of the eccentricity of the frame (the induced Roelofs effect was not present). Thus, it is unlikely that both effects have a common origin in misjudging egocentric straight ahead...|$|R

5000|$|The {{relationship}} with the Convention got rockier throughout the 1980s. Prior to these years, resolutions had passed the annual meetings regularly expressing near-unanimous support to the BJC and its stands.
