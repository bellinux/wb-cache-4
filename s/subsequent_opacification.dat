40|$|Disruption of the connexin a 3 (Cx 46) gene (a 3 (2 / 2)) in mice {{results in}} severe {{cataracts}} within the nuclear por-tion of the lens. These cataracts {{are associated with}} pro-teolytic processing of the abundant lens protein g-crystal-lin, leading to its aggregation and <b>subsequent</b> <b>opacification</b> of the lens. The general cysteine protease inhibitor, E- 64, blocked cataract formation and g-crystal-lin cleavage in a 3 (2 / 2) lenses. Using {{a new class of}} activ-ity-based cysteine protease affinity probes, we identified the calcium-dependent proteases, m-calpain and Lp 82, as the primary targets of E- 64 in the lens. Profiling changes in protease activities throughout cataractogenesis indi-cated that Lp 82 activity was dramatically increased in a 3 (2 / 2) lenses and correlated both spatially and temporally with cataract formation. Increased Lp 82 activity was du...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{concentrations}} of levamisole and of mebendazole {{were applied to}} 1 eye in groups of 4 patients with ocular onchocerciasis in northern Cameroon. No effect resulted from up to 3. 0 % mebendazole suspensions, but 3. 0 % levamisole solutions rapidly caused entry of microfilariae, straightening out and <b>subsequent</b> <b>opacification</b> of previously curled-up living microfilariae, the rapid formation of typical limbal globular infiltrates, and the subsequent formation of fluffy opacities around the microfilariae. These changes are typical of all other drugs so far studied that have a microfilaricidal action on O. volvulus [...] diethlycarbamizine citrate (DEC), suramin, and metrifonate. The efficacy of 3. 0 % levamisole approximated to that of 0. 03 % DEC. This {{is in keeping with}} published observations on the filaricidal activity of these 2 compounds. It is suggested that this system of drug testing should be considered for systematic use in the search for more effective and safer drugs for onchocerciasis...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Cataract {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{ophthalmologic}} entities. If left untreated, it inevitably leads to blindness. Current gold standard of treatment is the cataract extraction and subsequent implantation of an intraocular lens (IOL) into the posterior capsule. Posterior capsule fibrosis and <b>subsequent</b> <b>opacification</b> (PCO) represents the most prevalent long-term complication of this treatment option and the objective of this study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 38 patients following cataract extraction and phacoemulsification were included in this trial, receiving 4 eye examinations over a 44 day period. Results were documented as digital photographs. 20 patients had received a CeeOn Edge 911 A (Alcon) IOL, 18 an AcrySof MA 60 (Pharamacia). Each eye examination included determination of refraction, visus as well as a slit lamp exam of the following parameters: posterior and/or anterior capsule fibrosis, development of posterior capsule folding, localisation of capsulorhexis and lens centering. After each re-examination, rhexis length and area were determined using the photographs. RESULTS: Parameters influencing size of rhexis: Location of capsulorhexis: Group 1 (rhexis stable at 360 Â° on lens) vs. Group 2 (rhexis 4, 77 mm in diameter. Rhexes placed excentric of lens center also showed a tendency toward a higher prevalence of posterior capsule fibrosis. SUMMARY: The results of this study indicate that for prevention of PCO capsulrhexis diameter should be between 4, 77 and 5 mm. A larger rhexis significantly increases the risk for displacement of the rhexis excentric of lens center. This study cannot statistically prove that a displacement of the rhexis increases the risk for posterior capsule fibrosis, but indicates this correlation, thus supporting numerous studies by other authors. There was a statistically higher incidence of posterior capsule folding with AcrySof lenses. With CeeOn Edge lenses we saw a worse performance in terms of capsulorhexis displacement. This lens also appears to increase the risk for posterior capsule fibrosis. A definitive evaluation and recommendation of the better lens is inhibited by the short time frame chosen for this study. A reassessment should be made in 2 - 3 years...|$|E
