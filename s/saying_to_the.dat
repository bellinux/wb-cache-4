25|$|To {{the jurors}} who voted to acquit him, Socrates gives encouragement: his supernatural daimonion did not {{interfere}} with his conduct of the legal defence, which he viewed {{as a sign that}} such a defence was the correct action. In that way, the daimonion communicated to Socrates that death might be a good thing; either death is annihilation (release from earthly worry) and not to be feared, or death is migration (higher plane of existence) in which reside the souls of personages and heroes, such as Hesiod and Homer and Odysseus. Socrates concludes his self-defence by <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> court that he bears no ill-will, neither towards his accusers — Lycon, Anytus, and Meletus — nor the jurors. He asks that they ensure the well-being of his three sons, so that they learn to live ethically.|$|E
25|$|The {{election}} of 1870 {{was the first}} opportunity for African-Americans to vote in Delaware elections, and Ponder’s tenure was marred by an ongoing response to this change. Ponder himself {{was in no way}} sympathetic, <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> General Assembly that the Federal government was wrong in extending the franchise to “uneducated Negroes.” The 1870 election featured rigged voter lists that effectively denied the vote to most African-Americans, and resulted in all the seats in the General Assembly going to the Democratic Party. Two years later, in response, U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant sent in federal troops to police the elections, winning a few elections for Republicans, but undoubtedly prolonging the bitterness felt towards the federal government and their Republican followers in Delaware. The immediate result was the passage of a poll tax and the “Assessment Act of 1873,” that effectively allowed tax collectors the ability to remove people from voter list, allegedly for not paying their taxes, and made it enormously complicated for the voter to have their name restored.|$|E

25|$|As {{soon as the}} Captain of the Guard {{declared}} his charge to make him prisoner, Cromwell in a rage cast his bonnet on the ground, <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> duke of Norfolk and others of the Privy Council assembled there {{that this was the}} reward of his services, and that he appealed to their consciences as to whether he was a traitor; but since he was treated thus he renounced all pardon, as he had never thought to have offended, and only asked the King not to make him languish long. Thereupon some said he was a traitor, others that he should be judged according to the laws he had made, which were so sanguinary that often words spoken inadvertently with good intention had been constituted high treason. The duke of Norfolk having reproached him with some “villennyes” done by him, snatched off the order of St. George which he bore on his neck, and the Admiral, to show himself as great an enemy in adversity as he had been thought a friend in prosperity, untied the Garter. Then, by a door which opens upon the water, he was put in a boat and taken to the Tower without the people of this town suspecting it until they saw all the King's archers under Mr. Cheyney {{at the door of the}} prisoner's house, where they made an inventory of his goods.|$|E

500|$|Mikkel S. Eriksen, Tor Erik Hermansen, and Ester Dean {{assisted}} Perry {{in writing}} [...] "Peacock" [...] for her third studio album, Teenage Dream, released in 2010.

Midway through recording the album, Perry recalled <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> people she was working with: [...] "Look I've got a lot of jewels, but I really don't have the crown. I really don't have that full-blown presentation".

In 1992, John Marshall of Gay Times expressed the following opinion: [...] " [...] was a 'scene-queen,' not afraid to publicly express his gayness, but unwilling to analyse or justify his 'lifestyle'... It was as if Freddie Mercury was <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> world, 'I am what I am. So what?' And that in itself for some was a statement." [...] In an article for AfterElton, Robert Urban stated: [...] "Mercury did not ally himself to 'political outness,' or to LGBT causes." ...|$|E

Thant, at the urging of the United States, considered making contact with Tshombe to negotiate. Bunche advised against this, <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> secretary-general, [...] " [...] is maneuvering in every possible way to get some recognition. His position, after all, is only that of a provincial president, and now, for the first time, he is reduced to size. He should be kept there."

500|$|The unsafe {{homeless}} {{man with whom}} Peter was seen leaving a youth-baseball team in Stewie's flashback was originally based on John Wayne Gacy, but people claimed he didn't look scary enough, so Povenmire changed the character completely {{to that of a}} {{homeless man}}. The idea of Stewie and Bertram laughing as they go down the slide during their sword fight was pitched by Povenmire's wife and, although negative about the idea at first, Povenmire included it in the episode because the original sketch was not going so well. During Peter and Lois' [...] "fat sex", Peter repeatedly states [...] "almost, almost"; originally, {{there was going to be}} approximately twice as many of these, but they were never included in the episode. The DVD version of the episode shows Peter arriving at the sperm bank and <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> receptionist: [...] "I have an appointment to banish a White Russian from my Kremlin", to which she replies with [...] "This is a sperm bank, you don't have to use innuendo", and Peter concludes the conversation with [...] "Where do I splooge?".|$|E

500|$|Whorf {{graduated}} from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1918 {{with a degree in}} chemical engineering where his academic performance was of average quality. In 1920 he married Celia Inez Peckham, who became the mother of his three children, Raymond Ben, Robert Peckham and Celia Lee. Around the same time he began work as a fire prevention engineer (an inspector) for the Hartford Fire Insurance Company. He was particularly good at the job and was highly commended by his employers. His job required him to travel to production facilities throughout New England to be inspected. One anecdote describes him arriving at a chemical plant in which he was denied access by the director because he would not allow anyone to see the production procedure which was a trade secret. Having been told what the plant produced, Whorf wrote a chemical formula on a piece of paper, <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> director: [...] "I think this is what you're doing". The surprised director asked Whorf how he knew about the secret procedure, and he simply answered: [...] "You couldn't do it in any other way." ...|$|E
500|$|George Formby {{was born}} George Hoy Booth at 3 Westminster Street, Wigan, Lancashire, on 26 May 1904. He was {{the eldest of}} seven {{surviving}} children born to James Lawler Booth and his wife Eliza, [...] Hoy, although this marriage was bigamous because Formby Sr was still married to his first wife, Martha Maria Salter, a twenty-year-old music hall performer. Booth was a successful music hall comedian and singer who performed under the name George Formby (he {{is now known as}} George Formby Sr). Formby Sr suffered from a chest ailment, identified variously as bronchitis, asthma or tuberculosis, and would use the cough as part of the humour in his act, <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> audience, [...] "Bronchitis, I'm a bit tight tonight", or [...] "coughing better tonight". One of his main characters was that of John Willie, an [...] "archetypal Lancashire lad". In 1906 Formby Sr was earning £35 a week at the music halls, which rose to £325 a week by 1920, and Formby grew up in an affluent home. Formby Sr was so popular that Marie Lloyd, the influential music hall singer and actress, would only watch two acts: his and that of Dan Leno.|$|E
500|$|The Giants {{were founded}} in 1925 by Tim Mara, a {{bookmaker}} (legal in 1925), businessman, and promoter, with {{an investment of}} US$500 after a meeting with league president Joseph Carr, and Harry March. Carr {{was sent to the}} east coast to find someone to put a team in a major city there to help the struggling league. Carr contacted Billy Gibson who was the manager of heavyweight boxer Gene Tunney and knew of Mara from Mara's interest in investing in Tunney. Mara decided to spend the $500 on the Giants as opposed to Tunney in a spur of the moment decision, and started the team with the statement, [...] "an exclusive franchise for anything in New York is worth $500." [...] His son Wellington later said that his father felt that even an empty store in the city was worth that price. Mara purchased the team, despite never having watched a single pro game, <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sellers at the time, [...] "Just tell me one thing. Now that I have a franchise, what do I do with it." [...] To differentiate themselves from the baseball team of the same name, they took the name [...] "New York Football Giants", which they still use as their legal corporate name.|$|E
