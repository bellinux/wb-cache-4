50|$|Gedung Kuning is presumably {{built on}} pad {{foundations}} made of mass masonry. If {{it was built}} on a <b>strip</b> <b>foundation,</b> it will run underneath and support the load-bearing walls. Pad foundation made of mass masonry typically consists of several layers of bricks where the lowest layer is usually twice {{the breadth of the}} wall above and the total height of the footings is about twoIthirds of the breadth of the wall. Masonry foundations were usually made from 75 x 215 x 100 mm burnt clay bricks bonded together with lime mortar, which makes it porous and less rigid, giving the foundation more tolerance to differential settlement as compared to cement mortar. As a result, the building will not have much cracks or fissures over the years, as the case of Gedung Kuning. However, the columns along Kandahar Street were built out of pad foundations made out of reinforced concrete.|$|E
5000|$|Gedung Kuning {{is built}} {{primarily}} on a load-bearing wall. The wall bears {{the weight of}} the house and transfers the load to the foundation structure. This is similar to the party walls in a shophouse. The load-bearing walls demarcate each room of Gedung Kuning as how party walls demarcate each shophouse. As party walls are also known as firewalls, the load-bearing walls of Gedung Kuning serve similar functions by creating a barrier and preventing the spread of fire between or through each rooms. A party wall is usually extended above the roof level to ensure its effectiveness but this does not exist in Gedung Kuning as it is a standalone house. However, this idea is evident on the Gedung Kuning’s walkway on Kandahar Street when the boundary wall is extended onto the walkway. This is probably erected {{to prevent the spread of}} fire between Gedung Kuning and the former Kota Raja Club. The walls of Gedung Kuning are constructed using brickwork construction method and plastered for a smooth finish and painted over. The wall has a uniform thickness throughout the two levels. The load-bearing walls are supported on the foundation. There are several non-structural wall used to partition room. Usually, the load-bearing walls are supported on a continuous <b>strip</b> <b>foundation</b> while a column rests on brick footings, which were in turn supported on bakau (mangrove) timber piles.Lime mortar [...] is usually used in the construction of the brickwork in early buildings and due to the damp evaporation ability, which slows down the proliferation of the spalling of surface finishes, such as plaster and paintwork, caused by accumulated damp inside the structural element as compared to cement mortar used in later construction.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} dynamic {{response}} of shallow foundations on linear and nonlinear soil medium using finite element method. The study {{was motivated by}} the need to develop macroscopic foundation models that can realistically capture the nonlinear behavior and energy dissipation mechanism of shallow foundations. An infinitely long <b>strip</b> <b>foundation</b> resting on soil half-space is analyzed in depth to evaluate the dependence of its dynamic responses on various parameters, e. g. foundation width, material properties, input motion amplitude and frequency etc. Special attentions are paid to choose appropriate domain scale, mesh size and boundary conditions so as to minimize the often observed numerical oscillations when the outgoing waves are contaminated by the reflecting waves at boundaries. Such judicious choice results in an excellent agreement between the finite element analysis and the analytical solution of <b>strip</b> <b>foundation</b> on linear soil half-space. Closed-form formulas are developed to describe the frequency-dependent linear dynamic stiffness of <b>strip</b> <b>foundation</b> along both horizontal and vertical directions. Various nonlinear constitutive models of soil, which exhibit the yielding and kinematic hardening behavior of soil, are implemented in this study to evaluate the dynamic stiffness of <b>strip</b> <b>foundation</b> sitting on nonlinear soil medium. The finite element analyses reveal the strong dependency of response on input motion amplitude, frequency and yielding of soil. A nonlinearity indicator is developed to incorporate the combined effects of initial elastic stiffness, yielding stress and excitation amplitude. The numerical analyses presented here provide improved understanding on the nonlinear behavior and energy dissipation mechanism of shallow foundations under dynamic loads...|$|E

This paper {{presents}} an accurate analytical method {{to obtain the}} rocking impedance function of a surface-supported <b>strip</b> <b>foundation.</b> The Green’s functions of the elastic half-space under concentrated or uniform loads with infinite length are derived and an elaborate integration method {{is used to calculate}} the multi-value improper integral. The interface between the foundation and the supporting medium is divided into a number of strip units.

Excellent convergence has been observed. Comparing the numerical results to those obtained by the thin layer method, good agreements are achieved.
