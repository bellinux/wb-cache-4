5000|$|This {{may seem}} odd. After all, if the axle were {{shifting}} in a horizontal groove, the friction {{on one end}} that acts {{to speed up the}} rotation would be canceled by the friction at the other end, operating in the opposite direction. The difference is that a torque is being applied, so one end of the axle is pushing against one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>groove,</b> while the other end is pushing against the other side. Likewise, it does not matter in which direction the torque is applied. If the torque is reversed, each end of the axle will then be pressing against the opposite <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>groove,</b> but the direction of precession is also reversed. The only restriction is that the relative speed of the surface of the axle and the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> due to precession, , must exceed the relative speed due to the rotation of the spinning mass, [...] The minimum torque required to meet this condition is , where I is the moment of inertia of the spinning mass, and ω is its angular velocity.|$|E

50|$|Since the {{spinning}} mass is balanced, the only possibility {{to speed up}} the rotation is for <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> to exert forces on <b>the</b> ends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> axle.

50|$|During early {{development}} of the vertebrate embryo, a longitudinal groove on the neural plate gradually deepens and the ridges on either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> (the neural folds) become elevated, and ultimately meet, transforming the groove into a closed tube called the neural tube. The formation of the neural tube is called neurulation. At this stage, {{the walls of the}} neural tube contain proliferating neural stem cells in a region called the ventricular zone. The neural stem cells, principally radial glial cells, multiply and generate neurons through the process of neurogenesis, forming the rudiment of the central nervous system.|$|E
50|$|Since an {{acceleration}} of the rotation will occur regardless of {{the direction of the}} applied torque, {{as long as it is}} large enough, the device will function without any fine-tuning of the driving motion. The tilting of the shell does not have to have a particular phase relationship with the precession or even to have the same frequency. Since sliding (kinetic) friction is usually nearly as strong as static (sticking) friction, it is also not necessary to apply precisely the value of torque which will result in the axle rolling without slipping along the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>groove.</b> These factors allow beginners to learn to speed up the rotation after only a few minutes of practice.|$|E

50|$|Another {{problem is}} in the {{tapering}} along a straight line, while the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> is far from straight. Both problems were attacked together: by polishing the diamond {{in a certain way}} that it could be made doubly elliptic. 1) the side was made into one ellipse as seen from behind, meaning the groove touched along a short line and 2) the ellipse form was also polished as seen from above and curvature {{in the direction of the}} groove became much smaller than 25 micrometers e.g. 13 micrometers. With this approach a number of irregularities were eliminated. Furthermore, the angle of the stylus, which used to be always sloping backwards, was changed into the forward direction, in line with the slope the original cutting stylus possessed. These styli were expensive to produce, but the costs were effectively offset by their extended lifespans.|$|E

5000|$|In 1843 Matthäus Hipp first {{mentioned}} a purely mechanical clock {{being driven by}} a switch called [...] "echappement à palette". A varied version of that escapement has been used from the 1860s inside electrically driven pendulum clocks, the so-called [...] "hipp-toggle". Since the 1870s in an improved version the pendulum drove a ratchet wheel via a pawl on the pendulum rod, and the ratchet wheel drove {{the rest of the}} clock train to indicate the time. The pendulum was not impelled on every swing or even at a set interval of time. It was only impelled when its arc of swing had decayed below a certain level. As well as the counting pawl, the pendulum carried a small vane, known as a Hipp's toggle, pivoted at the top, which was completely free to swing. It was placed so that it dragged across a triangular polished block with a vee-groove in the top of it. When the arc of swing of the pendulum was large enough, the vane crossed the groove and swung free on the other side. If the arc was too small the vane never left the far <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>groove,</b> and when the pendulum swung back it pushed the block strongly downwards. The block carried a contact which completed the circuit to the electromagnet which impelled the pendulum. The pendulum was only impelled as required.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This article {{deals with}} the problem of {{assisting}} disc cutters by means of high-velocity jets of water, with the aim of increasing the excavation rate while improving the working conditions, with particular reference to wear. The results of an experimental research undertaken at the Waterjet Laboratory of the University of Cagliari on a medium–hard abrasive rock clearly show that a higher removal rate is achieved owing to the weakening action of a jet directed {{on one side of the}} disc, causing deeper penetration. This outcome is interpreted on the basis of the scale formation model, which explains why smaller scales are obtained on the water jet’s <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>groove.</b> Accordingly, it is suggested that the results can be further improved if the jet is directed ahead of the tool along the same path, since, in this way, larger scales can be produced on both sides...|$|E

These states are characterized by different curvatures of the meniscus. The measured free energy barrier separating the Cassie-Baxter from the Wenzel state (and vice versa) largely exceeds the thermal energy, attesting the existence of Cassie-Baxter/Wenzel metastabilities.

Four biologically inactive mutant proteins (Arg 32 [...] Trp, Leu 36 [...] Phe, Ser 86 [...] Phe and Ala 84 [...] Val) behaved similar to the wild-type in various physico-chemical assays. The residues were positioned on a 3 D structural model and were found to cluster together {{at the base of}} the molecule at each <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> that separates two monomers in the trimeric structure. A very conservative mutation at one of these sites (Ala 84 [...] Val) almost completely abolished cytotoxic activity. Amino acid alterations in three other residues in close proximity to this receptor binding site were introduced: replacements at positions 29 and 146 clearly reduced cytotoxicity only when non-conservative alterations were introduced (Leu 29 [...] Ser and Glu 146 [...] Lys), suggesting an indirect influence on the active site. However, a conservative mutation at position 91 (Val [...] Ala) caused a significant drop (500 -fold) in bioactivity which suggests that Val 91 may also play a direct role in receptor recognition.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is {{to assist in the}} {{development}} of a low cost nanopositioner by designing a specific component - a shim that is located in the scan tip assembly of the nanopositioner. Nanopositioners must maximize precision to successfully produce features of fewer than 100 nm. The kinematic coupling used to place the tool tip is capable of producing a high level of precision across tool changes, assuming the groove mount is held in place. It is therefore very important to secure the groove mount to prevent dislocation and enhance the viability of nano-scale device fabrication. The shim developed within this thesis serves to secure the groove mount of the kinematic coupling, which was previously held in place solely with magnetic attraction. The shim secures the groove mount by applying a force to the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> mount in addition to increasing the magnetic attraction between the groove mount and universal mount of the nanopositioner. It was first modeled with solid and magnetic modeling software before being manufactured and tested. With the addition of the shim, the vertical force required to displace the groove mount increased by a factor of 9. 4, from 0. 14 N to 1. 29 N. Similarly the lateral force increased by a factor of 27. 9, from 0. 09 N to 2. 45 N. As a result, the nanopositioner is significantly better suited to perform its function. The nanopositioner will be used to produce nano-scale devices including carbon nanotubes, molecular actuators, and transistors, with applications across several disciplines. Future work includes developing a tool to bend the shim tabs and simplify the manufacturing process. by Corey G. Harris. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|AbstractBackground: Polyamide drugs, such as netropsin, distamycin {{and their}} lexitropsin derivatives, can be {{inserted}} {{into a narrow}} B-DNA minor groove to form 1 : 1 complexes that can distinguish AT base pairs from GC, but cannot detect end-for-end base-pair reversals such as TA for AT. In contrast, 2 : 1 side-by-side polyamide drug complexes potentially are capable of such discrimination. Imidazole (Im) and pyrrole (Py) rings side-by-side read a GC base pair with the Im ring recognizing the guanine side. But {{the reason for this}} specific G–Im association is unclear because the guanine NH 2 group sits {{in the center of the}} groove. A 2 : 1 drug:DNA complex that presents Im at both ends of a GC base pair should help unscramble the issue of imidazole reading specificity. Results: We have determined the crystal structure of a 2 : 1 complex of a di-imidazole lexitropsin (DIM), an analogue of distamycin, and a DNA decamer with the sequence C-A-T-G-G-C-C-A-T-G. The two DIM molecules sit antiparallel to one another in a broad minor groove, with their cationic tails widely separated. Im rings of one drug molecule stack against amide groups of the other. DIM 1 rests against nucleotides C 7 A 8 T 9 G 10 of strand 1 of the helix, whereas DIM 2 rests against G 14 G 15 C 16 C 17 on strand 2. All DIM amide nitrogens donate hydrogen bonds to N and O atoms on the floor of the DNA groove and, in addition, the two Im rings on DIM 2 accept hydrogen bonds from guanine N 2 amines, thereby providing specific reading. The guanine N 2 amine can bond to Im on its own <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>groove,</b> but not on the cytosine side, because of limits on close approach of the two Im rings and the geometry of sp 2 hybridization about the amide nitrogen. Conclusions: Im and Py rings distinguish AT from GC base pairs because of steric factors involving the bulk of the guanine amine, and the ability of Im to form a hydrogen bond with the amine. Side-by-side Im and Py rings differentiate GC from CG base pairs because of tight steric contacts and sp 2 hybridization at the amine nitrogen atom, with the favored conformations being G/Im,Py/C and C/Py,Im/G. Discrimination between AT and TA base pairs may be possible using bulkier rings, such as thiazole to select the A end of the base pair...|$|E
30|$|Two scratch directions, {{forward and}} backward, were {{selected}} to scratch the Si surface. As illustrated in Figure 1 a, forward scratch has the sharp cutting edge along the scratch direction, while the backward scratch uses the flat cutting edge facing the scratch direction. <b>The</b> influence <b>of</b> scratch direction on <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scratched geometry was initially investigated. <b>The</b> AFM images <b>of</b> <b>the</b> typical <b>grooves</b> in both directions are given in Figure 1 b, along with the corresponding cross-section profiles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grooves</b> as shown in Figure 1 c, where the scratch was performed at 1 μm/s <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scratching speed and 10 μN <b>of</b> <b>the</b> applied normal force. The cross-section profiles are V-shaped in both scratch conditions. However, <b>the</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> generated in <b>the</b> forward scratch is clearly deeper than that in the backward direction, as seen in Figure 1 c. This {{could be attributed to}} <b>the</b> sharpness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tip in the forward direction, where the effective normal force was higher and a deeper groove was thus produced [27]. A similar phenomenon was observed in <b>the</b> investigation <b>of</b> AFM scratch on Si surface with diamond-coated Si tip [22 – 24, 28]. The pyramidal tip has three scratching faces as shown in Figure 1 d, the inclination angle, θ, is defined as the angle between <b>the</b> directions <b>of</b> scratching and cutting face. In <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> backward direction, the tip scratch face is perpendicular to the scratch direction, i.e., the inclination angle, θ, equals 90 °, which satisfies the requirement to become orthogonal cutting. The protuberances are created evenly along two <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>grooves.</b> On <b>the</b> other hand, if scratching is in the forward direction, the scratching face is composed of two inclination angles, i.e., one is - 30 ° and the other is 30 °. As a result, the protuberances are squeezed evenly onto <b>the</b> two <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>groove</b> scratched. Since <b>the</b> 30 ° or - 30 ° inclination angle provides much more favorable stress states to squeeze the materials onto the two sides as compared with that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 90 ° inclination angle, the protuberances created in forward scratching is more or larger than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> backward direction.|$|R
