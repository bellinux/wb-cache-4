5000|$|Leather {{is added}} {{on all sides}} of the tree to create the <b>seat,</b> <b>flaps</b> and panels. Cowhide is usually used, though pigskin and other leathers are also seen. The panels on the {{underside}} of the saddle traditionally are stuffed with wool flock, which is still preferred and used on the highest quality saddles. Synthetic materials, including foam and fiberfill materials, are used on more moderately priced saddles, and one company currently sells a design that uses airtight sealed panels that are inflated with air.|$|R

50|$|Ultra Luggage: In certain markets, Honda {{offers the}} Fit/Jazz without a spare tire, a system marketed as Ultra Luggage, where the spare tire well {{is used as}} part of a 'Tall' mode cargo area behind the rear <b>seats.</b> A {{flexible}} <b>flap</b> allows three configurations of rear storage: Regular, Tall and Upper/Lower mode.|$|R
50|$|As built, {{the normal}} seating {{capacity}} was 45, 21 in 1st class and 24 in 2nd class. A further seven could be accommodated on the <b>flap</b> <b>seats</b> {{provided in the}} guard's compartment. An additional feature of these cars were the prized seats {{either side of the}} driver (the drivers cab being centrally located {{in the middle of the}} carriage, there was one passenger seat located either side of the cab, looking directly ahead).|$|R
50|$|Safety in NASCAR {{has evolved}} {{into one of the}} biggest {{concerns}} in stock car racing's largest sanctioning body. Mainly after the death of Dale Earnhardt, a seven time Winston Cup Series champion, NASCAR has decided to change all of their safety policies, {{such as the use of}} the HANS device. Since 2001, NASCAR has also changed the cars for the Sprint Cup Series and the Xfinity Series. NASCAR's safety policy includes the racing fire suit, carbon fiber <b>seating,</b> and roof <b>flaps.</b>|$|R
50|$|Changes in the B95 version {{included}} a 19 in cabin stretch to increase rear cabin {{area and the}} horizontal stabilizer and elevators were enlarged for better pitch control. A curved vertical stabilizer dorsal fairing is the most noticeable change. It also {{included a}} fifth <b>seat,</b> wider chord <b>flaps,</b> and an increased gross weight of 100 pounds. The 1961 Model B95A featured fuel injected Lycoming IO-360-B1A engines. A total 150 B95's were built in 1960, and 81 B95A's were built between 1961 and 1962 (serial numbers TD-453 through TD-533). The 1960 model was priced at $51,500 and the 1961-62 model was priced at $49,500.|$|R
50|$|The basic {{configuration}} of the PL-2 incorporates two-place, side by side seating, a low wing of rectangular plan form, and tricycle landing gear. The overall layout is compact and light compared with some other contemporary aircraft in the same category. The structure is stressed to + 6 g’s limit for safety and aerobatics. Aluminum 2024-T3 is the basic material. Landing gear and engine mount are made from 4130 steel tubes and plates. There are no double curvature skins in the whole airplane. Very few formed blocks are necessary, considering that the wing and horizontal tail have constant chord.The wing has a 15% thickness laminar airfoil, with the single spar located at the maximum thickness and is assembled as a unit to the fuselage and can be removed in approximately two hours.The wing-fuselage connection is provided by two bolts at the main spar and two bolts at the rear spar. The seats form an integral structure with the wing. Also, the control sticks and flap control lever are directly attached to the wing structure. The elevator trim {{is located in a}} center box between the <b>seats.</b> Aileron and <b>flaps</b> are piano-hinged to the bottom skin. The elevator trim is located in a center box between the <b>seats.</b> Aileron and <b>flaps</b> are piano hinged to the bottom skin. Ailerons are mass-balanced and push-pull controlled, having differential displacement. The flaps run through the fuselage and have three positions.|$|R
50|$|There {{are even}} special, {{problem-solving}} voice prosthesis, e.g. for laryngectomized patients with very short device life times (less than 4 to 8 weeks) {{of their current}} prosthesis. Those extremely short device life times {{may be caused by}} excessive candida growth, so that the valve of the prosthesis does not close properly anymore and content from the food pipe leaks through the voice prosthesis into the windpipe. Some of these prostheses have a magnet within the valve that strengthens the closure, others are made of silver oxide silicone to reduce biofilm formation on the valve or use two valves, in case of defect of the esophageal valve, the other valve would seal. In patients with a short device life, the use of a voice prosthesis with supporting magnets in the valve <b>seat</b> and valve <b>flap</b> has been proven to be cost effective.|$|R
5000|$|The seat of this saddle {{is longer}} and flatter {{than that of}} a forward seat or {{dressage}} saddle. The seat places the rider's center of balance farther back on the horse than in other English riding disciplines, though correct saddle seat equitation still demands that the rider's legs and feet be balanced under the horse. The pommel is always cut back to allow greater freedom of the front legs and shoulder, as well as to accommodate the higher set neck and higher withers typical of the saddle <b>seat</b> breeds. The <b>flap</b> is wide front-to-back, with no blocks or rolls beneath, and ends closer to the cantle than any other English saddle so that the rider's leg (whose thigh is further back than in other styles because the seat is also farther back) is protected. Riders use very long stirrups, usually at least as long as those of dressage riders.|$|R
5000|$|The {{summer of}} 1846 was {{exceptionally}} hot and dry, and serious difficulties with the traction pipe flap valve started to show themselves. It {{was essential to}} make a good seal when the leather flap was closed, and the weather conditions made the leather stiff. As for the tallow and beeswax compound that was supposed to seal the joint after every train, Samuda had originally said [...] "this composition is solid at the temperature of the atmosphere, and becomes fluid when heated a few degrees above it" [...] and the hot weather had that effect. Samuda's original description of his system had included a metal weather valve that closed over the flap, but this had been omitted on the L&CR, exposing the valve to the weather, and also encouraging the ingestion of debris, including, an observer reported, a handkerchief dropped by a lady on to the track. Any debris lodging in the <b>seating</b> of the <b>flap</b> could only have reduced its effectiveness.|$|R
40|$|After total laryngectomy, voice can be {{restored}} with a silicone rubber tracheoesophageal voice prosthesis. However, biofilm formation and subsequent {{deterioration of the}} silicone material of the prosthesis will limit device life by impairing valve function. To simulate the natural process of biofilm development under dynamic nutrient conditions, a modified Robbins device {{was used to evaluate}} the biofilm-related valve dysfunction of the Groningen, Provox 2, Blom-Singer indwelling, and VoiceMaster voice prostheses. Obstruction of the semicircular slit-valved Groningen prosthesis leading to increased airway resistance was caused not only by a buildup of deposits on the esophageal flange and valve hat, but also by accumulation of deposits on the semicircular valve <b>seating.</b> The hinged <b>flap</b> valved Provox 2 and indwelling Blom-Singer prostheses failed to close sufficiently because of biofilm formation on the valve seating. The esophageal flange of the VoiceMaster prosthesis was affected, but the tripod structure of the ball valve was fully colonized up to the titanium sleeve, which interfered with proper valve opening and closure. These findings on biofilm formation could be used for the further development and modification of critical design features of voice prostheses to facilitate tracheoesophageall speech.

50|$|The {{differences}} between the styles of English saddle are small but significant. The most important distinctions are the location and therefore {{the balance of the}} <b>seat,</b> and the <b>flap</b> length and shape. A saddle used for a discipline where the rider sits more upright with a longer leg, such as in dressage, has a flap that is longer to accommodate the leg, and less inclined forward (as the knee does not need to go forward). The seat will also be closer to the withers, to keep the rider's center of gravity in the correct spot. However, in disciplines where the rider needs shorter stirrups for better balance and security, such as in the jumping disciplines, the saddle flap is moved proportionately forward and shortened, and the seat is moved further back. A jumping saddle will have a shorter and more forward flap than a dressage saddle, with the seat slightly more towards the cantle. If the flap was not inclined forward, the rider’s knee would hang over the flap, and the flap would constantly push the leg out of position (usually backward), so that the rider would become unstable and interfere with his horse. If the seat was not moved rearward, the rider would be forced ahead of the saddle over a fence. A racing saddle, where jockeys ride with incredibly short stirrups, will have an extremely forward and short saddle flap (almost more horizontal than vertical), and the seat will be extended well back from the pommel to keep the rider’s center of gravity correctly situated.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is to provide a}} robust and {{efficient}} method to design a flap assembly to be resistant to a full scale experimental bird strike in according to the airworthiness certifications. In particular this paper analyses the full assembly of a CFRP flap including wing track attachments ready to be tested a birdstrike scenario. Before to introduce the impact simulations on the entire flap, a dedicated model calibration, which fully reflect ASTM procedure of tensile and compression tests have been prepared and simulation results, have been compared with typical experimental tests expected for a CFRP material. Furthermore the dimensioning of the roller carriages, which are the links between the flap tracks, has represented a critical issue in the interference aspects between the flap and the wing box, then a detailed evaluation of the links allowed to size the fixture for a fullscale test case. Using of an iterative approach, all failure parameter requested have been properly tuned. Then the calibration impact projectile is introduced to study the interaction between the bird (equivalent gelatine) and the target including the equation of state and contacts. Flap object of this work is equipped on a medium rage turbojet aircraft of about one hundred twenty <b>seats.</b> The <b>flap</b> model is a single slotted flap fixed to the main component with two tracks respectively, staring from the wing root. The impact condition presents for all flap deflections not affected by wing, fan cowl and track shadow. This paper present the analysis of bird strike with flap assembled on wing tracks. For this particular topic, a dedicated session has been developed in order to apply the most representative track installation. Finally an extensive campaign of impacts were performed on the inboard flap. Particular attention on the track zones is dedicated when the flap is fully opened. These zones are very critical because failure of links is a failure of complete systems. Results of the impacts analysis are presented in terms of visual damage and history forces reaction on link and carriage. Moreover the strain of the most critical items will be surveyed (rear spar damage). Result overview allows the selection of the bird impact points based on links and composite failure criteria, in particular on the flap tracks metallic attachments, and lower skin and rear spar damage; Result of current work have allowed to establish robust criteria and to define most critical impact points need to be investigated by means of a strike test. Reducing number of shots a two location allow laboratories to perform test bus using of a unique test specimen saving time and cost. The conclusion of this activity is dedicated a comparison of test result performed and relevant analysis. For the two shots strain gauge and force reaction history acquisition will be compared...|$|R
