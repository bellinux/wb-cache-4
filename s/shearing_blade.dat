50|$|In New Zealand, {{there are}} still {{approximately}} 40 commercial blade shearers who work between July and October each year. Between these shearers, 400,000 sheep are shorn each year in New Zealand, mostly in Otago and the Canterbury high country. Blade shearers in New Zealand usually travel to sheds in groups of 5 or 6 shearers and usually live on the station during shearing. Often they will stay on the station {{for up to a}} week shearing around 1000 sheep per day. Most of the sheep that are blade shorn in New Zealand are fine wooled Merino. The main reason sheep are still blade shorn in New Zealand is due to the harsh climate at the time of <b>shearing.</b> <b>Blade</b> shearing leaves a thicker cover of wool on the sheep after shearing giving it more protection from storms and also the wool grows back faster after blade shearing than machine shearing.|$|E
50|$|Most proborhyaenids had a robust, hyena-like skull, {{although}} one species, Callistoe vincei, had an elongate, narrow skull more {{reminiscent of a}} thylacine. The teeth were strongly specialized as carnassials for eating meat, and in Arminiheringia rotated throughout the animal's life to maintain a continuous <b>shearing</b> <b>blade</b> on the tooth. Preserved specimens of their canines lack enamel; in life, the enamel may have been very thin or restricted to the tooth tips. In the genus Arminiheringia the lower canines are protruding. Proborhyaenids can be distinguished from other sparassodonts by their grooved upper and lower canines, which grew continuously throughout the animals' lives like rodent incisors. Bond and Pascual (1983) argued that proborhyaenid canines stopped growing in late adulthood based on a specimen from Mendoza Province, Argentina, but the proborhyaenid identity of this specimen is disputed.

50|$|On 23 March 2011, BOEMRE and the Coast Guard {{published}} the forensic examination report prepared by U.S. Det Norske Veritas (DNV) Columbus, the contractor that performed the examination. The report {{concluded that the}} primary cause of failure was that the blind shear rams failed to fully close and seal due to a portion of drill pipe trapped between the shearing blocks. This happened because the drill pipe elastically buckled within the wellbore due to forces induced on the drill pipe during loss of well control, consequently, drill pipe in process of shearing was deformed outside the <b>shearing</b> <b>blade</b> surfaces, and, consequently, the blind shearing rams were not able to move the entire pipe cross section into the shearing surfaces of the blades. Therefore, oil continued to flow through the drill pipe trapped between the ram block faces and subsequently through the gaps between the ram blocks. Since the pipe buckled when well control was lost, the blind shear rams would have failed to function as planned no matter when they were made active.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} to {{investigate}} the effects of addition self synthesised multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), to the final properties of polypropylene (PP) matrix nanocomposites. The influences of melt blending parameters were evaluated, where the interrelationship between the temperatures of compounding and roller rotor speed of <b>shearing</b> <b>blade</b> parameter, to the tensile properties of fabricated composites were studied. MWCNT was synthesised in the laboratory scale; by using the floating catalyst chemical vapour deposition (FC-CVD) method. Pre-compounding work is begun with de-agglomeration of MWCNT which carried out by combining the ultrasonication and mechanical stirrer means simultaneously. Carbon nanotubes produced was first verified by using SEM and TEM imaging microscopy techniques. It was later integrated with the thermoplastic PP matrix, via melt blending process through internally mixing approach. Very low weight percentage of chemically untreated MWCNT (0, 0. 25, 0. 50, 0. 75 & 1. 00 wt. %) was added into PP and later was compression moulded to the thin sheet of composites film. Composites were prepared by varying the compounding temperature into three processing temperature namely 165, 175 & 185 Â°C and also into three shearing speed of roller rotor blade, 40, 60 & 80 rpm respectively. Later, it was mechanically tested via tensile testing following the ASTM D- 638 standard method. The interrelationship between each parameter of compounding to the mechanical tensile properties was tested. It was shown that, the additional of very low loading of untreated-MWCNT filler content, does give moderate effects on reinforcement to the tensile properties of composite.

40|$|Objectives: The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate the optimal method of enhancing the bond strength of a composite resin to the facial surface of the primary anterior stainless steel crowns using various surface treatments namely Nd: YAG laser surface treatment, sandblasting, alloy primer application and no surface treatment. Study Design: The study sample consisted of 60 primary anterior stainless steel crowns (UnitekTM size R 4), with 15 samples randomly divided into the 4 study groups, embedded in acrylic blocks. The facial surface of these surface treated crowns was utilized as the bonding surface to which 2. 5 mm diameter composite resin cylinders were bonded for the evaluation of the shear bond strength. Shear bond strength measurements were made using a universal testing machine utilizing a <b>shearing</b> <b>blade</b> (jig). The mode of failure at composite-metal interface was determined using a Stereomicroscope at 10 X magnification. Results: The mean bond strength values obtained for surface treatment of Nd: YAG laser surface treated, Sandblasting, Alloy Primer and No surface treatments were 17. 01 Â±. 92, 13. 18 Â±. 73, 7. 46 Â±. 70 and 7. 33 Â±. 77 MPa respectively. The obtained bond strength values were subjected to a one way ANOVA and a Scheffe's post-hoc comparison test. The {{results of the present study}} indicated that Laser surface treatment of the facial surface of the crowns enhanced the bond strength of the composite resin significantly compared to the other groups. Conclusions: Nd: YAG laser surface treatment produced an excellent surface roughness and obtained the highest shear bond strength values suggestive for recommendation as an optimal surface treatment to be used to enhance the resin-metal bond at the interface of the composite resin and the facial surface of primary anterior stainless steel crowns for the purpose of chairside veneering...|$|E

Separation skin from the melon flesh with their subsequent destination application {{in the creation of}} new food products is one of the time-consuming operations in this technology. Lack of scientific and experimental base of this operation holding back the development of high-performance machines for its implementation. In this connection, the technique of the experiment on the separation of the skins of melons in the pilot plant and the search for optimal regimes of its work methods by statistical modeling is offered. The late-ripening species of melon: Kalaysan, Thorlami, Gulab-sary are objects of study. Interaction of factors influencing on separating the melon skins process is carried out. A central composite rotatable design and fractional factorial experiment was used. Using the method of experimental design with treatment planning template in Design Expert v. 10 software yielded a regression equations that adequately describe the actual process. Rational intervals input factors values are established: the ratio of the rotational speed of the drum to the abrasive supply roll rotational frequency; the gap between the supply drum and the shearing knife; <b>shearing</b> <b>blade</b> sharpening angle; the number of feed drum spikes; abrading drum orifices diameter. The mean square error does not exceed 12. 4 %. Regression equations graphic interpretation is presented by scatter plots and engineering nomograms that can be predictive of a choice of rational values of the input factors for three optimization criteria: minimal specific energy consumption in the process of cutting values, maximal specific performance by the pulp and pulp extraction ratio values.

40|$|Background and Aim: Achieving {{adhesion}} between restorative {{materials and}} dentin as a wet and dynamic surface {{is an important}} topic in restorative and especially in conservative dentistry. Adhesion of new dentin bonding systems depends on the formation of hybrid layer and micromechanical retention. Nevertheless, an ideal adhesive system {{has not yet been}} introduced. Recent studies reveal an increase in bonding stability when the collagen is removed from demineralized dentin surfaces. This study investigates the effect of collagen removal on the shear bond strength of four single bottle dentin bonding systems regarding their structural differences. Materials and Methods: This experimental study was performed on 56 intact human premolar teeth. Smooth surfaces of dentin were prepared on buccal & lingual aspects of teeth, providing 112 dentin surfaces. The dentin surfaces were etched with 37 % phosphoric acid for 15 seconds and then rinsed. The specimens were divided into 8 groups. Single bottle adhesive systems [Single Bond (3 M), One-Step (Bisco), Prime & Bond NT (Dentsply), and Excite (Vivadent) ] were then applied on the dentin surfaces of 4 groups using the wet bonding technique. In the other 4 groups, the demineralized dentin surfaces were treated with a 5. 25 % solution of sodium hypochlorite for one minute in order to remove the surface organic components. The adhesive systems mentioned before were applied to these 4 groups with the same wet bonding technique. A cylinder of Z 100 (3 M) dental composite with a 3 mm diameter and 2 mm height was placed on the adhesive covered dentin surface of all groups and light-cured (400 mW/cm 2, 40 sec on each side). The specimens were kept in distilled water at room temperature for one week and then thermocycled for 3000 times (5 - 55 oc). Shear bond strength of specimens was measured using an Instron (1495) universal mechanical testing machine with cross-head speed of 0. 5 mm/minute and chisel form <b>shearing</b> <b>blade.</b> Data were analyzed by Two Way ANOVA and Tukey HSD tests with p 0. 05). Conclusion: Based on the results of this study, collagen removal from demineralized dentin surface caused a significant decrease in shear bond strength of alcohol & water/alcohol based bonding systems, while the bonding strength of the acetone based systems was not affected. Therefore, the effect of collagen removal on shear bond strength depends on the bonding system applied and its solvent type...|$|E
