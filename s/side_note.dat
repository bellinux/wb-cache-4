25|$|Throughout {{his writing}} Mailer never {{presents}} {{a very clear}} perspective on race.

25|$|Octopus card fares are {{calculated}} {{based on the}} minimum number of stops travelled (from origin to destination stops), rather {{than the number of}} fare zones travelled through. All stops have Octopus entry and exit processors at the entrances to and exits from platforms. Passengers may enter the system after placing their Octopus on the reader of an orange-coloured 'Entry Processor' reader. This action is known as validation. At this point, The maximum fare is deducted from the Octopus. On completion of a journey, the card previously read by an 'Entry Processor' must be placed on a dark-green coloured 'Exit Processor', where the maximum fare less the fare incurred is refunded. Failure to do so within the time limit would cause the fare difference to be forfeited. As a <b>side</b> <b>note,</b> if a person exits the same platform with the same Octopus card with 5 minutes, the fare deducted will be fully refunded.|$|E
25|$|In McCarney's sixth {{season the}} Cyclones were {{finally able to}} put {{together}} a competitive team. The 2000 Cyclones were quarterbacked by Sage Rosenfels.

Despite Iowa State being picked by the media to finish 5th in the Big 12 North Division, the Cyclones finished with a 5–3 conference record and a 9–3 overall record. ISU finished the season ranked #25 and their nine wins were a program best since 1906.

25|$|Phoenix {{appears in}} , voiced by Sarah Waits. She is a NPC for the PS2, Xbox, PS3, Xbox 360, Wii and PSP versions, {{and is a}} striker {{character}} in the Game Boy Advance version. In the PC and next-gen console versions, she is initially kidnapped by Arcade putting her under mind control and forces her to battle the player's team. After she is rescued, she assists the player's mission to rescue Nightcrawler from Mephisto's realm, only to be captured by Blackheart in the process. After defeating Blackheart, the player has the choice to save either Jean or Nightcrawler, since saving one results in the other's death. If Nightcrawler was rescued, then Jean will be resurrected by Mephisto (this will occur during the game). After you defeat Phoenix during the fight against Mephisto, Jean Grey-Summers dismisses herself as an echo of her past self and sacrifices her life to defeat Mephisto. In {{the end of the}} game, it is revealed if the player let Jean die, she will return as the Dark Phoenix and exact her revenge on those who did not save her. On a <b>side</b> <b>note,</b> she has special dialogue with Nightcrawler, Wolverine, Invisible Woman, and Cyclops. On the game's PC Version, Jean is available as a playable Mod character from Marvel Mods. There are several versions of Jean which give her different powersets. These include powersets from the 1990s, Morrison's Run, current Phoenix, Dark Phoenix, and Goblin Queen. She also has powersets based on her XML2 and MUA2 (both the Xbox 360/PS3 and the PSP/PS2/WII) versions.
