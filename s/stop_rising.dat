500|$|... "Stylish" [...] combat {{is defined}} as {{performing}} an unbroken series of varied attacks while avoiding damage, with player performance tracked by an on-screen gauge. The more hits the player makes, the higher the gauge rises. The gauge starts at [...] "Dull"; progresses through [...] "Cool", [...] "Bravo", and [...] "Absolute"; and peaks at [...] "Stylish". Repeatedly using the same moves causes the gauge to <b>stop</b> <b>rising,</b> forcing the player to use every move in their arsenal. The gauge terms {{are similar to the}} grades given {{at the end of the}} missions. When Dante receives damage, the style rating resets back to [...] "Dull". Players can also maintain their style grade by taunting enemies at close range.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the peak}} of the action {{potential}}, when enough Na+ has entered the neuron and the membrane's potential has become high enough, the Na+ channels inactivate themselves by closing their inactivation gates. The inactivation gate {{can be thought of as}} a [...] "plug" [...] tethered to domains III and IV of the channel's intracellular alpha subunit. Closure of the inactivation gate causes Na+ flow through the channel to stop, which in turn causes the membrane potential to <b>stop</b> <b>rising.</b> With its inactivation gate closed, the channel is said to be inactivated. With the Na+ channel no longer contributing to the membrane potential, the potential decreases back to its resting potential as the neuron repolarizes and subsequently hyperpolarizes itself. This decrease in voltage constitutes the falling phase of the action potential.|$|E

50|$|A Bunurong story {{tells of}} a time of {{conflict}} among the Kulin nations, when people argued and fought with one another, neglecting their families and the land. The mounting chaos and disunity angered the sea, which began to rise until it had covered the plains and threatened to flood the entire country. The people went to Bunjil {{and asked him to}} help them stop the sea from rising; Bunjil agreed to do so, but only if the people would change their ways and respect the laws and each other. He then walked out to the sea, raised his spear and ordered the water to <b>stop</b> <b>rising.</b>|$|E
50|$|This {{means that}} {{unstable}} air is now stable {{when it reaches}} the equilibrium level and convection stops. This level is often near the tropopause and can be indicated as near where the anvil of a thunderstorm because it is where the thunderstorm updraft is finally cut off, except {{in the case of}} overshooting tops where it continues rising to the maximum parcel level (MPL) due to momentum. More precisely, the cumulonimbus will <b>stop</b> <b>rising</b> around a few kilometres prior to reaching the level of neutral buoyancy and on average anvil glaciation occurs at a higher altitude over land than over sea (despite little difference in LNB from land to sea).|$|E

3000|$|... u, we also {{consider}} the duration of PRE as a parameter affecting the latitudinal extension of plasma bubble. Krall et al. (2010) have numerically investigated why plasma bubble <b>stops</b> <b>rising</b> and concluded that plasma bubble <b>stops</b> <b>rising</b> when eastward E at the upper edge of the bubble is equal to zero. This result suggests that the duration of PRE at plasma bubble generation could affect the latitudinal extension of plasma bubble. We define the duration of PRE as a period {{from the start of}} positive dh’F/dt until the time of the peak h’F. To reduce the uncertainty of h’F, we exclude h’F lower than an altitude of 300  km. In Fig.  2, shown as an example, dh’F/dt starts increasing at 17 : 10 LT. However, h’F between 17 : 10 and 18 : 00 LT does not exceed an altitude of 300  km. For this case, start of V [...]...|$|R
5000|$|To clear blocks, {{the player}} must align them in rows or columns {{of three or}} more identically colored blocks (for example, three red blocks in a {{contiguous}} horizontal row). The blocks then disappear from the playfield, and any blocks above them fall into the cleared space. Clearing more than three blocks in a single move scores a [...] "combo", worth extra points. If a clear causes other blocks to fall and cause additional clears, the player scores a [...] "chain", also worth extra points. With skill and planning, the player can cause multiple contiguous clears to occur one after another, scoring a higher chain count and progressively larger bonuses. The player is free to continue moving blocks as others clear, which aids in maintaining an ongoing chain. Clearing blocks also causes the stack to <b>stop</b> <b>rising</b> temporarily, and scoring chains and combos causes the stack to remain stopped for a variable amount of time (determined {{by the size of}} the combo or chain).|$|E
50|$|Since the {{material}} may expand 4-5 times under a vacuum, the mixing container must {{be large enough}} to hold a volume of four to five times the amount of the original material that is being vacuumed to allow for the expansion; if not, it will spill {{over the top of the}} container requiring clean-up that can be avoided. The material container is then placed into the vacuum chamber; a vacuum pump is connected and turned on. Once the vacuum reaches 29 inches (at sea level) of mercury, {{the material}} will begin to rise (resembling foam). When the material falls, it will plateau and <b>stop</b> <b>rising.</b> The vacuuming is continued for another 2 to 3 minutes to make certain all of the air has been removed from the material. Once this interval is reached, the vacuum pump is shut off and the vacuum chamber release valve is opened to equalize air pressure. The vacuum chamber is opened, the material is removed and is ready to pour into the mold.|$|E
5000|$|The foam used in {{buoyancy}} aids does degrade with age. Manufacturers add additional foam {{to ensure}} that their buoyancy aids will still provide enough force even after years of use. A rough life expectancy is three years of use, although buoyancy aids exposed to polluted water may degrade faster than normally expected.In practice Buoyancy aids far exceed a 3-year service life expectancy. they can be tested for buoyancy using a weight (for adult sizes this is about 5.5 kg)The test is simple, attach weight, squeeze out air, drop in water and force it under until bubbles <b>stop</b> <b>rising,</b> then let it go. and if the BA/PFD surfaces it's OK, many websites publish guidance on this as the actual weight required is different in some situations.

5000|$|A {{relief valve}} or {{pressure}} relief valve (PRV) {{is a type of}} safety valve used to control or limit the pressure in a system; pressure might otherwise build up and create a process upset, instrument or equipment failure, or fire. The pressure is relieved by allowing the pressurised fluid to flow from an auxiliary passage out of the system. The relief valve is designed or set to open at a predetermined set pressure to protect pressure vessels and other equipment from being subjected to pressures that exceed their design limits. When the set pressure is exceeded, the relief valve becomes the [...] "path of least resistance" [...] as the valve is forced open and a portion of the fluid is diverted through the auxiliary route. The diverted fluid (liquid, gas or liquid-gas mixture) is usually routed through a piping system known as a flare header or relief header to a central, elevated gas flare where it is usually burned and the resulting combustion gases are released to the atmosphere. As the fluid is diverted, the pressure inside the vessel will <b>stop</b> <b>rising.</b> Once it reaches the valve's reseating pressure, the valve will close. The blowdown is usually stated as a percentage of set pressure and refers to how much the pressure needs to drop before the valve reseats. The blowdown can vary from roughly 2-20%, and some valves have adjustable blowdowns.|$|E

40|$|Triggering vacuum {{breakdown}} at {{the upcoming}} laser facilities can provide rapid electron-positron pair production for studies in laboratory astrophysics and fundamental physics. However, {{the density of}} the emerging plasma should seemingly <b>stop</b> <b>rising</b> at the relativistic critical density, when the plasma becomes opaque. Here we identify the opportunity of breaking this limit using optimal beam configuration of petawatt-class lasers. Tightly focused laser fields allow plasma generation in a small focal volume much less than λ^ 3, and creating extreme plasma states in terms of density and produced currents. These states can be regarded as a new object of nonlinear plasma physics. Using 3 D QED-PIC simulations we demonstrate the possibility of reaching densities of more than 10 ^ 25 cm^- 3, which is an order of magnitude higher than previously expected. Controlling the process via the initial target parameters gives the opportunity to reach the discovered plasma states at the upcoming laser facilities...|$|E
40|$|Today society faces {{important}} decisions regarding climate change mitigation.

A scientific consensus is emerging that this buildup will affect the global climate, most likely stimulating warming.
