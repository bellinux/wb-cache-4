25|$|Watering: Different {{species of}} tree have roots with {{different}} tolerances for soil moisture. Some species tolerate continual wetness, {{while others are}} prone to rotting if the soil remains wet for long periods. A standard bonsai practice is to grow trees in a <b>soil</b> <b>mixture</b> that drains rapidly, so that roots {{are not allowed to}} be wet for long. To compensate for the relatively low water retention of the bonsai soil, water is applied frequently. The tree absorbs sufficient moisture for its needs while the water is passing through the soil, then the soil dries enough to reduce the chance of rotting. It is the grower's responsibility to ensure that watering occurs frequently enough to satisfy the bonsai with high watering requirements, while not waterlogging trees that use little water or have roots prone to rotting.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{includes}} two broad sections: experimental work and modelling. The {{core of the}} experimental work is the oil imbibition experiment in two unsaturated mixtures of silica sand and kaolinite clay (80 %/ 20 % and 60 %/ 40 % by weight). To investigate the effect of capillary forces on multiphase flow, three series of oil imbibition tests were performed with each type of soil: (1) Maximum capillary forces system, in which the <b>soil</b> <b>mixtures</b> were moulded with distilled water. (2) Intermediate capillary forces system, in which the <b>soil</b> <b>mixtures</b> were moulded with a 3 % aqueous surfactant solution. (3) Minimum capillary forces system, in which the <b>soil</b> <b>mixtures</b> were moulded with a 6 % aqueous surfactant solution. The durations of the oil imbibition experiments were 1, 2 and 3 days for the 80 / 20 mixture, and 3, 5 and 10 days for the 60 / 40 soil, {{for a total of}} 18 tests (9 per soil types). At the end of each experiment, the <b>soil</b> <b>mixtures</b> were sectioned to determine the water and oil contents of a predetermined number of samples. Additional laboratory work was carried out to characterize the <b>soil</b> <b>mixtures,</b> moulding liquids and motor oil used in this study. The modelling of oil migration in an unsaturated soil was carried out with the one dimensional form of the classical diffusion equation. Using the oil concentration profile curves and the Boltzmann transform technique, the oil diffusivities, D, were computed. The commercial program Tablecurve was then employed to determine the diffusivity function end parameters that best fit the computed D-$ theta$ relationship. The diffusivity function was then substituted in the finite difference form of the above-mentioned flow equation. By comparing the simulated results with the experimentally derived curves, the model was calibrated prior to predicting the time required to saturate the <b>soil</b> <b>mixtures...</b>|$|R
