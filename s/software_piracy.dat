40|$|Abstract [...] - Due to {{the rapid}} growth of Internet users in the last decades and illegal use of <b>software</b> from <b>piracies</b> without {{granting}} authorities from legal vendors, besides expensive of software products and draw backs in distribution, this paper offers a suitable technique to protect <b>software</b> from <b>piracy.</b> It relies on elliptic curve cryptography technique achieved via processor ID of the buyer or user. The bought software after downloading will be protected from illegal distribution through mechanism of elliptic curve with ElGamal cryptographic technique. In order to protect server from piracies and latencies causes from network communication, this paper offers software downloading during virtual computer or VMware. Time consuming for encryption and decryption will be shown. This paper concludes that using Elliptic curve offers equal security for small bit size, thereby reducing processing overhead.

Specifically, we hypothesize that attitudes toward the behavior, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, moral obligation and perceived prosecution risk influence intentions to engage in <b>software</b> and music <b>piracy.</b> Data were obtained from 237 university accounting students in a Caribbean university to assess the influence of the components of the theories and other modified and extended models. Findings reveal that attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, moral obligation and perceived prosecution risk significantly influence intentions to engage in <b>software</b> and music <b>piracy.</b> These findings lend full support to the hypothesized relationships in our extended theory of planned behavior...|$|R

40|$|The <b>piracy</b> of <b>software</b> {{has long}} been a concern for owners and {{developers}} of software. In order to prevent <b>software</b> from <b>piracy</b> and unauthorized modification, many techniques to protect software have been developed. Software watermarking is such a technique for protecting software by embedding secret information into the software to identify its copyright owner. As a relatively new scientific area, the key concepts in software watermarking are informal; some are even confusing. There is a need to formalize these fundamental terms to facilitate the research in this field. In this paper, we formally define some concepts for software watermark recognition and use them to develop some software watermarking recognition algorithms for the QP software watermarking algorithm. We also design a prototype model of software watermark embedding and recognition system based on the concepts and algorithms established in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Getting {{a handle}} on what drives a {{consumer}} to choose a fake, illegal product is a complex job.

And, consumers include weak government commitment to fighting and prosecuting counterfeiting among their motives – or excuses – to look the other way. In this research {{the focus is on the}} demand side of the marketplace, i. e. the consumer. The researcher wishes to investigate about consumers’ ethics towards piracy and examine factors that motivate them to purchase pirated DVDs and CDs. In the previous study made by Shoham (2008) the factors that may influence consumers’ willingness to engage in <b>software</b> and CD <b>piracy</b> were analyzed, they are relativism perception, moral/ethics and attitudes to piracy.

Tomato received encouragement from a Square Enix employee who anticipated the translation. At the end of the project, the team felt that the fan translation would lead to more protection against fan translations rather than more encouragement, so as to maximize the underserved audience. Tomato said that he was unable to appreciate his work since it was so familiar to him, with every original and translated line memorized. He expected that would change in five years. The project left Tomato with a greater respect for the craft of writing.|$|E

40|$|Software-splitting is a {{technique}} for protecting <b>software</b> from <b>piracy</b> by removing code fragments from an application and placing them on a remote trusted server. The server provides the missing functionality but never the missing code. As long as the missing functionality is hard to reverse-engineer, the application cannot run without validating itself to the server. Current software-splitting techniques scale poorly to the Internet because interactions with the remote server are synchronous: the application must frequently block {{waiting for a response}} from the server. Perceptible delays due to network latency are unacceptable for many kinds of highlyreactive applications, such as games or graphics applications. This paper introduces virtual leashing, the first nonblocking software-splitting technique. Virtual leashing ensures that the application and the server communicate asynchronously, so the application’s performance is independent (within reason) of large or variable network latencies. Experiments show that virtual leashing makes only modest demands on communication bandwidth, space, and computation. ...|$|R

In a recent paper by Myles and Collberg [3], the QP algorithm was corrected, and was, for the first time, implemented to watermark software through register allocation. It is called the QPS algorithm. Our paper discusses some difficulties with the published descriptions of the QP and QPS algorithms, points out the problem in the extractability of the watermarks inserted by the QP algorithm through examples, proves the correctness of a clarified version of the QPS algorithm, and proposes an improvement for the QP algorithm.
