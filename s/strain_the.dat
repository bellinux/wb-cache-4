5|$|People with prolonged, frequent, {{or close}} contact with people with TB are at {{particularly}} high risk of becoming infected, with an estimated 22% infection rate.

Transmission should occur from only people with active TB – those with latent infection are not thought to be contagious.

The cascade of person-to-person spread can be circumvented by segregating those with active ("overt") TB and putting them on anti-TB drug regimens.

If someone does become infected, it typically takes three to four weeks before the newly infected person becomes infectious enough to transmit the disease to others.|$|E

This material is both strong and ductile so that vehicle structures can maintain their current safety levels while using less material.

Transformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP) steel involves special alloying and heat treatments to stabilize amounts of austenite at room temperature in normally austenite-free low-alloy ferritic steels. By applying <b>strain,</b> <b>the</b> austenite undergoes a phase transition to martensite without the addition of heat.
