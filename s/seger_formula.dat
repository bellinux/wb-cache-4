The base <b>Seger</b> <b>formula</b> used was 0. 3 KNaO, 0. 3 CaO, 0. 4 ZnO or BaO; xAl 2 O 3 and ySiO 2 . Different Al 2 O 3 /SiO 2 formula ratios for glossy and matt glazes were tested with raw materials from Cameroon and Tanzania. In the Cameroonian glazes, a local pegmatite (quartz, microcline, albite) with low coloured oxides replaced an albitic feldspar in the Tanzanian glazes. The other materials were kaolin, limestone, silica and barium carbonate or zinc oxide. The glazes were tested at Seger Cone 7 (1240 ℃) on stoneware slabs (made up of the same feldspathic glaze material: 18 %, silica sand or quartz 27 %, ball clay 40 % and kaolin 15 %) from both Tanzania and Cameroon materials. From results obtained, zinc oxide acted as a more vigorous flux than barium carbonate at cone 7, which is obvious in the glazes with pegmatite (with high quartz content). At a <b>Seger</b> <b>formula</b> of Al 2 O 3 /SiO 2 1 : 10, transparent glazes were obtained. In these glazes the alumina content was lower and when increased to higher Seger ratios 1 : 4. 7 - 8. 7, the gloss was lowered to matt-luster due to fine crystal formation...|$|E
40|$|M. Tech. (Ceramics) The {{research}} project attempts {{to fill a}} void by assembling data dealing with a comprehensive range of South African clay and glaze materials, suited {{to the needs of}} the studio potter, and recording test results. South African kaolins, ball clays, fireclays, miscellaneous clays, grogs, bentonites, felspathic materials, alkaline earths, silica, refractory materials (other than clays) and mineral pigments are dealt with. A limited selection of foreign materials, frequently referred to in studio-potter publications, was also used in comparative tests. The materials are recorded with reference to the ultimate analysis, <b>seger</b> <b>formula,</b> proximate analysis (where applicable), properties and results of trials using the materials in clay bodies and/or glazes. It was demonstrated that South African materials are largely of good quality e. g. kaolin, felspars and silica. Variability of clay supplies because of lack of stockpiling and blending practices, especially by small suppliers, is often a problem. When the composition of glaze materials and trials indicated that imported equivalents were superior because of variability of local supplies or poor grade material, then substitutes were tested using South African materials. Basic clay bodies and glazes covering a wide temperature range from Egyptian Paste, low-fired wares such as raku, terracotta-and-white-earthenwares, stoneware and soft-porcelain bodies and glazes are dealt with giving a brief outline of the requirements for each type. Suggestions of suitable South African materials for their composition are made. Trials and results are recorded. The knowledge gained of South African materials available and a study of the materials enables the studio potter to utilize local materials with awareness and confidenc...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} investigates 2 ̆ 2 middle fire 2 ̆ 2 ceramic glazes in {{the firing}} temperatures between 1100 and 1200 degrees centigrade (Seger cones 1 to 6). It addresses {{an area of}} firing temperatures that has been largely neglected over the centuries, in contrast to both earthenware and stoneware about {{which there is a}} vast amount of information available. The research shows, however, that there is evidence of a current growth of interest worldwide in midfiring for reasons of economy and ecology. The author 2 ̆ 7 s long invovement in pottery extending over forty years positions him well to develop glazes in this study which compare favourably with those in other temperature ranges. Of added significance and originality the middle fire glazes have been developed for 2 ̆ 2 once firing 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 raw glazing 2 ̆ 2 where glaze is applied to the damp pot thereby eliminating the biscuit fire. Researching the literature of ceramic studio work done both in Australia and overseas has yielded no reference to this method of glaze application at the middle fire temperatures. The combination of middle firing and raw glaze application is worthy of consideration because each part of the process saves on fuel consumption. There isa saving in costs for the potter and there are benefits to the ecology with less fossil fuels used, less greenhouse gasses created and less contribution to the possible global warming. The dissertation is of necessity a technical paper put into perspective by a brief examination of the history of glazes, as seen from the viewpoint of a potter as opposed to the traditional archaeological viewpoint. Early pottery from the Middle East, China, Japan, Korea and Europe are considered. The links between these Asian and European traditions and Australian ceramics, introduced by Bernard Leach with the publication of his APotter 2 ̆ 7 s Book, are described as the basis of Australian glaze traditions. Recipes for raw glazes firing at Seger cones 1 to 6 are listed together with descriptions of the fired results and <b>Seger</b> <b>formula</b> calculations...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} an {{extended}} literature survey on ceramics and porcelains in particular, has been documented. Samples from two Ugandan deposits of each feldspar and quartz were characterised {{by means of}} X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis, chemical analysis and scanning electron microscopy and found to possess requisite properties for making electro porcelain insulators. Five porcelain bodies were formulated and samples were fabricated from materials collected from selected deposits in Uganda using different mixing proportions of clay, feldspar and quartz. The properties of the formulated bodies were studied in relation to workability, firing temperature, dielectric and bending strengths. The strengths (both mechanical and dielectric) were found to decrease as the firing temperature was increased above 1250 °C. Additionally, ten formulations with components {{in the range of}} 30 - 60 % clay, 20 - 45 % feldspar and 20 - 25 % sand were prepared. Specimens for mechanical and physical characterisation were made using the plastic extrusion method. The samples were characterised in terms of constituent oxide composition, flexural strength, fracture toughness, dielectric strength along with microstructural and phase properties using ICP-AES analyses, 4 -point load bending strength test, Vicker’s indentation method, SEM and XRD analyses respectively. XRD studies revealed that the crystalline phases formed were mullite and quartz and their intensity was almost identical for all samples fired at 1250 °C but there was a decrease inquartz content as temperature was increased above 1250 °C. Samples with 20 % sandcontent resulted in higher density, MOR and fracture toughness compared to thosecontaining 25 % sand. Mullite content on the other hand did not change at temperatures above 1200 °C but there were significant differences in the morphologies of the mullite crystals in the samples. Optimum mechanical and electrical properties were found at maximum vitrification and a microstructure showing small closely packed mullite needles. This occurred at a firing temperature of 1250 °C. Three promising porcelain formulations from the above investigations were chosen and five glazes formulated to fit on biscuit fired specimens. The best-fitting glaze was adopted. The formulated specimens were investigated using dilatometry, Steger test, FEG-SEM, XRD, 4 -point bending, dielectric strength and fracture toughness tests. A porcelain specimen consisting of 68 % SiO 2, 19 % Al 2 O 3, 4. 7 % K 2 O and a glaze of <b>Seger</b> <b>formula</b> RO: 0. 57 Al 2 O 3 : 4. 86 SiO 2 exhibited MOR of 105 MPa with Weibull modulus of 5. 6 and a dielectric strength of 18 kV/mm upon firing at a heating rate of 6 ºC/min to 1250 ºC, soaking for 2 h at the top temperature and cooling down to 500 °C at a rate of 6 °C/min, followed by furnace cooling. The microstructure of the high strength specimen exhibited round mullite needles, quartz and glass. Holding samples for 2 h at peak temperature resulted in a 22 % increase in MOR compared to 1 h holding. Glazing further improved strength by 67 % for the best sample. Compressive stresses in glaze contributed to the strengthening effect. The dielectric and mechanical strengths obtained make the ormulated sample suitable for application in low voltage electrical insulation. QC 2010060...|$|E
