40|$|Abstract. In {{accordance}} to the drawback of amphibious vehicle's {{low speed}} in water, {{a new kind}} of folding mechanism based on double wishbone suspension is proposed. Referring to the working conditions of the <b>wheel</b> <b>lifted</b> mechanism, the hydraulic circuit, which provides with the functions of pressure limiting, locked and pressure retaining, is designed to ensure the accuracy of <b>wheel</b> <b>lifted</b> and the driving safety. The appropriate hydraulic cylinders, hydraulic components and auxiliary components are chosen due to the hydraulic system load and the maximum flow rate...|$|R
50|$|The GT Junior has a tight {{suspension}} and weighed in at just 2050 lb for the 1.3 variant. Because of this, the car would often go onto three <b>wheels,</b> <b>lifting</b> the inside front wheel {{off the road}} when driven enthusiastically.|$|R

50|$|Excessive roll stiffness, {{typically}} {{achieved by}} configuring an anti-roll bar too aggressively, {{can make the}} inside <b>wheels</b> <b>lift</b> off the ground during hard cornering. This {{can be used to}} advantage: many front wheel drive production cars <b>lift</b> a rear <b>wheel</b> when cornering hard in order to overload the opposite wheel, limiting understeer.|$|R

Firstly, the carriage is raised via an internal hydraulic jack located under the cradle of the gun. Once the gun is at the required height, the wheels are raised via the <b>wheel</b> <b>lifting</b> lever; this allows the two split stabilizer legs {{to be separated from}} the mono stabiliser leg and brought rearward into firing configuration.|$|R

The selenium cell exposure meter is now coupled to a [...] "setting wheel" [...] located on {{the very bottom of}} the lens mount. This <b>setting</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>sets</b> adjusts the camera's exposure value (EV) by changing (in a most complex fashion) the aperture and/or shutter rings {{at the same time that}} it changes the depth-of-field pointers on the camera's lens. When another button (located on the top plate) is pushed simultaneously, the <b>setting</b> <b>wheel</b> is also used to set the exposure meter's ASA/DIN setting.|$|R

50|$|Under most {{conditions}} {{the car is}} very responsive and forgiving, but it has some handling issues. The chassis, which is shared by the TR2, TR3, TR3A and TR4 has limited wheel travel. As a result, on very hard cornering, the inside rear <b>wheel</b> can <b>lift,</b> causing sudden over-steer due to the increased load on the outside rear tyre. This is particularly true with radial tyres; the original TR2/3/3A suspension was built with older, crossply tyre designs in mind. The <b>wheel</b> <b>lifting</b> is more sudden than that of other cars, because it is caused by coming {{to the end of}} the suspension travel while there is still load on the tyre, so the load on the other (outside) rear wheel is a discontinuous function of cornering load, rather than just changing slope.|$|R

50|$|The Bat {{begins with}} a turn {{out of the station}} and up a pinch <b>wheel</b> <b>lift,</b> into a series of helixes and small hills around the bat cave and other themed {{features}} and trees. The Bat comes to an end with as the train is slowed by magnetic brakes and returns to the station. The minimum height for riders of the Bat is 42 in with an adult companion, or 50 in to ride alone; a smaller minimum height restriction than most of the other roller coasters located in the park.|$|R
50|$|The ride has one train, {{which has}} 10 cars with 2 seats on each car {{catering}} 650 riders per hour. The safety system consists of over-the-shoulder restraints that lock {{into place and}} then a belt-type connector that attaches the seat base to the over-the-shoulder restraints. Riders are taken up 14.8 m by a <b>wheeled</b> <b>lift</b> hill, and go through a tight helix, followed {{by a series of}} small turns and drops. Upon approaching the station, the ride is slowed by a magnetic brake run. Each ride cycle takes 1.5 minutes.|$|R

Magee soon crashes out of the race, which gets red-flagged because an ambulance needs to get on the track, Magee suffering severe head injuries and ending his season. He recovers, but never races at the same level.|$|R

The train then dips diagonally under the lift hill before elevating and approaching {{the back end of}} the station and passing over top. The train then runs back parallel with the lift hill before entering two separate helices and entering the brake run. The train then returns to the station where riders dismount and exit back into the Kids' WB Fun Zone.|$|R
