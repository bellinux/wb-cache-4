50|$|In 2010, Musco was {{presented}} with one of its largest projects to date, lighting the East Span of the San Francisco Bay Bridge. After three years of development and testing, Musco had a design that met the performance and aesthetic requirements for the bridge. This design featured more than 51,500 LEDs in 1,600 light fixtures; all strategically aimed to highlight the bridge without shining light {{in the eyes of}} the 300,000 daily drivers. The new LED system reduced energy consumption by 50 percent when compared to typical metal halide lighting. <b>Since</b> <b>lighting</b> the White House in 2008, Musco has installed its LED systems into some of the world's largest sports complexes and facilities. In 2013, Musco installed LED lights at Arizona State University's Wells Fargo Arena, making them the first in all of NCAA basketball. The following year, LakePoint Sporting Community placed its fields under Musco's Light-Structure Green™ LED system, allowing them to be the first major sports complex in the world to do so. Musco also installed its system at NRG Stadium, making it one of the first NFL stadiums to be lit with LED technology, and at Twickenham Stadium, one of the first in Europe, for the Rugby World Cup being held in England. Additionally, Musco's SportsCluster Green™ LED system can be seen at work in the Dallas Cowboys’ AT&T Stadium. In 2015, Musco took on the unique and challenging task of providing LED lighting for both the Statue of Liberty and Mount Rushmore, two of the United States’ iconic landmarks. Musco's latest projects of scale include Emirates Stadium, home of Arsenal FC, Petco Park of the San Diego Padres, and Minute Maid Park, home of the Houston Astros. Musco currently has offices located all around the globe, including Australia, Canada, China, Cyprus, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Jordan, South Africa, South Korea, UAE, United Kingdom, and the United States.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Demand {{response}} programs seek to ad-just {{the normal}} consumption patterns of electric power consumers {{in response to}} incentive payments that are offered by utility companies to induce lower consumption at peak hours or when the power sys-tem reliability is at risk. While prior studies have extensively studied the capacity of offering demand response in buildings by controlling the load at air conditioners, water heaters, and various home appli-ances, they lack to offer methods to also utilize the full demand response capacity of automatic lighting control systems. <b>Since</b> <b>lighting</b> systems consume {{a large amount of}} the total energy used in buildings, addressing this shortcoming is an important research problem. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to take a systematic optimization-based approach to assess demand response capacity of automatic lighting con-trol systems in commercial and office buildings...|$|E

30|$|An {{important}} {{question that arises is}} whether model-based metrics are superior over image-based solutions. Although {{there are several}} studies on this issue, {{it is not possible to}} clearly state that one group of metrics is superior to the other. Rogowitz et al. conclude that image quality metrics are not adequate for measuring the quality of 3 D meshes <b>since</b> <b>lighting</b> and animation affect the results significantly [40]. On the other hand, Cleju and Saupe claim that image-based metrics predict perceptual quality better than metrics working on 3 D geometry, and discuss ways to improve the geometric distances [10]. A recent study [27] investigates the best set of parameters for the image-based metrics when evaluating the quality of 3 D models and compares them to several model-based methods. The implications from this study show that image-based metrics perform well for simple use cases such as determining the best parameters of a compression algorithm or in the cases when model-based metrics are not applicable.|$|E
40|$|International audienceNoisy {{volumetric}} details like clouds, grounds, plaster, bark, roughcast, etc. {{are frequently}} encountered {{in nature and}} bring {{an important contribution to}} the realism of outdoor scenes. We introduce a new interactive approach, easing the creation of procedural representations of “stochastic” volumetric details by using a single example photograph. Instead of attempting to reconstruct an accurate geometric representation from the photograph, we use a stochastic multi-scale approach that fits parameters of a multi-layered noise-based 3 D deformation model, using a multi-resolution filter banks error metric. Once computed, visually similar details can be applied to arbitrary objects {{with a high degree of}} visual realism, <b>since</b> <b>lighting</b> and parallax effects are naturally taken into account. Our approach is inspired by image-based techniques. In practice, the user supplies a photograph of an object covered by noisy details, provides a corresponding coarse approximation of the shape of this object as well as an estimated lighting condition (generally a light source direction). Our system then determines the corresponding noise-based representation as well as some diffuse, ambient, specular and semi-transparency reflectance parameters. The resulting details are fully procedural and, as such, have the advantage of extreme compactness, while they can be infinitely extended without repetition in order to cover huge surfaces...|$|E
40|$|When {{immersed}} in a 3 -dimensional virtual world story, viewers may become distracted because the virtual world affords them freedom to navigate and look around. This also means that the story plot is open to different interpretations. This {{raises the question of}} how to best guide viewer experience in virtual world story scenarios. To address this issue, our methodology has been to study the use of lighting in cinema and theater to direct attention and explore how these techniques can be adapted to virtual world scenarios. Some of the techniques studied and analyzed include the use of light contrast, colored lights, moving lights, staged lighting, fading lights, pulsing lights and follow spotlights. <b>Since</b> <b>lighting</b> serves a similar purpose in both theater and cinema, we discuss and propose with examples how these lighting techniques may be used to direct attention in virtual reality storytelling. The focus in this thesis is on translating principles of cinematic and theatrical lighting into virtual world narratives. From this exploration, we developed applicable approaches and created illustrative examples. A detailed discussion is documented on the process, production and implementation of cinematic and theatrical lighting approaches into VR. From this we gained insights into the effective use of lighting to guide viewer attention. For each lighting technique, the most important function is its ability to selectively direct viewer attention while supporting the narrative. A set of guidelines on how to effectively direct viewer attention using lighting in virtual world scenarios is presented. The purpose of these guidelines is to aid storytellers in creating lighting to direct viewer attention in virtual world story scenarios. This is achieved by providing information on what to consider when evaluating the story needs, developing the lighting design and its implementation...|$|E
