40|$|Background Large {{carnivores}} influence {{ecosystem functions}} at various scales. Thus, their local extinction {{is not only}} a species-specific conservation concern, but also reflects on the overall habitat quality and ecosystem value. Species-habitat relationships at fine scale reflect the individuals’ ability to procure resources and negotiate intraspecific competition. Such fine scale habitat choices are more pronounced in large carnivores such as tiger (Panthera tigris), which exhibits competitive exclusion in habitat and mate selection strategies. Although landscape level policies and conservation strategies are increasingly promoted for tiger conservation, specific management interventions require knowledge of the habitat correlates at fine scale. Methods We studied nine radio-collared individuals of a successfully reintroduced tiger population in Panna Tiger Reserve, central India, focussing on the species-habitat relationship at fine scales. With 16 eco-geographical variables, we performed Manly’s selection ratio and K-select analyses to define population-level and individual-level variation in resource selection, respectively. We analysed the data obtained during the exploratory period of six tigers and during the <b>settled</b> <b>period</b> of eight tigers separately, and compared the consequent results. We further used the <b>settled</b> <b>period</b> characteristics to model and map habitat suitability based on the Mahalanobis D 2 method and the Boyce index. Results There was a clear difference in habitat selection by tigers between the exploratory and the <b>settled</b> <b>period.</b> During the exploratory period, tigers selected dense canopy and bamboo forests, but also spent time near villages and relocated village sites. However, settled tigers predominantly selected bamboo forests in complex terrain, riverine forests and teak-mixed forest, and totally avoided human settlements and agriculture areas. There were individual variations in habitat selection between exploratory and <b>settled</b> <b>periods.</b> Based on threshold limits of habitat selection by the Boyce Index, we established that 83 % of core and 47 % of buffer areas are now suitable habitats for tiger in this reserve. Discussion Tiger management often focuses on large-scale measures, but this study for the first time highlights the behaviour and fine-scale individual-specific habitat selection strategies. Such knowledge is vital for management of critical tiger habitats and specifically for the success of reintroduction programs. Our spatially explicit habitat suitability map provides a baseline for conservation planning and optimizing carrying capacity of the tiger population in this reserve...|$|R

The probability of collecting foraging data from an individual’s first trial fell below 50 % {{if it had been}} in captivity for more than 12 days prior to that trial, whereas the probability was> 75 % if trials were completed within two days of capture. The successful collection of foraging data from subsequent trials was also dependent on the number of days an individual spent in captivity prior to its first trial and on whether that individual foraged in its first trial, suggesting that some individuals were more inclined to forage in captivity. Individuals that foraged in their first trial had a 94 % higher success rate in subsequent trials than those that did not.

40|$|Large {{tube filling}} bubbles rising up through {{quiescent}} fluid in a vertical tube are {{commonly known as}} Taylor bubbles. Their apparent simplicity of form and behaviour has led to them being viewed and modelled as a paradigm for both large bubble dynamics, where there is no continuous gas flow, and slug flow for the case of continuous gas flow. Central to this approach is the question: what diameter tubes support stable Taylor bubbles? In this paper we examine the case of low viscosity Taylor bubbles through experiments and theory and show that they exist in much wider diameter tubes than had previously been reported. In order for the bubbles to be stable a <b>settling</b> <b>period</b> is required to allow the column to sufficiently quiesce. This <b>settling</b> <b>period</b> is compared favourably with the classical stability analysis of Batchelor (1987).

40|$|We {{reported}} previously {{that for}} Cyg X- 1 {{there is a}} <b>settling</b> <b>period</b> following the transition from hard to soft state (astro-ph/ 9610071). During the transiton, The low energy spectrum (below ~ 10 keV) varies significantly from observation to observation while the high energy portion changes little. The source reaches nominal soft-state brightness during the <b>settling</b> <b>period.</b> It can be characterized by a soft low-energy spectrum and significant low-frequency 1 /f noise and white noise on the power density spectrum (PDS). The low-energy spectrum becomes even softer, and the PDS is completely dominated by the 1 /f noise, when the ``true'' soft state is reached. In this paper, subsequent RXTE observations of Cyg X- 1 in the soft state are examined, and the results confirm our earlier conclusions. Furthermore, we show the results from observations taken during a soft-to-hard transition. As expected, the white noise appears again, and accordingly, the 1 /f noise becomes less dominant, similar to the <b>settling</b> <b>period</b> {{at the end of}} the hard-to-soft transition. The low-frequency 1 /f noise has not been observed when Cyg X- 1 is in the hard state. Therefore, it seems to be positively correlated with the disk mass accretion rate which is low in the hard state and high in the soft state. The difference in the observed spectral and timing properties between the hard and soft states is qualitatively consistent with a simple ``fluctuating corona'' model (astro-ph/ 9610071).
