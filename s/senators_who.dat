5|$|The Student Senate is the {{legislative}} branch, and {{is composed of}} 80 <b>senators</b> <b>who</b> serve one-year terms.

5|$|The <b>senators</b> <b>who</b> protested were {{threatened}} by the Russians (represented by Ambassador Otto von Stackelberg), who declared that {{in the face of}} refusal the whole capital of Warsaw would be destroyed. Other threats included executions, confiscation of estates, and increase of territory subjected to partition. Some senators were arrested and exiled to Siberia.|$|E

5|$|His mother {{publicly}} {{declared that}} he was the illegitimate son of Caracalla, and therefore deserving the loyalty of Roman soldiers and <b>senators</b> <b>who</b> had sworn allegiance to Caracalla. After Julia Maesa displayed her wealth to the Third Legion at Raphana they swore allegiance to Elagabalus. At sunrise on 16 May 218, Publius Valerius Comazon, commander of the legion, declared him emperor. To strengthen his legitimacy Elagabalus assumed Caracalla's names, Marcus Aurelius Antoninus.|$|E
5|$|The {{change of}} {{government}} was welcome {{particularly to the}} <b>senators,</b> <b>who</b> had been harshly persecuted during Domitian's reign. As an immediate gesture of goodwill towards his supporters, Nerva publicly swore that no senators would {{be put to death}} as long as he remained in office. He called an end to trials based on treason, released those who had been imprisoned under these charges, and granted amnesty to many who had been exiled.|$|E
5|$|The {{group was}} formed by 15 non-affiliated Senators in September 2017, with Elaine McCoy being elected as the group's {{facilitator}} for a term ending June 2017 (by January 2017, 35 Senators {{were members of the}} ISG). In December 2016, the Senate passed a motion to fund the Independent Senators Group for the next two fiscal years.

5|$|The {{presiding}} consul began each {{meeting with}} a speech on an issue, and then referred the issue to the <b>senators,</b> <b>who</b> discussed the matter by order of seniority. Unimportant matters could be voted on by a voice vote or by a show of hands, while important votes resulted in a physical division of the house, with senators voting by taking a place {{on either side of}} the chamber. Any vote was always between a proposal and its negative.|$|E
5|$|Caesar {{was assassinated}} on March 15, 44 BC. The {{assassination}} {{was led by}} Gaius Cassius and Marcus Brutus. Most of the conspirators were <b>senators,</b> <b>who</b> had a variety of economic, political, or personal motivations for carrying out the assassination. Many were afraid that Caesar would soon resurrect the monarchy and declare himself king. Others feared loss of property or prestige as Caesar carried out his land reforms {{in favor of the}} landless classes. Virtually all the conspirators fled the city after Caesar's death in fear of retaliation. The civil war that followed destroyed {{what was left of the}} Republic.|$|E
5|$|In {{the time}} of Nero, {{senators}} were still primarily from Rome {{and other parts of}} Italy, with some from the Iberian peninsula and southern France; men from the Greek-speaking provinces of the East began to be added under Vespasian. The first senator from the most eastern province, Cappadocia, was admitted under Marcus Aurelius. By {{the time of}} the Severan dynasty (193–235), Italians made up less than half the Senate. During the 3rd century, domicile at Rome became impractical, and inscriptions attest to <b>senators</b> <b>who</b> were active in politics and munificence in their homeland (patria).|$|E

5|$|Lame duck {{president}} John Quincy Adams nominated Crittenden to the U.S. Supreme Court on December 17, 1828 but <b>Senators</b> <b>who</b> supported president-elect Jackson {{voted to}} postpone confirmation until Jackson could nominate his own man. After his brief service as Kentucky Secretary of State, {{the state legislature}} elected Crittenden to the second of his four non-consecutive stints in the U.S. Senate. Upon his election as president, William Henry Harrison appointed Crittenden as Attorney General, but 5 months after Harrison's death, political differences prompted him to resign rather than continue his service under Harrison's successor, John Tyler.|$|E
5|$|On November 1, 1946, Vermont Governor Mortimer R. Proctor {{appointed}} Flanders to the U.S. Senate as a Republican {{to complete}} the term of Republican Senator Warren Austin. Austin had just been appointed by U.S. President Harry S. Truman as Ambassador to the United Nations. Flanders's appointment gave him seniority over the freshman <b>Senators</b> <b>who</b> would be elected four days later on November 5. Flanders ran for the office then, as well, and was elected to a full term. He was overwhelmingly reelected in 1952. He declined to seek a third term in 1958.|$|E
5|$|The Senate {{as a body}} {{remained}} {{devoid of}} any significant power; nevertheless, the <b>senators,</b> <b>who</b> had been marginalized as potential holders of imperial functions during the 3rd century, could now dispute such positions alongside more upstart bureaucrats. Some modern historians see in those administrative reforms an attempt by Constantine at reintegrating the senatorial order into the imperial administrative elite to counter the possibility of alienating pagan senators from a Christianized imperial rule; however, such an interpretation remains conjectural, {{given the fact that}} we do not have the precise numbers about pre-Constantine conversions to Christianity in the old senatorial milieu—some historians suggesting that early conversions among the old aristocracy were more numerous than previously supposed.|$|E

5|$|The {{student body}} is {{represented}} by the three-branch Student Government. The executive branch consists of seven executives who each have different areas of focus. The legislative branch consists of 23 student <b>senators</b> <b>who</b> represent each academic and residential district. The judicial branch consists of seven justices that deal with judicial matters when necessary. In addition, three standing committees enhance university life for all students: University Programming Council (UPC), Student Organization Funding Agency (SOFA), and Student Communications Funding Committee (SCFC). In addition, five administrative assistants help with all areas of Student Government.|$|E
5|$|When no {{help was}} {{forthcoming}} and {{the armies of}} the combined nations occupied Warsaw, the capital, to compel by force of arms the calling of the assembly, no alternative could be chosen save passive submission to their will. Those of the <b>senators</b> <b>who</b> advised against this step were threatened by the Russians, represented by the ambassador, Otto von Stackelberg, who declared that {{in the face of}} refusal the whole of Warsaw would be destroyed by them. Other threats included execution, confiscation of estates, and further increases of partitioned territory; according to Edward Henry Lewinski Corwin, some senators were even arrested by the Russians and exiled to Siberia.|$|E
5|$|When the entourage reached Rome in {{the autumn}} of 219, Comazon and other allies of Julia Maesa and Elagabalus were given {{powerful}} and lucrative positions, to the chagrin of many <b>senators</b> <b>who</b> did not consider them worthy of such privileges. After his tenure as Praetorian prefect, Comazon would serve as the city prefect of Rome three times, and as consul twice. Elagabalus soon devalued the Roman currency. He decreased the silver purity of the denarius from 58% to 46.5%— the actual silver weight dropping from 1.82grams to 1.41grams. He also demonetized the antoninianus during this period in Rome.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in the mid-3rd {{century the}} {{emperors}} began to favor {{members of the}} equestrian order over <b>senators,</b> <b>who</b> had had a monopoly {{on the most important}} offices of state. Senators were stripped of the command of legions and most provincial governorships (as it was felt that they lacked the specialized military upbringing needed in an age of acute defense needs), such posts being given to equestrians by Diocletian and his colleagues—following a practice enforced piecemeal by their predecessors. The emperors, however, still needed the talents and the help of the very rich, who were relied on to maintain social order and cohesion by means of a web of powerful influence and contacts at all levels. Exclusion of the old senatorial aristocracy threatened this arrangement.|$|E
5|$|Donen briefly {{returned}} to the musical genre in 1958 with Damn Yankees!, based on George Abbott's Broadway hit. He again co-directed with Abbott in the same hands-off collaboration as their first film. Like The Pajama Game the film includes music by Adler and Ross and choreography by Fosse. It starred Tab Hunter, Gwen Verdon, and Ray Walston. Damn Yankees! is an adaptation of the Faust legend about {{a fan of the}} baseball team the Washington <b>Senators</b> <b>who</b> mentions that he would sell his soul to give the losing team a good hitter. Walston plays the Brooks Brothers-attired Devil who grants the fan his wish and transforms him into the muscular young hitter Joe Hardy (Hunter). Donen was able to shoot three real Senator-Yankee games on location with as many as seven hidden cameras. The low-budget film was a moderate financial success and received good reviews. It was also Donen's last musical film for many years.|$|E
5|$|Germanicus {{had died}} in AD 19, in {{somewhat}} suspicious circumstances in Syria. Following his death, his wife Agrippina the Elder returned to Rome with their six children and became increasingly involved {{with a group of}} <b>senators</b> <b>who</b> opposed the growing power of Sejanus. Her relations with Tiberius became increasingly fraught, as she made it clear that she believed that he was {{responsible for the death of}} Germanicus. The climate was further poisoned by the hatred that Tiberius' mother Livia Drusilla (the widow of Augustus) felt for her, since Agrippina's ambition, to be the mother of emperors and thus Rome's first woman, was an open secret. To Sejanus, Agrippina's sons Nero Caesar, Drusus Caesar and Caligula were a threat to his power.|$|E
