Each 0. 5 mL dose contains the following: a minimum of 1350 PFU (plaque forming units) of Oka/Merck varicella virus when reconstituted and stored {{at room temperature for}} 30 minutes, approximately 25 mg of sucrose, 12. 5 mg hydrolyzed gelatin, 3. 2 mg sodium chloride, 0. 5 mg monosodium L-glutamate, 0. 45 mg of <b>sodium</b> <b>phosphate</b> <b>dibasic,</b> 0. 08 mg of potassium phosphate monobasic, 0. 08 mg of potassium chloride; residual components of MRC- 5 cells including DNA and protein; and trace quantities of sodium phosphate monobasic, EDTA, neomycin, and fetal bovine serum. The product contains no preservative. To maintain potency, the lyophilized vaccine must be kept frozen at an average temperature of...|$|E
30|$|In vitro 125 I-[Sar 1, Ile 8]Ang II binding {{was carried}} out using the method {{published}} previously [29]. Briefly, rats were sacrificed 2 – 3  days after PET imaging studies to allow direct comparisons. Following decapitation, dissected kidneys were quickly immersed in OCT compound (Tissue-Tek), frozen on dry ice, and stored at − 80  °C. The kidneys were sectioned in the axial axis into 20 -μm-thick slices at − 18  °C with a cryostat. Tissue sections were thaw-mounted on glass slides and stored at − 80  °C. On {{the day of the}} experiment, the slides were pre-washed in assay buffer (150  mM NaCl, 50  mM <b>sodium</b> <b>phosphate</b> <b>dibasic,</b> 1  mM EDTA, 0.1  mM Bacitracin, 0.1  % BSA) for 15  min then incubated with 0.8 nM 125 I-[Sar 1, Ile 8]Ang II (Perkin Elmer)for 90  min at room temperature in the presence of AT 2 R antagonist, PD 123, 319 (10  μM) to determine total (non-AT 2 R) binding or with unlabelled Ang II for non-specific binding. Specific binding of 125 I-[Sar 1, Ile 8]Ang II was calculated as total (non-AT 2 R) minus non-specific binding. After incubation, the slides were washed three times (4  °C) sequentially in buffer, deionized water, and buffer and then dried. Sections were exposed to phosphor imaging plates (Kodak Screen-K, Bio-Rad) for 48  h. Phosphor plates were read at a 100 -μm resolution (Bio-Rad Molecular Imager FX) and analyzed using Quantity One Software (Bio-Rad, Philadelphia). Quantification was done manually by tracing the whole kidney cortex for the radioactivity density (counts/mm 2).|$|E
50|$|Monosodium {{phosphate}} (MSP), {{also known}} as monobasic <b>sodium</b> <b>phosphate</b> and <b>sodium</b> dihydrogen <b>phosphate,</b> is an inorganic compound of <b>sodium</b> with dihydrogen <b>phosphate</b> (H2PO4−) anion. One of many <b>sodium</b> <b>phosphates,</b> {{it is a common}} industrial chemical. The salt exists in an anhydrous form, as well as mono- and dihydrates.|$|R

40|$|Bowel {{preparations}} containing <b>Sodium</b> <b>phosphate</b> – a {{risk for}} renal damage? - There are several well-documented cases of acute irreversible renal failure involving renal calcium phosphate deposits after {{the use of}} bowel preparations containing <b>sodium</b> <b>phosphate</b> (e. g., Colophos®). - Neither randomised clinical nor epidemiological studies have established an association between <b>sodium</b> <b>phosphate</b> use and renal damage in patients without preexisting renal dysfunction. - However, {{it is likely that}} patients with preexisting renal dysfunction and other risk factors were not sufficiently represented and analysed in these studies, and may be at increased risk of (further) renal damage through <b>sodium</b> <b>phosphate.</b> - Recommendations for clinical practice: 1. Routine determination of renal function through GFR estimation before prescription of bowel cleansing preparations containing <b>sodium</b> <b>phosphate.</b> 2. If <b>sodium</b> <b>phosphate</b> is administered, sufficient hydration is crucial: 2 L of fluids should be consumed with each 90 ml bottle of Colophos®. 3. <b>Sodium</b> <b>phosphate</b> should not be used in patients with preexisting renal dysfunction (GFR < 60 ml/min), and in those with other risk factors (heart failure, concomitant use of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and diuretics, preexisting dehydration and electrolyte disorders, old age). Bowel preparations containing polyethylene glycol (e. g., Cololyt®) should be given to these patients...|$|R
