40|$|Abstract- eAssessment saves human work by {{automating}} {{presentation and}} marking, but also enables {{new forms of}} testing of interest for engineering education. Authoring reliable, high quality assessment content is a difficult and costly task. Public content repositories populated with stand-alone items of assessment content enable authors and teachers {{to set up an}} exam by selection and ordering, with little additional effort. Reusable, shareable assessment objects require conformance to <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>packaging</b> and transportability. After revising eAssessment tools and content creation standards, this article identifies some popular learning platforms, authoring tools and public repositories, and verifies their standards compliance. Most popular learning platforms support packaging standards, but not assessment content transportability. Though some outstanding examples exist, {{there is a need for}} more public objects repositories and a deeper engagement in standards compliance. Government agencies and educational organizations have a role to play as the most powerful driving forces towards standards adoption for reusable content creation and sharing. Research in tools to aid education practitioners will be always valued, and can be carried on with rough consensus and small funding. Index Terms- eAssessment, eLearning, IMS QTI, SCORM...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND : South African nuclear {{medicine}} imaging departments have been fortunate {{in being able}} to receive an uninterrupted supply of molybdenum- 99 (99 Mo) /technetium- 99 m (99 mTc) generators. Nuclear medicine radiographers practising in private sector services in the northern Gauteng region indicated a possible problem with the quantities of wasted and unused 99 mTc radiopharmaceuticals returned to the radiopharmaceutical supply laboratory. Daily radiopharmaceutical deliveries are a combination <b>of</b> ordered <b>packages</b> and <b>standard</b> <b>packages.</b> The purpose <b>of</b> the <b>standard</b> <b>package</b> is to accommodate emergency and after-hours {{nuclear medicine}} services. The {{purpose of the study was}} to interrogate the unconfirmed reports of 99 mTc radiopharmaceutical wastage. METHODS: A descriptive quantitative research design was conducted in six private sector nuclear medicine imaging practices in the northern Gauteng region. Overt observations of the quantities of radiopharmaceutical supply, usage and wastage were conducted over 2 days in each of these practices. RESULTS : Ordered packages comprised 14 % of the total 99 mTc radiopharmaceutical deliveries to these six nuclear medicine imaging departments. It was identified that: (1) a total of 83. 2 % <b>of</b> ordered <b>packages</b> and 35. 1 % <b>of</b> <b>standard</b> <b>packages</b> <b>of</b> preprepared syringes were utilized; (2) a total of 36 % <b>of</b> ordered <b>packages</b> and 22. 6 % <b>of</b> <b>standard</b> <b>packages</b> <b>of</b> bulk 99 mTc were utilized; and (3) a total of 70. 6 % of the total quantity of radiopharmaceuticals was returned to the radiopharmaceutical laboratory. The total wastage represented 45. 5 % <b>of</b> the ordered <b>packages</b> and 75. 8 % <b>of</b> the <b>standard</b> <b>packages.</b> CONCLUSION : Wastage of 74 GBq of 99 mTc from six sites over 12 days should raise concerns for the nuclear medicine industry. A review of the system framework that supports communication between the radiopharmaceutical supplier/s and the nuclear medicine imaging practices is recommended. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Today, the design, use and {{distribution}} <b>of</b> <b>standard</b> application <b>packages</b> are changing {{due to the}} emergence of service orientation. In the private sector, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems are extended to include IT services. In the public sector, standard application packages are integrated with IT services which are often referred to as e-Government. E-Government can be extended with mobile technology to add mobility to public processes, so called m-Government. The problem addressed in this thesis is how to improve organizational effectiveness through the use <b>of</b> <b>standard</b> application <b>packages</b> and IT services. The objectives are to: ­Develop a model for explaining the level of adoption of extended ERP among small and medium sized companies.    ­Identify implications and design patterns of business models for service oriented ERP. ­Establish principles for the design of local government m-services. ­Develop a method for benefits evaluation of information systems with integrated services. The thesis contributes with theory for analyzing, explaining and predicting how the use <b>of</b> <b>standard</b> application <b>packages</b> as well as IT services affects organizational effectiveness. To practice, it provides new concepts that can change the perceptions and mental models that IS-professionals, such as management consultants, use in their professional lives. In particular, it provides implications, design principles, a model and a method for the use of services in conjunction with standard application packages in public and private sector organizations. For future research it is suggested to investigate how service orientation affects implementation methods for standard application packages and to investigate the requirements of completely integrated e-Government on e-services, business models and back-office systems.
