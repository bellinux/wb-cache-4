5000|$|Opsismodysplasia {{is a type}} of {{skeletal}} dysplasia (a bone {{disease that}} interferes with bone development) first described by Zonana and associates in 1977, and designated under its current name by Maroteaux (1984). Derived from the Greek opsismos ("late"), the name [...] "opsismodysplasia" [...] describes a delay in bone maturation. In addition to this delay, the disorder is characterized by [...] (short or undersized bones), particularly of the hands and feet, delay of ossification (bone cell formation), platyspondyly (flattened vertebrae), irregular metaphyses, an array of facial aberrations and respiratory distress related to chronic infection. Opsismodysplasia is congenital, being apparent at birth. It has a variable mortality, with some affected individuals living to adulthood. The disorder is rare, with an incidence of less than 1 per 1,000,000 worldwide. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means the defective (mutated) gene that causes the disorder is located on an autosome, and the disorder occurs when two copies of this defective gene are inherited. No specific gene {{has been found to be}} associated with the disorder. It is similar to <b>spondylometaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia,</b> Sedaghatian type.|$|E
40|$|Dysspondyloenchondromatosis (DSC) {{is a rare}} {{skeletal}} dysplasia {{that has}} currently been classified into the group of <b>spondylometaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasias.</b> To date, only 12 affected individuals have been reported. All cases are sporadic, and the etiology remains unknown. Distinctive features of DSC are anisospondyly and enchondroma-like lesions in the metaphyseal and diaphyseal portions of the long tubular bones. Affected individuals usually develop kyphoscoliosis and asymmetric limb shortening at an early age. Interestingly, some of the skeletal changes overlap with spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia (SEMD) Strudwick type, a rare type II collagen disorder. Based on this resemblance we postulated that DSC may be allelic to SEMD Strudwick type and therefore performed a COL 2 A 1 analysis in an affected boy who was diagnosed as having DSC {{at the age of}} 3 years. The identification of a novel heterozygous COL 2 A 1 missense mutation (p. Gly 753 Asp) in the proband confirms our hypothesis and suggests that DSC may be another type II collagen disorder...|$|R
40|$|The <b>spondylometaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasias</b> (SMDs) are a {{group of}} short-stature {{disorders}} distinguished by abnormalities in the ver-tebrae and the metaphyses of the tubular bones. SMD Kozlowski type (SMDK) is a well-defined autosomal-dominant SMD characterized by significant scoliosis and mild metaphyseal abnormalities in the pelvis. The vertebrae exhibit platyspondyly and overfaced pedicles similar to autosomal-dominant brachyolmia, which can result from heterozygosity for activating mutations in the gene encoding TRPV 4, a calcium-permeable Ion channel. Mutation analysis in six out of six patients with SMDK demonstrated heterozygosity for missense mutations in TRPV 4, and one mutation, predicting a R 594 H substitution, was recurrent in four patients. Similar to autosomal-dominant brachyolmia, the mutations altered basal calcium channel activity in vitro. Metatropic dysplasia is another SMD that has been proposed to have both clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Patients with the nonlethal form of metatropic dysplasia present with a progressive scoliosis, widespread metaphyseal involvement of the appendicular skeleton, and carpal ossification delay. Because of some similar radiographic features between SMDK and metatropic dysplasia, 'FRPV 4 was tested as a disease gene for nonlethal metatropic dysplasia. In two sporadic cases, heterozygosity for de novo missense mutations in TRPV 4 was found. The findings demonstrate that mutations in TRPV 4 produce a phenotypic spectrum of skeletal dysplasias from the mild autosomal-dominant brachyolmia to SMDK to autosomal-dominant metatropic dysplasia, suggesting that these disorders should be grouped into a new bone dysplasia family. status: publishe...|$|R

In our study, 12 patients (6 families) with H-SMD were identified and underwent comprehensive assessment accompanied by whole-exome sequencing (WES). Pedigree analysis in all families was consistent with X-linked recessive inheritance. Presentation typically occurred between 12 and 36 months. In addition to the two disease-defining features of <b>spondylometaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> and hypomyelination on MRI, common clinical signs and symptoms included motor deterioration, spasticity, tremor, ataxia, dysarthria, cognitive defects, pulmonary hypertension, nystagmus, and vision loss due to retinopathy. The course of the disease was slowly progressive. All patients had maternally inherited or de novo mutations in or near exon 7 of AIFM 1, within a region of 70 bp, including synonymous and intronic changes. AIFM 1 mutations have previously been associated with neurologic presentations as varied as intellectual disability, hearing loss, neuropathy, and striatal necrosis, while AIFM 1 mutations in this small region present with a distinct phenotype implicating bone.

However, all the epiphyses were normal. Laboratory studies were essentially normal except for an extremely raised serum alkaline phosphatase in the infant.

The spectrum of diagnoses included multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, diastrophic dysplasia, metaphyseal dysplasia, <b>spondylometaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia,</b> Stickler syndrome, Kniest dysplasia, and anauxetic dysplasia. Complex treatment, which included axial correction and juxta-articular realignment, was performed as a single-stage, or consecutive surgery. Surgical techniques included corrective osteotomies with internal fixation, guided growth technique and external fixation devices. Best results (full axial correction, normal alignment of the joint) were achieved in 8 patients, including 2 patients with metaphyseal dysplasia, 2 patients with multiple epyphyseal dysplasia, 2 patients with spondyloepyphyseal dysplasia, patient with Stickler syndrome and patient with <b>spondylometaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia.</b> Good results (partial correction at the present time) were seen in 4 patients (2 patients with Kniest dysplasia, 1 - with multiple epyphyseal dysplasia and 1 - with anauxetic dysplasia).

The genetic etiology of SMD is currently unknown; however, the type X collagen gene (COL 10 A 1) is considered an excellent candidate, for two reasons: first, Schmid metaphyseal chondrodysplasia, a condition known to result from COL 10 A 1 mutations, shows a significant phenotypic overlap with SMD; and, second, transgenic mice carrying deletions in type X collagen show SMD phenotypes. Hence, we examined the entire coding region of COL 10 A 1 by direct sequencing of DNA from five unrelated patients with SMD and found a heterozygous missense mutation (Gly 595 Glu) cosegregating with the disease phenotype in one SMD family.

40|$|Abstract Background The TRPV 4 gene encodes a calcium-permeable ion-channel that {{is widely}} expressed, {{responds}} to many different stimuli and participates in an extraordinarily {{wide range of}} physiologic processes. Autosomal dominant brachyolmia, <b>spondylometaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> Kozlowski type (SMDK) and metatropic dysplasia (MD) are currently considered three distinct skeletal dysplasias with some shared clinical features, including short stature, platyspondyly, and progressive scoliosis. Recently, TRPV 4 mutations {{have been found in}} patients diagnosed with these skeletal phenotypes. Methods and Results We critically analysed the clinical and radiographic data on 26 subjects from 21 families, all of whom had a clinical diagnosis of one of the conditions described above: 15 with MD; 9 with SMDK; and 2 with brachyolmia. We sequenced TRPV 4 and identified 9 different mutations in 22 patients, 4 previously described, and 5 novel. There were 4 mutation-negative cases: one with MD and one with SMDK, both displaying atypical clinical and radiographic features for these diagnoses; and two with brachyolmia, who had isolated spine changes and no metaphyseal involvement. Conclusions Our data suggest the TRPV 4 skeletal dysplasias represent a continuum of severity with areas of phenotypic overlap, even within the same family.

A heterozygous stop mutation in the known SRTD gene WDR 60 was identified in the remaining case; no novel candidate gene/s were suggested by homozygous/compound heterozygous analysis. This case was thus considered unsolved. Re-analysis following an analysis pipeline update identified a homozygous mutation in C 21 orf 2 (c. 218 G > C; p. Arg 73 Pro). This homozygous variant was previously removed at the quality control stage by the default GATK parameter “in-breeding co-efficient. ” C 21 orf 2 was recently associated with both Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (JATD) and axial <b>spondylometaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> (axial SMD); this particular mutation was reported in homozygous and compound heterozygous state in both conditions.

Identification of a homozygous C 21 orf 2 mutation in this case emphasizes the value of exome sequencing for simultaneously screening known genes and identifying novel genes. Additionally, it highlights the importance of re-interrogating data both as novel gene associations are identified and as analysis pipelines are refined.

Since the original description, only four further individuals have been reported (one sib pair and two unrelated cases). We report on an additional six individuals, including a second sib pair (brother and sister), with clinical and radiographic features that cluster and thus confirm the nosologic status of this entity. The main radiographic features are congenital platyspondyly with coronal clefts, severe metaphyseal changes particularly of the hands, wrists, and knees, mesomelic limb shortening, and coxa valga. The main physical signs are short stature, joint laxity, narrow chest, scoliosis, and DI.

The disorder has not {{attracted much attention}} since initially reported; however, it has {{been included in the}} nosology of genetic skeletal disorders [Warman et al. (2011); Am J Med Genet Part A 155 A: 943 - 968] in part because of a recent publication of two additional cases [Isidor et al. (2010); Am J Med Genet Part A 152 A: 1550 - 1554]. We report here on the clinical and radiological manifestations in seven affected individuals from five families (three sporadic cases and two familial cases). Based on our observations and Isidor's report, the clinical and radiological hallmarks of axial SMD can be defined: The main clinical findings are postnatal growth failure, rhizomelic short stature in early childhood evolving into short trunk in late childhood, and thoracic hypoplasia that may cause mild to moderate respiratory problems in the neonatal period and later susceptibility to airway infection. Impaired visual acuity comes to medical attention in early life and function rapidly deteriorates. Retinal changes are diagnosed as retinitis pigmentosa or pigmentary retinal degeneration on fundoscopic examination and cone-rod dystrophy on electroretinogram. The radiological hallmarks include short ribs with flared, cupped anterior ends, mild spondylar dysplasia, lacy iliac crests, and metaphyseal irregularities essentially confined to the proximal femora.

40|$|Dominant {{mutations}} in the receptor calcium channel gene TRPV 4 {{have been associated}} with a family of skeletal dysplasias (metatropic dysplasia, pseudo-Morquio type 2, <b>spondylometaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia,</b> Kozlowski type, brachyolmia, and familial digital arthropathy) as well as with dominantly inherited neuropathies (hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 2 C, scapuloperoneal spinal muscular atrophy, and congenital distal spinal muscular atrophy). While there is phenotypic overlap between the various members of each group, the two groups were considered to be totally separate with the former being strictly a structural skeletal condition and the latter group being confined to the peripheral nervous system. We report here on fetal akinesia as the presenting feature of severe metatropic dysplasia, suggesting that certain TRPV 4 mutations can cause both a skeletal and a neuropathic phenotype. Three cases were detected on prenatal ultrasound because of absent movements in the second trimester. Case 4 presented with multiple joint contractures and absent limb movements at birth and was diagnosed with "fetal akinesia syndrome". Post-interruption and post-natal X-rays showed typical features of metatropic dysplasia in all four. Sequencing of the TRPV 4 gene confirmed the presence of de novo heterozygous mutations predicting G 78 W (Case 1), T 740 I (Cases 2 and 3), and K 276 E (Case 4). Although some degree of restriction of movements is not uncommon in fetuses with skeletal dysplasia, akinesia as leading sign is unusual and suggests that certain TRPV 4 mutations produce both chondrodysplasia and a peripheral neuropathy resulting in a severe "overlap" phenotype. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. status: publishe...|$|E

Several rare variant phenotypes that have some overlap but deviate in some ways from the general pattern have also been described. The known variant phenotypes are spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia Maroteaux type (Pseudo-Morquio type 2), parastremmatic dysplasia, and familial digital arthropathy with brachydactyly. Interestingly, different TRPV 4 mutations {{have been associated with}} dominantly inherited neurologic disorders such as congenital spinal muscular atrophy and hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy. Finally, a small number of patients have been identified in whom a TRPV 4 mutation results in a phenotype combining skeletal dysplasia with peripheral neuropathy. The TRPV 4 gene encodes a regulated calcium channel implicated in multiple and diverse cellular processes. Over 50 different TRPV 4 mutations have been reported, with two codons appearing to be mutational hot spots: P 799 in exon 15, mostly associated with MD, and R 594 in exon 11, associated with SMDK. While most pathogenic mutations tested so far result in activation of the calcium channel in vitro, the mechanisms through which TRPV 4 activation results in skeletal dysplasia and/or peripheral neuropathy remain unclear and the genotype-phenotype correlations in this group of disorders remains somewhat mysterious.

Only a total of seven missense mutations were detected, however. The full spectrum of TRPV 4 mutations and their phenotypes remained unclear. Objectives and methods To examine TRPV 4 mutation spectrum and phenotype-genotype association, we searched for TRPV 4 mutations by PCR-direct sequencing from genomic DNA in 22 MD and 20 SMDK probands. Results TRPV 4 mutations were found {{in all but one}} MD subject. In total, 19 different heterozygous mutations were identified in 41 subjects; two were recurrent and 17 were novel. In MD, a recurrent P 799 L mutation was identified in nine subjects, as well as 10 novel mutations including F 471 del, the first deletion mutation of TRPV 4. In SMDK, a recurrent R 594 H mutation was identified in 12 subjects and seven novel mutations. An association between the position of mutations and the disease phenotype was also observed. Thus, P 799 in exon 15 is a hot codon for MD mutations, as four different amino acid substitutions have been observed at this codon; while R 594 in exon 11 is a hotspot for SMDK mutations. Conclusion The TRPV 4 mutation spectrum in MD and SMDK, which showed genotype-phenotype correlation and potential functional significance of mutations that are non-randomly distributed over the gene, was presented in this study.

40|$|Background—Schneckenbecken {{dysplasia}} (SBD) is an {{autosomal recessive}} lethal skeletal dysplasia that is classified into the severe spondylodysplastic dysplasias (SSDD) {{group in the}} international nosology for skeletal dysplasias. The radiological hallmark of SBD is the snaillike configuration of the hypoplastic iliac bone. SLC 35 D 1 (solute carrier- 35 D 1) is a nucleotide-sugar transporter involved in proteoglycan synthesis. Recently, based on human and mouse genetic studies, we showed that loss-of-function mutations of the SLC 35 D 1 gene (SLC 35 D 1) cause SBD. Object—To explore further the range of SLC 35 D 1 mutations in SBD and elucidate whether SLC 35 D 1 mutations cause other skeletal dysplasias that belong to the SSDD group. Methods and results—We searched for SLC 35 D 1 mutations in five families with SBD and 15 patients with other SSDD group diseases, including achodrogenesis type 1 A, <b>spondylometaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> Sedaghatian type and fibrochondrogenesis. We identified four novel mutations, c. 319 C>T (p. R 107 X), IVS 4 + 3 A>G, a 4959 -bp deletion causing the removal of exon 7 (p. R 178 fsX 15), and c. 193 A>C (p. T 65 P), in three SBD families. Exon trapping assay showed IVS 4 + 3 A>G caused skipping of exon 4 and a frameshift (p. L 109 fsX 18). Yeast complementation assay showed the T 65 P mutant protein lost the transporter activity of nucleotide sugars. Therefore, all these mutations result in loss of function. No SLC 35 D 1 mutations were identified in all patients with other SSDD group diseases.

We sequenced TRPV 4 and identified 9 different mutations in 22 patients, 4 previously described, and 5 novel. There were 4 mutation-negative cases: one with MD and one with SMDK, both displaying atypical clinical and radiographic features for these diagnoses; and two with brachyolmia, who had isolated spine changes and no metaphyseal involvement. Conclusions: Our data suggest the TRPV 4 skeletal dysplasias represent a continuum of severity with areas of phenotypic overlap, even within the same family. We propose that AD brachyolmia lies at the mildest end of this spectrum and, since all cases described with this diagnosis and TRPV 4 mutations display metaphyseal changes, we suggest {{that it is not a}} distinct entity but represents the mildest phenotypic expression of SMDK.

40|$|Collagen X is {{produced}} by hypertrophic cartilage undergoing endochondral ossification. Transgenic mice expressing defective collagen X {{under the control of}} 4. 7 - or 1. 6 -kb chicken collagen X regulatory sequences yielded skeleto-hematopoietic defects (Jacenko O, LuValle P, Olsen BR: <b>Spondylometaphyseal</b> <b>dysplasia</b> in mice carrying a dominant-negative mutation in a matrix protein specific for cartilage-to-bone transition. Nature 1993, 365 : 56 – 61; Jacenko O, Chan D, Franklin A, Ito S, Underhill CB, Bateman JF, Campbell MR: A dominant interference collagen X mutation disrupts hypertrophic chondrocyte pericellular matrix and glycosaminoglycan and proteoglycan distribution in transgenic mice. Am J Pathol 2001, 159 : 2257 – 2269; Jacenko O, Roberts DW, Campbell MR, McManus PM, Gress CJ, Tao Z: Linking hematopoiesis to endochondral ossification through analysis of mice transgenic for collagen X. Am J Pathol 2002, 160 : 2019 – 2034). Current data indicate that the hematopoietic abnormalities do not result from extraskeletal expression of endogenous collagen X or the transgene. Organs from mice carrying either promoter were screened by immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and Northern blot; transgene and mouse collagen X proteins and messages were detected only in hypertrophic cartilage. Likewise, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction revealed both transgene and mouse collagen X amplicons only in the endochondral skeleton of mice with the 4. 7 -kb promoter; however, in mice with the 1. 6 -kb promoter, multiple organs were transgene-positive. Collagen X and transgene amplicons were also detected in marrow, but likely resulted from contaminating trabecular bone; this was supported by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of rat tibial zones free of trabeculae. Our data demonstrate that in mice, the 4. 7 -kb chicken collagen X promoter restricts transcription temporo-spatially to that of endogenous collagen X, and imply that murine skeleto-hematopoietic defects result from transgene co-expression with collagen X. Moreover, the 4. 7 -kb hypertrophic cartilage-specific promoter could be used for targeting transgenes to this tissue site in mice...|$|E
