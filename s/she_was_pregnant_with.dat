5|$|A popular legend imbues {{the birth}} of Ralambo with a mystical character. The legend relates that his mother, who was known in her youth as Ramaitsoanala ("Green Forest"), was the {{daughter}} of the Vazimba water goddess Ivorombe ("Great Bird"). With the assistance of her celestial mother, Ramaitsoanala confronted and overcame numerous obstacles. After her marriage to Andriamanelo (whereupon she assumed the name Queen Randapavola), one of these obstacles took the form of reproductive difficulties: six consecutive times Randapavola miscarried or lost her children in infancy. When <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>with</b> her seventh child, the queen was especially afraid for her unborn child because the number seven was traditionally associated with death. This time, Randapavola sought the guidance of an astrologer to protect the unborn child from an evil fate. On his advice she chose to defy the tradition of delivering the baby at her parents' home village of Ambohidrabiby, rather choosing the village of Alasora, to the north of Antananarivo, because this cardinal direction embodied great power. According to the tale, the queen gave birth in a house built to resemble a boat (called a kisambosambo) evocative of the transoceanic origins of the Malagasy people. There, Randapavola took the name Rasolobe upon delivering a healthy son, Ralambo, {{on the first day of}} the first month of the year (Alahamady), the most auspicious date for {{the birth of}} a sovereign.|$|E
5|$|Peggy married Eric Mitchell because <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>with</b> Phil (Steve McFadden). Eric, a keen boxer, {{worked for}} gangster Johnny Allen (Billy Murray). Johnny would taunt Eric, making him do demeaning jobs because Eric {{was a better}} boxer than him. Eric {{fell in love with}} a woman called Maureen and planned to elope with her, but changed his mind, unable to desert his family, who he grew to resent. Eric took his anger out on Peggy and was often violent towards her and Phil. The abuse {{eventually}} ended when Peggy told the police that Eric was involved in a Post Office robbery and he was sent to prison. Peggy considered leaving when her sons, Phil and Grant (Ross Kemp) were teenagers, and once even tried to seduce Johnny, but he turned her down. Eric cheated on Peggy with Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas), who he also intended to run away with, but changed his mind, leading to Claudette hating the entire family. Peggy turned to Eric's younger brother Archie (Larry Lamb) because he was there for her when Eric began to abuse her. She tried to save her marriage by having another child in 1975 - her only daughter Samantha (Danniella Westbrook and Kim Medcalf). Her relationship with Eric improved, but only temporarily, and when Kevin Masters (Colin McCormack) employed Peggy to work at his minicab firm, they began a secret affair. When Eric developed cancer, Peggy gave up work to care for him, but Kevin returned promptly after Eric's death in 1985 and Peggy's children took against him.|$|E
