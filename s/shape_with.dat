40|$|This paper {{describes}} a technique for analyzing <b>shapes</b> <b>with</b> potential symmetry employing symmetric subsets. The proposed technique {{assumes that the}} shapes interested have potential bilateral symmetry. The notion of potential symmetry is given to those <b>shapes</b> <b>with</b> approximate or original symmetry. As respective examples, we can imagine a human face and a partial broken vase. Although their symmetric structures need be identified for their meaninghl analysis, very few researchers have ever discussed symmetry identification of those <b>shapes</b> <b>with</b> potential symmetry. The present paper proposes a technique for identifying planes of symmetry on the <b>shapes</b> <b>with</b> potential bilateral symmetry employing the idea of symmetric subsets. The proposed technique is applied to asymmetry analysis of human skulls, and some experimental results employing real CT images of human heads are shown with discussion. 1...|$|R

5|$|The spores are {{translucent}} (hyaline), smooth, have {{an ellipsoid}} <b>shape,</b> <b>with</b> dimensions of 12–16 by 3–5µm. Spores contain {{one or two}} oil droplets. The imperfect (conidial) form of the fungus produces smooth, hyaline spores that are 3–3.5 by 1–2µm. The asci – sexual spore-bearing cells – have a cylindrical <b>shape,</b> <b>with</b> dimensions of 115–125 by 8–10µm. The paraphyses (sterile filamentous cells interspersed among the asci) are cylindrical with slightly swollen tips, and few branches.|$|E
5|$|A {{powerful}} Senate Select Committee {{oversaw the}} NCDC and renowned British architect Sir William Holford {{was brought in}} to fine-tune Griffin's original plans. He changed the central basin's geometry so that it was no longer a segment of circle; he converted the southern straight edge into a polygonal <b>shape</b> <b>with</b> three edges and inserted a gulf on the northern shore. The result was closer to Scrivener's modified design some decades earlier.|$|E

5|$|According {{to a local}} atlas, Mountain Grove Campground was semicircular in <b>shape,</b> <b>with</b> avenues {{radiating}} out {{towards the}} sides. An open space for worshiping was on the camp meeting site, and it was surrounded by more tents. When this area was filled up, more people would set up tents along the avenues that radiated outward from the camp.|$|E
5|$|Danvers carrots. These {{have strong}} foliage and the roots are longer than Chantaney types, {{and they have}} a conical <b>shape</b> <b>with</b> a {{well-defined}} shoulder, tapering to a point. They are somewhat shorter than Imperator cultivars, but more tolerant of heavy soil conditions. Danvers cultivars store well and are used both fresh and for processing. They were developed in 1871 in Danvers, Massachusetts. Cultivars include 'Danvers Half Long' and 'Danvers 126'.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{the final}} design was agreed in 1723, and it {{incorporated}} {{the work of}} de Tigné as well as Charles François de Mondion, the Order's military engineer. The new fort was to be square in <b>shape,</b> <b>with</b> four bastions and two cavaliers. The fort was financed by, and named after, the Portuguese Grand Master, António Manoel de Vilhena. He also set up the Manoel Foundation, a fund responsible for the maintenance and garrison of Fort Manoel and its outworks.|$|E

5|$|Feeding {{is usually}} {{in small groups}} and the bird takes mainly insects. Breeding usually starts in March, with the birds {{building}} their nest high in an acacia tree. The birds usually lay five to six cream eggs with lilac blotches. The nest itself is globular in <b>shape</b> <b>with</b> a tubular entrance on top. It is possible that {{more than just the}} breeding pair visit the nest and that the young of previous years help in rearing the young.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to basic troops, there are Hunters, or Mgalekgolo, (from the planet Te) who according to Bungie's mythology are collectives of worm-like aliens, singularly known as Lekgolo, encased in tough armor. Initial concepts were less humanoid-looking and softer than the final <b>shape,</b> <b>with</b> angular shields and razor-sharp spines.|$|E
5|$|In deposit, the spore {{color of}} Rhodotus palmatus has been {{described}} most commonly as pink, but also as cream colored. Viewed microscopically, the spores of Rhodotus have a roughly spherical <b>shape,</b> <b>with</b> dimensions of 6–7.2 by 5.6–6.5µm; the spore surface is marked with numerous wart-like projections (defined as verricose), typically 0.5–0.7µm long. The spores are non-amyloid—unable to take up iodine stain in the chemical test with Melzer's reagent.|$|E

5|$|Like many Elizabethan mansions, Barrington {{is built}} in an 'E' <b>shape</b> <b>with</b> large {{projecting}} wings with square projections that contain staircases. The {{house is not}} truly symmetrical as the hall has two lights and the buttery one. The south front has seven gables supported by octagonal buttresses and decorated with twisted finials with ogee scale-work caps and English Crockets.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{majority}} of medieval cathedrals, those of England are cruciform. While most are of the Latin Cross <b>shape</b> <b>with</b> a single transept, several including Salisbury, Lincoln, Wells and Canterbury have two transepts, which is a distinctly English characteristic. The transepts, unlike those of many French cathedrals, always project strongly. The cathedral, whether of monastic or secular foundation, often has several clearly defined subsidiary buildings, in particular the chapter house and cloister.|$|E
