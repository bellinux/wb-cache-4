40|$|Quorum sensing (QS) {{is a type}} of cell-cell {{communication}} using signal {{molecules that}} are released and detected by cells, which respond to changes in their population density. A few studies explain that QS may operate in a density-dependent manner; however, due to experimental challenges, this fundamental hypothesis has never been investigated. Here, we present a microfluidic static droplet array (SDA) that combines a droplet generator with hydrodynamic traps to independently generate a bacterial population gradient into a parallel series of droplets under complete chemical and physical isolation. The SDA independently manipulates both a chemical concentration gradient and a bacterial population density. In addition, the bacterial population gradient in the SDA can be tuned by a simple change in the number of sample plug loading. Finally, the method allows the direct analysis of complicated biological events in an addressable droplet to enable the characterization of bacterial communication in response to the ratio of two microbial populations, including two genetically engineered QS circuits, such as the <b>signal</b> <b>sender</b> for acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) production and the signal receiver bacteria for green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression induced by AHL. For the first time, we found that the population ratio of the <b>signal</b> <b>sender</b> and receiver indicates a significant and potentially interesting partnership between microbial communities. Therefore, we envision that this simple SDA could be a useful platform in various research fields, including analytical chemistry, combinatorial chemistry, synthetic biology, microbiology, and molecular biology. close 4...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{equilibrium}} refinement in signaling models.

We identify conditions for an equilibrium to satisfy the LCT in both the finite and continuous type cases, and demonstrate that the conditions are identical as we take the limit in the finite type case. Intuitively, the conditions for an equilibrium to survive our LCT test require that a measure of signaling “effectiveness ” is sufficiently high for every type and that the type distribution is not tilted upwards too much. We then apply the characterization results to several signaling applications...|$|R

As modulation methodologies deliver different BERs at a given SNR, they determine the system performance and sensitivity.

40|$|SummaryAnimal {{signals are}} {{optimized}} for particular signaling environments [1 – 3]. While <b>signaling,</b> <b>senders</b> often choose favorable conditions that ensure reliable detection and transmission [4 – 8], {{suggesting that they}} are sensitive to changes in signal efficacy. Recent evidence has also shown that animals will increase the amplitude or intensity of their acoustic signals at times of increased environmental noise [9 – 11]. The nature of these adjustments provides important insights into sensory processing. However, only {{a single piece of}} correlative evidence for signals defined by movement suggests that visual-signal design depends on ambient motion noise [12]. Here we show experimentally {{for the first time that}} animals communicating with movement will adjust their displays when environmental motion noise increases. Surprisingly, under sustained wind conditions, the Australian lizard Amphibolurus muricatus changed the structure and increased the duration of its introductory tail flicking, rather than increasing signaling speed. The way these lizards restructure the alerting component of their movement-based aggressive display in the presence of increased motion noise highlights the challenge we face in understanding motion-detection mechanisms under natural operating conditions...|$|R

The aim {{of this paper is to}} characterize, by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), the lipophilic fraction of precloacal gland secretions of adult males and females of the lizard Liolaemus wiegmannii and evaluate intersexual differences in composition and proportion of their chemical profiles. We identified 48 and 41 lipohilic compounds in males and females, respectively. The main compounds were steroids and waxy esters. We also found squalene, alcohols, aldehydes and carboxylic acids. Overall, we found significant differences between sexes with respect to the relative proportions of compounds. We also found differences in proportions of three of the five predominant compounds shared by both sexes (squalene, cholesta- 3, 5 -dien and cholesta- 2, 4 -dien).

However, the influence of patriline diversity on the attention paid to these signals by audiences of potentially receptive workers remains unexplored. To determine whether recruitment dances performed by foragers in multiple-patriline colonies attract a greater number of dance followers than dances in colonies that lack patriline diversity, we trained workers from multiple- and single-patriline colonies to forage in a greenhouse and monitored their dance-following activity back in the hives. On average, more workers followed a dance if it was performed in a multiple-patriline colony rather than a single-patriline colony (33 % increase), and for a greater number of dance circuits per follower. Furthermore, dance-following workers in multiple-patriline colonies were more likely to exit their hive after following a dance, although this did not translate to a difference in colony-level exit rates between treatment types. Recruiting nest mates to profitable food sources through dance communication is critical to a colony’s foraging success and long-term fitness; polyandrous queens produce colonies that benefit not only from increased recruitment signalling, but also from the generation of larger and more attentive audiences of signal receivers.

40|$|Thrips {{have several}} {{advantages}} {{that make them}} particularly suitable {{for the study of}} the evolution of alarm signalling. When in danger, thrips larvae defend themselves by the excretion of ‘anal droplets’: a predator touched by such a droplet interrupts the attack and switches to cleaning. These droplets may contain an alarm pheromone, consisting of two compounds: decyl acetate and dodecyl actetate. The presence of alarm pheromone evokes anti‐predator behaviour in thrips, such as elevated alertness and moving away from the scene, and this behaviour potentially improves the chances of survival of the signal receivers. Thrips larvae may encounter a range of predators, the one more dangerous than the other. If a thrips larva survives the presence of a predator, this larva may become a <b>signal</b> <b>sender</b> on a next occasion. Thrips live in groups, comprising both related and unrelated individuals. A practical advantage of the alarm pheromone of thrips is that synthetic mimics of its two components are available. The anal droplets can be observed, counted, collected and analysed for the presence and composition of pheromone. Furthermore, thrips larvae can be stimulated to produce droplets by prodding them with a fine brush. The combination of these advantages enables the manipulation of pheromone production as well as the determination of quality and quantity of the alarm pheromone in presence of various types of predator. Three main questions are central to this thesis. First, does the alarm pheromone of thrips larvae indeed improve the defensive capacities of conspecific thrips? Second, is thrips alarm pheromone production context‐dependent? And third, how does relatedness influence alarm communication...|$|R

Typically, NASA has relied mostly on the use of ThermoCouples (TC) for this type of thermal monitoring due to the variability of constraints required to accurately map rapidly changing temperatures from ambient to glowing hot chamber material. Obtaining accurate real-time temperatures in the JR spectrum is made even more elusive by the changing emissivity of the chamber material as it begins to glow. The parameters evaluated prior to APS testing included: (1) remote operation of the A 40 M camera using fiber optic Firewire <b>signal</b> <b>sender</b> and receiver units; (2) operation of the camera inside a Pelco explosion proof enclosure with a germanium window; (3) remote analog signal display for real-time monitoring; (4) remote digital data acquisition of the A 40 M's sensor information using FUR's ThermaCAM Researcher Pro 2. 8 software; and (5) overall reliability of the system.

30|$|The {{diversification}} of P. nyererei and P. pundamilia cichlids {{is considered to}} be a good example of speciation caused by sensory drives (Miyagi and Terai 2013). A hypothesis posits that closely related and morphologically similar species should differ in mating signals, which is mainly engendered by three processes: habitat transmission, perceptual tuning, and signal matching. Habitat transmission is important when the habitat physically degrades the intensity of the signal during transmission; therefore, it is advantageous for signals to have a long transmitting distance (Bradury and Vehrencamp 2011; Morrill et al. 2013). Perceptual tuning is the phenomenon whereby some individuals may be inherently more sensitive to certain stimuli, e.g., a specific wavelength of light or frequency of sound, than other organisms, which may be a consequence of adaptation to their habitat (Boughman 2002). Signal matching refers to intimate coupling between the evolution of sexual display in the <b>signal</b> <b>sender</b> and the development of sensory capabilities in the signal receiver (Fisher 1915; Kirkpatrick 1982). Usually, mating signals are compatible with the receiver’s perception capabilities, because a more detectable mating signal can increase the reproductive opportunities of the sender and reduce the search cost of the receiver (partner) (Dawkins and Guilford 1996), thereby improving reproductive success. Sensory drive speciation suggests that the gene flow between two sibling species is constrained during contact (Boughman 2002). Habitat transmission, perceptual tuning, and signal matching are all apparent in the two closely related Paratanakia subspecies examined in this study. Moreover, earlier genetic studies suggested that there is no gene flow between P. h. himantegus and P. h. chii (Chang et al. 2014; Chang et al. 2009 b), and therefore, it is possible that speciation by sensory drive promotes differentiation of these two bitterlings.|$|R

When our goal is to understand the adaptive significance of specific responses to specific signals by the receiver, questions about signal information are useful.

By making <b>signals,</b> a <b>sender</b> interfaces with the receiver’s model of the world and indirectly manipulates its behaviour. This is especially clear in cases of mimicry, where animals use deceptive signals that indirectly manipulate the behaviour of receivers.
