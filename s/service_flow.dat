One {{of the problems}} is that the available bandwidth is always being assigned to one or two greedy requests within the same service class which might cause bandwidth starvation and high packet latency to other <b>service</b> <b>flows.</b> Secondly, there could be some <b>service</b> <b>flows</b> which are not in critical condition but they are getting bandwidth. In fact, the mechanism should reduce some of the bandwidth and redistribute to others. Our proposed scheme takes into consideration of this issue and views it as a motivation to reallocate the bandwidth. The third issue is that the bandwidths are being assigned to some <b>service</b> <b>flows</b> while other <b>service</b> <b>flows</b> do not get any in a cycle. This is a shortcoming in bandwidth request and granting process. All the above issues will result in high delay and jitter to those <b>service</b> <b>flows</b> not allocated with any bandwidth. Hence, our proposed scheme applies bandwidth redistribution on some qualified requests. The qualified requests are decided by a factor point system which will be discussed later. With such approach, it will able to relieve bandwidth starvation in the network and subsequently lower the latency of packets.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Proliferation of Web {{technologies}} and the ubiquitous Internet {{has resulted in}} a tremendous increase in the need to deliver one-stop Web services, which are often composed of multiple component services that cross organizational boundaries. It is essential that these Web services, referred to in this paper as service flows, be carefully composed in a dynamic and customized manner to suit to the changing needs of the customers. This composition should be conducted in such a manner that (i) the composed <b>service</b> <b>flow</b> adheres to the policies imposed by the organizations offering the component services, (ii) the selected component services are compatible with one another so that the entire composition would result in a successful <b>service</b> <b>flow,</b> and (iii) the selected component services most closely meet the customer requirements. In this paper, we propose a policy-based Web service composition that utilizes the semantics associated with the component services. We consider policies imposed by different entities while composing service flows, which include service policies (imposed by the organizations offering component services), <b>service</b> <b>flow</b> policies (associated with the entire <b>service</b> <b>flow),</b> and user policies (the user requirements expressed as policies). In addition to these policies, one may consider rules at the syntactic and semantic levels {{that can be used to}} select relevant component services in order to compose customized service flows, by considering the notions of syntactic, semantic and policy compatibility.
