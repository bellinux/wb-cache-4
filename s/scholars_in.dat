5|$|Stichometry {{refers to}} the {{practice}} of counting lines in texts: Ancient Greeks and Romans measured the length of their books in lines, just as modern books are measured in pages.

Stichos is the Greek word for a 'line' of prose or poetry and the suffix '-metry' is derived from the Greek word for measurement.|$|E

Since its discovery, study of the Codex Sinaiticus has proven to be useful to scholars for critical studies of biblical text.|$|E

5|$|The {{impact of}} these {{religious}} developments on the culture, literature, and architecture in South India was profound. Important works of metaphysics and poetry based on the teachings of these philosophers were written over the next centuries. Akka Mahadevi, Allama Prabhu, {{and a host of}} Basavanna's followers, including Chenna Basava, Prabhudeva, Siddharama, and Kondaguli Kesiraja wrote hundreds of poems called Vachanas in praise of Lord Shiva. The esteemed <b>scholars</b> <b>in</b> the Hoysala court, Harihara and Raghavanka, were Virashaivas. This tradition continued into the Vijayanagar empire with such well-known scholars as Singiraja, Mallanarya, Lakkana Dandesa and other prolific writers of Virashaiva literature. The Saluva, Tuluva and Aravidu dynasties of the Vijayanagar empire were followers of Vaishnavism and a Vaishnava temple with an image of Ramanujacharya exists today in the Vitthalapura area of Vijayanagara. <b>Scholars</b> <b>in</b> the succeeding Mysore Kingdom wrote Vaishnavite works supporting the teachings of Ramanujacharya. King Vishnuvardhana built many temples after his conversion from Jainism to Vaishnavism.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of genetic engineering, a whole new type of food has been brought into the world, and <b>scholars</b> <b>in</b> both academia and Judaic faith have differing {{viewpoints}} on whether these new strains of foods are to be considered kosher or not.

5|$|A further {{cause of}} the Lombard {{migration}} into Italy {{may have been an}} invitation from Narses. According to a controversial tradition reported by several medieval sources, Narses, out of spite for having been removed by Justinian's successor Justin II, called the Lombards to Italy. Often dismissed as an unreliable tradition, it has been studied with attention by modern <b>scholars,</b> <b>in</b> particular Neil Christie, who see in it a possible record of a formal invitation by the Byzantine state to settle in northern Italy as foederati, to help protect the region against the Franks, an arrangement that may have been disowned by Justin II after Narses' removal.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} factors, {{including}} the bizarre facts and Cardozo's outstanding reputation, {{made the case}} prominent in the legal profession, and it remains so, taught to {{most if not all}} American law students in torts class. Cardozo's conception, that tort liability only occurs when a defendant breaches a duty of care the defendant owes to a plaintiff, causing the injury sued for, has been widely accepted in American law. In dealing with proximate cause, many states have taken the approach championed by the Court of Appeals' dissenter in Palsgraf, Judge William S. Andrews. Some legal <b>scholars</b> <b>in</b> recent years have criticized Cardozo for not taking into account Palsgraf's impoverished circumstances.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the disputed}} {{statements}} of the ancient writers and some modern <b>scholars,</b> <b>in</b> Athens Aspasia became a hetaera and probably ran a brothel. Hetaerae were professional high-class entertainers, as well as courtesans. Besides displaying physical beauty, they differed from most Athenian women in being educated (often to a high standard, as in Aspasia's case), having independence, and paying taxes. They were the nearest thing perhaps to liberated women; and Aspasia, who became a vivid figure in Athenian society, was probably an obvious example. According to Plutarch, Aspasia was compared to the famous Thargelia, another renowned Ionian hetaera of ancient times.|$|E
5|$|After its {{dedication}} in 972, {{and with}} the hiring by mosque authorities of 35 <b>scholars</b> <b>in</b> 989, the mosque slowly developed into what is today the second oldest continuously run university in the world after Al Karaouine in Umayyad Fes. Al-Azhar University has long been regarded as the foremost institution in the Islamic world {{for the study of}} Sunni theology and sharia, or Islamic law. The university, integrated within the mosque as part of a mosque school since its inception, was nationalized and officially designated an independent university in 1961, following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952.|$|E

5|$|Anekāntavāda {{played a}} role in the history of Jainism in India, during {{intellectual}} debates from Śaivas, Vaiṣṇavas, Buddhists, Muslims, and Christians at various times. According to John Koller, professor of Asian studies, anekāntavāda allowed Jain thinkers to maintain the validity of their doctrine, while at the same time respectfully criticizing the views of their opponents. In other cases, it was a tool used by Jaina scholars to confront and dispute Buddhist <b>scholars</b> <b>in</b> ancient India, or in the case of Haribhadra justify the retaliation of the killing of his two nephews by Buddhist monks, with capital punishment for all Buddhist monks in the suspected monastery, according to the Buddhist version of Haribhadra's biography.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of Ranbir Singh, the temple complex became the centre of Sanskrit teachings to {{a large number of}} Brahmin students. A {{translation}} centre was also established as part of the temple where books on philosophy and history in Arabic and Persian languages were translated by Muslim scholars into Sanskrit. Like wise, Pundits translated many scriptures into Hindi and Dogri languages. This initiative taken by Maharaja Ranbir Singh to bring amity between the Hindu and Muslim communities was praised by Sir Aurel Stein as in:order to facilitate the exchange of ideas which the Maharaja in a spirit of true enlightenment desired to promote between the representatives of Hindu and Mohammedan <b>scholars</b> <b>in</b> his domain. The temple also houses a library, which has rare Sanskrit works.|$|E

In presidential ranking polls conducted in the United States since 1948, Lincoln has been rated at the very top in the majority of polls. Generally, the top three presidents are rated as 1. Lincoln; 2. George Washington; and 3. Franklin D. Roosevelt, although Lincoln and Washington, and Washington and Roosevelt, are occasionally reversed.|$|E

5|$|Interest in Monteverdi revived in {{the late}} 18th and early 19th centuries among music <b>scholars</b> <b>in</b> Germany and Italy, {{although}} he was still regarded as essentially a historical curiosity. Wider interest in the music itself began in 1881, when Robert Eitner published a shortened version of the Orfeo score. Around this time Kurt Vogel scored the madrigals from the original manuscripts, but more critical interest was shown in the operas, following {{the discovery of the}} L'incoronazione manuscript in 1888 and that of Il ritorno in 1904. Largely through the efforts of Vincent d'Indy, all three operas were staged in one form or other, during {{the first quarter of the}} 20th century: L'Orfeo in May 1911, L'incoronazione in February 1913 and Il ritorno in May 1925.|$|E
5|$|Lessons had a {{significant}} effect on the development of children's literature in Britain and the United States. Maria Edgeworth, Sarah Trimmer, Jane Taylor, and Ellenor Fenn, to name a few of the most illustrious, were inspired to become children's authors because of Lessons and their works dominated children's literature for several generations. Lessons itself was reprinted for over a century. However, because of the disrepute that educational writings fell into, largely due to the low esteem awarded Barbauld, Trimmer, and others by contemporary male Romantic writers, Barbauld's Lessons has rarely been studied by <b>scholars.</b> <b>In</b> fact, it has only been analysed in depth since the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The Bruges {{exhibition}} {{renewed interest}} in the period and initiated scholarship that was to flourish in the 20th century. Johan Huizinga was the first historian to place Netherlandish art squarely in the Burgundian period – outside of nationalistic borders – suggesting in his book The Waning of the Middle Ages, published in 1919, that the flowering of the school in the early 15th century resulted wholly from the tastes set by the Burgundian court. Another exhibition visitor, Georges Hulin de Loo, published an independent critical catalogue highlighting {{the large number of}} mistakes in the official catalogue, which had used attributions and descriptions from the owners. He and Max Friedländer, who visited and wrote a review of the Bruges exhibition, went on to become leading <b>scholars</b> <b>in</b> the field.|$|E
