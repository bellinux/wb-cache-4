40|$|This <b>study</b> <b>has</b> <b>found</b> {{evidence}} that occupational segregation is still present, as some traditionally feminine occupations (primary school teaching and nursing) comprise significantly {{more women than}} men. Furthermore, this <b>study</b> <b>has</b> <b>found</b> {{evidence that}} the earnings gender gap persists even in these occupations that continue {{to be dominated by}} women...|$|R

50|$|Brenna Bry {{and colleagues}} (1982) {{addressed}} {{the question of}} what causes drug use in adolescents. Previous research had made use of multiple regression; with this method, it is natural to look for the best predictor, the one with the highest beta weight. Bry and colleagues noted that one previous <b>study</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> that early use of alcohol was the best predictor. Another <b>study</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> that alienation from parents was the best predictor. Still another <b>study</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> that low grades in school were the best predictor. The failure to replicate was clearly a problem, a problem that could be caused by bouncing betas.|$|R
5|$|Recent <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> some {{traditional}} Russulaceae species to comprise several cryptic species (see Systematics and taxonomy: Species diversity). This may imply that distribution range and population size {{for each of}} such distinct species are smaller than previously thought.|$|E
5|$|<b>Studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> {{that the}} {{incidence}} of PTE ranges between 1.9 and more than 30% of TBI sufferers, varying by severity of injury and by the amount of time after TBI for which the studies followed subjects.|$|E
5|$|Use of topical aloe vera is not {{associated}} with significant side effects. Oral ingestion of aloe vera, however, may cause abdominal cramps and diarrhea which in turn can decrease the absorption of drugs. IARC <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> ingested non-decolorized liquid aloe vera to be carcinogenic in animals, and state {{that it is a}} possible carcinogen in humans as well.|$|E

5|$|Acrocanthosaurus is {{classified}} in the superfamily Allosauroidea within the infraorder Tetanurae. This superfamily is characterized by paired ridges on the nasal and lacrimal bones {{on top of the}} snout and tall neural spines on the neck vertebrae, among other features. It was originally placed in the family Allosauridae with Allosaurus, an arrangement also supported by studies as late as 2000. Most <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> it {{to be a member of}} the related family Carcharodontosauridae.|$|E
5|$|Genetics {{may play}} a role in the risk that a person will develop PTE; people with the ApoE-ε4 allele may be at higher risk for PTE. The {{haptoglobin}} Hp2-2 allele may be another genetic risk factor, possibly because it binds hemoglobin poorly and thus allows more iron to escape and damage tissues. However, most <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> that having family members with epilepsy does not significantly increase the risk of PTS, suggesting that genetics are not a strong risk factor.|$|E
5|$|Laboratory <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> that rice rats {{assimilate}} 88% to 95% of {{the energy}} in their food. They lose weight when fed on Spartina, fiddler crabs, or sunflower seeds alone, but a diet consisting of several of those items or of mealworms is adequate to maintain weight. In an experiment, marsh rice rats did not show hoarding behavior, but wild rice rats have been observed carrying food to a nest. Even when they live in uplands, they mostly eat water plants and animals, although they consume some upland plants.|$|E

5|$|Much {{research}} has been done into erection. By two years post-injury, 80% of men recover at least partial erectile function, though many experience problems with the reliability and duration of their erections if they do not use interventions to enhance them. <b>Studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> that half or up to 65% of men with SCI have orgasms, although the experience may feel different than it did before the injury. Most men say it feels weaker, and takes longer and more stimulation to achieve.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{studies have}} been {{performed}} on data from large populations of children to study {{the relationship between the}} use of vaccines containing thiomersal, and autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Almost all of these <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> no association between thiomersal-containing vaccines (TCVs) and autism, and studies done after the removal of thiomersal from vaccines have nevertheless shown autism rates continuing to increase. The only epidemiologic research that has found a purported link between TCVs and autism has been conducted by Mark Geier, whose flawed research has not been given any weight by independent reviews.|$|E
5|$|Plesiorycteropus, {{also known}} as the bibymalagasy or Malagasy aardvark, is a {{recently}} extinct eutherian mammalian genus from Madagascar. Upon its description in 1895, it was classified with the aardvark, but more recent <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> little evidence to link it to aardvarks or any other order of mammals. Molecular evidence instead suggests that it is related to the tenrecs. Two species are currently recognized, the larger P.madagascariensis and the smaller P.germainepetterae. They probably overlapped in distribution, as subfossil remains of both species have been found in the same site.|$|E

5|$|Some <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> {{that deep}} frying in olive and {{sunflower}} oils {{has been found}} to be less of a detriment to health and in some cases have positive effects on insulin levels. Oil can be reused a few times after original use after straining out solids. However, excessive use of the same oil can cause it to break down and release compounds into the food that may be carcinogenic, affect liver health, or influence the body's ability to absorb vitamins. Some European countries have set public health standards for the safety of frying oil.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} season is {{during the summer}} rainy season (mainly June to August in India) but can vary. Laboratory <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> that long day illumination and high humidity trigger gonadal growth. The song of the male is very soft but complex and variable, audible only at close range. This song described as a jingle consists {{of a series of}} high notes followed by a croaky rattle and ending in a slurred whistle. When singing the male sits in what is called the slope posture—erect with the head feathers raised.|$|E
5|$|The {{evidence}} on the convergence of prices in the eurozone {{with the introduction of}} the euro is mixed. Several studies failed to find any evidence of convergence following the introduction of the euro after a phase of convergence in the early 1990s. Other <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> evidence of price convergence, in particular for cars. A possible reason for the divergence between the different studies is that the processes of convergence may not have been linear, slowing down substantially between 2000 and 2003, and resurfacing after 2003 as suggested by a recent study (2009).|$|E

5|$|Earwigs {{are among}} the few non-social insect species that show {{maternal}} care. The mother will {{pay close attention to}} the needs of her eggs, such as warmth and protection, though {{studies have shown that the}} mother does not pay attention to the eggs as she collects them. The mother has been shown to pick up wax balls by accident, but they would eventually be rejected as they do not have the proper scent. The mother will also faithfully defend the eggs from predators, not leaving them to eat unless the clutch goes bad. Another distinct maternal care unique to earwigs is that the mother continuously cleans the eggs to protect them from fungi. <b>Studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> that the urge to clean the eggs persists for days after they are removed; when the eggs were replaced after hatching, the mother continued to clean them for up to 3 months.|$|E
5|$|In humans, sodium is an {{essential}} mineral that regulates blood volume, blood pressure, osmotic equilibrium and pH; the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is 500 milligrams per day. Sodium chloride is the principal source of sodium in the diet, and is used as seasoning and preservative in such commodities as pickled preserves and jerky; for Americans, most sodium chloride comes from processed foods. Other sources of sodium are its natural occurrence in food and such food additives as monosodium glutamate (MSG), sodium nitrite, sodium saccharin, baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), and sodium benzoate. The US Institute of Medicine set its Tolerable Upper Intake Level for sodium at 2.3grams per day, but the average person in the United States consumes 3.4grams per day. <b>Studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> that lowering sodium intake by 2g per day tends to lower systolic blood pressure by about two to four mmHg. It {{has been estimated that}} such a decrease in sodium intake would lead to between 9 and 17% fewer cases of hypertension.|$|E
5|$|Infants and {{patients}} fed via a gastrostomy tube {{can also be}} given a ketogenic diet. Parents make up a prescribed powdered formula, such as KetoCal, into a liquid feed. Gastrostomy feeding avoids any issues with palatability, and bottle-fed infants readily accept the ketogenic formula. Some <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> this liquid feed to be more efficacious and associated with lower total cholesterol than a solid ketogenic diet. KetoCal is a nutritionally complete food containing milk protein and is supplemented with amino acids, fat, carbohydrate, vitamins, minerals and trace elements. It is used to administer the 4:1 ratio classic ketogenic diet in children over one year. The formula is available in both 3:1 and 4:1 ratios, either unflavoured or in an artificially sweetened vanilla flavour and is suitable for tube or oral feeding. Other formula products include KetoVolve and Ketonia. Alternatively, a liquid ketogenic diet may be produced by combining Ross Carbohydrate Free soy formula with Microlipid and Polycose.|$|E
