5|$|During {{the regular}} season, games were {{played on a}} Friday night and a doubleheader on Saturday; in each doubleheader {{one of the two}} games was {{shortened}} to seven innings. The exception to this was when Perth played their home games; they played on a Thursday night instead of a doubleheader on Saturday. Each postseason series was scheduled for a Friday, <b>Saturday</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sunday.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hurn Bridge is {{also the}} home of Christchurch Cricket Club who have teams in the <b>Saturday</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sunday</b> Dorset Leagues.

Hurn Bridge houses the Dorset Cricket Centre, an indoor training facility run by the Dorset Cricket Board.|$|E
5|$|In October 2013, NFL {{commissioner}} Roger Goodell {{announced plans}} to revisit the idea to expand the playoffs to 14 teams, with the increased revenue gained from the two additional postseason games being used to offset plans to shorten the preseason. The two extra Wild Card games could also be scheduled on the weekend, creating triple-headers on both <b>Saturday</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sunday.</b> Goodell then suggested that they might instead be played on Friday and/or Monday, which may eventually cause scheduling conflicts with games of the new College Football Playoff.|$|E

5|$|Playing {{to small}} audiences, on tiny stages, in {{communal}} troupes where {{all but the}} stars had day jobs, and playing only <b>Saturday</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sunday</b> (the pious London Jews would never have tolerated Friday performances), Adler focused on serious theater like never before. However, he and Grodner soon fell out: they wrangled over ideology and over parts, and their verbal duels boiled over into improvised stage dialogue. The Grodners ultimately left to do theater {{in a series of}} other locations, notably Paris, but eventually came back to London, where Israel Grodner died in 1887.|$|E

5|$|Several {{times between}} 1978–89, the two wild-card games {{had to be}} played on {{different}} days. Normally they both would be held on Sunday. In 1983 and 1988, the games were split between Saturday and Monday because Sunday was Christmas, and the NFL had avoided playing on that day at the time. In 1984, both games were played in the Pacific Time Zone, {{so they had to}} be played on <b>Saturday</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sunday</b> to accommodate for time differences. In 1985, both the New York Giants and Jets hosted wild-card games. As they have shared a home stadium since 1984, the games had to be played on different days.|$|E

5|$|The club {{had a small}} bar, library, large {{dining and}} dance floor, billiards table, ping pong table and a two-lane bowling alley, and was the centre of social life on the island for the {{employees}} of the penitentiary. It regularly hosted dinners, bingo events, and from the 1940s onwards showed movies every Sunday night after they had been shown to the inmates during the day on <b>Saturday</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sunday.</b> The club was responsible for organizing numerous special events on the island (held either in the hall or the Parade Grounds) and the fundraising associated with it, anything from ice cream and watermelon feasts to Halloween fancy dress and Christmas parties.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} inaugural {{run of the}} RTLs {{took place}} on September 18–19, 1976. Regular service on the Empire Corridor began on September 20. Initially, the two trainsets were mostly confined to the New York–Albany shuttle, with a single round-trip each on <b>Saturday</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sunday</b> to Buffalo. The New York–Montreal Adirondack received Turboliners on March 1, 1977, replacing conventional equipment. By April 1977, Turboliners had displaced conventional equipment on most routes in upstate New York. Exceptions included some New York–Albany trains, {{as well as the}} long-distance Lake Shore Limited and Niagara Rainbow. In 1989, after 12 years of operation, the availability of the fleet was at 90%.|$|E
5|$|A {{few weeks}} before the 2015 festival Foo Fighters {{frontman}} Dave Grohl fell off a stage during a show in Gothenburg and broke his leg, forcing their late withdrawal from the line-up. Florence and the Machine were moved from second-top on the bill to Friday's headliner, while Florence's vacant gap was filled by Reading & Leeds headliners The Libertines, and their performance was well received. Kanye West and The Who were the headliners for the <b>Saturday</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sunday,</b> respectively. Other notable acts who performed included Motörhead (their final festival appearance in the UK before Lemmy's death), Pharrell Williams, Deadmau5, Patti Smith, the Strypes, Lionel Richie, Catfish and the Bottlemen, Enter Shikari, the Chemical Brothers, Thee Faction, Alt-J, Paloma Faith, Mary J.

5|$|Every year Reading {{hosts the}} Reading Festival, {{which has been}} running since 1971. The festival takes place on the Friday, <b>Saturday</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sunday</b> of the August bank holiday weekend and is the largest {{of its kind in}} the UK aside from the Glastonbury Festival. For some twenty years until 2006, Reading was also known for its WOMAD Festival until it moved to Charlton Park in Malmesbury, Wiltshire. The Reading Beer Festival was first held in 1994 and has now grown to one of the largest beer festivals in the UK. It is held at King's Meadow for the five days {{immediately}} preceding the May Day bank holiday every year. Reading also holds Reading Pride, an annual LGBTA festival in Kings Meadow.|$|E
5|$|KWGN and KPLR moved The CW's primetime lineup {{one hour}} later (to 8:00 p.m.) than the network-recommended timeslot, and shifted their evening newscasts to 7:00 p.m. (weekend {{editions of the}} evening newscasts were {{discontinued}} with the move; KPLR has since expanded its 7:00 p.m. newscast to <b>Saturday</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sunday</b> evenings) to avoid competing with KDVR and KTVI's 9:00 p.m. newscasts; KWGN retained its weekday morning newscast (which competes directly with KDVR's morning newscast), but canceled its 5:30 p.m. – and later, 11:00 a.m. – newscasts. In contrast, KPLR (which had run a primetime newscast for much of its history) eventually added hour-long midday and late afternoon newscasts. The two LMA arrangements became legal duopolies in December 2013, once Tribune finalized its acquisition of Local TV.|$|E
5|$|On 11–12 August 2012, the <b>Saturday</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sunday</b> {{prior to}} {{the launch of the}} second series of Red or Black?, ITV {{suffered}} the worst weekend in its 57-year history due to BBC One's coverage of the 2012 Summer Olympics; it was beaten to second place in the primetime league tables by BBC Three {{for the first time ever}} and the only ITV programme on 11 August that was one of the channel's 30 most watched in the week 6–12 August 2012 was the ITV News at Ten. The Olympics closing ceremony the following night gave BBC One more than 20 times the audience share of ITV. While the lead was nowhere near as large on the remainder of the evenings, BBC One still beat ITV every night on the overall primetime audience share, except for Thursday night.|$|E

Travel time from Østerås to Majorstuen is 16 minutes, to Stortinget is 20 minutes, and to Vestli on the Grorud Line is 50 minutes. The metro and the line are owned by Kollektivtransportproduksjon and operated by Oslo T-banedrift on contract with Ruter.|$|E
5|$|On August 15, the Egyptians {{launched}} an offensive from their major north-western base in Haradh. They had 1,000 troops and about 2,000 republicans. The plan, as interpreted by British intelligence, {{seemed to have}} been to cut the thirty-mile track southward through the mountains from the Saudi border at Khoubah to al-Badr's headquarters in the Qara mountains near Washa, and then to split into two task forces, one moving east through Washa to the headquarters and the other north-eastwards along the track to the Saudi border below the Razih mountains. The Egyptians began their move on Saturday morning, moving along the Haradh and Tashar ravines. On <b>Saturday</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sunday</b> afternoons they were caught in heavy rain and their vehicles, including twenty tanks and about forty armored cars sank axle deep into the mud. The defenders left them alone until Monday at dawn. Al-Badr left his headquarters at three that morning with 1,000 men to direct a counterattack in the Tashar ravine, while Abdullah Hussein attacked in the Haradh ravine.|$|E
5|$|The BBC's {{highlights}} {{package on}} <b>Saturday</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sunday</b> nights, {{as well as}} other evenings when fixtures justify, will run until 2016. Television rights alone for the period 2010 to 2013 have been purchased for £1.782billion. On 22 June 2009, due to troubles encountered by Setanta Sports after it failed to meet a final deadline over a £30million payment to the Premier League, ESPN was awarded two packages of UK rights containing a total of 46 matches that were available for the 2009–10 season as well as a package of 23 matches per season from 2010–11 to 2012–13. On 13 June 2012, the Premier League announced that BT had been awarded 38 games a season for the 2013–14 through 2015–16 seasons at £246million-a-year. The remaining 116 games were retained by Sky who paid £760million-a-year. The total domestic rights have raised £3.018billion, an increase of 70.2% over the 2010–11 to 2012–13 rights. The value of the licensing deal rose by another 70.2% in 2015, when Sky and BT paid a total of £5.136billion to renew their contracts with the Premier League for another three years up to the 2018–19 season.|$|E
