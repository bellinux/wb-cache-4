The [...] engine gives the aircraft a sea level, standard day takeoff distance of 150 ft and a landing distance of 300 ft.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the general trade-off, another important factor is standardization. Once a standard has been chosen, and equipment, infrastructure, and training calibrated to that <b>standard,</b> <b>conversion</b> becomes difficult and expensive. This also {{makes it easier to}} adopt an existing standard than to invent a new one. This is true of many technologies, including railroad gauges. For rail gauge in particular, break-of-gauge often causes inefficiency far in excess of the merits of any particular gauge. The reduced cost, greater efficiency, and greater economic opportunity offered by the use of a common standard explains why a small number of gauges predominate worldwide.|$|E
5000|$|From late 1963, the {{regional}} programmes were also broadcast on La deuxième chaîne by using optical <b>standard</b> <b>conversion</b> in {{the regional}} centres (a 625 lines camera aimed at an 819 lines monitor with a special CRT) {{in order to better}} adapt the regional coverage to the new [...] "regions" [...] created in France, and they remained even after the opening of La troisième chaîne (The Third Channel) under the ORTF on 31 December 1972, all three networks broadcasting the regional news, sometimes from two or even three different production centres (e.g. Niort broadcasting Poitiers on networks 1 and 3, and Nantes on network 2).|$|E

5000|$|... 1. Travel Van/Family Van- These are the <b>standard</b> <b>conversion</b> {{vans and}} the only ones offered with low tops as well as high tops. A typical travel van will {{accommodate}} seven passengers on one rear bench, and four captain's chairs. Often, the rear bench electronically folds flat into a bed. These vans normally have large windows with shades, storage cabinets, and a TV. Originally, TVs were small DC conversion models with antennas. These TVs were bulky (especially in low tops where {{they had to be}} mounted on the floor) and not very useful due to poor signal. In the '80s, VCRs and later DVD players were added greatly improving the usefulness of the TV. Finally, flat screen monitors have eliminated the need for special cabinetry to hold the TV. High-end stereo systems and other electronics have become typical. Most accommodate multiple game systems.|$|E
5000|$|It {{should be}} noted that the {{definition}} as written does not define the power of the motor in Watts as is conventionally done for electric bicycles but rather in brake horsepower. Thus for an electric bicycle, motor kit, or electric bicycle motor that is not rated by the manufacture in brake horsepower but rather in Watts a conversion must be made in the units a conversion which is not given in the code of the law and thus the court will have to consider a factor of conversion that is not directly encoded in the law. Industry <b>standard</b> <b>conversion</b> for Watts to horsepower for electric motors is 1 horsepower = 746 watts. [...] Acceptance of that conversion factor from industry, however, as interpretation of the law is subject to the process of the courts since it is not defined specifically in the law.|$|E

5000|$|The 220 yard Low Hurdles {{is one of}} {{the four}} events Jesse Owens set or tied World Records in during a 45 minute span on May 25, 1935—what many people have {{regarded}} as the greatest sports achievement. The previous mark of 22.5 was held by Karl Martin Lauer, the German Olympic hurdler, over the metric distance. As were all marks from that era, it was recorded by three hand stopwatches, as opposed to today's Fully Automatic Timing (FAT). The fastest FAT time recorded is now 22.30 (with a wind of -0.6 mps) set on May 16, 2010 by Andy Turner set at the Manchester City Games in a specially arranged race, but using <b>standard</b> <b>conversion,</b> Styron's mark is still superior. Turner beat a time by Olympian Laurent Ottoz of Italy in 1995. Ottoz had bettered the automatic time of 22.63 by British Olympic medalist and multi-time World Champion Colin Jackson, who held the world record in the much more common 110 metre hurdles for almost 13 years.|$|E
50|$|The Guyanese dollar (currency sign: $, G$ and GY$; ISO: GYD) {{has been}} the unit of account in Guyana (formerly British Guiana) since 29 January 1839. Originally it was {{intended}} as a transitional unit to facilitate the changeover from the Dutch guilder system of currency to the British pound sterling system. The Spanish dollar was already prevalent throughout the West Indies in general, and from 1839, the Spanish dollar unit operated in British Guiana in conjunction with British sterling coins at a <b>standard</b> <b>conversion</b> rate of one dollar for every four shillings and twopence. In 1951 the British sterling coinage was replaced with a new decimal coinage which was simultaneously introduced through all the British territories in the Eastern Caribbean. When sterling began to depreciate in the early 1970s, a switch to a US dollar peg became increasingly attractive as an anti-inflationary measure and the Eastern Caribbean Currency Authority (of which Guyana was a member) made the switch in October 1975. The Guyanese dollar is normally abbreviated with the dollar sign $, or alternatively G$ to distinguish it from other dollar-denominated currencies.|$|E
5000|$|The last {{official}} {{world record}} holder {{in the event}} was Don Styron from Northeast Louisiana State University, whose 21.9 hand timed mark was set on April 2, 1960, in a dual meet against Louisiana State University. The mark has lasted ever since. Modern races use Fully Automatic Timing (FAT). The fastest FAT time recorded is now 22.30 (with a wind of -0.6 mps) set on May 16, 2010 by Andy Turner set at the Manchester City Games in a specially arranged race, but using <b>standard</b> <b>conversion,</b> Styron's mark is still superior.

50|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{companies}} manufacture ketone screening strips. A strip consists of a thin piece of plastic film slightly larger than a matchstick, with a reagent pad on one end that is either dipped into a urine sample or passed through the stream while the user is voiding. The pad is allowed to react for an exact, specified amount of time (it is recommended to use a stopwatch to time this exactly and disregard any resultant colour change after the specified time); its resulting colour is then compared to a graded shade chart indicating a detection range from negative presence of ketones up to a significant quantity. It {{is worth noting that}} in severe diabetic ketoacidosis, the dipstix reaction based on sodium nitroprusside may underestimate the level of ketone bodies in the blood. It is sensitive to acetoacetate only, and the ratio of beta-hydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate is shifted from a normal value of around 1:1 up to around 10:1 under severely ketoacetotic conditions, due to a changing redox milieu in the liver. Measuring acetoacetate alone will thus underestimate the accompanying beta-hydroxybutyrate if the <b>standard</b> <b>conversion</b> factor is applied.|$|E
5000|$|A {{review by}} Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly called it [...] "a {{harrowing}} nail-biter of a movie". Ella Taylor of NPR wrote In Darkness [...] "satisfies for {{the intensity of}} the performances and for the artful contrasting of life on the teeming streets of L'viv with life and death in the dim, rat-infested sewers", adding that it [...] "is often a thrilling adventure picture — as if Anne Frank had found an Inglourious Basterd to help her make The Great Escape". Ty Burr of The Boston Globe called the film [...] "a harrowing Holocaust tale, but one that speaks to humankind's capacity to endure, to fight on in the face of terrible cruelty", adding that Holland [...] "elicits taut performances from a strong cast". David Denby of The New Yorker called it [...] "the most volatile that Holland has directed. With a distinguished, hardworking cast of German and Polish actors", noting that [...] "honesty is the movie's greatest strength". Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter said this [...] "harrowing, engrossing, claustrophobic and sometimes literally hard to watch … robust, arduous drama is more ironic and multi-faceted than most such tales and should be well received by the considerable art house audience worldwide partial to the subject matter". Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal said this [...] "brave epic" [...] film's [...] "suspense, derived from a true story, is excruciating and inspiring in equal measure". A. O. Scott of The New York Times called In Darkness [...] "suspenseful, horrifying and at times intensely moving … touching, warm and dramatically satisfying". On the other hand, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times dismissed the film as redundant and inferior to Schindler's List which was [...] "more entertaining" [...] in his view. Michael Atkinson of the Village Voice claimed that [...] "Holland does skirt the ethical entrapment of Schindler's List (over-lionizing the Aryan rescuer)", adding: [...] "It's not fair, but there it is: We've been here before." [...] The German authorities in occupied Poland referred to non-Jews, including Poles, as Aryans; colloquially, documents proving one's non-Jewish identity were called [...] "Aryan papers", and the areas prohibited to Jews were known collectively as [...] "the Aryan side". the Polish districts of citi David Edelstein of New York Magazine wrote: [...] "In outline, In Darkness is a <b>standard</b> <b>conversion</b> melodrama, but little within those parameters is easy. The darkness lingers into the light." [...] Mick LaSalle of San Francisco Chronicle called it [...] "an extraordinary movie, and somehow good art … a gripping piece of history and also an exploration into the mysteries of the human soul", and gave it [...] "the highest recommendation".|$|E
