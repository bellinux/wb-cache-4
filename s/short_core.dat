5000|$|... {{percussion}} sidewall coring uses robust cylindrical [...] "bullets" [...] explosively propelled {{into the}} wall of a borehole to retrieve a (relatively) small, <b>short</b> <b>core</b> sample. These tend to be heavily shattered, rendering porosity/ permeability measurements dubious, but are often sufficient for lithological and micropalaeontological study. Many samples can be attempted in a single run of the tools, which are typically configured with 20 to 30 [...] "bullets" [...] and propulsive charges along the length of a tool. Several tools can often be ganged together for a single run. The success rates for firing a particular bullet, it penetrating the borehole wall, the retention system recovering the bullet from the borehole wall, and the sample being retained in the bullet are all relatively low, so {{it is not uncommon for}} only half the samples attempted to be successful. This is an important consideration in planning sample programmes.|$|E

40|$|Jet efflux {{characteristics}} are a determining factor in STOVL aircraft aero/propulsion induced effects. Subcritical jets may have core lengths which range up to 6 diameters. The <b>shorter</b> <b>core</b> length jets tend to entrain ambient air more rapidly, inducing larger hover lift losses, and decay more rapidly, reducing adverse ground erosion. In transition flight, <b>shorter</b> <b>core</b> length jets show a larger {{decrease in the}} lift loss and a slight decrease in nose-up pitching moment. Supercritical pressure ratio jets tend to have longer, higher pressure core lengths with a greater hazard for ground erosion. The decay in the fully developed region is similar for both subcritical and supercritical pressure ratio jets. For subsonic jets the decay is inversely proportional to {{the distance from the}} jet exit. In ground effect the supercritical jet induces an oscillating pressure distribution on the ground with reflected shocks and expansions which can increase ground erosion and, at low ground heights, cause non-monotonic lift loss variations...|$|R

40|$|An {{approach}} combining petrology {{and statistics}} (cluster analysis) is developed to better distinguish {{a series of}} subfacies in surficial and <b>short</b> <b>core</b> samples from Idku lagoon in the northwestern Nile delta, Egypt. The method integrates lithology, physical and biogenic structures, grain size, and composition of the sand-size fraction. Seven lithofacies, eight grain-size types and six clusters reveal comparable geographic distributions that are a direct response to geomorphic setting and depositional processes, {{both of which have}} been modified by man. Although positioned in an arid setting and affected by anthropogenic factors (land reclamation, pollutants), regional subfacies distribution patterns in Idku lagoon are largely a function of the spatial configuration of freshwater-dominated to brackish to higher salinity-dominated (near inlet) zones typical of lagoons receiving significant freshwater input. Within Idku, a northern depositional province near the inlet and along the coastal sand barrier is defined by associations of terrigenous and coarse-grained sediment types. A southern province, bounded by lagoon margins and marshes, is characterized by finer-grained sediment types, with a high biogenic content, recording lower energy levels. The petrological-statistical approach is used to identify and interpret lagoon subfacies in older (to > 6000 years B. P.) core sections in ldku region and in former Abu Qir lagoon. Additionally, cluster analysis serves to determine specific lagoon subfacies from hand samples alone, whether from surface grabs or cores; this is based on a comparison of lithofacies and clusters determined for surficial and <b>short</b> <b>core</b> samples in the ldku region. To test the method, a separate cluster analysis, also using surficial and <b>short</b> <b>core</b> samples, was used to define Manzala lagoon subfacies in the northeastern Nile delta. Results are generally comparable to those obtained in the ldku study, and show a close relation among Manzala lagoon subfacies, geomorphic configuration and depositional processes. The petrological-statistical method could be applied to other regions, and also to the geological record...|$|E

40|$|Experiments to {{characterize}} runoff and drainage from large undisturbed soil cores {{obtained from a}} site under volunteer pasture are presented. The objectives were to evaluate if a simple kinematic wave model could be used {{to characterize}} drainage under conditions of by-passing flow and to investigate the variability of runoff generation under wet and dry antecedent conditions in this well structured soil. Cores were taken to depths of 0. 4 and 0. 7 m, with six cores obtained from each depth. Results show that variations in soil structure between cores have a greater influence on the hydrologic response than variations in antecedent water content. It may be inferred that, in this soil, good structural continuity substantially enhances soil drainage and, in consequence, decreases surface runoff. During wetting, kinematic celerities ranged from 337 to 3200 mm h- 1 in the <b>short</b> <b>cores</b> and from 357 to 1400 mm h- 1 in the long cores. The corresponding estimated ranges of mobile or 'macropore' fractions were from 0. 015 to 0. 154 m 3 m- 3 in the <b>short</b> <b>cores</b> and 0. 033 to 0. 132 m 3 m- 3 in the long cores.

30|$|Four sets of {{relative}} permeability experiments {{were conducted to}} obtain reliable data for CO 2 flooding. Since distances are required {{for the development of}} dynamic miscibility and existence difficulties to conduct a long real core flooding due to low permeability, long experiment time and severe sleeve corrosion, two experiments were conducted in slim tubes to study the effect of core length on miscible process and displacement efficiency. Then based on natural cores and reservoir fluid of Jilin oil field, long composite core and <b>short</b> <b>core</b> segument experiments of CO 2 flooding were preformed above MMP in the presence of irreducible water saturation to study CO 2 –oil relative permeability in natural cores.|$|E
30|$|Obviously, {{with new}} data {{processing}} method and long composite cores, the relative permeability curves for CO 2 flooding obtained {{in this paper}} are more reliable. Firstly, combined with improved Corey model and history-matching method effects of capillary pressure and vaporizing mechanism can be incorporated in relative permeability curves. Secondly, <b>short</b> <b>core</b> segment failed to simulate mass transfer mechanism due to early gas breakthrough and more oil remained in pores. Thirdly, longer contacting time between CO 2 and oil strengthens the vaporizing and dissolution mechanism which helps to decrease oil viscosity and IFT. However, it is should be noticed, long composite cores and new data processing method in this paper improved CO 2 –oil relative permeability curves obtained in laboratory, {{but it is still}} failed to simulate the fully miscible flooding in natural cores.|$|E

Analyses of Mn, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn {{were carried}} out in a <b>short</b> <b>core</b> from a salt marsh of the Nador Lagoon (north-eastem Morocco) and in {{surficial}} sediment samples collected in the Martil river, which borders the industrial town of Tétouan. Three soit samples and a reservoir sediment were also collected around the town to check the effects of atmospheric delivery of contaminants. 'Cs and 2 lOPb activity-depth profïles were used to establish a chronology for the core, obtaining an apparent accumulation rate of 0. 41 cm il. The concentrations of anthropogenic metals in this marsh sediment are low and probably represent natural backgrounds. A recent decrease can be an effect of changing grain size. Thé Mardi River sediments are slightly contaminated by Cu and Pb, whereas the soil samples present anomalous values of Cd and Zn. 1...|$|E

Meadow pools with peaty, dystrophic waters mainly contained valves of Ilyocypris cf. bradyi and/or Ilyocypris lacustris and Eucypris sp. whereas the latter was replaced by Heterocypris incongruens in a shallow oxbow pool. Candona rawsoni, Cyclocypris ovum and Ilyocypris echinata were the most frequent species in the freshwater Lake Luanhaizi.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Synthetic {{promoters}} {{are commonly}} used tools for circuit design or high level protein production. Promoter engineer-ing efforts in yeasts, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris have mostly been focused on altering upstream regulatory sequences such as transcription factor binding sites. In higher eukaryotes synthetic core promoters, directly needed for tran-scription initiation by RNA Polymerase II, have been successfully designed. Here we report the first synthetic yeast core promoter for P. pastoris, based on natural yeast core promoters. Furthermore we used this synthetic core promoter sequence to engineer the core promoter of the natural AOX 1 promoter, thereby creating a set of core promoters providing a range of different expression levels. As opposed to engineering strategies of the significantly longer entire promoter, such <b>short</b> <b>core</b> promoters can directly be added on a PCR primer facilitating library generation and are sufficient to obtain variable expression yields...|$|E

40|$|The spatial {{reconstruction}} of the XY pair of chromosomes from human spermatocytes has {{been made by the}} study of serial sections 1000 A in thickness. The sex pair during zygotene-pachytene forms a condensed mass of chromatin that has two filamentous, electron-opaque cores: the long and the <b>short</b> <b>core.</b> During early pachytene both cores have a common ending region, about 0. 4 – 0. 8 µ long. This common end is a synaptonemal complex, and each of the cores forms a lateral element of that complex. The cores become more convoluted during middle pachytene forming "ringlike bodies. " Nucleoli from spermatocytes have three distinct regions: (a) granular; (b) dense fibrillar; and (c) clear intermediate. Occasional association of the XY pair and the heteropycnotic "basal knobs" results in apparent association of nucleoli and the sex pair in a minority of cells.

GBV-C RNA was detected in the culture by reverse transcription-PCR for more than 130 days after inoculation, while it was detected for 44 days but not later in the parental IFN-sensitive Daudi cells. Productive infection of GBV-C in the H- 903 system was confirmed by serially inoculating supernatants from infected cultures into uninfected cells. The viral E 2 antigen was detected by immunofluorescence in the cells inoculated with the fifth passage of GBV-C.

30|$|When sea-bottom {{sampling}} is conducted, {{an appropriate}} corer is selected considering {{the purpose of}} the sampling. A piston corer can recover a relatively longer sequence of sediments than that collected by a gravity corer. This leads to a negative pressure produced by the piston, which makes it easier for sediments to enter tubes. However, upward acceleration of the piston disturbs the sediment texture and structure. When the motion of a piston is slower than the penetration of the corer {{at the beginning of the}} penetration, the uppermost part of the sediment column is missed and/or <b>shorter</b> <b>core</b> recovery than penetration occurs.

By contrast the stratigraphic record of P accumulation provided very weak signals of the historical nutrient enrichment in the water column.
