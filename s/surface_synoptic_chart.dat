50|$|The folios {{grew out}} of Todd’s desire to inform the colonists of South Australia of the immense size of weather systems and that in {{southern}} Australia, they generally progressed from west to east and not {{from east to west}} as commonly assumed by the early colonists. To accomplish this, Todd displayed daily the last 6 <b>synoptic</b> <b>charts</b> for public viewing then bound and stored them in the folios.The Todd weather folios consist not only of <b>synoptic</b> <b>charts,</b> but also include clippings from newspapers detailing weather statistics and events for all the eastern colonies of Australia.

50|$|With {{the advent}} of the {{telegraph}} it was possible to simultaneously collect data, such as surface temperature and sea-level pressure, to draw <b>synoptic</b> weather <b>charts.</b> With Charles Todd's appointment as Postmaster General to the Colony, he trained not only his telegraph operators, but also his postmasters as weather observers. These observers provided valuable data points that, in combination with telegraphed observations from the other colonies (including New Zealand), showed the development and progress of weather activity across {{a large part of the}} Southern Hemisphere. Todd's best known feat was his construction management of the Overland Telegraph from Adelaide to Port Darwin. This line of communication was critical to his capacity to create continent-wide <b>synoptic</b> <b>charts</b> as the telegraphic observations from the Outback enabled the connection of data points on the east coast of Australia with similar data points on the west and southern coasts. These continent-scale isobaric lines allowed Todd and his staff to draw <b>synoptic</b> <b>charts</b> that in the early 1880s had a greater breadth than any (known) <b>synoptic</b> <b>charts</b> drawn elsewhere in the world.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{critical}} question {{related to a}} possible secular trend in the Sun’s total magnetic flux and consequently in solar irradiance is {{the total amount of}} magnetic flux present on the Sun and how it is distributed between active regions and the quiet Sun. NSO/Kitt Peak <b>synoptic</b> <b>charts</b> have in the past been used to estimate the total flux and the fraction of the flux in active regions and in the quiet Sun. Since a single pixel of these <b>synoptic</b> <b>charts</b> is much bigger than individual small-scale magnetic elements and opposite polarities may be present within the same pixel, some magnetic flux escaped notice. Here we estimate the fraction of the magnetic flux escaping detection in Kitt Peak <b>synoptic</b> <b>charts.</b> By artificially reducing the spatial resolution of MDI full-disc and high-resolution magnetograms we study the influence of the resolution on the measured total magnetic flux. Noise in the data poses the main difficulty to this approach and is carefully studied. It is concluded that {{at least half of the}} magnetic flux in the quiet Sun remains undetected in Kitt Peak <b>synoptic</b> <b>charts</b> and that the total flux present on the solar surface at maxima of activity is around twice the flux present at activity minima...|$|R

40|$|The <b>synoptic</b> <b>chart</b> encodes climatological and {{meteorological}} {{information in a}} highly abstract manner. The pupil's level of cognitive development, {{the nature of the}} syllabus and the teaching strategies employed by the geography teacher influence the pupil's conceptualisation of information. The <b>synoptic</b> <b>chart</b> is a valuable tool for consolidating the content of the S. A climatology syllabus. Recent research has established that climatology-meteorology, and especially <b>synoptic</b> <b>chart</b> reading and interpretation, is difficult for the concrete thinker. These pupils find difficulty in visualising the weather processes and systems. Provided that they are simple and clear, models are useful teaching devices that integrate and generalise information {{in a manner that is}} easily retrievable. The intention of the author is to provide weather type models and other supporting strategies and aids as a means to improve the senior secondary pupil's assimilation of southern African climatological-{{meteorological information}}. This model-based approach is tested in the classroom using an action research framework to judge its efficacy. Conclusions are drawn and recommendations are made. ...|$|R

40|$|Magnetic flux <b>synoptic</b> <b>charts</b> are {{critical}} for reliable modeling of the corona and heliosphere. Until now, however, these charts were provided without any estimate of uncertainties. The uncertainties are due to instrumental noise in the measurements and to the spatial variance of the magnetic flux distribution that contributes to each bin in the <b>synoptic</b> <b>chart.</b> We describe here a simple method to compute synoptic magnetic flux maps and their corresponding magnetic flux spatial variance charts {{that can be used}} to estimate the uncertainty in the results of coronal models. We have tested this approach by computing a potential-field-source-surface model of the coronal field for a Monte Carlo simulation of Carrington synoptic magnetic flux maps generated from the variance map.

40|$|A poorly {{consolidated}} concept base creates considerable difficulty amongst adolescents when {{it comes}} to the higher order task of analyzing complex, abstract and scientific weather phenomena as they appear on <b>synoptic</b> <b>charts.</b> The nature of the difficulties which they experience tends to encourage them to resort to the rote memorisation of concepts rather than understanding them. Kuhn (1962) avers that concepts, not enquiry methods, are at the core of rational thought. A well taught concept becomes a well developed mental construct which encourages understanding. It is the author's firm belief that in order for pupils to come to a thorough understanding of senior secondary meteorology - climatology and the <b>synoptic</b> <b>chart,</b> teaching of basic concepts should be graded and sequential. This thesis attempts to show the difficulties inherent in synoptic climatology. It relates these difficulties to adolescent cognitive development.

40|$|Meterwave maps of {{the solar}} corona made with the Clark Lake Radioheliograph at 30. 9, 50, and 73. 8 MHz for one solar {{rotation}} are presented. They are compared and contrasted with optical data: 10, 830 A maps, white-light coronagraph images (SOLWIND and Mauna Loa K coronameter), and forbidden line scans. Most of the sources in the radio maps persist for two days or more, and appear to rotate approximately with the solar rate. A coronal hole seen against the disk at all three frequencies shows interesting similarities and significant differences with the optical signatures of the hole.
