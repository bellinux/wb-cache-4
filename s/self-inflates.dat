40|$|Juvenal's third satire is {{a privileged}} piece of verbal diarrhoea. As the longest satire in Juvenal's well-attended Book 1, as {{the centre of}} this book, and as the one Juvenalian jewel that sparkles ‘non-rhetorically’, {{it has always been}} the critics’ darling. Its protagonist, on the other hand, has not always been so popular. Recently, reader sympathy for old Umbricius (the poem's main speaker) has shifted to {{laughter}} in his face; the old sense of ‘pathetic’ has ceded to the new. One of the central strategies of the ‘Umbricius-as-caricature’ camp has been to point to the overtime worked by ‘mock-epic’ in this poem: Umbricius <b>self-inflates</b> to become another Aeneas, fleeing a crumbling Troy (Rome). But an oppositio is wedged in imitando. Umbricius makes his lengthy verbal preparations to depart from Rome for Cumae; Aeneas had come to Rome through Cumae. Umbricius withdraws to set up shop in the meagre countryside; Aeneas had escaped to cap his exile teleologically with the (pre-foundation of the) Greatest City That Will Ever Be. Still, Virgil's paradigm tale of displacement, drift and re-establishment underlies Umbricius' self-definition as an exile. Indeed exile, with a large and ever-increasing stock of mythical and historical examples, was a situation ripe for self-mythologizing. Umbricius stands in Aeneas' shadow then, standing it on its head. His recession also makes him into a Iustitia/Dikē figure, the final trace of the golden age, off to alloy himself elsewhere. In his mind, exile is rationalized by distinguished past examples; in ours, we laugh at how disparate example and man really are. That side of Umbricius has been done to death; or at least, for present purposes, to exile. PostprintPeer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although <b>self-inflating</b> {{bags are}} widely used for manual hyperinflation, they do not allow {{ventilation}} parameters, such as pressure or volume, to be set. We studied the ventilation performance of neonatal and pediatric <b>self-inflating</b> bags. METHODS: We asked 22 physiothera-pists to manually hyperinflate 2 lung models (neonatal and pediatric), using <b>self-inflating</b> bags from 3 manufactures (Hudson, Laerdal, and JG Moriya), with flows of 0, 5, 10, and 15 L/min. A pneumotachograph recorded tidal volume (VT), peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), peak inspiratory flow (PIF), peak expiratory flow (PEF), and inspiratory time. RESULTS: The VT, PIP, and in-spiratory time delivered by the Hudson, Laerdal, and JG Moriya bags, in both neonatal and pediatric <b>self-inflating</b> bags, were significantly different (P <. 001). The PEF and PIF delivered were different only when using the neonatal <b>self-inflating</b> bags (P <. 001). The VT, PIP, and PIF delivered with a flow of 0 L/min were lower than with 15 L/min (P <. 05) with all the tested bags, in both the neonatal and pediatric sizes. CONCLUSIONS: The performance of the tested neonatal and pediatric bags varied by manufacturer and oxygen flow. There {{was an increase in}} VT, PIP, and PIF related to the increase of oxygen flow from 0 L/min to 15 L/min.

40|$|Intermittent {{positive}} pressure ventilation (IPPV) using {{a manual}} ventilation device {{is one of}} the most commonly performed interventions in neonatal medicine. Applied peak inspiratory pressures (PIP) and tidal volumes (TV) are highly variable, bearing the risk of ventilator induced lung injury. Additionally, positive end-expiratory pressure was shown to be lung protective. The aim was to assess the combined influence of operator and device specific influences on respiratory parameters in order to guarantee a lung protective management. We used simulated resuscitation scenario using a neonatal manikin approximating a 1 -kg preterm infant. A respiratory function monitor was fitted at the interface between mannequin and resuscitation device to: 1) measure PIP and TV application using a <b>self-inflating</b> bag compared to a T-piece device 2) to compare the influence of operator skills assessed by a questionnaire to applied PIP and TV, and 3) to assess the ability to consistently generate PEEP in <b>self-inflating</b> bags compared to T-piece-devices. Using the <b>self-inflating</b> bag PIP and TV were significantly higher compared to the T-piece device: median PIP was 25. 6 cmH 2 O vs. 19. 7 cmH 2 O (p< 0. 001); median TV was 5. 1 vs. 3. 6 ml (p< 0. 001). Using a <b>self-inflating</b> bag PIP and TV were highly dependent on operator specific skills. In contrast PIP and TV application did not depend on operator specific skills using a T-piece-device.

Methods: In a benchtop setting, the smallest non-disposable <b>self-inflating</b> bags from the Laerdal ® and Ambu ® ranges were tested.

Objective: To compare the ability of {{neonatal resuscitation}} personnel to deliver predetermined ventilation interventions using these devices in advance of a clinical trial of neonatal resuscitation. Design/methods: We studied 31 operators (neomatologists, neonatal respiratory therapists, neonatal fellows, a pediatrician, pediatric residents, neonatal nurse practitioners, and neonatal nurses) using aT-piece resuscitator (Neopuff®, Fisher&PaykelHealthcare,Auckland,NewZealand), a <b>self-inflating</b> bag (Baby Blue II, Vital Signs, Totowa, NJ), and a flow-inflating bag (Model E 191 Anesthesia Associates, San Marcos, CA). The <b>self-inflating</b> bag was tested with and without the manufacturer’s PEEP valve. Using a continuous pressure recording system and a neonatal manikin, we evaluated the ability to deliver a consistent PIP of 20 or 40 cmH 2 O and a PEEP of 5 cmH 2 O during 30 s of ventilation, the ability to maintain a 5 s inflation at a PIP of 20 cmH 2 O and the time to transition from a PIP of 20 to 40 cmH 2 O.

Methods: A <b>self-inflating</b> bag resuscitator and a mechanical ventilator were used to test two experimental models: Model 1 (CPR manikin without chest compression) and Model 2 (CPR manikin with chest compression). Model 2 was divided into three subgroups according to ventilator pressure limits (Plimit). The <b>self-inflating</b> bag resuscitator was set with a ventilation rate of 10 breaths/min with the volume-marked bag-valve procedure. The mode of the mechanical ventilator was set as follows: volume-controlled mandatory ventilation of tidal volume (Vt) 600 mL, an inspiration time of 1. 2 seconds, a constant flow pattern, a ventilation rate of 10 breaths/minute, a positive end expiratory pressure of 3 cmH 2 O and a maximum trigger limit. Peak airway pressure (Ppeak) and Vt were measured by a flow analyzer. Ventilation adequacy was determined at a Vt range of 400 - 600 mL with a Ppeak of ≤ 50 cmH 2 O. Results: In Model 1, Vt and Ppeak were in the appropriate range in the ventilation equipments. In Model 2, for the <b>self-inflating</b> bag resuscitator, the adequate Vt and Ppeak levels were 17 %, and the Ppeak adequacy was 20 % and the Vt was 65 %.
