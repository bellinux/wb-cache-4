60|$|I {{had been}} alone {{for nearly an}} hour before there came a {{cautious}} tapping at my door, I opened it at once, and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> visitor in surprise. It was the man in the grey tweed suit, who had broken into my room the night before.|$|E
60|$|At half-past three the {{restaurant}} was almost empty. Very soon after four I rang the bell of Lady Dennisford's town house in Park Lane. The man who opened it <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> request to see her Ladyship. Eventually, however, I persuaded him to take in a message. I wrote a single word upon a plain card, and in five minutes I was shown into a small boudoir.|$|E
2500|$|The episode [...] "Don't <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> childâ€¦he's an inspiration" [...] {{featured}} {{a number of}} kids with special needs and they all received surprises from Kyle.|$|R
60|$|He {{was flushed}} with {{excitement}} and trembling like a leaf. Yet {{at the sight}} that I presented he lost some of his high colour, and recoiled to <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> armour, battered, dinted, and splashed with browning stains, which loudly proclaimed the fray through which I had been.|$|R
60|$|I {{rose from}} my seat and <b>stared</b> solemnly <b>at</b> <b>my</b> misguided brother-in-law.|$|R
60|$|I <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> {{piece of}} paper. It was a cheque for five {{thousand}} pounds. I looked at Mabane's. It was a cheque for a like amount. Then I {{looked up at}} the Baron. The perspiration was standing out upon his forehead. He was watching us as a man might watch one in whose hands lay the power of life or death. I resisted my first impulse, which was simply to tear the cheque in two. I simply pushed it back across the table.|$|E
60|$|And {{just then}} {{something}} must have stirred in him, for {{he turned up}} his swollen nose and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> companion, and a little later rubbed the dry pinkness of his tongue against my thumb. In that look, and that unconscious restless lick; he was trying hard to leave unhappiness behind, trying hard to feel that these new creatures with stroking paws and queer scents, were his mother; yet {{all the time he}} knew, I am sure, that they were something bigger, more permanently, desperately, his. The first sense of being owned, perhaps (who knows) of owning, had stirred in him. He would never again be quite the same unconscious creature.|$|E
60|$|Indeed, {{when we met}} at breakfast, Eustace {{seemed to}} think himself injured by the {{interruption}} of his slumbers by Harold's coming to him for assistance in putting on his clothes, and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> dismay at his having permitted such an exertion. Before long, however, we saw an unmistakable doctor's gig approaching, and from it emerged Harold and Mr. Yolland. I saw {{now that he was}} a sturdy, hard-working-looking young man of seven or eight and twenty, with sandy hair, and an honest, open, weather-beaten face. He had a rather abrupt manner, but much more gentleman-like than that of the usual style of young Union doctors, who are divided between fine words and affectation and Sawbones roughness.|$|E
6000|$|... "The two Russian connoisseurs who <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> us so rudely were pleased, however, to also <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> work. They {{offered me}} a fabulous sum {{for one or two}} of my sketches. It didn't seem to me quite the square thing to old Favel the picture-dealer, whom I had forced to take a lot at one fifteenth the price, so I simply {{referred}} them to him." ...|$|R
60|$|The lady gave {{a violent}} start and <b>stared</b> in bewilderment <b>at</b> <b>my</b> companion.|$|R
60|$|The Duke {{leaned back}} in his chair and <b>stared</b> with amazement <b>at</b> <b>my</b> friend.|$|R
6000|$|Well do I {{remember}} in days gone by, how, with my juvenile mind addled and my juvenile fingers tingling after {{an application of}} the [...] "tawse," [...] I have <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> arithmetic book in despair--hopelessly ignorant {{of the meaning of}} words and terms, utterly incapable of comprehending explanatory [...] "rules," [...] passionately averse to learning in every form, and longingly anxious for the period of emancipation to arrive, when I should be old and big enough to thrash my master! No such feelings, sentiments, or difficulties can ever find a place in the breasts of those fortunate pupils whose happy lot has been cast in the Seminaries of Stellenbosch and Wellington.|$|E
60|$|But when I {{was neither}} {{sleeping}} nor eating I watched at my window, hoping, though in vain, to catch some sight of Otomie or of Guatemoc. If I might not see my friends, however, at least I saw my foe, for one evening de Garcia came and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> prison. He {{could not see}} me, but I saw him, and the devilish smile that flickered {{on his face as}} he went away like a wolf, made me shiver with a presage of woes to come. For ten minutes or more he stood gazing at my window hungrily, as a cat gazes at a caged bird, and I felt that he was waiting for the door to be opened, and KNEW that it would soon be opened.|$|E
6000|$|You {{should have}} seen how the people crowded to look at us, and admired my dancing too, for I cut {{the very best of}} capers, quite {{different}} {{to the rest of the}} gents (my Lord among the number), who walked through the quadrille as if they thought it a trouble, and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> activity with all their might. But when I have a dance I like to enjoy myself: and Mary Smith often said I was the very best partner at our assemblies. While we were dancing, I told Lady Jane how Roundhand, Gutch, and I, had come down three in a cab, besides the driver; and my account of our adventures made her Ladyship laugh, I warrant you. Lucky it was for me that I didn't go back in the same vehicle; for the driver went and intoxicated himself at the [...] "Yellow Lion," [...] threw out Gutch and our head clerk as he was driving them back, and actually fought Gutch afterwards and blacked his eye, because he said that Gutch's red waistcoat frightened the horse.|$|E
6000|$|I <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> her and <b>my</b> jaw dropped. Then I {{recovered}} myself, {{thinking she}} must {{have made a mistake}} and meant to say [...] "week." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{thus they}} arrived {{in the streets of}} shops of the little ugly town on top of the hill. How {{everybody}} <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> her; <b>my</b> word, how they stared! And the cinema was just going in, and the queues were tailing down the road to the corner. And everybody took full stock of her. 'Night, Harry!' shouted the fellows, in an interested voice.|$|R
5000|$|Of {{the nightclub}} ConFusion event, Taylor Race briefly {{described}} his Pine Valley town-experience with humor: [...] "If {{you think you}} {{put a lot of}} time and effort into a bit or break on the radio, think again when it comes to TV - you spend 20 minutes in makeup, just to get the mic flag on TV!" [...] he said, as he sipped his double half-caf, no-foam, extra hot, nonfat, 30% soy latte delivered by his assistant, Serge. [...] "I picked up some serious TSL today in Pine Valley...and a nasty rash too. I'd love to spend more time chatting with you, but the Daytime Emmy people are on Line 7, and Lucci is requesting The Goo Goo Dolls on Line 9. I will tell you that this daytime drama stuff is great - you just make stuff up! Hold on - I'm going to <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> cell phone for dramatic effect.... OK, that's a wrap! Lunch, everybody! Back on set at 3 pm!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't you speak?" [...] {{he inquired}} {{in a few}} moments, in a tone whose nonchalance seemed to {{intimate}} that it was {{much the same thing}} whether I answered or not. The fact is, I found it desirable to have recourse to my good friends [...] "les besicles;" [...] not exactly to ascertain the identity of my visitor--for I already knew him, confound his impudence! but to see how he looked--to get a clear notion of his mien and countenance. I wiped the glasses very deliberately, and put them on quite as deliberately; adjusting them so as not to hurt the bridge of my nose or get entangled in my short tufts of dun hair. I was sitting in the window-seat, with my back to the light, and I had him VIS-A-VIS; a position he would much rather have had reversed; for, at any time, he preferred scrutinizing to being scrutinized. Yes, it was HE, and no mistake, with his six feet of length arranged in a sitting attitude; with his dark travelling surtout with its velvet collar, his gray pantaloons, his black stock, and his face, the most original one Nature ever modelled, yet the least obtrusively so; not one feature that could be termed marked or odd, yet the effect of the whole unique. There is no use in attempting to describe what is indescribable. Being in no hurry to address him, I sat and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> ease.|$|E
6000|$|Finally the Soubah {{tried to}} persuade my people that one so incorrigibly obstinate must be mad, {{and that they had}} better leave me. One day, after we had had a long {{discussion}} about the geography of the frontier, he inflamed my curiosity by telling me that Kinchinjhow was a very holy mountain; more so than its sister-peaks of Chumulari and Kinchinjunga; and that both the Sikkim and Tibetan Lamas, and Chinese soldiers, were ready to oppose my approach to it. This led to my asking him for a sketch of the mountains; he called for a large sheet of paper, and some charcoal, and wanted to form his mountains of sand; I however ordered rice to be brought, and though we had but little, scattered it about wastefully. This had its effect: he <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> wealth, for he had all along calculated on starving me out, and retired, looking perplexed and crestfallen. Nothing puzzled him so much as my being always occupied with such, to him, unintelligible pursuits; a Tibetan [...] "cui bono?" [...] was always in his mouth: [...] "What good will it do you?" [...] "Why should you spend weeks on the coldest, hungriest, windiest, loftiest place on the earth, without even inhabitants?" [...] Drugs and idle curiosity he believed were my motives, and possibly a reverence for the religion of Boodh, Sakya, and Tsongkaba. Latterly he had made up his mind to starve me out, and was dismayed when he found I could hold out better than himself, and when I assured him that I should not retrace my steps until his statements should be verified by a letter from Tchebu; that I had written to him, {{and that it would be}} at least thirty days before I could receive an answer.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{struggled}} up. At first I was as incapable as a swathed infant--stepping with limbs I {{could not}} see. I was weak and very hungry. I went and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> nothing in <b>my</b> shaving-glass, <b>at</b> nothing save where an attenuated pigment still remained behind the retina of my eyes, fainter than mist. I had {{to hang on}} to the table and press my forehead against the glass.|$|R

40|$|Project (M. A., Art (Art Studio)) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2013. I {{entered into}} the Masters of Arts program with a {{determined}} mission in mind that is to push {{beyond the boundaries of}} my aesthetic, understand the meaning of my work and decide if art is the field, I want to pursue. In the process of going through the Masters of Arts program at Sacramento State, I have discovered the dynamics of the self and the influence of others. How they have exceedingly driven the boundaries of my work beyond what I ever imagined. The culmination of reading many books, blogs, theories, trips to the museums, galleries, attending lectures, studying historical and contemporary artists, discussions amongst my peers and professors, late nights spent in the studio, and all the in between have made it possible and worthwhile to emerge as an engaged artist into the art world. I will walk away with confidence in myself, the appreciation, discipline and dedication of a practicing studio artist, improved skills presenting museum/gallery worthy presentation of my work, the constructive criticisms that will float in my head while I sit and <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> work. In addition, I have a better understanding and appreciation for other art practices and theories. Art (Art Studio...|$|R
5000|$|In {{his later}} years, YYK {{suffered}} from {{many kinds of}} illnesses. He used to be hospitalized {{for months at a}} time; for myocardial infarction (1976), thighbone fracture (1979), heart surgery(1983), hip joint surgery(1984), several strokes and so on. Even though deteriorating health severely limited his activities, YYK remained serene and sharp to the end. Almost defiantly, YYK refused to rest and said in an interview, [...] "Now that I am getting old, I need more enthusiasms and stimuli to continue. When I <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> paintings, I feel passionate tension, which fills me with some ardor and enthusiasm. I will train myself and paint with this kind of passion and enthusiasm to the end." [...] In his final days, he could work less than few hours a day on a wheelchair. The works created around this time, when he lived in Deungchon-dong and Bangbae-dong, bring the sense of tenderness and comfort because they are painted in pure colors and figures are presented in softer and gentler way more than ever. The screen has been flattened and the basic patterns; such as circles, triangles, and rectangles depicting sky, mountain, Sun, trees, etc. are repeated to deliver joy and delights of life.|$|R
5000|$|Megan {{was living}} in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and Corin {{residing}} in Montreal producing his instrumentals, and how far apart {{they were at the}} time, 1300km, was a part of developing each song, as it put newness and freshness to the tracks. Corin described the process of making the instrumentals: [...] "Late nights, sometimes I'll <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> laptop for hours; sometimes I'll take an idea, a five second snippet that I'll run with over and over and over". Corin then sent it to Megan for her to sing a rough vocal sketch over it, with Corin's waiting leading to excitement and anticipation of not knowing what the final song would sound like when Megan sent it back. He described what he would do with a song after Megan sent it back: [...] "I'll often need to rearrange them to create a focal point. And that might mean moving something else that was underneath to {{a different part of the}} song, or just removing it altogether. I'm not very precious with any part of any track when it comes to trying to make it into an actual song; if it's taking up too much space, I'll gladly get rid of it." ...|$|R
60|$|That winter {{we spent}} without bacon, and our salt gave out at Christmas. It {{was at this}} season, if I {{remember}} rightly, that we had another visitor. He arrived about nightfall one gray day, his horse jaded and cut, and he was dressed all in wool, with a great coat wrapped about him, and high boots. This made me <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> him. When <b>my</b> father drew back the bolt of the door he, too, stared and fell back a step.|$|R
6000|$|... "Beware," [...] she said, [...] "you do not, by your ill-timed anger, {{cut off the}} {{opportunity}} I yet have to indemnify {{the world for the}} errors of my ignorance. In yonder coal-hole, not used for many a year, repose the few greasy and blackened fragments of the elder Drama which were not totally destroyed. Do thou then"--Why, what do you <b>stare</b> <b>at,</b> Captain? By <b>my</b> soul, it is true; as my friend Major Longbow says, [...] "What should I tell you a lie for?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Several reviewers {{commented on}} its value as {{art and the}} extent to which it {{generated}} discussion and reflection. For fellow art game designer Jason Rohrer, [...] "The game, and my experience discussing it, have reminded me of experiences at galleries of modern art---for each piece, I <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> it, scratch <b>my</b> head a bit, and try to mine the piece for meaning of some kind. I'm also reminded of watching a David Lynch movie with friends---we'd spend the rest of the evening discussing what the movie might mean." ...|$|R
60|$|As I did so, out of {{the corner}} of my eye I caught sight of {{something}} that glittered far away, so far that it would only have attracted the notice of a trained hunter. Yes, something was shining on the brow of the rise of which I have spoken. I <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> it through <b>my</b> glasses and saw what I had feared to see. A body of natives was crossing the rise and the glitter was caused by the rays of dawn striking on their spears and gun-barrels.|$|R
60|$|ARRIVED in the drawing-room, Grosse placed me {{in a chair}} {{near the}} window. He leaned forward, {{and looked at me}} close; he drew back, and looked at me from a distance; he took out his {{magnifying}} glass, and had a long <b>stare</b> through it <b>at</b> <b>my</b> eyes; he felt my pulse; dropped my wrist as if it disgusted him; and, turning to the window, looked out in grim silence, without taking the slightest notice of any one in the room.|$|R
60|$|But {{the thing}} that troubled me was nearer hand. Some dozen young men and {{children}} made {{a piece of a}} half-circle, flanking my house: the river divided them, some were on the near side, some on the far, and one on a boulder in the midst; and they all sat silent, wrapped in their sheets, and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> me and <b>my</b> house as straight as pointer dogs. I thought it strange as I went out. When I had bathed and come back again, and found them all there, and two or three more along with them, I thought it stranger still. What could they see to gaze <b>at</b> in <b>my</b> house, I wondered, and went in.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{never saw}} {{anything}} so black as the mangroves. I <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> them till <b>my</b> eyes {{were ready to}} burst. And then I'd look at the stars, {{and listen to the}} surf sighing along the reef. And there was a dog that barked. Remember that dog, Sparrowhawk? The brute nearly gave me heart- failure when he first began. After a while he stopped--wasn't barking at the landing party at all; and then the silence was harder than ever, and the mangroves grew blacker, and it was all I could do to keep from calling out to Curtis in there in the landing boat, just to make sure that I wasn't the only white man left alive.|$|R

6000|$|That {{important}} {{portion of}} the town is a rather spacious and irregularly shaped vacuity, surrounded by houses and shops, some of them old, with red-tiled roofs, others wearing a pretence of newness, but probably as old in their inner substance as the rest. The people of Uttoxeter seemed very idle in the warm summer-day, and were scattered in little groups along the sidewalks, leisurely chatting with one another, and often turning {{about to take a}} deliberate <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> humble self; insomuch that I felt as if my genuine sympathy for the illustrious penitent, and my many reflections about him, must have imbued me with some of his own singularity of mien. If their great-grandfathers were such redoubtable starers in the Doctor's day, his penance was no light one. This curiosity indicates a paucity of visitors to the little town, except for market purposes, and I question if Uttoxeter ever saw an American before. The only other thing that greatly impressed me was the abundance of public-houses, one at every step or two Red Lions, White Harts, Bulls' Heads, Mitres, Cross Keys, and I know not what besides. These are probably for the accommodation of the farmers and peasantry of the neighborhood on market-day, and content themselves with a very meagre business on other days of the week. At any rate, I was the only guest in Uttoxeter at the period of my visit, and had but an infinitesimal portion of patronage to distribute among such a multitude of inns. The reader, however, will possibly be scandalized to learn what was the first, and, indeed, the only important affair that I attended to, after coming so far to indulge a solemn and high emotion, and standing now on the very spot where my pious errand should have been consummated. I stepped into one of the rustic hostelries and got my dinner,--bacon and greens, some mutton-chops, juicier and more delectable than all America could serve up at the President's table, and a gooseberry pudding; a sufficient meal for six yeomen, and good enough for a prince, besides a pitcher of foaming ale, the whole at the pitiful small charge of eighteen-pence! ...|$|R
