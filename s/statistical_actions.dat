Fire station is one of these buildings. Sisakht City is located in a region with high risk of earthquake. To seismic evaluate the structure, the strong ground motion parameters should be estimated. Horizontal acceleration is one of the basic strong ground motion parameters. at this paper acceleration has been determined applying the available methods and equations for two criterions, design base earthquake and maximum credible earthquake. They have been found applying analytical methods based on analyzing the historical earthquakes and probabilistic methods of doing <b>statistical</b> <b>actions</b> on the data and applying the main distribution functions of type I,III and S.

40|$|AbstractSequence-specific binding to genomic-size DNA {{sequences}} by artificial agents is {{of major}} {{interest for the}} development of gene-targeting strategies, gene-diagnostic applications, and biotechnical tools. The binding of one such agent, peptide nucleic acid (PNA), to a randomized human genome has been modeled with <b>statistical</b> mass <b>action</b> calculations. With the length of the PNA probe, the average per-base binding constant k 0, and the binding affinity loss of a mismatched base pair as main parameters, the specificity was gauged as a “therapeutic ratio”G=maximum safe [PNA]tot/minimal efficient [PNA]tot. This general, though simple, model suggests that, above a certain threshold length of the PNA, the microscopic binding constant k 0 is the primary determinant for optimal discrimination, and that only a narrow range of rather low k 0 values gives a high therapeutic ratio G. For diagnostic purposes, the value of k 0 could readily be modulated by changing the temperature, due to the substantial ΔH° associated with the binding equilibrium. Applied to gene therapy, our results stress the need for appropriate control of the binding constant and added amount of the gene-targeting agent, to meet the varying conditions (ionic strength, presence of competing DNA-binding molecules) found in the cell...|$|R
40|$|Prior {{research}} has shown that infants learn <b>statistical</b> regularities in <b>action</b> sequences better than they learn non-action event sequences. This is consistent with current theories claiming that the same mechanism guides action observation and action execution. The current eye-tracking study tested the prediction, based on these theories, that infants' ability to learn <b>statistical</b> regularities in <b>action</b> sequences is modulated by their own motor abilities. Eight- to 11 -month-old infants observed an action sequence containing two deterministic action pairs (i. e., action A always followed by action B) embedded within an otherwise random sequence. One pair was performed with a whole-hand grasp. The second pair was performed with a pincer grasp, a fine motor skill that emerges around 9 months of age. Infants were then categorized into groups according to which grasp was dominant in their motor repertoire. Predictive looks to correct upcoming actions during the deterministic pairs were analyzed to measure whether infants learned and anticipated the sequence regularities. Findings indicate that infants learned the statistical regularities: across motor groups, they made more correct than incorrect predictive fixations to upcoming actions. Overall, learning was not significantly modulated by their dominant grasping abilities. However, infants with a dominant pincer grasp showed an earlier increase in correct predictions for the pincer grasp pair and not the whole-hand grasp. Likewise, infants with a dominant whole-hand grasp showed an early increase in correct predictions for the pair performed with a whole-hand grasp, and not the pincer grasp. Together, these findings suggest that infants' ability to learn action sequences is facilitated when the observed action matches their own action repertoire. However, findings cannot be explained entirely by motor accounts, as infants also learned the actions less congruent with their own abilities. Findings are discussed in terms of the interplay between the motor system and additional non-motor resources during the acquisition of new motor skills in infancy...|$|R

40|$|With {{reference}} to a previous work, {{the problem of the}} experimental detection of non-causal synordination patterns between two series of physical events is examined. It is necessary that the patterns in question act in a reproducible, or at least regular, manner, {{so that they can be}} identified by means of <b>statistical</b> analysis; <b>action</b> on individual occasional facts cannot be proved statistically, though it is hypothetically possible. As established in the previous work, the first series must be constituted by microevents (Penrose R processes), that can be amplified at the macroscopic level so that they are translated at this level into a choice between alternatives. The obtained result defines (by means of a structural constraint which is not, however, a causal link) the choice between execution or non-execution of certain actions on a macroscopic system S, without any feedback on the microevents source. A succession of macroevents is thus generated, which makes up the second series. Statistics of the events belonging to the second series is thus completely defined by the probability distribution of the first series of events. In the absence of a synordination, this is the a priori probability distribution, which can be measured by removing the constraint between the two series. If there is synordination, the probability distribution of the two sets of events will deviate in a measurable manner from the expected trend once the constraint is activated.

Orbits of the group are defined on the sample space and on the parameter space; in particular the group action is called transitive when there is only one orbit. Credibility sets and confidence sets are shown (under right invariant prior and assuming transitivity on the parameter space) to be equal when defined by permissible sub-parameters and constructed from equivariant estimators. The effect of different choices of transformation group is illustrated by examples, and properties of the the orbits on the sample space and on the parameter space are discussed.

Recent evidence has shown that infants can detect <b>statistical</b> regularities in <b>action</b> sequences they observe, but {{little is known about}} the neural process that give rise to this ability. In the current experiment, we combined electroencephalography (EEG) with eye-tracking to identify electrophysiological markers that indicate whether 8 – 11 -month-old infants detect violations to learned regularities in action sequences, and to relate these markers to behavioral measures of anticipation during learning. In a learning phase, infants observed an actor performing a sequence featuring two deterministic pairs embedded within an otherwise random sequence. Thus, the first action of each pair was predictive of what would occur next. One of the pairs caused an action-effect, whereas the second did not. In a subsequent test phase, infants observed another sequence that included deviant pairs, violating the previously observed action pairs. Event-related potential (ERP) responses were analyzed and compared between the deviant and the original action pairs. Findings reveal that infants demonstrated a greater Negative central (Nc) ERP response to the deviant actions for the pair that caused the action-effect, which was consistent with their visual anticipations during the learning phase.

40|$|<b>Statistical</b> {{classification}} of <b>actions</b> in videos is mostly performed by extracting relevant features, particularly covariance features, from image frames and studying time series associated with temporal evolutions of these features. A natural mathematical representation of activity videos is {{in form of}} parameterized trajectories on the covariance manifold, i. e. the set of symmetric, positive-definite matrices (SPDMs). The variable execution-rates of actions implies variable parameterizations of the resulting trajectories, and complicates their classification. Since action classes are invariant to execution rates, one requires rate-invariant metrics for comparing trajectories. A recent paper represented trajectories using their transported square-root vector fields (TSRVFs), defined by parallel translating scaled-velocity vectors of trajectories to a reference tangent space on the manifold. To avoid arbitrariness of selecting the reference and to reduce distortion introduced during this mapping, we develop a purely intrinsic approach where SPDM trajectories are represented by redefining their TSRVFs at the starting points of the trajectories, and analyzed as elements of a vector bundle on the manifold. Using a natural Riemannain metric on vector bundles of SPDMs, we compute geodesic paths and geodesic distances between trajectories in the quotient space of this vector bundle, {{with respect to the}} re-parameterization group. This makes the resulting comparison of trajectories invariant to their re-parameterization. We demonstrate this framework on two applications involving video classification: visual speech recognition or lip-reading and hand-gesture recognition.

40|$|A quantum kinetic {{formalism}} {{is developed}} {{to study the}} dynamical interplay of quantum and statistical-kinetic properties of non-equilibrium multi-parton systems produced in high-energy QCD processes. The approach provides the means to follow the quantum dynamics in both space-time and energy-momentum, starting from an arbitrary initial configuration of high-momentum quarks and gluons. Using a generalized functional integral representation and adopting the `closed-time-path' Green function techniques, a self-consistent set of equations of motions is obtained: a Ginzburg-Landau equation for a possible color background field, and Dyson-Schwinger equations for the 2 -point functions of the gluon and quark fields. By exploiting the `two-scale nature' of light-cone dominated QCD processes, i. e. the separation between the quantum scale that specifies the range of short-distance quantum fluctuations, and the kinetic scale that characterizes the range of <b>statistical</b> binary inter- <b>actions,</b> the quantum-field equations of motion are converted into a correspon- ding set of `renormalization equations' and `transport equations'. The former describe renormalization and dissipation effects through {{the evolution of the}} spectral density of individual, dressed partons, whereas the latter determine the statistical occurrence of scattering processes among these dressed partons. The renormalization equations and the transport equations are coupled, and hence must be solved self-consistently. This amounts to evolving the multi-parton system, from a specified initial configuration, in time and full 7 -dimensional phase-space. This description provides a proba- bilistic interpretation and is therefore of important practical value for the solution of the dynamical equations of motion, e. g. by Monte Carlo simulation.

Small vessels, considering total maritime traffic in the Adriatic Sea, play an important role, although their numbers are often not considered as a potential security risk.

The first part of this paper shows, thru analysis of SAR <b>action</b> <b>statistical</b> data, that the total number of all accidents is dominated by accidents involving small vessels.

They were divided into 5 experimental groups (n= 10) : G 1 : 2 % chlorhexidine solution (10 min); G 2 : 0. 5 % sodium hypochlorite (10 min); G 3 : modified sodium hypochlorite (10 min); G 4 : effervescent agent (5 min); G 5 : hydrogen peroxide 10 v (30 min). The specimens of the control group 1 (C 1) were not disinfected. Ten additional specimens of the control group 2 (C 2) were not infected with the yeast, aiming to check the asepsis during the experiment. The disinfection agents were neutralized and the acrylic resin specimens were immersed in BHI Broth for 24 h. Culture media turbidity was evaluated spectrophotometrically according to the transmittance degree, i. e. the higher the transmittance the stronger the antimicrobial <b>action.</b> <b>Statistical</b> analysis was performed (Kruskal-Wallis Test, p< 0. 05). RESULTS: The results, represented by the medians, were: G 1 = 40; G 2 = 100; G 3 = 100; G 4 = 90; G 5 = 100; C 1 = 40; C 2 = 100. CONCLUSIONS: This in vitro study suggested that sodium hypochlorite-based substances and hydrogen peroxide are more efficient disinfectants against C. albicans than 2 % chlorhexidine solution and the effervescent agent...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop bilingual health advocate (BHA) -led group education and support groups for South Asian patients with diabetes, based on a storytelling format. The design and setting were action research in a deprived inner London district. The research team worked developmentally with BHAs, service users and other stakeholders to assess need, train staff, and set up and evaluate the storytelling groups. Stories were chosen as the main vehicle for education because of their universal appeal, memorability, holistic perspective, ethical dimensions, and potential for multiple interpretations. Key challenges in the project were: high burden of need; multiple stakeholders; a shifting baseline of policy directives; frequent staff changes; resource constraints; and resistance of top and middle management to new service models. These difficulties made progress slow, and several early initiatives failed to take root. However, we succeeded in developing a nationally accredited training programme ('Storytelling for group work in health and care') for BHAs, and in supporting the graduates from this course to set up two groups for South Asian patients with diabetes - one in a hospital and one in a community centre. The patient storytelling groups, once established, were popular and well evaluated. Blood glucose levels in regular attenders fell, but changes did not reach <b>statistical</b> significance. An <b>action</b> research approach allowed us successfully to develop an innovative training programme for BHAs and support them in developing and mainstreaming new service models. BHA-led diabetes storytelling groups, supported by health professionals, are feasible and popular with non-English speaking Asian patients. Their impact on diabetes outcomes should now be formally evaluated in clinical trials. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd...|$|R
