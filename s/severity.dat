5|$|Several {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that the condition in most children improves with maturity. Tics may be at their highest <b>severity</b> at the time that they are diagnosed, and often improve with understanding of the condition by individuals and their families and friends. The statistical age of highest tic <b>severity</b> is typically between eight and twelve, with most individuals experiencing steadily declining tic <b>severity</b> as they pass through adolescence. One study showed no correlation with tic <b>severity</b> and the onset of puberty, in contrast with the popular belief that tics increase at puberty. In many cases, a complete remission of tic symptoms occurs after adolescence. However, a study using videotape to record tics in adults found that, although tics diminished in comparison with childhood, and all measures of tic <b>severity</b> improved by adulthood, 90% of adults still had tics. Half of the adults who considered themselves tic-free still displayed evidence of tics.|$|E

Let the counting distribution be multivariate and the <b>severities</b> one-dimensional; we consider the distribution of, say m, random variables with compound distributions whose counting variables are dependent whereas the <b>severities</b> are mutually independent and independent of the counting vari-ables. The two approaches can be combined by letting the <b>severities</b> in Case 2 be random vectors. ….

40|$|AbstractThis study {{evaluated}} steam (SE) explosion on the saccharification and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) {{of waste}} copier paper.

Changes in chemical composition were evident at <b>severities</b> greater than 4. 24 resulting {{in a loss of}} xylose and the production of breakdown products known to inhibit fermentation (particularly formic acid and acetic acid). SE did not improve final yields of glucose or ethanol, and at <b>severities</b> 4. 53 and 4. 83 reduced yields probably due to the effect of breakdown products and fermentation inhibitors. However, at moderate <b>severities</b> of 3. 6 and 3. 9 there was an increase in initial rates of hydrolysis which may provide a basis for reducing processing times. Co-steam explosion of waste copier paper and wheat straw attenuated the production of breakdown products, and may also provide a basis for improving SSF of lignocellulose...|$|R

40|$|Using Monte Carlo {{simulation}} {{to calculate}} the Value at Risk (VaR) as a possible risk measure requires adequate techniques. One of these techniques is {{the application of a}} compound distribution for the aggregates in a portfolio. In this paper, we consider the aggregated loss of Gamma distributed <b>severities</b> and estimate the VaR by introducing a new approach {{to calculate the}} quantile function of the Gamma distribution at high confidence levels. We then compare the VaR obtained from the aggregation process with the VaR obtained from a single loss distribution where the <b>severities</b> are drawn first from an exponential and then from a truncated exponential distribution. We observe that the truncated exponential distribution {{as a model for the}} <b>severities</b> yields results closer to those obtained from the aggregation process. The deviations depend strongly on the number of obligors in the portfolio, but also on the amount of gross loss which truncates the exponential distribution...|$|R

Permanent disability is thought to occur in 10% of mild injuries, 66% of moderate injuries, and 100% of severe injuries. Most mild TBI is completely resolved within threeweeks, and almost all people with mild TBI are able to live independently and return to the jobs they had before the injury, although a portion have mild cognitive and social impairments. Over 90% of people with moderate TBI are able to live independently, although a portion require assistance in areas such as physical abilities, employment, and financial managing. Most people with severe closed head injury either die or recover enough to live independently; middle ground is less common. Coma, as it is closely related to <b>severity,</b> is a strong predictor of poor outcome.|$|E
