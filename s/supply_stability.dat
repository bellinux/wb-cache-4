50|$|By 2008 raw {{materials}} such as Iron ore prices grew and China had to reluctantly agree to price increases by the three largest iron ore producers in the world; BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Vale. During the Global financial crisis the Chinese steel mills won price reprieves as demand from their customers slowed. When the demand started to pick up again in 2009 and in 2010, the price crept back up due to higher demand for automobiles, low interest rates, government fiscal stimuli around the world. Prices for iron ore were negotiated on an annual contract pricing scheme. Australian iron ore producers were not happy that iron prices did not reflect Spot market pricing. In 2010 pressure from BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto {{to move to a}} quarterly based index pricing succeeded. Many Japanese steel mills and Chinese steel companies had to follow as demand for {{raw materials}} heated up. Spot-basis pricing has caused problems for steel manufacturers such as exposing them to price fluctuation in the market and reducing the stability of resource supply. Steel mills prefer long term pricing to hedge against cost and maintain raw material <b>supply</b> <b>stability.</b> Rio Tinto has said it will cancel contracts and sell the steel on the spot markets if Chinese steel mills back down on the new quarterly pricing regime.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{a dynamic}} model is {{presented}} to study retailer’s procurement strategy when <b>supply</b> <b>stability</b> is endogenously determined. The optimal <b>supply</b> <b>stability</b> {{as well as the}} optimal purchasing strategy are characterized with a quadratic cost function. Based on these models, the following findings are brought about. Firstly, when the difficulty level of building <b>supply</b> <b>stability</b> exceeds a certain threshold, it would be more profitable for the retailer to choose a less reliable supplier. Secondly, given that the suppliers can get positive profit, the retailer would choose the one who has the strongest ability to be reliable. Thirdly, the equilibrium supply to the retailer would always meet the demand on the retailing market. Finally, emergency procurement is shown to be an effective way {{to reduce the risk of}} supply chain disruptions. To better fit the real situations, an extended model which considers the impact of the stability on costs is further discussed...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{implications}} of channel power on <b>supply</b> chain <b>stability</b> in a setting where multiple suppliers sell substitutable products through a common retailer. Such supply chains have been traditionally analyzed as one- or two-stage Stackelberg non-cooperative games with all suppliers sharing balanced (equal) decision-making power. In this paper, we relax this assumption and formulate game-theoretic models to examine scenarios where one supplier can act as the Stackelberg leader. Consequently, we analyze new supply chain structures and introduce the notion of structure dominance, a novel approach to analyze the performance of supply chains that has practical implications. Thus, a decision maker can employ the concepts of structure dominance {{to determine whether there}} exist supply chain scenarios that are more stable than others, i. e., less prone to power reconfigurations, at both agent and group level. We find that power imbalance causes significant declines in supply chain profits, and the more balanced the agents are the higher their profits when demand is linear, regardless of product competition. It develops that neither the Manufacturer Stackelberg nor the Retailer Stackelberg supply chains are stable structures in our generalized setting, but that structures where power is equally split between agents provide for best stability and performance.

Adequacy, quality of <b>supply,</b> <b>stability,</b> reliability and voltage collapse along with costs have been always carefully considered when planning the future of the electric power system. Since 1982, when world’s deregulation process started, the introduction of competition at generation level brought new challenges, while the proper operation of the electric power system still require physical coordination between non cooperative agents. The increasing development of SCADA/EMS systems, the growing number of market participants, and the development of more complex market schemes have been more and more relying on Information Technologies, making the physical system more vulnerable to cyber security risks. Now cyber security risks look bigger than the physical ones. We developed a review of some of the vulnerability risks that actual electric power systems face, showing some implementation issues of it. We also comment some the steps that NERC is leading to ensure a secure energy sourcing to the U. S. Economy...|$|E
40|$|A {{model to}} {{investigate}} a fuel based optimality approach for strategic investments in the power sector is presented. The innovative concept of switching between the available operating fuel sources of the power plant over its lifetime is examined. More specifically, the case study examined, concerns an existing lignite power plant that may switch its fuel to natural gas, and {{from that point on}} it may either switch back to lignite or retain natural gas or routinely switch between the alternative fuels. This research concentrates on the electricity market of Greece, for the period of 2010 - 2030. Probabilistic models to forecast future prices are used in conjunction with a real options model to cope with alternative strategies. Depending on the economical and environmental standings of each period, the power plant can alter its input fuel to maximize profits or reduce emissions. Therefore, more options for the operating fuel emerge, thus reducing business risks and exploiting the most profitable operational option in response to markets instabilities (i. e. fuel price differences over time, emissions cost fluctuation, etc.). Strategic flexibility, security of <b>supply,</b> <b>stability,</b> and increased profits are the potential advantages of the presented model dealing with energy investments...|$|E

40|$|Recent food crises have {{highlighted}} {{the need to}} better understand the between-year variability of agricultural production. Although increasing future production seems necessary, the globalization of commodity markets suggests that the food system would also benefit from enhanced <b>supplies</b> <b>stability</b> through a reduction in the year-to-year variability. Here, we develop an analytical expression decomposing global crop yield interannual variability into three informative components that quantify how evenly are croplands distributed in the world, the proportion of cultivated areas allocated to regions of above or below average variability and the covariation between yields in distinct world regions. This decomposition is used to identify drivers of interannual yield variations for four major crops (i. e., maize, rice, soybean and wheat) over the period 1961 - 2012. We show that maize production is fairly spread but marked by one prominent region with high levels of crop yield interannual variability (which encompasses the North American corn belt in the USA, and Canada). In contrast, global rice yields have a small variability because, although spatially concentrated, much of the production is located in regions of below-average variability (i. e., South, Eastern and South Eastern Asia). Because of these contrasted land use allocations, an even cultivated land distribution across regions would reduce global maize yield variance, but increase the variance of global yield rice. Intermediate results are obtained for soybean and wheat for which croplands are mainly located in regions with close-to-average variability. At the scale of large world regions, we find that covariances of regional yields have a negligible contribution to global yield variance. The proposed decomposition could be applied at any spatial and time scales, including the yearly time step. By addressing global crop production stability (or lack thereof) our results contribute to the understanding of a key aspect of global food availability...|$|R
