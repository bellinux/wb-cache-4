40|$|The {{response}} of very long span bridges due to wind action is well recognised {{to depend on}} the spanwise correlation of aerodynamic forces on the bridge section in turbulent wind flow. Previous analytical and model studies were often based on the spatial distribution of the incoming gusts and pressure correlation measurements on two-dimensional bridge section models. The bridge deck sectional forces are, however, generally more coherent than the gust eddies due to the wind excited vortices that occur and interact along the span. Wind tunnel model and full scale measurements on West Gate Bridge more than two decades ago had shown that the negative pressures under reattaching shear layers {{on the surface of the}} bridge deck were much better correlated than the approach fluctuating wind velocities. This paper further investigates this phenomenon in terms of <b>sectional</b> <b>force</b> correlation, in particular, on a full bridge model in motion with respect to the wind turbulence effects...|$|E
40|$|In {{the finite}} element method, there are {{shortcomings}} using the conventional formulae {{to calculate the}} <b>sectional</b> <b>forces,</b> i. e., the bending moment and the shear force, at any cross-section of Bernoulli-Euler beam under dynamic loads. This paper presents some new finite-element formulae overcoming the shortcomings of the conventional ones to calculate the <b>sectional</b> <b>forces</b> at any cross-section of a Bernoulli-Euler beam on continuously viscoelastic foundation subjected to concentrated moving loads. The proposed formulae can easily degenerate into the formulae for calculating the <b>sectional</b> <b>forces</b> of a simply supported or a continuous Bernoulli-Euler beam subjected to concentrated moving loads, and into the formulae for calculating the <b>sectional</b> <b>forces</b> of a Bernoulli-Euler beam on Winkler foundation under static loads.

Velocity fields, phase-locked with the blade rotational motion, are acquired across several planes perpendicular to the blade axis and merged to form a 3 D measurement volume. Transonic conditions have been reached at the tip region, with a revolution frequency of 19, 800 rpm and a relative free-stream Mach number of 0. 73 at the tip. The pressure field and the surface pressure distribution are inferred from the 3 D velocity data through integration of the momentum Navier-Stokes equation in differential form, allowing for the simultaneous flow visualization and the aerodynamic loads computation, with respect to a reference frame moving with the blade.

40|$|Accurate {{structural}} {{models are}} required for optimal management of existing bridges and economical new ones. However, unavoidable modelling uncertainties and difficulty in modelling the non-linear response of concrete bridges can lead to structural models which do not fulfil this requirement. To estimate uncertain modelling parameters and obtain a more accurate finite element (FE) model, {{it is possible to}} improve an initial finite element model, using on-site measurements through FE model updating. A methodology for FE model updating of bridges is proposed. It starts by removing lower bound assumptions from the initial model, as these are commonly used for the design of bridges but are not appropriate for FE model updating. Furthermore, manual model refinements, a parameter study, updating by non-linear optimization, evaluation of model parameter changes, and preparation of the model for further analysis are included. The application of this methodology to the new Svinesund Bridge led to a significantly more accurate FE model. It was also possible to verify the designers’ assumptions of critical details of the bridge. For more frequent practical application of non-linear FE analysis, reliable, easy to verify, and computationally fast and stable analytical methods are needed. Hence, an overview of ideas, approaches and methods is given, which can be used to simplify general non-linear FE analysis. This includes simplifying element formulations which allow the use of material models of reduced dimensions, <b>sectional</b> <b>force</b> dependent stiffnesses, and sectional force-generalised strain relations to include the non-linear response on the element level, rather than on the material level, as well as constitutive modelling in the nodal force-nodal deformation space. Furthermore, ways to analyse numerous load cases in combination with non-linear FE analysis are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Code based shear design {{provisions}} principally use a <b>sectional</b> <b>force</b> design {{procedure in}} which it is assumed that plane sections remain plane. However, the shear capacity of a member may be limited by other shear related phenomena that are not captured in codes of practice. These nontraditional limitations on the shear capacity of a member can result from incorrectly evaluating the shear stress that needs to be transmitted across a crack, shearcompression failure along a web-flange interface, or insufficient capacity of longitudinal tension reinforcement at the support. A series of 20 shear tests were completed on ten 52 -foot long and 63 -inch deep prestressed bulb-tee bridge girders cast with high-strength concrete. An extensive amount of experimental data was gathered and advanced data analysis tools were utilized to evaluate these nontraditional limitations on shear capacity. It was determined that interface shear transfer resistance in high-strength concrete is predicted well by relationships developed from tests on normal-strength concrete specimens. It was further observed that the angle of web-shear cracking was generally steeper than the angle of principal compressive stress as given by the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications. This difference in angles creates a significant shear demand on a crack that is not accounted for in the LRFD Specifications. A method is presented for determining if a shear-compression failure along a webflange interface is a potential mode of failure for a prestressed bridge girder. This approach provides a means of calculating the shear stress that must be transmitted across the interface {{as a function of the}} geometry and loading on the member as well as a means of calculating the shear resistance along the web-flange interface. This method can be used to guard against a shear-compression failure by placing a limitation on the maximum shear capacity a member. It was also determined that the requirement for longitudinal tension reinforcement near the support included in the 4 th edition of the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications may underestimate the demand on longitudinal tension reinforcement. Alternatively an equilibrium based approach is presented for determining demand on longitudinal tension reinforcement near the support. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{oscillatory flow}} around a {{circular}} cylinder {{close to a}} plane wall is investigated numerically, by direct numerical simulation of the Navier–Stokes equations. The main {{aim of the research}} is to gain insight into the effect of the wall on the vorticity dynamics and the forces induced by the flow over the cylinder. First, two-dimensional simulations are performed for nine values of the gap-to-diameter ratio e. Successively, three-dimensional simulations are carried out for selected cases to analyse the influence of the gap on the three-dimensional organization of the flow. An attempt to explain the pressure distribution around the cylinder in terms of vorticity time development is presented. Generally, the time development of the hydrodynamic forces is aperiodic (i. e. changes from cycle to cycle). In one case (Re = 200), when the distance of the cylinder from the wall is reduced, the behaviour of the flow changes from aperiodic to periodic. When the cylinder approaches the wall the drag coefficient of the in-line force increases in a qualitative agreement with the results reported in literature. The transverse force is not monotonic with the reduction of the gap: it first decreases down to a minimum, and then increases with a further reduction of the gap. For intermediate values of the gap the decrease of the transverse force is due to the reduction of the angle of ejection of the shedding vortices caused by the closeness of the wall; for small gaps the increase of the transverse force is due to the strong interaction between the vortex system ejected from the cylinder and the shear layer generated on the wall. Three-dimensional simulations show that the flow is unstable with respect to spanwise perturbations which cause the development of three-dimensional vortices and the distortion of the two-dimensional ones generated by flow separation. In all the analysed cases, the three-dimensional effects on the hydrodynamic forces are clearly attenuated when the cylinder is placed close to the wall. The spanwise modulation of the vortex structures induces oscillations of the sectional forces along the axis of the cylinder which in general are larger for the transverse <b>sectional</b> <b>force.</b> In the high-Reynolds-number case (Re = 500), the reduction of the gap produces a large number of three-dimensional vortex structures developing over a wide range of spatial scales. This produces homogenization of the flow field along the spanwise direction and a consequent reduction of the amplitudes of oscillation of the sectional forces...|$|E

40|$|This thesis aims to {{investigate}} the dynamic response of a high rise concrete structure. Calculations are performed for Lerkendal Hotel, a slender 75 meter high building located in Trondheim. Buffeting response has been the main focus in the calculations, and both displacements, accelerations and cross <b>sectional</b> <b>forces</b> have been obtained. Initially, acceleration demands regarding human comfort in a structure subjected to wind induced vibrations were established using design codes. In addition, the expected structural damping of a high rise concrete structure was estimated using literature. To determine basic dynamic properties for the given structure, a modal FEM-analysis was conducted using SAP 2000. A theoretical study was performed to establish the basis needed for buffeting response calculations. The structure {{was treated as a}} cantilevered, line like beam. A MATLAB computer program was made to perform all calculations. Using given and estimated input values, single mode single component response calculations were conducted for the two first translational modes. In addition, accelerations and cross <b>sectional</b> <b>forces</b> were estimated using Eurocode 1 : 1 - 4 to serve as a conservative basis for comparison. The obtained cross <b>sectional</b> <b>forces</b> for wind excitation of the first mode were found to be considerably higher than the forces obtained from building design codes. It was found likely that the bending stiffness of the structure had been estimated too high, resulting in high resonant forces. For wind excitation of the second mode, theoretical forces proved to coincide well to forces obtained from the Eurocode. The frequency weighted acceleration was found to be much higher than the perception limit for both modes. Estimates from design codes supported the high values. As a possible solution, it was proposed that tuned mass dampers could be installed in the structure to reduce the acceleration. It was also suggested that the perception limit used could be too strict for the given structure regarding human comfort. </p...|$|R

40|$|Over time people´s way of {{life has}} changed and thus the use of {{existing}} structures. There is a considerable value in continuing to use these structures and adapt them to today´s needs. In recent decades, the bike has a more significant role in everyday life, which requires a secure and highly available infrastructure. The town of Sundsvall has {{expressed a desire to}} explore the possibility of moving traffic lanes on Alnö Bridge {{to make way for a}} wider sidewalk. Transport Administration has ordered an investigation of the load carrying capacity of Alnö Bridge to evaluate if it is possible to adapt the existing bridge to today ´s needs as well as to check its current status. The Alnö Bridge was built in the 1960 ´s and connects the island Alnön with the mainland just north of Sundsvall. It is built as a Freivorbau bridge in prestressed concrete. Calculations are in this report performed to evaluate the <b>sectional</b> <b>forces</b> in the bridge. This is done using the finite element method, where the focus is on how the prestressed concrete is covered in a finite element model. Recently use of the finite element method has increased for analysis of structures because it provides a more accurate description of reality. For this reason it may be possible to increase the load carrying capacity of a structure, which is examined in this thesis by performing a comparison of the <b>sectional</b> <b>forces</b> calculated by the displacement method. For this reason it is possible to increase the resistance of a structure, which is examined in this thesis by performing a comparison of <b>sectional</b> <b>forces</b> calculated by the displacement method. The results demonstrate lower <b>sectional</b> <b>forces</b> in all the finite element models in comparison with the model performed with the displacement method. This indicates that a higher load carrying capacity can be achieved by using the finite element method. The results show up to 17 % lower results for bending moment, 13 % for lateral forces and 23 % regarding torque. Stress concentrations have been identified at the connection between the web and the bridge deck, where the longitudinal, transversal and vertical prestressed tendons interact. The results show that local stress concentrations occur in the concrete with tensile stresses up to 5, 517 MPa, which is higher than the tensile strength of most concrete classes. The evaluation of these stress concentrations has been limited and a more thorough investigation is necessary before it may be possible to use them for designing purposes. The expectations when the thesis was started were to be able to take into account the large amount of prestressed tendons in a detailed manner. Due to the fact that the finite element programs was not built to calculate the time dependent prestress losses that occur in the prestressed tendons, time consuming manual calculations were required. This means that the effects of performing a detailed finite element model became less important. In summary, the finite element method is a good method to analyze prestressed concrete structures but the implementation was more difficult and time consuming than anticipated. It requires detailed work procedures for the model to reflect reality and it requires a good knowledge of the conditions that apply. Validerat; 20131008 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R

In order to establish the buffet load without the PAL ramp, a wind tunnel test was conducted where segments of the protuberances were instrumented with dynamic pressure transducers; and power-spectra of sectional lift and drag forces at various span-wise locations between two adjacent support brackets were measured under different cross flow angles, Mach number and other conditions.

The k - omega SST and Realizable k - epsilon turbulence models were found to offer good overall simulations, with the k - omega SST performing better for the surface {{pressure and}} the Realizable k - epsilon better for the wake. The simulations at various ride heights correctly captured the trends in flow-field variations with ride height. The surface pressures, wake flow field, and region of separation on the suction surface of the aerofoil, at lower ride heights, were all modeled accurately...|$|R
40|$|The {{nonlinear}} dynamic {{response of}} civil structures with energy dissipating devices is studied. The structure is modeled using the Vu Quoc–Simo formulation for beams in finite deformation. The effects of shear stresses are considered, allowing rotating the local system of each beam {{independently of the}} position of the beam axis. The material nolinearity is treated at material point level with an appropriated constitutive law for concrete and fiber behavior for steel reinforcements and stirrups. The simple mixing theory is used to treat the resulting composite. The equation of motion of the system as well as the conservation laws are expressed in terms of <b>sectional</b> <b>forces</b> and generalized strains and the dynamic problem is solved in the finite element framework. A specific kind of finite element is proposed for modeling the energy dissipating devices. Several tests were conducted to validate the ability of the model to reproduce the nonlinear response of concrete structures subjected to earthquake loading.

40|$|Majority of the {{concrete}} structural components in general are subjected to different load combinations. The internal forces acting on any section in general can be categorized into four basic actions. These are (a) Flexural moments, (b) Axial loads, (c) Sh ear forces and (d) Torsion. These actions may occur alone or in combination with others and they effect the structures in different ways under various conditions. Some of these combinations can include significant shear and torsion. The shear and bending f orces acting maybe lateral (along Z - axis) or vertical (along Y - axis). The action of all the <b>sectional</b> <b>forces</b> are shown in Fig. 1. 1. The behavio u r of RC members under combinations of flexure, shear and axial load has been relatively well understood. Wherea s, the behavior under shear and torsion are more complicated and the detailed studies conducted on these are very limited. There are several studies conducted to study the behavior under torsion and the earlier models developed could predict only the ultim ate loads carried by the section...|$|R
