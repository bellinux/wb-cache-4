5|$|Some of the tele{{recorded}} Pertwee episodes also {{survive on}} NTSC colour videotapes, recorded over-air on consumer hardware. In the early 1990s, an early {{form of the}} Doctor Who Restoration Team attempted to pair the low-resolution colour <b>signal</b> <b>from</b> these sources with the high-resolution black-and-white <b>signal</b> <b>from</b> the black-and-white film recordings. In this way, several Jon Pertwee stories were returned to a rough form of colour: Doctor Who and the Silurians, Terror of the Autons, and The Dæmons. Off-air NTSC colour tapes were also recovered for all of The Ambassadors of Death, but were considered of too poor a quality to permit more than a partial restoration.|$|E

A clear-cut distinction is observed between recently produced papers and the other samples: recent papers show just EPR <b>signals</b> <b>from</b> Mn(II) and sometimes small <b>signals</b> <b>from</b> Fe(III) in rhombic site, while the older samples show usually strong <b>signals</b> <b>from</b> Fe(III), Mn(II), Cu(II) and radicals. Furthermore, Mn(II) EPR <b>signals</b> <b>from</b> recent papers are characterized by small zero-field splitting (ZFS) parameters, indicating Mn(II) in high-symmetry sites, while older samples show broader Mn(II) EPR signals, typical for Mn(II) in low-symmetry sites (increased ZFS parameters) ...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{approach}} was proposed to denoise quadrature Doppler <b>signals</b> <b>from</b> bi-directional blood flow using the wavelet frame and a soft-thresholding algorithm. A direction separation step was firstly {{carried out to}} avoid the phase distortion of quadrature Doppler signals, which is induced from the non-linear soft-thresholding processing. Then real parts of separated complex <b>signals</b> <b>from</b> the uni-directional flow were denoised independently. Finally quadrature Doppler <b>signals</b> <b>from</b> the bi-directional flow were reconstructed from the denoised separated signals. The approach {{has been applied to}} the simulated Doppler <b>signals</b> <b>from</b> a femoral artery. It is concluded from the experimental results that this method is practical for denoising quadrature Doppler signals...|$|R
5|$|The most {{important}} and widely used application of the heterodyne technique is in the superheterodyne receiver (superhet), invented by U.S. engineer Edwin Howard Armstrong in 1918. In this circuit, the incoming radio frequency <b>signal</b> <b>from</b> the antenna is mixed with a <b>signal</b> <b>from</b> a local oscillator (LO) and converted by the heterodyne technique to a lower fixed frequency signal called the intermediate frequency (IF). This IF is amplified and filtered, before being applied to a detector which extracts the audio signal, which {{is sent to the}} loudspeaker.|$|E

5|$|A hub is able {{to support}} low {{bandwidth}} devices mixed with other speed device via a special PID value, PRE. This is required as a USB hub functions as a very simple repeater, broadcasting the host message to all connected devices regardless if the packet was for it or not. This means in a mixed speed environment, {{there is a potential}} danger that a low speed will misinterpret a high or full speed <b>signal</b> <b>from</b> the host.|$|E
40|$|Interference by {{structural}} vibrations {{reduced by}} adding <b>signals</b> <b>from</b> spatially separated gyros. Technique involves blending <b>signals</b> <b>from</b> rate gyroscopes located at {{different parts of}} structure to obtain composite signal that more nearly represents rotation of entire structure. Aircraft vibrations perpendicular to pitch axis contribute to rotations sensed by pitch-rate gyros. Proper blending of <b>signals</b> <b>from</b> gyros suppress contribution of dominant vibrational mode. Most likely applications of concept are flight-control systems for aircraft...|$|R

5|$|Starting in 1940, British {{aircraft}} {{were increasingly}} {{equipped with the}} IFF Mk.

IFF was a responder that sent out a pulse of radio signal immediately on reception of a radio <b>signal</b> <b>from</b> a radar system. The IFF's transmission mixed with the radar's own pulse, causing the blip to stretch out in time from a small peak to an extended rectangular shape.|$|E

5|$|As Lennon hated doing {{a second}} take to double his vocals, Ken Townsend, the studio's {{technical}} manager, developed an alternative form of double-tracking called artificial double tracking (ADT) system, taking the <b>signal</b> <b>from</b> the sync {{head of one}} tape machine and delaying it slightly through a second tape machine. The two tape machines used were not driven by mains electricity, but from a separate generator which put out a particular frequency, the same for both, thereby keeping them locked together. By altering the speed and frequencies, he could create various effects, which the Beatles used throughout the recording of Revolver. Lennon's vocal is double-tracked on the first three verses of the song: {{the effect of the}} Leslie cabinet can be heard after the (backwards) guitar solo.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{suggestion}} of , the antennae of the Submillimeter Array, a radio-wave astronomical observatory on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, are arranged on four nested Reuleaux triangles. Placing the antennae on a curve of constant width causes the observatory {{to have the same}} spatial resolution in all directions, and provides a circular observation beam. As the most asymmetric curve of constant width, the Reuleaux triangle leads to the most uniform coverage of the plane for the Fourier transform of the <b>signal</b> <b>from</b> the array. The antennae may be moved from one Reuleaux triangle to another for different observations, according to the desired angular resolution of each observation. The precise placement of the antennae on these Reuleaux triangles was optimized using a neural network. In some places the constructed observatory departs from the preferred Reuleaux triangle shape because that shape was not possible within the given site.|$|E
