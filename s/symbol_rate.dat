25|$|The net {{bit rate}} of the Ethernet 100Base-TX {{physical}} layer standard is 100Mbit/s, while the gross bitrate is 125Mbit/second, due to the 4B5B (four bit over five bit) encoding. In this case, the gross bit rate {{is equal to the}} <b>symbol</b> <b>rate</b> or pulse rate of 125megabaud, due to the NRZI line code.|$|E
25|$|The {{orthogonality}} {{also allows}} high spectral efficiency, {{with a total}} <b>symbol</b> <b>rate</b> near the Nyquist rate for the equivalent baseband signal (i.e. near half the Nyquist rate for the double-side band physical passband signal). Almost the whole available frequency band can be utilized. OFDM generally has a nearly 'white' spectrum, giving it benign electromagnetic interference properties with respect to other co-channel users.|$|E
25|$|The {{gross bit}} rate {{is related to the}} <b>symbol</b> <b>rate</b> or {{modulation}} rate, which is expressed in bauds or symbols per second. However, the {{gross bit rate}} and the baud value are equal only when there are only two levels per symbol, representing 0 and 1, meaning that each symbol of a data transmission system carries exactly one bit of data; for example, {{this is not the case}} for modern modulation systems used in modems and LAN equipment.|$|E

25|$|One key {{principle}} of OFDM {{is that since}} low <b>symbol</b> <b>rate</b> modulation schemes (i.e., where the symbols are relatively long compared to the channel time characteristics) suffer less from intersymbol interference caused by multipath propagation, it is advantageous to transmit a number of low-rate streams in parallel instead of a single high-rate stream. Since the duration of each symbol is long, it is feasible to insert a guard interval between the OFDM symbols, thus eliminating the intersymbol interference.|$|E
25|$|PSK31's <b>symbol</b> <b>rate</b> of 31.25Hz {{was chosen}} because a normal typing speed of about 50 words per minute {{requires}} a bit rate of about 32 bits per second, and specifically because 31.25Hz could easily be derived from the 8kHz sample rate used in many DSP systems, including those used in the computer sound cards commonly used for PSK31 operation (31.25Hz is 8kHz divided by 256, and so {{can be derived from}} 8kHz by halving the frequency eight times in succession).|$|E
25|$|The primary {{advantage}} of OFDM over single-carrier schemes {{is its ability}} to cope with severe channel conditions (for example, attenuation of high frequencies in a long copper wire, narrowband interference and frequency-selective fading due to multipath) without complex equalization filters. Channel equalization is simplified because OFDM may be viewed as using many slowly modulated narrowband signals rather than one rapidly modulated wideband signal. The low <b>symbol</b> <b>rate</b> makes the use of a guard interval between symbols affordable, making it possible to eliminate intersymbol interference (ISI) and utilize echoes and time-spreading (on analogue TV these are visible as ghosting and blurring, respectively) to achieve a diversity gain, i.e. a signal-to-noise ratio improvement. This mechanism also facilitates the design of single frequency networks (SFNs), where several adjacent transmitters send the same signal simultaneously at the same frequency, as the signals from multiple distant transmitters may be combined constructively, rather than interfering as would typically occur in a traditional single-carrier system.|$|E

2500|$|OFDM is a {{frequency-division}} multiplexing (FDM) scheme {{used as a}} digital multi-carrier modulation method. [...] A large number of closely spaced orthogonal sub-carrier signals are used to carry data [...] on several parallel data streams or channels. Each sub-carrier is modulated with a conventional modulation scheme (such as quadrature amplitude modulation or phase-shift keying) at a low <b>symbol</b> <b>rate,</b> maintaining total data rates similar to conventional single-carrier modulation schemes in the same bandwidth.|$|E
2500|$|A simple example: A useful symbol {{duration}} TU = 1ms {{would require}} a sub-carrier spacing of [...] (or an integer multiple of that) for orthogonality. N = 1,000 sub-carriers {{would result in a}} total passband bandwidth of NΔf = 1MHz. For this symbol time, the required bandwidth in theory according to Nyquist is [...] (half of the achieved bandwidth required by our scheme), where R is the bit rate and where N = 1,000 samples per symbol by FFT. If a guard interval is applied (see below), Nyquist bandwidth requirement would be even lower. The FFT would result in N = 1,000 samples per symbol. If no guard interval was applied, this would result in a base band complex valued signal with a sample rate of 1MHz, which {{would require a}} baseband bandwidth of 0.5MHz according to Nyquist. However, the passband RF signal is produced by multiplying the baseband signal with a carrier waveform (i.e., double-sideband quadrature amplitude-modulation) resulting in a passband bandwidth of 1MHz. A single-side band (SSB) or vestigial sideband (VSB) modulation scheme would achieve almost half that bandwidth for the same <b>symbol</b> <b>rate</b> (i.e., twice as high spectral efficiency for the same symbol alphabet length). It is however more sensitive to multipath interference.|$|E
