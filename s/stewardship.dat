5|$|Gambling: The AG opposes gambling, {{believing that}} it is a {{disregard}} of responsible <b>stewardship,</b> involves a chance of gain at the expense and suffering of others, is inconsistent with the work ethic of scripture, and tends to be habit forming.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, <b>stewardship</b> of Gedi {{was turned}} over to the National Museums of Kenya. The site is {{currently}} administered by the museum's Department of Coastal Archaeology. In 2000, the construction of a museum funded by the European Union concluded, which features a permanent display on Swahili culture.|$|E
5|$|The Mexican fishery for the California {{spiny lobster}} {{was the first}} Latin American fishery to be awarded the Marine <b>Stewardship</b> Council's {{sustainable}} fishery ecolabel, and the species is classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|A major dilemma {{faced by}} Morales' {{administration}} {{was between the}} desire to expand extractive industries in order to fund social programs and provide employment, {{and to protect the}} country's environment from the pollution caused by those industries. Although his government professed an environmentalist ethos, expanding environmental monitoring and becoming a leader in the voluntary Forest <b>Stewardship</b> Council, Bolivia continued to witness rapid deforestation for agriculture and illegal logging.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{important}} botanical {{questions of the}} 21st century are the role of plants as primary producers in the global cycling of life's basic ingredients: energy, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and water, and ways that our plant <b>stewardship</b> can help address the global environmental issues of resource management, conservation, human food security, biologically invasive organisms, carbon sequestration, climate change, and sustainability.|$|E
5|$|Another intense fixture {{is that of}} the New Firm derby between United and North-East rivals Aberdeen. The match itself {{became one}} of fierce {{competition}} due to the domestic and European success the two sides achieved in the late 1970s and 1980s under the <b>stewardship</b> of United's Jim McLean and Aberdeen's Alex Ferguson.|$|E
5|$|Appointees to {{the offices}} of Steward of the Manor of Northstead and Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds are alternated so that two MPs can resign at once (as {{happened}} on 23 January 2017). However every new appointment to the <b>Stewardship</b> revokes the previous appointment {{so there is no}} difficulty in situations in which more than two resign, such as the 1985 walkout of Ulster Unionist MPs when several separate appointments were made on a single day.|$|E
5|$|In October 2003, McCain and Lieberman co-sponsored the Climate <b>Stewardship</b> Act {{that would}} have {{introduced}} a cap and trade system aimed at returning greenhouse gas emissions to 2000 levels; the bill was defeated with 55votes to 43 in the Senate. They reintroduced modified versions of the Act two additional times, most recently in January 2007 with the co-sponsorship of Barack Obama, among others.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, most helium is {{extracted}} from natural gas of the Hugoton and nearby gas fields in Kansas, Oklahoma, and the Panhandle Field in Texas. Much of this gas was once sent by pipeline to the National Helium Reserve, but since 2005 this reserve is being depleted and sold off, {{and is expected}} to be largely depleted by 2021, under the October 2013 Responsible Helium Administration and <b>Stewardship</b> Act (H.R. 527).|$|E
5|$|Pearson was a Liberal and {{was elected}} at the 1847 general {{election}} as a Member of Parliament for Lambeth. His campaign {{was prompted by}} a desire to promote his penal reform campaign in parliament. He resigned his seat in 1850 thorough the mechanism of accepting the <b>Stewardship</b> of the Chiltern Hundreds.|$|E
5|$|Sir John Chancellor, {{the first}} Governor of Southern Rhodesia, after his {{retirement}} in 1928 spoke of the progress that the country had made in its first years of responsible government under the <b>stewardship</b> of Sir Charles Coghlan. The country's economy grew, with annual revenue increasing from £1.3 million to £2 million, with exports up from £8.5 million to £12 million, despite setbacks in the cotton and tobacco industries.|$|E
5|$|The Catechism {{explains}} that this commandment regulates worldly goods, and forbids unjustly taking, using or damaging those {{that belong to}} someone else. It places requirements upon those who possess worldly goods to use them responsibly, taking into consideration the good of society. The Catechism addresses the concept of human <b>stewardship</b> of God's creation in its explanation of the seventh commandment and forbids abuse of animals and the environment.|$|E
5|$|The Church {{has also}} {{addressed}} <b>stewardship</b> {{of the natural}} environment, {{and its relationship to}} other social and theological teachings. In the document Laudato si', dated 24 May 2015, Pope Francis critiques consumerism and irresponsible development, and laments environmental degradation and global warming. The pope expressed concern that the warming of the planet is a symptom of a greater problem: the developed world's indifference to the destruction of the planet as humans pursue short-term economic gains.|$|E
5|$|The Everton {{chairman}} Sir John Moores {{who presided}} over the club between 1960 and 1973 provided finances for the club in the form of loans to become involved in large-scale redevelopment projects and compete with other clubs for the best players, {{for a period of time}} under his <b>stewardship</b> Everton were known as 'The Mersey Millionaires'.|$|E
5|$|The {{section of}} M-25 in the City of Bay City was named {{what is now}} called a Pure Michigan Historic Byway by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). This {{designation}} was created on October 23, 1997, for the section of M-25 along Center Avenue between Madison Avenue and the eastern city limits. Originally called the Bay City Historic Heritage Route", it has been called the Center Avenue Heritage Route by its local <b>stewardship</b> committee.|$|E
5|$|Under the <b>stewardship</b> of Richard Assheton Cross, the Home Secretary, Disraeli's new {{government}} enacted many reforms, including the Artisans' and Labourers' Dwellings Improvement Act 1875, which made inexpensive loans available to {{towns and cities}} to construct working-class housing. Also enacted were the Public Health Act 1875, modernising sanitary codes through the nation, the Sale of Food and Drugs Act (1875), and the Education Act (1876).|$|E
5|$|Abrahams Creek has a {{watershed}} association {{known as the}} Abrahams Creek Watershed Association. It was awarded the Watershed <b>Stewardship</b> Award by the Luzerne Conservation District in 2009. The organization also received a $5000 grand from American Water for improving water quality, adding riparian buffers, and other projects. Damaging flooding in 2006 caused the Abrahams Creek Watershed Assessment and Project Prioritization to be created. The creek {{was used as a}} reference watershed by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection when developing a total maximum daily load for the nearby Solomon Creek.|$|E
5|$|At Easter, 1151, Theobald {{took over}} the {{management}} of the chapter's estates, as the new prior, Walter Parvus, was not up to the task. At first, there were no disputes, but soon the monks felt that Theobald was cheating them and imposing too rigorous a definition of poverty, and asked that the <b>stewardship</b> of the estates be restored to Parvus. Theobald refused and the monks attempted to appeal to the papacy. Their envoys, however, were caught by agents of the archbishop and the appeal went nowhere. Theobald then deposed Parvus and appointed a new prior. Theobald's relations with the monks after this point seem to have been without incident.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{magnitude}} {{of many of the}} units comprising the SI system of measurement is ultimately defined by the mass of a -year-old, golf-ball-sized piece of metal, the quality of the IPK must be diligently protected to preserve the integrity of the SI system. Yet, despite the best <b>stewardship,</b> the average mass of the worldwide ensemble of prototypes and the mass of the IPK have likely diverged another µg since the third periodic verification years ago. Further, the world's national metrology laboratories must wait for the fourth periodic verification to confirm whether the historical trendspersisted.|$|E
5|$|By 1844, Albert {{had managed}} to modernise the royal {{finances}} and, through various economies, had sufficient capital to purchase Osborne House on the Isle of Wight as a private residence for their growing family. Over {{the next few years}} a house modelled in the style of an Italianate villa was built to the designs of Albert and Thomas Cubitt. Albert laid out the grounds, and improved the estate and farm. Albert managed and improved the other royal estates; his model farm at Windsor was admired by his biographers, and under his <b>stewardship</b> the revenues of the Duchy of Cornwall—the hereditary property of the Prince of Wales—steadily increased.|$|E
5|$|From 1976 until a {{few weeks}} before his death, Caspersen ran the Hodson Trust, {{established}} by Beneficial founder Clarence Hodson to award grants to four colleges in Maryland: Hood College, The Johns Hopkins University, St. John’s College, and Washington College. Under the first 25 years of Caspersen's <b>stewardship,</b> the trust donated over $118million to the four institutions. Caspersen was awarded honorary degrees for his service to education; Washington College conferred an honorary Doctor of Humanities degree in 1981 and Hood College awarded Caspersen with an honorary Doctor of Laws degree in 1983.|$|E
5|$|Galen Clark {{retired as}} the state grant's {{guardian}} in 1896, leaving Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove of Big Trees under ineffective <b>stewardship.</b> Pre-existing problems in the state grant worsened and new problems arose, but the cavalry could only monitor the situation. Muir and the Sierra Club continued to lobby the government and influential people {{for the creation of}} a unified Yosemite National Park. The Sierra Club began to organize annual trips to Yosemite in 1901 in an effort to make the remote area more accessible.|$|E
5|$|In June 1995, Arsenal {{appointed}} Bruce Rioch, who {{had just}} guided Bolton Wanderers to the League Cup final and promotion to the top flight, as manager. Under his <b>stewardship,</b> the club broke the English transfer record by paying Internazionale £7.5million for Dutch striker Dennis Bergkamp and the new signing formed an impressive partnership with Ian Wright. Arsenal reached the League Cup semi-finals and finished fifth in the Premier League {{at the end of}} 1995–96, securing a place in the following season's UEFA Cup.|$|E
5|$|In March 2006, the Rocky Flats <b>Stewardship</b> Council {{was formed}} to address {{post-closure}} management of Rocky Flats and provide a forum for public discussion. This organization was the successor organization to the Rocky Flats Coalition of Local Governments, which advocated for stakeholders during the site cleanup. The Council includes elected officials from nine municipal governments neighboring Rocky Flats and four skilled/experienced organizations and/or individuals. Information and Council meetings minutes and reports are available on its website. Members of the public are welcome to attend Council meetings.|$|E
5|$|Juan de San Buenaventura's {{small group}} of Franciscans arrived in Chuntuki on 30 August 1695. In early November 1695, two Franciscans were sent to {{establish}} a mission at Pak'ek'em, where they were well received by the cacique (native chief) and his pagan priest. Pak'ek'em was sufficiently far from the new Spanish road that it was free from military interference, and the friars oversaw {{the building of a}} church in what was the largest mission town in Kejache territory. A second church was built at B'atkab' to attend to over 100 K'ejache refugees who had been gathered there under the <b>stewardship</b> of a Spanish friar; a further church was established at Tzuktok', overseen by another friar.|$|E
5|$|Most {{references}} say {{the position}} {{was first used}} in this way on 20 March 1844 to allow Sir George Henry Rose, Member for Christchurch, to resign his seat in Parliament, but the official book containing appointments to the <b>Stewardship</b> (lodged in The National Archives under catalogue reference E 197/1) indicates that Patrick Chalmers, Member for Montrose Burghs, was appointed to this office on 6 April 1842 {{so that he could}} resign due to ill health. The writ ordering the election of a replacement MP was changed so that it appeared Chalmers had been appointed to the Chiltern Hundreds.|$|E
5|$|Sustainable use of {{materials}} has targeted {{the idea of}} dematerialization, converting the linear path {{of materials}} (extraction, use, disposal in landfill) to a circular material flow that reuses materials as much as possible, much like the cycling and reuse of waste in nature. This approach is supported by product <b>stewardship</b> and {{the increasing use of}} material flow analysis at all levels, especially individual countries and the global economy. The use of sustainable biomaterials that come from renewable sources and that can be recycled is preferred to the use on non-renewables from a life cycle standpoint.|$|E
5|$|The LS3/5A is {{a commercially}} {{produced}} loudspeaker {{driven by the}} need of the BBC to monitor and assess broadcast programme quality. It {{was derived from the}} LS3/5, which was conceived and developed by the BBC Engineering Department in the early 1970s, when it was under the <b>stewardship</b> of Dudley Harwood. Having found no commercially produced small loudspeaker that met the requirement for naturalness and sonic neutrality, the BBC specifically set out to design a speaker to achieve natural overall sound quality and good dynamic range for monitoring broadcasts in tightly confined spaces.|$|E
5|$|The Rhodesia Party {{remained}} in power until September 1933, when, despite narrowly topping the popular vote, it lost the month's election, winning only {{nine of the}} 30 seats compared to the Reform Party's 16. Although the Reform Party was left-wing in name, many of its leading members, including the new Prime Minister Dr Godfrey Huggins, were politically conservative; the more rightist members of the party merged with the Rhodesia Party in 1934 to form the United Party, and, with Huggins at the helm, roundly defeated the rump left wing of the Reform Party to begin 28 years of uninterrupted <b>stewardship.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{is a list of}} chairmen of Malmö FF and the club's major honours from the founding of the club in 1910 to the present day. As of the start of the 2015 season, nine men have held the club chairmanship, of whom two have held the job for multiple spells. Counting each of these periods separately, there have been 12 chairmen. The most successful Malmö FF chairman in terms of trophies won is Eric Persson, under whose <b>stewardship</b> the side won its first 10 Swedish championships, as well as eight Svenska Cupen final victories. Persson is also the club's longest-serving chairman, having held the post for 38 years, from 1937 to 1975.|$|E
5|$|The {{reclamation}} of Chat Moss and Trafford Moss was innovative in {{that instead}} of constructing roads to give access for the material to be dumped onto the bog, a movable light railway was developed. Narrow gauge track– which allowed {{the weight of the}} wagons to be spread evenly across an area of the bog– was temporarily laid down and then picked up and relaid elsewhere as needed. Roscoe was declared bankrupt in 1821, but the reclamation work continued under the <b>stewardship</b> of others who took over his leasehold interest, amongst them William Baines, the anti-Corn Law MP and owner of the Leeds Mercury newspaper.|$|E
5|$|The {{site was}} {{once part of}} the estate linked to Clevedon Court. It is now managed via a Higher Level <b>Stewardship</b> {{agreement}} between the National Trust and Natural England. This has involved removing trees whose roots are growing into the earthen banks of the site. In particular non native Turkey Oaks, which provide a habitat for damaging Gall wasps, are being removed. Cattle are also being used to manage the scrub and encourage the growth of flowers such as orchids.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{important}} trees species and specimens; a Grand Fir in Argyll is the tallest tree in the United Kingdom and the Fortingall Yew may be the oldest tree in Europe. The Arran Whitebeams, Shetland Mouse-ear and Scottish Primrose are endemic flowering plants and there {{are a variety}} of endemic mosses and lichens. Conservation of the natural environment is well developed and various organisations play an important role in the <b>stewardship</b> of the country's flora. Numerous references to the country's flora appear in folklore, song and poetry.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{disagreement}} among modern scholars {{on whether}} David ceded to the Byzantines only those lands {{which had been}} granted {{to him as a}} reward for his assistance against the rebel Bardas Skleros, or if it had been the whole of his principality that was acquired by Basil II. As the former was endowed upon David for lifetime <b>stewardship,</b> it would be more reasonable to assume that he conceded his entire realm, i.e., Thither Tao/Tayk and the adjacent Armenian counties up to Lake Van. Whatever the extent of David’s domain, the Georgian kings would not so easily reconcile with the loss of those territories, leading to a series of conflicts with the Byzantine Empire in the eleventh century.|$|E
