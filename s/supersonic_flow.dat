25|$|The flow {{in a real}} {{exhaust port}} can easily be sonic with choked flow {{occurring}} and even <b>supersonic</b> <b>flow</b> in areas. The very high temperature causes the viscosity of the gas to increase, all of which alters the Reynolds number drastically.|$|E

Subsonic, <b>supersonic</b> and, highly <b>supersonic</b> <b>flows</b> are studied. Various techniques for accelerating the convergence to a steady state are described and analyzed. Effects of the grid aspect ratio on the rate of convergence are evaluated. An enthalpy damping technique applicable to <b>supersonic</b> <b>flows</b> is described in detail.

40|$|A {{review is}} {{presented}} of methods in which composite or reduced Navier-Stokes (RNS) equations {{are treated with}} a pressure-gradient-based flux-vector splitting. The methods are similar to large Re asymptotic formulations, and streamwise diffusion terms are ignored {{in favor of an}} explicit deferred corrector based on higher-order diffusion terms. The methods can be used for 2 D and 3 D <b>supersonic</b> <b>flows</b> in which the effects of real gas are incorporated. Several examples of the procedure are given, and subsonic and <b>supersonic</b> <b>flows</b> are handled well with relaxation procedures that incorporate multigrid acceleration. Effective solutions are described for problems ranging from incompressible <b>flows</b> and <b>supersonic</b> <b>flows</b> to sharp shocks and reverse-flow capturing...|$|R
25|$|Supersonic {{pressure}} recovery is {{addressed by the}} number of shock waves that are generated by the intake, the greater the number the higher the {{pressure recovery}}. <b>Supersonic</b> <b>flow</b> is compressed or slowed by changes in direction. The Concorde intake front ramps changed the flow direction causing oblique external shocks and isentropic compression in the <b>supersonic</b> <b>flow.</b> The TSR-2 had used a half-cone translating centre-body to change the direction. Subsonic pressure recovery is addressed by removal of the boundary layer (at the ramp bleed slot) and suitable shaping of the subsonic diffuser leading to the engine. The high pressure recovery for the Concorde intake at cruise gave an intake pressure ratio of 7.3:1.|$|E
25|$|Later {{research}} into airflows near {{or above the}} speed of sound used a related approach. Metal pressure chambers were used to store high-pressure air which was then accelerated through a nozzle designed to provide <b>supersonic</b> <b>flow.</b> The observation or instrumentation chamber ("test section") was then placed at the proper location in the throat or nozzle for the desired airspeed.|$|E
25|$|While many flows (e.g. flow {{of water}} through a pipe) occur at low Mach numbers, many flows of {{practical}} interest in aerodynamics or in turbomachines occur at high fractions of M=1 (transonic flows) or in excess of it (supersonic or even hypersonic flows). New phenomena occur at these regimes such as instabilities in transonic flow, shock waves for <b>supersonic</b> <b>flow,</b> or non-equilibrium chemical behaviour due to ionization in hypersonic flows. In practice, each of those flow regimes is treated separately.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} {{picture of the}} mechanisms driving the transition from subsonic to <b>supersonic</b> <b>flows</b> in tokamak plasmas. We demonstrate that <b>supersonic</b> parallel <b>flows</b> into the divertor volume are ubiquitous at low density and governed by the divertor magnetic geometry. As the density is increased, subsonic divertor plasmas are recovered. On detachment, we show the change in particle source can also drive {{the transition to a}} supersonic regime. The comprehensive theoretical analysis is completed by simulations in ITER geometry. Such results are essential in assessing the divertor performance and when interpreting measurements and experimental evidence. The generation of large-scale flows in laboratory plasma is a highly non-linear problem. In a standard fashion it is considered that the flows remain subsonic away from the wall, the occurrence of <b>supersonic</b> <b>flows</b> being singular. We show here that the geometrical features of key configurations for fusion plasma can lead to <b>supersonic</b> <b>flows...</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{shock wave}} {{is one of}} several {{different}} ways in which a gas in a <b>supersonic</b> <b>flow</b> can be compressed. Some other methods are isentropic compressions, including Prandtl-Meyer compressions. The method of compression of a gas results in different temperatures and densities for a given pressure ratio which can be analytically calculated for a non-reacting gas. A shock wave compression results in a loss of total pressure, meaning that it is a less efficient method of compressing gases for some purposes, for instance in the intake of a scramjet. The appearance of pressure-drag on supersonic aircraft is mostly due to the effect of shock compression on the flow.|$|E
25|$|Scramjet (supersonic {{combustion}} ramjet) engines {{present a}} much different situation for the combustor than conventional gas turbine engines (scramjets are not gas turbines, they generally have few or no moving parts). While scramjet combustors may be physically quite different from conventional combustors, they face {{many of the same}} design challenges, like fuel mixing and flame holding. However, as its name implies, a scramjet combustor must address these challenges in a <b>supersonic</b> <b>flow</b> environment. For example, for a scramjet flying at Mach 5, the air flow entering the combustor would nominally be Mach 2. One of the major challenges in a scramjet engine is preventing shock waves generated by combustor from traveling upstream into the inlet. If that were to happen, the engine may unstart, resulting in loss of thrust, amongst other problems. To prevent this, scramjet engines tend to have an isolator section (see image) immediately ahead of the combustion zone.|$|E
25|$|As {{aircraft}} {{began to}} travel faster, aerodynamicists {{realized that the}} density of air began to change as it {{came into contact with}} an object, leading to a division of fluid flow into the incompressible and compressible regimes. In compressible aerodynamics, density and pressure both change, which is the basis for calculating the speed of sound. Newton was the first to develop a mathematical model for calculating the speed of sound, but it was not correct until Pierre-Simon Laplace accounted for the molecular behavior of gases and introduced the heat capacity ratio. The ratio of the flow speed to the speed of sound was named the Mach number after Ernst Mach, {{who was one of the}} first to investigate the properties of <b>supersonic</b> <b>flow</b> which included Schlieren photography techniques to visualize the changes in density. William John Macquorn Rankine and Pierre Henri Hugoniot independently developed the theory for flow properties before and after a shock wave. Jakob Ackeret led the initial work on calculating the lift and drag on a supersonic airfoil. Theodore von Kármán and Hugh Latimer Dryden introduced the term transonic to describe flow speeds around Mach 1 where drag increases rapidly. Because of the increase in drag approaching Mach 1, aerodynamicists and aviators disagreed on whether supersonic flight was achievable.|$|E

500|$|Neptune's {{weather is}} characterised by {{extremely}} dynamic storm systems, with winds reaching speeds of almost —nearly reaching <b>supersonic</b> <b>flow.</b> More typically, by tracking {{the motion of}} persistent clouds, wind speeds {{have been shown to}} vary from 20m/s in the easterly direction to 325m/s westward. At the cloud tops, the prevailing winds range in speed from 400m/s along the equator to 250m/s at the poles. Most of the winds on Neptune move in a direction opposite the planet's rotation. The general pattern of winds showed prograde rotation at high latitudes vs. retrograde rotation at lower latitudes. The difference in flow direction is thought to be a [...] "skin effect" [...] and not due to any deeper atmospheric processes. At 70° S latitude, a high-speed jet travels at a speed of 300m/s.|$|E

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} of solar surface convection have predicted {{the existence of}} <b>supersonic</b> horizontal <b>flows</b> in the photospheric granulation. Recently, the detection of such flows in data from the Hinode satellite was reported. We study <b>supersonic</b> granular <b>flows</b> in detail to understand their signatures in spectral lines and to test the observational detection method used to identify these flows in the Hinode observations. We perform time-dependent 3 D radiative MHD numerical simulations and synthesize the Fe i 6302 Å spectral lines at {{the resolution of the}} Hinode data for different viewing angles covering the center-limb variation. There is very large variation in the detailed shape of the emergent line profiles depending on the viewing angle and the particular flow properties and orientation. At the full simulation resolution the <b>supersonic</b> <b>flows</b> can even produce distinct satellite lines. After smearing to the Hinode resolution sufficient signature of supersonic motion remains. Our analysis shows that the detection method used to analyze the Hinode data is indeed applicable. However, the detection is very sensitive to ad hoc parameter choices and can also misidentify <b>supersonic</b> <b>flows...</b>|$|R
2500|$|At {{transonic}} speeds, {{the flow}} field around the object includes both sub- and supersonic parts. The transonic period begins when first zones of M > 1 flow appear around the object. In {{case of an}} airfoil (such as an aircraft's wing), this typically happens above the wing. <b>Supersonic</b> <b>flow</b> can decelerate back to subsonic only in a normal shock; this typically happens before the trailing edge. (Fig.1a) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{design of}} some air intakes for {{supersonic}} aircraft {{can be compared}} to that of supersonic wind tunnels, and requires careful analysis in order to avoid unstarts. [...] At high supersonic speeds (usually between Mach 2 to 3), intakes with internal compression are designed to have <b>supersonic</b> <b>flow</b> downstream of the air intake's capture plane. If the mass flow across the intake's capture plane does not match the downstream mass flow at the engine, the intake will unstart. This can cause violent, temporary loss of control until the intake is restarted.|$|E
2500|$|Using a more {{theoretical}} definition, unstart is the supersonic choking {{phenomenon that}} occurs in ducts with an upstream mass flow greater than the downstream mass flow. [...] Unsteady flow results as the mismatch in massflow can not gradually propagate upstream in contrast to subsonic flow. [...] Instead, in <b>supersonic</b> <b>flow,</b> the mismatch is carried forward behind a 'normal' or terminal shock wave that abruptly causes the gas flow to become subsonic. [...] The resulting normal shock wave then propagates upstream at an effective acoustic velocity until the flow mismatch reaches equilibrium.|$|E
40|$|There {{is a lack}} of firm {{conclusions}} or {{recommendations in}} the open literature to guide laser velocimeter (LV) users in minimizing the uncertainty of LV data acquired in confined <b>supersonic</b> <b>flows</b> with steep velocity gradients. This fact led the NASA Lewis Research Center (LeRC) in Cleveland (Ohio, USA), and the Institute of Propulsion Technology of DLR in Cologne (Germany) to a joint research effort to improve reliability of LV measurements in <b>supersonic</b> <b>flows.</b> Over the years, NASA and DLR have developed different expertise in laser velocimetry, using different LV systems: Doppler and two-spot (L 2 F).

2500|$|<b>Supersonic</b> <b>flow</b> behaves very {{differently}} from subsonic flow. Fluids react {{to differences in}} pressure; pressure changes are how a fluid is [...] "told" [...] to respond to its environment. Therefore, since sound is in fact an infinitesimal pressure difference propagating through a fluid, {{the speed of sound}} in that fluid can be considered the fastest speed that [...] "information" [...] can travel in the flow. This difference most obviously manifests itself {{in the case of a}} fluid striking an object. In front of that object, the fluid builds up a stagnation pressure as impact with the object brings the moving fluid to rest. In fluid traveling at subsonic speed, this pressure disturbance can propagate upstream, changing the flow pattern ahead of the object and giving the impression that the fluid [...] "knows" [...] the object is there by seemingly adjusting its movement and is flowing around it. In a <b>supersonic</b> <b>flow</b> however, the pressure disturbance cannot propagate upstream. Thus, when the fluid finally reaches the object it strikes it and the fluid is forced to change its properties – temperature, density, pressure, and Mach number—in an extremely violent and irreversible fashion called a shock wave. The presence of shock waves, along with the compressibility effects of high-flow velocity (see Reynolds number) fluids, is the central difference between the supersonic and subsonic aerodynamics regimes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{equation}} above {{can be used}} to plot the Fanno line, {{which represents}} a locus of states for given Fanno flow conditions on an H-ΔS diagram. [...] In the diagram, the Fanno line reaches maximum entropy at H= 0.833 and the flow is choked. [...] According to the Second law of thermodynamics, entropy must always increase for Fanno flow. [...] This means that a subsonic flow entering a duct with friction will have an increase in its Mach number until the flow is choked. [...] Conversely, the Mach number of a <b>supersonic</b> <b>flow</b> will decrease until the flow is choked. [...] Each point on the Fanno line corresponds with a different Mach number, and the movement to choked flow is shown in the diagram.|$|E
2500|$|As {{aircraft}} speed increased, designers began to encounter challenges associated with air compressibility at speeds near {{or greater than}} the speed of sound. [...] The differences in air flows under such conditions leds to problems in aircraft control, increased drag due to shock waves, and the threat of structural failure due to aeroelastic flutter. [...] The ratio of the flow speed to the speed of sound was named the Mach number after Ernst Mach {{who was one of the}} first to investigate the properties of <b>supersonic</b> <b>flow.</b> William John Macquorn Rankine and Pierre Henri Hugoniot independently developed the theory for flow properties before and after a shock wave, while Jakob Ackeret led the initial work of calculating the lift and drag of supersonic airfoils.
