5000|$|For {{patients}} {{who do not}} adequately respond to dietary fiber, osmotic laxatives such as polyethylene glycol, sorbitol, and lactulose can help avoid [...] "cathartic colon" [...] which {{has been associated with}} stimulant laxatives. [...] Among the osmotic laxatives, doses of 17-26 g/d of polyethylene glycol have been well studied. Lubiprostone (Amitiza) is a gastrointestinal agent used for the treatment of idiopathic chronic constipation and constipation-predominant IBS. It is well tolerated in adults, including elderly patients. As of July 20, 2006, lubiprostone had not been studied in pediatric patients. Lubiprostone is a bicyclic fatty acid (prostaglandin E1 derivative) that acts by specifically activating ClC-2 chloride channels on the apical aspect of gastrointestinal epithelial cells, producing a chloride-rich fluid secretion. These secretions soften the stool, increase motility, and promote spontaneous bowel movements. Unlike many laxative products, lubiprostone does not show signs of tolerance, dependency, or altered <b>serum</b> <b>electrolyte</b> concentration.|$|E
5000|$|Currently {{there is}} no {{curative}} treatment for KSS. Because it is a rare condition, there are only case reports of treatments with very little data to support their effectiveness. Several promising discoveries have been reported which may support the discovery of new treatments with further research. Satellite cells are responsible for muscle fiber regeneration. It has been noted that mutant mtDNA is rare or undetectable in satellite cells cultured from patients with KSS. Shoubridge et al. (1997) asked the question whether wildtype mtDNA could be restored to muscle tissue by encouraging muscle regeneration. In the forementioned study, regenerating muscle fibers were sampled at the original biopsy site, and {{it was found that}} they were essentially homoplasmic for wildtype mtDNA. [...] Perhaps with future techniques of promoting muscle cell regeneration and satellite cell proliferation, functional status in KSS patients could be greatly improved.One study described a patient with KSS who had reduced serum levels of coenzyme Q10. Administration of 60-120 mg of Coenzyme Q10 for 3 months resulted in normalization of lactate and pyruvate levels, improvement of previously diagnosed first degree AV block, and improvement of ocular movements.A screening ECG is recommended in all patients presenting with CPEO. In KSS, implantation of pacemaker is advised following the development of significant conduction disease, even in asymptomatic patients.Screening for endocrinologic disorders should be performed, including measuring serum glucose levels, thyroid function tests, calcium and magnesium levels, and <b>serum</b> <b>electrolyte</b> levels. Hyperaldosteronism is seen in 3% of KSS patients.|$|E

In female rats, hyperpotassemia, hypochloremia and alkalosis were also observed, but hyperpotassemia was less marked than that seen in male rats.

40|$|To {{alter the}} natural history of {{congestive}} heart failure and change the poor prognosis for patients with this condition will require new insights into its pathogenesis as well as the development of strategies to alter the neurohumeral and <b>serum</b> <b>electrolyte</b> abnormalities associated with congestive heart failure, which are often exaggerated by current therapeutic approaches. Although improvement in hemodynamics and exercise tolerance in patients with congestive heart failure remains important, the emphasis of therapeutic goals should be shifted to prevent further cardiac deterioration and to prevent sudden cardiac death. The use of converting enzyme inhibitors holds promise for a beneficial effect on the altered hemodynamic, electrolyte, and neurohumeral abnormalities associated with congestive heart failure. If further prospective randomized trials confirm the beneficial effects of these agents in reducing the mortality rate among patients with congestive heart failure, it is likely that these benefits will have stemmed from their effects on neurohumeral factors and <b>serum</b> <b>electrolyte</b> abnormalities rather than from their effects on hemodynamics...|$|E

This study aimed to determine the cumulative incidence of renal tubular dysfunction and <b>serum</b> <b>electrolyte</b> imbalances among children and young adults with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassaemia on deferasirox and study their intermediate term outcomes. Mean age was 15. 89 years (range: 2. 6 - 24. 10 years). Nine (50. 0 %) patients were on deferasirox, three (16. 7 %) were on deferoxamine, two (11. 1 %) were on deferiprone, and four (22. 2 %) were on combination deferiprone and deferoxamine. Twelve (66. 7 %) patients had renal tubular dysfunction, defined by elevated urine - 2 microglobulin, of whom nine were on deferasirox. Eight patients (44. 4 %) had concomitant <b>serum</b> <b>electrolyte</b> imbalance, all of whom were on deferasirox. Compared to those on other chelation regimens, patients on deferasirox were more likely to develop renal tubular dysfunction (OR 35. 3, p= 0. 009), hypokalaemia (OR 23. 2, p= 0. 015), hypophosphataemia (OR 57. 0, p= 0. 001), hypocalcaemia (OR 23. 2, p= 0. 015), and Fanconi syndrome (OR 15. 6, p= 0. 004).

40|$|Background: Venous blood {{sampling}} is usually performed using a tourniquet to help locate and define peripheral veins to achieve successful and safe venipuncture. Despite widespread usage of tourniquets for venipuncture by medical and laboratory staff, very few {{are aware of}} the effects of tourniquet application on laboratory parameters. In addition, definitive guidelines regarding when and how to use a tourniquet for {{blood sampling}} are lacking. The aim {{of the present study was}} to define the optimal sampling time after tourniquet removal to avoid adverse impact on laboratory analytes. Methods: Blood oxygen and carbon dioxide partial pressure, pH, oxyhemoglobin saturation (satO 2), hematological parameters, <b>serum</b> <b>electrolyte</b> concentrations, erythrocyte, deformability and aggregation, leukocyte activation and nitrite/nitrate concentrations obtained 180  s after tourniquet release were compared with baseline values for 10 healthy subjects. Results: Blood gases, hematological parameters and <b>serum</b> <b>electrolyte</b> levels were not affected by the application and removal of a tourniquet. However, there were significant decreases in erythrocyte deformability at 90, 120, 180  s, and increases in erythrocyte aggregation at 5 and 30  s following removal of the tourniquet. A significant increase in granulocyte respiratory burst at 60  s was observed, confirming leukocyte activation due to application of the tourniquet. There were no significant alterations of blood nitrite/nitrate levels. Conclusions: Our blood sampling technique which mimicked the application and release of a tourniquet indicated unaltered values for routine blood gases, hematological testing and <b>serum</b> <b>electrolyte</b> levels. Conversely, hemorheological measurements can be affected. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that tourniquet application should be avoided during blood sampling or, if this is not possible, the procedure should be well standardized and details of the sampling method should be reported.

The control rats received normal rat feed, while test animals were fed with three graded diet doses that contained Xylopia aethiopica at 1. 5 % w/w, 2. 5 % w/w and 5 % w/w. Both control and test animals received their food, plus drinking water, ad libitum for six weeks.
