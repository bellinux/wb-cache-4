5000|$|In {{secondary}} occlusal trauma, simply {{removing the}} [...] "high spots" [...] or <b>selective</b> <b>grinding</b> of the teeth will not eliminate the problem, because the teeth are already periodontally involved. After splinting the teeth {{to eliminate the}} mobility, {{the cause of the}} mobility (in other words, the loss of clinical attachment and bone) must be managed; this is achieved through surgical periodontal procedures such as soft tissue and bone grafts, as well as restoration of edentulous areas.

50|$|Some producers, {{in order}} to {{maximise}} product quality, choose to combine the traditional grinding method, the stone mill, with a modern decanter. This technique produces more <b>selective</b> <b>grinding</b> of the olives, reduces the malaxation time olive paste, and avoids the complicated cleaning of the olive press fibre disks. Because {{the use of the}} stone mill requires a loading and unloading phase, this extraction method is discontinuous, i.e., there are times when all the machinery is stopped, therefore it is generally not used on a large commercial scale, being applied only by small scale olive mills producing high quality olive oil.|$|E
50|$|In primary occlusal trauma, the cause, of the {{mobility}} was the excessive force being {{applied to a}} tooth with a normal attachment apparatus, otherwise known as a periodontally-uninvolved tooth. The approach should be to eliminate {{the cause of the}} pain and mobility by determining the causes and removing them; the mobile tooth or teeth will soon cease exhibiting mobility. This could involve removing a high spot on a recently restored tooth, or even a high spot on a non-recently restored tooth that perhaps moved into hyperocclusion. It could also involved altering one's parafunctional habits, such as refraining from chewing on pens or biting one's fingernails. For a bruxer, treatment of the patient's primary occlusal trauma could involve <b>selective</b> <b>grinding</b> of certain interarch tooth contacts or perhaps employing a nightguard to protect the teeth from the greater than normal occlusal forces of the patient's parafunctional habit. For someone who is missing enough teeth in non-strategic positions so that the remaining teeth are forced to endure a greater per square inch occlusal force, treatment might include restoration with either a removable prosthesis or implant-supported crown or bridge.|$|E

30|$|The {{difference}} in the density and activity of earthworms in the different treatment plots compared to control might {{be responsible for the}} alteration in the percentage of soil separates viz. sand, silt and clay. Dramatic rise in earthworm densities coupled with remarkable increase in clay contents and decrease in sand contents in T 3 plots compared to T 0 and other treatment plots are noticeable. Curry (1998) reported a positive relationship between clay content and earthworm abundance and a negative relationship between earthworm population and sand content of the soil. This alteration in the amount of soil separates is possibly due to <b>selective</b> feeding, physical <b>grinding</b> by gizzard and redistribution of soil particles by means of earthworms casting activities (Edwards and Bohlen 1996). Thus it appears that earthworms have an important role in determining soil textural classes. Panigrahi et al.

5000|$|This is the {{adjustment}} or reorganizing {{of the existing}} occlusion, {{carried out in the}} belief that this will redistribute forces evenly across the dental arches or achieve a more favorable position of the condyles in the fossae, which is purported to lessen tooth wear, bruxism and TMD, but this is controversial. These techniques are sometimes termed [...] "occlusal rehabilitation" [...] or [...] "occlusal equilibration". At its simplest, occlusal adjustment involves <b>selective</b> <b>grinding</b> (with a dental drill) of the enamel of the occlusal surfaces of teeth, with the aim of allowing the upper teeth to fit with the lower teeth in a more harmonious way. However, there is much disagreement between proponents of these techniques on most of the aspects involved, including the indications and the exact goals. Occlusal adjustment can also be very complex, involving orthodontics, restorative dentistry or even orthognathic surgery. Some have criticized these occlusal reorganizations as having no evidence base, and irreversibly damaging the dentition on top of the damage already caused by bruxism. A [...] "middle ground" [...] view of these techniques is that occlusal adjustment in most cases of TMD is neither desirable nor helpful as a first line treatment, and furthermore, with few exceptions, any adjustments should be reversible. However, most dentists consider this unnecessary overtreatment, with no evidence of benefit. Specifically, orthodontics and orthognathic surgery are not considered by most to be appropriate treatments for TMD. A systematic review investigating all the scientific studies carried out on occlusal adjustments in TMD concluded the following: [...] "There is an absence of evidence of effectiveness for occlusal adjustment. Based on these data occlusal adjustment cannot be recommended for the treatment or prevention of TMD.|$|E

In this article, we present work on polymer sorting using <b>selective</b> <b>grinding.</b> <b>Selective</b> <b>grinding</b> is an operation that consists in sorting polymers after shredding. Specific particle size distributions characterize each polymer in the output stream and these differences are used to recover certain polymers by sifting. This process is based on the brittle or ductile properties of polymers. The first results presented in this work concern the sorting of a mixture of polymers and polyolefins, which are chemically incompatible. The working method adopted includes three parts. In the first part, a stream of mixed polymers from the shredder residue (SR) of a treatment chain was characterized. The mixed stream was composed of different grades of Polypropylene and different grades of Polyethylene. Afterwards, based on the characterization data, <b>selective</b> <b>grinding</b> tests were carried out on a model mixture with virgin materials.

40|$|Introduction: The {{knowledge}} of dental occlusion {{should be considered}} the basic foundation to an excellent orthodontic practice. The patient's diagnose without the centric relation assessment can take the orthodontist to an unpleasant surprises. The use of rectangular archwires requires occlusal contacts been checked to decide what kind of the dental movement {{will be necessary to}} achieve the dental equilibrium and mainly to investigate if the movement will be possible. Considering the occlusal surfaces complexity, the occlusal adjustment by <b>selective</b> <b>grinding</b> should be performed during the orthodontic treatment to allow vertical dental movements reducing treatment's time. Occlusal interferences are responsible not only for biomechanics adverse effects, producing undesirable dental movements, but also for potential side effects such as excessive forces (occlusal trauma), leading to roots reabsorption. The occlusal adjustment is a determinant point on dental balance after the end of orthodontics treatments, where each posterior occlusal tooth contacts A and B, or B and C on buccolingual aspect, as well as the stoppers and equalizers contacts on mesiodistal direction must be achieved and well established.

40|$|Introduction. The {{influence}} of occlusal condition {{at the onset}} of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) has been strongly debated for many years and still is the source of controversy. Up to the eighties in the last century, the occlusal factors such as the presence of uncured malocclusions, discrepancies between intercuspal position and retruded contact position greater than two millimeters, retrusive and nonworking side interferences and loss of posterior teeth were considered to be the primary causes of TMD. Objective. The aim {{of this study was to}} estimate the role of occlusal factor in the etiology of craniomandibular dysfunction and therapeutic effects of irreversible occlusal therapy (occlusal equilibration) in patients with TMD. Methods. In the investigation we studied a group of 200 men and women. The average age of the selected patients was between 18 and 25 years. The purpose of TMD signs and symptoms was confirmed in every patient using a special functional analysis and evaluating the craniomandibular index (CMI) according to Fricton and Schiffman. The value of craniomandibular index was determined in the group of 15 patients with signs and symptoms of temporomandibular dysfunction. In the study groups occlusal equilibration (<b>selective</b> <b>grinding)</b> was performed according to Okeson using the central position of the mandible as the referent position in the occlusal therapy. The value of CMI was determined before and 30 days after occlusal equilibration. Results. The results of this study confirmed the significant reduction in the signs and symptoms of TMD after occlusal equilibration. The statistical elaboration of the differences between the values of CMI I (before treatment) and CMI II (30 days after treatment) revealed highly significant differences. The CMI I values in the group ranged between 0. 076 and 0. 346 with the mean value of 0. 188 ± 0. 082. The values of CMI II ranged between 0. 038 and 0. 19 with the mean value of 0. 038 ± 0. 053.

40|$|A {{major concern}} in {{dentistry}} {{is the correct}} distribution of occlusal forces to promote balance among {{the elements of the}} stomatognathic system. Occlusal trauma may develop in situations where the magnitude of the load exerted by occlusion exceeds the ability of the periodontium surrounding the involved teeth to resist and distribute the resulting forces without moving. A 41 -year-old female patient was referred to the Occlusion and Orofacial Pain Research Center at the School of Dentistry, Universidade Federal de Goiás, Brazil, with headache, temporomandibular joint pain, toothache, and bone resorption on the distal aspect of tooth # 33.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Published literature was searched through the PubMed and Cochrane Library electronic databases from 1966 to January 2005. The search {{was performed by}} an information specialist at the Swedish Council on Technology Assessment in Health Care. The inclusion criteria consisted of a follow-up period of at least 5 years postretention; randomized clinical trials, prospective or retrospective clinical controlled studies, and cohort studies; and orthodontic treatment including fixed or removable appliances, <b>selective</b> <b>grinding,</b> or extractions.

40|$|In thermal {{processing}} of oil shale in vertical retorts huge quantities {{of a solid}} waste – semicoke are formed. It {{has been shown that}} circulating fluidized bed combustion of semicoke could be a promising technology allowing utilization of its high residual energy potential. Tests in combustion of pure semicoke and semicoke with a small addition of oil shale (up to 20 %) were carried out using a fluidized bed device with a thermal capacity of 50 kWth. The main parameters of combustion process and the additional heat produced were determined and calculated. The experiments indicated that semicoke with low moisture content (below 10 %) could be burnt in fluidized bed without adding of oil shale. For the combustion of semicoke with higher moisture content (over 10 %) about 10 % of oil shale must be added. One possibility for utilizing residual carbon present in semicoke could also be production of carbon-rich materials in order to obtain, for example, activated carbon. A series of experiments accompanied by SEM X-Ray and EDAX analysis was carried out in order to elucidate the distribution of carbon and mineral part in semicoke and to find possibilities for their separation and subsequent enrichment. Different separation methods – <b>selective</b> <b>grinding</b> and subsequent screening, pneumatic separation and triboelectroseparation method were analyzed. It was shown that due to close integration of mineral and organic part in semicoke, the separation of carbon-rich ingredients by the methods used was not enough effective to obtain enriched products suitable for the production of activated carbon...|$|E
40|$|Part I of {{this study}} showed that washed and dried, {{shredded}} poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) (flake) obtained from curbside collection when Soxhlet extracted contained 26 semivolatile contaminants below the US FDA threshold of 215 ppb and six above this level. This paper reports the validation of the Soxhlet extraction technique by comparison with total dissolution with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The work was carried out for two of the three particle size ranges obtained by grinding the PET flake (300 - 425 and 425 - 700 &# 0956;m) and for the unground flake. Further validation was undertaken by comparison of contaminant levels determined by total dissolution with TFA and sonication with dichloromethane (DCM) using flake ground to the 0 - 300 &# 0956;m size range. The levels of contaminants increased with decreasing particle size range, but X-ray diffraction measurements of degrees of crystallinity were similar for each PET particle size range, thus showing that the differences in contaminant levels were not due to variable percentages of the amorphous material from the tops and bottoms of shredded bottles, relative to the amounts of crystalline PET from the mid-sections of the bottles. Hence, it was postulated that the variations in contaminant levels were due to <b>selective</b> <b>grinding</b> of the more highly contaminated surfaces, whilst the larger particles incorporated the less contaminated interior material. The grinding was also strongly selective with respect to the amorphous flake. Analysis of the segregated amorphous and crystalline flake phases indicated that many contaminants were similarly absorbed into both phases, whilst some were preferred by the amorphous PET and others were preferred by the crystalline PET...|$|E
40|$|Conclusions: The {{following}} prescriptions are advisable: tip 5 °, torque 8 ° and in-out 2. 5 for U 1; tip 9 °, torque 3 ° and in-out 3. 25 for U 3; tip 10 °, torque − 8 ° and in-out 3. 75 for U 4; and tip 5 °, torque − 8 ° and in-out 4 for U 5. Andrews' prescription {{is suitable}} for the lower jaw, except for at L 6. It is also advisable to execute <b>selective</b> <b>grinding</b> (1. 33 ± 0. 5 mm) and extrusion (0. 68 ± 0. 23 mm) on the upper canine during treatment, and the first premolar requires some intrusion (0. 56 ± 0. 30 mm). Background: The {{aim of this study}} was to provide clinical indications for the correct management of appliances in space closure treatment of patients with agenesis of the upper lateral incisors. Methods: Virtual setup for space closure was performed in 30 patients with upper lateral incisor agenesis. Tip, torque and in-out values were measured and compared with those of previous authors. Results: In the upper dentition, the tip values were comparable to those described by Andrews (Am J Orthod 62 (3) : 296 - 309, 1972), except for at the first premolars, which require a greater tip, and the first molars, a lesser tip. The torque values showed no differences except for at the canines, where it was greater, and the in-out values were between those reported by Andrews and those by Watanabe et al. (The Shikwa Gakuho 96 : 209 - 222, 1996) (except for U 3 and U 4) ...|$|E
