50|$|No foot rise: In {{descriptions}} of the footwork of step patterns it is abbreviated as NFR and means that the heel of the <b>support</b> <b>foot</b> remains {{in contact with the}} floor until the weight is transferred onto the other foot.

5000|$|However, Foot {{points out}} that {{although}} {{the book and the}} timing of its publication would be compatible with the claim for it as being a major factor, the claim that it caused change would be much harder to <b>support.</b> <b>Foot</b> says that [...] "there is no evidence at all for many of the claims that are made about Morire di Classe".|$|E
50|$|In partial weight {{transfer}} {{the center of}} gravity is shifted to project between the old and new support body part. In some dance moves, such as ball change, the force produced by pushing with the new supporting foot at the moment of the partial {{weight transfer}} makes it possible to lift the previous <b>support</b> <b>foot</b> for a short time, followed by the drop back onto the first supporting foot subject to the gravity force.|$|E
5000|$|A weight {{transfer}} or weight change is dancer's movement {{so that their}} weight is moved from one <b>supporting</b> <b>foot</b> (or <b>supporting</b> limb/body part) to another one fully or partially.|$|R
50|$|A fouetté turn (or fouetté en tournant) {{begins with}} the {{performer}} standing on one flat foot in plié (with knee bent). The working leg is extended and whipped around {{to the side and}} then, once extended to maximum turnout, bent and pulled in to a passe or retiré position. The foot beats behind the knee and then {{to the front of the}} knee of the supporting leg before extending back out to the front. At the same time, the <b>supporting</b> <b>foot</b> transitions to relevé (heel raised), in ballet often rising to en pointe (on toe tips). These movements create the angular momentum needed for one turn, which is executed by rotating in place on the <b>supporting</b> <b>foot.</b>|$|R
50|$|Tropoli: In {{place of}} the triplets, the dancer may step on full foot (count 1), tap other toe, raising {{supporting}} heel off floor (count &), sharply bring supporting heel down to floor (count 2), and tap other heel next to <b>supporting</b> <b>foot</b> (count &).|$|R
5000|$|Compression {{refers to}} further {{lowering}} through the bending of the knees in preparation of pushing off the foot {{into the next}} step. It {{is not to be}} confused with [...] "compression", which refers to hip action in Latin dances. The term [...] "compression" [...] is used to emphacise the fact that this lowering is not simply [...] "dropping down", but rather the straining of the leg muscles (in an analogy with the compression of a spring) simultaneously with going down. This serves both smooth arrival onto the next <b>support</b> <b>foot</b> and preparation of the next step.|$|E
50|$|Treatment of flat feet {{may also}} be {{appropriate}} if there is associated foot or lower leg pain, or if the condition affects the knees or the lower back. Treatment may include using orthoses such as an arch <b>support,</b> <b>foot</b> gymnastics or other exercises as recommended by a podiatrist/orthotist or physical therapist. In cases of severe flat feet, orthoses should be used through a gradual process to lessen discomfort. Over several weeks, slightly more material {{is added to the}} orthosis to raise the arch. These small changes allow the foot structure to adjust gradually, as well as giving the patient time to acclimatise to the sensation of wearing orthoses. Once prescribed, orthoses are generally worn {{for the rest of the}} patient's life. In some cases, surgery can provide lasting relief, and even create an arch where none existed before; it should be considered a last resort, as it is usually very time consuming and costly.|$|E
50|$|Just {{prior to}} the swing phase, the athlete should land on the {{supporting}} leg with the knee slightly flexed so as to absorb some of the impact and thereby stabilize the body for more effective motion of the kicking leg. The best position of the supporting leg {{has been found to}} be 5 to 10 cm to the side of the ball (left of the ball for a right-footed kicker, right of the ball for a left-footed kicker). Skilled athletes have a tendency toward a closer ball-to-support leg side position. For forward to back positioning, there is variability based on the desired action of the ball. Placing the support leg further behind the ball will produce a greater upward direction whereas placing the support leg closer to the ball will produce greater forward propulsion. Ball flight trajectory is dictated by the supporting foot’s position. The <b>support</b> <b>foot</b> should be positioned so as to be parallel to the intended direction of the ball. Other important body positioning to be aware of is to bend the upper body slightly forward over the ball.|$|E

40|$|To realize {{dynamically}} stable {{walking for}} a quadruped walking robot, {{the combination of}} the trajectory planning of the body and leg position (feedforward control) and the adaptive control using sensory information (feedback control) is indispensable. In this paper, we propose a new body trajectory, the 3 D sway compensation trajectory, for a stable trot gait; we show that this trajectory has a lower energy consumption than the conventional sway trajectory that we have proposed. Then, for the adaptive attitude control method during the 2 leg supporting phase, we consider four methods, that is, a) rotation of body along the diagonal line between <b>supporting</b> <b>feet,</b> b) translation of body along the perpendicular line between <b>supporting</b> <b>feet,</b> c) vertical swing motion of recovering legs, and d) horizontal swing motion of recovering legs; we then describe how we verify the stabilization efficiency of each method through computer simulation, stabilization experimentation, and experimenting in walking on rough terrain using the quadruped walking robot, TITAN-VIII...|$|R

40|$|Background: Speed and {{direction}} of the ball are key factors in successful soccer penalty kicks. The kinematics that contribute to the kick direction are unclear. Purpose: The {{purpose of the study was}} (1) to compare the differences in instep kick kinematics between left and right kick directions; (2) to determine the significant factors that predict kick direction. Method: Four digital video cameras (80 Hz) collected data from eleven experienced female soccer players during instep penalty kicks to the left and right. Video analysis software (Dartfish Team Pro 6. 0) was used to process and analyze the video files. Results: Paired t-tests indicated that several variables before ball contact were different. The linear regression included three variables (<b>support</b> <b>foot</b> orientation, <b>support</b> <b>foot</b> position behind the ball and approach angle) to best predict kick directions (R 2 = 75. 6 %, p <. 01). Conclusion: The results may be useful for goalkeepers to anticipate kick direction before ball contact to gain a better chance to save the penalty kick.

40|$|Kicking for {{distance}} in Australian Rules football {{is an important}} skill. Here, I examine technical aspects that contribute to achieving maximal kick distance. Twenty-eight elite players kicked {{for distance}} while being videoed at 500 Hz. Two-dimensional digitized data of nine body landmarks and the football were used to calculate kinematic parameters from kicking foot toe-off to the instant before ball contact. Longer kick distances were associated with greater foot speeds and shank angular velocities at ball contact, larger last step lengths, and greater distances from the ground when ball contact occurred. Foot speed, shank angular velocity, and ball position relative to the <b>support</b> <b>foot</b> at ball contact {{were included in the}} best regression predicting distance. A continuum of technique was evident among the kickers. At one end, kickers displayed relatively larger knee angular velocities and smaller thigh angular velocities at ball contact. At the other end, kickers produced relatively larger thigh angular velocities and smaller knee angular velocities at ball contact. To increase kicking distance, increasing foot speed and shank angular velocity at ball contact, increasing the last step length, and optimizing ball position relative to the ground and <b>support</b> <b>foot</b> are recommended...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{evaluate}} {{the correlation between the}} placement of the <b>support</b> <b>foot</b> on the ground and the precision of the shot: the placement of the <b>support</b> <b>foot</b> relative to the ball was supposed to {{have an effect on the}} shot precision for a given target. The goal was divided with a visual grid that enabled to identify six possible targets of the shot, high/low for vertical placement and left/center/right for horizontal placement. Skilied players were asked to perform repetitive penalty instep kicks in the soccer field with a defined target such as high/left or low/right. Ground reaction forces were recorded at the supporting leg by means of a force platform installed in a suitable board and the player’s movement was video recorded. The position of COP at the kick instant with respect to the ball and the average trajectory of COP on the platform turned out to be correlated with successful targeting in such a way that training procedures can be defined to improve the player coordination for precision shooting. Finally, differences between free kicking and kicking with a goalkeeper were recorded, thus enabling us to analyze a realistic player behavior in the study...|$|E

In this paper, we present a closedloop gait, as it was used at the RoboCup competition 2010.
