5|$|At sunrise on 25 July 1953 New Jersey {{was off the}} key port, {{rail and}} {{communications}} center of Hungnam, pounding coastal guns, bridges, a factory area, and oil storage tanks. She sailed north that afternoon, firing at rail lines and railroad tunnels as she made for Tanchon, where she launched a whaleboat {{in an attempt to}} spot a train known to run nightly along the coast. Her big guns were trained on two tunnels between which she hoped to catch the train, but in the darkness she could not <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of her six-gun salvo.|$|E
5|$|The {{advantages}} to this method were that bills were substantially cheaper, and unlike writs did not tie the plaintiff down; once the case came to court the bill could be amended to include any action or actions the plaintiff wanted to enforce. In addition, by avoiding the Chancery writ, {{the case was}} substantially cheaper. The result of this was substantial; between 1560 and 1640, the King's Bench's business rose tenfold. This period also saw a substantial broadening of the remedies available in the common law. The main remedy and method was action on the case, which justices expanded to encompass other things. In 1499 it enabled the enforcement of parol promises, which rendered Chancery subpoenas obsolete; later developments included the recovery of debts, suing for defamatory words (previously an ecclesiastical matter) and action on the case for trover and conversion. Most of this reform took place under Fineux CJ, who never lived to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of his work; it took over 100 years for the reforms to fully reverse the decline in business.|$|E
5|$|Jackson Niyomugao, {{at the age}} of 24, was {{the only}} Rwandian {{competitor}} in the London Games to have participated in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. He qualified the Games after receiving a wildcard from the Olympic Solidarity Committee which was announced in the week {{before the start of the}} Olympics and was the last Rwandan athlete to attain qualification. After being eliminated from the heat stages in the previous Olympic Games in Beijing Niyomugao said he wanted to win a medal in London and that if he had more support, he would possibly be able to swim quicker but hoped to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>results.</b> He was drawn in the second heat held on 2 August, finishing fourth out of seven swimmers, with a time of 27.38 seconds. He ranked ahead of Uganda's Ganzi Mugula (27.58 seconds) and Paul Edingue Ekane from Cameroon (27.87 seconds) but behind Ching Maou Wei of American Samoa (27.30 seconds) in a heat led by Abdourahman Osman from Djibouti (27.25 seconds). Overall Niyomugao finished 52nd out of 58 competitors overall, but did not progress to the semi-finals because her time was 5.11 seconds slower than the slowest swimmer who made the later stages.|$|E

The discussions included the most common worries about arousal or erection, pregnancy, contraception, infections, and diseases. Johanson easily covered such topics as BDSM, sex positions, sexuality trends, sex and age, and much more. The show also included a sex quiz, a sex poll where viewers could vote via the internet and <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> {{at the end of}} the episode, and included important sexual news and information before and after commercial breaks.|$|E
25|$|On May 21, the {{families}} attempted {{to put forward}} a writ of amparo and accused the government of violating their rights by putting unnecessary barriers and forcing them to visit Mexico City to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of the DNA samples. On May 24, {{the families}} pushed their case to Mexico's National Human Rights Commission (CNDH) to help them retrieve the DNA samples from the PGR in Jalisco. The CNDH told the lawyer that the families {{no longer had to}} go to Mexico City for the DNA samples and that they could do the procedures in Jalisco. The government was able to confirm the identity of 3 of the 8 civilians killed. They stated that their DNA samples matched those of the family members, but clarified that these people were killed in clashes with security forces on May 1 and not on May 19. The families of Villa Purificación contested the government's final decision, and stated that between May and May 19, dozens of people were killed in the town. They claimed that the Army safeguarded the morgues to prevent civilians from seeing the bodies and identifying them. On May 22, the families of the missing people returned to Villa Purificación.|$|E

500|$|King and the SCLC had {{recently}} {{been involved in a}} campaign to desegregate the city of Albany, Georgia, but did not <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> they had anticipated. [...] Described by historian Henry Hampton as a [...] "morass", the Albany movement lost momentum and stalled. King's reputation had been hurt by the Albany campaign, and he was eager to improve it. Determined not to make the same mistakes in Birmingham, King and the SCLC changed several of their strategies. In Albany, they concentrated on the desegregation of the city as a whole. In Birmingham, their campaign tactics focused on more narrowly defined goals for the downtown shopping and government district. These goals included the desegregation of Birmingham's downtown stores, fair hiring practices in shops and city employment, the reopening of public parks, {{and the creation of a}} bi-racial committee to oversee the desegregation of Birmingham's public schools. King summarized the philosophy of the Birmingham campaign when he said: [...] "The purpose of... direct action is to create a situation so crisis-packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation".|$|E

2500|$|After Salinger's {{death in}} 2010, Phyllis Westberg, who was Salinger's agent at Harold Ober Associates, stated that {{nothing has changed}} in terms of {{licensing}} film, television, or stage rights of his works. A letter written by Salinger in 1957 revealed that he was open to an adaptation of The Catcher in the Rye released after his death. He wrote: [...] "Firstly, {{it is possible that}} one day the rights will be sold. Since there's an ever-looming possibility that I won't die rich, I toy very seriously with the idea of leaving the unsold rights to my wife and daughter as a kind of insurance policy. It pleasures me no end, though, I might quickly add, to know that I won't have to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of the transaction." [...] Salinger also wrote that he believed his novel was not suitable for film treatment, and that translating Holden Caulfield's first-person narrative into voice-over and dialogue would be contrived.|$|E
2500|$|The {{continuing}} {{popularity of}} Star Wars and other science fiction franchises were relevant in cinematic CGI at this time, as Lucasfilm and Industrial Light & Magic {{became known as}} the [...] "go-to" [...] house by many other studios for topnotch computer graphics in film. Important advances in chroma keying ("bluescreening", etc.) were made for the later films of the original trilogy. Two other pieces of video would also outlast the era as historically relevant: Dire Straits' iconic, near-fully-CGI video for their song [...] "Money For Nothing" [...] in 1985, which popularized CGI among music fans of that era, and a scene from Young Sherlock Holmes the same year featuring the first fully CGI character in a feature movie (an animated stained-glass knight). In 1988, the first shaders - small programs designed specifically to do shading as a separate algorithm - were developed by Pixar, which had already spun off from Industrial Light & Magic as a separate entity - though the public would not <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of such technological progress until the next decade. In the late 1980s, SGI computers were used to create some of the first fully computer-generated short films at Pixar, and Silicon Graphics machines were considered a high-water mark for the field during the decade.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 21st century, downtown Silver Spring began to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of redevelopment. Several city blocks near City Place Mall were completely reconstructed to accommodate a new outdoor shopping plaza called [...] "Downtown Silver Spring." [...] New shops included national retail chains such as Whole Foods Market, a 20-screen Regal Theatres, Men's Wearhouse, Ann Taylor Loft, DSW Shoe Warehouse, Office Depot, and the now-closed Pier 1 Imports, as well as many restaurants, including Panera Bread, Red Lobster, Cold Stone Creamery, Fuddruckers, Potbelly Sandwich Works, Nando's Peri-Peri, and Chick-fil-a. A Borders book store was a popular spot until it closed when the chain went out of business; it was replaced by H. In addition to these chains, Downtown Silver Spring is home {{to a wide variety of}} family-owned restaurants representing its vast ethnic diversity. As downtown Silver Spring revived, its 160-year history was celebrated in a PBS documentary entitled Silver Spring: Story of an American Suburb, released in 2002. In 2003, Discovery Communications completed the construction of its headquarters and relocated to downtown Silver Spring from nearby Bethesda. The same year also brought the reopening of the Silver Theatre, as AFI Silver, under the auspices of the American Film Institute. Development continues with the opening of new office buildings, condos, stores, and restaurants. In 2015-16, the long-struggling City Place Mall underwent a complete renovation, had its name changed to Ellsworth Place, and brought in new tenants, including TJ Maxx, Ross Dress for Less (a re-opening original tenant), Michaels, Forever 21, and Dave & Buster's. The restoration of the old B Passenger Station was undertaken between 2000 and 2002, as recorded in the documentary film [...] In 2005 Downtown Silver Spring was awarded the Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence silver medal.|$|E
