5|$|The basal ganglia, {{also called}} basal nuclei, are {{a set of}} {{structures}} deep within the hemispheres involved in behaviour and movement regulation. The largest component is the striatum, others are the globus pallidus, the substantia nigra and the <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nucleus.</b> Part of the dorsal striatum, the putamen, and the globus pallidus, lie separated from the lateral ventricles and thalamus by the internal capsule, whereas the caudate nucleus stretches around and abuts the lateral ventricles on their outer sides.|$|E
25|$|The <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nucleus</b> is a diencephalic gray matter {{portion of}} the basal ganglia, and the only {{portion of the}} ganglia that {{produces}} an excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate. The role of the <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nucleus</b> is to stimulate the SNr-GPi complex and {{it is part of}} the indirect pathway. The <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nucleus</b> receives inhibitory input from the external part of the globus pallidus and sends excitatory input to the GPi.|$|E
25|$|Another {{gene therapy}} of PD {{involved}} insertion of the {{glutamic acid decarboxylase}} (GAD) into the <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nucleus.</b> GAD enzyme controls GABA productions. In Parkinson’s disease, the activity of both GABA efferents to the <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nucleus</b> and its target within the basal ganglia circuity are affected. This strategy used andeno-associated viral vectoe (AAV2) to deliver GAD to the <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nucleus.</b> The trial was done to compare the effect of bilateral delivery of AAV2-GAD into the <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nucleus</b> with bilateral sham surgery in patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease. The study showed the first success of randomised, double-blind gene therapy trial for a neurodegenerative disease and justified the continued development of AAV2-GAD for treatment of PD.|$|E
50|$|The {{projections}} of the external globus pallidus to the <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nuclei</b> causes these neurons to increase their firing rate, since the globus pallidus neurons are inhibited by medium spiny neurons. The <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nuclei</b> have excitatory projections to the internal globus pallidus thus causing the internal globus pallidus neurons to increase their inhibititory influence on SNr and VTh.|$|R
50|$|HD causes astrogliosis {{and loss}} of medium spiny neurons. Areas of the brain are {{affected}} according to their structure {{and the types of}} neurons they contain, reducing in size as they cumulatively lose cells. The areas affected are mainly in the striatum, but also the frontal and temporal cortices. The striatum's <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nuclei</b> send control signals to the globus pallidus, which initiates and modulates motion. The weaker signals from <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nuclei</b> thus cause reduced initiation and modulation of movement, resulting in the characteristic movements of the disorder, notably chorea.|$|R
50|$|Cortical {{excitement}} of medium spiny neurons {{causes them to}} inhibit external globus pallidus neurons. These tonically inhibiting neurons thus decrease their inhibitory influence on the internal globus pallidus and the <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nuclei.</b>|$|R
25|$|Target {{areas for}} DBS or lesions include the thalamus, the globus pallidus (the lesion {{technique}} being called pallidotomy), or the <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nucleus.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{causes of}} the {{majority}} of the above hyperkinetic movements can be traced to improper modulation of the basal ganglia by the <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nucleus.</b> In many cases, the excitatory output of the <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nucleus</b> is reduced, leading to a reduced inhibitory outflow of the basal ganglia. Without the normal restraining influence of the basal ganglia, upper motor neurons of the circuit tend to become more readily activated by inappropriate signals, resulting in the characteristic abnormal movements.|$|E
25|$|Typically {{caused by}} {{damage to the}} <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nucleus</b> or nuclei, hemiballismus {{movements}} are nonrhythmic, rapid, nonsuppressible, and violent. They usually occur in an isolated body part, such as the proximal arm.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBilateral <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nuclei</b> {{deep brain}} {{stimulation}} (DBS) {{has been shown to}} be effective in treating motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Numerous studies confirm the safety and efficacy of DBS. Complications of <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nuclei</b> DBS show a 1. 2 % risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. There are few studies concerning the benefits of rehabilitation after occurrence of intracerebral hemorrhage related to DBS. We report a patient who underwent an inpatient rehabilitation program because of complicated intracerebral hemorrhage after a DBS procedure. We observed significant improvement in locomotion and independence of daily activities after the program. We also review the current literature reporting complications following DBS...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} case {{history of a}} 75 -year-old woman with Parkinson's disease who {{developed}} severe cognitive problems after deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the bilateral <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nuclei</b> (STN). After a brief cognitive improvement, the patient gradually deteriorated until she developed full-blown dementia. We discuss the case {{with respect to the}} cognitive effects of STN DBS and the possible risk factors of dementia after STN DBS surgery...|$|R
50|$|In the {{indirect}} pathway of movement, excitation (e.g. cortical input to the basal ganglia) results in net inhibition of upper motor neurons. In this pathway the medium spiny neurons in the striatum project {{to the external}} segment of the globus pallidus. These neurons in turn project to the internal segment of the globus pallidus and to the <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nuclei</b> which forms a feedback loop to the internal globus pallidus.|$|R
25|$|Expression of QSER1 is seen {{at levels}} lower than 50% in many tissues. However, notable {{expression}} {{is seen in}} skeletal muscle, the appendix, trigeminal ganglia, cerebellum peduncles, pons, spinal cord, ciliary ganglion, globus pallidus, <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nucleus,</b> dorsal root ganglion, fetal liver, adrenal gland, ovary, uterus corpus, cardiac myocytes, the atrioventricular node, skin, pituitary gland, tongue, early erythroid progenitors, and tonsil.|$|E
25|$|The International Basal Ganglia Society (IBAGS) informally {{considers}} the basal ganglia {{to be made}} up of the striatum, the pallidum (with two nuclei), the substantia nigra (with its two distinct parts), and the <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nucleus,</b> whereas Terminologia anatomica excludes the last two. Some neurologists have included the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus as part of the basal ganglia, and some have also included the pedunculopontine nucleus.|$|E
25|$|In children, primary {{dystonia}} {{is usually}} inherited genetically. Secondary dystonia, however, is most commonly caused by dyskinetic cerebral palsy, due to hypoxic or ischemic {{injury to the}} basal ganglia, brainstem, cerebellum, and thalamus during the prenatal or infantile stages of development. Chorea and ballism {{can be caused by}} damage to the <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nucleus.</b> Chorea can be secondary to hyperthyroidism. Athetosis can be secondary to sensory loss in the distal limbs; this is called pseudoathetosis in adults but is not yet proven in children.|$|E
40|$|Preparing for a cued, speeded {{response}} induces a set {{of physiological}} changes. A review of the psychophysiology of preparation suggested that inhibition of action was an important process among the constellation of changes constituting attentive preparation. The current experiment combined event-related {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} and cardiac inter-beat interval measures in an experiment that compared preparing for a response, watching stimuli without responding, and responding in the absence of preparation. Ten college-aged participants were tested in an initial psychophysiological experiment followed by two scanning sessions during which reverse spiral imaging was performed concurrent with inter-beat interval measurement. Two analytic approaches were used to confirm blood oxygenation level dependent responses during preparation, and these converged to show inferior prefrontal and related <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nuclei</b> activity in the context of other known changes related to brain attentional networks. <b>Subthalamic</b> <b>nuclei</b> changes were related to the depth of preparatory cardiac deceleration. This pattern of findings suggests that preparation involves the activation of a complex inhibitory neural network implicating brain and autonomic nervous systems...|$|R
30|$|The central {{component}} {{is located in}} the periaqueductal grey, <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nuclei</b> (Hansen and Rosenberg 1993) among the brain stem respiratory center, phrenic nerve nuclei, reticular formation and hypothalamus. The central component for hiccups lies in the medulla and is thought to be entirely separate from the pathways involved in rhythmic breathing (Davis 1970). Dopamine, gamma-amino-butyric-acid (GABA), serotonin, glutamate, and glycine neurotransmitters can regulate this central mechanism. The hiccup arc has modulatory input from catecholaminergic and serotonergic afferents.|$|R
30|$|While no circumscript {{brain area}} is {{responsible}} for consciousness, the neurotopical localization {{can be found in}} the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS). Whenever this system is functionally impaired bilaterally, one must anticipate disturbances of consciousness ultimately attaining the degree of coma. The ARAS connects the thalamic and <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nuclei</b> with the reticular intermediary grey substance of the spinal cord. Here, the etiology and exact localization of the functional neuronal disturbance in the ARAS are not especially important: reversible metabolic CNS disease in the context of metabolic derangement is just as well possible as structural lesions along the thalamic loop structures.|$|R
25|$|Recent {{studies have}} found that adults who stutter have {{elevated}} levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine, and have thus found dopamine antagonists that reduce stuttering (see anti-stuttering medication below). Overactivity of the midbrain has been found {{at the level of the}} substantia nigra extended to the red nucleus and <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nucleus,</b> which all contribute to the production of dopamine. However, increased dopamine does not imply increased excitatory function since dopamine's effect can be both excitatory or inhibitory depending upon which dopamine receptors (labelled D1 – D5) have been stimulated.|$|E
25|$|To {{localize}} INMT, {{a qualitative}} leap is accomplished {{with use of}} modern techniques of molecular biology, and of immunohistochemistry. In humans, a gene encoding INMT is determined to be located on chromosome 7. Northern blot analyses reveal INMT messenger RNA (mRNA) to be highly expressed in rabbit lung, and in human thyroid, adrenal gland, and lung. Intermediate levels of expression are found in human heart, skeletal muscle, trachea, stomach, small intestine, pancreas, testis, prostate, placenta, lymph node, and spinal cord. Low to very low levels of expression are noted in rabbit brain, and human thymus, liver, spleen, kidney, colon, ovary, and bone marrow. INMT mRNA expression is absent in human peripheral blood leukocytes, whole brain, and in tissue from 7 specific brain regions (thalamus, <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nucleus,</b> caudate nucleus, hippocampus, amygdala, substantia nigra, and corpus callosum). Immunohistochemistry showed INMT {{to be present in}} large amounts in glandular epithelial cells of small and large intestines. In 2011, immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of INMT in primate nervous tissue including retina, spinal cord motor neurons, and pineal gland.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{pathways}} involving basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuitry, both {{of which}} originate in the neostriatum. The direct pathway projects to the internal globus pallidus (GPi) and to the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). These projections are inhibitory and {{have been found to}} utilize both GABA and substance P. The indirect pathway, which projects to the globus pallidus external (GPe), is also inhibitory and uses GABA and enkephalin. The GPe projects to the <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nucleus</b> (STN), which then projects back to the GPi and GPe via excitatory, glutaminergic pathways. Excitation of the direct pathway leads to disinhibition of the GABAergic neurons of the GPi/SNr, ultimately resulting in activation of thalamic neurons and excitation of cortical neurons. In contrast, activation of the indirect pathway stimulates the inhibitory striatal GABA/enkephalin projection, resulting in suppression of GABAerigc neuronal activity. This, in turn, causes disinhibition of the STN excitatory outputs, thus triggering the GPi/SNr inhibitory projections to the thalamus and decreased activation of cortical neurons. While deregulation of either of these pathways can disturb motor output, hyperkinesia is thought to result from overactivity of the direct pathway and decreased activity from the indirect pathway.|$|E

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: To provide {{recommendations}} to patients, physicians, {{and other health}} care providers on several issues involving deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson disease (PD). DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: An international consortium of experts organized, reviewed the literature, and attended the workshop. Topics were introduced at the workshop, followed by group discussion. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: A draft of a consensus statement was presented and further edited after plenary debate. The final statements were agreed on by all members. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Patients with PD without significant active cognitive or psychiatric problems who have medically intractable motor fluctuations, intractable tremor, or intolerance of medication adverse effects are good candidates for DBS. (2) Deep brain stimulation surgery is best performed by an experienced neurosurgeon with expertise in stereotactic neurosurgery who is working as part of a interprofessional team. (3) Surgical complication rates are extremely variable, with infection being the most commonly reported complication of DBS. (4) Deep brain stimulation programming is best accomplished by a highly trained clinician and can take 3 to 6 months to obtain optimal results. (5) Deep brain stimulation improves levodopa-responsive symptoms, dyskinesia, and tremor; benefits seem to be long-lasting in many motor domains. (6) <b>Subthalamic</b> <b>nuclei</b> DBS may be complicated by increased depression, apathy, impulsivity, worsened verbal fluency, and executive dysfunction in a subset of patients. (7) Both globus pallidus pars interna and <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nuclei</b> DBS {{have been shown to be}} effective in addressing the motor symptoms of PD. (8) Ablative therapy is still an effective alternative and should be considered in a select group of appropriate patients...|$|R
40|$|SummaryWe report three patients, {{who have}} thalamic lesion and {{secondary}} generalized epilepsy with generalized spike wave pattern. The first two patients have unilateral perinatal lesion, one with generalized tonic–clonic seizures on awakening {{the other with}} Landau–Kleffner-like syndrome. During {{the course of the}} disease both children developed electrical status epilepticus in slow wave sleep (ESES). The third patient has a dominantly unilateral thalamic tumor and epilepsy that mimics juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. All the patients have a lesion located in the inferior-medial-posterior part of the thalamus. The role of some thalamic and <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nuclei</b> in the generalized spike-wave electrical pattern patophysiology is discussed, with emphasis on the possible role of the inhibitory system from the zona incerta...|$|R
500|$|Treating motor {{symptoms}} with {{surgery was}} once a common practice, but since the discovery of levodopa, the number of operations has declined. Studies {{in the past few}} decades have led to great improvements in surgical techniques, so that surgery is again being used in people with advanced PD for whom drug therapy is no longer sufficient. Surgery for PD can be divided in two main groups: lesional and deep brain stimulation (DBS). Target areas for DBS or lesions include the thalamus, the globus pallidus [...] or the <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nucleus.</b> [...] Deep brain stimulation is the most commonly used surgical treatment, developed in the 1980s by Alim Louis Benabid and others. It involves the implantation of a medical device called a neurostimulator, which sends electrical impulses to specific parts of the brain. DBS is recommended for people who have PD with motor fluctuations and tremor inadequately controlled by medication, or to those who are intolerant to medication, as long as they do not have severe [...] problems. Other, less common, surgical therapies involve intentional formation of lesions to suppress overactivity of specific [...] areas. For example, pallidotomy involves surgical destruction of the globus pallidus to control dyskinesia.|$|E
2500|$|In {{terms of}} anatomy, the basal ganglia {{are divided into}} four {{distinct}} structures, depending on how superior or rostral they are (in other words depending on how close {{to the top of}} the head they are): [...] Two of them, the striatum and the pallidum, are relatively large; the other two, the substantia nigra and the <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nucleus,</b> are smaller. [...] In the illustration to the right, two coronal sections of the human brain show the location of the basal ganglia components. Of note, and not seen in this section, the <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nucleus</b> and substantia nigra lie farther back (posteriorly) in the brain than the striatum and pallidum.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{components}} of the basal ganglia– as defined functionally– are the striatum; both dorsal striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen) and [...] ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle), globus pallidus, ventral pallidum, substantia nigra, and <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nucleus.</b> Each of these components has a complex internal anatomical and neurochemical organization. The largest component, the striatum (dorsal and ventral), receives input from many brain areas beyond the basal ganglia, but only sends output to other {{components of the}} basal ganglia. The pallidum receives input from the striatum, and sends inhibitory output {{to a number of}} motor-related areas. The substantia nigra {{is the source of the}} striatal input of the neurotransmitter dopamine, which plays an important role in basal ganglia function. The <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nucleus</b> receives input mainly from the striatum and cerebral cortex, and projects to the globus pallidus.|$|E
40|$|Kernicterus is an {{uncommon}} cause of extrapiramidal disorders in childhood. Early symptoms of kernicterus which {{develop in the}} second or third day neonatally, are jaundice, lethargy, respiratory distress and poor feeding. Death may follow in the first few weeks in most cases. Survivors may develop mental retardation, hearing loss and hypotonia. Seldom, survivors with minor serebral damage may have normal IQ or may have learning disorders and late symptomps of choreoathetosis, dystonia, rigidity in limbs or paroxysmal dyskinesias may develop. In kernicterus, lesions due to hyperbilirubinemia are found in serebral regions like <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nuclei,</b> globus pallidum, thalamus and oculomotor and cochlear nuclei. Late onset of symptoms of kernicterus are rarely reported. In this case report; 10 year old girld with kernicterus which presented with dystonia is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Speaking, which {{naturally}} {{occurs in}} different modes or “tasks ” such as conversation and repetition, relies on intact basal ganglia nuclei. Recent {{studies suggest that}} voice and fluency parameters are differentially affected by speech task. In this study, the authors {{examine the effects of}} subcortical functionality on voice and fluency, comparing measures obtained from spontaneous and matched repeated speech samples. Method: Subjects with Parkinson’s disease who were being treated with bilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nuclei</b> were tested with stimulators ON and OFF. Results: The study found that a voice measure, harmonic to noise ratio, is improved in repetition and in the DBS-ON condition and that dysfluencies are more plentiful in conversation with little or variable influence of DBS condition. Conclusions: These findings suggest that voice and fluency are differentially affected by DBS treatment and that task conditions, interacting with subcortical functionality, influence motor speech performance...|$|R
40|$|With recent {{developments}} in MR acquisition at 7 T, smaller brainstem structures such as the red nuclei, substantia nigra and <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nuclei</b> can be imaged with good contrast and resolution. These structures have important roles both {{in the study of}} the healthy brain and in diseases such as Parkinson's disease, but few methods have been described to automatically segment them. In this paper, we extend a method that we have previously proposed for segmentation of the striatum and globus pallidus to segment these deeper and smaller structures. We modify the method to allow more direct control over segmentation smoothness by using a Markov random field prior. We investigate segmentation performance in three age groups and show that the method produces consistent results that correspond well with manual segmentations. We perform a vertex-based analysis to identify changes with age in the shape of the structures and present results suggesting that the method may be at least as effective as manual delineation in capturing differences between subjects...|$|R
2500|$|Additional {{structures}} that later became {{associated with the}} basal ganglia are the [...] "body of Luys" [...] (1865) (nucleus of Luys on the figure) or <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nucleus,</b> whose lesion was known to produce movement disorders. More recently, other {{areas such as the}} centromedian nucleus and the pedunculopontine complex have been thought to be regulators of the basal ganglia.|$|E
2500|$|Deep brain {{stimulation}} {{toward the}} ventral intermediate {{nucleus of the}} thalamus and potentially the <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nucleus</b> and caudal zona incerta nucleus {{have been shown to}} reduce tremor in numerous studies. [...] That toward the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus has been shown to reduce contralateral and some ipsilateral tremor along with tremors of the cerebellar outflow, head, resting state and those related to hand tasks; however, the treatment has been shown to induce difficulty articulating thoughts (dysarthria), and loss of coordination and balance in long-term studies. [...] Motor cortex stimulation is another option shown to be viable in numerous clinical trials.|$|E
2500|$|The (long) {{indirect}} pathway {{originates in}} the dorsal striatum and inhibits the GPe, resulting in disinhibition of the GPi {{which is then}} free to inhibit the thalamus. [...] This pathway consists of MSNs that express dopamine receptor D2, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1, and adenosine receptor A2a. [...] This pathway has been proposed to result in global motor inhibition(inhibition of all motor activity), and termination of responses. [...] Another shorter indirect pathway has been proposed, which involves cortical excitation of the <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nucleus</b> resulting in direct excitation of the GPe, and inhibition of the thalamus. [...] This pathway is proposed to result in inhibition of specific motor programs based on associative learning.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction Multiple system atrophy is a late, adult-onset α-synucleinopathy with no data on {{the effect}} of {{pregnancy}} on the disease course. Early stage multiple system atrophy can be difficult to distinguish from Parkinson's disease. Case presentation We describe the case of an Irish woman with parkinsonism starting at age 31, initially diagnosed as having dopa-responsive, idiopathic Parkinson's disease, who successfully delivered a full-term child at age 35. Her pregnancy was complicated by severe orthostatic hypotension and motor fluctuations. Two years post-partum, she underwent bilateral <b>subthalamic</b> <b>nuclei</b> deep brain stimulation for intractable motor fluctuations and disabling dyskinesia. After this treatment course she experienced deterioration of motor symptoms and death eight years after disease onset. Post-mortem neuropathological examination revealed striatonigral degeneration and α-synuclein-positive glial cytoplasmic inclusions in brain stem nuclei, basal ganglia and white matter tracts, consistent with a neuropathological diagnosis of multiple system atrophy. Conclusions Multiple system atrophy can affect women of child-bearing age and pregnancy may be associated with marked disease progression. </p...|$|R
40|$|Classification {{of human}} {{behavior}} is key to developing closed-loop Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) systems, which {{may be able to}} decrease the power consumption and side effects of the existing systems. Recent {{studies have shown that the}} Local Field Potential (LFP) signals from both <b>Subthalamic</b> <b>Nuclei</b> (STN) of the brain can be used to recognize human behavior. Since the DBS leads implanted in each STN can collect three bipolar signals, the selection of a suitable pair of LFPs that achieves optimal recognition performance is still an open problem to address. Considering the presence of synchronized aggregate activity in the basal ganglia, this paper presents an FFT-based synchronization approach to automatically select a relevant pair of LFPs and use the pair together with an SVM-based MKL classifier for behavior recognition purposes. Our experiments on five subjects show the superiority of the proposed approach compared to other methods used for behavior classification. Comment: IEEE Conf on ICASSP 201...|$|R
