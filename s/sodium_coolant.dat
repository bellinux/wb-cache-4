50|$|It {{was thought}} that breeder {{reactors}} could be as safe and reliable as light-water reactors, but safety issues are cited as a concern with fast reactors that use a <b>sodium</b> <b>coolant,</b> where a leak {{could lead to a}} sodium fire.|$|E
50|$|A {{public inquiry}} was {{launched}} in April 2004 to consider plans {{to set up a}} plant to incorporate the 5,500 tonnes of <b>sodium</b> <b>coolant</b> in 70,000 tonnes of concrete.

25|$|India is also {{planning}} to build fast breeder reactors using the thorium – Uranium-233 fuel cycle. The FBTR (Fast Breeder Test Reactor) in operation at Kalpakkam (India) uses Plutonium as a fuel and liquid <b>sodium</b> as a <b>coolant.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Unlike {{reactors}} {{that use}} relatively slow low energy (thermal) neutrons, fast-neutron reactors need nuclear reactor coolant {{that does not}} moderate or block neutrons (like water does in an LWR) so that they have sufficient energy to fission actinide isotopes that are fissionable but not fissile. The core must also be compact and contain as small amount of material that might act as neutron moderators as possible.

50|$|There is a {{potential}} for nuclear-powered Stirling engines in electric power generation plants. Replacing the steam turbines of nuclear power plants with Stirling engines might simplify the plant, yield greater efficiency, and reduce the radioactive byproducts. A number of breeder reactor designs use liquid <b>sodium</b> as <b>coolant.</b> If the heat is to be employed in a steam plant, a water/sodium heat exchanger is required, which raises some concern as sodium reacts violently with water. A Stirling engine {{eliminates the need for}} water anywhere in the cycle. This would have advantages for nuclear installations in dry regions.|$|R

In this work, we have reviewed the literature on corrosion of metals in liquid sodium and carbon dioxide.

25|$|A {{specific}} {{risk of the}} sodium-cooled fast reactor is related to using metallic <b>sodium</b> as a <b>coolant.</b> In case of a breach, sodium explosively reacts with water. Fixing breaches may also prove dangerous, as the cheapest noble gas argon {{is also used to}} prevent sodium oxidation. Argon, like helium, can displace oxygen in the air and can pose hypoxia concerns, so workers may be exposed to this additional risk. This is a pertinent problem as demonstrated by the events at the loop type Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor Monju at Tsuruga, Japan.|$|R

This heat is transferred from the reactor core via several independent circulation loops. Each comprises a primary sodium pump, two intermediate heat exchangers, a secondary sodium pump with an expansion tank located upstream, and an emergency pressure discharge tank. These feed a steam generator, which in turn supplies a condensing turbine that turns the generator.|$|E

50|$|For the {{breeding}} reaction to be positive, producing more fuel that it uses, the neutrons {{released from the}} core should retain {{as much energy as}} they can. Additionally, as the core is very compact, the heating loads are very high. These requirements both lead to the use of liquid <b>sodium</b> as a <b>coolant,</b> as this is both an excellent conductor of heat, as well as being largely transparent to neutrons. Sodium is also highly flammable, and careful design is needed to build a primary cooling loop that can be safely operated. Alternate designs use lead.|$|R
