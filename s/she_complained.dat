5|$|Mary became {{worried about}} losing {{authority}} and was having trouble with the finances in February 1534. <b>She</b> <b>complained</b> that the budget could not be balanced even during the times of peace. Charles assured {{her that she was}} doing her best.|$|E
5|$|With {{regards to}} her diet, the three researchers' {{interviews}} revealed {{that in the}} care home she said she always had a sweet (dessert) with every meal. <b>She</b> <b>complained</b> about the blandness of the food in the care home and, given a choice, would wish to order fried and spicy foods. She occasionally ("more than once") feasted on chocolate in her old age: sometimes over a kilogramme (2.2lb) of chocolate per week.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of her visions is {{problematic}} since {{the main source}} of information on this topic is the condemnation trial transcript in which she defied customary courtroom procedure about a witness' oath and specifically refused to answer every question about her visions. <b>She</b> <b>complained</b> that a standard witness oath would conflict with an oath she had previously sworn to maintain confidentiality about meetings with her king. It remains unknown to what extent the surviving record may represent the fabrications of corrupt court officials or her own possible fabrications to protect state secrets. Some historians sidestep speculation about the visions by asserting that her belief in her calling is more relevant than questions about the visions' ultimate origin.|$|E

6000|$|... "She {{does not}} always make herself very intelligible. <b>She</b> <b>complains</b> without telling you what <b>she</b> <b>complains</b> of. But <b>she</b> muttered {{something}} about artists which was not complimentary, and I suppose, therefore, {{that she has a}} suspicion. She stayed ever so late this morning, and we left the house together. She will ask some direct question to-night, or before long, and then there will be an end of it." ...|$|R
5|$|In 1969, she {{graduated}} with a Bachelor of Arts, with departmental honors in political science. After some fellow seniors requested that the college administration allow a student speaker at commencement, {{she became the first}} student in Wellesley College history to speak at the event. Her address followed that of commencement speaker Senator Edward Brooke. After her speech, she received a standing ovation that lasted seven minutes. She was featured in an article published in Life magazine, due to the response to a part of her speech that criticized Senator Brooke. She also appeared on Irv Kupcinet's nationally syndicated television talk show as well as in Illinois and New England newspapers. That summer, she worked her way across Alaska, washing dishes in Mount McKinley National Park and sliming salmon in a fish processing cannery in Valdez (which fired her and shut down overnight when <b>she</b> <b>complained</b> about unhealthful conditions).|$|E
5|$|Similar to the United Kingdom's position, {{judicial}} review in Singapore {{is confined to}} matters of public law, and the applicable tests are the source test and nature test. The Datafin decision was applied by the Singapore Court of Appeal in Public Service Commission v. Lai Swee Lin Linda (2001), where the respondent, an employee with the Land Office, had the probationary period of her employment extended without prior warning. Her employment contract was later terminated. <b>She</b> <b>complained</b> to various statutory bodies, and ultimately to the Public Service Commission ("PSC"), but was unsuccessful in having her employment reinstated. She then sought leave from the High Court to apply for {{judicial review}} against the PSC. In the course of its judgment, the Court of Appeal accepted that the source test {{is one of the}} tests that can be relied on to determine whether a decision by a body is amenable to judicial review. In addition, it noted that Datafin had held that the source test is not the only applicable test. However, the Court did not embark on a discussion of the nature test because it found that when the respondent's employer had made the decisions concerning her employment, it had acted pursuant to her contractual terms of service and had not exercised its statutory powers. Thus, the decisions were not susceptible to judicial review. It did not invariably follow that when a statutory body makes a decision it is exercising a statutory power.|$|E
25|$|Clearly, {{she was a}} great {{inspiration}} and support for her husband although <b>she</b> <b>complained</b> that in order to get her husband's attention when he was intently working on his animation, she had to stand in the doorway naked.|$|E

25|$|West {{suffered}} from failing eyesight {{and high blood}} pressure in the late 1970s, and she became increasingly frail. Her last months were mostly spent in bed, sometimes delirious, sometimes lucid, and <b>she</b> <b>complained</b> that she was dying too slowly. She died on 15 March 1983 and is buried at Brookwood Cemetery, Woking.|$|E
25|$|Devastated after Shelley's death, Mary {{returned}} to England. She paid for Clairmont {{to travel to}} her brother's home in Vienna where she stayed for a year, before relocating to Russia, where {{she worked as a}} governess from 1825 to 1828. The people she worked for treated her almost {{as a member of the}} family. Still, what Clairmont longed for most of all was privacy and peace and quiet, as <b>she</b> <b>complained</b> in letters to Mary Shelley.|$|E
25|$|Dion's wife Janine Krieber {{also drew}} some {{controversy}} in the 2008 campaign. <b>She</b> <b>complained</b> {{that she was being}} muzzled by the Liberals, though party officials denied it. Reportedly, insiders had concerns that the outspoken Krieber would not stick to the party line and take the focus away from Dion. Krieber also refused at last minute to introduce Dion at a women's event because she felt that the brief speech prepared for her by campaign headquarters was undignified.|$|E

25|$|The exact {{cause of}} Lokhvitskaya's death remains unknown. Her health started to {{deteriorate}} {{in the late}} 1890s: <b>she</b> <b>complained</b> of insomnia and violent nightmares, suffered from bouts of severe depression, and later from chronic and ever worsening stenocardia. In 1904 Lokhvitskaya's illness progressed; she was bedridden {{for most of the}} year, tortured by pain and anxiety. In the early days of summer 1905, the family moved her to Finland, where her condition improved slightly, but on return she was hospitalized.|$|E
25|$|The {{children}} in her charge were spoilt and often disobedient. She had great difficulty controlling them and had little success in instilling any education. She was not empowered to inflict punishment, and when <b>she</b> <b>complained</b> about their behaviour received no support, but was criticised for not being capable. The Inghams, dissatisfied with their children's progress, dismissed Anne. She returned home at Christmas, 1839, joining Charlotte and Emily, who had left their positions, and Branwell. The episode at Blake Hall was so traumatic that she reproduced it in almost perfect detail in her novel Agnes Grey.|$|E
25|$|The {{narrative}} {{evokes the}} first humans created by Roog {{with a female}} being the first, and the trials they had faced. It also evokes the name of Roog, regarded as the Omnipotence, whom through his paternal nature, acted as a good father and moved the woman to a more comfortable place when <b>she</b> <b>complained</b> about her discomfort. It shows that he is always available to his children. The appearance of the man initially surprised the woman, whom she named Ngoor (virile), yet, they later became companions and procreated.|$|E

25|$|Gale McGee was not {{the first}} senator to propose a summer break. In 1959 Margaret Chase Smith warned of the Senate’s {{increasing}} workload. It creates disorder, <b>she</b> <b>complained,</b> as well as “confused thinking, harmful emotions, destructive tempers, unsound and unwise legislation, and ill health with the very specter of death hanging over Members of Congress.” If that sounds dramatic, keep in mind that in the 1950s senators died in office {{at a rate of about}} two per year. Smith proposed an annual break from August to October, but the Senate ignored her words of caution.|$|E
25|$|During the war, Frederick {{joined the}} Prussian army and {{was part of}} the {{fighting}} under the command of Field Marshal Friedrich von Wrangel. He distinguished himself with his courageous valour in the Battle of Dybbøl (7–18 April 1864) that marked the defeat of Denmark by the Austro-Prussian coalition. Pleased with the German victory, Victoria expected the military success of her husband would encourage people to understand that she was the wife of the heir apparent. In a letter to Frederick, <b>she</b> <b>complained</b> of the constant criticism and being considered too British in Prussia and too Prussian in Great Britain.|$|E
25|$|Earlier in the year, Cabrini had {{declined}} to renew Philip's contract, citing repeated tardiness and alcohol-related issues, effectively firing her. Shortly after she had been informed of that decision, {{she went out to}} a bar with other Cabrini employees. The outing led to her spending the night in jail. <b>She</b> <b>complained</b> to police that a fellow intern touched her inappropriately during that time. The prosecutor who investigated the case dropped the sexual abuse charge and instead charged Philip with third-degree falsely reporting an incident, a misdemeanor under New York law. He offered to drop the charge if she recanted the original complaint, but she refused and was held overnight pending release.|$|E

25|$|The issue gained greater {{attention}} when Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak dodged {{questions about the}} alleged abduction of Manohara by the Malaysian prince as he met Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono in Jakarta on 23 April 2009. The mother of the missing model {{held a press conference}} at the National Commission on Violence Against Women in Jakarta. <b>She</b> <b>complained</b> that Malaysian authorities had stopped her going to Malaysia to check on her daughter's condition. The circumstances have been compared to the case of Altantuya Shaariibu. The Indonesian government demanded an explanation from the Malaysian government as to why an Indonesian woman was denied entry to see her daughter amid claims of abuse by her husband of Malaysian royalty.|$|E
25|$|However, an {{increasing}} number of reports circulated about friction in the marriage, with speculation that this may have been due to Alice's making do with less money than she had once been accustomed to. It was said that she was strongly interested in fame and fortune, and when household finances dwindled, <b>she</b> <b>complained</b> bitterly. Bunten wrote in her Life of Alice Barnham that, upon their descent into debt, she went on trips to ask for financial favours and assistance from their circle of friends. Bacon disinherited her upon discovering her secret romantic relationship with Sir John Underhill. He subsequently rewrote his will, which had previously been very generousleaving her lands, goods, and incomeand instead revoked it all.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of July 6, <b>she</b> <b>complained</b> to the police that, after a {{domestic}} dispute, her husband had taken their son from the marital residence, and when the police reached the Randolph house, she told them {{that her husband was}} a cocaine user whose drug use habit had caused the family financial troubles. She mentioned the marital problems, saying that she and their son had only recently returned after a several weeks' stay with her parents. Shortly after the policemen arrived, Scott Randolph returned, explaining to them that he had removed their son to a neighbor's house, worried that his wife might again take the boy out of the U.S.; Scott Randolph denied using cocaine, and countered that it was his wife, Janet, who used illegal drugs and abused alcohol.|$|E
