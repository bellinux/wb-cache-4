5|$|It's {{about how}} people take drugs to connect to God or {{to a higher level}} of consciousness. I keep saying, 'Plugging into the matrix'. If you get high, you can do that, which is why a lot of people drop acid or do drugs, because they want to get closer to God. But there's going to be a short circuit, and that's the {{illusion}} of drugs, because they give you the illusion of getting closer to God, but ultimately they kill you. They destroy you. I mean, I tried everything once, but as soon as I was high, I <b>spent</b> <b>my</b> time drinking tons of water {{to get it out of}} my system. As soon as I was high, I was obsessed with flushing it out of me. I was like, 'OK, I'm done now'.|$|E

500|$|Jean MacCurdy {{said that}} How I <b>Spent</b> <b>My</b> Vacation {{makes fun of}} summer {{vacations}} by mocking [...] "the boredom of summer {{and some of those}} horrible car trips" [...] (an issue that was first explored in National Lampoon's Vacation). [...] In the film, the Hampton family car trip is very taxing for Plucky Duck; he is disgusted by the family and is nearly killed by an escaped lunatic that the family mistakes for a hitchhiker (He happens to be a caricature of Jason Voorhees). [...] The film's fictional theme park, [...] "HappyWorldLand", is a spoof of Disneyland. The film also parodies the THX logo and Deep Note when Fowlmouth and Shirley are at the movie theater.|$|E

[...] Warner Bros. discussed with executive producer Steven Spielberg whether the film should be released in theaters, but Spielberg insisted on a direct-to-video release. [...] Spielberg said that he wanted to make the film a direct-to-video release because [...] "animated features are ideally suited for the repeat viewing," [...] a factor he found important to the genre's appeal to those watching animated films at home. In an interview for the Los Angeles Times, executive in charge of production Jean MacCurdy did not specify the budget of the film, but stated that it was far more costly than episodes of Tiny Toon Adventures. [...] According to Hal Erickson's Television Cartoon Shows: an Illustrated Encyclopedia, the budget of the average Tiny Toon Adventures episode was approximately $350,000.|$|E

500|$|The {{band was}} given a small budget to film the music video. McIlrath remarked that the band {{did not want to}} make a video that felt [...] "really cheesy or overproduced", and instead wanted to {{incorporate}} the song's message. The night before filming began, the band performed at a local venue, and asked the audience members to star in the video; several audience members came the following day. The subway car featured in the video continued to make its regular stops, while the band and the actors performed. During one scene in the video, the vandals sneak into the local zoo, and deface a tiger cage with a sticker that says [...] "I've <b>spent</b> <b>my</b> entire life trapped in a cage". The zoo had not given permission for the band to film the tiger cage, out of fear it would damage their reputation. The filming crew chose to instead sneak into the zoo at night to film the scene.|$|E
500|$|Residente o Visitante was {{recorded}} in various countries, as the band was on tour during {{the making of the}} album. [...] Residente explained that the group did not feel any pressure to compete with the success of Calle 13, and felt that the recording of Residente o Visitante was a smoother process than the first: [...] "The main difference for us this time around was that we had more opportunities, more tools and more money. We were also on tour at the same time, unlike the first. I <b>spent</b> <b>my</b> time writing during the travels, while my brother would write the music." [...] Residente was invited by La Mala Rodriguez to come to Spain to collaborate on a song. [...] He agreed, as he greatly admired La Mala's work, and the two met for drinks where they discussed the kind of song they wanted to create before going to the studio to record what would later become [...] "Mala Suerta Con el 13".|$|E
500|$|Despite this, much of Scully's work on {{the show}} also {{received}} critical praise. Scully won five Primetime Emmy Awards {{for his work on}} The Simpsons, while Entertainment Weekly cited [...] "How I <b>Spent</b> <b>My</b> Strummer Vacation" [...] as the show's 22nd best episode. Robert Canning of IGN also gave the episode a positive review, something he also did for [...] "Behind the Laughter" [...] and [...] "Trilogy of Error", which aired during season 12. He called the latter: [...] "one extremely enjoyable misadventure. The Simpsons may have peaked in the '90s, but that doesn't mean the eight years since haven't delivered their share of quality episodes. This was one of them." [...] Martin said that he does not understand the criticism against Scully, and that he thinks the criticism [...] "bothered , and still bothers him, but he managed to not get worked up over it." [...] Ortved noted in his book that blaming a single show runner for what some perceive as the lowering quality of the show [...] "is unfair." [...] When asked in 2007 how the series' longevity is sustained, Scully joked, [...] "Lower your quality standards. Once you've done that you can go on forever." ...|$|E
