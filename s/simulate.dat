The method includes using a <b>simulated</b> machine that <b>simulates</b> a faulted actual machine, {{and using a}} <b>simulated</b> controller that <b>simulates</b> an actual controller. A multi-objective optimization process is performed, based on specified control settings for the <b>simulated</b> controller and specified operational scenarios for the <b>simulated</b> machine controlled by the <b>simulated</b> controller, to generate a Pareto frontier-based solution space relating performance of the <b>simulated</b> machine to settings of the <b>simulated</b> controller, including adjustment to the operational scenarios to represent a fault condition of the <b>simulated</b> machine. Control settings of the actual controller are adjusted, represented by the <b>simulated</b> controller, for controlling the actual machine, represented by the <b>simulated</b> machine, {{in response to a}} fault condition of the actual machine, based on the Pareto frontier-based solution space, to maximize desirable operational conditions and minimize undesirable operational conditions while operating the actual machine in a region of the solution space defined by the Pareto frontier...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{discovered}} that mouse oocyte maturation was inhibited by <b>simulated</b> microgravity via disturbing spindle organization. We cultured mouse oocytes under microgravity condition <b>simulated</b> by NASA’s rotary cell culture system, examined the maturation rate and observed the spindle morphology (organization of cytoskeleton) during the mouse oocytes meiotic maturation. While the rate of germinal vesicle breakdown did not differ between 1 g gravity and <b>simulated</b> microgravity, rate of oocyte maturation decreased significantly in <b>simulated</b> microgravity. The rate of maturation was 8. 94 % in <b>simulated</b> microgravity and was 73. 0 % in 1 g gravity. The {{results show that the}} maturation of mouse oocytes in vitro was inhibited by the <b>simulated</b> microgravity. The spindle morphology observation shows that the microtubules and chromosomes can not form a complete spindle during oocyte meiotic maturation under <b>simulated</b> microgravity. And the disorder of c-tubulin may partially result in disorganization of microtubules under <b>simulated</b> microgravity. These observations suggest that the meiotic spindle organization is gravity dependent. Although the spindle organization was disrupted by <b>simulated</b> microgravity, the function and organization of microfilaments were not pronouncedly affected by <b>simulated</b> microgravity. And we found that <b>simulated</b> microgravity induced oocytes cytoplasmic blebbing via an unknown mechanism.

The algorithms are enhanced by combining variants of the <b>simulated</b> annealing technique with other algorithm {{concepts such as}} (i) knowledge exploitation and (ii) parallelism. Four configurations of <b>simulated</b> annealing algorithms are devised and engaged to solve an instance of a process planning problem in reconfigurable manufacturing systems.
