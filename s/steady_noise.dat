An audio signal such as music or speech is broken up into many frequency bands by a collection of overlapping band-pass filters, and if the signal amplitude in any one band is lower than a preset threshold, then that band is eliminated from the final sound. This greatly reduces perceptible background noise because only the frequency components of the noise that are within the gated passbands survive.|$|E

The stimuli were unfiltered or were low-pass (LP) (1200 Hz cutoff) or high-pass (HP) (1500 Hz cutoff) filtered. The cutoff frequencies {{were selected to}} produce equal performance in both LP and HP conditions in <b>steady</b> <b>noise</b> and to limit access to the temporal fine structure of resolved harmonics in the HP conditions. Masking release, or the improvement in performance between the <b>steady</b> <b>noise</b> and single-talker interference, was substantial with no filtering. Under LP and HP filtering, masking release was roughly equal but was much less than in unfiltered conditions. When the average F 0 of the interferer was shifted {{lower than that of}} the target, similar increases in masking release were observed under LP and HP filtering. Similar LP and HP results were also obtained for the speech-modulated-noise masker. The findings are not consistent with the idea that pitch conveyed by the temporal fine structure of low-order harmonics plays a crucial role in masking release. Instead, any reduction in speech redundancy, or manipulation that increases the target-to-masker ratio necessary for intelligibility to beyond around 0 dB, may result in reduced masking release...|$|E

The hearing thresholds of the groups were measured by a puretone audiometer three times in two workdays.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has demonstrated reduced speech recognition of normal hearing listeners when speech is presented at higher-than-normal levels (e. g., above conversational speech levels), particularly {{in the presence of}} speech-shaped background noise. The present study examined the interactive effects of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), noise level and filtering on word recognition in noise. Speech recognition for 10 young adults with normal hearing was assessed for broadband, highpass and lowpass filtered speech (CF 1. 6 kHz) at three noise levels (62, 72 and 82 dBA). The interfering noise conditions were steady talker spectrum matched noise, and 16 Hz interrupted noise with a duty cycle of 50 %. The SNRs for the broadband conditions in <b>steady</b> <b>noise</b> were - 12, - 9, - 6, - 3 and 0 dB and SNRs 0, 3 and 6 dB were selected for the highpass and lowpass conditions. In interrupted noise, the SNRs for the broadband conditions were - 30, - 24, - 18, - 12 and - 6 dB and for the highpass and lowpass conditions, the SNRs were - 18, - 9, 0 and 6 dB. For all conditions, speech recognition performance increased with increase in SNR, except for the lowpass filtered words presented in <b>steady</b> <b>noise.</b> At the same SNR, word recognition performance in interrupted noise differed significantly from performance in <b>steady</b> <b>noise</b> across noise levels. For broadband filtered words presented in <b>steady</b> <b>noise,</b> performance slightly decreased at higher SNRs (0, - 3 dB) with increasing noise level. In interrupted noise, performance increased with increasing noise level for all SNRs, with significant interactions between SNR and level. Lowpass filtered speech was more difficult to recognize than highpass filtered speech and increasing the level of lowpass filtered speech at the same SNR did not improve speech recognition...|$|E

40|$|Cochlear-implant (CI) {{listeners}} generally {{perform better}} when listening to speech in steady-state noise than in fluctuating maskers, {{and the reasons}} for that are unclear. The present study presents a new hypothesis for the observed absence of release from masking. When listening to speech in fluctuating maskers (e. g., competing talkers), CI users cannot fuse the pieces of the message over temporal gaps because they are not able to perceive reliably the acoustic landmarks introduced by obstruent consonants (e. g., stops). These landmarks are evident in spectral discontinuities associated with consonant closures and releases and are posited to aid listeners determine word∕syllable boundaries. To test this hypothesis, normal-hearing (NH) listeners were presented with vocoded (6 – 22 channels) sentences containing clean obstruent segments, but corrupted (by <b>steady</b> <b>noise</b> or fluctuating maskers) sonorant segments (e. g., vowels). Results indicated that NH listeners performed better with fluctuating maskers than with <b>steady</b> <b>noise</b> even when speech was vocoded into six channels. This outcome suggests that having access to the acoustic landmarks provided by the obstruent consonants enables listeners to integrate effectively pieces of the message glimpsed over temporal gaps into one coherent speech stream...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{potential}} advantages, both theoretical and applied, of preserving low-frequency acoustic hearing in cochlear implant patients. Several hypotheses are presented that predict that residual low-frequency acoustic hearing along with electric stimulation for high frequencies will provide an advantage over traditional long-electrode cochlear implants for the recognition of speech in competing backgrounds. A simulation experiment in normal-hearing subjects demonstrated a clear advantage for preserving low-frequency residual acoustic hearing for speech recognition in a background of other talkers, but not in <b>steady</b> <b>noise.</b> Three subjects with an implanted "short-electrode" cochlear implant and preserved low-frequency acoustic hearing were also tested on speech recognition in the same competing backgrounds and compared to a larger group of traditional cochlear implant users. Each of the three short-electrode subjects performed better than any of the traditional long-electrode implant subjects for speech recognition in a background of other talkers, but not in <b>steady</b> <b>noise,</b> in general agreement with the simulation studies. When compared to a subgroup of traditional implant users matched according to speech recognition ability in quiet, the short-electrode patients showed a 9 -dB advantage in the multitalker background. These experiments provide strong preliminary support for retaining residual low-frequency acoustic hearing in cochlear implant patients. The results are consistent with the idea that better perception of voice pitch, which can aid in separating voices in a background of other talkers, was responsible for this advantage...|$|E

40|$|D-methionine (D-met) has {{demonstrated}} otoprotection from noise-, aminoglycoside-, and cisplatin-induced hearing loss in animal studies. As a result, D-met is currently progressing through translational 2 ̆ 2 bench to bedside 2 ̆ 2 research. However, D-met 2 ̆ 7 s exact otoprotective mechanisms {{have not been}} fully elucidated. This study investigated relationships between dose- and time-dependent D-met otoprotection from noise- and aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss. Further, the study correlated protective D-met dose to endogenous antioxidant enzyme activity and lipid peroxidation. Specific aim 1 tested D-met dose response protection by auditory brainstem response (ABR) threshold shift analysis and outer hair cell (OHC) quantification. D-met doses ranging from 25 - 200 mg/kg/dose were administered to chinchillas every 12 hours five times each before and after <b>steady</b> state <b>noise</b> exposure totaling 10 D-met doses. Results demonstrated optimal, sub-optimal, and supra-optimal bi-phasic D-met otoprotective dose response. Optimal D-met protection from <b>steady</b> state <b>noise</b> occurred at the 50 mg/kg/dose level. OHC quantification confirmed electrophysiological assessment. Specific aim 2 measured D-met rescue protection from <b>steady</b> state <b>noise</b> exposure by ABR threshold shift analysis and OHC quantification. Five intraperitoneal (ip) D-met injections were administered every 12 hours beginning 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, or 48 hours after <b>steady</b> state <b>noise</b> exposure. Results measured full D-met protection when administration began as late as 24 hours after noise secession. Significant partial protection was also measured for the 36 hour delay. OHC quantification confirmed electrophysiological assessment. Specific aim 3 measured D-met preloading protection from <b>steady</b> state <b>noise</b> exposure by ABR threshold shift analysis and OHC quantification. Five ip D-met injections were administered every 12 hours beginning 2, 2. 5, or 3 days prior to <b>steady</b> state <b>noise</b> exposure. Results measured significant D-met protection when administration ended as early as 24 hours prior to noise exposure. OHC quantification confirmed electrophysiological assessment. Specific aim 4 tested dose-dependent D-met influence on antioxidant enzyme activity and oxidative stress in steady state noise-exposed chinchillas. One ip D-met injection, ranging from 25 to 200 mg/kg/dose, was administered every 12 hours beginning 2 days prior to <b>steady</b> state <b>noise</b> exposure {{for a total of}} 5 injections. Two hours post-noise exposure, animals were sacrificed and serum, liver, and cochleae were collected for endogenous antioxidant analysis. Glutaredoxin 2 (Grx 2) was also analyzed 21 days post-noise exposure. Lower D-met doses (25 and 50 mg/kg/dose) increased superoxide dismutase and catalase activity. Glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase activities significantly increased with D-met doses but only at high concentrations (200 mg/kg/dose). At 21 days post-noise, Grx 2 activity was significantly decreased in liver but greatly increased in the cochlea with high D-met doses (200 mg/kg/dose). The endogenous enzyme studies suggest optimal protective D-met dose determined in specific aims 1 through 3 may be secondary to increased superoxide dismutase and catalase activity which may result from D-met 2 ̆ 7 s free radical scavenging characteristics. Glutathione pathway activity increased only with high D-met doses that resulted in less optimal protection in specific aim 1. Thus, D-met-induced glutathione pathway enhancement may be a compensatory or saturation mechanism rather than the primary protective mechanism. Further, the extended pre-loading and rescue protection may be a result of significantly increased s-glutathionylation activity in the cochlea. Specific aim 5 tested D-met protection from impulse noise exposures. D-met dose response, rescue, and antioxidant enzyme assay protocols, similar to those in specific aims 1, 3, and 4 in steady state animals, were performed on impulse noise-exposed chinchillas. D-met provided dose- and time-dependent optimal protection from impulse noise similar to the steady-state noise studies. Optimal D-met protection was measured at the 100 mg/kg/dose level with complete rescue protection as late as 24 hours post-noise exposure. Endogenous enzyme activity measures demonstrated significant superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activity increases which correlated with optimal D-met protective dose (100 mg/kg/dose) and catalase and superoxide dismutase activity decreases at the higher doses (200 mg/kg/dose). Specific aim 6 tested dose-dependent D-met protection from tobramycin, amikacin, kanamycin, and gentamicin aminoglycoside antibiotics. Guinea pig animal models were normalized to achieve a 30 - 40 dB ABR threshold shift with the lowest possible aminoglycoside dose. D-met and the aforementioned single aminoglycoside were administered for 21, 28, 23, or 14 days, respectively. ABRs were collected and assessed at baseline, 2, 4, and 6 weeks after drug administration initiation. After the 6 -week ABR data collection, cochleae were collected and prepared for OHC quantification. ABR threshold shifts and OHC quantifications demonstrate significant bi-phasic D-met-induced protection from each aminoglycoside type with different D-met doses. OHC quantification confirmed electrophysiological assessment. This study identified optimal protective D-met dose for aminoglycoside- and noise- induced ototoxicity. It also identified optimal protective D-met dose timing for steady state and impulse noise-induced hearing loss. Further, this study has identified dose-dependent D-met-induced endogenous antioxidant changes and Grx 2 enhancement, and therefore s-glutathionylation, as a potential mechanism for D-met protection. Thus, dose- and time-dependent D-met protection influences endogenous antioxidant activity, but exact optimal D-met protection will continue to warrant further investigation...|$|R

This paper discusses results of flyover noise measurements of four small UAVs, including an internal combustion-powered model airplane and three battery-powered multicopters. Basic noise characteristics of these vehicles are discussed, including spectral properties and sound level metrics such as sound pressure level, effective perceived noise level, and sound exposure level. The size and aerodynamic characteristics of the multicopters in particular make their flight path susceptible to atmospheric disturbances such as wind gusts. These gusts, coupled with a flight control system that varies rotor speed to maintain vehicle stability, create an unsteady acoustic signature. The spectral variations resulting from this unsteadiness are explored, in both hover and flyover conditions for the multicopters.

As a follow-up, the current study investigated whether three factors, auditory integration, low-mid frequency audibility and auditory filter bandwidths, might contribute to reduced sentence recognition of HI listeners in the presence of modulated interference. Three findings emerged. First, sentence recognition in modulated noise found in Jin & Nelson (2006) was highly correlated with perception of sentences interrupted by silent gaps. This suggests that understanding speech interrupted by either noise or silent gaps require similar perceptual integration of speech fragments available either in the dips of a gated noise or across silent gaps of an interrupted speech signal. Second, those listeners with greatest hearing losses in the low frequencies were poorest at understanding interrupted sentences. Third, low-to mid-frequency hearing thresholds accounted for most of the variability in Masking Release (MR) for HI listeners.

This {{residual}} noise was 100 times more intense than they had expected, was evenly spread over the sky, and was present day and night. They were certain that the radiation they detected on a wavelength of 7.35 centimeters {{did not come from}} the Earth, the Sun, or our galaxy. After thoroughly checking their equipment, removing some pigeons nesting in the antenna and cleaning out the accumulated droppings, the noise remained. Both concluded that this noise was coming from outside our own galaxy—although they were not aware of any radio source that would account for it.|$|R
40|$|An {{adaptive}} beamformer for behind-the-ear dual-microphone {{hearing aids}} has been optimized for speech intelligibility enhancement {{in the presence}} of disturbing sounds or noise. The noise reduction approach is based on the scheme presented by Vanden Berghe and Wouters (1998). A real-time implementation of the signal processing is realized in Audallion, a wearable, small digital signal processing (DSP) platform. After physical evaluation, speech-in-noise intelligibility tests have been carried out on three normally-hearing and two hearing-impaired subjects. A significant speech reception threshold improvement of 11. 3 dB was obtained in a moderately reverberant environment for one jammer sound source (<b>steady</b> speech-weighted <b>noise</b> or multi-talker babble) in a direction of 90 degrees relative to the direction of the speech. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|Railroads {{have been}} using disk brakes on {{passenger}} cars for more than 60 years, but coupled with a Rolokron anti-lock system to avoid the creation of flat spots (or “square wheels”) when wheels lock and skid on the rail surface (audible as <b>steady</b> bang-bang-bang <b>noise</b> as a train goes by—not {{to be confused with}} the bang-bang...bang-bang....bang-bang sound made by wheels rolling over a rail joint). Usually, brake disks are installed in the center of the axle, but in some applications (such as Bombardier Bi Level commuter cars), only one disk is used, mounted on the axle end outside the truck frame. High speed trains (such as the TGV) may use four disks per axle.|$|R
