5000|$|Some historians, basing on the {{accounts}} from De Administrando Imperio of Constantine VII, {{believe that the}} Hungarians were afraid of the Pechenegs, because the events from 895, when the Pechenegs, called by the Bulgarians, drove away the Hungarians from their old lands, forcing them {{to move to the}} Carpathian Basin, and starting the Hungarian Conquest. And the same writing claims that the Hungarians were terrorized even to think {{about the possibility of a}} war between them and the Pechenegs. But in the last years this question was researched by historians, and the conclusion was that the Byzantine accounts about the crushing defeat and the fear of the Hungarians from Pechenegs are overreacted, and sometimes even false. Al-Masudi's account too contradicts these claims from De Administrando Imperio: if the Hungarians were so terrorized by the Pechenegs, <b>why</b> <b>would</b> they enter in a war with them because the banal case of a foreign merchant? And if the Pechenegs felt <b>so</b> superior, <b>why</b> <b>would</b> they forgive the Hungarians for entering in a war with them, conclude peace with them in equal terms, moreover help them to avenge the Bulgarian attack on the Hungarian lands, letting them also to lead the campaign? In another contemporary work of a Byzantine emperor, Tactica of Leo VI the Wise written around 904, writes about the nations which use nomadic warfare: „The Scythian peoples ..., usually live a nomadic life. them only the Bulgarians and the Turks Hungarians care about the battle order, which is similar by both of them, and because of this, they fight the close combat with greater strength, and they are ruled by a single person”. So, according to this work, which because, unlike the De Administrando Imperio, which is about politics, is a book about war strategy, so is more relevant from the point of view of the question in discussion, the Pechenegs were weak in battle organisation and close combat, in which the Hungarians are presented as good. Also, according to Leo the Wise, the Hungarians had the advantage of having a single ruler, while the Pechenegs never united and obeid to their own tribe cheafs. This shows again that Al-Masudi and Constantine VII were wrong when they wrote that the Hungarians were weaker than the Pechenegs.|$|R

Cancer is a disease that can cause death, and no normal, rational per-son would desire having cancer.
