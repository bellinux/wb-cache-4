40|$|Route {{switching}} is {{an important}} issue to connectionoriented communication that needs to maintain a route for a certain period. This paper suggests a new approach to ease the route switching problems in a network with higher migration rate of hosts. By monitoring the signal strength of messages, a host in a route that receives an incoming message can detect possible route fluctuations locally. As the average signal strength declines into a dangerous level, the host that receives the message will send an advance-warning message to the route source host. If the source host can find more stable routes locally, it will adapt a <b>substitute</b> <b>route</b> and will complete the process of adaptation before the breakdown of the original route actually occurs. If the route source host cannot adapt a new route locally, the source host will be forced to search for a new route by considering the entire network. 1...|$|E

One {{of the most}} common methods for preparation of graphene is chemical exfoliation of graphite using powerful oxidizing agents. Generally, graphene is synthesized through deoxygenation of graphene oxide (GO) by using hydrazine, {{which is one of the}} most widespread and strongest reducing agents. Due to the high toxicity of hydrazine, it is not a promising reducing agent in large-scale production of graphene; therefore, this study focused on a green or sustainable synthesis of graphene and the biocompatibility of graphene in primary mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (PMEFs). Methods: Here, we demonstrated a simple, rapid, and green chemistry approach for the synthesis of reduced GO (rGO) from GO using triethylamine (TEA) as a reducing agent and stabilizing agent. The obtained TEA reduced GO (TEA-rGO) was characterized by ultraviolet (UV) –visible absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), particle size dynamic light scattering (DLS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Results: The transition of graphene oxide to graphene was confirmed by UV–visible spectroscopy. XRD and SEM were used to investigate the crystallinity of graphene and the surface morphologies of prepared graphene respectively. The formation of defects further supports the functionalization of graphene as indicated in the Raman spectrum of TEA-rGO. Surface morphology and the thickness of the GO and TEA-rGO were analyzed using AFM. The presented results suggest that TEA-rGO shows significantly more biocompatibility with PMEFs cells than GO. Conclusion: This is the first report about using TEA as a reducing as well as a stabilizing agent for the preparation of biocompatible graphene. The proposed safe and green method offers <b>substitute</b> <b>routes</b> for large-scale production of graphene for several biomedical applications.

40|$|This thesis mainly {{addresses}} {{two problems}} in wireless ad hoc routing: route failure and route redundancy. Route failures occur frequently in ad hoc networks {{due to their}} highly dynamic topology {{as well as their}} unstable wireless communication medium. Existing route recovery methods lead to long latency and large control overhead. We proposed a novel relay recovery route maintenance protocol RELREC for ad hoc networks to combine the benefits of both proactive and reactive routing protocols and to minimize their drawbacks. In our proposal, one or more <b>substitute</b> <b>routes</b> usually become ready for the recovery of every link in a route before its break, while the route recovery process actually starts only when the upstream node of a link confirms that the link really breaks. Since this scheme does not broadcast any control packet, it can effectively recover a broken link without heavy control overhead traffic. Also, it helps reduce the time delay due to the recovery, since <b>substitute</b> <b>routes</b> are already available when the upstream node initiates the route recovery process. However, the route recovered by RELREC is usually longer than the original one. In fact, route redundancy occurs frequently in ad hoc networks due to highly dynamic topologies. In order to improve the integrated performance of an ad hoc network, we proposed two automatic route shortening strategies to optimize the route length in the network: relay route shortening and active route shortening. While relay shortening can only be initiated by the Relay Nodes in pro-reactive relay recovery processes, active shortening can be launched by any node whenever it overhears a shorter route from its neighbors. Note that the information in Relay Tables is only utilized in route recovery process in RELREC. In order to utilize the Relay Table information to the possible extent to further reduce the control overhead, we extended the usage of Relay Table to route discovery process by incorporating Relay Table information into gossip algorithm, and proposed Relay Gossip Routing (RGR). In RGR, only Relay Nodes are allowed to rebroadcast under a gossiping probability, which differs from existing gossip methods. The simulation study in ns- 2 simulator has demonstrated clearly that our proposed RELREC scheme effectively reduces the average end-to-end time delay by up to 49 % and 31 %, and the normalized control overhead by up to 17 % and 28 % compared with the previous algorithms AODV and DRRS respectively in the best cases. According to the simulation results, the data delivery ratio by our proposed scheme is close to DRRS and AODV. The simulation results confirm that our proposal can provide quick and low-cost route recovery without degrading the packet delivery ratio, while it is adaptive to node mobility and traffic load. When it comes to the automatic route shortening algorithms, active shortening works more effectively than relay shortening does, leading to by far the shortest average route length and the smallest end-to-end time delay among all the algorithms in the simulation. However, the slightly larger control overhead traffic and relatively lower packet delivery ratio harms the performance of active route shortening. In the evaluation of RGR, in order to find the appropriate gossiping value for the Relay Nodes, we firstly studied the relation between packet delivery ratio and gossiping probability p. It is shown that the packet delivery ratio equals or is even higher than that of p = 1 when the value of p is larger than a certain point lying between 0. 35 and 0. 45; {{at the same time the}} total control overhead is smaller than that of p = 1. Accordingly, the gossiping probability is set to 0. 5 in the performance evaluation of RGR. Simulation results confirm that RGR successfully reduces the normalized control overhead by up to 17 % in the best case compared to RELREC, and ensures a similar performance to RELREC in terms of the packet delivery ratio. Although the basic gossip routing yields the lowest normalized control overhead, it yields the worst performance in terms of the packet delivery ratio. It is conspicuous that RGR strikes a better balance between control overhead and packet delivery ratio than basic gossip routing does. Besides, RGR also outperforms basic gossip routing in terms of average time-to-time end delay and average route length. 報告番号:; 学位授与年月日: 2011 - 09 - 27; 学位の種別: 修士; 学位の種類: 修士(工学); 学位記番号:; 研究科・専攻: 工学系研究科電気系工学専...|$|R

40|$|Starting {{from the}} facts that 1, 10 -phenanthroline is a {{frequently}} used ligand in coordination chemistry {{and that it is}} able to form stable complexes {{with a wide variety of}} d-block and f-block metals, we have selected 1, 10 -phenanthroline as a building block for the synthesis of a new class of metal-containing liquid crystals. The aim of this work was to design luminescent liquid crystals and liquid crystals with an unusual geometry. Although different substitution patterns are possible for 1, 10 -phenanthroline, 3, 8 -disubstituted 1, 10 -phenanthrolines were selected as the first target molecules (this work was performed in collaboration with Prof. Duncan W. Bruce, who carried out pioneering research on liquid-crystalline phenanthrolines). This substitution pattern is a logical choice if one wants to obtain compounds with an extended rodlike aromatic core and thus with the necessary anisotropic shape for the formation of mesophases. For the synthesis, 3, 8 -dibromo- 1, 10 -phenanthroline was used as the starting product, which can be functionalized by Sonogashira coupling reactions. The advantage of this approach is that the aromatic rings, which build up the rigid part of the mesogenic molecule, are linked to one another by an acetylene linking group. It is known from the literature that acetylene linking groups are in general much more stable than for instance ester groups. The dibromation of 1, 10 -phenanthroline in the 3 - and 8 -positions turned out to be a difficult task because different brominatedspecies were obtained. The side products include not only the monobrominated 3 -bromo- 1, 10 -phenanthroline, but also other isomers of the dibrominated product and polybrominated species. Even small quantities ofimpurities of these side products cause serious problems for the purification of the final product after Sonogashira coupling reactions. Due tothe tedious purification of the mesomorphic 1, 10 -phenanthroline derivatives, we were able to synthesize only one 1, 10 -phenanthroline derivative, i. e. a tetracatenar compound with four terminal alkoxy chains. The structure of this ligand was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffractionand examination of the thermal behavior indicated that the ligand exhibits a smectic C phase. Unfortunately, the ligand could not be obtained in sufficient quantities to allow the synthesis of metal complexes. Facing the problems with the 3, 8 -disubstituted 1, 10 -phenanthrolines, another type of functionalized 1, 10 -phenanthrolines was considered, i. e. 1, 10 -phenanthrolines mono-functionalized in the 5 -position or difunctionalized in the 5 - and 6 -positions. In a search for the most suitable precursor, we first worked with 5 -amino- 1, 10 -phenanthroline, but it turned out that the 1, 10 -phenanthroline- 5, 6 -dione is a more useful starting product. 1, 10 -Phenanthroline- 5, 6 -dione is easily accessible in high purity byoxidation of 1, 10 -phenanthroline and the product itself is much more stable than 5 -amino- 1, 10 -phenanthroline. By reaction between 1, 10 -phenanthroline- 5, 6 -dione and a benzaldehyde in the presence of ammonium acetate and acetic acid, a 2 -phenyl-imidazo[4, 5 -f]- 1, 10 -phenanthroline canbe obtained. This is a versatile approach because the imidazo[4, 5 -f]- 1, 10 -phenanthroline can be modified by replacing the benzaldehyde by a <b>substituted</b> benzaldehyde. Another <b>route</b> to modify the ligand is the alkylation of one of the nitrogen atoms of the imidazole ring. In first instance, we decided to promote mesomorphism in the imidazo-[4, 5 ‑f]- 1, 10 -phenanthrolines by coupling mesogenic 4 ‑cyanobiphenyl groups via a long, flexible alkyl spacer to a substituted imidazo[4, 5 -f]- 1, 10 -phenanthroline, which acts as the coordinating group. Three different ligands were designed, bearing one, two, and three mesogenic groups, respectively. Complexes of rhenium(I), yttrium(III), lanthanum(III), neodymium(III), samarium(III), europium(III), erbium(III), and ytterbium(III) were synthesized. In the case of the rare-earth complexes, 2 -thenoyltrifluoroacetonate was used as the coligand. The rhenium(I) complexes contain the bromotricarbonylrhenium(I) moiety. All the compounds exhibit enantiotropic mesophases, except the rhenium(I) complex of the ligand bearing only one mesogenic group, which forms only a monotropic mesophase. The ligands and corresponding rhenium(I) complexes show a nematic or a lamello-columnar phase, depending on the number of attached mesogenic groups. All the rare-earth complexes systematically exhibit a nematic mesophase. The luminescence properties of the neodymium(III), samarium(III), europium(III), erbium(III), and ytterbium(III) complexes were examined. The spectroscopic and photophysical properties of these complexes are comparable with those of the [Ln(tta) 3 (phen) ] complexes, where Ln = Nd, Sm, Eu, Er, Yb, tta = 2 -thenoyltrifluoroacetonate, and phen= 1, 10 -phenanthroline. However, an interesting feature of these rare-earth complexes is their good solubility in nematic liquid-crystal solvents, so that by a doping procedure luminescent liquid crystals can be obtained. These could be of interest as active components in emissive liquidcrystal displays. Although a 4 -cyanobiphenyl group was chosen as the mesogenic promoter and a 1, 10 -phenanthroline derivative as the coordinating group, the concept of decoupling of the mesophase-inducing groups and the coordination groups can be extended to other mesogenic groups and ligands. The advantage of this approach is that high coordination number metallomesogens showing a nematic mesophase can be obtained. Traditionally, to obtain high coordination number metallomesogens, a large number oflong alkyl chains are attached to the central metal core, which usuallyleads to (viscous) columnar mesophases. There are however some problemsassociated with this new approach. The most serious problem is that such compounds with complex molecular architectures cannot be easily aligned by external electric or magnetic fields, even not when they exhibit a nematic phase. The linker avoids that phase separation occurs but the mesogenic groups and the coordination group act rather independently. Finally, in the third strategy, 2 -aryl-substituted imidazo[4, 5 -f]- 1, 10 -phenanthrolines were used as building blocks for the synthesis of metal-containing liquid crystals by attaching alkoxy chains in different positions of the phenyl ring. Their molecular shape and space fillingrequirements can be tuned by the choice of an appropriate alkoxy-substituted benzaldehyde for the ligand synthesis. Metal complexes were made with different d-block transition metals, including nickel(II), palladium(II), platinum(II), ruthenium(II), and rhenium(I), as well as with lanthanides and uranyl. The ligands do not form a stable mesophase; they showat best a monotropic mesophase. The most striking feature is the influence of solvent molecules on the thermal behavior of the ligands, as the ethanol adduct of the ligand with hexadecyloxy chains in the 3 - and 4 -positions shows two mesophases, a transient hexagonal columnar phase and a smectic phase. Mesomorphism can be induced in the ligands by coordination to a metal center. The thermal behavior of the metal complexes depends on the metal-to-ligand ratio, but also on the substitution pattern and on the alkyl chain length. Although the palladium(II) and platinum(II) complexes exhibit enantiotropic (unidentified) mesophases with an extended temperature range, complexes with a metal-to-ligand ratio of 1 : 1 are in general not liquid-crystalline or they exhibit only a monotropic mesophase. Nickel(II) complexes with a 1 : 2 metal-to-ligand ratio form enantiotropic mesophases with an extended temperature range for most types of ligands. The uranyl complex, with a 1 : 3 metal-to-ligand ratio, has a propeller-like shape and exhibits a hexagonal columnar mesophase. The uranyl ion acts as a template to bring the ligands in the correct position so that propeller-shaped units can arrange into columns. It was somewhat disappointing that we were not able to synthesize liquid-crystalline lanthanide complexes of this type of imidazo[4, 5 -f]- 1, 10 -phenanthrolines. This is due to the small differences in solubility behavior of the ligands and metal complexes. Lanthanide complexes with shorter alkyl chains could be synthesized, but these complexes were not mesomorphic. The photophysical properties of the rhenium(I) complexes and of the (non-mesomorphic) lanthanide complexes are being investigated at the moment (ongoing work by Jan Ramaekers). The attachment of long alkyl chains to the 2 -phenyl-imidazo[4, 5 -f]- 1, 10 -phenanthroline core was a more classic approach. Although stable mesophases were observed forsome complexes (for instance for the uranyl compound), the stability ofthe mesophases did in general not meet the expectations. Relatively fewmetal complexes were mesomorphic and the mesophases were difficult to characterize or were not stable. No new types of mesophases were observed. This PhD work is hopefully the initiation of further research using 1, 10 -phenanthroline derivatives as building blocks for liquid crystals and especially for metallomesogens. It is possible to highlight some directions for further research concerning these systems. The functionalizationof 1, 10 -phenanthroline in the 3 - and 8 -positions deserves a more careful investigation, because our research illustrates that such compounds can indeed exhibit mesomorphic behavior. This further work could include variation of the alkoxy chain length of the tetracatenar compound, in order to examine the polymorphism as a function of the chain length. Although we observed a smectic C phase for the compound we synthesized, analogous series of compounds described in the literature show a gradual change from smectic to columnar mesomorphism. The mesophase behavior can alsobe tuned by choosing other substitution patterns. However, the most interesting study concerns the synthesis of corresponding metal complexes and to examine the influence of metal fragments on the thermal behavior. In order to avoid purification problems, the synthetic methodology should be reconsidered. One approach is to develop a new method for the synthesis of 3, 8 -dibromo- 1, 10 -phenanthroline in high yield and purity. A second approach is to synthesize the mesomorphic branches in the first stageand to form the 1, 10 -phenanthroline core in the last step via methods similar to the Skraup synthesis of 1, 10 -phenanthroline. The idea of linking mesogenic units via a flexible alkyl chain to a coordinating unit can of course be generalized. Variations of the coordinating unit, metal ion, coligand, length of the flexible linker, type and number of mesogenic groups could be made and could result in a large number of different metallomesogens. Such molecules are of interest from a fundamental point of view because these complex molecular architectures can lead to new types of mesophases. The results obtained from a systematic variation of the constituents of these complexes could be useful to make predictions on the mesophase behavior of this type of mesomorphic compounds. The approach of attaching long alkyl chains to the 2 -phenyl-imidazo[4, 5 -f]- 1, 10 -phenanthroline core was not as successful as that of attaching mesogenic groups via a flexible linker, although there are at least two aspects that deserve further investigation. First of all, the thermal behavior of the nickel(II) and uranyl complexes give the impression that the ionic character of these compounds aid to the stabilization of the mesophases. Research in the future can be directed to the design of ionic metallomesogens based on 1, 10 -phenanthroline. Another aspect for furtherstudy is the influence of H-bonding on the stability of the mesophases of these complexes. Indeed, it was observed that mesomorphism was lost when the proton on the nitrogen atom of the imidazole ring was replaced by an alkyl group, and cocrystallization of the mesogenic compounds with protic solvents has a large influence on the mesophase behavior. Finally, further research will be directed to the functionalization of 1, 10 -phenanthroline in the 4 - and 7 -positions in order to design bent-core liquid crystals. status: publishe...|$|R
