40|$|Our model {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of the international integration of oligopolistic markets on consumer surplus when structural differences in demand (for example, cultural differences) allow firms to engage in the international <b>segmentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>markets.</b> Firms consequently elect to supply either a standardised variety which yields scale economies, or a variety customised to local needs. The principal findings are: - that integration (harmonisation of norms and standards) may reduce competition and consumer surplus; - that integration can bring about a reduction of consumer surplus even when it results in an increase in competition. These results persist when the possibility of entry is introduced and suggests that systematic harmonisation of norms and standards is not necessarily desirable...|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} of marketing standardized products {{depends on the}} ability of the products to penetrate the cultural systems of the intended markets. A <b>segmentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>markets</b> into peripheral (culturally open) and central (culturally closed) consumption contexts makes it possible to identify structures which are receptive to foreign, unfamiliar products and structures which resist globalization. This segmentation principle may be a valuable help for the firm's strategic decisions about the product portfolio's composition of locally adapted and globally standardized products. The theoretical argument builds on data collected on the consumption context of furnishings in Britain, supplemented with Denmark, and the consumption contexts of food in the three Arab cities, Riyadh, Jedda and Dubai.

The empirical studies they review suggest that the cost of equity capital declines following a foreign listing as a result of lower transactions costs or an improvement in the quality and quantity of firm-specific information available to investors. As well, informational asymmetries across countries prevent simultaneous price discovery across exchanges. ...|$|E

40|$|Some {{markets are}} prone to develop shadow {{transactions}} {{for the purpose of}} tax avoidance. Moral sentiments control the allocation of consumers between the legal and illicit markets. Such sentiments include self-esteem and social disapproval. The market solution leads to fiscal externality resulting from tax avoidance and highlights the conflict between private opportunism and collective values. Shadow markets may, however enhance consumer welfare by limiting pricing power of firms and by controlling tax collection. The paper develops a model of endogenous <b>segmentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>markets</b> between moral and immoral behavior.

Despite a substantial literature reporting estimates of willingness to pay (WTP) for animal welfare, there is a belief that in practice people vote for substantially more and better animal welfare as citizens than they {{are willing to pay for}} as consumers. This citizen-consumer gap has significant consequences on the supply chain, although there is limited literature on the capacity and willingness of supply chains to deliver what the consumer wants and is willing to pay for.

The results show a clear segmentation between both groups of consumers, although tests also show that the estimated coefficient for landscape is similar in the tourists' model and in the residents'.

40|$|Indigenous {{firms in}} {{developing}} countries with large domestic markets have unique advantages: the low end provides ‘‘natural”protection from foreign competition, while higher-end segments provide incentives for foreign firms to localize activities and develop channels for future capability building. Paradoxically, in their eagerness to support development efforts of local firms, states often nullify these advantages and limit the opportunities and capabilities that local firms can leverage in the upgrading process. Using the case studies of three large industrial sectors in China that faced similar prospects but had widely different outcomes, this paper develops a framework for understanding how policy shapes the growth and <b>segmentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>markets,</b> and thus the opportunity for industrial upgrading of indigenous firms. The cases show how restrictive demand- and supply-side policies often inadvertently limited the opportunities for upgrading through their effect {{on the availability of}} know-how, inputs, and resources required for industrial upgrading (the supply side), and through their effect on the incentives for upgrading (the demand side). Given that each segment is a crucial rung on the development ladder, industrial upgrading efforts stall when state policy inadvertently knocks out rungs on the development ladde...|$|E
40|$|Institutions {{commonly}} purchase fully utilized, prime {{properties of}} “institutional quality,” while other investors buy both underutilized and subprime properties. Managers of institutions with well diversified, liquid portfolios {{claim to be}} averse to the additional risk and illiquidity of noninstitutional assets. This behavior and its puzzling explanation are predicted by this dynamic model of clienteles. Here, only institutions have separate owners and managers and thereby an agency problem. Institutions trade prime properties with noninstitutional investors, buying fully utilized assets and eventually selling underutilized assets. Across assets average returns are increasing in both risk, either diversifiable or not, and illiquidity. This result reflects the <b>segmentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>markets</b> in equilibrium produced by the agency problem, rather than compensation for either risk or illiquidity. Also, both risk and liquidity are determined endogeneously. The predicted trading patterns are consistent with observed transactions of industrial and office buildings in suburban San Diego during 1993 – 2000. Minor modifications of the model yield similar results for subprime properties and underutilized assets, like land, and that require intensive investigation or management. Key words: agency and real assets; risk, liquidity, and returns; segmented markets...|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The current paper {{addresses}} {{an important}} gap in anthropomorphism research {{by examining the}} individual level factors that correlate with anthropomorphic tendency. Design/methodology/approach - The extant psychology, marketing and consumer psychology literature is reviewed, and eight hypotheses devised. Data from 509 online survey respondents are analysed to identify individual characteristics associated with anthropomorphic tendency. Findings - The results reveal that anthropomorphic tendency varies by individual and is significantly related to personality, age, relationship status, personal connection to animals, and experiential thinking. Research limitations/implications - This paper extends on recent research into the individual nature of anthropomorphic tendency, {{once thought to be}} a universal trait. Given that this paper is the first of its kind, testing of further traits is merited. It is suggested that future research further examine personality, as well as other elements of individual difference, and test the role of anthropomorphic tendency in the development of processing abilities with age. Practical implications - Findings show that anthropomorphic tendency may prove to be a key variable in the <b>segmentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>markets</b> and the design of marketing communications, and that younger, single, more creative, conscientious consumers are an appropriate target for anthropomorphic messages. The importance of personal connection to animals, as well as experiential thinking, are also highlighted. Originality/value - Given the importance of anthropomorphic tendency for the processing of messages involving non-human endorsers, as well as the formation of relevant attitudes and behaviours, this paper fulfils an identified need to further understand the characteristics of those high on this tendency...|$|E
40|$|The banking {{industry}} {{across the globe}} has witnessed {{a revolution in the}} last decade in its efforts to meet the ever growing customer demands. The advancement of technology has encouraged many sectors to move across markets to position themselves as Multinationals and the Sri Lankan banking sector is no different. Due to ever growing demands of the customers and the continuous analysis of customer demands in order to anticipate future needs, <b>segmentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>markets</b> to exploit niches have driven the banks to rely heavily on technology thereby crowding the markets with many products and services. Sri Lankan banks are continuing to introduce innovative electronic banking solutions; however, the question is, how much of these electronic banking solutions are actually used by the customer. It is commonly argued that these electronic banking services are ideally suitable to be marketed among professionals who have access to internet and mostly based in the Colombo district. This study was conducted on banking customers living and working in Colombo district and has access to internet in order to study whether the key expectation of the retail banking customer is “electronic-based, convenient banking solution”. A survey was conducted and results obtained from 404 banking customers were analysed to understand the expectations of customers. Results of the survey reveal that the top most expectations of customers are accurate and secure services. The ATM is ranked as the third most important factor and usage is 80 %. Therefore, the research concludes that the professionals who have access to internet and mostly based in the Colombo district expect the bank to provide a high level of service more than the electronic-based solutions itself...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{contains}} three essays. The first essay, “Matching with Multiple Applications: A Correction,” is a directed search model {{analyzing the}} implications of multiple applications by job seekers on the matching function. This paper shows why the matching function provided by Albrecht et al. (2003) is not correct when the numbers of firms and workers agents are finite, and shows how to derive the correct matching function. ^ The second essay, “Search, Heterogeneity, and Segmentation” is joint work with Nicolas Jacquet, {{the first of a}} two-part project where we look at <b>segmentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>markets</b> when agents are heterogeneous, and deals with the special case when agents are of two types: either they are desirable (high-type) or not (low-type); the companion paper analyzes an economy where agents 2 ̆ 7 heterogeneity is on a continuum. We first characterize all steady state equilibria, and show that the segmented equilibrium can be an equilibrium. Welfare analysis is next carried out and it is shown that the economy with segmentation leads to at least as high an aggregate welfare as the economy when everyone is mixing in one meeting place. Out-of-steady-state dynamics is then analyzed. ^ The third essay, “Directed Search and Firm Size,” shows how the size-wage differential, where larger firms paying their workers higher wages, can be obtained in a directed search setting. Directed search models generally predict that large firms, by promising the worker a higher probability of getting hired, pay lower wages. What I do here is to assume that there is an “optimal” size associated with a firm: if a firm hires less workers than capacity, it cannot be run properly and hence produces less. To avoid this potential loss in production, large firms have an incentive to post higher wages {{in order to get the}} right queue length. I show that if the penalty from not operating at the optimal capacity is large, there always exist parameter where the size-wage differential hold. I also endogenize the fractions of large and small firms in the economy. ...|$|E
