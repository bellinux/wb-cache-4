25|$|Still {{wearing her}} {{fluorescent}} jacket, <b>she</b> <b>knelt</b> down at least 15 meters {{in front of}} the bulldozer, and began waving her arms and shouting, just as activists had successfully done dozens of times that day.... When it got so close that it was moving the earth beneath her, she climbed onto the pile of rubble being pushed by the bulldozer.... Her head and upper torso were above the bulldozer's blade, and the bulldozer operator and co-operator could clearly see her. Despite this, the operator continued forward, which caused her to fall back, out of view of the driver. He continued forward, and she tried to scoot back, but was quickly pulled underneath the bulldozer. We ran towards him, and waved our arms and shouted; one activist with the megaphone. But the bulldozer operator continued forward, until Corrie was all the way underneath the central section of the bulldozer.|$|E
500|$|The ermine mantle {{was removed}} and Anne lifted off her headdress, tucking her hair under a coif. After a brief {{farewell}} to her weeping ladies and {{a request for}} prayers, she kneeled down {{and one of her}} ladies tied a blindfold over her eyes. <b>She</b> <b>knelt</b> upright, in the French style of executions. Her final prayer consisted of her repeating continually, [...] "Jesu receive my soul; O Lord God have pity on my soul." ...|$|E
500|$|The first live {{performance}} of [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] {{was on the}} 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour. She sang it wearing a dress {{that looked like a}} cross between a Mediterranean widow's attire and a clergy's robe. Hundreds of burning candles surrounded her as <b>she</b> <b>knelt</b> {{down in front of the}} stage, the backup singers crying the words [...] "Oh my God" [...] several times. Madonna eventually removed a scarf from her head to display a huge crucifix hanging from her neck, and then rose and sang the full song, while her dancers gyrated around her. Two different performances were taped and released on video: the Blond Ambition: Japan Tour 90, taped in Yokohama, Japan, on April 27, 1990, and Blond Ambition World Tour Live, taped in Nice, France, on August 5, 1990. On his review of the latter release, Entertainment Weeklys Ty Burr praised the [...] "gymnastic dance productions in songs such as 'Where's the Party' and 'Like a Prayer'", calling them [...] "astonishing".|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> had <b>knelt</b> down, and the king, {{still holding}} her hand, knelt down beside her.|$|R
60|$|He twined {{himself up}} to her, as <b>she</b> half <b>knelt</b> by the settle, and {{converted}} her shoulder into a support.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, dearest," [...] she said; and as {{she spoke}} <b>she</b> now <b>knelt</b> at his knees. [...] "I have been asked in marriage, and I have given myself away." ...|$|R
500|$|A formal inquest in February 1944 {{returned}} a verdict of [...] "Suicide, motive unknown". In his report, the coroner found that Tatlock had eaten a full meal shortly before her death. She had taken some barbiturates, {{but not a}} fatal dose. Traces of chloral hydrate were found, a drug normally associated with a [...] "Mickey Finn" [...] when combined with alcohol, {{but there was no}} alcohol in her blood, despite damage to her pancreas that indicated she was a heavy drinker. As a psychiatrist working in a hospital, she had access to sedatives such as chloral hydrate. The coroner found that she had died at around 4:30 pm on January 4. The cause of death was recorded as [...] "acute edema of the lungs with pulmonary congestion" [...] — drowning in the bathtub. It seems likely that <b>she</b> <b>knelt</b> over the bathtub, took chloral hydrate, and plunged her head in the water.|$|E
500|$|A day later, Madonna {{appeared}} on France's Le Grand Journal show. She performed an edited version of [...] "Living for Love" [...] and [...] "Ghosttown". Nicaise described the performance as [...] "an intimate {{interpretation of the}} already known ballad". Writing for Idolator, Bradley Stern {{described it as a}} [...] "deeply emotional performance", where Madonna stood against a piano and sang the song. In the giant screens located {{on either side of the}} platform, burning cities of images were broadcast, as well as those of the World Trade Center collapses during the attack of September 11, 2001. The next performance happened at The Ellen DeGeneres Show in the United States, where Madonna sang [...] "Ghosttown" [...] wearing a black leather dress. <b>She</b> <b>knelt</b> down at one point during the song, and arose to sing the final chorus. Stern gave a positive feedback in MuuMuse, saying that [...] "Madonna delivered yet another stirring performance of the post-apocalyptic tune. In fact, it was likely her best to date, from the outfit choice to the raw, emotional vocal delivery." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the evening, {{at around}} 6 or 7pm, Dan and Joe kidnapped and handcuffed Anton Weekes, a German-Australian market {{gardener}} who lived nearby, reassuring {{him that he}} would not be hurt if he obeyed. They pushed him to the Sherritts' back door and Joe asked Weekes to knock, which he did. Sherritts' young wife asked: [...] "Who is there?", repeated by Sherritt. Prompted by Joe, Weekes replied: [...] "It is me, I have lost my way", to which Sherritt's wife opened the door. Aaron stood framed in the doorway and joked with his German neighbor. [...] "You must be drunk, Anton. You know that it's over that way", he laughed. As Sherritt raised his arm to point the way for Weekes, he almost immediately afterwards made a movement backwards and said, [...] "Who's that?". Two shots were then fired into the house and Sherritt staggered back, having been hit in the left side of the neck, severing his jugular. One of the shots narrowly missed Sherritt's wife. Byrne followed him in and fired again, hitting him in the chest, and Sherritt collapsed. Sherritt died within a few minutes without another saying a word. His mother-in-law, Ellen Barry, testified to the commission that at this point <b>she</b> <b>knelt</b> down by her son-in-law's head, and Byrne called her by her name (they were well acquainted, Ellen Barry had been a particular friend of Byrne's mother) and threatened to shoot her and her daughter if they did not reveal who was in the bedroom. She asked to go outside and when she did, Byrne took off Weekes' handcuffs, telling her [...] "I am satisfied now, I wanted that fellow." [...] Ellen Barry said that she responded [...] "Well, Joe, I never heard Aaron say anything against you." [...] And he replied [...] "He would do me harm if he could; he did his best." ...|$|E
60|$|Tears dropped {{upon the}} brown cheeks {{when she told}} how <b>she</b> had <b>knelt</b> for the communion that same morning, alone with her child, {{surrounded}} no longer by dear, familiar faces.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have {{you ever}} stood before a woman whom {{you know to}} be {{intrinsically}} a good woman, while she has pleaded for release--been the man <b>she</b> has <b>knelt</b> to and implored indulgence of?" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{turned a}} little impatiently. <b>She</b> had <b>knelt</b> {{down at the}} entrance, {{so as to be}} nearer his level, and was holding out her hand. But he did not notice it, and she quietly withdrew it.|$|R
60|$|In {{answer the}} tears sprang to Joan's eyes. <b>She</b> <b>knelt</b> {{down and put}} her arms about the woman.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>knelt</b> {{beside him}} and he no longer cowered, {{limitless}} joy was in his heart and immeasurable gratitude.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>knelt</b> over him, {{gave his}} rough unshaven cheek a swift kiss, and very rapidly {{explained}} her plan.|$|E
60|$|She vanished; and he waited. It was a {{long time}} before the window opened, and he was not aware that, with her {{customary}} complication of feeling, <b>she</b> had <b>knelt</b> for some time inside the room before looking out.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>she</b> sobbed, <b>knelt</b> {{down on a}} great bundle which I saw was stubble straw, {{and again}} began to pray. This time it was in Egyptian, as though she feared lest the Hebrew should be overheard and understood.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> {{suddenly}} <b>knelt</b> {{forward toward}} me, with a glowing darkness in her eyes. [...] "Who cares if it upsets?" [...] she cried. [...] "If you {{say another word}} I will kiss you. And go to the bottom clutching you.|$|R
60|$|He rallied at {{the sound}} of that beloved voice. He looked up at her as <b>she</b> <b>knelt</b> at his head.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>knelt</b> {{upon the}} floor of her cell and clasped her hands, and {{remained}} {{for a long time}} in silence.|$|E
60|$|Then {{she knew}} that her father's mind was wandering, and <b>she</b> <b>knelt</b> down by the bedside, still holding his hand.|$|E
60|$|She did not stir-she {{might have}} been asleep so far as any sound or motion was concerned. He {{went off to the}} bed in the little parlor, and <b>she</b> still <b>knelt</b> there, her heart full of anger, bitterness, sorrow.|$|R
6000|$|... "No—no," [...] she said, {{looking at}} herself, with blood all on her skirt, where <b>she</b> had <b>knelt</b> on the wound which I {{had given the}} dog, and pressed the broken rib into the chest. There was a trickle of blood on her arm.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> returned, and <b>knelt</b> down by Ovid--still slowly reviving. With a fond {{and gentle}} hand, she wiped the {{moisture}} from his forehead.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>knelt</b> {{down beside}} him, and {{supporting}} {{him with her}} left arm, with her right held the gourd to his lips.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>knelt</b> humbly, {{and bent}} her head at Mrs. Van Wyck's feet. But Mrs. Van Wyck drew away, frightened at her vehemence.|$|E
6000|$|Almost {{it seemed}} to her as if father and brother were {{standing}} by her side, as <b>she</b> <b>knelt</b> and prayed.--Oh! how she prayed! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Father!" [...] resumed Eve, {{looking up}} as <b>she</b> still <b>knelt</b> between the knees of Mr. Effingham, and smiling fondly {{in the face}} of him she so piously loved; [...] "there is one {{precious}} hope of which even the barbarians cannot rob us: we may be separated here, but our final meeting rests only with God!" ...|$|R
60|$|Mercedes gladly obeyed, for, at that moment, {{any thing}} was {{preferable}} to {{being required to}} speak. When <b>she</b> had <b>knelt,</b> the queen passed an arm affectionately round her neck, and drew her closer to her person, until, by a little gentle violence, the face of Mercedes was hid {{in the folds of}} Isabella's robe.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think, sir," [...] {{interrupted}} Ann Sidley, {{looking up}} with tearful {{eyes from the}} spot where <b>she</b> still <b>knelt,</b> [...] "that if these people knew how much Miss Eve is sought and beloved, they might be led to respect her as she deserves, and this at least would 'temper the wind to the shorn lamb!'" ...|$|R
60|$|Had {{her years}} of levity and {{indifference}} been fatal to him? was ever her question {{to herself as}} <b>she</b> <b>knelt</b> and prayed for him.|$|E
6000|$|Full on this {{casement}} shone the wintry moon, [...] And threw warm gules on Madeline's fair breast, [...] As down <b>she</b> <b>knelt</b> for heaven's {{grace and}} boon; [...] Rose-bloom fell on her hands, together prest, [...] 220 [...] And on her silver cross soft amethyst, [...] And on her hair a glory, like a saint: [...] She seem'd a splendid angel, newly drest, [...] Save wings, for heaven:--Porphyro grew faint: [...] <b>She</b> <b>knelt,</b> so pure a thing, so free from mortal taint.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good morning, mother dear!" [...] she said, a new, sweet {{tenderness}} in her voice. And then <b>she</b> <b>knelt</b> {{and kissed}} the woman upon her brow.|$|E
6000|$|... "He is dead, he is dead!" [...] <b>she</b> wailed. Robert <b>knelt</b> {{down at her}} side, and {{examined}} the old man, while she waited in an agony.|$|R
60|$|As {{the words}} 'home' and 'father'--those {{household}} gods of the heart's earliest existence--struck upon her ears, a change flashed with electric suddenness over the girl's whole aspect. She raised her wan {{hands to the}} sky; all her woman's tenderness repossessed itself of her heart; and as <b>she</b> again <b>knelt</b> down over the grave, her sobs rose audibly through the calmed and fragrant air.|$|R
60|$|The Lady Lochleven {{sprung from}} the floor, on which <b>she</b> had again <b>knelt,</b> and, having paced the {{apartment}} in great disorder, flung open the lattice, {{as if to}} get air.|$|R
