60|$|I survived my delay at Seymour, {{after which}} I passed again through Cincinnati, and then survived my {{subsequent}} delay at Crestline. As to Cincinnati, I must put on record {{the result of}} a country walk which I took there, or rather on which I was taken by my friend. He professed to know the beauties of the neighborhood and to be well acquainted with all that was attractive in its vicinity. Cincinnati is built on the Ohio, and is closely surrounded by picturesque hills which overhang the suburbs of the city. Over these I was taken, plowing my way through a depth of mud which cannot be understood by any ordinary Englishman. But the depth of mud was not the only impediment nor the worst which we encountered. As we began to ascend from the level of the outskirts of the town we were greeted by a rising flavor in the air, which soon grew into a strong odor, and at last developed itself into a stench that surpassed in offensiveness anything that my nose had ever hitherto suffered. When we were at the worst we hardly knew whether to descend or to proceed. It had so increased in virulence that at one time I felt sure that it arose from some matter buried in the ground beneath my feet. But my friend, who declared himself to be quite at home in Cincinnati matters, and to understand the details of the great Cincinnati trade, declared against this opinion of mine. Hogs, he said, were at the bottom of it. It was the odor of hogs going up to the Ohio heavens--of hogs in a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>transit</b> from hoggish nature to clothes-brushes, saddles, sausages, and lard. He spoke with an authority that constrained belief; but I can never forgive him in that he took me over those hills, knowing all that he professed to know. Let the visitors to Cincinnati keep themselves within the city, and not wander forth among the mountains. It is well that the odor of hogs should ascend to heaven and not hang heavy over the streets; but it is not well to intercept that odor in its ascent. My friend became ill with fever, and had to betake himself to the care of nursing friends; so that I parted company with him at Cincinnati. I did not tell him that his illness was deserved as well as natural, but such was my feeling on the matter. I myself happily escaped the evil consequences which his imprudence might have entailed on me.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} transit experiences of migrants from Sub-Saharan African {{countries in the}} Turkish metropolis of Istanbul. Although the narratives of the individuals met {{in the course of}} fieldwork in Istanbul are the primary focus, the thesis also outlines the larger macro-structural conditions faced. The overarching goal of this thesis is thus, through the experiences of the migrants themselves, to critically approach and discuss the concept of transit with the aid of the theoretical perspectives of social networks analysis and mobility. Based on ethnographic fieldwork and an explorative design, this thesis investigates the ‘black-box’ that the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>transit</b> has hitherto often represented in the literature by focusing on migrants’ experiences of mobility, immobility and social networks. Insecurity, uncertainty, and an overall precariousness constitute the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>transit.</b> Light is shed on questions relating to the peculiarities of a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>transit</b> and its impact on everyday life. The thesis highlights the processual nature of mobility and immobility strategies. The issue of migrant capital (conceptualised as local knowledge, with a particular focus on the migrant experience) is found to be a crucial aspect of immobility in transit. The thesis further identifies a pattern of social stratification based on immobility intersected with legal status and migrant capital, and argues that this stratification is produced by transit movements and, in turn, reproduces transit movements. Related to social stratification is the presentation of Istanbul as the socio-economic context that offers prerequisites for establishment in situ and establishment in mobility...|$|E

40|$|Transit Zones interrogates {{conceptual}} and theoretical issues concerning {{the notion of}} nomadic transience, where movement, stasis and the peripatetic state converge with time. This photographic based research examines {{the relationship between the}} still frame and the moving image and the visual metamorphosis from realism to abstraction in the spatial and temporal dimensions of terrestrial places and non-places. Transit Zones identifies isolates, preserves and presents a moment taken from a continuum; a journey into contemporary spaces to engage viewers at a visceral level. Still or static photographic images within Transit Zones observe the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>transit</b> and the movement encountered in transit; inscribing this state of being somewhere else, in another country, another time and place, taking a momentary glimpse of the world, and seeing it phenomenologically to make meaning of the experience. As John Berger states, the true content of a photograph is invisible, for it derives from a play, not with form, but with time. One might argue that photography is as close to music as to painting. Objects recorded in any photograph (from the most effective to the most commonplace) carry approximately the same weight, the same conviction. What varies is the intensity with which we are made aware of the poles of absence and presence. Between these two poles photography finds its proper meaning. The most popular use of the photograph is as a memento of the absent. Here the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>transit</b> or peripatetique, by its very nature, transforms the real into the state of the unknown, offering a dreamlike quality, as the past resonates in the now. As anthropological places of consumption and communication are photographed, we are presented with a memory, a new reality, translated through movement. Transit Zones is this <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>transit.</b> Central to this research are the symbiotic relationship between the still frame and the moving image, stasis and movement, time and motion, past and present and the selected moment of transience revealed by the narrative of the photograph. The affect of evolving technologies on the transmission of the image and the symbiotic relationship between travel, movement, speed and perception revealing how nomadic wanderings can change our perception of time. The visual presentation and preservation of time is pivotal within Transit Zones research, from the pictorial to abstraction and stasis to movement and the relationship with time and photographic representation...|$|E
40|$|Manuel Delgado {{questions}} whether anyone {{can be described}} as an “immigrant” in the city. Urban centers are precisely characterized for being heterogeneous and unstable spaces, in which nobody is a foreigner since, in the city, all are in a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>transit.</b> Thecity is thus a space of interculturality, of a generalized cultural hybridization in which, even as the fear of excessive hybridization might appear to reinforce identities, identities remain volatile. Indeed, identity is a relational phenomenon; and, in spite of its being indispensable, identity is more a matter of form than of content. To put a stop to the tendencies of intolerance and exclusion a reality should have to be created out of two apparent antagonisms: the right to be different and the right to be equal...|$|E
40|$|While {{the history}} of art is {{dominated}} by aesthetic attitudes relating to materiality, the theme of transnationalism provides the opportunity to reflect upon the increasingly “global” nature of materials and their broader role in the political, spatial and environmental economies of the industrialised world. Materials, viewed as resources, are increasingly “embodied” with values relating to the environmental cost of their extraction, the energy required in the manufacturing process and their relative availability to a commercial market. Newcastle, a mid sized industrial city on the east coast of Australia, has, amongst its achievements, the distinction of being one of the largest coal exporting ports in the Southern Hemisphere. It also exports over 50 000 tonnes of aluminium per annum. The residual effects of this industry are everywhere, from the gigantic tankers that enter and exit the harbour on an hourly basis, to the intricate traces of infrastructure and industry that extend like ribbons into the rich natural resources of the Hunter Valley immediately to the north. This paper will look at a series of art installations which directly engage themes relating to materials, place and export. The projects deal with aluminium, as a locally produced resource which, as well as requiring vast amounts of energy to manufacture, is in a constant <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>transit</b> as it moves between global economies all across the planet. Central to the local economy of Newcastle but consumed across the planet, the paper will look at the way that aluminium opens up new territories for thinking about materiality in art, its “embodied” environmental energies and the economic and transnational contexts which implicate and distribute it...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Integrated {{transfer}} hubs are {{the important}} transportation infrastructures and the passenger distributing center places, {{they play a}} very important role in promoting the development of transportation system. While domestic integrated transfer hubs exist some problems as not playing enough attention to the layout planning. The spatial layout and facility layout are reasonable and imperfect, what making low transfer efficiency, traffic bottlenecks and waste of resources. Therefore layout optimization of integrated transfer hub is a problem urgently to be solved. Combine with features and running <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>transit</b> hubs in our country, passenger transport demand is forecasted and the combination forecasting model is constructed based on quadratic. In layout optimization of integrated transfer hub, the optimization model of facility layout is also put forward with minimum average cost as the object, making layout of hub effectively optimized. While proposing the optimization method, system evaluation are proposed aiming at the method, and internal benefits, social benefit and environmental benefit are used to evaluate the optimized system. 1...|$|R

40|$|Aims. We {{search for}} transiting circumbinary (CB) planets around eclipsing {{binaries}} (EBs). Methods. CB-BLS is a recently-introduced algorithm {{for the detection}} <b>of</b> <b>transiting</b> CB planets around EBs. We describe progress in search sensitivity, generality and capability of CB-BLS, and detection tests of CB-BLS on simulated data. We also describe an analytical approach for the determination of CB-BLS detection limits, and a method for the correct detrending of intrinsically-variable stars. Results. We present some blind-tests with simulated planets injected to real CoRoT data. The presented upgrades to CB-BLS allowed it to detect all the blind tests successfully, and these detections were {{in line with the}} detection limits analysis. We also correctly detrend bright eclipsing binaries from observations by the TrES planet search, and present some of the first results of applying CB-BLS to multiple real light curves from a wide-field survey. Conclusions. CB-BLS is now mature enough for its application to real data, and the presented processing scheme will serve as the template for our future applications of CB-BLS to data from wide-field surveys such as CoRoT. Being able to put constraints even on non-detection will help to determine the correct frequency of CB planets, contributing to the understanding of planet formation in general. Still, searching for transiting CB planets is still a learning experience, similarly to the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>transiting</b> planets around single stars only a few years ago. The recent rapid progress in this front, coupled with the exquisite quality of space-based photometry, allows to realistically expect that if transiting CB planets exist - then they will soon be found.
