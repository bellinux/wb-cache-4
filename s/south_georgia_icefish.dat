50|$|The <b>South</b> <b>Georgia</b> {{microcontinent}} {{was originally}} {{connected to the}} Roca Verdes back-arc basin (southern-most Tierra del Fuego) until the Eocene.

At about 45 Ma, <b>South</b> <b>Georgia,</b> still part of the South American Plate, got buried again and something, possibly rotation of the Fuegian Andes, completed the break-up and allowed <b>South</b> <b>Georgia</b> a second exhumation. During the Oligocene (34-23 Ma) <b>South</b> <b>Georgia</b> was reburied again as seafloor spreading took place in the West Scotia Sea. 10 Ma, finally, the <b>South</b> <b>Georgia</b> microcontinent was uplifted {{as a result of the}} collision with the Northeast Georgia Rise.|$|R
