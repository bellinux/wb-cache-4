I have only met with three other persons besides Miss Angus, two of them men, who had any success in 'telepathic' crystal-gazing. In {{correcting}} 'revises' (March 16), I leant that the brother of Mr. Pembroke (p. 105) wrote from Cairo on January 27. The 'scry' of January 23 represented his ship in the Suez Canal. He was, as his letter shows, in quarantine at Suez, at Moses's Wells, from January 25 to January 26.

6000|$|Let me not be misunderstood. While I am thus {{forced to}} repeat things, which were uttered or thought {{of these men}} in {{reference}} to their military conduct, as heads of that army, it is needless to add, that their personal courage is in no wise implicated in the charge brought against them. But, {{in the name of}} my countrymen, I do repeat these accusations, and tax them with an utter want of intellectual courage--of that higher quality, which is never found without one or other of the three accompaniments, talents, genius, or principle;--talents matured by experience, without which it cannot exist at all; or the rapid insight of peculiar genius, by which the fitness of an act may be instantly determined, and which will supply higher motives than mere talents can furnish for encountering difficulty and danger, and will suggest better resources for diminishing or overcoming them. Thus, through the power of genius, this quality of intellectual courage may exist in an eminent degree, though the moral character be greatly perverted; as in those personages, who are so conspicuous in history, conquerors and usurpers, the Alexanders, the Caesars, and Cromwells; and in that other class still more perverted, remorseless and energetic minds, the Catilines and Borgias, whom poets have denominated 'bold, bad men.' But, though a course of depravity will neither preclude nor destroy this quality, nay, in certain circumstances will give it a peculiar promptness and hardihood of decision, it is not on this account the less true, that, to consummate this species of courage, and to render it equal to all occasions, (especially when a man is not acting for himself, but has an additional claim on his resolution from the circumstance of responsibility to a superior) Principle is indispensibly requisite. I mean that fixed and habitual principle, which implies the absence of all selfish anticipations, whether of hope or fear, and the inward disavowal of any tribunal higher and more dreaded than the mind's own judgment upon its own act. The existence of such principle cannot but elevate the most commanding genius, add rapidity to the quickest glance, a wider range to the most ample comprehension; but, without this principle, the man of ordinary powers must, in the trying hour, be found utterly wanting. Neither, without it, can the man of excelling powers be trustworthy, or have at all times a calm and confident repose in himself. But he, in whom talents, genius, and principle are united, will have a firm mind, in whatever embarrassment he may be placed; will look steadily at the most undefined shapes of difficulty and danger, of possible mistake or mischance; nor will they appear to him more formidable than they really are. For HIS attention is not distracted--he has but one business, and that is with the object before him. Neither in general conduct nor in particular emergencies, are HIS plans subservient to considerations of rewards, estate, or title: these are not to have precedence in his thoughts, to govern his actions, but to follow in the train of his duty. Such men, in ancient times, were Phocion, Epaminondas, and Philopoemen; and such a man was Sir Philip Sidney, of whom it has been said, that he first taught this country the majesty of honest dealing. With these may be named, the honour of our own age, Washington, the deliverer of the American Continent; with these, though in many things unlike, Lord Nelson, whom we have lately lost. Lord Peterborough, who fought in Spain a hundred years ago, had the same excellence; with a sense of exalted honour, and a tinge of romantic enthusiasm, well suited to the country which was the scene of his exploits. Would that we had a man, like Peterborough or Nelson, at the head of our army in Spain at this moment! I utter this wish with more earnestness, because it is rumoured, that some of those, who have already called forth such severe reprehension from their countrymen, are to resume a command, which must entrust to them a portion of those sacred hopes in which, not only we, and the people of Spain and Portugal, but the whole human race are so deeply interested.

40|$|Cyberspace is {{essential}} to all Air Force (AF) missions. It is a domain in which, from which, and through which AF operations are performed. Actions in cyberspace can have digital, kinetic, and human effects. Increasingly, the cyberspace domain is contested and/or denied. Yet our ability to address opportunities and threats is constrained by time, treasure, and talent. Cyber Vision 2025 provides the Air Force vision and blueprint for cyber Science and Technology (S&T) spanning cyberspace, air, space, command and control, intelligence, and mission support.

Nevertheless, methods for developing real-time multi-tasking programs, while well understood, still lack the degree of formality demanded by safety-critical applications. Here we present a set of formal refinement rules for designing real-time multitasking programs. The rules introduce the computational components assumed by real-time scheduling theory, and can thus exploit a known schedulability test. 2 Real-time multi-tasking refinement rules The rules are expressed using timed refinement calculus notation [14]. <b>See</b> <b>Appendices</b> A to <b>C</b> for the definitions used below.

Also included in the appendix are equations used in estimating individual cancer risk and hazard quotients. Parameter values and references are presented in Appendices A and E. The individual equations are organized into six groups. These are as follows: 1) soil concentration; 2) terrestrial food chain concentration; 3) aquatic food chain and drinking water concentration; 4) direct inhalation exposure; 5) cancer risks and hazard quotients; and 6) breastmilk exposure. Each group is discussed in a separate section in this appendix. The introduction to each section provides a brief discussion of the equations. Equations are presented in a table format. The tables show the equations, identify the exposure scenarios, list all input parameters, and identify the default values where appropriate. The default value column of the tables may contain one of the following designations instead of (or in addition to) a default value: • shaded, no value: this signifies that this row of the table describes either the parameter being calculated by the given equation or a units conversion constant in the equation. • modeled (<b>see</b> <b>Appendix</b> A) : this indicates a deposition rate or air concentration, as determined by the ISCSTDFT model, as described in Section 3. • calculated (see Table C-x. x) : this indicates that an equation is given for calculating the parameter in the indicated table. • site-specific (<b>see</b> <b>Appendix</b> A) : this indicates that the parameter is site-specific and that no default value is considered appropriate. • chemical-specific (<b>see</b> <b>Appendix</b> E) : this indicates that the parameter is chemical-specific, and specific values are provided in Appendix E. • varies (<b>see</b> <b>Appendix</b> E) : this indicates that the parameter- typically an exposure parameter- varies, and specific values are provided in Appendix E...|$|R

40|$|Before I go {{into the}} history of F- 1, I want to discuss the F- 1 engine s role in putting man on the moon. The F- 1 engine was used in a cluster of five on the first stage, and that was the only power during the first stage. It took the Apollo launch vehicle, which was 363 feet tall and weighed six million pounds, and threw it {{downrange}} fifty miles, threw it up to forty miles of altitude, at Mach 7. It took two and one-half minutes to do that and, in the process, burned four and one-half million pounds of propellant, a pretty sizable task. (<b>See</b> Slide 2, <b>Appendix</b> <b>C)</b> My history goes back to the same year I started working at Rocketdyne. That s where the F- 1 had its beginning, back early in 1957. In 1957, there was no space program. Rocketdyne was busy working overtime and extra days designing, developing, and producing rocket engines for weapons of mass destruction, not for scientific reasons. The Air Force contracted Rocketdyne to study how to make a rocket engine that had a million pounds of thrust. The highest thing going at the time had 150, 000 pounds of thrust. Rocketdyne s thought was the new engine might be needed for a ballistic missile, not {{that it was going to}} go on a moon shot...|$|R
