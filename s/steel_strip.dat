5|$|Following his {{swearing}} in as Lord Protector in 1653, Oliver Cromwell {{became a}} proponent of Blondeau's coinage method, which had yet to find favour in the nation's minting establishment. In 1654, Cromwell's government placed Blondeau {{in charge of a}} planned mint in Ireland, where the coinage was heavily debased by fraudulent means. The proposed mint never came into existence, but in 1656, Blondeau was given official appointment to strike £2,000 worth of coins bearing Cromwell's portrait with captured Spanish silver. The former Royal Mint superintendent, William John Hocking, believed that the edge lettering on Blondeau's coinage was created by means of a perforated <b>steel</b> <b>strip,</b> through which the coin's metal flowed during striking, creating the raised designs and wording. Hocking suggested that this technique would have been less costly than the older method involving the split collar, because the <b>steel</b> <b>strip</b> could be replaced more economically. However, the numismatist Peter B. Gaspar determined that Blondeau's Cromwell-era coinage was struck without a collar, which suggests that he used a machine to impart the edge lettering prior to striking.|$|E

The influence rules of two factors including the cross sectional area of <b>steel</b> <b>strips</b> and vertical compression were investigated. The results show that, as for unreinforced masonry wall, {{the relationship of the}} shear capacity of unreinforced masonry wall and the vertical compressive strain is linear under lateral load; the speed of stiffness degeneration is accelerated after the peak point of the curves, but decrease with the increasing of lateral displacement. As for masonry wall strengthened with <b>steel</b> <b>strips,</b> the shear capacity increases significantly, and shows nonlinear relationship with the cross section area of the <b>steel</b> <b>strips</b> and vertical compression; ductility is improved. Finally, a computational formula of shear capacity based on a lot of parametric analysis is proposed to calculate the sectional dimension of <b>steel</b> <b>strips,</b> and it provides theoretical foundation for establishing thorough design method of masonry wall strengthened with <b>steel</b> <b>strips...</b>|$|R
40|$|In the {{production}} of pocket type electrodes for Ni-Cd batteries perforation of proper <b>steel</b> <b>strips</b> and then nickel platting of perforated <b>steel</b> <b>strips</b> were made. In the nickel platting process, the organic solvent, trichloroethylene, has previously been used for cleaning. Due to the carcinogenic nature of trichloroethylene and the many operations previously required during cleaning, it was considered to do cleaning of perforated <b>steel</b> <b>strips</b> without use of the mentioned organic solvent. In the purpose of elimination of trichloroethylene from the cleaning process of perforated <b>steel</b> <b>strips,</b> the tests of perforation of <b>steel</b> <b>strips</b> with use of oils of different viscosity were made. It was shown {{that there was no}} dysfunction during the work of the perforation plants, meaning there was no additional heating of the strips, deterring of the steel filings, nor excessive wearing of the perforation apparatus. The perforation percent was the same irrelevant of the viscosity of the used oil. Before being perforated using the oils with different viscosity, the nickel platting <b>steel</b> <b>strips</b> were cleaned in different degreasers (based on NaOH as well as on KOH). It was shown that efficient cleaning without the use of trichloroethylene is possible with the use of oil with smaller viscosity in the perforated <b>steel</b> <b>strips</b> process and the degreaser based on KOH in the cleaning process, before nickel platting. It also appeared that the alkali degreaser based on KOH was more efficient, bath corrections were made less often and the working period of the baths was longer, which all in summary means less quantity of chemicals needed for degreasing of perforated <b>steel</b> <b>strips...</b>|$|R

2500|$|The shift or {{transition}} from Nordic Classicism to Functionalism is said sometimes {{to have been}} sudden and revolutionary, as with Aalto's Turku Sanomat newspaper offices and Paimio Sanatorium, which employs such distinct modernist features as use of reinforced concrete construction, <b>steel</b> <b>strip</b> windows and flat roofs. The shift in Aalto's design approach from classicism to modernism is epitomised by the Viipuri Library (1927–35), which went through a transformation from an originally classical competition entry proposal (1927) to the completed high-modernist building, following delays in the project, yet still retaining many of {{the ideals of the}} original idea. Traces of Nordic Classicism would naturally continue synthesized with Functionalism and a more idiosyncratic individual style, a well-known example being Erik Bryggman's mature work, the Resurrection Chapel in Turku, dating from as late as 1941. Indeeed, in a major study of Finnish architecture during this period, albeit with a particular emphasis on Aalto, Greek historian-theoretician Demetri Porphyrios, in Sources of Modern Eclecticism (1983), argues that the [...] "organic" [...] ordering of Aalto's mature works makes use of the same [...] "heterotopic" [...] ordering - i.e. the juxtaposition of contrary elements - that is evident in the Nordic National Romantic architecture {{from the end of the}} 19th and beginning of the 20th century; for example, the works of Eliel Saarinen.|$|E

5000|$|Another area of {{difference}} between EPS-treated <b>steel</b> <b>strip</b> and acid-pickled <b>steel</b> <b>strip</b> is rust resistance. Conventional acid-pickled <b>steel</b> <b>strip</b> is frequently coated with a thin film of oil {{to serve as a}} barrier to contact with oxygen so as to prevent rusting. EPS-processed steel is inherently rust-inhibitive and, therefore, needs no oil or other coating to prevent rusting. Many [...] "downstream" [...] processes and steel fabrication processes must have the steel's oil coating (or other surface contaminants) removed as a precursor step of the process.

5000|$|The rust {{resistance}} of EPS-processed <b>steel</b> <b>strip</b> {{is superior to}} that of acid pickled <b>steel</b> <b>strip</b> primarily because acid pickling imposes a corrosion [...] "penalty" [...] on the steel which EPS processing does not.

Although the <b>steel</b> <b>strip</b> is thoroughly rinsed with clean water after immersion in the HCl bath, some residual amount of chlorine (Cl) remains {{on the surface of the}} strip. Chlorine reacts very readily with oxygen to form chlorides, so the free Cl acts as something of a [...] "magnet" [...] for oxygen.
