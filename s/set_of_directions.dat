Legrand kept the scrap and used it to sketch the bug for the narrator; in so doing, though, he noticed traces of invisible ink, revealed by the heat of the fire burning on the hearth. The parchment proved to contain a cryptogram, which Legrand deciphered as a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>directions</b> for finding a treasure buried by the infamous pirate [...] "Captain Kidd." [...] The final step involved dropping a slug or weight through the left eye of the skull in the tree; their first dig failed because Jupiter mistakenly dropped it through the right eye instead. Legrand muses that the skeletons may be the remains of two members of Kidd's crew, who buried the chest and were then killed to silence them.|$|E

2500|$|Although the unphysical axes in {{the space}} of {{detailed}} configurations are a fundamental property of the physical model, there is no special <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>directions</b> [...] "perpendicular" [...] to them.

[...] Judicious gauge fixing can simplify calculations immensely, but becomes progressively harder as the physical model becomes more realistic; its application to quantum field theory is fraught with complications related to renormalization, especially when the computation is continued to higher orders. [...] Historically, the search for logically consistent and computationally tractable gauge fixing procedures, and efforts to demonstrate their equivalence {{in the face of a}} bewildering variety of technical difficulties, has been a major driver of mathematical physics from the late nineteenth century to the present.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{uniqueness}} problem for bounded sets in Discrete Tomography, namely to decide when an unknown finite subset of points in a multidimensional grid is uniquely determined by its X-rays corresponding to a given <b>set</b> <b>of</b> lattice <b>directions.</b> In Brunetti et al.

We show that d + 1 represents the minimal number <b>of</b> <b>directions</b> we need in Zn (n ≥ d ≥ 3) to distinguish all the subsets of a finite grid by their X-rays in these directions, under the requirement that such directions span a d-dimensional subspace of Zn.

For optimal control problems having mixed control-state constraints, two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>directions</b> can be distinguished in the input function space: the so-called sensitivity-seeking directions, along which a small input variation does not affect the active constraints, and the complementary constraint-seeking directions, along which an input variation does affect the respective constraints. Two selective input adaptation scenarios can be defined, namely, adaptation along each <b>set</b> <b>of</b> input <b>directions.</b> This paper proves the important result that the cost variation due to the adaptation along the sensitivity-seeking directions is typically smaller than that due to the adaptation along the constraint-seeking directions...|$|R
