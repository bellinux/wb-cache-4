50|$|Ell is most {{remembered for}} his strong {{interest}} in recreation and conservation. From 1900 onwards, Ell pushed for <b>the</b> creation <b>of</b> a network of scenic reserves along Christchurch's Port Hills, linked by the Summit Road and with a network of rest-houses to allow travellers and walkers to refresh themselves. Three of these rest-houses, designed by architect Samuel Hurst Seager, were completed during Ell's lifetime: <b>the</b> <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bellbird, <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kiwi, and <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Packhorse. The last, and grandest, <b>the</b> <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Takahe, was not completed until long after Ell’s death, in 1949. All four houses were built of local stone, and designed {{to blend in with}} <b>the</b> landscape. <b>The</b> <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kiwi and <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Takahe still function as commercial rest stops serving refreshments while <b>the</b> <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bellbird survives only as a shelter, but is still a useful stopping place for a picnic and the starting point for some short walks. <b>The</b> <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Packhorse is managed by <b>the</b> Department <b>of</b> Conservation and used as a hut by trampers.|$|R

5|$|Also {{hidden from}} {{scrutiny}} was the growing antagonism between the Khmer Rouge and their North Vietnamese allies. The radical {{leadership of the}} party could never escape the suspicion that Hanoi had designs on building an Indochinese federation with the North Vietnamese as its master. The Khmer Rouge were ideologically tied to the Chinese, while North Vietnam's chief supporters, the Soviet Union, still recognized the Lon Nol government as legitimate. After the <b>signing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Paris Peace Accords, PAVN cut off the supply of arms to the Khmer Rouge, hoping to force them into a cease-fire. When the Americans were freed by the <b>signing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accords to turn their air power completely on the Khmer Rouge, this too was blamed on Hanoi. During the year, these suspicions and attitudes led the party leadership to carry out purges within their ranks. Most of the Hanoi-trained members were then executed on the orders of Pol Pot.|$|E
