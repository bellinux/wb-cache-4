5|$|Hyperion is Titan's nearest {{neighbor}} in the Saturn system. The two moons {{are locked in}} a 4:3 mean-motion resonance with each other, meaning that while Titan makes four revolutions around Saturn, Hyperion makes exactly three. With an average diameter of about 270km, Hyperion is smaller and lighter than Mimas. It has an extremely irregular shape, and a very odd, tan-colored icy surface resembling a sponge, though its interior may be partially porous as well. The average density of about 0.55g/cm3 indicates that the porosity exceeds 40% even assuming it has a purely icy composition. The surface of Hyperion is covered with numerous impact craters—those with diameters 2–10km are especially abundant. It is the only moon besides the small moons of Pluto known to have a chaotic rotation, which means Hyperion has no well-defined poles or equator. While on short timescales the satellite approximately rotates around its long axis {{at a rate of}} 72–75° per day, on longer timescales its axis of rotation (<b>spin</b> <b>vector)</b> wanders chaotically across the sky. This makes the rotational behavior of Hyperion essentially unpredictable.|$|E

500|$|Spin can be {{represented}} by a vector whose length is measured in units of the reduced Planck constant ħ (pronounced [...] "h bar"). For quarks, a measurement of the <b>spin</b> <b>vector</b> component along any axis can only yield the values +ħ/2 or −ħ/2; for this reason quarks are classified as spin- particles. The component of spin along a given axis – by convention the z axis – is often denoted by an up arrow ↑ for the value + and down arrow ↓ for the value −, placed after the symbol for flavor. For example, an up quark with a spin of + along the z axis is denoted by u↑.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The orientations of the <b>spin</b> <b>vectors</b> of 128 disk galaxies (66 S 0 galaxies, 62 S and Irr galaxies) in the Coma cluster {{have been}} {{statistically}} studied. With {{respect to the}} expected isotropic distribution, {{the distribution of the}} <b>spin</b> <b>vectors</b> in the Coma cluster is shown to be anisotropic, in the sense that S 0 galaxies tend to have their <b>spin</b> <b>vectors</b> parallel to the cluster plane, while the <b>spin</b> <b>vectors</b> of S and Irr galaxies tend to be parallel or perpendicular to the cluster plane. The excess orientation of the projection on the cluster plane of the <b>spin</b> <b>vectors</b> of all disk galaxies are around directions which deviate from the direction pointing to the cluster center by an angle of 30 degrees. Additionally, the projection on the cluster plane of the <b>spin</b> <b>vectors</b> of S and Irr galaxies also tend to point towards the cluster center.

As a result, a relatively large and complete database with no selection effect of the member galaxies has been established. We provide the APM measured values of the position angle (P.

However, for statistically large collections of particles that have been placed in the same pure quantum state, such as {{through the use of a}} Stern-Gerlach apparatus, the <b>spin</b> <b>vector</b> does have a well-defined experimental meaning: It specifies the direction in ordinary space in which a subsequent detector must be oriented in order to achieve the maximum possible probability (100%) of detecting every particle in the collection. For spin- particles, this maximum probability drops off smoothly as the angle between the <b>spin</b> <b>vector</b> and the detector increases, until at an angle of 180 degrees—that is, for detectors oriented in the opposite direction to the spin vector—the expectation of detecting particles from the collection reaches a minimum of 0%.|$|E
5000|$|As a {{qualitative}} concept, the <b>spin</b> <b>vector</b> is often handy {{because it is}} easy to picture classically.

40|$|The {{progress}} of the studies on the orientation of galaxies in the Local Supercluster (LSC) is reviewed and a summary of recent results is given. Following a brief introduction of the LSC, we describe the results of early studies based on two-dimensional analysis, which were mostly not conclusive. We describe next the three-dimensional analysis, which is used widely today. Difficulties and systematic effects are explained {{and the importance of}} selection effects is described. Then, results based on the new method and modem databases are given, which are summarized as follows. When the LSC is seen as a whole, galaxy planes tend to align perpendicular to the LSC plane with lenticulars showing the most pronounced tendency. Projections onto the LSC plane of the <b>spin</b> <b>vectors</b> of Virgo cluster member galaxies, and to some extent, those of the total LSC galaxies, tend to point to the Virgo cluster center. This tendency is more pronounced for lenticulars than for spirals. It is suggested that &# 39;field&# 39; galaxies, i. e., those which do not belong to groups with more than three members, may be better objects than other galaxies to probe the information at the early epoch of the LSC formation through the analysis of galaxy orientations.
