The disposition and morphology of bacteria from the edges of clear zones on penicillin assay plates under conditions sufficiently standardized permitted a distinction between sensitive and resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus. With a sensitive strain ‘ghost zones ’ were formed of partially lysed, distorted and abnormally staining cells; with a resistant strain a ‘ <b>scatter</b> <b>zone</b> ’ was formed of apparently normal cells in isolated colonies. For plate assay work, a sensitive strain may be used when only low concentrations of the drug are available; a resistant strain {{may be expected to}} give a sharper zone edge, but will require higher concentrations to provide an adequate response. Examinations of assay plates have been made by a number of workers in studying the antibacterial properties of penicillin. The wide use of Staph. aureus for penicillin assay has prompted the inclusion of penicillin-sensitive strains in such investigations, but a detailed comparative study of assay plate...|$|E

30|$|In this work, we {{prepared}} random and periodic Ag nanoparticles {{as well as}} closely packed PS spheres and studied their scattering behaviour using angular resolved scattering measurements. The different scattering properties of the three nanoparticles are revealed, showing that random Ag nanoparticles have a broadband scattering ability with large scattering angles due to their wide particle size distribution. In contrast, both periodic nanoparticle types are characterized by a strong <b>scattering</b> <b>zone</b> where <b>scattering</b> angles are increasing as the wavelength goes up. It {{can be explained by}} the zero-order diffraction for closely packed PS spheres. Overall, it is proved that angular resolved scattering measurements are a promising experimental characterization method to identify the scattering properties of nanoparticles and can support their selection for specific applications.|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} {{studies have shown that the}} {{visibility}} of scattered broad emission lines in Seyfert 2 galaxies is strongly dependent on the IRAS f_ 60 /f_ 25 flux ratio, where those Seyfert 2 s with `warm' IRAS colours show polarised broad line emission. It is now clear that this effect is due to the increasing dominance of the galactic rather than the AGN emission at 60 um in less luminous `cool' Seyfert 2 s. However, we present evidence that the 25 um emission is a good measure of the AGN luminosity for most Seyfert 2 s. Using this result, we show that the visibility of scattered broad line emission has a dependence on the AGN luminosity.

In particular, numerical findings on a friction stir-welded aluminium plate-like structure are reported. Damage was introduced in the heat affected zone and modelled using a multi-scale material constitutive model (Preisach–Mayergoyz space). Studies were conducted for two different transducer configurations. Particular attention was devoted to find the optimum time-reversed window to be re-emitted in the structures. The methodology was compared with traditional time-reversal acoustics (TRA), showing significant improvements. While the traditional TRA was not able to clearly localise the damage, the developed technique identified in a clear manner the faulted zone, showing its robustness to locate and characterize nonlinear sources, in presence of a multi-material medium...|$|R

The source had a factor ∼ 3 higher 2 – 10 keV flux (∼ 1. 2 × 10 − 11 erg cm− 2 s− 1) than the historical minimum and a factor ∼ 7 less than the historical maximum. The XIS spectrum of NGC 2992 can be described by several components. There is a primary continuum, modeled as a power-law with a photon index of Γ = 1. 57 + 0. 06 − 0. 03 that is obscured by a Compton-thin absorber with a column density of 8. 0 + 0. 6 − 0. 5 × 1021 cm− 2.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis reconnaissance {{is the first}} ecological study of the deep scattering layers (DSL) in the eastern tropical Pacific. It was made during two three month cruises of the R/V TE VEGA, {{one of which was}} predominantly in the Gulf of California. The reconnaissance is based on over 100 fathometer echograms and 100 trawls which fished for a period of one hour with an opening and closing Tucker midwater trawl. Echograms of two fathometer frequencies (30 Kc and 11 Kc) indicated that two latitudinal <b>scattering</b> <b>zones</b> may exist. Temperature, oxygen, light intensity, faunal composition, and swimbladder morphology were investigated with relation to the DSL. The oxyclines associated with the eastern Pacific oxygen minimum zone seemed to have little effect on the DSL. Possible further evidence for the migration of DSL organisms for feeding purposes was apparent as the maximum night surface scattering was observed at the depth of maximum Chlorophylla or phytoplankton. Frequency comparisons indicated a possible gradient of the size of organisms in the DSL with smaller organisms toward the top of the layer. A twenty-four hour continuous observation of an equatorial Pacific DSL diurnal cycle and an evaluation of possible scattering organisms are included. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|The radars {{that form}} the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) receive scatter from ionospheric {{irregularities}} in both the E- and F-regions, {{as well as the}} Earth's surface, either ground or sea. For ionospheric scatter, the current SuperDARN standard software considers a straight-line propagation from the radar to the <b>scattering</b> <b>zone</b> with an altitude assigned by a standard height model. The knowledge of the group delay to a scatter volume is not sufficient for an exact determination of the location of the irregularities. In this study, the difference between the locations of the backscatter echoes determined by SuperDARN standard software and by ray tracing has been evaluated, using the ionosonde data collected at Sodankylä, which is in the field-of-view of Hankasalmi SuperDARN radar. By studying elevation angle information of backscattered echoes from the data sets of Hankasalmi radar in 2008, we have proposed an adjusted fitting location model determined by slant range and elevation angle. To test the reliability of the adjusted model, an independent data set is selected in 2009. The result shows that the difference between the adjusted model and the ray tracing is significantly reduced and the adjusted model could provide a more accurate location for backscatter targets...|$|R
40|$|Two Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) hyperspectral images {{selected}} from the Los Angeles area, one representing urban and the other, rural, were used to examine their spatial complexity across their entire spectrum of the remote sensing data. Using the ICAMS (Image Characterization And Modeling System) software, we computed the fractal dimension values via the isarithm and triangular prism methods for all 224 bands in the two AVIRIS scenes. The resultant fractal dimensions reflect changes in image complexity across the spectral range of the hyperspectral images. Both the isarithm and triangular prism methods detect unusually high D values on the spectral bands that fall within the atmospheric absorption and <b>scattering</b> <b>zones</b> where signature to noise ratios are low. Fractal dimensions for the urban area resulted in higher values than for the rural landscape, and {{the differences between the}} resulting D values are more distinct in the visible bands. The triangular prism method is sensitive to a few random speckles in the images, leading to a lower dimensionality. On the contrary, the isarithm method will ignore the speckles and focus on the major variation dominating the surface, thus resulting in a higher dimension. It is seen where the fractal curves plotted for the entire bandwidth range of the hyperspectral images could be used to distinguish landscape types as well as for screening noisy bands...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, coda waves {{recorded}} by local seismographic networks will be analyzed {{to estimate the}} three-dimensional spatial distribution of scatterers (SDS). This will be done by using the single scattering approximation. This approach leads to a huge system of equations {{that can not be}} solved by traditional methods. For the first time, we will use the Simultaneous Iterative Reconstructive Technique (SIRT) to solve this kind of system in seismological applications. SIRT is slow but provides a means to carry out the inversion with greater accuracy. There is also a very fast non-iterative method that allows to carry out the inversion 102 times faster, with a higher resolution and reasonable accuracy: the Filtered Back-Projection (FBP). If one wishes to use this technique it is necessary to adapt it to the geometry of our problem. This will be done {{for the first time in}} this thesis. The theory necessary to carry out the adaptation will be developed and a simple expression will be derived to carry out the inversion. FBP and SIRT are then used to determine the SDS in southern India. Results are almost independent of the inversion method used and they are frequency dependent. They show a remarkably uniform distribution of the scattering strength in the crust around GBA. However, a shallow (0 - 24 km) strong scattering structure, which is only visible at low frequencies, seems to coincide with de Closepet granitic batholith which is the boundary between the eastern and western parts of the Dharwar craton. Also, the SDS is estimated for the Galeras volcano, Colombia. Results reveal a highly non-uniform SDS.

High temperature devices (above 2 000 K) developed for that purpose, based on various heating techniques (induction, imaging furnaces, lasers, gas-flame heaters and principally Joule heated devices) are reviewed.

At the present time thermal neutron high flux reactors offering a wide range of neutron wavelengths are available, and a new generation of more and more efficient multidetectors has emerged in the last decade; the data acquisition and consequently the high temperature exposure time have been notably reduced, opening a way for precise and reliable experiments in the 3 000 K range.

Monitoring equipment {{with the ability to}} measure the electric strength of such signals at field sites, were designed and assembled in Italy. From 1993 onwards, the electric field strength of the MCO (216 kHz, France) broadcasting station has been collecting measurements at two sites in central Italy that were chosen according to very low noise levels. At the end of 1996, radio signals from the CLT (189 kHz, Italy) and CZE (270 kHz, Czech Republic) broadcasting stations were included in the measurements. Meteorological data from central Italy were also collected over the same time period in order to study the influence of weather conditions on the experimental measurements. During the monitoring period, we observed some evident attenuation of the electric field strength in some of the radio signals at some of the receivers. The duration of the attenuation observed was several days, so it could possibly be related to particular meteorological conditions. On the other hand, this phenomenon might represent precursors of moderate (3. 0 M 3. 5) earthquakes that occurred near the receivers (within 50 km) along the transmitter-receiver path. In this case, {{it is possible that the}} pre-seismic processes could have produced irregularities in the troposphere, such as ducts, reflecting layers and <b>scattering</b> <b>zones,</b> so that some local troposphere defocusing of the radio signals might have occurred.

Unfortunately, we could not use the data of the other receiver in this case, due to frequent interruptions in the data set. The increase might have been a precursor of the strong seismic sequence (M = 5. 0 ? 6. 0) that occurred during March ?
