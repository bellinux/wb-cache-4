We are focused on line and staff style of organizations because they are closely knitted. In line with this, their difference might not be easily identified by the laymen in organizational analysis and management. So, the main aim of our paper was to identify certain benefits from the knowledge of line and staff organizational analysis for modern managers as well as for employed people in an organisation. In the paper is concluded that the degree or extent of complexity, dependability, stability and adaptability of the technology and techno-structure of an organization will naturally dictate the way and manner the operations of the enterprise are distributed.

40|$|Bureaucracy is {{featured}} by vertical hierarchical structure {{in which the}} decision maker usually lacks {{direct access to the}} informed agent, and the <b>span</b> <b>of</b> discretionary <b>authority</b> decreases top down. In this paper we investigate the delegation scheme in three-level hierarchies. The minister delegates authority to a biased senior bureaucrat, then the senior can make further delegation decision to the junior. We provide a full characterization of the implemented interval delegation set. It’s shown that the e ¢ ciency is attained if and only if the senior is intermediately biased. We reverse the conclusion in Dessein (2002) that delegation dominates informative cheap talk and shows that, for some range of senior’s preferences, the minister prefers keeping control and using the senior as information gate-keeper. The implication for hiring policy, job contents and promotion decision in bureaucracy is examined. Given the bias of the senior, the optimal junior should be intermediately between the senior and the minister. Under certain conditions the loyal bureaucrat would be assigned to action-level and doesn’t get promotion. Complete delegation to an acquainted knowledgeable senior may arise endogenously by the minister’s ignorance about the con‡ict of interest of the junior...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a theory of}} the allocation <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> in an organization in which centralization {{is limited by the}} agent’s ability to disobey the principal. We extend the concept <b>of</b> real <b>authority</b> by observing that not only does the principal have to be informed to give an order, but also that the worker must be willing to follow the order. We show that workers are given more authority when they are costly to replace or do not mind looking for another job, even if they have no better information than the principal. The allocation <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> thus depends on external market conditions as well as the information and agency problems emphasized in the literature.

The advantage of the model is that it permits the calculation of an optimum formal structure of the hierarchy in terms <b>of</b> the <b>span</b> <b>of</b> control at different levels. The general result is that <b>spans</b> <b>of</b> control should increase as one goes down the levels of the hierarchy. However, when time savings become more and wage costs less important, the difference between the optimum <b>spans</b> <b>of</b> control shrinks; in the limit, when wage costs are not considered at all, they become equal.
