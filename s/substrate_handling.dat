This regulation requires adapted mechanisms favoring the handling of cholesterol in aqueous compartments, as well as its transfer into or out of membranes, involving membrane proteins. A membrane exhibits functional properties largely depending on its lipid composition and on its structural organization, which very often involves cholesterol-rich microdomains. Then there is the appealing possibility that cholesterol may regulate its own transmembrane transport at a purely functional level, independently of any transcriptional regulation based on cholesterol-sensitive nuclear factors controling the expression level of lipid transport proteins. Indeed, the main cholesterol "transporters" presently believed to mediate for instance the intestinal absorption of cholesterol, that are SR-BI, NPC 1 L 1, ABCA 1, ABCG 1, ABCG 5 /G 8 and even P-glycoprotein, all present privileged functional relationships with membrane cholesterol-containing microdomains. In particular, they all more or less clearly induce membrane disorganization, supposed to facilitate cholesterol exchanges with the close aqueous medium. The actual lipid <b>substrates</b> <b>handled</b> by these transporters are not yet unambiguously determined, but they likely concern the components of membrane microdomains. Conversely, raft alterations may provide specific modulations of the transporter activities, as well as they can induce indirect effects via local perturbations of the membrane.

To that end, 12 male subjects aged 44 - 56 performed one hour of one-legged cycling at 50 % W(max). Muscle biopsies were taken from the exercising and non-exercising leg before and immediately after exercise and analyzed by microarray. One-legged cycling raised plasma lactate, free fatty acids, cortisol, noradrenalin, and adrenalin levels. Surprisingly, acute endurance exercise not only caused pronounced gene expression changes in exercising muscle but also in non-exercising muscle. In the exercising leg the three most highly induced genes were all part of the NR 4 A family. Remarkably, many genes induced in non-exercising muscle were PPAR targets or related to PPAR signalling, including PDK 4, ANGPTL 4 and SLC 22 A 5. Pathway analysis confirmed this finding. In conclusion, our data indicate that acute endurance exercise elicits pronounced changes in gene expression in non-exercising muscle, which are likely mediated by changes in circulating factors such as free fatty acids.
