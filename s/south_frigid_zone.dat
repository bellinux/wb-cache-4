50|$|The two <b>Frigid</b> <b>Zones,</b> or polar regions, {{experience}} the midnight {{sun and the}} polar night {{for part of the}} year - {{at the edge of the}} zone there is one day at the winter solstice when the Sun is invisible, and one day at the summer solstice when the sun remains above the horizon for 24 hours. In the center of the zone (the pole) the day is one year long with six months of daylight and six months of night. The <b>Frigid</b> <b>Zones</b> are the coldest regions of Earth and are generally covered in ice and snow.|$|R
2500|$|Based {{on their}} {{experience}} of the Torrid Zone south of Egypt and Libya, the Greek geographers judged it uninhabitable. Symmetry requires that there be an uninhabitable <b>Frigid</b> <b>Zone</b> (katepsugmenē, [...] "frozen") {{to the north and}} reports from there since the time of Homer seemed to confirm it. The edge of the <b>Frigid</b> <b>Zone</b> ought to be as far south from the North Pole in latitude as the Summer Tropic is from the Equator. Strabo gives it as 24°, which may be based on a previous tangent of Pytheas, but he does not say. The Arctic Circle would then be at 66°, accurate to within a degree.|$|R
50|$|The {{order is}} a cosmopolite (plants found {{throughout}} most of the world including desert and <b>frigid</b> <b>zones),</b> and includes mostly herbaceous species, although a small number of trees (such as the giant Lobelia and the giant Senecio) and shrubs are also present.|$|R
60|$|The central region, lying {{beneath the}} {{track of the}} sun, was termed the torrid zone; the two regions between the tropics and the polar circles were termed the {{temperate}} zones, and the remaining parts, between the porlar circles and the poles, the <b>frigid</b> <b>zones.</b>|$|R

50|$|The polar {{regions of}} Earth, {{also known as}} Earth's <b>frigid</b> <b>zones,</b> are the regions of Earth {{surrounding}} its geographical poles (the North and South Poles).

50|$|The flora at the Mt.

60|$|In this way, {{it would}} seem {{inevitable}} that the surface waters of {{the northern and southern}} <b>frigid</b> <b>zones</b> must, sooner or later, find their way {{to the bottom of the}} rest of the ocean; and there accumulate to a thickness dependent on the rate at which they absorb heat from the crust of the earth below, and from the surface water above.|$|R

5000|$|The {{concepts}} of symmetry, equilibrium and cyclic repetition permeated Aristotle's work. In his Meteorology he divided {{the world into}} five climatic zones: two temperate areas separated by a torrid zone near the equator, and two cold inhospitable regions, [...] "one near our upper or northern pole and the other near the ... southern pole," [...] both impenetrable and girdled with ice (Meteorologica, 362a31-35). Although no humans could survive in the <b>frigid</b> <b>zones,</b> inhabitants in the southern temperate regions could exist.|$|R
50|$|Areas {{inside each}} polar circle and its {{associated}} pole (North Pole or South Pole), known geographically as the <b>frigid</b> <b>zones,</b> would theoretically experience at least one 24-hour period {{when the sun is}} continuously above the horizon and at least one 24-hour period when the sun is continuously below the horizon annually. However, due to atmospheric refraction and the Sun being an extended object rather than a point source, the continuous daylight area is somewhat extended while the continuous darkness area is somewhat reduced.|$|R
6000|$|The apple-tree (Pyrus malus) belongs chiefly to the {{northern}} temperate zone. Loudon says, that [...] "it grows spontaneously {{in every part of}} Europe except the <b>frigid</b> <b>zone,</b> and throughout Western Asia, China, and Japan." [...] We have also two or three varieties of the apple indigenous in North America. The cultivated apple-tree was first introduced into this country by the earliest settlers, and is thought to do as well or better here than anywhere else. Probably some of the varieties which are now cultivated were first introduced into Britain by the Romans.|$|R
60|$|Saturday, July 9. Rose in a {{blaze of}} glory. Rode five mortal hours in a char-à-banc, sweltering under a burning sun. But in less than ten minutes after we mounted the mules and struck into the gorge, the ladies muffled {{themselves}} in thick shawls. We seemed to have passed, almost in a moment, from the tropics into the <b>frigid</b> <b>zone.</b> A fur cloak was suggested to me, but as it happened I was adequately calorified without. Chancing to be the last in the file, my mule suddenly stopped to eat.|$|R

The {{carriages}} in the streets are few, and other late sounds in that neighbourhood there are none, unless a man so very nomadically drunk as to stray into the <b>frigid</b> <b>zone</b> goes brawling and bellowing along the pavement. Upon this wintry night it is so still that listening to the intense silence is like looking at intense darkness. If any distant sound be audible in this case, it departs through the gloom like a feeble light in that, and all is heavier than before.|$|R

5000|$|Midges are a {{group of}} insects that include many kinds of small flies. They are found (seasonally or otherwise) on {{practically}} every land area outside permanently arid deserts and the <b>frigid</b> <b>zones.</b> The term [...] "midge" [...] does not define any particular taxonomic group, but includes species in several families of Nematoceran Diptera. Some midges, such as many Phlebotominae (sand fly) and Simuliidae (black fly), are vectors of various diseases. Many others play useful roles as prey items for insectivores, such as various frogs and swallows. Others are important as detritivores, participating in various nutrient cycles. The habits of midges vary greatly from species to species, though within any particular family, midges commonly have similar ecological roles.|$|R
60|$|Soon after this, {{signs of}} {{approaching}} winter {{began to make}} their appearance in the regions of the North Pole. The sun, which at first had been as a familiar friend night and day, had begun to absent himself not only all night, but during {{a large portion of}} each day, giving sure though quiet hints of his intention to forsake the region altogether, and leave it to the six months' reign of night. Frost began to render the nights bitterly cold. The birds, having brought forth and brought up their young, were betaking themselves to more temperate regions, leaving only such creatures as bears, seals, walruses, foxes, wolves, and men, to enjoy, or endure, the regions of the <b>frigid</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|R

60|$|Sometimes our fate grows too homely and familiarly serious {{ever to be}} cruel. Consider how {{for three}} months the human destiny is wrapped in furs.

Their praises have never been sung, only their wrath deprecated. The best scripture, after all, records but a meagre faith. Its saints live reserved and austere.

40|$|The Torrid Zone, more casually {{referred}} to as the tropics, has been discriminated against since Aristotle divided the world into three zones. The tropics have been considered too hot for civilised habitation, a place of great horrors, and a dangerous place of pestilence. Consequently, others have chosen to explore the Temperate and <b>Frigid</b> <b>zones.</b> However, the tropics has become an increasingly critical global zone. With a huge, and rapidly growing, population it is facing some of the most formidable issues in history, including the impact of climate change and environmental degradation, poor health and educational outcomes, extreme poverty, and political and economic instability. This article advocates for the tropics to be recognised as a major expanding geo-political region that needs to be comprehensively understood by psychology and other disciplines through research and investigation...|$|R

50|$|The {{distinction}} between felted and other fibrous materials {{is not always}} sharp. For example, although truly felted hair on healthy mammals is unusual, many animals, especially in seasonally cold or wet climates or environments, often have a so-called undercoat of down hair plus awn hair that usually lies hidden beneath the outer coat of guard hairs, and may form a mat of lightly felted wool. Such down hairs as a rule are crimped into a finely woolly texture and contain waxy, water-repellent lanolin; in a mass they serve to retain insulating air and exclude water. In many species that live in seasonally <b>frigid</b> <b>zones</b> the winter down hair is shed in clumps during springtime. This is exploited in species such as the muskox; herders collect the wool for commercial purposes without any need for shearing.|$|R
2500|$|Pytheas sailed northward {{with the}} intent of {{locating}} the Arctic Circle and exploring the [...] "frigid zone" [...] to the north of it at the extreme of the earth. He did not know the latitude of the circle in degrees. All he had to go by was the definition of the <b>frigid</b> <b>zone</b> as the latitudes north of the line where the celestial arctic circle was equal to the celestial Tropic of Cancer, the tropikos kuklos (refer to the next subsection). Strabo's angular report of this line as being at 24° may well be based on a tangent known to Pytheas, but he does not say that. In whatever mathematical form Pytheas knew the location, he could only have determined when he was there by taking periodic readings of the elevation of the pole (eksarma tou polou in Strabo and others).|$|R
60|$|Water beats {{upon the}} rocks of the sea-shore until it pounds them into sand, or rolls them into pebbles and boulders. It also sweeps the rich soil from the {{mountains}} into the valleys. In the form of snow it clothes {{the surface of the}} temperate and <b>frigid</b> <b>zones</b> with a warm mantle, which preserves vegetable life from the killing frosts of winter. In the form of ice it splits asunder the granite hills; and in the northern regions it forms great glaciers, or masses of solidified snow, many miles in extent, and many hundred feet thick. These glaciers descend by slow, imperceptible degrees, to the sea; their edges break off and fall into it, and, floating southward, sometimes in great mountainous masses, are seen by man in the shape of icebergs. Frequently huge rocks, that have fallen upon these glaciers from cliffs in the arctic regions, are carried by them to other regions, and are deposited on flat beaches, far from their native cliffs.|$|R
6000|$|This stern {{resolve to}} hold aloof did not last. Towards {{the end of}} the session a subject was brought before {{parliament}} that stirred him to the very depths of heart and conscience. It marked one more stage of the history of English laws in that immense process of the secularisation of the state, against which, in his book of 1888, Mr. Gladstone had drawn up, with so much weight of reading and thought, a case so wholly unavailing. The legal doctrine of marriage had been established against the theological doctrine by Lord Hardwicke's famous act of 1753, for that measure made the observance of certain requirements then set up by law essential to a good marriage. A further fundamental change had begun with the legislation of civil marriage in 1836. The conception of marriage underlying such a change obviously removed it from sacrament, or anything like a sacrament, to the bleak and <b>frigid</b> <b>zone</b> of civil contract; it was antagonistic, therefore, to the whole ecclesiastical theory of divorce.[363] ...|$|R
60|$|I {{would like}} you to provide a proper outfit and start north as soon as I {{telegraph}} you, be it night or be it day.

It is my intention to move one of the tropics up there and transfer the <b>frigid</b> <b>zone</b> to the equator. I will have the entire Arctic Circle in the market as a summer resort next year, and will use the surplusage of the old climate, over and above what can be utilized on the equator, to reduce the temperature of opposition resorts.

5000|$|When {{he wakes}} up, Carson discovers {{he appears to}} be in a city built in the {{enormous}} tree boles. He dresses in his overall, in spite of the heat. His hosts offer him breakfast. During the course of the meal he tries to learn his first few words of the language. The men of the house are named Duran, Olthar and Kamlot. The women are Zuro and Alzo. After breakfast, the men take him to another house where a man by the name Tofar leads them to a man called Jong, who appears to have a high social status. Carson is thoroughly examined and then placed in the care of a man called Danus. During the following three weeks Carson learns the language (which is briefly described), history and customs of Amtor, as the Venusians call their planet. Danus also shows a map, pointing out different regions of Amtor: Trabol, Strabol and Karbol. His explanations make it obvious that the Amtoran view of the world is very limited... and backward. They think Amtor is the inside of a hemispheric bowl floating on a sea of lava (which occasionally comes out of Venus' volcanoes), with Strabol (the torrid zone) {{in the center of the}} bowl and Karbol (the <b>frigid</b> <b>zone</b> of Trabol's hemisphere) on the rim. Neither Strabol nor Karbol have been much explored due to their respective hazards, and Carson realizes that Danus is showing him an incomplete, and faulty, azimuthal projection of either Venus' northern or southern hemisphere (Carson later deduces it is the southern). Carson tries to explain that it is the other way around, that they are on the outside of a sphere, and that their surveys should have made clear that the line of latitude bordering the <b>frigid</b> <b>zone</b> should be considerably smaller than the line of latitude bordering the torrid. Danus admits that their surveys do support Carson, but explains that a scientist named Klufar had remedied this apparent discrepancy by inventing and applying the imaginary unit. Carson muses about how crucial astronomy was to Earth navigation and mapping. On Venus, the clouds are seen as protection from the [...] "fire" [...] above; rare rifts in the clouds occasionally expose the [...] "fire" [...] (sun), or, at night, the fire's [...] "sparks" [...] (stars).|$|R
