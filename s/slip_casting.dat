50|$|This {{production}} {{operation is}} well known for providing tools with dimensional stability, surface quality, density and uniformity. For instance, on the <b>slip</b> <b>casting</b> process the cast part is of high concentration of raw materials with little additive, this improves uniformity. But also, the plaster mould draws water from the poured slip to compact and form the casting at the mould surface. This forms a dense cast.|$|E
50|$|Magnetically-assisted <b>slip</b> <b>casting</b> is a {{manufacturing}} technique that uses anisotropic stiff nanoparticle platelets in a ceramic, metal or polymer functional matrix to produce layered objects that can mimic natural {{objects such as}} nacre.

40|$|Modulus of Rupture (MOR) {{measurements}} were conducted {{at room temperature}} on <b>slip</b> <b>cast</b> amorphous silica bar (50 mm xD 7; 8 mm xD 7; 6 mm) specimens. The resultant MOR values were then statistically analysed employing the Weibull statistical procedure. It was found that a scatter always exists in the measured MOR values due to the inherent statistical nature of flow distribution {{in the case of}} monolithic ceramic specimens. The variability of measured MOR values was modelled using the well-known Weibull statistics. A population (n) of 68 bars was used for Weibull analysis and a Weibull modulus of m = 5. 4 was obtained for the total set of all the specimens. The test specimens were generated by slicing from a single <b>slip</b> <b>cast</b> and sintered amorphous silica block (50 mm xD 7; 50 mm xD 7; 160 mm). An improved Weibull modulus value could be achieved by adopting this procedure as compared to the authors' earlier studies where the test specimens of the size 50 mm xD 7; 8 mm xD 7; 6 mm were individually processed (<b>slip</b> <b>cast</b> and sintered) and then subjected to MOR test...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE. The {{flexural}} strength of Cerec 2 InCeram-Alumina and InCeram-Zirconia bars is evaluated. The {{focus of the}} in vitro study is to identify a jointing procedure for InCeram which {{may be used for}} producing full-ceramic fixed-partial-denture frameworks. METHODS. Six groups (n= 15) of machined and jointed InCeram-Alumina (T 1 -T 5) and InCeram-Zirconia (T 6) bars (3 x 4 x 13 mm(3)), respectively, were examined using a 3 -point-bending test. InCeram-Alumina joint-free controls were: machined (C 1), <b>slip</b> <b>cast</b> (C 2, C 3) and cut from the block (C 4) bars. Machined joint-free InCeram-Zirconia bars were used as controls (C 5). InCeram-Alumina slip was used for jointing T 1 -T 5 and InCeram-Zirconia slip for bars T 6. Bars were jointed in groups T 1 and T 2 using butt joint (S 1), in T 3 and T 4 oblique (S 2, S 3) and in T 5 and T 6 rounded (S 4) joint shapes. RESULTS. Two-way analysis of variance showed significant differences between materials (p 0. 05) were found between machined/jointed InCeram-Zirconia (475 (54) MPa, T 6), joint-free InCeram-Alumina <b>slip</b> <b>cast</b> (498 (125) MPa, C 2) and joint-free InCeram-Alumina machined bars (511 (59) MPa, C 1).

50|$|Aluminium {{oxynitride}} spinel (Al23O27N5), abbreviated as AlON, {{is one of}} {{the leading}} candidates for transparent armor. It is produced by the Surmet Corporation under the trademark ALON. The incorporation of nitrogen into aluminium oxide stabilizes a crystalline spinel phase, which due to its cubic crystal structure and unit cell, is an isotropic material which can be produced as transparent ceramic nanomaterial. Thus, fine-grained polycrystalline nanomaterials can be produced and formed into complex geometries using conventional ceramic forming techniques such as hot pressing and <b>slip</b> <b>casting.</b>|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} forming {{techniques}} to make ceramics, but {{one example is}} slipcasting. This is where slip, liquid clay, is poured into a plaster mould. The water in the slip is drawn out of the slip, leaving an inside layer of solid clay. When this is thick enough, the excess slip can {{be removed from the}} mould. When dry, the solid clay can then also be removed. The slip used in <b>slip</b> <b>casting</b> is often liquified with a substance that reduces the need for additional water to soften the slip; this prevents excessive shrinkage which occurs when a piece containing a lot of water dries.|$|E
50|$|Transparent {{crystalline}} ceramics {{are used}} to defeat advanced threats. Three major transparent candidates currently exist: aluminum oxynitride (AlON), magnesium aluminate spinel (spinel), and single crystal aluminum oxide (sapphire). Aluminum oxynitride spinel (Al23O27N5), {{one of the leading}} candidates for transparent armor, is produced by Surmet Corporation as AlON and marketed under the trade name ALON. The incorporation of nitrogen into an aluminum oxide stabilizes a spinel phase, which due to its cubic crystal structure, is an isotropic material that can be produced as a transparent polycrystalline material.

5000|$|Later low-quality clay pipes {{were made}} by <b>slip</b> <b>casting</b> in a mould. Higher quality pipes are made in a {{labour-intensive}} hand shaping process. Traditionally, clay pipes are un-glazed. Clays burn [...] "hot" [...] in comparison to other types of pipes, so they are often difficult for most pipe-smokers to use. Their proponents claim that, unlike other materials, a well-made clay pipe gives a [...] "pure" [...] smoke with no flavour addition from the pipe bowl. In addition to aficionados, reproductions of historical clay styles are used by some historical re-enactors. Clay pipes were once considered disposable items and the rapidly changing designs in the past are often used as an aid in dating by archaeologists.

5000|$|Pressure casting: Specially {{developed}} {{polymeric materials}} allow a mould {{to be subject}} to application external pressures of up to 4.0 MPa-so much higher than <b>slip</b> <b>casting</b> in plaster moulds where the capillary forces correspond to a pressure of around 0.1 - 0.2 MPa. The high pressure leads to much faster casting rates and, hence, faster production cycles. Furthermore, the application of high pressure air through the polymeric moulds upon demoulding the cast means a new casting cycle can be started immediately in the same mould, unlike plaster moulds which require lengthy drying times. The polymeric materials have much greater durability than plaster and, therefore, it is possible to achieve shaped products with better dimensional tolerances and much longer mould life. Pressure casting was developed in the 1970s for the production of sanitaryware although, more recently, it has been applied to tableware.|$|E

The <b>slip</b> <b>cast</b> samples sintered by CRH and 2 SS have achieved 98 - 99 % of theoretical densities while RCS samples have exhibited a low density of 97 %.

Controlled pore growth associated with RCS, when compared to CRH methodology is mainly responsible for the relatively smaller grain size observed with RCS. A four fold decrease in grain size i. e. 2. 64 μm observed with the two step sintering {{can be attributed to}} the fact that the first heating step to high temperature of 1550 °C for a shorter duration closes the porosity without significant grain growth.

The main objective of the research is to formulate a <b>casting</b> <b>slip</b> {{that could be used}} for its whiteness and thinness as well as maintain a level of strength. I began by experimenting with different formulations of <b>casting</b> <b>slip.</b> By testing combinations of different percentages of raw clay components, certain qualities can be amplified. An investigation of various papers, wire, and wax for surface development began in hopes of finding additional creative opportunities. Tea bag paper, as well as rice paper is utilized to construct armatures onto which the <b>casting</b> <b>slip</b> is applied. By brushing <b>casting</b> <b>slip</b> on the surface of the paper I am able to ascertain how much slip would crack and fall off prior to firing, which would also indicate whether the work would survive a kiln firing. Firing samples of wire at various temperatures tests the wires durability and level of heat resistance. These <b>casting</b> <b>slips</b> are based on porcelain clay bodies, which are white upon being kiln-fired.
