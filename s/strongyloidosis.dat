40|$|<b>Strongyloidosis</b> is a chronic, soil-transmitted, {{intestinal}} parasitic disease. Strongyloides stercoralis is a roundworm and {{the main}} causative agent of this disease. S. stercoralis has a unique life cycle, which consists of direct (homogonic) development and indirect (heterogonic) development. Parasitic adult females produce both sexes {{of the next generation}} parthenogenetically. Female larvae can choose the direct or indirect development depending on various environmental conditions. Autoinfection is one of the characteristic features of this parasite, which causes hyperinfection and disseminated infection. <b>Strongyloidosis</b> occurs mostly in humid tropics and subtropics of more than 70 countries, affecting people between 30 million and 100 million or higher. However, the precise number is not known up to the present, because of difficulties in diagnosis. Even in highly developed countries, like the USA, serious problems have been caused by transmission of S. stercoralis through organ transplantation. We describe the current status of <b>strongyloidosis</b> with special reference to biology, epidemiology, immunology, and vaccine development...|$|E
40|$|Immunocompromised {{individuals}} {{infected with}} Strongyloides stercoralis may develop severe hyperinfection or disseminated disease with high mortality. Patients with hematological malignancies {{are at risk}} because of immunodepression produced either by the disease or its treatment. A prospective study was undertaken at the Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre, from July 1994 to July 1995. Seventy-two (HIV negative), had 3 stool samples collected at different days and had not received recent anti-helmintic therapy. Larvae, isolated in a modified Baermann method, were found in 6 patients, with a resultant prevalence of 8. 3 %. No complicated <b>strongyloidosis</b> was documented. The positive result for S. stercoralis larvae was significantly associated (p < 0. 001) with eosinophilia. Knowledge of prevalence figures and incidence of severe disease is important to adequate guidelines for empirical treatment besides the rigorous search for <b>strongyloidosis</b> in patients with hematological malignancies...|$|E
40|$|Strongyloides stercoralis chronic {{infections are}} usually {{asymptomatic}} and underestimated. We used direct fresh stool examination, Ritchie's method, and agar plate culture for diagnosis {{in patients with}} eosinophilia and previous residence in endemic areas. The frequency of <b>strongyloidosis</b> detected among these patients was high: 21 of 42 were positive. Among them, 10 were positive only by agar plate culture. After ivermectin treatment, patients resulted negative for parasitological tests and reduced their eosinophil counts. Half of the submitted patients that were followed 4 – 12 months after treatment remained negative without eosinophilia, except one who showed an eosinophil ascending curve before reappearance of larvae in stools. The high frequency of <b>strongyloidosis</b> found in this group emphasizes the relevance of including this parasitosis among differential diagnosis in patients with eosinophilia and past risk of S. stercoralis infection to prevent disseminated infections secondary to corticoid therapy...|$|E
40|$|Travelers to {{developing}} countries may be exposed to several infectious pathogens sometimes leading to complications after a long latency period. Screening of asymptomatic returning travelers is only justified in case of specific risks during travel or after a long tropical stay (> 3 months). Based mainly on the history taking of risk patterns, some occult infections have to be looked for: tuberculosis, sexual transmitted infections and some parasitic conditions (schistosomiasis, amebiasis, <b>strongyloidosis,</b> [...] .). Post-travel screening is most effective about 3 months after return, and {{may be even more}} beneficial if associated with screening of major western morbidities and preventive counseling for future travels...|$|E
40|$|Bacteriuria due to Salmonella typhi usually occurs {{following}} recent {{typhoid fever}} or in chronic carrier states. Data from 18 patients with S. typhi bacteriuria, seen during 5 years, were analyzed. Fourteen patients had localized {{urinary tract infection}} due to S. typhi. Four others had bacteriuria, probably associated with typhoid fever. Localized abnormalities of the urinary tract and kidneys and also systemic diseases were found to predispose patients to S. typhi bacteriuria. Local abnormalities encountered included urolithiasis (n = 3), prostatic hypertrophy (n = 1), and tuberculosis (n = 1). One renal transplant recipient and another with lupus nephritis had S. typhi bacteriuria. One had associated <b>strongyloidosis,</b> and another was pregnant...|$|E
40|$|SummaryIn {{developing}} countries, Strongyloides stercoralis {{infection is}} a common cause of morbidity and mortality. Death from <b>strongyloidosis</b> can result from hyperinfection or disseminated disease. Infections due to S. stercoralis are unusual in Saudi Arabia and are usually diagnosed in immigrants from endemic areas. We report {{a case in which}} S. stercoralis was isolated from the sputum of a patient with Gram-negative sepsis and respiratory failure, and review the salient features of this disease. A high index of suspicion should be maintained by clinicians treating patients in endemic areas presenting with new-onset wheezing, acute respiratory distress and/or Gram-negative sepsis to prevent the serious complications of Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination...|$|E
40|$|The parasitologic {{investigation}} performed without clinical {{orientation in}} a routine laboratory allowed {{to identify the}} most common parasites, often cysts of protozoa, using a minimal technique. A more accurate investigation (e. g. : concentration, extraction and flotation) was hampered by a too large number of systematic specimens. The use of an immersion objective improves the detection and identification of cysts of protozoa. There is still some controversy on the virulence of small amoebae, flagellates, Blastocystis and Entamoeba coli, the infection being often massive. AIDS should predispose to new parasitic diseases such as cryptosporidiosis and <b>strongyloidosis.</b> A careful examination of stools for parasites has become mandatory {{in view of the}} wide geographical origin of patients with a parasitic disease...|$|E
40|$|Achatina fulica or "giant African snail" is {{an exotic}} species, {{considered}} {{to be one of}} the world's hundred most invasive species, causing serious environmental damages. In the present study we report, for the first time, the occurrence of Aelurostrongylus abstrusus infecting A. fulica in the Amazon region. This nematode is described parasitizing mainly the pulmonary system of felines, which causes "aelurostrongilose", also known as feline cardio-pulmonary <b>strongyloidosis.</b> New morphometric data of third stage larvae are presented herein. The present study demonstrated that 40 % of all the snails were infected by A. abstrusus. Achatina fulica specimens were collected from three different areas in Manaus namely: rural; east and west areas. The east area presents the highest prevalence of 80 %. The large number of A. fulica found in inhabited areas increases the chances of emergent zoonoses, which highlights the need of further studies so as to better control this disease...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} industrially prepared Western blot strips {{designed to}} avoid the cross-reactions observed with indirect immunofluorescence and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays used for the serodiagnosis of trichinellosis. The antigen preparations were crude extracts of Trichinella spiralis. The Western blot profile characteristic of trichinellosis was characterized by comparing 60 sera from patients infected by Trichinella to 11 sera from healthy subjects, 51 sera from patients with other proven parasitic diseases (cysticercosis, schistosomiasis, <b>strongyloidosis,</b> fascioliasis, toxocariasis, liver amebiasis, anisakiasis, filariasis, toxoplasmosis, hydatidosis, or malaria), and 23 sera from patients with autoantibodies. Specific 43 - to 44 -kDa and 64 -kDa bands were obtained {{with all of the}} sera from 51 patients with acute trichinellosis, in 4 out of 9 patients at {{the early stages of the}} disease, and in only 1 control patient, who had suspected anisakiasis and in whom trichinellosis could not be ruled out by muscle biopsy...|$|E
40|$|A {{familiar}} outbrake of <b>strongyloidosis</b> affected peruvian {{immigrants who}} had arrived Chile in november 2001 is reported. In march 2002, Strongyloides stercoralis infection of the index individual was confirmed by the Basic-Clinical Laboratory of Parasitology of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Chile, in Santiago, Chile. At the Roberto del Río Pediatric Hospital, all years old girl presenting juvenil rheumatoid arthritis and mild abdominal distress was studied. A serial of three stool samples was collected and procesed by ether-centrifugal concentration technique. A plentiful quantity of rhabditoid larvae of S. stercoralis was observed. To detect larvae in the faeces and specific serum antibodies against S. stercoralis by means of ELISA her parents and sister were studied. The mother of the index case and her sister were positive in both test. The father was not infected. The three positive cases were treated with lvermectine.

40|$|Background: Strongyloides stercoralis is {{a common}} {{parasitic}} nematode in Iran, especially in north of the country. The early {{diagnosis and treatment of}} S. stercoralis is crucial to prevent complicated cases of strongyloidiasis. The value of the preference of agar plate culture, in detection of S. stercoralis compared to formalin ether concentration method, reported in different studies in the world is variable from 1. 6 to 6 times. Therefore, the current study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of agar plate on some isolates from north of Iran. Methods: Nine hundred stool samples were randomly collected from rural areas of Mazandaran Province, northern Iran. All samples were examined by agar plate culture, formalin ether concentration and direct smear. Results: Agar plate was 2 times superior to formalin ether; however, it showed some false negative results, too. The direct method could only detect cases of hyperinfection <b>strongyloidosis.</b> Conclusion: On the whole, combination of agar plate culture and formalin ether concentration is recommended to obtain higher efficacy...|$|E
40|$|AbstractStrongyloidiasis is a {{life-threatening}} parasitic infection, especially in immunosuppressed patients, with death often occurring within several days. The disease has a worldwide distribution and is endemic in tropical and subtropical regions. Therefore, {{this study was}} conducted to investigate seroepidemiology of Strongyloides infection amongst immunocompromised patients in Southwest Iran. This cross-sectional study was conducted amongst a population of immunocompromised patients who were referred to health care or hospital referral centres in Ahvaz, Southwest Iran. Serum samples were tested by an enzyme immunoassay for anti-IgG Strongyloides antibody. Anti-Strongyloides stercoralis antibody was detected in 39 of 270 immunocommpromised cases, yielding a prevalence of 14. 4 %. No significant differences were indicated in terms of gender, age, or type of immunocompromised disorder with anti-Strongyloides stercoralis antibody levels. In conclusion, our results demonstrated high seroepidemiology of infection with this parasite in the region. Therefore, it appears immunocompromised patients should be tested for this infection using sensitive tests. However, current research underscores that <b>strongyloidosis</b> must not be neglected, and further assessments in high risk population are warranted...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Strongyloidosis</b> is a {{parasitosis}} {{caused by}} a nematode Strongyloides stercoralis. It is endemic in tropical and subtropical regions, but rarely encountered in temperate areas. Most patients present with non-specific symptoms or they have no symptoms. The disease evolves into hyperinfection syndrome or disseminated disease in immunocompromised patients characterized by high mortality rates. Early diagnosis and effective treatment are of major importance. Drugs such as mebendazol and albendazol are used in therapy. Antibiotics are used for possible concurrent bacterial infections. Patient and the methods: We present {{the case of a}} 73 -year-old woman who has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease receiving corticosteroid therapy. She was complaining about chronic abdominal discomfort characterized by intermittent diarrhoea and constipation. Occasionally, she was presenting with red rash. The laboratory findings: eosinophilia, anemia and a positive hematest in a stool specimen. The eggs and larvae of the parasite were identified by the procedures of biopsy and histological examination of duodenal mucosa. The parasite was found in sputum, too – the proof of the invasion into the lungs. Conclusions: The patient was treated with mebendazol and albendazol. The examination of successive stool and sputum specimens after the treatment showed no eggs or larvae. </p...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{progress}} {{in understanding the}} role of nitric oxide (NO) in the pathogenesis of helminth infections, the role in <b>strongyloidosis</b> is unknown. Firstly, we studied the production of NO in mice infected with Strongyloides venezuelensis {{as well as in}} macrophage cultures stimulated with parasite antigens. Somatic larvae 3 (L 3) and excretory-secretory female antigens stimulate specific NO production measured by Griess reaction and expression of inducible NO synthase by RT-PCR and quantitative PCR. Moreover, mice infected with S. Â venezuelensis produce NO in migration stages. Secondly, we analysed the effect of NO production on L 3 and females of S. Â venezuelensis using NO donors such as diethylenetriamine and 3, 3 -bis(aminoethyl) - 1 -hydroxy- 2 -oxo- 1 -triazene. Parasites died after NO donor treatment in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, apoptotic mechanisms are involved in the death of S. Â venezuelensis larvae.

40|$|Background: Regarding that {{accurate}} {{diagnosis of}} human hydatidosis still needs more investigations, {{the present study}} was conducted to clone, express, and evaluate the gene encoding AgB subunits (EgAgB 16 kDa) from Echinococcus granulosus (Iranian G 1 strain) and its evaluation by ELISA test. Methods: DNA was extracted from protoscoleces and was utilized by PCR for strain identification. Total RNA was prepared with RNeasy protect mini kit from E. granulosus (Iranian G 1 strain) protoscoleces collected from naturally infected sheep with hydatid cyst. Recombinant AgB 16 kDa was produced using pETDuet as vector and evaluated by ELISA method. A panel of sera including hydatid cyst-infected individu­als (n= 72), healthy individual (n= 48), toxoplasmosis (n= 4), <b>strongyloidosis</b> (n= 4), kala-azar (n= 5) and tuberculosis (n= 5) were examined using this recombinant antigen. Results: Recombinant protein was purified by affinity chromatography using His-Tag column. After purifica­tion, recombinant protein was confirmed by western blot analysis using His Tag monoclonal anti­body or hydatid positive human serum. The sensitivity, specificity; positive and negative predictive values were calculated as 93. 5 %, 95. 6 %, 96 % and 92. 9 %, in that order. The cut-off point was detected 0. 3 for rAgB 16.

40|$|Fast enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (Fast-ELISA) was {{compared}} with the standard ELISA for the diagnosis of human hydatidosis. Seventy serum samples including 30 from hydatidosis patients (surgically confirmed), healthy control individuals not infected with any parasitic diseases (n=/ 20) and from others with different parasitic infections including, toxocariosis (n= 5), fasciolosis (n= 5), trichostrongylosis (n= 5), and <b>strongyloidosis</b> (n= 5) were analysed for anti-hydatid IgG antibodies using sheep hydatid cyst fluid antigen. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, as well as {{validity of the test}} were found as 96. 7 %, 95. 2 %, 93. 7 %, 97. 5 % and 96 % for conventional ELISA, while these paramters for fast-ELISA were respectively as follows: 100 %, 97. 5 %, 96. 7 %, 100 % and 98. 8 %. Regarding standard-ELISA 3 µg/ml of antigen, serum dilution of 1 : 500, conjugate dilution of 1 : 3000 and 30 min incubation were found optimal, while for fast-ELISA 3 µg/ml of antigen, serum dilution of 1 : 125, conjugate dilution of 1 : 1000 and 5 min incubation were utilized. The present study indicates that fast ELISA can easily be performed in place of the standard ELISA for the serodiagnosis of human hydatidosis with the advantage of minimising consumed time and manpower hours. Moreover, this test can be utilized in screening tests to diagnos human hydatidosis...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Hypereosinophilic {{syndrome}} (HES) is a {{group of}} idiopathic disorders associated with single or multiple organ system dysfunction. HES must be distinguished from reactive eosinophilia in parasitic infections, allergic diseases, and especially from hematological diseases of clonal origin. Reactive eosinophilia due to infectious and parasitic diseases. Tissue helminth infections, especially toxocariasis, cause severe and long-standing hypereosinophilia. Despite specific therapy, eosinophilia may persist for over a year after diagnosis, and decreases slowly. Other helminth infections, such as trichinellosis, <b>strongyloidosis,</b> and rarely taeniasis and cysticercosis may also be diagnosed in patients with eosinophilia. Hematologic and other neoplastic diseases. Numerous neoplastic diseases, like Hodgkin's and other malignant lymphomas, myeloproliferative diseases, systemic mastocytosis etc., may be associated with marked eosinophilia. We had two patients with clinical and histological features resembling chronic eosinophilic leukemia, and many others with T-cell lymphoma, planocellular or adenocarcinoma etc. where eosinophilia persisted. Drug-induced eosinophilia. Drugs associated with eosinophilia include penicillins, tetracyclines, especially minocycline, clarithromycin, tetrazepam, mefloquine, and many others. Toxins associated with L-tryptophan cause eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome and toxic oil syndrome, also belonging in this group. Treatment includes drug discontinuation and administration of corticosteroids. Hypereosinophilia with organ dysfunction. Many severe diseases, such as sarcoidosis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, pemphigus vulgaris, eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases, inflammatory bowel disease and many others are associated with hypereosinophilia and target organ damage, e. g. involvement of the heart, lungs, skin, or nervous tissue. Conclusion. Eosinophilia can be classified as either familial or acquired. Hypereosinophilic syndrome is a subcategory of idiopathic eosinophilia. If the differential diagnosis of hypereosinophilia fails to resolve the etiology succesfully, the diagnosis of idiopathic HES remains...|$|E

40|$|That {{eosinophilia}} {{is associated}} with hookworm disease and <b>strongyloidosis</b> {{has been known for}} a very long time. The details of this association, however, have not been fully worked out. The data presented here may help to fill some of the gaps in this knowledge, and may show how the demonstration of the eosinophilia may be of value to the epidemiologist as an index of hookworm or Strongyloides infection under the following conditions: 1. The infection must be relatively recent (within one year). The waxing and waning of eosinophilia relative to the time of infection are discussed below. 2. Other conditions causing eosinophilia must be relatively unimportant. This method may not be applicable to troops evacuated at certain seasons from such places as Guam or the coastal region of India 2 where "epidemic asthma " or "tropical eosinophilia " exists, unless indeed further investigation reveals these conditions to be manifestations of helminthiasis. Likewise, where schistosomiasis or filariasis is. prevalent, confusion will arise unless incontrovertible evidence of the specific nature of the parasite (or parasites, in the many cases of multiple infection) is forthcoming. 3. Absence of eosinophilia must not be construed to indicate absence of infection, particularly in old cases. Diurnal variations occur, some individuals show slight, if any, eosinophilic response, and certain other conditions, such as malaria (vide infra), may counteract it. Infection with Strot-gyloides stercoralis stood next in frequency to ancylostomiasis among admissions from the Solomon lslands in the 39 th General Hospital New Zealand series. An analysis of the results of all routine stool examinations performed there on hospital patients between 7 February, 1943, and 31 December, @ 1 943, showed that of 633 specimens containing evidence of {{one or the other of}} these diseases, 7. 4 per cent were positive for larvae of the latter...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} the extent of concurrent infection and seasonal distribution of gastrointestinal parasites in cross-bred cattle of Shahzadpur upazila of Sirajganj district, Bangladesh. Materials and Methods: Faecal samples from 4248 cross-bred cattle presented to the diagnostic centre of Milk Vita, Baghabari, Sirajganj with complains of digestive disturbances over the period from November, 2008 to October, 2009 were examined grossly with naked eye followed by microscopic examination with direct smear method, Will's floatation and sedimentation techniques. Results: Out of 4248 faecal samples examined, 3268 (76. 93 %) samples harboured one or more parasitic ova or cyst and the rest 980 (23. 07 %) samples found free of parasitic ova or cyst. Among the positive cases, single infection of fascioliasis (29. 0. 5 %), paramphistomiasis (8. 3 %), toxocariasis (11. 32 %), haemonchosis (2. 47 %), monieziasis (0. 7 %), balantidiasis (4. 19 %), trichuriasis (1. 1 %), trichostrongylosis (1. 4 %) and <b>strongyloidosis</b> (1. 6 %) were diagnosed. Mixed infection with at least two (dual infection) and/ or any three of above mentioned parasitic species (triple infection) were also recorded. Cattle harbouring eggs of one parasite were more common [60. 03 % (95 % Confidence interval (CI) : 58. 53, 61. 51) ] than those harbouring eggs of two [15. 44 % (95 % CI, 14. 36, 16. 56) ] or three [1. 46 % (95 % CI, 1. 12, 1. 87) ] parasites concurrently. Significantly (p 0. 05). A non-significant (p> 0. 005) decreasing trend of occurrence from winter through summer and rainy season was also observed in case of trichostrongylosis. Conclusion: The result of current study clearly indicate that helminth infections are highly prevalent in cross-bred cattle of the study area. The findings on abundance and distribution of gastrointestinal parasitism in different age groups of cattle, the poly-parasitism nature of the disease and the seasonal variation of occurrence obtained from present study will therefore assist the clinicians for forecasting of parasitism and make awareness among the farmers to take appropriate control measures against them...|$|E
40|$|Strongyloides stercoralis is a {{worldwide}} zoonotic parasite, infecting men, {{dogs and cats}} (1). It is the unique among nematodes of veterinary importance that has both a free-living cycle and a parasitic one (2). The parasitic phase is supported entirely by females, localized in the small intestine. In the dog S. stercoralis infection occurs mostly via penetration of skin and mucosal surfaces or by transmammary transmission. Autoinfection occurs as well and, if it is long-lasting in immunosuppressed hosts, massive hyperinfection and even disseminated infection by migrating larvae may occur (3). Autoinfection can induce persistent <b>strongyloidosis</b> in absence of reinfestation from outside. Clinical disease varies from inapparent to severe enteritis and pneumonia to sudden death (2). The in vivo diagnosis is difficult due to the low sensitivity of traditional parasitological methods and {{it is based on}} larvae detection in faecal samples collected from rectal ampulla to overcome the morphological similarities with environmental free living nematode larvae. S. stercoralis is the only Strongyloides species described in naturally infected dogs. Two clinical cases are described. Two male adult dogs from the same kennel were presented with an history of chronic severe diarrhea, weight loss, depression (dog 1) and of reduced appetite, diarrhea and weight loss (dog 2). At clinical examination dog 1 was very thin (BCS 2) and depressed; in dog 2 (BCS 4) a mass was clinically revealed in medium abdomen and its gastrointestinal origin at ileocecocolic junction was identified by ultrasound. A final diagnosis of linfoma was reached by cito/hystology. Dog 1 naturally died after 24 hours from presentation, dog 2 was treated for infection before surgery and monitored. The laboratory alterations common to both dogs at the time of presentation were: leukocytosis, mild anemia, hypoproteinemia and increase of alpha 2 fraction at serum proteins electrophoresis. Eosinophilia was not detected. Diagnosis of S. stercoralis infection was performed by larvae detection and identification in faecal samples collected from ampolla (direct and/or Baermann test) and subsequently by the finding of adult females after scraping of the intestinal mucosa at post-mortem examination. The histological features showed in dog 1 : hemorrhagic parasitic enteritis of moderate-to-severe degree, with the presence of inflammatory linfoplasmocitic exudates in the lamina propria; several adult parasites localized in proximity of the duodenal papilla; a moderate pulmonary atelectasis associated with a moderate interstitial congestion. Dog 2 was treated with febendazole 50 mg/kg/die and metronidazole (25 mg/kg/bid) for 5 consecutive days and monitored for the following ten days. Multiple fecal pool samples from dogs living in same kennel have been examined using Baermann tecnique living negative results to S. stercoralis larvae detection. The clinical cases are discussed focusing on pathogenetic hypothesis (hyperinfection vs patologia concomitante). For authors knowledge S. stercoralis infection in dogs have never been reported in Italy. S. stercoralis is a zoonotic parasite and despite natural transmission between dog and man has been rarely reported (2) the potential role of the dogs as source of human infections ha sto be taken in mind, particularly in kennel where il sovraffollamento e le ridotte condizioni igieniche risultano fattori predisponenti al perpetuarsi dell’infezione. 1 Ferreira JA et al., Vet.
