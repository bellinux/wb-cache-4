5|$|Trapping {{of newly}} emerged insects: By sealing the storage facilities, newly emerged adults from seeds could be {{prevented}} from escaping to their overwintering sites {{to decrease the}} pest pressure at the next season. B. rufimanus could then be trapped and later killed, e.g., by fire. Healthy and damaged seeds can be sorted using an optic <b>sorter.</b> Additionally, a storage extended over two years enables all developing B. rufimanus to emerge before sowing and therefore avoids emergence in the field from contaminated seeds.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a {{wildlife}} monitoring organization, WildTrack, started using JMP with the Footprint Identification Technology (FIT) system to identify individual endangered animals by their footprints. In 2009, the Chicago Botanic Garden used JMP to analyze DNA data from tropical breadfruit. Researchers {{determined that the}} seedless, starchy fruit {{was created by the}} deliberate hybridization of two fruits, the breadnut and the dugdug. The Herzenberg Laboratory at Stanford has integrated JMP with the Fluorescence Activated Cell <b>Sorter</b> (FACS). The FACS system is used to study HIV, cancer, stem-cells and oceanography.|$|E
5|$|Gumball is {{an action}} video {{game for the}} home {{computer}} in which the player works in a factory as a gumball <b>sorter</b> and sorts gumballs by color as they flow through a maze-like processing machine. The player controls valves in the machine to divert the flow of individual gumballs towards bins of corresponding colors. If the player sorts incorrectly, the foreman walks onscreen and dumps the gumballs out the bin. The player has a daily quota to meet {{by the end of}} the level's time limit. If successful, the player character receives a promotion; the player watches an animation of a worker walking home from the factory, and progresses to a more complex level, with more color options to sort and defective, explosive gumballs to deactivate. If unsuccessful in meeting the daily quota, the game ends and the player is left to restart from the beginning.|$|E
50|$|Colour <b>sorters</b> {{or color}} <b>sorters</b> (sometimes called optical <b>sorters</b> or digital <b>sorters</b> or {{electronic}} colour <b>sorters)</b> are machines {{that are used}} on the production lines in bulk food processing and other industries. They separate items by their colours, detecting the colours of things that pass before them, and using mechanical or pneumatic ejection devices to divert items whose colours do not fall within the acceptable range.|$|R
50|$|As {{the names}} imply, freefall <b>sorters</b> inspect product in-air during the freefall, while chute-fed <b>sorters</b> {{stabilize}} product on a chute prior to in-air inspection. The major advantages of freefall and chute-fed <b>sorters,</b> compared to belt <b>sorters,</b> are {{a lower price}} point, smaller footprint {{and the absence of}} moving parts, which contributes to low maintenance. These <b>sorters</b> are often most suitable for nuts and berries as well as a frozen and dried fruits, vegetables, potato strips and seafood, in addition to waste recycling applications that require mid-volume throughputs.|$|R

25|$|The {{tabulating machine}} is an {{electrical}} device designed {{to assist in}} summarizing information and, later, accounting. The results of a tabulation are electrically coupled with a <b>sorter</b> while displayed on clock-like dials. The concept of automated data processing had been born. In 1890, Herman Hollerith invented the mechanical tabulating machine, a design used during the 1890 Census which stored and processed demographic and statistical information on punched cards.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the food}} {{processing}} industry, hyperspectral imaging, combined with intelligent software, enables digital <b>sorters</b> (also called optical <b>sorters)</b> {{to identify and}} remove defects and foreign material (FM) that are invisible to traditional camera and laser <b>sorters.</b> [...] By improving the accuracy of defect and FM removal, the food processor’s objective is to enhance product quality and increase yields.|$|R
40|$|Popular sorting {{algorithms}} do {{not translate}} well into hardware implementations. Instead, hardware-based solutions like sorting networks, systolic <b>sorters,</b> and linear <b>sorters</b> exploit parallelism to increase sorting efficiency. Linear <b>sorters,</b> built from identical nodes with simple control, have less area and latency than sorting networks, {{but they are}} limited in their throughput. We present a system composed of multiple linear <b>sorters</b> acting in parallel to increase overall throughput. Interleaving is used to increase bandwidth and allow sorting of multiple values per clock cycle, {{and the amount of}} interleaving and depth of the linear <b>sorters</b> can be adapted to suit specific applications. Contention for available linear <b>sorters</b> in the system is solved through the use of buffers that accumulate conflicting requests, dispatching them in bulk to reduce latency penalties. Implementation of this system into a field programmable gate array (FPGA) results in a speedup of 68 compared to a MicroBlaze processor running quicksort...|$|R

The KTS is closely associated with the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI); however, there are significant practical and theoretical differences between the two personality questionnaires and their associated different descriptions.|$|E
25|$|During {{an event}} on March 21, 2016, Apple {{provided}} a status update on its environmental initiative to be 100% renewable {{in all of}} its worldwide operations. Lisa P. Jackson, Apple's vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives who reports directly to CEO, Tim Cook, announced that as of March 2016, 93% of Apple's worldwide operations are powered with renewable energy. Also featured was the company's efforts to use sustainable paper in their product packaging; 99% of all paper used by Apple in the product packaging comes from post-consumer recycled paper or sustainably managed forests, as the company continues its move to all paper packaging for all of its products. Apple working in partnership with Conservation Fund, have preserved 36,000 acres of working forests in Maine and North Carolina. Another partnership announced is with the World Wildlife Fund to preserve up to 1,000,000 acres of forests in China. Featured was the company's installation of a 40 MW solar power plant in the Sichuan province of China that was tailor made to coexist with the indigenous yaks that eat hay produced on the land, by raising the panels to be several feet off of the ground so the yaks and their feed would be unharmed grazing beneath the array. This installation alone compensates for more than all of the energy used in Apple's Stores and Offices in the whole of China, negating the company's energy carbon footprint in the country. In Singapore, Apple has worked with the Singaporean government to cover the rooftops of 800 buildings in the city-state with solar panels allowing Apple's Singapore operations to be run on 100% renewable energy. Liam was introduced to the world, an advanced robotic disassembler and <b>sorter</b> designed by Apple Engineers in California specifically for recycling outdated or broken iPhones.

40|$|The general time-space-time {{switching}} {{problem in}} telecommunications requires {{the use of}} multichannel time slot interchangers. In this paper, we propose two multichannel time slot <b>sorters</b> which sort N time division multiplexed (TDM) optical inputs, arranged as N frames with N time slots per frame using O(N log N) optical switch elements. The TDM optical inputs are sorted in place without expanding the space-time fabric into a space division switch. The hardware components used are 2 Θ 2 optical switches (LiNbO 3 directional couplers) and optical delay lines connected in a feed forward fashion. Two space-time variants of the spatial odd-even merge algorithm are used to design the <b>sorters.</b> By maintaining the number of shift-exchange operations invariant at each stage, the proposed <b>sorters</b> use fewer switches than previously proposed <b>sorters</b> using switches with feedback line delays, (the K-switch in [21]), and other <b>sorters</b> using switches with feed forward line delays [22, 23]...|$|R

50|$|An {{activity}} in many unit record shops was sorting card decks into the order {{necessary for the}} next processing step. <b>Sorters,</b> like the IBM 80 series Card <b>Sorters,</b> sorted input cards into one of 13 pockets depending on the holes punched in a selected column and the <b>sorter's</b> settings. The 13th pocket was for blanks and rejects. Sorting an input card deck into ascending sequence on a multiple column field, such as an employee number, was done by a radix sort, bucket sort, {{or a combination of}} the two methods.|$|R

[...] Failing to recover lucidity, he was committed to a psychiatric hospital for over a year. After he was discharged, he eventually returned to cricket, and continued to play for his state, Victoria, and club, South Melbourne, into his forties. After his retirement, Trott served as a selector for Victoria for a number of years. Outside of cricket, he worked as a postman and mail <b>sorter.</b> He died of cancer in 1917, aged 51.|$|E
500|$|Trott {{spent his}} entire working life in the Post Office, {{employed}} as a postman and mail <b>sorter.</b> [...] He married Violet Hodson in Fitzroy on 17 February 1890 and the couple had one son. In 1911, Trott became a selector for the Victorian team when Hugh Trumble resigned to take the secretaryship of the Melbourne Cricket Club. [...] Trott's high standing in the cricket community saw the other candidate for the position withdraw rather than oppose him. [...] In 1912, Trott took {{the side of the}} [...] "Big Six", the Australian cricketers opposed to the newly formed Australian Board of Control for International Cricket's attempt to wrest control of touring Australian sides from the players. [...] At an [...] "indignation meeting" [...] at the Athenaeum Hall on Collins Street in Melbourne, the Argus reported Trott as saying that [...] "to say he was disgusted with the Board of Control was to put it mildly" [...] and that [...] "e would like to shake hands with the six men who had stood out against the Board".|$|E
