Tantalum capacitors can replace aluminum electrolytic capacitors in situations where the external environment or dense component packing results in a sustained hot internal environment and where high reliability is important.

This performance criterion is a generalisation of the well known H 1 norm criterion used in the frequency domain for analysis and synthesis of linear time invariant control systems. A number of different time varying system frameworks are considered, for which there are no frequency domain counterparts. One such class is that of aperiodic sampleddata systems, that is continuous time systems connected to a discrete controller via <b>sampling</b> <b>and</b> <b>hold</b> devices. Multiple generalized <b>sampling</b> <b>and</b> <b>hold</b> devices, which may be aperiodic and asynchronous, are permitted within the framework considered in this thesis.

A new approach, which was recently introduced to sampled-data state-feedback stabilization, is developed to the H ∞ control. The system is modelled as a continuous-time one, where the control input and the measurement output have piecewise-continuous delays. Sufficient linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) conditions for H ∞ control of such systems are derived via Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals and descriptor approach to time-delay systems.

25|$|The voltage at the {{terminals}} {{generated by}} the dielectric absorption may possibly cause problems in the function of an electronic circuit. For sensitive analog circuits such as <b>sample</b> <b>and</b> <b>hold</b> circuits, integrators, charge amplifiers or high-quality audio circuits, Class-1 ceramic or polypropylene capacitors instead of Class-2 ceramic capacitors, polyester film capacitors or electrolytic capacitors are used. For most electronic circuits, particularly filtering applications, the small dielectric absorption voltage has no influence on the proper electrical function of the circuit. For aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte which are not built into a circuit, the dielectric absorption voltage generated can be a personnel safety risk. The voltage can be quite substantial, for example 50V for 400V electrolytic capacitors, and can cause damages to semiconductor devices, or cause sparks during installation in the circuit. Larger aluminum electrolytic capacitors and high-voltage power capacitors are transported and delivered short-circuited to dissipate this unwanted and possibly dangerous energy.|$|E
2500|$|Capacitors {{made with}} {{any type of}} {{dielectric}} material show some level of [...] "dielectric absorption" [...] or [...] "soakage". On discharging a capacitor and disconnecting it, after a short time it may develop a voltage due to hysteresis in the dielectric. This effect is objectionable in applications such as precision <b>sample</b> <b>and</b> <b>hold</b> circuits or timing circuits. The level of absorption depends on many factors, from design considerations to charging time, since the absorption is a time-dependent process. However, the primary factor {{is the type of}} dielectric material. Capacitors such as tantalum electrolytic or polysulfone film exhibit relatively high absorption, while polystyrene or Teflon allow very small levels of absorption. In some capacitors where dangerous voltages and energies exist, such as in flashtubes, television sets, and defibrillators, the dielectric absorption can recharge the capacitor to hazardous voltages after it has been shorted or discharged. Any capacitor containing over 10 joules of energy is generally considered hazardous, while 50 joules or higher is potentially lethal. A capacitor may regain anywhere from 0.01 to 20% of its original charge {{over a period of several}} minutes, allowing a seemingly safe capacitor to become surprisingly dangerous.|$|E
