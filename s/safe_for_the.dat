5|$|Bryan's {{nomination}} caused defections and {{divisions in}} the Republican party; many farmers in the Midwest, even in McKinley's Ohio, found the inflation it was expected free silver would cause to be attractive, as {{it would make it}} easier to repay debts. Polls in battleground midwestern states, and word from activists there, showed that Bryan had made deep inroads into Republican support. One survey in August showed that of the midwestern states, only Wisconsin was <b>safe</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Republicans.|$|E

5|$|Haldane's {{hypothesis}} {{was that a}} diver could ascend immediately to a depth where the supersaturation reaches but does not exceed the critical supersaturation level, at which depth the pressure gradient for off-gassing is maximized and the decompression is most efficient. The diver would remain at this depth until saturation had reduced sufficiently for him to ascend another 10 feet, to the new depth of critical supersaturation, where the process would be repeated until it was <b>safe</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> diver to reach the surface. Haldane assumed a constant critical ratio of dissolved nitrogen pressure to ambient pressure which was invariant with depth.|$|E
5|$|Photographing {{an eclipse}} is {{possible}} with fairly common camera equipment. In {{order for the}} disk of the Sun/Moon to be easily visible, a fairly high magnification long focus lens is needed (at least 200mm for a 35mm camera), and for the disk to fill most of the frame, a longer lens is needed (over 500mm). As with viewing the Sun directly, looking at it through the optical viewfinder of a camera can produce damage to the retina, so care is recommended. Solar filters are required for digital photography even if an optical viewfinder is not used. Using a camera's live view feature or an electronic viewfinder is <b>safe</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> human eye, but the Sun's rays could potentially irreparably damage digital image sensors unless the lens is covered by a properly designed solar filter.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} later, Leake {{received}} {{the news that}} a convoy of 20 transport ships carrying supplies and reinforcements {{was on its way}} from Lisbon, escorted by four men-of-war. Adverse winds and currents meant that he was unable to sail to assist it against a French naval force that had left Cadiz, and he was forced to wait to see if the convoy would reach its destination. On 18 December, nine of the transports reached the bay, accompanied by two men-of-war, with another seven arriving on 20 December. Four were missing, having been intercepted by the French; three of them had been sunk or captured while the last one eventually made it to Gibraltar at the end of December. They brought with them 2,200 men from the Grenadier Guards, Donegal's Foot and Barrymore's Foot, plus some Dutch troops, guns and supplies of powder, tools and food. Further reinforcements arrived between 16–18 January. With Gibraltar <b>safe</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> moment, Leake left for Lisbon on 3 January with sick and wounded members of the garrison aboard his ships.|$|E

25|$|While the {{building}} was <b>safe</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> time being, its exterior, particularly the columns, were in an advanced state of decay. The federal Department of Housing and Urban Development which administered the city's urban-renewal grants, ordered in 1974 that it be either razed or sold. The city bought it for $7,000.|$|E

25|$|In {{saturation}} diving all tissues {{are considered}} saturated and decompression which is <b>safe</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> slowest tissues will theoretically be safe for all faster tissues {{in a parallel}} model. Direct ascent from air saturation at approximately 7msw produces venous gas bubbles but not symptomatic DCS. Deeper saturation exposures require decompression to saturation schedules.|$|E
25|$|Davis' {{leadership}} and compromise-building skills {{have also been}} questioned. Many of the challenges that California faced during his years required a strong force of personality to forge compromise but Davis lacked such skill. He was also hurt by redistricting in 2000 that made most districts <b>safe</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> incumbent party, limiting some legislators' need and willingness to compromise.|$|E
25|$|Low to moderate-quality {{evidence}} suggests that spinal manipulation is an effective treatment for acute sciatica. For chronic sciatica, the evidence is poor. Spinal manipulation has been found generally <b>safe</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> treatment of disc-related pain; however, case reports have found an association with cauda equina syndrome, and it is contraindicated when there are progressive neurological deficits.|$|E

25|$|Common {{side effects}} include bone marrow suppression, loss of appetite, diarrhea, vomiting, and psychosis. {{anaphylaxis}} and other allergic reactions occasionally occur. It is unclear if use in pregnancy is <b>safe</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> baby. Flucytosine {{is in the}} fluorinated pyrimidine analogue family of medications. It works by being converted into fluorouracil inside the fungus which then blocks its ability to make protein.|$|E
25|$|Side {{effects are}} {{generally}} minimal. Common side effects include loss of appetite, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and feeling tired. Serious side effects include suicidal thoughts, low blood cell levels, and lupus erythematosus.

25|$|Common {{side effects}} include headaches, fever, and nausea. Serious side effects include liver problems, muscle damage, {{and high blood}} lactate levels. It is {{commonly}} used in pregnancy {{and appears to be}} <b>safe</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> baby. ZDV is of the nucleoside analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) class.

25|$|Common {{side effects}} include {{headache}} and low blood pressure. The low blood pressure can be severe. It is unclear if use in pregnancy is <b>safe</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> baby. It {{should not be}} used together with medications within the sildenafil (PDE5 inhibitor) family due to the risk of low blood pressure. Nitroglycerin is in the nitrate family of medications. While it is not entirely clear how it works, it is believed to function by dilating blood vessels.|$|E
25|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) outlawed {{the use of}} {{fluorescein}} {{for this}} purpose, since it was shown to be harmful to the river.
