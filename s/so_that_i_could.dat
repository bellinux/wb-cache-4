25|$|The vibrato {{sound is}} incredible, {{and it took}} a long time. I put down the rhythm track on an Epiphone Casino through a Fender Twin Reverb without vibrato. Then we played the track back through four old Twins, one on each side. We had to keep all the amps {{vibrating}} in time to the track and each other, so we had to keep stopping and starting the track, recording it in 10-second bursts... I wish I could remember exactly how we did the slide part – not writing it down is one of the banes of my life! We did it in three passes through a harmonizer, set to some weird interval, like a sixth. There was a different harmonization for each pass. For the line in harmonics, I retuned the guitar <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> play it all at the 12th fret with natural harmonics. It's doubled several times.|$|E

On 10 March 1923 he wrote a letter to his patron, Harriet Weaver: [...] "Yesterday I wrote two pages—the first I have since the final Yes of Ulysses. Having found a pen, with some difficulty I copied them out in a large handwriting on a double sheet of foolscap <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> read them." [...] This is the earliest reference to what would become Finnegans Wake.|$|E

500|$|Ultimately, Nile Rodgers {{was chosen}} by Madonna as the {{producer}} of the album, {{with the approval of}} the Warner Brothers executives. Madonna chose Rodgers mostly because of his work {{as a member of the}} seventies band Chic, and his most recent production work with David Bowie on his 1983 album Let's Dance. She commented, [...] "When I was making the record, I was just so thrilled and happy to be working with Nile Rodgers. I idolized Nile because of the whole Chic thing. I couldn't believe that the record company gave me the money <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> work with him." ...|$|E

500|$|With the {{assistance}} of scriptwriter Tony Williamson, Anderson and his wife, Sylvia, had drafted a 194-page treatment long before the initial meeting with Kanter. The Andersons had originally intended to film the script as a one-hour drama for ATV; Sylvia explained that since the concept [...] "was too good for a television play, I suggested to Gerry {{that we try to}} develop it as a movie." [...] Responding to claims that Doppelgänger had [...] "dark" [...] scripting, Gerry stated that he wanted the film to have an interesting and entertaining premise. He also discussed the significance of the title, which was suggested to him by Century 21 co-director John Read: Doppelgänger being [...] "a German word which means 'a copy of oneself', and the legend goes that if you meet your doppelganger, it is the point of your death. Following that legend, clearly, I had to steer the film <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> end it illustrating the meaning of that word." ...|$|E
500|$|Elisabeth's {{body was}} placed in a silver casket, a gift from Nicholas II, for the journey back to Darmstadt.

A cousin, Kaiser Wilhelm II, expressed shock at the child's death in a letter to Tsar Nicholas II on 7 November 1903. [...] "How joyous and merry she was that day at Wolfsgarten, when I was there, so full of life and fun and health ... What a terrible heartrending blow for poor Ernie, who doted and adored that little enchantress!" [...] Elisabeth was buried in the Rosenhöhe {{with other members of the}} Hessian grand ducal family. A marble angel was later installed to watch over her grave. In a final gesture to Elisabeth and Ernst, Victoria Melita placed her badge of the Order of Hesse, granted to her upon her marriage, into Elisabeth's coffin. Ernst was still devastated by the memory of his daughter's death thirty years later. [...] "My little Elisabeth," [...] he wrote in his memoirs, [...] "was the sunshine of my life." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{they wanted}} to {{reproduce}} an older sound, Saadiq and Brunghardt also wanted to capture more of the bass and drum parts to add a louder, modern element to the mix. They applied a more basic approach to miking the instruments and utilizing the outboard gear, using a Neumann U 47 for guitars, alternating overhead microphones for Saadiq's drum kit, a combination of dynamic and condenser mics for the kit's bass drum, and Ampex tape machines for extra warmth to the kit. Brungardt used various standard mics for the snare drum to achieve a more solid cracking sound, rather than capturing the drum's overall tone. Their miking of the guitars' amps was adapted from The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions, and as Brungardt recounted, [...] "It really gave us warmth and character. It allowed the amp to breathe and we got the tones of the amp along with the room. For me, that really opened things up <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> play with the live room, using different reverbs to get a sound." [...] For Saadiq's bass, they used a DI unit to connect a microphone preamplifier, increased the gain on a plug-in for less compression, and adjusted the low-end tones with an equalizer plug-in.|$|E

[...] Jay-Z expands on the album's overarching theme of self-doubt: [...] "And since no good deed go unpunished / I'm not as cool with niggaz as I once was / I once was cool as the Fonz was / But these bright lights turned me to a monster." [...] "Miss Me" [...] has Lil Wayne rapping jokes, including a crude punch line about sucking [...] "the brown" [...] off his penis and subsequently groaning, [...] "Ewwww, that's nasty." [...] "Cece's Interlude" [...] has a Prince-like LinnDrum and transparent lyrics addressing a girl: [...] "I wish I / Wasn't famous / I wish I / Was still in school / <b>So</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have you in my dorm room / I would put it on you crazy." [...] The pop song [...] "Find Your Love" [...] was produced by Kanye West and bears similarity to his 2008 song [...] "Heartless".|$|E
500|$|Between March and May 1970 Morrison {{began work}} on the album at the A {{recording}} studios in New York City. He intended to create a full a capella record, and {{with this in mind}} assembled a vocal group he called the Street Choir, consisting of his friends Dahaud Shaar, Larry Goldsmith, Andrew Robinson and then wife, Janet [...] "Planet" [...] Rigsbee, who all lived near Woodstock. He had wanted the choir to feature only four vocalists, but was persuaded to allow two additional members to join: the wives of Keith Johnson and Jack Schroer (Martha Velez and Ellen Schroer). However, Morrison was later persuaded to abandon the use of a cappella: [...] "I had a group of people in mind for the Street Choir... I asked them if they wanted to sing... then the old ladies got involved and it ruined the whole thing." [...] He was unhappy with the tracks recorded with the choir, as he wanted to use the group for a different effect: [...] "I wanted these certain guys to form an a cappella group <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> cut a lot of songs with just maybe one guitar. But it didn't turn out." [...] During this session Morrison recorded the same tracks used for the demo session in Woodstock, as well as [...] "Gypsy Queen" [...] and an additional instrumental, six of which were used on Street Choir. Elliot Scheiner was used as the engineer for this session, after he helped to produce Moondance. However, according to biographer Clinton Heylin, Scheiner and Morrison had a disagreement, so he was not used {{for the rest of the}} album.|$|E

He said that the moments before the ditching were [...] "the worst sickening, pit-of-your-stomach, falling-through-the-floor feeling" [...] that he had ever experienced.
