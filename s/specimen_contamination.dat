40|$|Contamination of {{clinical}} specimens by Mycobacterium gordonae is a signi®cant endemic problem in many laboratories. To investigate this problem, 84 cases at 1 hospital were retro-spectively identi®ed during 20 months. The overall rate of <b>specimen</b> <b>contamination</b> was 2. 4 %, and 72 of the contaminated specimens were respiratory. A case-control comparison {{showed that the}} risk of respiratory <b>specimen</b> <b>contamination</b> was signi®cantly increased if the specimen was expectorated (odds ratio [OR], 3. 62; 95 % con®dence interval [CI], 1. 36 ± 9. 50) or if the patient consumed ¯uids within 2 days before specimen collection (OR, 8. 92; 95 % CI, 1. 40 ± 71. 20). Cultures of tap water, ice, and iced drinking water all yielded M. gordonae at 1022 ± 100 cfu/mL. A culture survey of consenting patients showed contamination of 8 (24 %) of 34 sputum specimens collected immediately after a tap water mouth rinse. These ®ndings demonstrate that endemic <b>specimen</b> <b>contamination</b> arises from mycobacteria in hospital tap water and provide a foundation for control efforts. Mycobacterium gordonae, like other nontuberculous myco-bacteria, is found primarily in natural waters and tap water systems [1, 2]. It rarely causes human infection or colonizatio...|$|E

When this test was performed on urine specimens from 282 children with significant bacteriuria, false-negative and false-positive results were observed in 20 % (19 / 94) and 52 % (19 / 188) of the <b>specimens.</b> <b>Contamination</b> of the <b>specimen</b> during collection and the presence of Fc receptors (receptors for the crystallizable fragment of the immunoglobulin molecule) on the surface of some strains of Staphylococcus aureus yielded false-positive results, and stools and vaginal secretions were shown to be potential sources of antibody-coated bacteria. It is suggested that for children this test be run on urine collected by bladder puncture.

40|$|We {{determined}} {{the validity of}} using external devices for urine specimen collection from 24 elderly incontinent men residing {{in a nursing home}} by collecting three sequential specimens, two with external devices and then one by catheterization. The positive predictive value of organisms isolated in quantitative counts of {{greater than or equal to}} 10 (5) CFU/ml in external devices for bladder bacteriuria was 86 % for either sterile or clean collecting devices and 93 % for the same organism in two consecutive specimens. The negative predictive value for organisms present in quantitative counts of less than 10 (5) CFU/ml was 90 % for both sterile and clean devices and 86 % when the organism was present in both <b>specimens.</b> <b>Contamination</b> in external collection devices was not influenced by whether the device was clean or sterile, circumcision of the resident, or duration of time between device application and specimen collection.

40|$|A {{study to}} {{determine}} the efficacy of 3 % Ogawa Vs Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) culture media for culture isolation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) from smear positive and smear negative sputum specimen from patients suspected of pulmonary tuberculosis was conducted at the Medical Microbiology Research Laboratory, Philippine General Hospital, University of the Philippines Manila Sputum specimen received from the medical wards and outpatient department of the Philippine General Hospital were screened for {{the presence or absence}} of acid fast bacilli. The specimen was then processed by the Ogawa method and the concentrated method by Petroffs. An aliquot of the sediment was inoculated onto each Ogawa and LJ culture tubes. These culture tubes were incubated at 37 oC and observed for growth until eight weeks. Two hundred seventy nine (279) smear negative and 235 smear positive sputum specimen were processed and cultured. In smear negative specimen, growth of M. tb was 5. 1 % in 3 % Ogawa medium and 5. 8 % on LJ media (p = 0. 70). Among the smear positive specimens, 96. 9 % grew on Ogawa and 93. 6 % on LJ.

CONCLUSION: In the clinical setting, this method provides a useful alternative to conventional DNA isolation. It is easily implemented and inexpensive, and provides sufficient, stable DNA for multiple assays.

40|$|In South Africa {{where the}} {{prevalence}} of HIV infection is very high, 4 th generation HIV antibody/p 24 antigen combo immunoassays are the tests of choice for laboratory based screening. Testing is usually performed in clinical pathology laboratories on automated analysers. To investigate the cause of false positive results on 4 th generation HIV testing platforms in public sector laboratories, the performance of two automated platforms was compared in a clinical pathology setting, firstly on routine diagnostic specimens and secondly on known sero-negative samples. Firstly, 1181 routine diagnostic specimens were sequentially tested on Siemens and Roche automated 4 th generation platforms. HIV viral load, western blot and follow up testing {{were used to determine}} the true status of inconclusive specimens. Subsequently, known HIV seronegative samples from a single donor were repeatedly tested on both platforms and an analyser was tested for surface contamination with HIV positive serum to identify how suspected <b>specimen</b> <b>contamination</b> could be occurring. Serial testing of diagnostic specimens yielded 163 weakly positive or discordant results. Only 3 of 163 were conclusively shown to indicate true HIV infection. <b>Specimen</b> <b>contamination</b> with HIV antibody was suspected, based on the following evidence: the proportion of positive specimens increased on repeated passage through the analysers; viral loads were low or undetectable and western blots negative or indeterminate on problem specimens; screen negative, 2 nd test positive specimens tested positive when reanalysed on the screening assay; follow up specimens (where available) were negative. Similarly, an increasing number of known negative specimens became (repeatedly) sero-positive on serial passage through one of the analysers. Internal and external analyser surfaces were contaminated with HIV serum, evidence that sample splashes occur during testing. Due to the extreme sensitivity of these assays, contamination with minute amounts of HIV antibody can cause a negative sample to test positive. Better contamination control measures are needed on analysers used in clinical pathology environments, especially in regions where HIV sero-prevalence is high...|$|E

While much attention has been directed toward minimizing false-positive reactions resulting from <b>specimen</b> <b>contamination</b> or amplicor carryover, relatively {{little attention has been}} given to the causes of false-negative PCRs. This report describes a PCR inhibitor in normal aqueous and vitreous fluids that can produce false-negative PCR results. As little as 0. 5 microliter of vitreous fluid and 20 microliters of aqueous fluid can completely inhibit DNA amplification in a 100 -microliters PCR mixture. This inhibition was not primer specific, nor was it due to chelation of Mg 2 + ions or DNase activity in the ocular fluid. The inhibitor was completely resistant to boiling for 15 min. However, the inhibitory effects were completely removed by a single chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (24 : 1) extraction. The extent of PCR inhibition depended upon the type of thermostable DNA polymerase used in the reaction. Taq DNA polymerase was very sensitive to the inhibitor, while thermostable DNA polymerases from Thermus thermophilus HB- 8 (Tth) and Thermus flavus (Tfl) were completely resistant. Thus, the inhibitory effects of intraocular fluids on PCRs can be removed by diluting the specimen, by chloroform extraction, or by using Tth or Tfl DNA polymerases...|$|E

We investigated the frequency and clinical {{significance of}} NTM isolated from patients receiving anti-TB treatment. MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients with culture-confirmed pulmonary TB, and identified patients with respiratory cultures positive for NTM during therapy for pulmonary TB. ResultsFrom January 2003 to December 2005, 958 patients were diagnosed with culture-confirmed pulmonary TB. NTM were isolated from 113 specimens in 68 (7. 1 %) patients during anti-TB treatment. The most frequently isolated NTM species were Mycobacterium abscessus (n= 35, 31 %), Mycobacterium fortuitum (n= 17, 15 %), Mycobacterium avium complex (n= 9, 8 %), and Mycobacterium gordonae (n= 9, 8 %). Forty-eight (71 %) patients had only one positive culture, while 20 (29 %) had two or more positive cultures for NTM. Only two (3 %) patients who had two or more positive culture after anti-TB treatment showed the same NTM species, which were M. abscessus. ConclusionThe isolation of NTM in patients with pulmonary TB is not uncommon during anti-TB treatment.

Methods: This was a cross-sectional descriptive study on 81 Emergency Department nurses in Dr. Hasan Sadikin General Hospital, Indonesia. Subjects were asked to complete a questionnaire in order to measure their knowledge of blood culture sampling procedure in accordance with the hospital’s standard operating procedure. Results: Among 81 subjects enrolled, 51 managed to adequately describe the prerequisites in proper blood culture sampling procedure and their purpose as dictated by Dr. Hasan Sadikin General Hospital’s standard operating procedure. Conclusions: Up to 67...|$|R
40|$|Transmission Electron Microscopy: Physics of Image Formation {{presents}} {{the theory of}} image and contrast formation, and the analytical modes in transmission electron microscopy. The principles of particle and wave optics of electrons are described. Electron-specimen interactions are discussed for evaluating the theory of scattering and phase contrast. Also discussed are the kinematical and dynamical theories of electron diffraction and their applications for crystal-structure analysis and imaging of lattices and their defects. X-ray microanalysis and electron energy-loss spectroscopy are treated as analytical methods. <b>Specimen</b> damage and <b>contamination</b> by electron irradiation limits the resolution for biological and some inorganic specimens. This fifth edition includes discussion of recent progress, especially {{in the area of}} aberration correction and energy filtering; moreover, the topics introduced in the fourth edition have been updated. Transmission Electron Microscopy: Physics of Image Formation is written for scientists and application engineers in fields such as physics, chemistry, mineralogy, materials science and biology. Researchers, students, and other users of a transmission electron microscope can also benefit from this text...|$|R
