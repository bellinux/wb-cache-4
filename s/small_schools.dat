5|$|Since its founding, Cooper {{has served}} as the center of attractions for Delta County. The city became host to several <b>small</b> <b>schools</b> and churches. In 1955, the {{construction}} of Cooper Lake was authorized. In 1986, major work on the lake began, and the lake was finished in 1991. The lake is now the most popular tourist attraction in the area. Boating, swimming, and fishing are available at Cooper Lake. The main fish stocked in the lake are catfish, largemouth bass, and crappie. Along the north shore of the lake is the Doctor's Creek Unit of Cooper Lake State Park. The park contains several picnic areas, campgrounds and a large swimming area on Cooper Lake. The park also contains several hiking and equestrian trails. On {{the eastern edge of the}} lake near the Cooper Lake Dam is the Wildlife Observation Deck, a large birdwatching platform. Along the west and northwest shores of the lake is the Cooper Wildlife Management Area. The park was constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and protects four unique habitat types. These are wetland, Blackland Prairie, Upland Post Oak, and Bottomland Hardwood. The park contains several hiking trails, as well as birdwatching stations and wildlife viewing areas. The park allows fishing and hunting to visitors if they have a proper license.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the events}} finally {{stabilized}} during the 2000–01 season, the USAD administration changed dramatically that {{year when the}} program's executive director, James Alvino, resigned. Alvino had written a religious article that had been included in that year's Super Quiz Resource Guide. His critics and the USAD Board regarded the inclusion as a conflict of interest, as the material was a persuasive essay that heavily pushed Alvino's point of view. The season was also significant {{in that it was}} the first year that states were allowed to send both their large and small school champions to the national competition. (<b>Small</b> <b>schools</b> are currently classified as those schools with fewer than 650 students.) However, this practice was short-lived and was discontinued after the 2002 season. Instead, a small school e-Nationals was introduced during the 2005–06 school year. The medium school e-Nationals was established two years later for those schools with between 650 and 1,300 students. In 2010, California Academic Decathlon announced that a large school e-Nationals would be held for the second-highest performing school in each state.|$|E
25|$|Klonsky {{became one}} of the leaders of the modern <b>small</b> <b>schools</b> {{movement}} which has done much to transform the face of secondary school education in the United State. His academic work focused on small school size as a solution to the problems of inner city schools; his early research on issues of school size and its impact on student achievement, school violence, and dropout rates, helped pave the way towards the development of thousands of new small and charter schools across the country. By 1996, he was the director of the <b>Small</b> <b>Schools</b> Workshop at the University of Illinois, Chicago, and in 1999, he was named by president Bill Clinton to the Academic Advisory Council of the National Campaign Against Youth Violence, where he advocated <b>small</b> <b>schools</b> as a mechanism for violence reduction. Klonsky is now a retired professor of education after teaching at several universities, including UIC and the Fischler School of Education at Nova Southeastern University.|$|E

25|$|The {{blue runner}} {{normally}} moves either in <b>small</b> <b>schools</b> or as solitary individuals, although large aggregations {{of up to}} 10,000 individuals are known in unusual circumstances.

25|$|Studies {{around these}} {{platforms}} has found blue runner feed with equal intensity during both day and night, with larger prey such as fish taken preferentially at night, with smaller crustaceans {{taken during the}} day. Blue runner are {{one of a number}} of carangids known to forage in <b>small</b> <b>schools</b> alongside actively feeding Spinner Dolphins (Stenella longirostris), taking advantage of any scraps of food left by the feeding mammals, or any organisms displaced while they forage.

25|$|Although {{there is}} not any {{official}} definition {{of what constitutes a}} Cinderella team, {{there does seem to be}} a consensus that such teams represent <b>small</b> <b>schools,</b> are usually low-seeded in the tournament, and achieves at least one unexpected win in the tournament. A recent example of this is Florida Gulf Coast University, a relatively new school that held its first classes in 1997 and became Division I postseason eligible in 2011. They made their first ever appearance in the 2013 tournament, winning two games to become the first ever #15 seed to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. The term was popularized as a result of City College of New York's successful run in the 1950 tournament.|$|E
25|$|The African threadfish (Alectis alexandrina) (also {{known as}} the Alexandria pompano) is a species of large marine fish in the jack family, Carangidae. The species is {{distributed}} {{along the coast of}} tropical Africa in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, extending to the Mediterranean Sea. Adults live predominantly in shallow waters shallower than 70 m deep, often forming <b>small</b> <b>schools.</b> The African threadfish is similar in appearance to the closely related and co-occurring African pompano, with the slightly concave shape of the species head profile the most definitive feature of the species. Like other members of the genus Alectis, the juveniles of the species have long trailing dorsal and anal fins. The African threadfish is of minor commercial importance, and is also considered to be a game fish.|$|E

25|$|The bludger {{moves in}} <b>small</b> <b>schools</b> as a juvenile, {{becoming}} more solitary with age. The species has a rather soft mouth and weak jaws, limiting {{the types of}} prey available to it, with studies showing prawns, small crabs, mantis shrimps and small fish are its main prey. Research on the North West Shelf of Australia indicates there is diet partitioning between the bludger and the yellowspotted trevally, with the bludger taking mostly crustaceans while the yellowspotted trevally consumes mostly fish and cephalopods. The species itself {{is known to be}} prey for sharks including the blacktip shark, Carcharhinus tilstoni. Reproduction and growth in the species is poorly studied, with preliminary observations in South Africa indicating the fish may move from this region to more tropical waters of Mozambique to spawn.|$|E
25|$|Charter {{schools are}} state funded schools which operate {{outside of the}} normal state system. They began in 2014 with 5 <b>small</b> <b>schools.</b> Charter schools {{do not have to}} operate with any {{registered}} or trained teachers. Teachers do not have to have current practicing certificates. They do not have to have a principal. They are allowed to benefit from profit making. They do not have to follow the national curriculum. They receive approximately 3 times the level of funding per student than normal state schools. If the charter school roll drops during the year, the school keeps the extra funding, unlike normal state schools, where funding is matched to students actually attending. If a charter school fails the management/owners are allowed to keep the land and buildings and other capital assets. Charter schools have less compliance with regulations than State schools although teachers must undergo police vetting.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in fall 2002, smaller {{high schools}} were {{established}} within the JFK campus, co-existing with Kennedy High School. Marble Hill High School was opened in September 2002. The Bronx School of Law and Finance and Bronx Theatre High School were opened in September 2003. The Bronx School for Law & Finance was opened in September 2004. The enrollment of John F. Kennedy High School began shrinking in 2004 as the <b>small</b> <b>schools</b> grew, with a target cap of 2,500 students. Results from the 2010-11 NYC School Survey were abysmally low. Over half {{of students who}} took the survey reported that their peers did not respect teachers or other students; over 70 percent of teachers reported the same; meanwhile the school became increasingly plagued by crime and poor academic results. In late-2010, the Department of Education decided to shut John F. Kennedy by eliminating one grade per year until it graduated its last class in 2014. Crucial to the decision to close the school was the DOE’s assertion that the school was under performing, earning an overall D on its 2009-10 progress report, with a F grade for student performance. According to the DOE, four-year graduation rate at Kennedy High School was 46%, {{as opposed to a}} 63% average for the city. JFK High School graduated its final class in June 2014.|$|E
