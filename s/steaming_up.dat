25|$|Lieutenant Commander Cookson {{accepted}} the order. <b>Steaming</b> <b>up</b> river {{with his gun}} boats, the RN/RIM units passed through the Ottoman lines under heavy fire. However, just short of Kut, they found the river blocked {{by a combination of}} sunken river boats and steel cables. Stopped by the obstruction, the Anglo-Indian riverboats attempted to cut their way through. Cookson himself, with most of his crew wounded, attempted to cut through the cables to allow the rest of his boats to pass through. However, he was shot and killed in the attempt. Cookson was awarded the Victoria Cross for his attempt.|$|E
25|$|Coulthard's helmet {{design is}} blue and {{consists}} of a white saltire on the top which resembles the flag of Scotland and the four tips are trepassed {{from the top of}} the chin area. Coulthard borrowed a helmet belonging to Michael Schumacher for the 1996 Monaco Grand Prix as his regular helmet was suffering from <b>steaming</b> <b>up</b> during the weekend. Upon Schumacher's first retirement in 2006, he suggested to Coulthard that he would swap one of his own helmets for one of Coulthard's, which was agreed by Coulthard. For the 2007 Japanese Grand Prix, he changed his design to grey with a stylised saltire on the sides of his helmet, as an homage to the late World Rally Champion Colin McRae.|$|E
25|$|At 13:30 on 28 May, the Italians {{believed}} that three cruisers and six destroyers of the Royal Navy were <b>steaming</b> <b>up</b> towards the northern coast of Crete {{in support of}} Allied troops, but the Royal Navy was fully occupied evacuating the Crete garrison. The Italians assumed that the Royal Navy force would be off Sitia, the planned landing site, by 17:00 and the commander decided that the slowest ship of the convoy would be taken in tow by Lince to increase speed and Crispi was detached to shell the lighthouse at Cape Sideros. The 3,000 men of the division and their equipment were on shore by 17:20 and advanced west unopposed, rendezvousing with the Germans at Ierapetra. The Italian troops later moved their headquarters from Sitia to Agios Nikolaos.|$|E

She remained based out of Foochow until 1884 {{as part of the}} Fujian Fleet under Zhang Peilun, where she was present for the Battle of Fuzhou on 23 August, the opening engagement of the Sino-French War. At the battle, the Chinese fleet were split into a northern and southern squadron opposing the Far East Squadron under Admiral Amédée Courbet; Fu Po was part of the northern squadron alongside the flagship , three other large ships and several gunboats. Upon the opening of the battle, the French squadron targeted the northern squadron, destroying Yangwu in the opening moments. Fu Po fled the battle, <b>steaming</b> <b>up</b> river and eventually beaching herself. As a result, she was the only surviving vessel from the northern squadron.|$|E

Early {{on the morning}} of 1 June, around 05:06, the pre-dreadnought battleships of the II Battle Squadron opened fire on what they thought were British submarines; the firing was so hysterical that it threatened to damage München and Stettin, as they were <b>steaming</b> <b>up</b> the side of the German line. The fleet commander, Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer, was forced to give a general [...] "cease-fire" [...] order. München in turn spotted an imaginary submarine off Heligoland at 11:40 and opened fire on the empty sea.In the course of the battle, München was hit by a total of five medium-caliber shells, which killed eight men and wounded another twenty. She had fired 161 rounds from her guns.|$|E
500|$|The Royal Navy search became frantic, {{as many of}} the British {{ships were}} low on fuel. Victorious and her escorting cruisers were sent west, Wake-Walker's ships {{continued}} to the south and west, and Tovey continued to steam toward the mid-Atlantic. Force H, with the aircraft carrier [...] and <b>steaming</b> <b>up</b> from Gibraltar, was still at least a day away. Unaware that he had shaken off Wake-Walker, Lütjens sent long radio messages to Naval Group West headquarters in Paris. The signals were intercepted by the British, from which bearings were determined. They were wrongly plotted on board King George V, leading Tovey to believe that Bismarck was heading back to Germany through the Iceland-Faeroe gap, which kept his fleet on the wrong course for seven hours. By the time the mistake had been discovered, Bismarck had put a sizeable gap between herself and the British ships.|$|E

500|$|On 26 August, while {{steaming}} off {{the mouth}} of the Río de la Plata, she caught two more British steamers, but the poor condition of Dresdens engines curtailed further operations. On 5 September, Dresden put into Hoste Island for engine maintenance until the 16th. While the ship was there, the HAPAG steamer [...] arrived from Punta Arenas with news of the war, and the heavy merchant traffic off the western coast of South America. Lüdecke decided to steam there, and on 18 September Dresden passed the Strait of Magellan. While en route, Dresden encountered the French steamer Lüdecke refrained from attacking the transport ship, since she had fled into neutral waters. [...] After <b>steaming</b> <b>up</b> the Chilean coast, she stopped in the Juan Fernández Islands, where she made radio contact with the light cruiser , which was operating on the Pacific coast of South America. Dresden saw no further success against British shipping, and on 12 October, she joined Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Maximilian von Spee's East Asia Squadron, which had crossed the Pacific and was coaling at Easter Island. The following day, Lüdecke was promoted to Kapitän zur See (Captain at Sea).|$|E

She arrived in Tutuila on 5 November, and stayed with the collier [...] and the hospital ship [...] {{for about two weeks}} before steaming to Apia in German Samoa. Wisconsin left the island on 21 November for Hawaii, from which she continued on to Central America. She arrived in Acapulco, Mexico on 25 December and remained there for three days to coal. She made visits to Callao, Peru and Valparaiso, Chile before returning to Acapulco on 26 February 1902. The ship then conducted a wide variety training exercises in Magdalena Bay and Pichilinque Bay from 5 to 22 March, before <b>steaming</b> <b>up</b> the west coast of the United States, stopping in Coronado, San Francisco, and Port Angeles. She arrived in the Puget Sound Navy Yard on 4 June for repairs that lasted until 11 August.|$|E
500|$|Two {{directors}} {{were assigned to}} the series – Ken Hannam and Christopher Barry. Hannam had previously directed such series as Colditz and Paul Temple while Barry had worked extensively on Doctor Who, having directed some 31 episodes at the time, including the stories The Dæmons and The Mutants for Letts and Dicks, as well as episodes of Out of the Unknown, Paul Temple and The Onedin Line. [...] Hannam and Barry alternated directing the episodes between them with filming on Moonbase 3 beginning on 24 April 1973 at the BBC film studios in Ealing. The Ealing filming mainly centred around the scenes set on the lunar surface which proved a difficult experience for the actors. Star Donald Houston told the Radio Times that the spacesuits got [...] "hot and claustrophobic. In the end they had to have oxygen standing by. [...] the dust rose in clouds and the cameramen all wore surgical masks. The actors just choked". [...] Recalling his guest appearance on Moonbase 3, in the episode [...] "Behemoth", Peter Miles told TV Zone in 1991 that he was [...] "asked to be like a gazelle and leap as I came down the hillock in full astronaut gear. [...] The tech crew wondered why I was <b>steaming</b> <b>up</b> furiously in my astronaut's head. They'd forgotten to put air holes into the helmet. [...] I said, 'Help help! Help help! I'm not breathing folks!' They took the helmet off before drilling the holes or I wouldn't be here now". [...] Filming continued at Ealing until 30 May 1973 before production moved to BBC Television Centre for the remaining scenes, mostly those set inside the moonbase, which would be recorded on videotape beginning on 18 June 1973. The episodes were recorded in a different order than that in which they were broadcast with [...] "Departure and Arrival" [...] recorded first followed by [...] "Castor and Pollux", [...] "Behemoth", [...] "View of a Dead Planet", [...] "Outsiders" [...] and, lastly, [...] "Achilles Heel" [...] with recording wrapping on 15 August 1973. [...] Music was provided by Dudley Simpson who, at this time, was the regular composer on Doctor Who. Simpson composed the main title theme that accompanied the opening and closing credits as well as approximately 60 minutes of incidental music.|$|E

2500|$|Approaching Wilmington, North Carolina, Wayanda, {{with the}} tide in her favor and under sail, [...] "astonished us all", {{according}} to Reid, [...] "by <b>steaming</b> <b>up</b> {{the river at}} the rate of fourteen knots". Wayanda was to remain at the service of Chase and his entourage for at least six weeks, travelling first along the Eastern seaboard and then up the Mississippi to New Orleans, Baton Rouge and Vicksburg before Chase continued on to Cairo, Illinois. Chase, who saw the black vote as a means of countering Democratic Party influence in the South, used his trip to lobby President Andrew Johnson for Southern black suffrage. Johnson rejected Chase's proposals.|$|E
2500|$|Andrew Dreschel of the Hamilton Spectator stated proroguing {{parliament}} was {{the right}} move, imposing a [...] "cooling-off period on the sweaty rhetoric and dank distortions that have been <b>steaming</b> <b>up</b> the political spectrum". MP Bruce Stanton said the suspension of parliament until late January [...] "was perhaps the last tool in our basket {{to be able to}} allow parliamentarians to take a step back". Before Russell revealed the conditions Jean placed on her acceptance of Harper's advice, there was some concern that Jean's decision may have set a precedent for a prime minister to seek prorogation or dissolution when confronting a potential vote of non-confidence. Nelson Wiseman, {{a professor of political science}} at the University of Toronto, said the following of Harper's advice [...] "has been a blow to parliamentary democracy in Canada" [...] and Helen Forsey, daughter of Eugene Forsey, claimed that Jean's granting of prorogation was a shameful encouragement of [...] "flagrantly subversive behaviour by a Prime Minister" [...] and that, had he still been alive, the senior Forsey's [...] "denunciations would have been ringing from the rooftops." [...] Margaret Wente at the Globe and Mail opined that the Governor General was the only person who emerged from the situation with any gained respect.|$|E
2500|$|Mullan was {{now running}} out of time. Major George A.H. Blake was <b>steaming</b> <b>up</b> the Missouri River with 300 men, {{with the intent of}} using the Mullan Road to travel to Fort Walla Walla. [...] The road had to be {{completed}} by the time he arrived, which meant that Mullan had to speed his work as well as cut corners. Twice floods destroyed his ferries (once nearly drowning Mullan himself), and Mullan was forced to bridge the Blackfoot repeatedly rather than blast and dig through hillsides (which would have meant a shorter route but taken more time). The construction crews reached Mullan Pass on July 18, 1860. The treeless summit and gradual slope to the Missouri River Canyon below signaled the end of the hardest part of the road-building effort. [...] The only difficulty yet remaining was at Tower Rock, where the crew spent four days digging and blasting for four days. The construction crew reached the Sun River on July 28, which meant the end of grading. For the last , the crew merely had to plant mile markers. Mullan completed the Mullan Road on August 1, 1860. He immediately wrote to Captain Humphreys, informing him that the southern route around Lake Pend Oreille was the incorrect one, and asking for funds and permission to reroute the Mullan Road around the north end. He then sent Theodore Kolekci downriver, with all his field notes, to deliver them to the Army in Washington, D.C.|$|E
