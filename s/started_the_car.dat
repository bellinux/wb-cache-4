25|$|After his nominal 'retirement' he {{made two}} returns to Bathurst. In 2002 he paired with Team Brock lead driver Craig Baird to a 23rd-place {{finish in the}} teams VX Commodore, Brock {{finished}} 25 laps down due to engine temperature problems. He {{then returned to the}} Holden Racing team for the 2004 Bob Jane T-Marts 1000, teaming with Englishman Jason Plato in a VY Commodore. The pair failed to finish after Plato was involved in a spectacular accident coming out of Caltex Chase with the Ozemail Falcon of fellow BTCC regular (and Brock's 1993 Bathurst co-driver) John Cleland while Cleland was lapping the Commodore (which was limping to the pits with a blown tyre) on lap 29. The clash caused the Falcon to roll and enough damage to the HRT car to be out on the spot with Brock failing to get a drive in his last Bathurst race after Plato had <b>started</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> and was due to hand over to Brock a few laps after the crash.|$|E
25|$|Nakajima {{missed the}} next two events because of Super GT commitments. Wurz took the TS030 Hybrid's first pole {{position}} on his first timed lap which he improved on minutes later at the following round of the season, the 6 Hours of São Paulo, and was nearly eight-tenths of a second faster than Audi's No. 2 car driven by Lucas di Grassi. Wurz and Lapierre maintained the No. 7's pole position advantage {{throughout most of the}} race, only ceding it to Audi during the pit stop cycles, to secure its first victory in the WEC. Lapierre qualified the No. 7 TS030 in third place for the 6 Hours of Bahrain behind the two rival Audi cars. Wurz <b>started</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> and used slower traffic to move into the lead 13 minutes into the race. Wurz and later Lapierre cemented their advantage {{at the front of the}} field over {{the next two}} hours until both illuminated number panels failed, forcing an unscheduled seven-minute pit stop for the installation of replacement parts. Lapierre and later Wurz were able to recover to third place before Laiperre made contact with Jonny Kane in the No. 21 Strakka Racing HPD ARX-03a, damaging the No. 7 TS030 Hybrid's suspension. This caused him to abandon the car at the side of the track.|$|E
2500|$|Welborn won {{his first}} race at Martinsville in 1957, but did not cross the finish line. Lewis [...] "Possum" [...] Jones {{relieved}} Welborn half way through the race, but NASCAR always credits the driver who <b>started</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> He had 1 win and 3 Top-10 finished in 5 events. Welborn also won the NASCAR Convertible series championship.|$|E

2500|$|On October 23, 1976, {{a similar}} {{shooting}} {{occurred in a}} secluded residential area of Flushing, Queens, next to Bowne Park. Carl Denaro, 20, and Rosemary Keenan, 18, were sitting in Keenan's parked car when the windows suddenly shattered. [...] "I felt the car exploded [...] ", Denaro said later. Keenan quickly <b>started</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> and sped away for help. The panicked couple {{did not realize that}} someone had been shooting at them, even though Denaro was bleeding from a bullet wound to his head. Keenan had only superficial injuries from the broken glass, but Denaro eventually needed a metal plate to replace a portion of his skull. Neither victim saw the attacker.|$|E

60|$|He <b>started.</b> <b>The</b> <b>car</b> {{had stopped}} at their house, and Malcolm was {{opening the door}} of the car. They descended silently, and went upstairs in silence.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd rather hold them," [...] she answered. [...] "Let's go on." [...] He <b>started</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> again. [...] "Listen, I {{want to talk}} to you, seriously. I've been thinking." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll have my eyes open," [...] {{answered}} the boy. [...] "Good-by!" [...] And then he <b>started</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> put on more power, and swept from the spacious grounds in grand style.|$|E
50|$|The name {{originates}} {{from early}} chauffeurs who sustained these injuries when <b>the</b> <b>car</b> back-fired while <b>the</b> chauffeur was hand-cranking to <b>start</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> <b>The</b> back-fire forced the crank backward into the chauffeur's palm and produced the characteristic styloid fracture. It {{is also known}} as a backfire fracture (for the same reason) or a Hutchinson fracture.|$|R

6000|$|... "Maybe Brassy--I mean Lester--came up {{and tried}} to <b>start</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> while <b>the</b> gears were in mesh," [...] {{suggested}} Jack; [...] "and then when <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>started</b> to run away perhaps he got scared and ran away, too." ...|$|R

6000|$|He turned nervously in {{his seat}} {{to get a look}} at her, then shifted the clutch and slowly <b>started</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> The woman sat quiet. While bumping over the uneven road at a {{reckless}} speed the driver turned at times to cast stealthy glances at the person beside him. Finally he asked in exasperation: ...|$|E
60|$|Carrie <b>started</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> {{and when}} it rolled away Jake looked at his comrade. Jim wore thin shoes and a light coat over his dinner jacket; the road was wet and the low ground dotted by shining pools. It was some time after high-water and a gentle breeze blew across the marsh. A {{half-moon}} shone between slowly-drifting clouds.|$|E
50|$|The plaintiff, {{originally}} the passenger, {{asked if he}} could drive in an attempt to roll <b>start</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> <b>The</b> defendant agreed, aware that he had consumed 11 or 12 bottles of beer that evening. The plaintiff lost control of <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> which left <b>the</b> road down the steep slope and flipped over. The plaintiff suffered severe head injuries as a result.|$|R
2500|$|He {{sold his}} {{construction}} company in 1978 {{to buy the}} Radici & Wise funny car operation. He initially {{did not have enough}} experience with funny <b>cars</b> to <b>start</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> He had to get a friend with alcohol experience to <b>start</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> He went across the United States for three months with Sid Waterman at California to learn about <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> Hofmann said, [...] "He wanted me to be a hands-on racer, not just a driver. So he had me take the engine apart and put it together about ten times. He felt it would help my driving if I had a better mechanical understanding of the car." ...|$|R
2500|$|... 2007 – Alcoguard, a {{hand-held}} device {{that the driver}} blows into before they can <b>start</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> mainly aimed for the company-car sector, taxi operators, state authorities and municipalities (S80, V70, XC70) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{country is}} getting filthy with foreigners," [...] he observed, {{when he had}} <b>started</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> [...] "I went down to Plymouth last summer to see the old rock, and by George, {{it seemed as if}} there wasn't anybody could speak American on the whole cape. All the Portuguese islands are dumped there--cranberry pickers, you know." ...|$|E
60|$|He turned {{with her}} towards the car, {{and she gave}} a low cry. He too <b>started.</b> <b>The</b> <b>car</b> was a mile away, tearing up a hill, and almost out of sight. In the lane behind {{they could hear the}} sound of {{galloping}} horses. He caught her by the wrist, dragged her through the gate, and behind a great shrub on the lawn.|$|E
60|$|Billie meanwhile, with Bream {{trotting}} docilely at her heels, {{had reached}} the garage and <b>started</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> Like all cars which have been spending a considerable time in secluded inaction, it did not start readily. At each application of Billie's foot on the self-starter, it emitted a tinny and reproachful sound and then seemed {{to go to sleep}} again. Eventually, however, the engines began to revolve and the machine moved reluctantly out into the drive.|$|E

5000|$|First BMW {{to feature}} [...] "Push-Button-Start". The {{rectangular}} key-fob was inserted {{into a slot}} next to {{the steering wheel and}} the driver would push a button to <b>start</b> <b>the</b> engine. This method of <b>starting</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> would be <b>the</b> precursor for all future BMW models.|$|R
60|$|He {{ran down}} the steps and as he <b>started</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> the others jumped up. Mordaunt had not meant to take Carrie, but he did not stop and the car sped away. He let her go full-speed down the hill, dashed through the awkward gateway, {{touching}} the post, and drove furiously to the bend where the road ran on to the marsh. Then there was a violent jerk as he put on the brakes, and the beam of the head-lamps touched and stopped upon a tilted car that lay with the wheels on one side in the ditch.|$|E
6000|$|Anderson manifestly {{controlled}} strong feeling. Lenore saw Jake's hand {{go to her}} father's shoulder. [...] "Boss," [...] he whispered, [...] "we can't ketch thet car now." [...] Anderson resigned himself, averted {{his face}} {{so that he could}} not see Nash, who was tinkering with the engine. Lenore believed then that Nash had deliberately stalled the engine or disordered something, so as to permit the escape of the strange car ahead. She saw it turn off the long, straight road ahead and disappear to the right. After some minutes' delay Nash resumed his seat and <b>started</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> once more.|$|E
60|$|They {{dragged the}} man's body on to a chair, wrapped a huge coat around him, tied a {{motoring}} cap under his chin, fixed goggles over his eyes. Sir Richard strolled {{into the hall}} and opened the front door. He stood there for a moment, looking up and down the street. When he gave the signal they dragged him out, supported between them, across the pavement, into the car. Ugh! His attitude was so natural as to be absolutely ghastly. Merries <b>started</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> and sprang into the driver's seat. There were people in the Square now, but the figure reclining in the dark, cushioned interior looked perfectly natural.|$|E
50|$|In a <b>car</b> or truck, <b>the</b> {{starter solenoid}} {{is part of}} an {{automobile}} <b>starting</b> system. <b>The</b> starter solenoid receives a large electric current from <b>the</b> <b>car</b> battery and a small electric current from the ignition switch. When the ignition switch is turned on (i.e. when the key is turned to <b>start</b> <b>the</b> <b>car),</b> <b>the</b> small electric current forces the starter solenoid to close a pair of heavy contacts, thus relaying the large electric current to the starter motor.|$|R
25|$|The Jaguar {{made the}} early running over the bike on the A1 road due to Hammond's failure to <b>start</b> <b>the</b> bike, {{although}} Tornado {{was in the}} overall lead from <b>the</b> <b>start.</b> <b>The</b> <b>car</b> and bike interchanged places while making their respective re-fuelling stops at filling stations.|$|R
60|$|Though {{this time}} he heard his own voice and {{knew that it was}} curt, though she was looking at him with wide-eyed reproach, he stumped into the hall, jerked on his ulster and furlined gloves, and went out to <b>start</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b>|$|R
