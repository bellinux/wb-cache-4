40|$|Abstract In this paper, {{the authors}} discuss the vortex {{structure}} of an anisotropic Ginzburg–Landau model for <b>superconducting</b> <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> proposed by Du. We obtain the estimate {{for the lower}} critical magnetic field HC 1 {{which is the first}} critical value of hex corresponding to the first phase transition in which vortices appear in the superconductor. We also find local minimizers of the anisotropic <b>superconducting</b> <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> with a large parameter κ, and for the applied magnetic field near the critical field we discuss the asymptotic behavior of the local minimizers...|$|E
40|$|Techniques {{have been}} {{developed}} with which {{it is possible to}} fabricate <b>superconducting</b> <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> structures (“bridges”) which show Josephson-like phenomena, {{with a wide variety of}} electrical and superconducting parameters. These bridges—based on the proximity effect—are made in layered thin film substrates which have been fabricated from many different, both hard and soft, superconducting materials. The fabrication techniques and the electrical and superconducting characteristics for these proximity effect bridges including a simple low frequency (≤ 10 [*]GHz) equivalent circuit will be discussed. These bridges have been incorporated into simple thin film circuits for use as galvanometers, magnetometers, gradiometers, detector arrays, etc. Extension of these techniques to more complex <b>superconducting</b> <b>thin</b> <b>film</b> bridge circuits including resistors, capacitors, and inductors will be indicated...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} transport properties of ferromagnetic nanostructures made by nickel or cobalt on <b>superconducting</b> <b>thin</b> <b>films.</b> The <b>superconducting</b> <b>thin</b> <b>films</b> {{were covered by}} an insulating layer, and the periodic ferromagnetic nanostructures were fabricated {{on top of the}} insulating layer. On separate <b>superconducting</b> <b>thin</b> <b>films,</b> periodic ferromagnetic nanostructures were embedded into the <b>thin</b> <b>films.</b> The photolithography method was used to make contact pads for a four-probe measurement. In order to fabricate the magnetic nanostructures, an Electron Beam Lithography (EBL) system was utilized. The nanoscale patterns were filled with ferromagnetic materials by using a thermal evaporating method or an electroplating technique. The superconducting properties were measured at low temperature (2. 0 K<T< 8. 0 K) for low temperature superconductors and at high temperature (85. 0 K<T< 90. 0 K) for high temperature superconductors with a Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS). Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and an Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) were used to characterize the nanoscale structures. Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM) was also used to study their magnetic properties. Superconductivity and ferromagnetism seems mutually exclusive states, however the superconducting and the ferromagnetic states show new and exciting properties when the two states affect each other at the nanoscale: hysteresis and enhanced superconductivity. Both the ferromagnetic nanostructures on the <b>superconducting</b> <b>thin</b> <b>films</b> and the embedded ferromagnetic nanosized arrays in the <b>superconducting</b> <b>thin</b> <b>films</b> exhibited an enhanced critical current density and critical magnetic field. Both of the samples also showed hysteresis and a field matching effect by the artificial ferromagnetic nanostructures when an external magnetic field was applied. The <b>superconducting</b> <b>thin</b> <b>films</b> with the ferromagnetic nanostructures system may be useful for power cable and other low magnetic field applications...|$|R
