25|$|Faroese written {{literature}} has only really {{developed in the}} past 100–200 years. This is {{mainly because of the}} islands' isolation, and also because the Faroese language was not written down in a <b>standardised</b> <b>format</b> until 1890. The Danish language was also encouraged at the expense of Faroese. Nevertheless, the Faroes have produced several authors and poets. A rich centuries-old oral tradition of folk tales and Faroese folk songs accompanied the Faroese chain dance. The people learned these songs and stories by heart, and told or sung them to each other, teaching the younger generations too. This kind of literature was gathered in the 19th century and early 20th century. The Faroese folk songs, in Faroese called kvæði, are still in use although not so large-scale as earlier. Some of the Faroese folk songs have been used by the Faroese Viking metal band Týr, i.e., Ormurin Langi.|$|E
25|$|Authors were {{increasingly}} expected to submit manuscripts in a <b>standardised</b> <b>format</b> and style. From 1896, they {{were encouraged to}} submit typed papers on foolscap-folio-sized paper to lighten the work of getting papers ready for printing, and to reduce the chance of error in the process. A publishable paper now had to present its information in an appropriate manner, {{as well as being}} of remarkable scientific interest. For a brief period between 1907 and 1914, authors were under even more pressure to conform to the society's expectations, due to a decision to discuss cost estimates of candidate papers alongside referees' reports. The committees could require authors {{to reduce the number of}} illustrations or tables or, indeed, the overall length of the paper, as a condition of acceptance. It was hoped that this policy would reduce the still-rising costs of production, which had reached £1747 in 1906; but the effect appears to have been negligible, and the cost estimates ceased to be routine practice after 1914.|$|E

This is mainly because of the island's isolation, and also because the Faroese language was not written down in a <b>standardised</b> <b>format</b> until 1890.

To be a Ricardian Contract, {{it has to be}} parsable both by the program and by a human reader.

40|$|This paper aims {{to motivate}} the {{hypothesis}} that practical interoperability {{can be seen as}} a function of whether and how stakeholder communities duplicate or divide work in a given area or market. We focus on the area of language processing which traditionally produces many diverse tools that are not immediately interoperable. However, there is also a strong desire to combine these tools into processing pipelines and to apply these to a wide range of different corpora. The space opened between generic, inherently “empty” interoperability frameworks that offer no NLP capabilities themselves and dedicated NLP tools gave rise to a new class of NLP-related projects that focus specifically on interoperability: component collections. This new class of projects drives interoperability in a very pragmatic way that could well be more successful than, e. g., past efforts towards <b>standardised</b> <b>formats</b> which ultimately saw little adoption or support by software tools...|$|R

The style was used for workers' housing in industrial districts during the rapid urbanisation following the industrial revolution, particularly in the houses built for workers of the expanding textile industry. The terrace style spread widely across the country, and was the usual form of high-density residential housing up to World War II.

This is mainly because the Faroese language was not written down in a <b>standardised</b> <b>format</b> until 1890 (in 1854 Venceslaus Ulricus Hammershaimb published a written standard for Modern Faroese that exists to this day. He produced orthography consistent with a continuous written tradition extending back to Old Norse). The Danish language was also encouraged at the expense of Faroese. Nevertheless, the Faroes have produced several authors and poets. The most famous of these authors are Jørgen-Frantz Jacobsen (known for his sole novel Barbara) and William Heinesen. Both authors wrote in Danish. Other famous authors from the Faroes include Heðin Brú (The Old Man and His Sons) and Jóanes Nielsen. Poets include the brothers Janus and Hans Andreas Djurhuus, and Rói Patursson.Both Heinesen and Patursson have been awarded The Nordic Council's Literature Prize.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Human Proteome Organisation — Proteomics Standards Initiative (HUPO-PSI) {{has been}} working for ten years on the {{development}} of <b>standardised</b> <b>formats</b> that facilitate data sharing and public database deposition. In this article, we review three HUPO-PSI data standards — mzML, mzIdentML and mzQuantML, which can be used to design a complete quantitative analysis pipeline in mass spectrometry (MS) -based proteomics. In this tutorial, we briefly describe the content of each data model, sufficient for bioinformaticians to devise proteomics software. We also provide guidance on the use of recently released application programming interfaces (APIs) developed in Java for each of these standards, which makes it straightforward to read and write files of any size. We have produced a set of example Java classes and a basic graphical user interface to demonstrate how to use the most important parts of the PSI standards, available from [URL] This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Computational Proteomics in the Post-Identification Era.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Content {{analysis}} {{is a research}} technique used to organise large amounts of textual data into <b>standardised</b> <b>formats</b> which allows arriving at suggestions/conclusions. Content analysis {{can be carried out}} quantitatively by counting the words or qualitatively by coding. The former approach refers to counting the frequency of the keywords and the later refers to identifying similar themes or concepts from the data set. This paper discusses the use of conceptual content analysis by using computerised software to analyse data gathered from semi-structured interviews. The context of the research within which content {{analysis is}} used is to identify the influence of performance measurement towards construction research activities. The paper first explains the research methodology pertaining to this study by reasoning out the selection of case study research approach coupled with semi-structured interviews. The paper then discusses how the information gathered from semi-structured interviews is fed into the computerised software to identify and generate main concepts of the study...|$|R
40|$|Representing {{annotated}} spoken corpora The annotation {{of linguistic}} resources has long-standing traditions (see Cole et al., 2010).

However, a largevariety of annotation formatshave been developed in the previous decades, each one created for a specific research task. Consequently,the resulting resources are frequently only usable by members of the individual research projects.
