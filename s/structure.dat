25|$|The {{rise of the}} <b>structured</b> {{programming}} movement led to {{many other}} <b>structured</b> approaches applied to software design. The techniques of <b>structured</b> analysis and <b>structured</b> design are outgrowths of <b>structured</b> programming concepts and techniques, and of the early ideas about modular design. Principles of modularity were strengthened by Larry Constantine's concepts of coupling (to be minimized between modules) and cohesion (to be maximized within modules), by David Parnas's techniques of information hiding, and by abstract data types. A number of tools and methods employing <b>structured</b> concepts were developed, such as <b>Structured</b> Design, Jackson's <b>Structured</b> Programming, Ross' <b>Structured</b> Analysis and Design Technique (SADT), Yourdon's <b>Structured</b> Method, <b>Structured</b> Systems Analysis and Design Method (SSADM), and James Martin's Information Engineering.

40|$|AbstractThis on the web, most <b>structured</b> {{document}} collections {{consist of}} documents from different sources and marked up with {{different types of}} <b>structures.</b> The diversity of <b>structures</b> has lead {{to the emergence of}} heterogeneous <b>structured</b> documents. The heterogeneity of <b>structured</b> documents poses new challenges for document representation in <b>structured</b> document retrieval. The representation model needs to handle various types of <b>structures</b> as well as multiple <b>structures</b> in a single document. Furthermore, same information may be represented in different <b>structures</b> and information contained in different documents may be partial and inconsistent. Therefore, the linkage of semantically related elements in the document collections needs to be modelled in the representation model. In this paper, we introduce a generic and flexible <b>structured</b> document model to represent heterogeneous <b>structured</b> documents as well as the similar correspondences in the document collections...|$|R
