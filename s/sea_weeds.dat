Field and line officers gathered in groups and spoke more learnedly of what they apprehended with no greater clearness. Commanders of brigades and divisions looked anxiously to their connections on the right and on the left, sent staff officers on errands of inquiry and pushed skirmish lines silently and cautiously forward into the dubious region between the known and the unknown. At some points on the line the troops, apparently of their own volition, constructed such defenses as they could without the silent spade and the noisy ax.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The {{present study}} is aimed to {{investigate}} the ability of Kappaphycus alverazii to reduce silver nitrate into silver nanoparticles. The <b>sea</b> <b>weed,</b> Kappaphycus alverazii was collected from the coasts of Rameswaram, Ramanathapuram district of Tamil Nadu, India. The <b>sea</b> <b>weed</b> broth was prepared and resuspended in an aqueous solution of 1 mM silver nitrate in 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask. This mixture is known as reaction medium. The reduction of silver nitrate into silver nanoparticles in the reaction medium was monitored by keeping it in an incubator cum shaker with 250 rpm at 27 °C for 96 hours. From this reaction medium, a small aliquot {{of the sample was}} used for the characterization of silver nanoparticles through UV-Visible spectroscopic analysis, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectral analysis, X-Ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, Scanning Electron Microscopic (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyses. The time dependant spectral analysis provides the evidence of synthesis of nanoparticles. The FTIR analysis explains the stability of silver nanoparticles that are synthesized by the <b>sea</b> <b>weed.</b> The XRD analysis gives the structural information of nanoparticles. The SEM and EDX analyses confirmed the synthesis of nanoparticles. Thus eco-friendly synthesis of silver nanoparticles is achieved using the <b>sea</b> <b>weed,</b> Kappaphycus alverazii, as there is no involvement of toxic chemicals as reducing agents in this biological synthesis.
