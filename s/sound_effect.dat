5|$|DJ Hero 2 is {{a rhythm}} video {{game and a}} sequel to DJ Hero, a spinoff of the Guitar Hero series. DJ Hero 2 uses a special turntable-controller, the same as {{introduced}} in DJ Hero, to simulate turntablism, the act of creating a new musical work from one or more previously recorded songs using record players and <b>sound</b> <b>effect</b> generators. The game is developed by FreeStyleGames and is published by Activision, and was released worldwide in October 2010.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the signal}} {{light in the}} {{locomotive}} turns green, the journey from the Main Street, U.S.A. section begins with the train traversing a small bridge, passing by the Adventureland section, and going through a tunnel before arriving at New Orleans Square Station in the New Orleans Square section. While the train is stopped at this station, where the locomotive takes on water from the railroad's water tower if needed, a <b>sound</b> <b>effect</b> of a telegraph operator using a telegraph key to enter Morse code can be heard emanating from the old Frontierland Station depot building. The <b>sound</b> <b>effect</b> continuously repeats the first two lines of Walt Disney's 1955 Disneyland dedication speech. Adjacent to the old Frontierland Station depot building, a freight house building used as a train crew break and storage area can be seen, {{as well as a}} fully functioning historic semaphore signal connected to the station's block signal.|$|E
5|$|Port Royal, {{based on}} , {{contains}} the most content edits. Cutscenes were edited to {{remove some of}} the violence, such as William Turner threatening to commit suicide while aiming a gun at his neck, as in the film.

5|$|Another parodied film is the 1964 thriller Fail-Safe by Sidney Lumet: at the {{beginning}} of the third act of the episode, scenes of everyday life across Springfield are shown, and one by one, with a 'zooming' <b>sound</b> <b>effect,</b> they all freeze-frame in anticipation of the (supposedly) imminent nuclear blast; such was the ending of Fail-Safe. One of the scenes before the supposed nuclear blast shows Maggie picking flowers in a field, with the camera zooming into her eye, and then the minuscule blast occurs. This is a parody of the infamous and controversial Daisy ad used by Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1964 United States presidential election.|$|E
5|$|DJ Hero is a {{music video}} game, {{developed}} by FreeStyleGames {{and published by}} Activision as a rhythm game spin-off of the Guitar Hero franchise. It was released on October 27, 2009 in North America and on October 29, 2009 in Europe. The game is based on turntablism, the act of creating a new musical work from one or more previously recorded songs using record players and <b>sound</b> <b>effect</b> generators, and features 94 remixes of two different songs from a selection of over 100 different songs across numerous genres.|$|E
5|$|Initially given a blue color scheme, the TIE fighter {{models for}} the first film were grey to better film against a bluescreen; TIE fighters in The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983) shifted {{back to being a}} muted blue. Sound {{designer}} Ben Burtt created the distinctive TIE fighter <b>sound</b> <b>effect</b> by combining an elephant call with a car driving on wet pavement. Combat scenes between TIE fighters and the Millennium Falcon and Rebel Alliance X-wing fighters in Star Wars were meant to be reminiscent of World War II dogfight footage; editors used World War II air combat clips as placeholders while Industrial Light & Magic completed the movie's special effects. Darth Vader's distinct TIE advanced X1 in Star Wars was designed to make it instantly recognizable, and the TIE interceptors developed for Jedi were designed to look fast, deadly, and frightening.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to explore how {{children}} may perceive <b>sound</b> <b>effects</b> in the specially written radio saga made for this paper Ninjas Detektivbyrå (Ninja’s Detective firm). If <b>sound</b> <b>effects</b> in any way can contribute to children perceiving more details, if specific <b>sound</b> <b>effects</b> may bestow in creating a more monogamous distinction of signs and whether the dramaturgical structure possibly can become clearer when combining dialog with <b>sound</b> <b>effects.</b> The study was made possible with the help of two groups of children whom each listened to a version of the stimulus material, one with <b>sound</b> <b>effects</b> and the other one without <b>sound</b> <b>effects,</b> and by qualitative interviews relaying on theories regarding communication, classical dramaturgy and research on how <b>sound</b> <b>effects</b> impact on audience. This paper shows that the participants who were exposed to <b>sound</b> <b>effects</b> may have been more keen to perceiving details, understood signs more distinctly and could account for greater parts of the story in comparison to participants from the group that weren’t exposed to <b>sound</b> <b>effects.</b> Validerat; 20150630 (global_studentproject_submitter) </p...|$|R
5|$|The soundtrack for Silent Hill was {{composed}} by sound director Akira Yamaoka, who requested {{to join the}} development staff after the original musician had left. In addition to the music, {{he was in charge}} of tasks such as <b>sound</b> <b>effect</b> creation and audio mastering. Yamaoka did not watch game scenes, but created the music independently from its visuals. The style of his compositions was influenced by Twin Peaks composer Angelo Badalamenti. To differentiate Silent Hill from other games as much as possible, and to give it a cold and rusty feel, Yamaoka opted for industrial music. When he presented his musical pieces to the other staff members for the first time, they misinterpreted their sound as a game bug. Yamaoka had to explain that this noise was intended for the music, and the team only withdrew their initial objection after he elaborated on his reasons for choosing this style.|$|E
5|$|The {{speaker is}} named after its inventor, Donald Leslie, who began working in the late 1930s to get a speaker for a Hammond organ that better {{emulated}} a pipe or theatre organ, and discovered that rotating the speaker gave the best <b>sound</b> <b>effect.</b> Hammond {{was not interested in}} marketing or selling the speakers, so Leslie sold them himself as an add-on, targeting other organs as well as Hammond. Leslie made the first speaker in 1941. The sound of the organ being played through his speakers received national radio exposure across the US, and it became a commercial and critical success. It soon became an essential tool for most jazz organists. In 1965, Leslie sold his business to CBS who, in 1980, sold it to Hammond. Suzuki Musical Instrument Corporation subsequently acquired the Hammond and Leslie brands.|$|E

Music grow together with human technologies, from the simplest music until modern music that arranged by the computer. <b>Sound</b> <b>effects</b> created in order to give enrichment to the music and fulfill the taste of music from the listeners. Six electronic <b>sound</b> <b>effects</b> which are ring modulation, chorus, flanging, echo, reverb, and phase-shifter designed into a single integrated electronic construction called the electronic <b>sound</b> <b>effects.</b> It is designed to achieve varieties and enrichment in music, especially for acoustic guitar.

Electrical tests arranged in the computer laboratory by using digital oscilloscope, function generator and frequency counter in purpose to get the appropriate design according to the theories and to measure the electronic <b>sound</b> <b>effects</b> performances.

The result from this project is not completely success because the pick-up's gain is too small. It is proved by the electrical tests. The pick-up is very important to the electronic <b>sound</b> <b>effects</b> in order to get a good input signal from acoustic guitar.
