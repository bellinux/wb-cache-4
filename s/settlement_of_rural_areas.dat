He was Minister of Lands and Immigration, Minister of Defence and Minister of Native Affairs (relations with Māori). In his role as Minister of Lands he encouraged intensive <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> <b>rural</b> <b>areas,</b> aiming {{to increase the number}} of people leaving the cities to [...] "work the land", which he believed was essential to increase productivity and self-sufficiency. His system of state-aided [...] "village settlements" [...] - small holdings were leased by the Crown to farmers and money lent them to make a beginning of building and cultivation - was generally successful.|$|E
50|$|The Rosewood Scrub, an area {{comprising}} {{what is now}} Tallegalla, developed in the late 1870s as settlers followed timber getters who cleared some of the dense vine scrub previously thought to be impenetrable. By 1880 fifty selections were taken up in the area, mostly by German migrants who were arriving in Queensland under migration schemes run by the Queensland Government aimed at encouraging closer <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> <b>rural</b> <b>areas.</b> After the Land Act of 1868 land in the Rosewood Scrub, {{to the west of}} Brisbane, was opened for clearing and settlement. The area became known as Tallegalla and an official survey was completed in July 1872. A small township developed which comprised school, rail station, post office, two churches, hotel and cemetery. In 1997 very little remains of the Tallegalla township, with only the school and cemetery apparent.|$|E

The literature review {{concentrates on the}} explanation of the notion "countryside" and on the definition of countryside in the South Moravian Region. A typology of countryside in terms of demographics is formulated in the next chapter. Within the results, rural areas in individual districts of municipalities with extended authority and authorized municipal office are characterized. Using the parameters described in each district, the typology of South Moravian countryside {{in terms of its}} development was designed. The South Moravian countryside is divided into 4 types. The final discussion covers the geographic classification of individual types of countryside...|$|E

In addition, the railroad actively promoted <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> it served, providing free seeds, trees, and tree seedlings to farmers and ranchers to promote cotton and wheat growing as well as erosion prevention.|$|R
50|$|A basic {{distinction}} that cuts {{across the entire}} geography of the Arabic-speaking world is between sedentary and nomadic varieties (often misleadingly called Bedouin). The distinction stems from the settlement patterns {{in the wake of}} the Arab conquests. As regions were conquered, army camps were set up that eventually grew into cities, and <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> by Nomadic Arabs gradually followed thereafter. In some areas, sedentary dialects are divided further into urban and rural variants.|$|R

50|$|In the 1850s, in {{response}} to a drive by the state of Wisconsin to increase <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> its <b>rural</b> <b>areas,</b> immigrants from the area that is now Belgium began to arrive in the state. Originating in the provinces of Namur and Brabant, the settled on the eastern shore areas of Brown, Kewaunee, and Door counties. They used indigenous materials in combination with traditional building practices imported from their homeland to construct an architecturally distinct landscape. Houses were typically built out of either red brick or limestone, with frame outbuildings. In the 1860 and 1870 censuses Wisconsin had a higher percentage of Belgian-origin residents than any other state. The area around the village of Namur was judged in a wide-ranging survey of Belgian-settled areas to best represent this influx.|$|R
40|$|The role of {{water-borne}} {{transportation in}} various areas of Indonesia is {{felt to be}} very important, especially in those more remote places, which are unreachable, by land transportation. The potential of rivers, especially in serving access for people in remote area is enormous. Compared with currently 300, 000 km or roads, Indonesia has utilized only 21, 579 km navigable rivers. Although {{it is a very}} important mode of transport, yet such is the case that this form of transport is no longer flexible in anticipating the <b>settlement</b> development patterns <b>of</b> <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> which oftentimes are not oriented around water. This {{can be seen in the}} proportion of government funding in study areas for water transport is very small compared with land transport. Another problem faced by rural water transport is safety caused by inadequate infrastructure and standard. Regulation and institutional concerns were important issues in three study areas...|$|R
40|$|The general {{practitioner}} {{is the key}} element within most rural health care delivery systems, virtually controlling referal {{to higher levels of}} care as well as providing basic care. In consequence of the progressive urban-based centralization of health care facilities and specialized personnel encouraged by the desire to take advantage of economies of scale in supply, the role of the {{general practitioner}} within rural health care delivery has become increasingly crucial. However, the supply of general practitioners in <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> has not kept pace with demands, and accessibility to physicians has become a pressing issue in many <b>rural</b> <b>areas.</b> Although 'accessibility' is not taken to be synonymous with physical or geographical accessibility, the dispersed <b>settlement</b> characteristic <b>of</b> most <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> elevates the latter to a position of primary importance. Following a discussion of the merits of measures of accessibility based upon utilization versus measures based upon the relative location of population and physicians, a measure on potential physical accessibility is presented and applied to a Canadian data set. The results suggest that although considerable differences in potential accessibility exist between <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> near and far from urban centres, the smaller catchment populations <b>of</b> most <b>rural</b> general practitioners may partly compensate for isolation from major, urban concentrations of physicians. ...|$|R
40|$|As {{a tribute}} to the massive {{contribution}} of our friend and colleague Graeme Hugo to the population and <b>settlement</b> geography <b>of</b> Australian <b>rural</b> <b>areas,</b> this paper presents a longitudinal study from his home State. It forms part of a wider study of the long-term demographic relationships between Australia’s rapidly growing regional cities and their surrounding functional regions. Of particular interest is the question of what effect the accelerating concentration of population and economic activity into a given regional city will have for the longer term demographic sustainability of its functional region as a whole. Taking the case of Port Lincoln, regional capital of most of South Australia’s Eyre Peninsula, it examines the nature of change in the functional region over the period 1947 – 2011, and investigates the forces feeding, and partly counteracting, the population concentration process, informed by concepts of evolutionary economic geography. In particular it traces the demographic impact (particularly differential migration and ageing trends) of exogenous shocks to the region’s essentially primary productive economic base during the period of major change from 1981 to 2011.

40|$|Growing number <b>of</b> <b>settlements</b> in <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> in Japan were {{supposed}} to have been endangered due to population outflow and the low birthrate. Based on reports made a half century ago on four settlements in Iwate Prefecture of the Tohoku district of Japan, we 2 ̆ 7 ve conducted a questionnaire survey to compare the current situations with those of the previous reports. In the paper, we compare each settlement, observing how the age brackets within the population compositions have changed, since it is believed to be an important factor for folk events to be maintained. Then, we review in detail "Drawing of the sacred water" on New Year 2 ̆ 7 s Day, one of the annual folk events. How and in what form has the event described in the reports 50 years ago developed been maintained up to now? Although it had vanished in some settlements, leaving just memories of it in residents in the reports of 50 years ago, it has been proved that there are some homes, if not many, which are still practicing the ritual event. However, it has also been proved that long held cultures have not necessarily been maintained even if only a few families in settlements with old history have maintained such folk events. We should draw attention to the methods of maintaining folk customs and collecting documents...|$|R

Existing measures of state support are aimed at modernization of agricultural production {{with the purpose of}} overcoming the systemic crisis of agriculture and ensuring food security of the country. The effectiveness of measures aimed at social development <b>of</b> <b>rural</b> <b>areas</b> has led to some strengthening of social infrastructure, but had no significant impact on the depopulation <b>of</b> the <b>rural</b> population due to the high natural attrition and migration, the cause of which lies in low quality <b>of</b> <b>rural</b> life and unpopularity <b>of</b> <b>rural</b> lifestyle and agricultural labor.
