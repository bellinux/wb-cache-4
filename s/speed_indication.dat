50|$|In {{addition}} to these aspects there is Yellow-over-Green, which carries the meaning 'Reduce to Medium speed' (35 km/h) and is used when the next signal displays one of the Medium <b>speed</b> <b>indications.</b> If the top light (normal speed) only displays red (such as departing from a crossing loop), it is only fitted with a red aspect. If the lower light (medium speed) only displays red, it is often replaced with a red reflector {{in place of a}} red light.|$|R

As a result of a December 1, 2013, train derailment in the Bronx on the Metro-North Railroad, railroads with similar cab signal systems to Metro-North, such as the LIRR, were ordered to modify the systems to enforce certain speed limit changes, which has resulted in lower average speeds and actual speed limits across the LIRR.|$|R
40|$|A {{method that}} {{utilizes}} the Doppler effect on radio signals {{for determining the}} speed of an airplane and the distance traveled by the airplane has been developed and found to operate satisfactorily. In this method, called the NACA radio ground-speed system, standard readily available radio equipment is used almost exclusively and extreme frequency stability of the transmitters is not necessary. No complicated equipment need be carried in the airplane, as the standard radio transmitter is usually adequate. Actual flight tests were made in which the method was used {{and the results were}} consistent with calibrated air <b>speed</b> <b>indications</b> and stop-watch measurements. Inasmuch as the fundamental accuracy of the radio method is far better than either of the checking systems used, no check was made on the limitations of the accuracy...|$|R

50|$|The {{sequence}} of aspects on {{the approach to}} a preceding train {{in areas where the}} Low <b>Speed</b> <b>indication</b> is in use is as follows: Clear, Medium, Caution, Low Speed, Stop. In some cases, the Medium indication will be exhibited at two consecutive signals. At some locations, the Low <b>Speed</b> <b>indication</b> will only be exhibited under reduced overlap conditions (e.g. owing to the presence of a train ahead).

40|$|This study {{reports the}} effect of nanoscaled surface {{structure}} of some hard coatings on the (micro-) frictional behaviour of systems under minimum lubrication conditions with modest contact pressures and low sliding speeds (below 1 mm/s). For this purpose, Cr-N coatings with a randomly crater-like topography and with varying dimensions of surface features {{as well as a}} smooth Cr-N surface were tested with a microtribometer. The friction on the samples was measured {{as a function of the}} viscosity of the applied mineral base oil and the sliding velocity. For all tests, the structured surfaces exhibited lower friction than the smooth surface. Furthermore, it was possible to detect variations in the lubrication-promoting effect of the structures depending on the oil viscosity and the sliding <b>speed.</b> <b>Indications</b> for the existence of an optimum topographic scale for this type of surface structure were found.

50|$|The {{return spring}} is {{calibrated}} such {{that a given}} revolution speed of the cable corresponds to a specific <b>speed</b> <b>indication</b> on the speedometer.

50|$|Projected {{traffic density}} {{warranted}} {{the introduction of}} additional signal indications. One of these was a small green light under the two main red lights of a Stop signal, indicating Low Speed. The Low <b>Speed</b> <b>indication</b> was provided in the Underground City Railway from its opening on 28 February 1932. The standard speed restriction imposed by train stops with the Low <b>Speed</b> <b>indication</b> was originally 17 mph. However, at some locations, the maximum permissible speed is as low as 5 mph, subject to local conditions. In the Underground City and Eastern Suburbs railway lines, a speed restriction of 30 mph also applies to the Caution indication. The train stops can be seen dropping as the signals step-up to Medium. Closely spaced 'multi home signals', {{similar to those used}} on the London Underground, are also a feature of the Underground City and Eastern Suburbs lines. Speed control by intermediate train stops, based on Mr Byles' system, was introduced on the London Underground following the accident at Moorgate on 28 February 1975, in which 43 people were killed.|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a revolutionary <b>speed</b> limit <b>indication</b> system using ultrasonic ceramic transmitters and receivers. Two speed zones are distinguished by detecting two different ASCII characters transmitted through the air, and then converting {{them into a}} latch indication system on the speedometer. The transmission circuit is built to simulate signal processing. The program is done in HCll language and a microchip MC 68 HC 24 FN is used to perform the operations. We show that the new system is capable of detecting multiple speed zones...|$|R
50|$|At high <b>speed</b> {{junction}}s, turnout <b>indications</b> are {{no longer}} provided. Instead, the signal in rear of the junction signal is provided with a directional indicator.

5000|$|An {{additional}} subsidiary indication below a {{stop signal}} is the Close Up. This appears {{similar to the}} Low <b>Speed</b> <b>indication,</b> except that the subsidiary green light is provided in a separate lamp case below a plate labelled [...] "CLOSE UP". Speed control {{does not apply to}} the Close Up indication, which is manually selected by the Signaller in most cases and indicates that the section is clear but the station or junction ahead is blocked. Close Up signals are equivalent to the British warning ("W") signal for restricted acceptance. They now being superseded by approach-controlled Caution indications for reduced-overlap working.|$|E
50|$|BEA {{then found}} that the crew may have been {{suffering}} a somatogravic illusion in flight. Somatogravic illusion, in aviation, {{is a type of}} optical illusion which can cause the crew to think that they are pitching up, while in reality, they are not. This could happen during night-time flying (causing the crew to lose their visual reference, as it was dark) accompanied by the lack of monitoring of the flight's indicator. Somatogravic illusion was responsible for the crash of Gulf Air Flight 072 in Bahrain. However, the BEA also suspected the specific features of the <b>speed</b> <b>indication</b> on the PFD, especially speed limitations for the Airbus A320 configuration that are shown as the red bars {{at the top of the}} <b>speed</b> <b>indication</b> strip. One of the crew members might have adopted the reflex acquired in training, for example, in response to a TCAS warning when the pilot is anxious to avoid the displayed red part of the instrument scale, which may result in the instinctive forward movement of the side stick, especially when the pilot is in a state of psycho-emotional strain. This version is substantiated by the fact that the pilot was monitoring the flight speed and its limitations (VFE) that depended on the Airbus A320 configuration and retracted the flaps and slats in a timely manner, and the control inputs on the side stick coincided with the moments when the current speed was getting close to the limit value. However, neither of these probable causes have enough evidence.|$|E
50|$|If {{the yellow}} light in signal 24 fails, the signal {{displays}} a higher <b>speed</b> <b>indication,</b> {{which would be}} a wrong-side failure. To prevent this, a current transformer in the lamp circuit monitors the current through the yellow lamp. If the yellow lamp fails, a relay will also switch off the green light and the signal becomes totally dark. A capacitor in the relay circuit ensures that the relay operation is a couple of seconds delayed, to prevent the relay operating for every blink. Hence, if the yellow lamp do suddenly fail, the green light will blink alone 1-2 times before it is switched off by the relay. Note: The animated picture of signal 24 is wrongly giving the impression that the yellow light is show before the green one. This is not correct: The yellow and green light is always switched on and off simultaneously, for every blink/flash.|$|E
40|$|Since {{gravity waves}} {{significantly}} influence the atmosphere by transporting energy and momentum, {{it is important}} to study their wave spectrum and their energy dissipation rates. Besides that, knowledge about gravity wave sources and the propagation of the generated waves is essential. Originating in the lower atmosphere, gravity waves can move upwards; when the background wind field is equal to their phase speed a so-called critical layer is reached. Their breakdown and deposition of energy and momentum is possible. Another mechanism which can take place at critical layers is gravity wave reflection. In this paper gravity waves which were observed by foil chaff measurements during the DYANA campaign (DYnamics Adapted Network for the Atmosphere) in 1990 in Biscarrosse (44 °N, 1 °W) —as reported by Wüst and Bittner [2006. Non-linear wave-wave interaction: case studies based on rocket data and first application to satellite data. Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics 68, 959 - 976]—are investigated to look for gravity wave reflection processes. Following nonlinear theory, energy dissipation rates according to Weinstock [1980. Energy dissipation rates of turbulence in the stable free atmosphere. Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences 38, 880 - 883] are calculated from foil chaff cloud and falling sphere data and compared to the critical layer heights. Enhanced energy dissipation rates are found at those altitudes where the waves’ phase speed matches the zonal background wind <b>speeds.</b> <b>Indication</b> of gravity wave trapping is found between two altitudes of around 95 km and 86 km. ...|$|R

5000|$|Digital visual altimeters, {{mounted on}} the wrist or hand. This type always {{operates}} electronically, and conveys the altitude as a number, rather than a pointer on a dial. Since these altimeters already contain all the electronic circuitry necessary for altitude calculation, they are commonly equipped with auxiliary functions such as electronic logbook, real-time jump profile replay, <b>speed</b> <b>indication,</b> simulator mode for use in ground training, etc. An electronic altimeter is activated on the ground before the jump, and calibrates automatically to point to 0. It is thus essential that the user not turn it on earlier than necessary to avoid, for example, the drive to a dropzone located at a different altitude than one's home which could cause a potentially fatal false reading. If the intended landing zone is at a different elevation than the takeoff point, the user needs to input the appropriate offset by using a designated function.|$|E

50|$|Allegro barbaro was {{composed}} in 1911, {{but the first}} performance didn't occur until 1921. to Maurice Hinson, editor, Bartók premiered the piece in February 1913 in Kecskemet, Hungary.

The piece was performed in private by Bartók many times by memory before he even started to notate the music. In many early printed versions of the composition, the tempo markings were indicated at a much slower <b>speed.</b> These <b>indications</b> would confuse musicians because the recordings of Bartók performing his own composition was much faster than indicated.

40|$|Abstract — As for the Indian road {{transport}} scenario is concerned, accidents {{are becoming a}} day to day cause an attempt {{has been made in}} this project to reduce such mishaps. In our project a high <b>speed</b> <b>indication</b> is given and automatic braking is applied by cutting off the fuel supply to the engine when the setup speed is exceeded. In our project, we have used solenoid valve and an operational amplifier circuit using LM 324 IC. The alternations to be made to implement this project in the vehicles are also discussed. more and more road accidents due to increased traffic on the roads, and if you see the statistics, you will find that the casualties are more every year than that of 1970 Indo-Pak war. Experts say, increased motorist population, long working hours, stressful life, are the major cause. The factors are beyond one’s control, but if we could alert the driver on the highway, could save the many prestigious lives. The fig. 1 shows the receiver block diagram...|$|E
5000|$|The {{frequency}} {{picked up}} by the transceiver is sent to the driver's cab. In the cab, a light signal is activated and sometimes play a sound that indicates the status of the signal. The train driver must press and release a button within 3 seconds to acknowledge the signal. Trains passing a signal at [...] "Caution" [...] will receive a <b>speed</b> control <b>indication</b> requiring the train to reduce speed until it passes the 300 meter beacon at which point it will be required to reduce speed further or be released to proceed at normal speed. If power is lost the beacon defaults to the most restrictive condition. If the signal indicates any reduction in speed, the train must slow down to the required speed limit in time, otherwise the emergency brakes are automatically applied. The emergency braking occurs when a train passes a signal at danger or if a previous beacon signal indicates a stop at the next signal and the speed at which the train is travelling is more than that required to stop the train.|$|R
50|$|There {{are simple}} yellow light shunt signals on signal posts which authorize {{movements}} {{to the next}} obstruction (vehicle) or signal. An accident occurred at Hines Hill in 1996 where a train entered the mainline from the East at high speed on a slow <b>speed</b> shunt signal <b>indication</b> and due to the driver not maintaining control of the train it collided with an Eastbound Westrail (see Hines Hill train collision) freight train after it had passed Departure Signal at Danger. The driver of the National Rail train had not reduced the speed of his train and the train controller unusually called the slow speed shunt signal, not meant for mainline operations.|$|R
30|$|The {{temporal}} variation of speed {{at a fixed}} location represents the stability of speeds between vehicles in a traffic stream. Low variation of <b>speed</b> is an <b>indication</b> of smooth traffic flow in which vehicles are traveling at nearly constant speeds. An increase in this speed variation indicates more variability in the speed choice among drivers. This in turn requires drivers to adjust speeds more frequently, leading to the deterioration of flow stability and {{a higher risk of}} driver error and an impending crash situation. The {{temporal variation}} of speed is measured by the coefficient of variation of speed (precursor CVS), calculated at the nearest detector station upstream of a crash location. CVS is a measure of dispersion which normalizes the standard deviation and is explained in more detail by Lee et al. [13].|$|R
