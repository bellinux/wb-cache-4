This study provides a unique picture of the range and prevalence of standardized scales used within Old Age Psychiatry Services in England and Northern Ireland, reported by 73 % of old age psychiatrists. Most services (64 %) used three or more standardized assessment scales (range 1 - 12). Sixty-two separate instruments were identified. The six most used measures were the Mini Mental State Examination (95 %), the Geriatric Depression Scale (52 %) and the Clock Drawing (50 %), the Clifton <b>Assessment</b> <b>Procedures</b> for the elderly (26 %), the Barthel Index (18 %) and the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales (HoNOS) 65 + (18 %). A number of factors were associated with greater use of certain standardized assessment scales. Shared documentation, along with other indicators of integration between health and social care were associated with greater use of standardized scales. The provision of a memory clinic was associated with greater use of neuropsychiatric scales {{and lower levels of}} use of cognitive scales.

40|$|LOOP is {{a concept}} to {{evaluate}} corroded or damaged pipelines based on detailed data from UT-pigging. The procedure of LOOP delivers a 3 D-model generated from the data of a commercial in-line inspection tools (ultrasonic, magnetic flux). This {{makes it possible to}} use the full functionalities of the relevant finite element software like evaluation of wall-thinning (LOOP 1) and fracture mechanics analysis to evaluate cracks in the wall (LOOP 2). In this paper is given the basic ideas of the LOOP concept, where the main focus is directed to the LOOP 1 <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure.</b> Based on a real example of a corroded pipeline is demonstrated the <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure,</b> which is based on an elastic-plastic analysis of a real inner contour of the corroded surface transferred in the finite element geometry model. The unique element is that the surface data of the UT-pigging is used directly to generate the geometry model in the FE-software ANSYS. The <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure</b> is validated by a burst pressure test of a corroded pipeline. The result of the burst pressure test is compared with the calculated limit load from an elastic-plastic analysis based on measured material properties. Additionally, the <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure</b> is compared with the results of a limit load analysis based on DIN EN 13445 - 3 and with the results of the standard <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure.</b> At the end the <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure</b> is compared with the procedure given in API 579 - 1 standard...|$|R

This study sought to investigate the validity of current <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures</b> in Professional Studies. Results of the study revealed historical influences upon <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures</b> at Mkoba. Over the years assessment has been by way of two course work assignments in Syllabus B, an end-of-year examination in Syllabus A, and a research of limited scope. The study tended to indicate the need to amplify the scope of <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures</b> beyond the two course work assignments, the end-of-year examination and the research of limited scope.

40|$|The {{literature}} {{indicates that}} teacher {{professional development and}} learning may be improved by using formative <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures.</b> This thesis focuses on a specific form of formative assessment, negotiated assessment, which is characterised by the exchange of views between assessor and assessee and the extensive involvement of the participants (assessees) in their own <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure.</b> The participants negotiate with their assessor about several aspects of the negotiated <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure.</b> Assumptions in negotiated teacher assessment are that the opportunities for negotiation might promote {{the development of a}} sense of agency in terms of teachers feeling in control of their learning and assessment processes and feeling able to pursue their learning objectives. This thesis covers four studies in which different aspects of negotiated assessment were examined. Its aim was to gain more knowledge about a negotiated <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure</b> to promote teacher learning in the area of stimulating students’ reflections. The results show that very little negotiation took place during the dialogues. Despite the lack of negotiation during the assessment meetings, the teachers reported a strong sense of agency. Overall, the teachers’ opinions indicated that the elements of the negotiated <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure</b> facilitated their professional learning. The contribution was particularly seen in change in their knowledge, beliefs, attitudes and practice.

40|$|Abstract: The next {{generation}} seismic design and <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures</b> for buildings within the performancebased framework are {{a radical departure}} from traditional seismic design practice and performance assessment. The uncertainty and randomness in the building performance and seismic hazard will be captured and quantified in each steps in design and <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure,</b> finally the performance will be measured in terms of direct and indirect economic losses and casualties. The quantification and propagation of uncertainty in every step in the procedure requires robust probabilistic methods that have been developed over the last two decades. This paper summarises the research undertaken to develop the probabilistic performance-based seismic design and <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures</b> for buildings. The analysis methods, fragility functions and seismic hazard qualification, which are key elements in procedures, are defined and discussed...|$|R

We conclude by suggesting that our theory of technique approach, which focuses on studying how the choices made in research implementation influence the study findings, should be extended to include the impact of ethics <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures.</b> © 2010 Taylor & Francis...|$|R
40|$|Project (Ed. S., School Psychology) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2012 Recent {{studies suggest}} that current {{perceptions}} regarding the validity of typical procedures utilized in functional behavior assessment may be inaccurate. In particular, descriptive <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures</b> appear to be heavily biased toward indicating a maintaining contingency of attention, and {{have been shown to}} have less validity than indirect measures such as the Functional Analysis Screening Tool. Given these findings, school personnel responsible for conducting functional behavior assessments should have access to alternative <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures</b> with improved validity. Experimental functional analyses offer one method that may be acceptable; this project seeks to develop a presentation that will provide participants with training in several alternative <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures</b> based on the experimental model for accurate identification of behavioral function through systematic manipulation of environmental variables.

40|$|The correct {{evaluation}} of seismic {{vulnerability of the}} existing building stock is a key issue for every earthquake prone Country; the need for reliable decision making tools for the assessment and retrofitting of the existing building stock is widely recognized. Still, the applicability, effectiveness, accuracy of currently codified seismic <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures</b> strongly vary, depending on {{the features of the}} assessed structures, and often also on the engineering judgement and knowledge of the applicator. Moreover, time and costs constraints, to which the <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures</b> are necessarily bound, pose further issues as to the details and immediateness of the implementation of such analyses. In the paper, a critical review of the most widespread currently codified seismic <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures</b> is carried out, with reference to the case study of a plan-wise irregular r. c. frame structure which underwent extensive pseudodynamic testing, both in the ¿as-built¿ and in retrofitted configurations, in the framework of the activity of the ELSA Laboratory of the JRC.
