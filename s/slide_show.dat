5|$|Producer Laurie David saw Gore's <b>slide</b> <b>show</b> in New York City at {{a global}} warming town-hall meeting after the May 27, 2004 premiere of The Day After Tomorrow. Gore {{was one of}} several panelists and he showed a ten-minute version of his <b>slide</b> <b>show.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{his defeat}} in the 2000 presidential {{election}} by George W. Bush, Gore returned his focus to the topic. He edited and adapted a <b>slide</b> <b>show</b> he had compiled years earlier, and began featuring the <b>slide</b> <b>show</b> in presentations on global warming across the U.S. and around the world. At {{the time of the}} film, Gore estimated he had shown the presentation more than one thousand times.|$|E
5|$|An Inconvenient Truth is a 2006 American {{documentary}} film directed by Davis Guggenheim about former United States Vice President Al Gore's campaign to educate citizens {{about global warming}} via a comprehensive <b>slide</b> <b>show</b> that, by his own estimate made in the film, he has given {{more than a thousand}} times. The idea to document his efforts came from producer Laurie David, who saw his presentation at a town-hall meeting on global warming, which coincided with the opening of The Day After Tomorrow. Laurie David was so inspired by Gore's <b>slide</b> <b>show</b> that she, with producer Lawrence Bender, met with Guggenheim to adapt the presentation into a film.|$|E

5|$|Gore {{then begins}} his <b>slide</b> <b>show</b> on Global Warming; a {{comprehensive}} presentation replete with detailed graphs, flow charts and stark visuals. Gore shows off several {{photographs of the}} Earth taken from multiple space missions, as Earthrise and The Blue Marble. Gore notes that these photos dramatically transformed {{the way we see}} the Earth, helping spark modern environmentalism.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{detailed}} wind tunnel tests Wilbur traveled to Chicago at Chanute's invitation {{to give a}} lecture to the Western Society of Engineers on September 18, 1901. He presented a thorough report about the 1900–01 glider experiments and complemented his talk with a lantern <b>slide</b> <b>show</b> of photographs. Wilbur's speech was the first public account of the brothers' experiments. A report {{was published in the}} Journal of the society, which was then separately published as an offprint titled Some Aeronautical Experiments in a 300 copy edition.|$|E

25|$|Although {{photographic}} color {{prints of}} the images were difficult to make {{at the time and}} <b>slide</b> <b>show</b> lectures consumed much of the time Prokudin-Gorsky used to demonstrate his work, photomechanical color prints of some were published in journals and books, and his studio issued some, most notably the Tolstoy portrait, as postcards and large photogravures. Many of the original prints published by his studio still survive.|$|E
25|$|Adams {{was also}} an {{environmental}} activist who campaigned on behalf of endangered species. This activism included {{the production of the}} non-fiction radio series Last Chance to See, in which he and naturalist Mark Carwardine visited rare species such as the kakapo and baiji, and the publication of a tie-in book of the same name. In 1992 this was made into a CD-ROM combination of audiobook, e-book and picture <b>slide</b> <b>show.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Mission {{entered a}} long period of gradual decline after Mexican {{secularization}} act of 1833. Though numerous restoration efforts in the intervening periods have reconstructed many of the original structures. The old mission church remains in use as a chapel of Saint Joseph Catholic Church, a parish of the Diocese of Oakland.

25|$|Haskins {{developed}} a medium format <b>slide</b> <b>show</b> comprising up to 500 images, each displayed for seven seconds, synchronised to music. These were shown {{with a traditional}} manual projector operated by Haskins using a darkroom timer. First shown in Brighton at an international photo conference in 1970, the show was hugely popular, filling theatres, cinemas and convention halls at photo conferences and public performances in over 50 cities around the world.|$|E
25|$|After a <b>slide</b> <b>show</b> on February 19, 1936, of {{his trip}} to Bohuslän, a region in southwestern Sweden, Wirth {{convinced}} Himmler to launch an expedition to the region, the first official expedition financed by the Ahnenerbe. Bohuslän was known for its massive quantity of petroglyph rock carvings, which Wirth believed were evidence of an ancient writing system predating all known systems. Himmler appointed Wolfram Sievers to be the {{managing director of the}} expedition, likely because of Wirth’s earlier troubles balancing finances.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} {{descriptive}} passages, like {{the description of}} the palaces of Neptune and the Samorim of Calicute, the locus amoenus of the Island of Love (Canto IX), the dinner in the palace of Thetis (Canto X), and Gama's cloth (end of Canto II). Sometimes these descriptions are like a <b>slide</b> <b>show,</b> in which someone shows each of the things described there; examples include the geographic start of Gama's speech to the king of Melinde, certain sculptures of the palaces of Neptune and the Samorim, the speech of Paulo da Gama to the Catual, and the Machine of the World (Máquina do Mundo).|$|E

25|$|Windows Sidebar {{is a new}} panel {{which can}} be placed on either the left or the {{right-hand}} side of the screen where a user can place Desktop Gadgets, which are small applets designed for a specialized purpose (such as displaying the weather or sports scores). The gadgets can also be placed on other parts of the desktop, if desired, by dragging. By default, Windows Vista ships with 11 gadgets: Calendar, Clock, Contacts, CPU Meter, Currency Conversion, Feed Headlines, Notes, Picture Puzzle, <b>Slide</b> <b>Show,</b> Stocks, and Weather. Additional gadgets were published at Microsoft's web site, which offered both Microsoft-created and user-submitted gadgets in a gallery. This feature was removed for security reasons.|$|E
25|$|The group's {{earliest}} educational {{efforts were}} {{a series of}} slide shows of hardcore and softcore pornography, which were shown with critical commentary by a WAP presenter. The format of a <b>slide</b> <b>show</b> with critical commentary had been used earlier by Julia London of the Los Angeles group Women Against Violence Against Women to illustrate soft-core pornographic themes in rock album covers; WAP adapted the format to discuss pornography in general, including hardcore pornography. Slide shows were generally organized by local feminist groups, and held in women's homes as part of consciousness-raising meetings. The anti-pornography movement has continued to use slide shows as an educational tactic for feminist group meetings and public events.|$|E
25|$|Glover {{has written}} between 15 and 20 books. Oak-Mot and Rat Catching are {{featured}} prominently during his Big <b>Slide</b> <b>Show</b> presentation, and {{are presented as}} visual art as much as written art. He constructs the books by reusing old novels and other publications which have fallen into the public domain due to their age (for example, Rat Catching was constructed from an 1896 book Studies in the Art of Rat Catching, and Oak-Mot was constructed from an 1868 novel of the same title). He rearranges text, blacks out certain standing passages, and adds his own prose (and sometimes images) into the margins and elsewhere, thus creating an entirely new story. Four of his books have been published so far, through his publishing company, Volcanic Eruptions. Other known titles include The Backward Swing, A New World, and Round My House.|$|E
