50|$|Baltimore {{remained}} peaceful {{into the}} day on April 6. Three hundred people gathered peacefully around noon for a memorial service, which lasted until 2 pm without incident. Street traffic began to increase. A crowd formed on Gay St. in East Baltimore, and by 5 pm some windows on the 400 block had been smashed. Police began to move in. People began to report fires after 6 pm. Soon after, the city declared a 10 pm curfew and called in 6,000 troops from the national guard. Sales of alcohol and firearms were immediately banned. At this point, some reports described about a thousand people in the crowd, which moved north on Gay <b>St.</b> <b>up</b> to Harford Rd. and Greenmount Ave. Mayor Thomas L. J. D'Alesandro III was unable to respond effectively. Around 8 pm, Governor Agnew {{declared a state of}} emergency.|$|E
5000|$|Besides biodegradibility, low toxicity, {{and high}} {{production}} potential, sophorolipids {{also have a}} high surface and interfacial activity compared to many chemically synthesized surfactants. These properties help justify the higher costs of production and purification associated with large scale production. Generally a surfactant is considered as a good surfactant if it can lower surface tension (ST) of water from 72 to 30-35 mN/m and the interfacial tension (IT) water/hexadecane from 40 to 1 mN/m. Sophorolipids are reported to reduce <b>ST</b> <b>up</b> to 29 mN/m and IT to 5 mN/m, at the much lower concentrations than the critical micelle concentration(CMC) {{of many of the}} synthetic surfactants. [...] In addition to this, sophorolipids are reported to function under wide ranges of temperatures, pressures and ionic strengths; and they also possess a number of other useful biological activities including Antimicrobial, virucidal, Anticancer, Immuno-modulatory properties.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Comparative data on {{long-term}} {{safety and efficacy}} of bioresorbable-polymer-BES versus durable-polymer-EES/ZES in ACS setting have hitherto been lacking. We sought to assess the safety and efficacy of bioresorbable-polymer-biolimus-A 9 -eluting stents (BES) compared with thin-strut-durable-polymer-everolimus- and zotarolimus-eluting stents (EES/ZES) in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) undergoing PCI. METHODS AND RESULTS: Between 2007 and 2012, 1, 547 patients were implanted with new-generation drug-eluting stents (DES). Out of these, 369 received BES and 1, 178 EES/ZES. The primary endpoint was probable/definite stent thrombosis (ST) while the secondary endpoint was a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction (MI), target vessel revascularization (TVR) and definite <b>ST</b> <b>up</b> to 5 years. As stent assignment was not random, we performed a propensity score matching (PSM), with 1 : 3 ratio, to account for potential confounders.
