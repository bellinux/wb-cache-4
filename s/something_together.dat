With three parrots, one parrot usually prefers to cooperate {{with one of the}} other two, but all of them are cooperating to solve the task.|$|E
25|$|Point of Grace {{was formed}} at Ouachita Baptist University in Arkadelphia, Arkansas. Denise Masters, Terry Lang and Heather Floyd, who {{knew each other}} from Norman, Oklahoma, coincidentally found {{themselves}} at OBU, and got involved in music. They sang in a vocal group called 'The Ouachitones,' which {{was made up of}} 14 girls. Within the group, the girls formed a trio, and after a sound check for an Ouachitones performance, the girls were singing a cappella when they were told by an onlooker that they should do <b>something</b> <b>together.</b> Shelley Phillips had come from Little Rock, Arkansas to OBU with a scholarship in vocal performance. She sang in a group called the Praise Singers, made up of four girls and four guys and they traveled around the country performing concerts. She became friends with Terry and Heather through Denise, who was her roommate and sister in the social club Chi Delta. After Heather, Terry and Denise made plans to form a trio and sing together over the summer, Denise went back to her dorm room and told Shelley about their summer plans. After Shelley suggested that the trio became a quartet, it seemed to be the perfect fit.|$|E
500|$|In 1971, he {{released}} another well-received album, Tupelo Honey. This album produced the hit single [...] "Wild Night" [...] {{that was later}} covered by John Mellencamp. The title song has a notably country-soul feel about it and the album ended with another country tune, [...] "Moonshine Whiskey". Morrison said he originally intended to make an all country album. The recordings were as live as possible – after rehearsing the songs the musicians would enter the studio and play a whole set in one take. His co-producer, Ted Templeman, described this recording process as the [...] "scariest thing I've ever seen. When he's got <b>something</b> <b>together,</b> he wants to put it down right away with no overdubbing." ...|$|E

500|$|The vocals on {{the album}} were always live after rehearsing each song five or six times, {{according}} to saxophonist and flautist [...] "Boots" [...] Houston, who further commented that when Morrison and the band went into the studio: [...] "we would then just play a whole set straight through without repeating anything. [...] We would have played maybe twenty songs and Van would go back and cut out the songs he didn't want. The only time we'd go back would be to overdub backing vocals or horns." [...] Ted Templeman remarked {{that he had to}} go through three engineers during the recording of the album, due to Morrison's [...] "ability as a musician, arranger and producer": [...] "When he's got <b>something</b> <b>together,</b> he wants to put it down right away with no overdubbing ... I've had to change engineers who couldn't keep up with him." ...|$|E
500|$|Initially, Seltmann and Chater {{were not}} {{planning}} {{for an international}} release. They were not concerned with copyright restrictions and so did not keep a list of which tracks were being sampled. According to Chater they [...] "were really unorganised and were just sampling on the fly as tracks progressed... We had no idea the record would get such a wide-scale release so we saw no need {{to keep track of}} what we were using – we were definitely guilty of harbouring a 'No-one's going to listen to it anyway' sort of attitude." [...] The sources spanned many different styles of music and sampled artists include: Françoise Hardy, Blowfly, Sérgio Mendes, Raekwon, Wayne and Shuster and Madonna. Seltmann felt that [...] "he more rejected and unwanted the record that a sample comes from, the more appealing it is, I guess it's almost a reaction to rare record finding, but occasionally things like 'Holiday' come up". He described how making sample tapes for each other created some samples which were intended as [...] "funny samples" [...] that they had no original intention to get clearance for. In particular, Madonna's song [...] "'Holiday' was one of those where we put <b>something</b> <b>together,</b> ended it with 'Holiday' and all had a big laugh. It ended up where we couldn't live without it so I guess we just had to make that one work". Later, Seltmann and Chater had a few problems when trying to clear all the samples. One sample that had to be removed was from Rodgers and Hammerstein in the intro that featured harps and girls singing. After checking clearances, [...] "he album is slightly different to its original form in that it had a whole new introduction, which apparently was really recognisable, so we had to take that off straight away". The group played their songs to flatmates to get input on which tracks were worth including on the album. [...] "Electricity" [...] was the first song the group felt that worked; it was a last-minute addition to the album as the Avalanches felt the song [...] "still sounds good". In early 2000, Seltmann (as Dazzler) and Chater (as Bobby C) finished production on the album, using the pseudonym Bobbydazzler. It had received the official title, Since I Left You in March 2000.|$|E

2500|$|While {{composing}} for symphonic ensembles, Glass also composed {{music for}} piano, with {{the cycle of}} five movements titled Metamorphosis (adapted from music for a theatrical adaptation of Franz Kafka's The Metamorphosis, and for the Errol Morris film The Thin Blue Line, 1988). In the same year Glass met the poet Allen Ginsberg by chance in a book store in the East Village of New York City, and they immediately [...] "decided on the spot to do <b>something</b> <b>together,</b> reached for one of Allen's books and chose Wichita Vortex Sutra", a piece for reciter and piano which in turn developed into a music theatre piece for singers and ensemble, Hydrogen Jukebox (1990).|$|E

She has a really big instrument. I thought {{we had to do}} <b>something</b> <b>together</b> that works. ‘Candle: Coventry Carol’ in itself is an ancient song, and I thought it would lend itself to that. And then Tash was thinking she wanted to do a bawdy song. And I said no. She wanted to do a bawdy British schoolboy read on a carol. And I said, “no, we’re not doing that, we’re not shocking grandma”. I came up with this idea of ‘Holly, Ivy and Rose’ and she really took to that idea. So in the end both of them are there. And I thought that was important because we all sing together." ...|$|E
2500|$|With {{production}} by Wilson, the Beach Boys covered Bacharach's [...] "My Little Red Book" [...] and [...] "Walk On By" [...] in 1967 and 1968 but left the recordings unreleased. Wilson {{has said that}} Bacharach was a direct influence on his [...] "She Knows Me Too Well", [...] "Let's Go Away for Awhile", and [...] "Love and Mercy". Writers have variously attributed Bacharach influence on Wilson's [...] "Guess I'm Dumb", [...] "Let Him Run Wild, and [...] "The Little Girl I Once Knew". Discussing [...] "Let's Go Away", Wilson said: [...] "there {{were a lot of}} chord changes similar to the way he would put <b>something</b> <b>together.</b> And I think that his music had such a profound thing on my head; he got me going in a direction." [...] He mentions [...] "minor seventh chords" [...] as a specific point of influence.|$|E

2500|$|Yorke wrote many of Kid As lyrics {{by cutting}} up {{words and phrases}} and {{assembling}} them at random. Many were everyday cliches and banal observations, such as [...] "Where'd you park the car?"; others are violent ("cut the kids in half"). The chorus lyric of [...] "How to Disappear Completely" [...] was inspired by Yorke's friend Michael Stipe of R.E.M., who advised Yorke to relieve tour stress by repeating to himself: [...] "I'm not here, this isn't happening". Another line came from a dream Yorke had {{in which he was}} running down the River Liffey. The chorus lyric of [...] "Optimistic" [...] ("try the best you can / the best you can is good enough") was an assurance by Yorke's partner, Rachel Owen, when he felt that [...] "nothing we'd done was releasable". Radiohead used Yorke's lyrics [...] "like pieces in a collage, pierced <b>something</b> <b>together</b> and [...] an artwork out of a lot of different little things". They did not publish Kid As lyrics in the liner notes, as they felt they could not be considered independently of the music.|$|E
2500|$|Rhett and Link met in 1984 on September 4th (this is {{the exact}} date they started school in Harnett County) at Buies Creek Elementary School in Buies Creek, North Carolina, where they {{attended}} first grade, a meeting about which they have subsequently written a song and made a movie (Looking For Ms. Locklear - 2008). [...] They met through having to stay in at recess, as they were both doodling on their desks. In an interview on The Tonight Show, they state that they stayed in during recess because {{both of them had}} written swear words on their desks. They stayed in and colored in mythical creatures such as a unicorn (hence their YouTube channel name, GMM/Good Mythical Morning) In their freshman year of high school at Harnett Central High School in Angier, North Carolina, both Rhett and Link signed a blood oath {{on a piece of paper}} which said, [...] "We will do <b>something</b> <b>together</b> some day".

2500|$|NME {{considered}} it a [...] "comeback single" [...] for the [...] "pop queen". CNN called it a [...] "pleasing single", also labeled [...] "peppy, radio-perfect" [...] and [...] "funky fun". Entertainment Weekly {{considered it}} [...] "competent hack-pop", and Newsday declared the song [...] "breathy" [...] and [...] "carefree". The former publication also exclaimed the song [...] "delivers", adding it [...] "slides nicely from a half-time, stutter-beat verse to a memorably singsongy chorus, on which Janet's restrained cooing lets the melody do all the work." [...] In a later anecdote, it was described as [...] "Bacharachian" [...] as well as [...] "peppy" [...] and [...] "cute", commending its [...] "bells and whistles in the production" [...] and Jackson's [...] "falsetto trill". MTV News labeled it [...] "a return to Jackson's more melodic, pop side and {{a departure from the}} more groove-based The Velvet Rope." [...] Vibe called it [...] "blissful" [...] with a [...] "bright, shiny sound", and MacKenzie Wilson of AllMusic considered it [...] "sweet upbeat" [...] and a large contrast from other songs on the film's soundtrack. It was also considered [...] "a less suffocating shade of pop" [...] for radio, both [...] "blippy" [...] and [...] "joyful". Film magazine Empire called it [...] "soulful hip-pop" [...] and [...] "popcorn for the ears", likened to [...] "vodka on the rocks" [...] for its [...] "Pepsi commercial" [...] semblance. Furthermore, Jeff Stark of Salon declared it as [...] "skittery" [...] and [...] "subdued", and Slant Magazine described it as laced with [...] "minimal percussive programming". Elsewhere, the song was examined to have a [...] "catchy hook" [...] and [...] "the quality to get stuck in your head", commending Jackson for continuously possessing the ability to [...] "get <b>something</b> <b>together</b> that can get your hip in motion." ...|$|E
