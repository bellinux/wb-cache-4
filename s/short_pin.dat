40|$|For a probe-fed {{microstrip}} antenna, it {{is quite}} common to employ the cavity model to find the field distribution under the patch and other electrical properties. Therefore, a multiport analysis technique based on the cavity model is usually employed to predict the input impedance of a probe-fed microstrip antenna with <b>shorting</b> <b>pins.</b> However, this approach does not provide any information about the field distribution under the patch with the <b>shorting</b> <b>pins,</b> which is usually {{used to calculate the}} radiation properties of the patch antenna. In this study, <b>shorting</b> <b>pins</b> are considered as current sources with unknown amplitudes, and the field distribution under the patch is obtained as a linear superposition of the contributions from each source via cavity model. Then, the unknown current densities over the <b>shorting</b> <b>pins</b> are determined by implementing the boundary condition of the tangential electric field on the pins. This is a hybrid approach because the field distribution is calculated from the cavity model, and the current densities over the <b>shorting</b> <b>pins</b> are obtained from the point matching of the resulting field distributions over the shorting conductors. The input impedance results found from this approach agree extremely well with those obtained from the multiport analysis, which shows that the proposed approach predicts both the input impedance and the field distribution under the patch. In addition, since the feeding probe is also made of PEC, the electric field under the patch should satisfy the boundary condition on this conductor as well. In the application of the cavity model, this is always ignored, with the assumption that the source probe is too thin to affect the field distribution under the patch significantly. In this study, the boundary condition of the electric field is implemented over the source, and its effect on the field distribution, in turn on the resonant frequency, is demonstrated...|$|R

Numbers of added <b>shorting</b> <b>pins</b> and positions of these pins are changed in every step, systematically and different pin combinations are tried for three antennas that design parameters are present in literature. Later, optimal pin combinations that give the intended resonant frequencies and the largest bandwidths are determined. For these optimal combinations, by keeping the resonant frequencies constant, the bandwidths of the antennas are increased to % 1. 440, % 2. 780 and % 6. 024, respectively. Compared to measurement results in the literature, for bandwidths, significant improvements are obtained. At the same time, it is observed that the technique of <b>shorting</b> <b>pin</b> addition increases the bandwidths in higher percentages on thicker microstrip antennas.

40|$|The {{contention}} {{and treatment}} of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other bacteria that cause infectious diseases {{require the use of}} new type of antibiotics. Pandinin 2 (Pin 2) is a scorpion venom antimicrobial peptide highly hemolytic that has a central proline residue. This residue forms a structural "kink" linked to its pore-forming activity towards human erythrocytes. In this work, the residue Pro 14 of Pin 2 was both substituted and flanked using glycine residues (P 14 G and P 14 GPG) based on the low hemolytic activities of antimicrobial peptides with structural motifs Gly and GlyProGly such as magainin 2 and ponericin G 1, respectively. The two Pin 2 variants showed antimicrobial activity against E. coli, S. aureus, and M. tuberculosis. However, Pin 2 [GPG] was less hemolytic (30 %) than that of Pin 2 [G] variant. In addition, based on the primary structure of Pin 2 [G] and Pin 2 [GPG], two short peptide variants were designed and chemically synthesized keeping attention to their physicochemical properties such as hydrophobicity and propensity to adopt alpha-helical conformations. The aim to design these two short antimicrobial peptides was to avoid the drawback cost associated to the synthesis of peptides with large sequences. The <b>short</b> <b>Pin</b> 2 variants named Pin 2 [14] and Pin 2 [17] showed antibiotic activity against E. coli and M. tuberculosis. Besides, Pin 2 [14] presented only 25 % of hemolysis toward human erythrocytes at concentrations as high as 100 µM, while the peptide Pin 2 [17] did not show any hemolytic effect at the same concentration. Furthermore, these short antimicrobial peptides had better activity at molar concentrations against multidrug resistance M. tuberculosis than that of the conventional antibiotics ethambutol, isoniazid and rifampicin. Therefore, Pin 2 [14] and Pin 2 [17] have the potential to be used as an alternative antibiotics and anti-tuberculosis agents with reduced hemolytic effects...|$|E

40|$|A {{new class}} of dual mode {{microstrip}} fractal resonator is proposed and developed for miniaturization of the dual band bandpass filter. The perimeter of the proposed resonator is increased by employing fourth iteration T-square fractal shape. Consequently the lower resonant frequency of the filter is decreased without increasing the usable space. The self similarity of the usable structure enables it to produce the two degenerate modes which are coupled using the proper perturbation technique. The <b>shorting</b> <b>pin</b> is placed at the null in the surface current distribution {{at the center of}} the resonator. This <b>shorting</b> <b>pin</b> is coactively coupled to the resonant circuit of the resonator, effectively coupled to the lower degenerate mode and reduces the lower edge band resonant frequency. By adjusting the resonator dimensions and the size of the <b>shorting</b> <b>pin,</b> the resonant frequency and the out-of-band rejection around the transmission bands can be controlled to meet the design requirements. The simulated response of the designed filter has two transmission bands, the first band is from 2. 34 - 3. 65 GHz with resonant frequencies at 2. 47 GHz and 3. 55 GHz, the second band is from 4. 37 - 5. 324 GHz with resonant frequencies at 4. 5 GHz and 5. 13 GHz.
