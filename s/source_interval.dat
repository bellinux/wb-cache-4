40|$|AbstractAn {{interval}} bigraph is an undirected {{bipartite graph}} whose edge set is {{the intersection of}} the edge sets of an interval graph and the edge set of a complete bipartite graph on the same vertex set. A bipartite interval representation of an interval bigraph is given by a bipartitioned set of intervals for its vertices, such that vertices are adjacent if and only if the corresponding intervals intersect and belong to opposite sides of the bipartition. Interval digraphs are directed graphs defined by a closely related concept. Each vertex of an interval digraph is represented by two intervals on the real line, a <b>source</b> <b>interval</b> and a target interval. The directed arc (u,v) exists in the interval digraph if the <b>source</b> <b>interval</b> of u meets the target interval of v. We give a dynamic programming algorithm recognizing interval bigraphs (interval digraphs) in polynomial time. This algorithm recursively constructs a bipartite interval representation of a graph from bipartite interval representations of proper subgraphs. Moreover, we list some forbidden substructures of interval bigraphs...|$|E

30|$|The {{samples from}} Eocene shaly unit are {{excellent}} source rocks capable of generating hydrocarbon. The {{results of the}} modeling suggest that hydrocarbon generation from the Eocene source rocks in the Northern Delta depobelt occurred during the Paleogene–Neogene times. Regional maturity distribution and generation of oil from the Eocene <b>source</b> <b>interval</b> in the Northern Delta depobelt seems likely. Hydrocarbon generation started in the eastern and western flanks of the depobelt during Oligocene and Miocene, respectively. Short- to long-distance migration of the hydrocarbon generated from the source unit {{is expected to have}} occurred and must have charged the interbedded Eocene sand bodies and younger reservoir units; this fact corroborates production data of the wells, as sub-economical volumes of oil were recovered from the Eocene sand bodies. Possible hydrocarbon migration is expected along fault breakouts and unconformities to adjoining prolific reservoir rocks. The presence of hydrocarbon in the studied well suggests the viability of the Paleogene-sourced play in the Northern Delta depobelt. Hydrocarbon drilling activities in the Northern Delta depobelt should focus on identification of prolific reservoir sand bodies.|$|E

40|$|Fine-grained Palaeogene^early Neogene {{strata of}} the South Caspian basin, speci¢cally the Oligocene^Lower Miocene Maikop Series, are {{responsible}} for the bulk of hydrocarbon generation in the region. Despite the magnitude of oil and gas currently attributed to the <b>source</b> <b>interval</b> o¡shore, geochemical evaluation of 376 outcrop samples from the northern edge of the Kura basin (onshore eastern Azerbaijan) indicates that depositional conditions in these proximal strata along the basin margins were dominantly oxic to mildly suboxic/anoxic throughout three major depositional stages: the Palaeocene^Eocene, Oligocene^early Middle Miocene and late Middle^Late Miocene. Palaeocene^Eocene samples have low average total organic carbon (TOC) values (0. 3 %), with higher total inorganic carbon (TIC) values (average 5 2. 6 %), extremely low sulphur content (0. 2 %) and relatively high detrital input as indicated by Fe/Al and Ti/Al ratios. C^S^Fe associations, along with relatively lower concentrations of redox-sensitive trace elements (e. g.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{intended}} to clarify the depositional environment of a 180 -m-thick, immature, limy Middle Miocene oil source rock interval, cored in the Zala Basin, western Hungary. For this purpose, a highly interdisciplinary approach was applied combining simple, standard micropaleontological, isotopic, and organic geochemical methods, rarely applied together. Foraminifera were studied for estimating bottom oxygenation and water depth, while nannoplankton biostratigraphy permitted for estimating the rate of sedimentation. The studied source rocks were deposited in a rather shallow sea, below well-oxygenated bottom water. The abundant epiphytic foraminiferal fauna proves that the bottom was densely inhabited by benthic algae, while the high δ 13 C org (>– 22 ‰) clearly indicates massive benthic algal contribution to the kerogen. Mass accumulation rate of the limy {{upper part of the}} NN 5 nannoplankton biozone, the oil <b>source</b> <b>interval</b> included, was very high (551  t/m 2 /Ma). In spite of moderate productivity and good oxygenation of the bottom, rapid accumulation of carbonate, produced partly by benthic algae, assured both the great relative weight of the marine organic components and their good preservation. Our results provide the first proof for the possibility of a major contribution of benthic algae to oil-prone kerogen...|$|E
40|$|Many {{modulated}} signals {{exhibit a}} cyclostationarity property, {{which can be}} exploited in direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation to effectively eliminate interference and noise. In this paper, our aim is to integrate the cyclostationarity with the spatial domain and enable the algorithm to estimate more sources than sensors. However, DOA estimation with a sparse array is performed in the coarray domain and the holes within the coarray limit the usage of the complete coarray information. In order to use the complete coarray information to increase the degrees-of-freedom (DOFs), sparsity-aware-based methods and the difference coarray interpolation methods have been proposed. In this paper, the coarray interpolation technique is further explored with cyclostationary signals. Besides the difference coarray model and its corresponding Toeplitz completion formulation, we build up a sum coarray model and formulate a Hankel completion problem. In order to further improve {{the performance of the}} structured matrix completion, we define the spatial spectrum sampling operations and the derivative (conjugate) correlation subspaces, which can be exploited to construct orthogonal constraints for the autocorrelation vectors in the coarray interpolation problem. Prior knowledge of the <b>source</b> <b>interval</b> can also be incorporated into the problem.

40|$|A 3 -D surface {{seismic survey}} was {{conducted}} to explore {{the structure of the}} Rye Patch geothermal reservoir (Nevada), to determine if modern seismic techniques could be successfully applied in geothermal environments. Furthermore, it was intended to map the structural features which may control geothermal production in the reservoir. The seismic survey covered an area of 3. 03 square miles and was designed with 12 north-south receiver lines and 25 east-west source lines. The receiver group interval was 100 feet and the receiver line spacing was 800 feet. The <b>source</b> <b>interval</b> was 100 feet while the source line spacing was 400 feet. The sources were comprised of 4 vibrator trucks arranged in a box array. Seismic processing involved, among other steps, the picking of over 700, 000 of the possible one million traces to determine first arrival travel times, normal moveout correction, 3 -D stack, deconvolution, time migration, and depth conversion. The final data set represents a 3 -D cube of the subsurface structure in the reservoir. Additionally, the travel times were used to perform tomographic inversions for velocity estimates to support the findings of the surface seismic imaging. The results suggest the presence of at least one dominant fault responsible for the migration of fluids in the reservoir. Furthermore, it is suggested that this feature might be part of a fault system that includes a graben structure...|$|E

30|$|Hydrocarbon-producing {{lacustrine}} basins {{are widely}} {{developed in the}} world, and China has {{a large number of}} lacustrine basins that have developed since the early Permian. The organic-rich shale-dominated heterogeneous <b>source</b> rock <b>intervals</b> in Chinese lacustrine basins generally contain frequent thin interbeds of stratigraphically associated sandstone, siltstone, marl, dolomite, and limestone. The concept of “Hybrid Plays” as put forth in this article recognizes this pattern of alternating organic-rich shale and organic-lean interbeds and existence of mixed unconventional and conventional plays. Hybrid Plays in lacustrine <b>source</b> rock <b>intervals</b> present a unique closed petroleum system hosting continuous hydrocarbons. The interbedded organic-lean siliciclastic and/or carbonate plays are efficiently charged with hydrocarbons via short migration pathways from the adjacent organic-rich shale that is often also a self-sourced play. We assert “Hybrid Plays” provide the most realistic exploration model for targeting multiple-stacked and genetically related very tight shale, tight and conventional plays together in the entire <b>source</b> rock <b>interval</b> rather than individual plays only. The Hybrid Play model has been proven and works {{for a wide variety of}} lacustrine rift, sag and foreland basins in China.|$|R

The lack of systematic studies linking the organic-rich and organic-lean reservoirs inhibits {{a full understanding of}} the petroleum systems of the <b>source</b> rock <b>intervals.</b> Based on the geologic characteristics of lacustrine <b>source</b> rock <b>intervals</b> and successful oil production from the self-sourced organic-rich shale, e.g., Woodford shale and organic-lean low permeability carbonates, e.g., Niobrara and Bakken, we put forth the “Hybrid Plays” concept for multiple-stacked shale related plays (stratigraphically associated siliciclastic shale, siltstone, sandstone, and carbonate plays) within the lacustrine <b>source</b> rock <b>intervals.</b> The main objective {{of this study is to}} summarize the characteristics, distribution and production potential of “Hybrid Plays” of lacustrine source rocks using typical lacustrine basins in China as case studies.

This integrated approach will help to better characterize and understand the types of shale-related mixed resource plays and their potentials in the China lacustrine basins and stimulate further exploration and study of lacustrine basins all over the world.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Due to its easy applicability, {{pulse wave}} has been {{proposed}} as a surrogate of electrocardiogram (ECG) {{for the analysis of}} heart rate variability (HRV). However, its smoother waveform precludes accurate measurement of pulse-to-pulse interval by fiducial-point algorithms. Here we report a pulse frequency demodulation (PFDM) technique as a method for extracting instantaneous pulse rate function directly from pulse wave signal and its usefulness for assessing pulse rate variability (PRV). Methods Simulated pulse wave signals with known pulse interval functions and actual pulse wave signals obtained from 30 subjects with a trans-dermal pulse wave device were analyzed by PFDM. The results were compared with heart rate and HRV assessed from simultaneously recorded ECG. Results Analysis of simulated data revealed that the PFDM faithfully demodulates <b>source</b> <b>interval</b> function with preserving the frequency characteristics of the function, even when the intervals fluctuate rapidly over a wide range and when the signals include fluctuations in pulse height and baseline. Analysis of actual data revealed that individual means of low and high frequency components of PRV showed good agreement with those of HRV (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0. 997 and 0. 981, respectively). Conclusion The PFDM of pulse wave signal provides a reliable assessment of PRV. Given the popularity of pulse wave equipments, PFDM may open new ways to the studies of long-term assessment of cardiovascular variability and dynamics. </p...|$|E

The goal {{of this study is}} to characterize the pore systems of the Cretaceous Lincoln Limestone found in the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) Basin in order to test the hypothesis that lithologic variability has a control on pore characteristics and total porosity. The Lincoln Limestone represents a possible reservoir interval in close proximity to a <b>source</b> <b>interval,</b> the Hartland Shale, which directly overlies it, thus making it a potentially profitable future exploration target. Pore networks in the Lincoln were characterized using AR-milled rock surfaces run through a scanning electron microscope (SEM) for image capture, image analysis with Avizio 9 software, and mineralogical characterization by X-Ray fluorescence (XRF). Seven samples were chosen for analysis from a single core taken from one well in the DJ basin. Five of the samples span the roughly 70 - 90 ft thick Lincoln Limestone and the other two come from right above and right below the Lincoln. The seven samples span the range of lithologic and porosity variability in the Lincoln Limestone.

40|$|The University of Modena and Istituto Nazionale di Oceanografia e di Geofisica Sperimentale (OGS) collaborated {{to acquire}} two {{geophysical}} data set in two areas located near Sassuolo (Modena; Northen Appenines). The first area {{is characterized by}} fossil fluid expulsion structures forming in the Upper Miocene, while the second one is actually interested by expulsion of mud and free gas. We used seismic 3 D surveys to reconstruct in detail the shallow structures in both areas. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and geo-electrical survey are used only in the second area to better characterize the first meters. The fossil structures located in the first area (Sasso Strega) have a horizontal dimension of about 10 meters, and a vertical extension of few ten. To investigate {{the presence of these}} buried structures a 3 D seismic acquisition was performed, in which additional shots are located across the investigated area by using the natural topography to have the same effect of a deep source. In this way, the structures are lightened directly from the bottom. The source was the mini-bang and the receivers are vertical geophones (10 Hz). The receiver inline and cross-line intervals were 5 m, while the <b>source</b> <b>interval</b> was equal to 5 m (for inline shots) and 10 m (for cross-line shots). After the processing of the data to increase the signal/noise ratio, the tomographic inversion of the first breaks was applied to determine the geometry and the compressional velocity of buried structures. In the second site (near Nirano), a 3 D seismic acquisition was acquired using three component geophones. In this case, the source was a Vibroseis source, that generates both compressional and shear waves. So, the acquisition allowed us to obtain information about both compressional and shear velocity fields by using the inversion tomography of the first arrivals. Of course, the comparison between the two fields is an useful tool to investigate the fluid presence in the investigated area. In fact, {{it is well known that}} the compressional velocities are influenced by both matrix and fluid, while the shear velocities detect only the matrix change.

30|$|Based on the {{vertical}} Ma 7 well drilled and hydraulically fractured in 2004, the heterogeneous Lucaogou <b>source</b> rock <b>interval</b> is mainly composed of dolomitic mudstone, tuffaceous mudstone, and calcareous shale, {{making it a}} high-quality source rock with TOC content ranging from 1 % to 7 % and R o values from 0.5 % to 0.9 % (Fig.  4 b). This “Hybrid Play” produced oil from the <b>source</b> rock <b>interval</b> interbedded with dolomitic mudstone, tuffaceous mudstone, calcareous shale, and argillaceous limestone reservoirs {{at a rate of}} 22 tonnes (160 barrels)/day after hydraulic fracturing. For this Ma 7 well, the lower member of Lucaogou Fm. consisting of dolomitic mudstone and tuffaceous mudstone is interpreted mainly as a shale oil play and the upper member of the Lucaogou Fm. consisting of naturally fractured argillaceous limestone interbedded with thin, organic-rich calcareous mudstone is regarded mainly as a tight oil reservoir (Fig.  4 b). The regional well correlation shows that the lithofacies for the lower member of the Lucaogou Formation varies from calcareous sandstone, to argillaceous limestone, and dolomitic mudstone, and then to mudstone from the margin toward the central sag (Fig.  4 c). The multiple lithofacies, continuous and regional distribution of the Lucaogou <b>source</b> rock <b>interval</b> clearly place it in the “Hybrid Play” model. Many wells (e.g., Ma 58, Ma 1, Ma 6, Ma 7, Ma 8, Ma 19, Ma 21, Ma 24) confirm the “Hybrid Play” characteristics of the Lucaogou <b>source</b> rock <b>interval.</b> The recent horizontal well and multistage hydraulic fracturing further improved the production rates and increased the economic viability. The horizontal Ma 58 H well produced oil at a rate of 115 tonnes (839 barrels)/day (based on an average 24 -h test result) from a lateral of 804  m in a fractured section of the Lucaogou shale and argillaceous carbonate. Based on the drilling results, the oil is primarily produced from the tight argillaceous dolomite play with a second zone of production from the self-sourced Lucaogou dolomitic shale, calcareous shale, and limestone-rich shale/marl plays. The production {{is due in part to}} the brittle nature of the argillaceous dolomite allowing more efficient hydraulic fracturing. The marl, dolomitic shale, and calcareous shale are more ductile.|$|R

Recognizing {{the importance of}} many <b>source</b> rock <b>intervals</b> including the Lower Permian Fengcheng shales (Hu et al. 2015; Xiang et al. 2015), the Middle Permian Lucaogou and equivalent Pingdiquan Fm. are considered the most important <b>source</b> rock <b>intervals</b> due to wide distribution, large thickness, high TOC, and good hydrocarbon potential (Carroll 1998). The Lucaogou Fm. in the Junggar and Santanghu Basins spans {{a wide variety of}} depositional environments from shallow to deep hypersaline lake. The Lucaogou Fm. consists of silty dolomite, marl, dolomitic siltstone, dolomitic shale, and shale, which are of mixed siliciclastics and carbonate. The dolomitic shale and silty dolomite were deposited in areas of low clastic supply, either in central basin areas or at basin margins starved of clastic input. We use the Jimsar Depression in the Junggar Basin and the Malang Depression in the Santanghu Basin as representatives to characterize the Hybrid Plays of Middle Permian mixed siliciclastics and carbonate source rock.|$|R

Several other wells drilled in this area all produced shale gas at IP up to 8000  m 3 (280, 000  ft 3)/day from “Hybrid Plays” with adjacent beds of shale and tight sandstone. For the sand-dominant reservoirs within the organic-rich Chang 7 shale, most have thicknesses of 5 – 25  m, porosity of 4 %– 10 % and permeability less than 0.3 mD and are juxtaposed with the Chang 7 shale source rock. The sand-rich zones have been targeted for continuous accumulation of tight oil hydrocarbons. For example, in the Zhidan area in the central west Ordos Basin, tight oil production has been tested in the sandstone interbeds within the Yanchang 7 shale <b>source</b> rock <b>interval</b> with TOC content ranging from 3 % to 8 % in 127 wells. There are 29 wells with average oil production rates of 8.8 + tonnes (64 + barrels)/day. For the shale oil potential in the Ordos Basin, PetroChina Changqing Oilfield drilled and fractured the G 295 well and the test result showed this well produced oil at 20.4 tonnes (150 barrels)/day from the organic-rich Yanchang 7 (Chang 7) shale with a thickness of 28  m and some natural fractures. Hybrid fracturing has been used to target the hybrid hydrocarbon-bearing organic-rich shale and organic-lean sandstone reservoirs within Yanchang 7 (Chang 7) <b>source</b> rock <b>interval</b> (Zhou et al. 2012).|$|R
40|$|DE 102008056251 A 1 UPAB: 20100428 NOVELTY - The device has an {{optoelectronic}} sensor arrangement (1130) {{for detecting}} a vital parameter by light reflection at a finger. The arrangement has a light-sensitive element (1330), light sources (1310, 1320) for producing {{light in a}} visible wavelength range, and invisible wavelength range, respectively. A control device (1410) connects the latter light <b>source</b> at <b>intervals</b> of time, to use the received light in the invisible wavelength range to check whether a finger is resting on the arrangement, and to connect the former light source when the finger is resting on the arrangement. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for detecting a vital parameter. USE - Device for detecting a vital parameter e. g. pulse wave, pulse frequency, pulse-amplitude and oxygen saturation of blood (all claimed) of a driver of a motor vehicle. ADVANTAGE - The control device connects the light <b>source</b> at <b>intervals</b> of time, to use the received light in the invisible wavelength range to check whether the finger is resting on the arrangement, and to connect another light source when the finger is resting on the arrangement, thus avoiding disturbance of {{the driver of the}} vehicle during night time. The device is designed such that it reduces energy consumption of the sensor arrangement...|$|R
30|$|The {{source of}} the Ordovician oil {{reservoir}} in the Tabei Uplift of the Tarim Basin {{has long been a}} controversial issue, because the oils are of high thermal maturity and there are few wells of sufficient depth to penetrate the potential <b>source</b> rock <b>intervals</b> (Li et al. 2010 a, b; Chang et al. 2013 a). However, more and more studies have indicated that oils in the Tabei Uplift are sourced from Middle–Upper Ordovician carbonate source rocks (Zhang et al. 2000; Zhang and Huang 2005; Wang et al. 2008; Yu et al. 2011; Chang et al. 2013 a).|$|R
