50|$|To {{support the}} concept of a perceptual trap, Patten and Kelly cited a study of the lesser prairie chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus). The species' natural environment, shinnery oak grassland, is often treated with the {{herbicide}} tebuthiuron to increase grass cover for cattle grazing. Herbicide treatment resulted in less shrub cover, a habitat cue that caused female lesser prairie-chickens to avoid the habitat in favour of untreated areas. However, females who nested in herbicide-treated areas achieved comparable nesting successes and clutch sizes to those in untreated areas. Patten and Kelly suggest that the adverse effects of tebuthiuron treatment on nesting success are countered by various effects, such as greater nest concealment through increased grass cover. Therefore, female birds are erroneously avoiding a high-quality habitat. Patten and Kelly also cited as a possible perceptual trap the cases of the <b>spotted</b> <b>towhee</b> (Pipilo maculatus) and rufous-crowned sparrow (Aimophila ruficeps), which tend to avoid habitat fragments, even though birds nesting in habitat fragments achieve increased nesting success due to a reduction in snake predation.|$|E

30|$|The {{species that}} showed {{significant}} declines in low-elevation coastal sage scrub, {{such as the}} <b>spotted</b> <b>towhee,</b> wrentit, and bushtit, all generally prefer vegetation communities with high cover. The post-fire reduction in cover in the burned chaparral possibly led this vegetation type to appear and function similar to intact coastal sage scrub; the burned chaparral could now provide perches with high visibility and, therefore, lure in birds that typically use open scrubby areas. One species in our study, the <b>spotted</b> <b>towhee,</b> decreased in impacted coastal sage scrub, but increased in impacted chaparral. These vegetation communities often border each other, so it is reasonable that spotted towhees surviving the fire moved from impacted coastal sage scrub to impacted chaparral to satisfy their habitat requirements. Stanton (1986) also observed significantly fewer spotted towhees in burned coastal sage scrub.|$|E
40|$|Nest site {{choice of}} birds has the {{potential}} to affect predation rates on nests and reproductive success for many bird species, and is thus tied closely to fitness. Vegetation at a particular site influences concealment (and predation rate as a result). Research has shown that birds of various species base nest site choice on variables like nest height, and especially vegetation cover within the microhabitat around a site. I studied nest site choice in ground-nesting birds, which tend to experience high predation rates near the nest site, and therefore might be expected to be particular choosy about vegetation near the nest. I used <b>Spotted</b> <b>Towhees</b> (Pipilo maculatus) nesting in Lesser Park in Portland, OR, as a model species for ground-nesting birds. I compared <b>Spotted</b> <b>Towhees</b> nest sites (n = 15) to both randomly-chosen sites within 10 m of the nests (n = 15; random territory sites) and other randomly-chosen locations throughout the park (n = 25; random park locations) to test whether vegetation structure and floristic composition differed. I measured (1) vegetation height and density near the nest, (2) size and spacing of trees around nests, and (3) floristic composition of vegetation near nests. I found that nest sites and both categories of random sites had dense and equal amounts of vegetation near ground level (0 - 20 cm above ground), but that nest sites had more vegetation between 21 - 40 cm and 61 - 100 cm above ground than random locations. However, {{there was no evidence that}} the structure of the tree community or species composition differed between nest sites and random locations. Towhees thus appear to prefer to place nests in locations with greater vertical cover directly over the nest...|$|R
40|$|The extra-pair (EP) {{mating system}} of birds may be {{influenced}} by food resources, such that nutritionally stressed females are unable to pursue EP fertilizations (constrained female hypothesis; CFH), or that females on poor territories acquire EP fertilizations during extra-territorial forays in search of food (mating opportunity hypothesis; MOH). Edges of urban habitat fragments are sites of apparent high food abundance for <b>spotted</b> <b>towhees</b> Pipilo maculatus, and we used distance to habitat edge in four urban parks in Portland, OR, USA (2004 – 2006), to test the CFH and MOH. EP paternity was independent of park identity and year; 44 % of nests contained EP young and 26 % of all young were EP. As predicted by the CFH, EP paternity was more common in nests of long-tailed (presumably) high quality females. However, independently of tail length, younger females had more EP young than older females, a finding consistent with the MOH. Contrary to predictions of both hypotheses, the probability that a nest contained EP young was highest both at the habitat edge and habitat interior while the proportion of young in nests of EP origin (for nests with EP young) was highest at intermediate distances from habitat edge. We propose that high frequency of EP paternity among females in the interior occurred because, as predicted by the MOH, they ranged more widely in search of food and often encountered EP males. High probability of EP paternity near edges was likely unrelated to female quality. Instead, anthropogenic food sources may have attracted individuals to edges and increased encounters between potential EP mates. Simple opportunity seems likely to account for patterns of EP paternity in <b>spotted</b> <b>towhees,</b> suggesting that human altered environments have the potential to substantially affect EP mating behavior...|$|R
40|$|Habitat fragmentation, and the {{resulting}} increase in edge habitat, has important effects on birds, including the increased probability of nest predation, changes in habitat structure, and the increased presence of non-native plant species. It is critical to understand the effects of fragmentation at all stages of the avian life cycle, including the often overlooked postfledging period. Because much of juvenile mortality occurs during the immediate postfledging period, and juvenile mortality contributes substantially to population dynamics, {{it is necessary to}} understand if fledgling survival is reduced in edge habitats and if fledglings 2 ̆ 7 survival is influenced by their habitat use.

40|$|The current {{breeding}} range of Eastern Towhees (Pipilo erythrophthalmus) in Nebraska {{is described as}} westward to a line from Cedar Co through Platte, Hall, and Harlan Cos (NBR 64 : 124, Sharpe et al. 2001). Frequent recent sightings of Eastern Towhees during the breeding season have been made from more westward locations. A few reports are from Lincoln Co., 5 June 2004 by TJ Walker (NBR 72 : 91), and Dawson Co., 13 May 2004 by Laurel Badura (NBR 72 : 55). In contrast to the capture data presented here, none of the sightings is corroborated with breeding condition data such as cloacal protuberance or brood patch nor are nests located. Further recent sightings (Silcock in press NBR: 73) indicate the probability of <b>Spotted</b> <b>Towhee</b> genes in the eastern-most counties of Nebraska through intermediate songs and plumage. There are no other known capture studies that have data of the type presented here from the central Platte River valley. Sibley and West (1959), working from museum specimens, indicated genetic influences of Eastern Towhees in central Nebraska with their hybrid index based {{on a scale from}} 0 to 7 for combined sexes, with 0 being pure Eastern Towhee phenotypes and with scores greater than 0 influenced by <b>Spotted</b> <b>Towhee,</b> P. maculatus, genes.

40|$|Changes {{in forest}} {{management}} {{policies in the}} Pacific Northwest {{have resulted in a}} broad array of management alternatives to clearcutting on state and federal forest lands. These management alternatives should be monitored for their effects on animal use, particularly during critical periods for survival. We compared abundance of resident birds among three alternative silvicultural treatments (modified clearcut, two-story, small-patch group-selection) and unharvested controls during winter. Total bird abundance was highest in small-patch stands and lowest in modified clearcuts during winter. Species richness was highest in smallpatch stands and lowest in control and clearcut stands. Two species (Steller's jays (Cyanocitta stelleri) and golden-crowned kinglets (Regulus satrapa)) were most abundant in control stands and small-patch stands. <b>Spotted</b> <b>towhees</b> (Pipilo erythrophthalmus) were more abundant in two-story stands; dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis) were more abundant in harvested stands than control stands. The small-patch group-selection treatment retained structural and compositional complexity of vegetation and provided habitat for more individuals than two-story or modified clearcut treatments. However, two-story and modified clearcut treatments with components of mature and old-growth forests (snags, logs, large trees) provided habitat for several bird species during winter. Silvicultural treatments that retain structural and compositional vegetation complexity or develop late-successional characteristics more quickly than stands regenerating following traditional clearcutting practices may be used by more bird species and should be considered when developing stand management guidelinesChambers and McComb "Effects of silvicultural treatments on wintering bird communities in the Oregon coast range.

40|$|Urbanization poses {{threats to}} earth’s biota, and {{retention}} of remnant native habitat in protected areas within expanding urban boundaries may help alleviate threats to wildlife. However, it is unclear for nearly all nonsynanthropic (i. e., not benefiting from an association with humans) species whether vital rates in urban habitats can sustain populations or if populations persist only through immigration from outside the urban boundary. We conducted a three-year study of <b>spotted</b> <b>towhees</b> (Aves: Pipilo maculatus) breeding in four undeveloped parks in Portland, OR, USA, to measure park-specific seasonal reproductive output (F) and annual adult survival (SA). We developed a stochastic model that combined F and SA with an estimate of first-year survival to measure population growth rate (λ) in all parks assumed to be closed to immigration. F differed among parks but SA did not. Relatively high F was possible because many pairs raised 3 ̆e 1 brood/season. When combined with empirical estimates of survival through the 30 -day period of post-fledging parental care (SD = 0. 645), only 2 of 4 parks were self-sustaining (i. e., λ 3 ̆e 1. 0). However, SD reflected substantial loss of fledglings to domestic cats (Felis catus). Assuming no loss to cats and either partial compensatory or additive mortality of fledglings substantially improved prospects of population persistence for declining (sink) populations. Moreover, allowing low levels of immigration to sinks reversed population declines in most parks even when vital rates were insufficient to maintain populations. Our results suggest that nonsynanthropic bird species can persist in urban landscapes, but also that offspring mortality in the post-fledging period may be a critical determinant of population viability...|$|R
