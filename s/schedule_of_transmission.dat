Here, we illustrate how {{the interaction of}} an important predator and the <b>schedule</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> potential of two parasites can explain parasite abundance. A field survey showed that a noncastrating fungus (Metschnikowia bicuspidata) commonly infected a dominant zooplankton host (Daphnia dentifera), while a castrating bacterial parasite (Pasteuria ramosa) was rare. This result seemed surprising given that the bacterium produces many more infectious propagules (spores) than the fungus upon host death. The fungus's dominance {{can be explained by}} the schedule of within-host growth of parasites (i. e., how transmission potential changes over the course of infection) and the release of spores from "sloppy" predators (Chaoborus spp., who consume Daphnia prey whole and then later regurgitate the carapace and parasite spores). In essence, sloppy predators create a niche that the faster-schedule fungus currently occupies. However, a selection experiment showed that the slower-schedule bacterium can evolve into this faster-schedule, predator-mediated niche (but pays a cost in maximal spore yield to do so). Hence, our study shows how parasite life history can interact with predation to strongly influence the ecology, epidemiology, and evolution of infectious disease...|$|E

The key challenge in optimizing {{the performance of}} such systems is finding a good compromise among three interdependent quantities: 1) the density <b>of</b> <b>scheduled</b> transmitters; 2) the quality of transmissions; and 3) the long term fairness among nodes. We propose two new channel-aware slotted CSMA protocols opportunistic CSMA and quantile-based CSMA (QT-CSMA) and develop new stochastic geometric models to quantify their performance in terms of spatial reuse and spatial fairness. When properly optimized, these protocols offer substantial improve-ments in performance relative to CSMA—particularly, when the density of nodes is moderate to high. In addition, we show that a simple version of QT-CSMA can achieve robust performance gains without requiring careful parameter optimization. The quantitative results in this paper suggest that channel-aware scheduling in ad hoc networks can provide substantial bene-fits which might far outweigh the associated implementation overheads.
