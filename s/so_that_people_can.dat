5|$|One day, the Philistine leaders {{assemble}} in {{a temple}} for a religious sacrifice to Dagon, {{one of their}} most important deities, for having delivered Samson into their hands. They summon Samson <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> watch him perform for them. The temple is so crowded that people are even climbing onto the roof to watch—and all the rulers of the entire government of Philistia have gathered there too, some 3,000 people in all. Samson is led into the temple, and he asks his captors to let him lean against the supporting pillars to rest. He prays for strength and God gives him strength to break the pillars, causing the temple to collapse, killing him and the people inside.|$|E
5|$|The archaeological {{excavations}} {{that have}} been undertaken since 1998 are funded by Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council and grants from the Heritage Lottery Fund, and have received news coverage. The site {{is used as a}} training excavation for students and a community dig to introduce people to ancient history, with the participation of Mellor Archaeological Trust. In 2002, students from Ridge Danyers Sixth Form College built a replica roundhouse that is still standing on the site. Many of the artefacts discovered at Mellor during the excavations are on permanent display at Stockport Museum. The site {{is open to the public}} annually, in the first week of September, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> view the work done over the past season of digging.|$|E

25|$|The Lining: lining is {{considered}} an unnecessary burden and the Neapolitan tailors keep it as minimal as possible. Usually, the jacket is unlined or only half lined, {{in order to provide}} lightness; even the sleeves are completely unlined, as they’re meant to fit like a second skin. Additionally, the lining is often left open (“volante,” literally “flying”) <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> admire the fine details and construction of the jacket.|$|E
25|$|A karaoke bar, {{restaurant}}, club or lounge is a bar or {{restaurant that}} provides karaoke equipment <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> sing publicly, sometimes {{on a small}} stage. Most of these establishments allow patrons to sing for free, {{with the expectation that}} sufficient revenue will be made selling food and drink to the singers. Less commonly, the patron wishing to sing must pay a small fee for each song they sing. Both are financially beneficial for the establishment by not having to pay a professional singer or a cabaret tax which is usually applied to any entertainment of more than 1 person.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} {{took place}} in the form of new buildings being built inside the dome structure. The dome structure was not changed as part of the construction with the exception of blue lights being added to the support poles and plasma displays being added to some of the large sculptures around the dome. Construction started with the arena roof, which was built on the ground and then raised, as cranes could not be used in the dome structure. The construction then moved on to the arena building itself and the entertainment avenue around the arena building. A wide pathway between North Greenwich station and The O2 was also built, as well as the Peninsula Square piazza in front of the dome for special events. A glass roof was built over part of the pathway <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> walk from the station to The O2 without getting wet in rain. A covered path was also built between the QE2 Pier and The O2's main entrance. Buro Happold provided structural engineering for the project. The main civil engineering and construction contract for the development was awarded to Sir Robert McAlpine. Watson Steel Structures provided engineering for the 4500 tonne arena roof. M-E Engineers were the building services engineers for the project. T. Clarke were the electrical contractors. OR Consulting engineers set up a few interactive exhibitions within The O2. Keller Ground engineering prepared the ground for construction. Special ground preparation was necessary due to the contaminated soils from the industrial works which existed at the site before the dome. Catalytic converters were also installed within the dome to prevent toxic gases due to the dome structure being left in place. The plant cylinders, containing services equipment, and some piles used for the original dome, were reused. Financial consulting was provided by WT Partnership and EC Harris. The Waterfront partnership provided legal support for the development and continues to do so for The O2. Kerzner International helped with the development of the entertainment venues.|$|E

500|$|Writer {{and activist}} Seth Finkelstein noted that predictably several critics would label Carr's {{argument}} as a Luddite one, {{and he was}} not to be disappointed when one critic later maintained that Carr's [...] "contrarian stance [...] slowly forcing him into a caricature of Luddism". Then, journalist David Wolman, in a Wired magazine piece, described as [...] "moronic" [...] the assumption that the web [...] "hurts us more than it helps", a statement that was preceded by an overview of the many technologies that had been historically denounced; Wolman concluded that the solution was [...] "better schools as well as a renewed commitment to reason and scientific rigor <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> distinguish knowledge from garbage".|$|E

These revenants are called by the name of oupires or vampires, that is to say, leeches; and such particulars are related of them, so singular, so detailed, and invested with such probable circumstances and such judicial information, that one can hardly refuse to credit the belief which is held in those countries, that these revenants come out of their tombs and produce those effects which are proclaimed of them.|$|E

500|$|I {{try not to}} get too {{specific}} <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> {{apply the}} lyrics to their own lives. When I was growing up and listening to the radio and I would hear a song that reminded me of a certain person or a situation or whatever, I would {{want to be able to}} completely connect it to that moment. And then if I heard someone explaining it and making it into something totally different, it ruined it for me. So I kind of like to keep it open for people's imaginations. It evokes something different depending on who listens to it and at what time. [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] could give you a good, happy memory, or you could be miserable, crying, listening to it over and over.

[...] "I don't think this incident exposes any inherent weakness in Wikipedia, {{but it does}} expose a weakness {{that we will be}} working to address", Wales added. He insisted that Wikipedia editors still would be able to remain anonymous if they wished. [...] "We always prefer to give a positive incentive rather than absolute prohibition, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> contribute without a lot of hassle", Wales commented. However, he also warned that [...] "It's always inappropriate to try to win an argument by flashing your credentials, and even more so if those credentials are inaccurate." [...] However, Florence Devouard, chair of the Wikimedia Foundation, was not supportive of his credential proposal, saying, [...] "I think what matters is the quality of the content, which we can improve by enforcing policies such as 'cite your source,' not the quality of credentials showed by an editor." [...] A formal proposal that users claiming to have academic qualifications would have to provide evidence before citing them in content disputes was eventually rejected by the Wikipedia community, like all previous such proposals.|$|E

50|$|The work diagnoses {{the causes}} of the social, {{cultural}} and spiritual malaise which Weil saw as afflicting 20th century civilisation, particularly Europe but also the rest of the world. 'Uprootedness' is defined as a near universal condition resulting from the destruction of ties with the past and the dissolution of community. Weil specifies the requirements that must be met <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>can</b> once again feel rooted, in a cultural and spiritual sense, to their environment and to both the past and to expectations for the future. The book discusses the political, cultural and spiritual currents that ought to be nurtured <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> have access to sources of energy which will help them lead fulfilling, joyful and morally good lives. A leading theme is the need to recognise the spiritual nature of work.|$|R

[...] She reviews scientific literature in the biochemical libraries at U.C.L.A., for instance. Her references for Let's Get Well totaled almost 2,500, many from cases during her nutrition practice, and she was upset when the publisher of Let's Have Healthy Children eliminated the 2,000 references from the 1972 revision, says author Daniel Yergin.|$|E

2500|$|The unnamed, {{oblivious}} {{manager of}} the engineering division of Dilbert's company. Scott Adams states that he never named him <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> imagine him to be their boss. In earlier strips he was depicted as a stereotypical late-middle-aged balding middle manager with jowls; {{it was not until}} later that he developed his signature [...] "pointy hair" [...] and the jowls disappeared. He is hopelessly incompetent at management, and often tries to compensate for his lack of skills with countless group therapy sessions and business strategies which rarely bear fruit. He does not understand technical issues but always tries to disguise this, usually by using buzzwords he also does not understand. The Boss treats his employees alternately with enthusiasm or neglect; he often uses them to his own ends regardless of the consequences to them. Adams himself wrote that [...] "He's not sadistic, just uncaring". His level of intelligence varies from near-vegetative to perceptive and clever, depending on the strip's comic needs. [...] His utter lack of consistent business ethics, however, is perfectly consistent. His brother is a demon named [...] "Phil, the Prince of Insufficient Light", and according to Adams, the pointy hair is intended to remind one of devils' horns.|$|E
