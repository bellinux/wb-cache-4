50|$|Since silk, the {{original}} product, was gradually {{being replaced by}} more modern raw materials, Amann & Söhne started to manufacture <b>schappe</b> silk in 1919, and mercerised cotton in 1923. Alfred Amann died in 1942. Alfred Pielenz, his son-in-law, was nominated to become his successor. He guided the company through {{the last years of}} war, during which the production stagnated, as well as through the postwar years, during which the production was slowly being reconstructed.|$|E
50|$|All silk {{produced}} by the worm is composed of two substances: fibroin, the true thread, and sericin, which is a hard, gummy coating of the fibroin. Before the silk can be manipulated by machinery to any advantage, the gum coating must be removed, really dissolved and washed away. Where the method used in achieving this operation is through fermentation, the product is called <b>schappe.</b> The former, schapping, is the French, Italian and Swiss method, from which the silk when finished is neither so bright nor so good in colour as the discharged silk; {{but it is very}} clean and level, and for some purposes essential, as, for instance, in velvet manufacture.|$|E
50|$|The {{early years}} of the 20th century saw the {{manufacture}} of surgical threads which were woven rather than twisted. In 1907 a new artificial silk was produced specifically for the manufacture of Plauen lace. With the main factory unable to cope with demand, another was set up at Mundelsheim in 1910. A new product was added to the Amann range in 1919 with the manufacture of <b>schappe</b> silk (silk waste) and in 1921 an extension was built to house the colour dyeing plant. The latter was overseen by Johannes Mecheels, whose son, Otto Mecheels, went on to establish the Hohenstein Institute, a textile research centre situated at the edge of Bönnigheim. In 1923, mercerised cotton thread was produced, followed two years later by crocheting thread made from artificial silk.|$|E

40|$|Lately, orbital sensors of high spatial {{resolution}} are providing an increasing {{amount of data}} about the Earth surface. Analysis of these data implies in a high computational load, which has motivated researches on more efficient hardware and software for these applications. In this context, an issue lies in the image segmentation that involves long processing times and is a key step in object based image analysis. The recent advances in modern programmable graphics units or GPUs have opened the possibility of exploiting the parallel processing capabilities of this hardware to improve the segmentation performance. This work presents a parallel version of the multicriterion segmentation method, introduced originally by Baatz & <b>Schäppe</b> (2000), implemented in a GPU. The underlying hardware architecture consists of a massive parallel and manycore processor system designed for a general purpose computation and especially for image processing. The parallel algorithm is based on processing each pixel as a different thread so as {{to take advantage of}} the fine-grain parallel capability of the GPU. In addition to the parallel algorithm, the paper also suggests a modification to the heterogeneity computation that improves the segmentation performance. The experiments under the parallel algorithm show significant results, reaching up to 12 of speedup over the sequential algorithm. Pages: 7713 - 772...|$|E
40|$|En s’appuyant sur la théorie de l’échange social, cet article rend compte de l’effet médiateur des différentes formes de justice organisationnelle (distributive, procédurale, interactionnelle) dans la {{relation}} entre les pratiques en gestion des ressources humaines (GRH) inspirées du modèle de Lawler (1986) et l’engagement affectif. Les 134 répondants sont des directeurs aux services financiers d’une institution bancaire située au Québec. Des analyses de régression, effectuées selon les procédures de Kenny, Kashy et Bolger (1998), ont confirmé l’hypothèse de recherche. Ainsi, les résultats font ressortir que la perception de chacune des formes de justice organisationnelle représente une variable médiatrice essentielle pour que {{la mise en place}} des pratiques en GRH contribue efficacement au développement et à la consolidation de l’engagement des employés envers leur organisation. This study clarifies {{the role}} of organizational justice in the relationship between human resources management practices and commitment. Specifically, we develop and test a model in which the principal forms of justice (distributive, procedural and interactional) represent mediating variables in relationships between affective commitment and the four types of HRM practices (information sharing, knowledge development, non-monetary recognition and power sharing) included in the model developed by Lawler (1986). Meyer and Smith (2000) underscore that because few empirical studies have explored the relationship between HRM practices and commitment, it is important to determine how such practices influence employee commitment to organizations. Their results have shed light on {{the role of}} perception of organizational support and procedural justice as a mediating factor between certain HRM practices and organizational commitment. Consistent with the recommendation of these authors, our model rests on the theory of social exchange (Blau, 1964) and posits the three forms of organizational justice as mediating variables. Social exchange, unlike economic exchange, implies a relationship of exchange through unspecified obligations between the parties. Through the reciprocity norm, individuals in a climate of mutual trust maintain an exchange relationship with others to whom they feel obliged because they have received something from them. In a company, this pattern may correspond to organizations’ expectation that employees will develop favorable attitudes such as commitment in return for the introduction of HRM practices. Nonetheless, the specialized literature also clearly highlights theoretical links between social exchange and perceptions of organizational justice (Greenberg, 1987; Moorman, 1991). In this perspective, organizational justice encourages the development of effective commitment by enhancing employees’ feeling of reciprocity toward the organization, a sentiment created by the introduction of HRM practices. As part of this research project, a questionnaire was distributed in September 2001 to 232 managers of financial services of a private company operating in the Canadian banking sector. Of these questionnaires, 134 were returned, corresponding to a respectable response rate of 58 %. To test our research hypothesis, we carried out hierarchical regression analyses according to the steps described by Kenny, Kashy and Bolger (1998). These analyses confirmed our hypothesis by demonstrating that each of the forms of justice indeed represents a mediating variable between the practices specified by Lawler (1986) and affective commitment. More specifically, we conclude that: (1) non-monetary recognition has an indirect effect on commitment through the three forms of justice; (2) interactional justice is a mediating variable between knowledge development and commitment; (3) procedural justice is a mediating variable between the practices of autonomy, initiative and commitment and (4) consulting has both a direct and indirect effect on affective commitment through procedural justice. Our observations corroborate the results of previous studies (Meyer and Smith, 2000; <b>Schappe,</b> 1996) that had affirmed a mediating effect of procedural justice between certain practices and organizational commitment. This study also makes a significant contribution with important theoretical and practical implications. First, our research supplements the literature on this topic by proposing an integrating model that measures the simultaneous effect of a larger number of practices than previous studies and that integrates the three principal forms of justice as a mediating variable. Moreover, our results demonstrate that organizations should pay attention to their employees’ perception of justice if they want to significantly increase the employees’ affective commitment by putting HRM practices in place. Moreover, regarding the individual effects of practices, our results suggest that organizations should first target non-monetary recognition practices, followed by power sharing practices (consultation, autonomy, initiative) and knowledge development practices. Lastly, our results confirm that the competitive advantage of successful firms mainly arises from their capacity to increase the added value of their human resources (Becker and Huselid, 1999). To attain organizational success, they must innovate in HRM notably by applying practices that favor the adoption of positive attitudes and behaviors toward the organization. Companies should thus encourage managers to act in compliance with equity, impartiality and respect to stimulate the affective commitment of their employees and maximize the investment required by the introduction of HRM practices. Apoyándose en la teoría del intercambio social, este artículo da cuenta del efecto mediador de las diferentes formas de justicia organizacional (distributiva, procesal, internacional) en la relación existente entre las practicas de gestión de recursos humanos (GRH) inspiradas del modelo Lawler (1986) y el compromiso afectivo. Las 134 personas encuestadas son directores de servicios financieros de una institución bancaria ubicada en la provincia de Quebec. Los análisis de regresión, efectuados según el procedimiento de Kenny, Kashy y Bolger (1998), han confirmado la hipótesis de investigación. Así, los resultados destacan que la percepción de cada una de las formas de justicia organizacional representa una variable mediadora esencial para que la implantación de prácticas de GRH contribuya eficazmente al desarrollo y a la consolidación del compromiso de los empleados con su organización...|$|E

Materials include correspondence, speeches, scrapbooks, photographs, awards, campaign posters, audiotapes and clippings. Gift of Mr. and Mrs. Jules Gordon,Jonah Jamison Goldstein was born April 6, 1886 in Ontario, Canada to Abraham Getzel and Chaia (Jamison) Goldstein. His family moved to Madison Street on New York’s Lower East Side in 1891. Between 1905 and 1910, young Goldstein became {{a leader in the}} Educational Alliance, Jewish Big Brother Movement and East Side Neighborhood Association. In 1907, Goldstein graduated New York University Law School and started a law office with a brother and other lawyers. Goldstein claims that his law firm {{was one of the first}} in New York City to extend employment to African-American lawyers in 1919 and female lawyers in 1921. In 1931, Goldstein was appointed to the bench of the New York City Magistrates’ Court. While in that position, he authored The Family in Court (1936), which advocated for the extraction of domestic relations cases from the criminal court system. In 1939, he was elected Judge of the New York County Court of General Sessions and would be the judge presiding over the controversial Morris U. <b>Schappes</b> case of 1941. During his tenure as judge, he successfully pushed for reforms in the city court’s handling of domestic relations, women and youthful offenders. After his 1956 retirement from the Court of General Sessions, he remained active in legal affairs, for example, by pressing for shifts in drug law reform in New York State. Judge Goldstein ran for New York City Mayor in 1945 on the Republican-Liberal-City Fusion ticket, losing to William O’Dwyer. Goldstein was actively involved in such organizations as the Grand Street Boys’ Association, Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York, New York Jewish Committee of the Boy Scouts of America, Jewish Education Association and University Settlement. In 1920, Goldstein married Harriet B. Lowenstein, who was a lawyer, advisor to Felix Warburg, and comptroller of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee.
