500|$|Radiohead {{began work}} on their second album in 1994, hiring veteran Abbey Road Studios {{producer}} John Leckie. Tensions were high, with mounting expectations to deliver a follow-up to match the success of [...] "Creep". Recording felt unnatural in the studio, with the band having over-rehearsed the material. Seeking a change of scenery, they toured the Far East, Australasia and Mexico and found greater confidence performing their new music live. However, troubled by the fame he had achieved, Yorke became disillusioned with being [...] "at the <b>sharp</b> <b>end</b> of the sexy, sassy, MTV eye-candy lifestyle" [...] {{he felt he was}} helping to sell to the world.|$|E

2500|$|Yorke {{has been}} {{critical}} of the music industry and has pioneered alternative release platforms with Radiohead and his solo work. Following Radiohead's 1993 Pablo Honey tour of America, he became disenchanted with being [...] "right at the <b>sharp</b> <b>end</b> of the sexy, sassy, MTV eye-candy lifestyle" [...] he felt he was helping sell. The 1998 documentary Meeting People Is Easy portrays Yorke's disaffection with the music industry and press during Radiohead's OK Computer tour. After Radiohead's fourth album, Kid A (2000), was leaked via the peer-to-peer filesharing software Napster weeks before release, Yorke told Time he felt Napster [...] "encourages enthusiasm for music {{in a way that the}} music industry has long forgotten to do. I think anybody sticking two fingers up at the whole fucking thing is wonderful as far as I'm concerned." ...|$|E

[...] and [...] started working in unison at the <b>sharp</b> <b>end</b> of the bunch, and the leading men started climbing Mount Diablo with an advantage that had been reduced to {{a little more than a}} minute. The break splintered, leaving only Westra and De la Cruz in front in a bid for a stage win.|$|E
2500|$|Musa Qaleh {{was held}} by the Taliban {{during the time of}} the first series. The town was {{described}} by the MOD as [...] "a much sought after target for both ISAF and Taliban forces and scene of the heaviest fighting in the country". It was recaptured in December 2007 by ISAF and the Afghan National Army in the Battle of Musa Qala. While it {{was held by}} the Taliban Musa Qala was described by the MOD as [...] "a key staging post for arms and drugs transported to and from Pakistan and Iran", who stated that the Taliban want to regain control of it because of its tactical importance. Producer Matt Bennett said of 5 SCOTS, [...] "They’re very much at the <b>sharp</b> <b>end</b> of pushing back the Taliban and opening up that area around Musa Qala.", while Kemp stated [...] "Progress in Helmand rests and falls on what happens in Musa Qaleh.

Then two gryphons attack her, but she wounds the first gryphon by cutting its wing and kills the other by turning it into stone in mid-flight, sending it to crash into the ground with some of its debris hitting the soldiers. At the sight of this, Peter warns Edmund to leave the battle quoting [...] "get the girls, and get them home."

Edmund brings out his sword as Mr. Beaver tries to pull Edmund away saying [...] "Peter said get out of here!" [...] Edmund escapes saying [...] "Peter's not king yet" [...] and he runs to duel the Witch. Edmund is then pursued by two minotaurs. Fauns distract the first one while a gorilla intercepts the other minotaur making the road clear for Edmund. Along the way, Ginarrbrik is overwhelming {{and is about to}} kill a Red Dwarf, but Edmund wounds him by pushing him off the cliff. Edmund is about to face the White Witch, who was still on her way to petrify Peter. He manages to break her wand in half, making it useless as means of petrification.

6000|$|The break was wedge-shaped, {{with the}} <b>sharp</b> <b>end</b> {{off toward the}} rim, and it descended so rapidly as to appear almost perpendicular.

60|$|Then {{we all got}} mad.

60|$|The champion, moving onward amid these well-meant hints, {{ascended the}} {{platform}} by the sloping alley {{which led to}} it from the lists, and, to the astonishment of all present, riding straight up to the central pavilion, struck with the <b>sharp</b> <b>end</b> of his spear the shield of Brian de Bois-Guilbert until it rung again. All stood astonished at his presumption, but none more than the redoubted Knight whom he had thus defied to mortal combat, and who, little expecting so rude a challenge, was standing carelessly {{at the door of}} the pavilion.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And then, {{looking more}} nearly into their features, I saw some further peculiarities in their Dresden-china type of prettiness. Their hair, which was uniformly curly, {{came to a}} <b>sharp</b> <b>end</b> at the neck and cheek; there was not the faintest {{suggestion}} {{of it on the}} face, and their ears were singularly minute. The mouths were small, with bright red, rather thin lips, and the little chins ran to a point. The eyes were large and mild; and--this may seem egotism on my part--I fancied even that there was a certain lack of the interest I might have expected in them.|$|E
6000|$|Secondly, any knight {{proposing to}} combat, might, if he pleased, select a special {{antagonist}} {{from among the}} challengers, by touching his shield.
