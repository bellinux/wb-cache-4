Design/methodology/approach – In this paper, the soldering performance of plasma-treated HASL finish PCBs in nitrogen and air atmospheres have been evaluated using the wetting balance technique. The results were compared with the performance of conventionally flux-treated samples soldered in air and nitrogen atmospheres and non-flux treated samples soldered in air. Auger chemical analysis results were also compared with the solderability test results in order to obtain a complete profile of the plasma-treated and non-treated surfaces. Findings – The results of the auger chemical analysis show high organic (carbon) levels in the control samples and a significant drop in organic levels in the plasma-treated samples. The significant drop in the level of carbon leads to a decrease in contact angle and an increase in both surface energy and solder wettability. The results indicate that plasma cleaning of PCBs prior to soldering is a viable alternative to the conventional use of flux.

40|$|The EU RoHS {{legislation}} {{currently has}} an exemption {{to allow the}} continued use of lead based solder in Class A servers until at least 2010. There are industry proposals in place to extend this exemption to 2012 or beyond due to the added challenge of producing highly reliable lead-free server assemblies. Dell has surpassed the requirements of this legislation by transitioning all recently released Class A server printed circuit board assemblies to lead-free. This case study paper will outline the process followed, the testing performed, the material changes made, and the challenges that were met and overcome in this dedicated year-long effort by a large team of people. A great deal of reliability testing was performed to ensure there was no compromise to the expected life of the product. The most significant challenge was in selecting a PCB surface finish. Immersion silver has been ruled out due to its susceptibility to creep corrosion. OSP finish did not provide sufficient wetting capability after two surface mount passes. In the end, lead-free Hot Air <b>Solder</b> <b>Level</b> (HASL) finish was selected due to its superior solderability and testability.

40|$|The ban on lead in {{electronic}} industry caused manufacturers {{to search for}} alternative ways to replace lead without affecting the performance of electronic products. Among lead-free alternative surface finishes, pure tin plating has attracted greater attention as potential candidate to replace hot air <b>solder</b> <b>levelling</b> (HASL) {{in electronic}} application. However, tin whiskers were reported to form on tin surface finishes and have caused the failure to electronic components. The study regarding whiskers phenomenon is important especially with the miniaturisation of electronic components in the electronic industry because whiskers from adjacent area may touch each other, causing short circuit. The main objective {{of this research is}} to study tin whiskering behaviour of immersion tin plating after being exposed under two different temperatures and relative humidity conditions: normal condition (30 oC/ 60 %RH) and severe condition (55 oC/ 85 %RH). Tin layer was deposited by using immersion process. The effect of external stress on whiskers growth was investigated by applying indentation at 2 N load on tin surface. In addition, a nickel underlayer on copper substrate was deposited by electroless plating prior to tin plating to investigate the effectiveness of nickel underlayer in mitigating whiskers formation. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was used to observe the behaviour of tin whiskers and intermetallic compound (IMCs), Energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) was used to determine chemical composition and image analyser was used to measure coating thickness of tin, nickel and whiskers length based on micrographs obtained from FESEM. The results showed that whiskers have formed on immersion tin surface finish exposed under normal and severe conditions. These whiskers formed in various types including straight, bent, kinked, and spiral with striations along their circumference. The tin whiskers length was directly proportional to the exposure time for both conditions; normal and severe. However, under normal condition exposure, whiskers have grown longer than severe condition due to formation of small and irregular shape of IMCs. Indented area of tin surface showed shorter whiskers formed than non-indented area indicating that the whiskers grow longer at lower external stress concentration. The deposition of nickel underlayer on copper was effective in mitigating whiskers formation as no whiskers were observed under both conditions up to 12 weeks...|$|E

Therefore, {{it is essential}} to understand the level of ionic species on the electronic circuitry as well as the reliability risks caused by these contaminants. There are a number of approaches available in the industry to assess the reliability risks; for example, the water drop test (WDT) is one of the techniques used to determine the propensity of an ionic contaminant to cause electrical short failures by dendrite formation. The objective of this research is to determine the time to cause the failures, known as electrochemical migration (ECM) failures. A test vehicle was developed for the WDT to obtain the time to cause ECM failure in presence of different anions. The time to form dendritic bridges that cause short circuits was determined {{as a function of the}} different anions and the spacings between PCB pads. The experimental method involved dispensing aqueous solutions containing common inorganic and organic acid anions onto test vehicles, applying electrical bias voltages and measuring the time to form dendrites. Specially designed test structures cells were created to contain the test solutions. At each of the test cells, a cavity held the solution and constant current was applied through different metal geometries.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{melting point}} of Sn–Ag/Sn–Ag–Cu solders {{are higher than}} that of Sn–Pb solders by 30 C in particular. These in turn lead to {{significant}} divergences in plastic and creep behaviors. This research uses the validated finite-element analyses to study the elastic-plastic-creep behaviors of the 96. 5 Sn– 3. 5 Ag, 95. 5 Sn– 3. 8 Ag– 0. 7 Cu lead-free solders, and the classical 63 Sn– 37 Pb <b>solder</b> bumped wafer <b>level</b> chip scale package (WLCSP) on printed circuit board (PCB) assemblies subjected to four different temperature cycle tests. The behaviors of equivalent stress and equivalent total strain hysteresis loops are examined in the five key areas, which are the center, upper-right, upper-left, lower-right, and lower-left, at the outmost corner solder joint. It can be seen that: (1) for the elastic-plastic-creep behaviors to these three solder alloys, the range of the temperature loading is the most important factor to assess the reliability of the solder bumped WLCSP on PCB assemblies; (2) {{in the case of the}} same scale to the WLCSP and the WLCSP with underfill, the difference of the equivalent total strain range exceed an order of magnitude for all the three solder joints.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the end point of the plasma cleaning process, in order to save valuable production time and also to prevent the destruction of expensive devices through overheating. Design/methodology/approach – Post plasma cleaning analysis using dynamic contact angle (DCA) analysis and video microscope observations have been conducted on plasma treated Entec coated copper, hot air <b>solder</b> <b>levelled</b> (HASL) and electroless nickel immersion gold (ENIG) surfaces in order to determine the effect of surface finish on plasma process times. Post plasma cleaning and lead-free wave soldering analysis of the three surface finishes have been evaluated. Findings – The DCA results indicate that the end point for plasma cleaning of Entec coated copper is achieved within one to three minutes (indicated by a low contact angle hysteresis). Further cleaning after three minutes may lead to surface degradation and poor solder wettability. This is consistent with the results of the video microscope observations which show well soldered component leads and pads with good solder coverage for copper surface finish treated at a short plasma process time (one minute) and poorly soldered component leads and pads for a surface treated at a long process time (ten minutes). Similar work conducted on HASL and ENIG finishes show better results (well soldered component leads and solder pads) for longer plasma process times of five to ten minutes. Originality/value – This paper indicates that plasma process time determines the wettability and solderability of the treated samples. It shows that the plasma conditions including the process time must be optimised and characterised for every application in order to avoid damage to expensive devices.

40|$|INTRODUCTION In most {{electronic}} packaging applications {{it is not}} {{a single}} high stress event that breaks a component solder joint; rather it is repeated or prolonged load applications that result in fatigue or creep failure of the solder. The principal strain in solder joints is caused by differential expansion between the part and its mounting environment due to changes in temperature (thermal cycles) and/or due to temperature gradients between the part and the board. The function of strain relief elements [...] such as the flexible metal leads of the electronic components [...] is to lower the differential-expansion induced loads (stresses) on the <b>solder</b> joints to <b>levels</b> well below the solder yield strength, thus significantly reducing the generation of plastic strain. By reducing the developed strain, flexible leads greatly enhance solder joint reliability. Figure 1 - 1 illustrates a variety of flexible leads commo...|$|R

Although PBGA packages have many advantages such as {{a larger number of}} I/Os, robust assembly process, and better thermal / electrical performance, their board level reliability is still a major concern. This is because their solder joints have a relatively short stand-off height especially for the Chip Scale Package (CSP). It is a global trend to replace today's harmful lead-containing solders with lead-free solders in future electronic products. Although there are various lead-free solder systems available in the industry, people are still unsure over the selection of lead-free solders {{due to the lack of}} reliability data. When implementing such a large change in a material system, the effect on the reliability is always the first concern, especially at the board level. The implementation of the lead-free solders is a challenging process. It involves lots of study of process control and reliability for the board level interconnects. This brings out the value of the current study on the experimental evaluation of board <b>level</b> <b>solder</b> joint reliability of plastic ball grid array assemblies with eutectic lead-tin and lead-free solders. Four different reliability tests, namely the accelerated temperature cycling test, three point bending test, random vibration test, and the mechanical drop test were performed to evaluate the reliability of the lead-free board <b>level</b> <b>solder</b> joint.

Practical results: charts of distribution of the stress-deformed state, chart of distribution of the finish microhardness, interferogram, profilogram and table of flaws. The stress-deformed state was experimentally determined in the soldered joint with various flaws in the <b>soldered</b> seam. The <b>levels</b> of the permissible flaws in the soldered joint are determined. The recommendations are put into practice and pilot small lots of sealed housings of the microelectronic devices with soldered joints are produced. The results of the work provide for higher strength and durability of the soldered joints and for lesser number of flaws in the soldered joints by way of introducing additional operations during the assembly in the production processAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Conventional tin-lead solder alloys {{have been widely used}} in electronics interconnection owing to their properties such as low melting temperature, good ductility and excellent wettability on copper and other substrates. However, due to the worldwide legislation addressing the concern over the toxicity of lead, the usage of lead-containing solders has been phased out, thus stimulating substantial efforts on lead-free alternatives, amongst which eutectic Sn-Ag and Sn-Cu, and particularly Sn-Ag-Cu alloys, are promising candidates as recommended by international parties. To meet the increasing demands of advanced electronic products, high levels of integration of electronic devices are being developed and employed, which is leading to a reduction in package size, but with more and more input/output connections. Flip chip technology is therefore seen as a promising technique for chip interconnection compared with wire bonding, enabling higher density, better heat dissipation and a smaller footprint. This thesis is intended to investigate lead-free (eutectic Sn-Ag, Sn-Cu and Sn-Ag-Cu) wafer <b>level</b> <b>solder</b> bumping through electrodeposition for flip chip interconnection, as well as electroplating lead-free solderable finishes on electronic components. The existing knowledge gap in the electrochemical processes as well as the fundamental understanding of the resultant tin-based lead-free alloys electrodeposits are also addressed. For the electrodeposition of the Sn-Cu solder alloys, a methanesulphonate based electrolyte was established, from which near-eutectic Sn-Cu alloys were achieved over a relatively wide process window of current density. The effects of methanesulphonic acid, thiourea and OPPE (iso-octyl phenoxy polyethoxy ethanol) as additives were investigated respectively by cathodic potentiodynamic polarisation curves, which illustrated the resultant electrochemical changes to the electrolyte. Phase identification by X-ray diffraction showed the electrodeposits had a biphasic structure (β-Sn and Cu 6 Sn 5). Microstructures of the Sn-Cu electrodeposits were comprehensively characterised, which revealed a compact and crystalline surface morphology under the effects of additives, with cross-sectional observations showing a uniform distribution of Cu 6 Sn 5 particles predominantly along β-Sn grain boundaries. The electrodeposition of Sn-Ag solder alloys was explored in another pyrophosphate based system, which was further extended to the application for Sn-Ag-Cu solder alloys. Cathodic potentiodynamic polarisation demonstrated the deposition of noble metals, Ag or Ag-Cu, commenced before the deposition potential of tin was reached. The co-deposition of Sn-Ag or Sn-Ag-Cu alloy was achieved with the noble metals electrodepositing at their limiting current densities. The synergetic effects of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 600 and formaldehyde, dependent on reaching the cathodic potential required, helped to achieve a bright surface, which consisted of fine tin grains (200 nm) and uniformly distributed Ag 3 Sn particles for Sn-Ag alloys and Ag 3 Sn and Cu 6 Sn 5 for Sn-Ag-Cu alloys, as characterised by microstructural observations. Near-eutectic Sn-Ag and Sn-Ag-Cu alloys were realised as confirmed by compositional analysis and thermal measurements. Near-eutectic lead-free solder bumps of 25 μm in diameter and 50 μm in pitch, consisting of Sn-Ag, Sn-Cu or Sn-Ag-Cu solder alloys depending on the process and electrolyte employed, were demonstrated on wafers through the electrolytic systems developed. Lead-free solder bumps were further characterised by material analytical techniques to justify the feasibility of the processes developed for lead-free wafer <b>level</b> <b>solder</b> bumping...|$|R
40|$|WLCSP bumps have {{traditionally}} been produced by dropping preformed solder spheres through a metal template onto silicon wafers using modified surface mount stencil printers [1]. The squeegee blades associated with these printers have been retrofitted with a special fixture in which spheres are gravity feed down through a narrow slot. This same stencil printer {{is often used to}} apply the flux to the wafer just prior to sphere dropping. Several issues are associated with this technology that limit its widespread use in high volume and high yield applications. These limitations include: 1) there is a practical lower limit to the size of sphere that can be dropped, 2) the seal between the slotted fixturing and the wafer can fail, causing a release of all the spheres into the tool (often referred to as bursts or escapes), and 3) the yields are statistically low. One new WLCSP technology that is showing high promise toward eliminating these issues, is Wafer <b>Level</b> <b>Solder</b> Sphere Transfer (also called Gang Ball Placement) [2]. This technology uses a patterned vacuum plate to simultaneous pick up all of the preformed solder spheres, optically inspect for yield, and then transfer them over to the wafer. This paper will discuss this technology and the process parameters for producing WLCSP bumps. Throughput levels of 25 to 30 wafers per hour were measured. Yield losses of less than 10 ppm were realized for placing 300 µm spheres onto 200 mm wafers with ~ 80, 000 I/Os. Similar yields have been observed for placing 60 µm flip chip sized spheres onto semiconductor wafers...|$|R
40|$|WL-CSP {{is a low}} profile, true {{chip size}} package that is entirely built on a wafer using {{front-end}} and back end processing. The wafers can be batch-processed in a fab, which reduces the number of materials and packaging steps, reduces inventory, and allows for wafer level burn in and test. This technology is driven by cost, size, and ease of testing and is ideal for low to mid I/O devices. Peripheral bondpads from the die are redistributed into an area array using a photodielectric and a redistribution metal, {{eliminating the need for}} a substrate or interposer. Solder balls are placed onto the redistributed metal bondpads and reflowed, creating a large standoff which improves reliability. The bump structure and pad geometry of the test vehicle was optimized using simulation and validated by experimentation. This WL-CSP technology was evaluated using a 5 x 5 mm 2 die with a 0. 5 mm pitch 8 x 8 array of <b>solder</b> bumps. Board <b>level</b> reliability was performed using 1. 2 mm thick, 2 -layer FR- 4 boards with 0. 25 mm non-soldermask defined copper pads coated with OSP. Standard thickness WL-CSP wafers are 27 -mils. An evaluation was performed to evaluate the potential reliability improvement of WL-CSPs by thinning the wafers. Wafers were thinned down to 4 -mils thickness using two techniques. The first method is standard wafer backgrinding. The second is the novel approach of plasma etching, which results in a damage-free surface and improves wafer and die strength. Board level reliability will be presented comparing standard WL-CSPs to those thinned using the aforementioned techniques...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{advancement}} in high performance semiconductor packages {{has been driven}} by the need for higher pin count and superior heat dissipation. A one-piece cavity lid flip chip BGA package with high pin count and targeted reliability has recently been developed by UTAC. The flip chip technology can accommodate I/O count of more than five hundreds, and the die junction temperature can be reduced to a minimum level by a metal heat spreader attachment. Nonetheless, greater expectations on these high performance packages arose such as better substrate land estate utilization for multiple chips, ease in handling for thinner core substrates and improved board <b>level</b> <b>solder</b> joint reliability. A new design of the flip chip BGA package (patent pending) has been looked into for meeting such requirements. By encapsulating the flip chip with molding compound leaving the die top exposed, a planer top surface can be formed. And a flat lid can then be mounted on the planer mold/die top surface. In this manner the direct interaction of the metal lid with the substrate can be removed. The new package is thus less rigid under thermal loading and solder joint reliability enhancement is expected. This paper discusses the process development of the new package and its advantages for improved solder joint fatigue life, and being a multi-chip package and thin core substrate options. Finite element simulations have been employed for the study of its structural integrity, thermal and electrical performances. Detailed package and board level reliability test results will also be reported. 1...|$|R
40|$|Surface mount devices (SMDs), such as {{flip chip}} {{packages}} and {{ball grid array}} (BGA) packages are gaining in popularity in microelectronics industry because they provide high density inputs/outputs, better electrical and thermal performance. However, these solder bump interconnections in SMDs are sandwiched between the silicon die and the substrate, which makes them challenging to be inspected. Current non-destructive solder bump inspection techniques like electrical testing, X-ray and acoustic microscopy have some application gaps. New solder bump inspection technique is urgently needed to fill these gaps. Previous work has shown the potential of using a non-contact, non-destructive laser ultrasonics and laser interferometer based inspection system for assessing solder bump qualities. The system uses a pulsed Nd:YAG laser to induce ultrasound in the chip packages and a laser interferometer to measure the transient out-of-plane displacement on the package surface. The quality of the solder bumps can be evaluated by analyzing the out-of-plane displacement. However, {{there are still some}} gaps {{that need to be addressed}} before the system is ready on the shelf. This dissertation focuses on addressing some of these existing issues. The research work consists of the following: 1) a control interface was developed to integrate all the different modules to achieve automation. 2) a new signal-processing method for analyzing the transient out-of-plane displacement signals without requiring a known-good reference chip was developed. 3) the application scope of the system was expanded to inspect the second <b>level</b> <b>solder</b> bumps in BGA packages. Two types of process-induced defects including poor-wetting and solder bump voids were investigated. Meanwhile, solder bump fatigue caused by cyclic mechanical bending and thermal cycle was also studied using this system. 4) a finite element analysis was performed to study the thermo-mechanical reliability of solder bumps in PBGA package under cyclic thermal loads. The successful completion of the research objectives has led to a laser ultrasound solder bump inspection system prototype with more user-friendliness, higher throughputs, better repeatability and more flexibility, which accelerate the commercialization the system.
