2500|$|Humans metabolize ethanol {{primarily}} through NAD-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) class I enzymes (i.e. ADH1A, ADH1B, and ADH1C) to acetaldehyde and then metabolize acetaldehyde primarily by NAD-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) to acetic acid. [...] Eastern Asians reportedly have a deficiency in acetaldehyde metabolism in a surprisingly high percentage (approaching 50%) of their populations. [...] The {{issue has been}} most thoroughly investigated in native Japanese where persons with a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variant allele of the ALDH2 gene were found; the variant allele, encodes lysine (lys) instead of glutamic acid (glu) at amino acid 487; this renders the enzyme essentially inactive in metabolizing acetaldehyde to acetic acid. The variant allele is variously termed glu487lys, ALDH2*2, and ALDH2*504lys. In the overall Japanese population, about 57% of individuals are homozygous for the normal allele (sometimes termed ALDH2*1), 40% are heterozygous for glu487lys, and 3% are homozygous for glu487lys. Since ALDH2 assembles and functions as a tetramer and since ALDH2 tetramers containing one or more glu487lys proteins are also essentially inactive (i.e. the variant allele behaves as a dominant negative), homozygote individuals for glu487lys have undetectable while heterozygote individuals for glu487lys have little ALDH2 activity. [...] In consequence, Japanese individuals homozygous or, to only a slightly lesser extent, heterozygous for glu487lys metabolize ethanol to acetaldehyde normally but metabolize acetaldehyde poorly and are susceptible {{to a set of}} adverse responses to the ingestion of, and sometimes even the fumes from, ethanol and ethanol-containing beverages; these responses include the transient accumulation of acetaldehyde in blood and tissues; facial flushing (i.e. the [...] "oriental flushing syndrome" [...] or Alcohol flush reaction), urticaria, systemic dermatitis, and alcohol-induced respiratory reactions (i.e. rhinitis and, primarily in patients with a history of asthma, mild to moderately bronchoconstriction exacerbations of their asthmatic disease. [...] These allergic reaction-like symptoms, which typically occur within 30–60 minutes of ingesting alcoholic beverages, do not appear to reflect the operation of classical IgE- or T cell-related allergen-induced reactions but rather are due, at least in large part, to the action of acetaldehyde in <b>stimulating</b> <b>tissues</b> to release histamine, the probable evoker of these symptoms.|$|E
40|$|While most bone {{fractures}} {{can heal}} simply by being stabilized, others {{can take a}} longer time to rejoin or they could fail to merge back together completely. Numerous studies have shown the positive effects that ultrasonic therapy have had on delayed-union and non-union bone fracture repair but little is known as to what specific biological mechanisms are at play. Ultrasound may be a valuable tool for bone tissue regeneration at these fracture sites using a tissue engineering approach, however, more must be understood about its impact on <b>stimulating</b> <b>tissues</b> to heal before {{this can be a}} reality. For that reason, this study shows {{that it is possible to}} utilize an in-silico finite element analysis model to show both three-dimensional predictive hydrogel deformation and the displacement of beads and cells in the hydrogel from the ultrasound-generated acoustic radiation force. The model used for this is collagen based hydrogels seeded with pre-osteoblast cells and polystyrene beads. This is done in order to provide quantitative confirmation of real-time deformation imaging in a study showing the effect of remote physical forces provided by ultrasonic therapy on bone healing...|$|E
40|$|In 1787 Aloysio Luigi Galvani (1737 - 1798), at {{that time}} Professor of Anatomy at the University of Bologna, {{demonstrated}} that {{the muscles of the}} hind limbs of a frog manifested "electromotive phenomena. " A partly dissected frog's leg with a metal scalpel accidentally left in contact with an exposed nerve showed muscle contractions whenever a nearby electrostatic apparatus was rotated. Ensuing experiments led him to describe a method for <b>stimulating</b> <b>tissues</b> electrically by simply touching a muscle or nerve with two rods of clissimilar metals bound together, believing that it was due to electricity generated within the tissues. Allesandro Volta (1745 - 1827), Professor of Physics at the University of Pavia, challenged Galvani's interpretation by denying the existence of animal electricity, believing that the stimulation was due to electricity generated at the points of contact of the two metals. Thus arose a famous scientific controversy. To meet Volta's objection Galvani develo ped an experiment in which muscle contraction was induced using living tissue instead of metal rods. He showed that if a nerve was made to touch another tissue a two points, one injured and the other uninjured, the muscle supplied by the nerve would contract. This was the first unequivocal demonstration of the existence of electricity in living tissue and also the first description of the current of injury. Since then many researchers were "galvanized" by all kinds of electrical phenomena in various animal models, some of these related to the heart...|$|E

40|$|Long-term neuroprostheses for {{functional}} {{electrical stimulation}} must efficiently <b>stimulate</b> <b>tissue</b> without electrolyzing water {{and raising the}} extracellular pH to toxic levels. Comparison of the stimulation efficiency of tungsten wire electrodes (W wires), platinum microelectrode arrays (PtMEA), as-grown vertically aligned carbon nanofiber microbrush arrays (VACNF MBAs), and polypyrrole coated (PPy-coated) VACNF MBAs in eliciting field potentials in the hippocampus slice indicates that, at low stimulating voltages that preclude the electrolysis of water, only the PPy-coated VACNF MBA is able to stimulate the CA 3 to CA 1 pathway. Unlike the W wires, PtMEA, as-grown VACNF MBA, and the PPy-coated VACNF MBA elicit only excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). Furthermore, the PPy-coated VACNF MBA evokes somatic action potentials in addition to EPSPs. These results highlight the PPy-coated VACNF’s advantages in lower electrode impedance, ability to <b>stimulate</b> <b>tissue</b> through a biocompatible chloride flux, and stable vertical alignment in liquid that enables access to spatially confined regions of neuronal cells...|$|R

40|$|An {{electrophysiologic}} {{technique was}} used to measure changes in cell water volume in response to isosmotic luminal solution ion replacement. Intracellular Cl- activity (aCl-i) was measured and net flux determined from the changes in volume and activity. Reduction of luminal solution [Cl-] from 98 to 10 mM (Cl- replaced with cyclamate) resulted in a large fall in aCl-i with no significant change in cell water volume. Elevation of luminal solution [K+] from 2. 5 to 83. 5 mM (K+ replaced Na+) caused a small increase in aCl-i with no change in cell water volume. Exposure of the Necturus gallbladder epithelium to agents that increase intracellular cAMP levels (forskolin and/or theophylline) induces an apical membrane electrodiffusive Cl- permeability accompanied by a fall in aCl-i and cell shrinkage. In <b>stimulated</b> <b>tissues,</b> reduction of luminal solution [Cl-] resulted in a large fall in aCl-i and rapid cell shrinkage, whereas elevation of luminal solution [K+] caused a large, rapid cell swelling with no significant change in aCl-i. The changes in cell water volume of <b>stimulated</b> <b>tissues</b> elicited by lowering luminal solution [Cl-] or by elevating luminal solution [K+] were reduced by 60 and 70 %, respectively, by addition of tetraethylammonium (TEA+) to the luminal bathing solution. From these results, we conclude that: (a) In control tissues, the fall in aCl-i upon reducing luminal solution [Cl-], without concomitant cell shrinkage, indicates that the Cl- entry mechanism is electroneutral (Cl- /HCO 3 -) exchange. (b) Also in control tissues, the small increase in aCl-i upon elevating luminal solution [K+] is consistent with the recent demonstration of a basolateral Cl- conductance. (c) The cell shrinkage elicited by elevation of intracellular cAMP levels results from conductive loss of Cl- (and probably K+). (d) Elevation of cAMP inhibits apical membrane Cl-/HCO- 3 -exchange activity by 70 %. (e) The cell shrinkage in response to the reduction of mucosal solution [Cl-] in <b>stimulated</b> <b>tissues</b> results from net K+ and Cl- efflux via parallel electrodiffusive pathways.
