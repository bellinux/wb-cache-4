After several minutes of teasing, Beyoncé approaches the detective, {{who is now}} smiling, and knocks a <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> <b>papers</b> off of his desk so she can rub against him. She then pulls open the blinds to let light in. At the same time, several other women are seen {{to be present in}} the room. They were apparently there all along, hidden in the darkness. Together, they give a choreographed teaser dance in front of their own respective antique fans while their hair is blowing. The women move about to continue the dance elsewhere in the room, executing some hip-shaking moves. They later perform a chair-dancing routine with Beyoncé, and whip their hair back and forth. The video ends with a fade to black as Beyoncé approaches the man at his desk.|$|E
25|$|Realizing a {{need for}} {{up-to-date}} textbooks on dental hygiene, Wilkins began writing and mimeographing handouts for her students. Over the years, the <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> <b>papers</b> accumulated, and soon Wilkins was approached by a textbook seller about turning her writing into a book. The first edition of Clinical Practice of the Dental Hygienist was published in 1960. The book has since become a cornerstone of text in dental hygiene programs. Wilkins released updated editions of the textbook through its 12th edition in 2016. The book has been translated into many languages, including Japanese, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Canadian French, and is used in dental hygiene schools around the world.|$|E

In such a case, the adjacent planes are not straight, but instead bend around the edge of the terminating plane so that the crystal structure is perfectly ordered on either side.

These cutters are only intended for a few sheets, with up to ten sheets being the practical cutting limit. A large <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> applies torsional forces on the hinge, pulling the blade away from the cutting edge on the table.

The other project considers the ejection of a cone of plasma with entrained particles from the impact zone, its expansion as it traverses a region of free space, and its impact on a <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> sheets.

50|$|Paper drills are {{machines}} {{similar to}} a drill press that use hollow drill bits to drill through <b>stacks</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper.</b> The hollow bit design allows the chads to be ejected during drilling.

50|$|A bulldog clip is {{a device}} for {{temporarily}} but firmly binding {{sheets of paper}} together. It consists of a rectangular sheet of springy steel curved into a cylinder, with two flat steel strips inserted to form combined handles and jaws.

50|$|One of {{the most}} common {{situation}} factors is the occurrence of the bystander effect. The bystander effect is the phenomenon that an individual’s likelihood of helping decreases when passive bystanders are present in a critical situation. For example, when someone drops a <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> <b>papers</b> on a crowded sidewalk, most people are likely to continue passing him/her by. This example can be extended to even more urgent situations, such as a car crash or natural disaster.|$|E

5000|$|Conversely, if one {{perceives}} {{a negative}} violation valence but views the communicator reward valence as positive, {{it is likely}} that the person will compensate for his or her partner's negative behavior. For example, one day your boss appears sullen and throws a <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> <b>papers</b> in front of you. Rather than grunt back, EVT predicts that you will compensate for your boss' negativity, perhaps by asking if everything is OK (Guerrero & Burgoon, 1996). More difficult to predict, however, is the situation in which a person who is viewed unfavorably violates another with positive behavior. In this situation, the receiver may reciprocate, giving the person the [...] "benefit of the doubt." ...|$|E
50|$|A music video, {{directed}} by Adam Boatman, was released {{for the song}} in March 2009. The video follows a chain of events, which depicts how one good deed leads to another. It begins with a mother giving money to a man playing guitar on the sidewalk, who walks into a coffee shop and loans money to a businessman who left his wallet at home. The businessman then helps a woman pick up her <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> <b>papers</b> that scatters when she falls over. Later, the woman takes {{a seat on the}} bench and waits for the bus. The mother from the beginning arrives at the bus stop and she gives up her seat for her. Included with these are scenes of the trio singing in a small hotel room.|$|E
50|$|Knife is {{the cutting}} die for {{envelope}} or wrapper blanks. It {{is called a}} knife rather than a die because the latter is an object that makes an embossed printed impression of the stamp or indicium on the envelope. Traditionally, a knife would normally be made of forged steel. It was placed on a <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper</b> with the sharp edge against the paper. The press head forced the cutting edge {{all the way through}} the <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> <b>paper.</b> The cut blanks were removed from the knife and the process repeated. Not only could it cut out the odd shape of an envelope, but a knife could be used to cut out shapes of airmail stickers or gummed labels in the shape of stars or circles. The variety of shapes a knife could cut would be infinite.|$|R

50|$|There are office models {{available}} for the perforation of 1 to 150 sheets <b>of</b> <b>paper,</b> and industrial models for up to 470 sheets.

50|$|The magazine’s covers were {{of great}} {{importance}} to not only its own success but also significantly {{to the success of}} Casas. The artist designed each cover, which he always created in color as to attract the eye of the public and gain readership. This platform brought him a great deal of recognition for his artwork. He used a mixture of mediums, such as pencil, charcoal, and ink, to create these covers. Some of the original drawings are on display in the National Art Museum of Catalonia. Perhaps the most recognizable of these images is the cover from issue 11, published 12 August 1899. The drawing features a woman slouched on a desk behind a <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> <b>papers,</b> a feather quill in hand and the magazine’s title etched above her.|$|E

My thanks to Ella Lee McGee, the owner of the house he was rooming in for letting me stay with her during my college career, and to Belva Jo McGee's 12-year-old daughter for putting up with me the way she did, she had to I know, but I fell in love with her about a week ago, if she was older I would have asked her to marry me, but that would be impossible.Why did I take my own life? Well, when you committed two double murders you would too. Yes I did kill Betty Jo Booker and Paul Martin in the city park that night, and killed Mr. Starks and tried to get Mrs. Starks. You wouldn't have guessed it, I did it when Mother was either out or asleep, and no one saw me do it. For the guns, I disassembled them and discarded them in different places. When I am found, which has already been done, please give this typewriter to Craig older brother, and tell him that I hope that his child is a boy, it will (help) him in his work. Everything can go wherever you think it will do best except for the View-Master which will go to Belva Jo. Please take my bankroll and give it to Daddy, I think it should go to him, and tell him I don't want the car now.Well, goodbye everybody. See you sometime, if I make the grade which will be hard for me to make.H. B. Tennison ...|$|E
