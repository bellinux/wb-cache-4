5000|$|Allometric {{engineering}} {{is the process}} of experimentally shifting the scaling relationships, for body size or shape, in a population of organisms. More specifically, the process of experimentally breaking the tight covariance evident among component traits of a complex phenotype by altering the variance of one trait relative to another. Typically, body size is one of the two traits. The measurements of the two traits are plotted against each other and the scaling relationship can be represented as: [...] Manipulations of this sort alter the scaling relationships either by shifting the intercept (b), <b>slope</b> (<b>m)</b> or both to create novel variants (see: Allometry, for more details). These novel variants can then be tested for differences in performance or fitness. Through careful testing, one could sequentially test each component of a trait suite to determine how each part contributes to the function of the entire complex phenotype, and ultimately the fitness of the organism. This technique allows for comparison within or among biological groups differing in size by adjusting morphology to match one another and comparing their performances.|$|E
5000|$|Also {{introduced}} by Chou in 1976 was the median-effect plot {{which is a}} plot of log (D) vs log (fa)/(1-fa) or log (fa)/(fu) yields a straight line with <b>slope</b> (<b>m)</b> and the x-intercept of log (Dm), where Dm equals to the anti-log of the x-intercept. This unique theory holds true for all dose-effect curves that follows the physico-chemical principle of the mass-action law, for all entities regardless of the first-order or higher-order dynamics, and regardless of unit or mechanism of actions.3 MEE is derived by system analysis using enzyme kinetics and mathematical inductions and deductions where hundreds of mechanism specific individual equations are reduced to a single general equation. 3 Both left and right sides of the MEE are dimensionless quantities. When the m and Dm are determined, the full dose-effect curve is defined. Since the median-effect plot yields straight lines, the theoretical minimum of only two data points allow the drawing of the full dose-effect curve, when the effect is accurately determined. This fundamental revelation defies the common held belief that two data points cannot draw a defined does-effect curve. The main significance of MEE is the mediation that [...] "Dose" [...] and [...] "Effect" [...] or [...] "Mass" [...] and [...] "Function" [...] are interchangeable. The [...] "Mass" [...] vs [...] "Energy" [...] was defined E=MC2 for subatomic fission and fusion; Now [...] "Mass" [...] vs [...] "Action" [...] is defined by MEE for supramolecular dynamics.|$|E
