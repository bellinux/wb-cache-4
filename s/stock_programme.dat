Bayesian analyses and genotypic simulations identified 140 putative hybrids (11 · 5 % of the total sample) with varying levels of introgression. Most hybrids were observed in an area extending from the Snowy River to the Albert River suggesting a hybrid zone in the eastern Bass Strait region. Sixteen hybrids, however, were found outside this zone, possibly reflecting the movement of hybrid offspring between estuaries or their inadvertent release during fish <b>stocking</b> <b>programmes.</b> Biparental backcrossing was found to occur suggesting that hybrids were fertile.

40|$|Abstract: The {{restoration}} of previously extinct salmon populations is usually achieved with <b>stocking</b> <b>programmes,</b> but nat-ural recolonization can also occur through the straying of individuals from nearby populations. Here we investigated {{the origin of}} Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) that recently recolonized the Seine River (France). The degradation of this river had led to the extinction of the population, but since the 1990 s, the water quality has greatly improved. Although no stock-ing was performed, 162 individual salmon were recently observed by video-counting. Seven fish were sampled for mor-phological and genetic analyses. These individuals were genotyped at 17 microsatellites markers and their probable source populations were identified using baseline samples from regional and distant populations. Four of the sampled individuals were grilse and three were multi-sea-winter fish. Genetic analyses revealed that the fish partly originated from a nearby stock but also from distant populations, suggesting long-distance straying. This natural recolonization of a large river by strayers from several origins is {{discussed in terms of}} population sustainability and management.

40|$|The good prices paid to {{fishermen}} for eels {{have led}} to an increased interest in eel capture in Ireland. In that regard the results of stock assessments examined in conjunction with records obtained from other European eel fisheries, have indicated that the present national catch could be increased by at least 100 % and perhaps by several times as much. Such an improvement could be effected by the overland transport of elvers from collection points near the coast. An operation of this kind in already in progress on the Shannon river system undertaken by the Electricity Supply Board who own the entire fishery. Sampling of eels within that system have indicated that substantial increases {{in the numbers of}} growing eels in the lakes and in the numbers of male silver eels captured, have taken place. Since it takes between ten and twenty years from the beginning of a <b>stocking</b> <b>programme</b> for any results to be apparent it is essential to devise a system for making an accurate assessment of the developments.

40|$|The {{decline in}} fish stocks is well {{documented}} and numerous efforts are in place to preserve and rebuild <b>stocks.</b> While conservation <b>programmes</b> {{have the potential to}} improve profitability, this usually will not occur before contraction in the fishery (in landings, incomes, employment, etc.). Conservation programmes are therefore risky ventures for fishermen, because they may not financially survive until profitability improves and because the programme itself might not deliver its promises. One crucial element in commercial stock replenishment measures is the co-operation and support of fishermen. Using recent survey data fishermen?s opinions on the current state of fish stocks and on the viability of conservation programs are investigated. The paper also examines fishermen?s attitudes to risk and estimates their subjective risk premium on <b>stock</b> conservation <b>programmes.</b> The results suggest that fishermen support the need for stock replenishment measures but evidence of high discount premiums required for acceptance of risky stock replenishment programs indicates that voluntary participation without compensation cannot be assumed...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{attempts}} in many countries, large-scale prawn (shrimp) <b>stock</b> enhancement <b>programmes</b> {{have only been}} implemented and continue to operate in Japan (Penaeus japonicus) and China (Penaeus chinensis). In these countries, prawn stock enhancement has been possible because of the capacity to produce large numbers of small individuals for release {{as a result of}} aquaculture. While exploring the feasibility and bio-economics of tiger prawn (Penaeus esculentus) stock enhancement in Exmouth Gulf, Australia, a broad framework for stock enhancement research was developed. This framework included developing a bio-economic model and risk assessment for all components of a stock enhancement operation, i. e., hatchery, grow-out, harvest-transport-release, population dynamics of released and wild prawns, and monitoring the fishery. However, predictions from the bio-economic model were made with great uncertainty about the values for post-release mortality of prawns because there were no data from experiments on optimal release strategies. Consequently, data from field studies of growth, and laboratory studies of predation, were used to set values for growth and mortality in Monte-Carlo simulations of the potential success of P. esculentus releases in different habitats. The survival of 2 mm carapace length (CL) prawns to the size at emigration from the nursery habitat was ∼ 1. 9 times higher for individuals associated with seagrass of high (∼ 100 g m- 2) than for those in low (∼ 10 g m- 2) plant biomass. Survival was 19 times higher for prawns in high biomass seagrass than for those on bare substratum. The differences in survival between habitats were reduced greatly when the releases of much larger prawns (10 mm CL) were simulated. These findings highlight the importance of research on developing optimal release strategies for prawns in <b>stock</b> enhancement <b>programmes.</b> In particular, the size, habitat, time and density at release needs to be identified to provide more reliable information for the bio-economic assessments of releasing hatchery-reared juveniles to augment production in <b>stock</b> enhancement <b>programmes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Poor {{regulated}} fishery, pollution, {{fragmentation and}} loss of habitat are most important factors influencing decline of sterlet population worldwide. In Middle and Lower Danube region, this species still have significant economic importance since wilde populations are commercially exploited, while Upper Danube populations are dependent on stocking efforts {{in order to maintain}} their presence in open waters. Aim of present study is to analyze genetic diversity of sterlet populations from the Middle and Lower Danube and Lower Tisza rivers, as a prerequisite for their effective conservation and management. Analysis of a highly variable D-loop fragment of mitochondrial DNA detected five new haplotypes, while the eight previously identified haplotypes had extended their previous range. Genetic variability could be attributed almost entirely to individuals, with observed lack of population structure. Negative values of neutrality test indicate recent expansion on some sampling locations. Adittionaly, gene flow analysis between Lower and Middle Danube region showed intensive exchange of speciemens. At the same time analysis showed some influence of Tisza dam on gene flow between samples from Tisza and Middle Danube section.

40|$|Microsatellite markers {{were used}} to examine spatio-temporal genetic {{variation}} in the endangered eastern freshwater cod Maccullochella ikei in the Clarence River system, eastern Australia. High levels of population structure were detected. A model-based clustering analysis of multilocus genotypes identified four populations that were highly differentiated by F-statistics (F(ST) = 0. 09 - 0. 49; P < 0. 05), suggesting fragmentation and restricted dispersal particularly among upstream sites. Hatchery breeding programmes {{were used to}} re-establish locally extirpated populations and to supplement remnant populations.

40|$|Temporal {{variations}} of fish yields in four major reservoirs in Thailand (Ubolratana; Sirindhorn; Srinakarin; Vajiralongkorn) were investigated {{with the use}} of long-term fish landing data (≥ 20 years). The long-term variations in fish yield, measured as the coefficient of variation of yearly yield, ranged mostly between 50 % and 100 %. For short-term variations, the means of the relative variation (85 %) were larger than the absolute variation (63 %). This finding indicates that short-term variations were inversely related to fish yield and that a higher uncertainty occurs when fish catches are low. The stocked exotic species exhibited higher variations than the indigenous species. The trend analyses indicated some species had sharply declined fish landings, while some species were quite stable (i. e. reservoir-adapted species). Stocked species tended to increase in relatively shallow reservoirs, compared to the deep reservoir. Fish landing data for each reservoir were patternized, using the self-organizing map, indicating temporal trends of chronological order. The differences among clusters in each reservoir were with respect to the weight of each species in the fish landings in each year, and temporal changes in species composition in the reservoirs, which would primarily be attributed to the environmental changes followed by anthropogenic pressures. The mean trophic level (τ) fluctuated, resulting from changes in species composition and weight of fish landing, as well as fish <b>stocking</b> <b>programmes...</b>|$|R

50|$|Despite {{the success}} of the trout fry <b>stocking</b> <b>programme,</b> the health of the River Avon {{continued}} to decline. The river bed became compacted and many parts of the river turned into muddy, stagnant bogs from all the silt and mud running off the surrounding land and the untreated sewage and farm waste that ended up in the river. The river was rapidly becoming unsuitable for trout. Frank Sawyer undertook a major project in the early 1950s known as ‘the great clean up.’ This involved dredging the worst hit areas of the river to remove mud and silt and return the bed to chalk and gravel. Old sluices and hatch gates that impounded or reduced flow were removed to speed up the flow and scour the beds clear of filth. Old water meadow carrier streams were restored to provide a natural filter and a nursery for small fish and insects. Finally silt catchment pits were dug in the worst hit areas to prevent the silt and run off from reaching the main river. The great clean up had a huge and profound effect on the River Avon. The river returned to its former glory as one of the world’s premier chalk streams. There was no longer a requirement to stock trout as the natural regeneration was sufficient. There was an explosion in fly and other river life and the fishing was described by all SDFFA members as the best {{in the history of the}} river.|$|R

40|$|Abstract In less-developed countries, {{fisheries}} enhancement using stocking is {{a common}} practice to manage reservoirs for biomass production. In many cases, {{there appears to be}} little control over whether the stocking activity is appropriate or necessary. Cuban reservoir fisheries have been usually managed to maximize fish biomass. Blue tilapia have been introduced and supplemented in reservoirs, and Chinese carp are introduced and maintained in reservoirs throughout the entire island. Supplemental stocking with introduced fish species is a usual practice to manage large and medium-sized reservoirs. Small and very small reservoirs have been managed as semi-intensively enhanced fisheries with carp and tilapia stocking. The main purposes of the present paper are to study the factors contributing to the outcome of <b>stocking</b> <b>programmes</b> in reservoirs and to test the hypotheses that supplementary stocking for selfsustained fish populations usually cannot contribute to increase fish yield. Yield and stocking data by groups of fish species were available for Cuban reservoirs. Total fish yield was only slightly related to total fish stocking density for the complete set of reservoirs. However, this result was mainly because of the relationship between total yield and cyprinid stocking for semi-intensively-used reservoirs. Tilapia yield was not significantly related to tilapia stocking for both extensively and semi-intensively-used reservoirs. However, yield and stocking for cyprinids were highly related for both reservoir subsets. Therefore, cyprinid stocking was effective in certain reservoirs, but tilapia stocking was not effective in any reservoir. Moreover, tilapia stocking was a superfluous activity for reservoirs where tilapia have an adequate natural reproduction cycle...|$|R
