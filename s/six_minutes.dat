40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to assess the}} correlation between a self-administered, adapted <b>Six</b> <b>Minute</b> Walk Test (the Home-Heart-Walk) and the standard <b>Six</b> <b>Minute</b> Walk Test based on the American Thoracic Society guideline. A correlational study was conducted at a university campus in Sydney, Australia. Thirteen healthy volunteers underwent the Home-Heart-Walk and the standard <b>Six</b> <b>Minute</b> Walk Test on a single occasion. The distance that participants walked during the two tests was assessed using Pearson 2 ̆ 7 s correlation. The correlation between the Home-Heart-Walk and the <b>Six</b> <b>Minute</b> Walk Test distance was 0. 81. The Home-Heart-Walk distance was highly correlated to the standard <b>Six</b> <b>Minute</b> Walk Test distance in this study. This relationship provides confidence for further research in populations to facilitate monitoring and evaluation...|$|R

40|$|Pulmonary {{hypertension}} (PH) occurs {{frequently and}} results in functional limitation in advanced COPD. Data regarding the functional consequence of PH in less severe COPD are limited. Whether echocardiographic evidence of right sided heart pathology is associated with functional outcomes in patients with non-severe COPD is unknown. We evaluated pulmonary function, <b>six</b> <b>minute</b> walk distance, and echocardiography in 74 consecutive patients with non-severe COPD. We performed multivariable linear regression to evaluate the association between right heart echocardiographic parameters and <b>six</b> <b>minute</b> walk distance adjusting for lung function, age, sex, race, and BMI. The mean <b>six</b> <b>minute</b> walk distance was 324 ± 106 meters. All subjects had preserved left ventricular (LV) systolic function (LV ejection fraction 62. 3 %± 6. 1 %). 54. 1 % had evidence of some degree of diastolic dysfunction. 17. 6 % of subjects had evidence of right ventricular enlargement and 36. 5 % had right atrial enlargement. In univariate analysis RV wall thickness (β = - 68. 6; p =  0. 002), log right atrial area (β = - 297. 9; p =  0. 004), LV mass index (β = - 1. 3; p =  0. 03), E/E' ratio (β = - 5. 5; p =  0. 02), and degree of diastolic dysfunction (β = - 42. 8; p =  0. 006) were associated with <b>six</b> <b>minute</b> walk distance. After adjustment for co-variables, the associations between right atrial area (log right atrial area β = - 349. 8; p =  0. 003) and right ventricular wall thickness (β = - 43. 8; p =  0. 04) with lower <b>six</b> <b>minute</b> walk distance remained significant independent of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1). LV mass index, E/E' ratio, and degree of diastolic dysfunction were not independent predictors of <b>six</b> <b>minute</b> walk distance.

40|$|Objective—To {{examine the}} {{reproducibility}} and responsiveness to change of a <b>six</b> <b>minute</b> walk test and {{a quality of}} life measure in elderly patients with heart failure.  Design—Longitudinal within patient study.  Subjects— 60 patients with heart failure (mean age 82  years) attending a geriatric outpatient clinic, 45  of whom underwent a repeat assessment three to eight weeks later.  Main outcome measures—Subjects underwent a standardised <b>six</b> <b>minute</b> walk test and completed the chronic heart failure questionnaire (CHQ), a heart failure specific quality of life questionnaire. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated using a random effects one way analysis of variance {{as a measure of}} reproducibility. Guyatt's responsiveness coefficient and effect sizes were calculated as measures of responsiveness to change.  Results— 24 patients reported no major change in cardiac status, while seven had deteriorated and 14  had improved between the two clinic visits. Reproducibility was satisfactory (ICC >  0. 75) for the <b>six</b> <b>minute</b> walk test, for the total CHQ score, and for the dyspnoea, fatigue, and emotion domains of the CHQ. Effect sizes for all measures were large (>  0. 8), and responsiveness coefficients were very satisfactory (>  0. 7). Effect sizes for detecting deterioration were greater than those for detecting improvement.  Conclusions—Quality of life assessment and a <b>six</b> <b>minute</b> walk test are reproducible and responsive measures of cardiac status in frail, very elderly patients with heart failure.    Keywords: <b>six</b> <b>minute</b> walk;  elderly people;  heart failure;  quality of lif...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Several {{studies have}} shown that both {{objective}} and subjective measurements are related to exercise capacity in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In this study the relative contribution of lung function, maximal inspiratory pressure, dyspnoea, and quality of life to the performance in a walking distance test and a bicycle ergometer test was investigated. METHODS [...] Static lung volumes, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1), inspiratory slow vital capacity (IVC), transfer factor for carbon monoxide (TLCO) divided by the alveolar volume (TLCO/VA), static compliance (Cst), and maximal inspiratory peak pressure (PImaxPOES) were measured in 40 patients with COPD with severe airways obstruction (mean FEV 1 44 % predicted, mean FEV 1 /IVC 37 % predicted). Quality of life was assessed by the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) and dyspnoea by the Borg category scale. Exercise capacity was measured by both a <b>six</b> <b>minute</b> walking distance (test) and a maximal work load of the bicycle ergometer test (Wmax). RESULTS [...] Spirometric values and maximal inspiratory pressure were modestly correlated with both the <b>six</b> <b>minute</b> walking test and Wmax, r values ranging from 0. 50 to 0. 58. The TLCO was strongly correlated with the <b>six</b> <b>minute</b> walking test (r = 0. 62) and with Wmax (r = 0. 78). Quality of life showed no correlation with exercise capacity, while there was a correlation between dyspnoea and the <b>six</b> <b>minute</b> walking test (r = - 0. 41). Backward linear regression analysis selected TLCO and PImaxPOES as the most significant determinants for exercise performance. They explained 54 % and 69 % {{of the variance in the}} <b>six</b> <b>minute</b> walking test and Wmax, respectively. CONCLUSIONS [...] The results show that exercise capacity in patients with COPD with severe airways obstruction is more strongly related to inspiratory muscle strength and lung function than to dyspnoea and quality of life. The significant correlation between dyspnoea and the <b>six</b> <b>minute</b> walking test suggests that subjective variables are more strongly related to walking tests than to bicycle ergometer tests...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim was {{to develop}} a {{standardised}} and externally paced field walking test, incorporating an incremental and progressive structure, to assess functional capacity in patients with chronic airways obstruction. METHODS: The usefulness of two different shuttle walking test protocols was examined in two separate groups of patients. The initial 10 level protocol (group A, n = 10) and a subsequent, modified, 12 level protocol (group B, n = 10) differed in the number of increments and in the speeds of walking. Patients performed three shuttle walking tests one week apart. Then the performance of patients (group C, n = 15) in the <b>six</b> <b>minute</b> walking test was compared with that in the second (modified) shuttle walking test protocol. Heart rate was recorded during all the exercise tests with a short range telemetry device. RESULTS: The 12 level modified protocol provided a measure of functional capacity in patients {{with a wide range of}} disability and was reproducible after just one practice walk; the mean difference between trial 2 v 3 was - 2. 0 (95 % CI - 21. 9 to 17. 9) m. There was a significant relation between the distance walked in the <b>six</b> <b>minute</b> walking test and the shuttle walking test (rho = 0. 68) but the <b>six</b> <b>minute</b> walking test appeared to overestimate the extent of disability in some patients. The shuttle test provoked a graded cardiovascular response not evident in the <b>six</b> <b>minute</b> test. Moreover, the maximal heart rates attained were significantly higher for the shuttle walking test than for the <b>six</b> <b>minute</b> test. CONCLUSIONS: The shuttle walking test constitutes a standardised incremental field walking test that provokes a symptom limited maximal performance. It provides an objective measurement of disability and allows direct comparison of patients' performance...|$|R
