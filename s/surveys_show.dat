5|$|Deep sky <b>surveys</b> <b>show</b> that {{galaxies are}} {{often found in}} groups and clusters. Solitary galaxies that have not {{significantly}} interacted with another galaxy of comparable mass during the past billion years are relatively scarce. Only about 5% of the galaxies surveyed {{have been found to}} be truly isolated; however, these isolated formations may have interacted and even merged with other galaxies in the past, and may still be orbited by smaller, satellite galaxies. Isolated galaxies can produce stars at a higher rate than normal, as their gas is not being stripped by other nearby galaxies.|$|E
5|$|This {{model has}} Siletzia forming on the {{continental}} margin along {{what is now}} the Olympic-Wallowa Lineament (OWL; a zone of topographical features of unknown age and tectonic significance), with the southern end of Siletzia and the Klamath Mountains (joined to Siletzia) near the Idaho Batholith in central Idaho. Further evidence for this comes from the sand of the Tyee Formation that overlie the Roseburg Formation. Not only does this sand have the same isotopic composition of rock in the Idaho Batholith (and of sand now coursing down the Snake and Columbia Rivers), but it appears to have not been transported very far from its source. This implies that the Tyee Formation was much closer to the Idaho Batholith when it was deposited, and subsequently rotated away. Geodetic <b>surveys</b> <b>show</b> that the region continues to rotate, likely as a result of extension of the Basin and Range Province and asthenospheric flow around the southern edge of the subducting Juan de Fuca plate.|$|E

25|$|The Baltic Sea {{somewhat}} {{resembles a}} riverbed, with two tributaries, the Gulf of Finland and Gulf of Bothnia.

Several Pleistocene glacial episodes scooped out the river bed into the sea basin. By {{the time of the}} last, or Eemian Stage (MIS5e), the Eemian Sea was in place. Instead of a true sea, the Baltic can even today also be understood as the common estuary of all rivers flowing into it.|$|E

Geographic <b>surveys</b> <b>show</b> areas which have laterite stone alignments {{which may be}} foundations of temple sites that have not survived. The Khmer people constructed the Angkor monuments—which are widely distributed in Cambodia and Thailand—between the 9th and 13th centuries. The stone materials used were sandstone and laterite; brick {{had been used in}} monuments constructed in the 9th and 10th centuries. Two types of laterite can be identified; both types consist of the minerals kaolinite, quartz, hematite and goethite. Differences in the amounts of minor elements arsenic, antimony, vanadium and strontium were measured between the two laterites.|$|E
25|$|A 2010 {{systematic}} {{review of the}} Chinese-language literature found numerous acupuncture-related adverse events, including pneumothorax, fainting, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and infection as the most frequent, and cardiovascular injuries, subarachnoid hemorrhage, pneumothorax, and recurrent cerebral hemorrhage as the most serious, {{most of which were}} due to improper technique. Between 1980 and 2009, the Chinese-language literature reported 479 adverse events. Prospective <b>surveys</b> <b>show</b> that mild, transient acupuncture-associated adverse events ranged from 6.71% to 15%. In a study with 190,924 patients, the prevalence of serious adverse events was roughly 0.024%. Another study showed a rate of adverse events requiring specific treatment of 2.2%, 4,963 incidences among 229,230 patients. Infections, mainly hepatitis, after acupuncture are reported often in English-language research, though are rarely reported in Chinese-language research, making it plausible that acupuncture-associated infections have been underreported in China. Infections were mostly caused by poor sterilization of acupuncture needles. Other adverse events included spinal epidural hematoma (in the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine), chylothorax, injuries of abdominal organs and tissues, injuries in the neck region, injuries to the eyes, including orbital hemorrhage, traumatic cataract, injury of the oculomotor nerve and retinal puncture, hemorrhage to the cheeks and the hypoglottis, peripheral motor-nerve injuries and subsequent motor dysfunction, local allergic reactions to metal needles, stroke, and cerebral hemorrhage after acupuncture.|$|E
500|$|Seismicity in the south–central United States is {{moderately}} powerful. The {{energy from}} a mid-continent earthquake extends over {{as much as}} ten times area of a similarly sized earthquake in the western United States. A magnitude 4.0 earthquake west of the Rocky Mountains reaches up to [...] from its epicenter, while a magnitude 5.5 earthquake in the eastern US can be felt [...] from its epicenter. Science failed to explain the phenomena until 1978, when geologists discovered a massive fault line running {{from the middle of}} the continent to its eastern coast. More recent magnetic <b>surveys</b> <b>show</b> that the structure is a 500-million year-old strike-slip fault, which starts under the Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone and runs to the eastern coast. This corresponds to the strike-slip faulting exhibited in the Eastern Tennessee Zone, and explains the presence of mid-continent earthquakes in the United States. Still, it is not clear if the fault is definitely related to mid-continental seismicity.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the ways}} to measure {{economic}} competitiveness is by comparing an extent of economic freedom that countries have, which as <b>surveys</b> <b>show</b> can also largely explain differences in economic well-being across the world. [...] Generally, countries with higher economic freedom have higher gross domestic product per capita and its growth rates, as well as better health care, education quality, environment protection, income equality, and happiness results. These trends of increasing prosperity are confirmed even when we compare these indicators within territories of countries.|$|E

2500|$|Mercia's exact {{evolution}} at {{the start}} of the Anglo-Saxon era remains more obscure than that of Northumbria, Kent, or even Wessex. Mercia developed an effective political structure and adopted Christianity later than the other kingdoms. Archaeological <b>surveys</b> <b>show</b> that Angles settled the lands north of the River Thames by the 6th century. The name [...] "Mercia" [...] is Old English for [...] "boundary folk" [...] (see Welsh Marches), and the traditional interpretation is that the kingdom originated along the frontier between the native Welsh and the Anglo-Saxon invaders. However, P. Hunter Blair argued an alternative interpretation: that they emerged along the frontier between Northumbria and the inhabitants of the Trent river valley.|$|E
