[...] It uses {{the size of a}} storm, its intensity, its forward motion, and the topography of the coastal plain to estimate the depth of a storm surge at any individual grid point across the United States. [...] An accurate forecast track is required in order to produce accurate storm surge forecasts. [...] However, if the landfall point is uncertain, a maximum envelope of water (MEOW) map can be generated based on the direction of approach.

2500|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} are {{the strongest}} and stiffest materials yet discovered in terms of tensile strength and elastic modulus respectively. This strength results from the covalent sp2 bonds formed between the individual carbon atoms. In 2000, a multi-walled carbon nanotube was tested to have a tensile strength of [...] (For illustration, this translates into the ability to endure tension of a weight equivalent to [...] on a cable with cross-section of [...]) Further studies, such as one conducted in 2008, revealed that individual CNT shells have strengths of up to ≈, which is in agreement with quantum/atomistic models. Since carbon nanotubes have a low density for a solid of 1.3 to 1.4g/cm3, its <b>specific</b> <b>strength</b> of up to 48,000kN·m·kg−1 {{is the best of}} known materials, compared to high-carbon steel's 154kN·m·kg−1.|$|E

2500|$|Carbon fiber {{composite}} is an increasingly popular non-metallic material commonly used for bicycle frames. Although expensive, it is light-weight, corrosion-resistant and strong, {{and can be}} formed into almost any shape desired. The result is a frame that can be fine-tuned for <b>specific</b> <b>strength</b> where it is needed (to withstand pedaling forces), while allowing flexibility in other frame sections (for comfort). Custom carbon fiber bicycle frames may even be designed with individual tubes that are strong in one direction (such as laterally), while compliant in another direction (such as vertically). [...] The ability to design an individual composite tube with properties that vary by orientation cannot be accomplished with any metal frame construction commonly in production. Some carbon fiber frames use cylindrical tubes that are joined with adhesives and lugs, in a method somewhat analogous to a lugged steel frame. [...] Another type of carbon fiber frames are manufactured in a single piece, called monocoque construction.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the trial}} of the conspirators the {{prosecution}} stated that each bomber would board a plane with the [...] "necessary ingredients and equipment". They would then construct the devices mid-flight and detonate them. The hydrogen peroxide [...] would be placed in 500ml plastic bottles of the Oasis and Lucozade soft drinks. A sugary drink powder, Tang, would be mixed with the hydrogen peroxide to colour it to resemble a normal soft drink. Hydrogen peroxide is widely available for use as hair bleach and along with the other ingredients can become explosive if mixed to a <b>specific</b> <b>strength.</b> The mixture would be injected into the bottles with a syringe. The bottle's cap would not have been removed and the hole would have been resealed, thereby allowing the device to resemble a normal, unopened drink bottle when screened by airport security. The use of liquid explosives with dissolved powder is similar to the composition used in the 21 July 2005 London bombings, using hydrogen peroxide and chapatti flour, activated by a detonator.|$|E
50|$|The <b>specific</b> <b>{{strength}}</b> is a material's strength (force {{per unit}} area at failure) divided by its density.

5000|$|The hollow {{design of}} bird bones is {{multifunctional}} by establishing high <b>specific</b> <b>strength</b> and supplementing open airways {{to accommodate the}} skeletal pneumaticity common to many birds. The <b>specific</b> <b>strength</b> and resistance to buckling is optimized through their bone design that combines a thin, hard shell that encases a spongy core of trabeculae.

The Red-Tailed Hawk optimizes its weight with a repeating pattern of V-shaped struts that give the bones the necessary lightweight and stiff characteristics. The inner network of trabeculae shifts mass away from the neutral axis, which ultimately increases the resistance to buckling.|$|E
