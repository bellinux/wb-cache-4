40|$|Organizations talk a {{good game}} about strategy. But without the right {{projects}} and programs to carry them out, even the most forward-thinking strategies fail. To help bridge the chasm between high-level strategic vision and in-the-trenches implementation, many organizations turn to a project management office (PMO). “A strong PMO delivers two distinct areas of improvement to the organization, ” <b>says</b> <b>Greg</b> Wood, {{managing director of the}} corporate PMO for Rio Tinto, a metals and mining corporation and a PMI Global Executive Council member in Brisbane, Australia. “It helps organizations choose the right projects to deliver, and it helps them deliver projects correctly. ” It’s not enough for projects to come in on time and on budget. They must also be in sync with strategy, or “it’s just wasted capital, ” he says. Organizations continue to struggle: PMI’s Pulse of the Profession®: The High Cost of Low Performance found less than half (42 percent) of organizations report high alignment of projects to organizational strategy. 1 That’s simply not good enough in today’s hyper-volatile business world. Organizations must strike the right strategic response— and they must do it quickly. According to the 2014 PwC survey, at least three-quarters of CEOs acknowledge the need for change or are developing strategies for change in response to global forces. 2 A 2013 Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) report sponsored by PMI echoes the findings, with almost 90 percent of senior executives reporting that executing strategic initiatives is essential for their organization’s competitive advantage. Yet 61 percent admitted they struggle with executing on those strategies. Moreover, {{in the last three years}} an average of just 56 percent of strategic initiatives have been successful. 3 It’s a vicious and expensive cycle—one that PMOs can help prevent...|$|E
40|$|Themes and values? We’ve {{heard it}} all before, <b>says</b> <b>Greg</b> Barns ON 4 April a Sunday Age column by the doyen of Canberra {{political}} journalists, Michelle Grattan, contained this extraordinary passage: On a white board {{in the office of}} one of Latham’s advisers is the maxim ‘Never think in specific policies. Think in themes and values’. The adviser put it up there after Latham mused one day that this was the rule book of the ‘third way’ or ‘new politics’ What they mean is that a successful political strategy can’t be a series of one-dimensional policy announcements; specific policies are vital but in a sense secondary. They must mesh into a coherent story of themes and messages about the leader and what he wants to do. For example Labor’s $ 80 million Read Aloud Australia program is about more than educating kids. It’s part of defining the Latham persona, and reinforcing that he is committed to certain values. Latham has half-a-dozen themes: the ladder of opportunity, social responsibility, economic reform, national security, restoring communities, and the ‘new politics’. Michelle Grattan could never be called naive or partisan. But she seems to have left her ‘corporate knowledge’ of Australian politics at the door of Mr Latham’s office. Latham’s strategy of ‘themes and messages’ being primary and policies secondary is simply a replica of John Howard’s strategy in the lead-up to the 1996 election. Howard, like Latham now, was gun shy about putting out comprehensive policies as opposition leader because of what had happened to John Hewson in 1993. Hewson, it will be recalled, had the intellectual and personal integrity to put the most comprehensive package ever assembled by an opposition leader in Australia, the Fightback! policy. That integrity cost him the election and since then no opposition leader does anything more than Latham is doing now. To return to Howard. Grattan and her colleagues who are now starry eyed about Mr Latham will surely recall John Howard’s series of ‘headland’ speeches in 1995. One of these, delivered on 6 June that year, was a classic example of the ‘themes and values’ strategy that Latham and his ‘new politics’ disciples are claming as unique in Australian politics. There was, according to Mr Howard in this ‘headland speech’ entitled, ‘The Role of Government: A Modern Liberal Approach’, a frustrated mainstream in Australia today which sees government decisions increasingly driven by the noisy, self-interested clamour of powerful vested interests with scant regard for the national interest. The power of one mainstream has been diminished by this government’s reactions to the force of a few interest groups. Many Australians in the mainstream feel utterly powerless to compete with such groups, who seem to have the ear completely of the government on major issues. This bureaucracy of the new class is a world apart from the myriad of spontaneous, community-based organisations which have been {{part and parcel of the}} Australian mainstream for decades. These trends reflect a style of government which will change profoundly under the Liberal and National Parties. Under us, the views of all particular interests will be assessed against the national interest and the sentiments of mainstream Australia. For the past 12 years Labor has governed essentially by proxy through interest groups. Identification with a powerful interest group has been seen as the vehicle through which government largesse is delivered. Increasingly Australians have been exhorted to think of themselves as members of sub-groups. The focus so often has been on where we are different - not on what we have in common. In the process our sense of community has been severely damaged. In this one passage, John Howard set out the values and themes that the electorate could expect from him if they voted for him over Paul Keating in 1996. And this speech wasn’t the first time Howard had played the values and themes game, with policies being fitted around them. Once again, no doubt Ms Grattan would recall Future Directions, the 1988 document issued by Howard when he was opposition leader the first time. That document, with a family behind a picket fence on its front cover, was a cohesive attempt to provide market economics with a values system - a marriage of liberal economic themes with social conservatism. Future Directions argued that Australia was in an economic and social crisis - ordinary Australians’ living standards were in decline, corporatism, and particularly too powerful unions, were undermining our sense of well-being and our living standards. Privatisation, labour market deregulation, income tax cuts and a shift towards indirect taxation were featured policies. But Future Directions focused as much on the need to strengthen the traditional family unit, educational standards and an homogenous Australian culture, as it did on economic prescriptions. It argued that ‘average Australians’ do not feel secure and safe as they once used to. Why? Because governments have ‘devalued and dismissed’ religion and community pride. The ‘professional purveyors of guilt have attacked Australia’s heritage and people’ and there is not enough plain old common sense. The interest groups have imposed multiculturalism and aboriginal reconciliation on Australians, and Future Directions rather crudely helped to fuel that resentment. Michelle Grattan’s article is yet another example of Latham’s capacity to mesmerise even experienced Canberra journalists. The spin is working - ‘somehow Mark Latham is playing the opposition game differently and the government doesn’t know what to do with him’ is the line his staff want you to believe. Well, if you care to look at the modus operandi of the man Mr Latham hopes to replace as prime minister this year you might find that he’s not that different after all. John Howard has always been a ‘themes and values’ player and during his second period in opposition some of those journalists who are today claiming that Mr Latham is unique because Mr Howard is unable to deliver a knock out blow to him, used to say the same thing about Paul Keating’s inability to slay John Howard Plus ca change!
