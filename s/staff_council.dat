25|$|When the Japanese Defense Agency (JDA) and the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) {{were formed}} on 1 July 1954, the NSF and the Coastal Safety Force were {{restructured}} as the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF) and the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) respectively. The two Forces, {{together with the}} newly formed Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF), were the three major components of the JSDF. The Joint <b>Staff</b> <b>Council</b> (JSC) was also formed {{on top of the}} three Forces, with Hayashi becoming Chairman of JSC with rank of General, which was equivalent to Chief of the General Staff in other countries. The JSC served under the Director-General of JDA and Hayashi was responsible for assisting in formulating overall defense plans, supplies plans and training plans, as well as reviewing proposals as prepared by the Ground, Maritime and Air Staff Offices and operation directives as issued by the JSDF. Also, the JSC was responsible for defense-related intelligence and investigation work under his command.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the next}} 13 years, the Peter Jones {{business}} was not profitable – no dividends were paid to Lewis and the external shareholders [...] and in desperation, in 1914 Lewis appointed his son Spedan {{as chairman of}} Peter Jones. This gave Spedan Lewis complete control, and he decided that the underlying {{problem was that the}} staff had no incentive to do a good day's work, because their own interests were not in line with those of the business. He shortened their working day and instituted a system of commission for each department, paying selling staff amounts based on turnover. He held regular meetings at which staff could air any grievances directly with him. [...] In 1916, after a disagreement with his father, Spedan Lewis exchanged his 25 per cent interest in the Oxford Street business for Lewis's shares in Peter Jones Limited. He made improvements in staff conditions, including granting a third week's paid holiday each year. He had hot and cold running water installed in the staff bedrooms over the shop. In 1918, he started publishing a fortnightly newspaper telling staff how the business was faring. In 1919, he instituted a <b>staff</b> <b>council,</b> the first decision of which was that staff should be paid weekly instead of four-weekly. Business prospered: there was a profit of £20,000 in 1920. Spedan Lewis's radical idea was that the profits generated by business should not be paid solely to shareholders as a reward for their capital. Shareholders should receive a reasonable but limited return, and labour should be the recipient of the excess. His concept of 'fairer shares' involved sharing gain, knowledge and power. In 1920, Spedan started distributing Peter Jones preference shares to staff, who were now called 'Partners'.|$|E
2500|$|South Korea was {{considering}} the F-35, among several other competitors, for its F-X Phase III fighter program. South Korean officials had {{indicated that the}} F-35 would only be available for delivery after 2018, but Steve O'Bryan, Lockheed's vice president for F-35 business development, said that Lockheed can deliver the F-35 to South Korea by 2016. Some Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF) officers have oulined possible missions for the stealth fighter, such as surprise raids deep into nuclear armed North Korea. Lockheed has refused to allow ROKAF pilots access to the aircraft to test it prior to the selection, however simulations available to South Korea are more extensive than the processes used by other customers, such as Israel and Japan. In August 2013, the F-35 was essentially eliminated from the competition when the American foreign military sales process prevented Lockheed Martin from offering a price that did not exceed South Korea's budget for the program, leaving just the Boeing F-15SE Silent Eagle within the nation's budget. Lockheed Martin responded that it would work with the American government to continue to offer the F-35 to South Korea. The defense ministry rejected the award and said a new competition would be held to [...] "secure military capability in line with recent aviation technology developments." [...] In November 2013, the Korean Joint Chiefs of <b>Staff</b> <b>Council</b> recommended purchasing 40 F-35A as North Korea seemed to have difficulty dealing with radar-evading aircraft. On 27 January 2014, the Defense Acquisition Program Administration said that a contract for the 40 aircraft would be reviewed and, once approved, signed in September. With deliveries planned to begin in 2018, South Korea would benefit from the scale of F-35 production at the time. [...] With full-scale production having begun, the Unit Recurring Flyaway (URF) cost of one F-35A {{is expected to be}} $80–$85 million, which includes the aircraft, avionics and mission systems, the engine, logistics support, and a flight simulator. [...] Through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) agreement and past budget issues, the cost projection may be likely to rise. South Korea's formal selection of the F-35 purchase was finalized on 24 September 2014. [...] South Korea is the third FMS country to procure the F-35A after Israel and Japan.|$|E
