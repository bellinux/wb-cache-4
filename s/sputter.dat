5|$|Jupiter's {{extensive}} magnetosphere envelops its {{ring system}} and the orbits of all four Galilean satellites. Orbiting near the magnetic equator, these bodies serve as sources and sinks of magnetospheric plasma, while energetic particles from the magnetosphere alter their surfaces. The particles <b>sputter</b> off material from the surfaces and create chemical changes via radiolysis. The plasma's co-rotation with the planet means that the plasma preferably interacts with the moons' trailing hemispheres, causing noticeable hemispheric asymmetries. In addition, the large internal magnetic fields of the moons contribute to the Jovian magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|Ariel is {{the fourth}} largest of the Uranian moons, and may have the third {{greatest}} mass. The moon's density is 1.66g/cm3, which indicates that it consists of roughly equal parts water ice and a dense non-ice component. The latter could consist of rock and carbonaceous material including heavy organic compounds known as tholins. The presence of water ice is supported by infrared spectroscopic observations, which have revealed crystalline water ice {{on the surface of}} the moon. Water ice absorption bands are stronger on Ariel's leading hemisphere than on its trailing hemisphere. The cause of this asymmetry is not known, but it may be related to bombardment by charged particles from Uranus's magnetosphere, which is stronger on the trailing hemisphere (due to the plasma's co-rotation). The energetic particles tend to <b>sputter</b> water ice, decompose methane trapped in ice as clathrate hydrate and darken other organics, leaving a dark, carbon-rich residue behind.|$|E
30|$|For {{energies}} {{lower than}} 600 eV, no dot-like patterns are observed. In other words, the threshold energy for GaAs nanoscale dots formation is near 600 eV for 300 s Ar+ <b>sputtering.</b> Even though the threshold energy {{has so far}} eluded theoretical proof, its existence and characteristic can still be predicted and justified based on current <b>sputtering</b> theory. From what has been reported by Facsko et al. [10] and Bobek et al. [19], there exists an onset time to let the <b>sputtered</b> surface enter the early time QD formation regime at a fixed <b>sputtering</b> energy. This can be interpreted as: for a given <b>sputtering</b> time and varying <b>sputtering</b> energy, there exists the possibility that this <b>sputtering</b> duration is not long enough for some low <b>sputtering</b> energies to initiate dot formation, or these energies are below the threshold energy. <b>Sputtering</b> time and energy are two relative concepts. A shorter <b>sputtering</b> time could need higher <b>sputtering</b> energy {{to achieve the same}} outcome as in longer <b>sputtering</b> time but lower <b>sputtering</b> energy. Furthermore, by putting this temporal concept into the energy dependency, {{it is not difficult to}} conclude that in the ion induced diffusion regime, the ion energy against characteristic wavelength profile can be shifted by the <b>sputtering</b> time. With the same ion energy, longer <b>sputtering</b> time leads to smaller threshold energy and longer characteristic wavelength, yet the profile moves upwards.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sputtering</b> {{observed}} to occur below the threshold energy of physical <b>sputtering</b> is also often called chemical <b>sputtering.</b> The mechanisms behind such <b>sputtering</b> {{are not always}} well understood, and {{may be hard to}} distinguish from chemical etching. At elevated temperatures, chemical <b>sputtering</b> of carbon can be understood to be due to the incoming ions weakening bonds in the sample, which then desorb by thermal activation. The hydrogen-induced <b>sputtering</b> of carbon-based materials observed at low temperatures has been explained by H ions entering between C-C bonds and thus breaking them, a mechanism dubbed swift chemical <b>sputtering.</b>|$|R

Microscopic characteristics indicate that the <b>sputtering</b> power affects the film morphology: high <b>sputtering</b> powers lead to inhomogeneous domain-like patterns. The transition temperature from a metastable phase to a hexagonal phase decreased as the <b>sputtering</b> power increased. However, {{an analysis of the}} radial distribution functions indicates that the <b>sputtering</b> power did not have a distinct influence on the inner atomic structure of the amorphous phase.

5|$|The {{peculiar}} {{geometry of}} the Uranian system causes the moons' poles to receive more solar energy than their equatorial regions. Because the vapor pressure of CO2 is a steep function of temperature, this {{may lead to the}} accumulation of carbon dioxide in the low-latitude regions of Titania, where it can stably exist on high albedo patches and shaded regions of the surface in the form of ice. During the summer, when the polar temperatures reach as high as 85–90 K, carbon dioxide sublimates and migrates to the opposite pole and to the equatorial regions, giving rise to a type of carbon cycle. The accumulated carbon dioxide ice can be removed from cold traps by magnetospheric particles, which <b>sputter</b> it from the surface. Titania is thought to have lost a significant amount of carbon dioxide since its formation 4.6 billion years ago.|$|E
5|$|Umbriel is {{the third}} largest and fourth most massive of Uranian moons. The moon's density is 1.39g/cm3, which {{indicates}} that it mainly consists of water ice, with a dense non-ice component constituting around 40% of its mass. The latter could be made of rock and carbonaceous material including heavy organic compounds known as tholins. The presence of water ice is supported by infrared spectroscopic observations, which have revealed crystalline water ice {{on the surface of}} the moon. Water ice absorption bands are stronger on Umbriel's leading hemisphere than on the trailing hemisphere. The cause of this asymmetry is not known, but it may be related to the bombardment by charged particles from the magnetosphere of Uranus, which is stronger on the trailing hemisphere (due to the plasma's co-rotation).

5|$|Oberon is {{the second}} largest and most massive of the Uranian moons after Titania, and the ninth most massive moon in the Solar System. Oberon's density of 1.63g/cm³, which {{is higher than the}} typical density of Saturn's satellites, {{indicates}} that it consists of roughly equal proportions of water ice and a dense non-ice component. The latter could be made of rock and carbonaceous material including heavy organic compounds. The presence of water ice is supported by spectroscopic observations, which have revealed crystalline water ice {{on the surface of the}} moon. Water ice absorption bands are stronger on Oberon's trailing hemisphere than on the leading hemisphere. This is the opposite of what is observed on other Uranian moons, where the leading hemisphere exhibits stronger water ice signatures. The cause of this asymmetry is not known, but it may be related to impact gardening (the creation of soil via impacts) of the surface, which is stronger on the leading hemisphere. Meteorite impacts tend to <b>sputter</b> (knock out) ice from the surface, leaving dark non-ice material behind. The dark material itself may have formed as a result of radiation processing of methane clathrates or radiation darkening of other organic compounds.|$|E
50|$|The term {{electronic}} <b>sputtering</b> {{can mean}} either <b>sputtering</b> induced by energetic electrons (for example in a transmission electron microscope), or <b>sputtering</b> due to very high-energy or highly charged heavy ions that lose {{energy to the}} solid, mostly by electronic stopping power, where the electronic excitations cause <b>sputtering.</b> Electronic <b>sputtering</b> produces high <b>sputtering</b> yields from insulators, as the electronic excitations that cause <b>sputtering</b> are not immediately quenched, as {{they would be in}} a conductor.

40|$|Surface <b>sputtering</b> is {{explained}} theoretically {{by means of}} a 3 -body <b>sputtering</b> mechanism involving the ion and two surface atoms of the solid.

The theoretical <b>sputtering</b> rate S(E) was found experimentally to be proportional to the square of the difference between incident ion energy and the threshold energy for <b>sputtering</b> of surface atoms at low ion energies. Extrapolation of the theoretical <b>sputtering</b> formula to larger ion energies indicates that S(E) reaches a saturation value and finally decreases at high ion energies. The theoretical <b>sputtering</b> ratios S(E) for wolfram, tantalum, and molybdenum are compared with the corresponding experimental <b>sputtering</b> curves in the low energy region from threshold <b>sputtering</b> energy to 120 eV above the respective threshold energy.

25|$|OsO4 is {{a widely}} used {{staining}} agent used in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to provide contrast to the image. As a lipid stain, it is also useful in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) {{as an alternative to}} <b>sputter</b> coating. It embeds a heavy metal directly into cell membranes, creating a high electron scattering rate without the need for coating the membrane with a layer of metal, which can obscure details of the cell membrane. In the staining of the plasma membrane, osmium(VIII) oxide binds phospholipid head regions, thus creating contrast with the neighbouring protoplasm (cytoplasm). Additionally, osmium(VIII) oxide is also used for fixing biological samples in conjunction with HgCl2. Its rapid killing abilities are used to quickly kill live specimens such as protozoa. OsO4 stabilizes many proteins by transforming them into gels without destroying structural features. Tissue proteins that are stabilized by OsO4 are not coagulated by alcohols during dehydration. Osmium(VIII) oxide is also used as a stain for lipids in optical microscopy. OsO4 also stains the human cornea (see safety considerations).|$|E

25|$|Pulsed laser {{deposition}} is {{only one}} of many thin film deposition techniques. Other methods include molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), <b>sputter</b> deposition (RF, magnetron, and ion beam). The history of laser-assisted film growth started soon after the technical realization of the first laser in 1960 by Maiman. Smith and Turner utilized a ruby laser to deposit the first thin films in 1965, three years after Breech and Cross studied the laser-vaporization and excitation of atoms from solid surfaces. However, the deposited films were still inferior to those obtained by other techniques such as chemical vapor deposition and molecular beam epitaxy. In the early 1980s, a few research groups (mainly in the former USSR) achieved remarkable results on manufacturing of thin film structures utilizing laser technology. The breakthrough came in 1987 when Dijkkamp, Xindi Wu and Venkatesan were able to laser deposit a thin film of YBa2Cu3O7, a high temperature superconductive material, which was of superior quality to that of films deposited with alternative techniques. Since then, the technique of pulsed laser deposition has been utilized to fabricate high quality crystalline films, such as doped garnet thin films for use as planar waveguide lasers. The deposition of ceramic oxides, nitride films, metallic multilayers and various superlattices has been demonstrated. In the 1990s the development of new laser technology, such as lasers with high repetition rate and short pulse durations, made PLD a very competitive tool for the growth of thin, well defined films with complex stoichiometry.|$|E
