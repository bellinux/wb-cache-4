5|$|During the {{following}} decade, CMB anisotropies were further investigated {{by a large}} number of ground-based and balloon experiments. In 2000–2001 several experiments, most notably BOOMERanG, found the shape of the universe to be spatially almost flat by measuring the typical angular size (the size on the <b>sky)</b> <b>of</b> the anisotropies.|$|E
5|$|The {{storyboard}} {{took six}} months to complete. Kamei struggled with several difficulties as he was under pressure due to how it would influence the entire film. The climax of the film also proved difficult to make. He also noted how the first scene had the challenge of attracting the audience's attention. Kamei's favorite scene is when Yuri {{looks up at the}} <b>sky</b> <b>of</b> Shizontania the night before the knights' expedition to the old ruins. It meant to emphasize the importance of Yuri's decision in regards to his future.|$|E
5|$|With {{a visual}} {{magnitude}} of 17.3, Haumea is the third-brightest {{object in the}} Kuiper belt after Pluto and , and easily observable with a large amateur telescope. However, because the planets and most small Solar System bodies share a common orbital alignment from their formation in the primordial disk of the Solar System, most early surveys for distant objects focused on the projection on the <b>sky</b> <b>of</b> this common plane, called the ecliptic. As the region of sky close to the ecliptic became well explored, later sky surveys began looking for objects that had been dynamically excited into orbits with higher inclinations, {{as well as more}} distant objects, with slower mean motions across the sky. These surveys eventually covered the location of Haumea, with its high orbital inclination and current position far from the ecliptic.|$|E

Arcturus would appear as roughly magnitude -5.2 (about 120 times brighter than it appears from Earth, or close to twice the brightness of Venus) in the night <b>sky</b> <b>of</b> a hypothetical planet orbiting Eta Boötis, while Eta Boötis would appear at about magnitude 2.4 (absolute magnitude 2.41 at 0.99 parsec) in the <b>sky</b> <b>of</b> a hypothetical planet orbiting Arcturus, or over twice the brightness of Sirius in the night sky.|$|E

Some areas host local stage story telling called Hari Katha. Some areas may put a huge Narakasura dummy made with fireworks. This will be burst by a person dressed as Lord Krishna or, more accurately, a costume of Satyabhama, the consort of Lord Krishna, who actually killed the demon Narakasura; an event that is celebrated as Diwali for generations.

25|$|In 2010, Penrose {{reported}} possible evidence, {{based on}} concentric circles found in WMAP {{data of the}} CMB <b>sky,</b> <b>of</b> an earlier universe existing before the Big Bang of our own present universe. He mentions this evidence in the epilogue of his 2010 book Cycles of Time, a book in which he presents his reasons, to do with Einstein's field equations, the Weyl curvature C, and the Weyl curvature hypothesis, that the transition at the Big Bang could have been smooth enough for a previous universe to survive it. He made several conjectures about C and the WCH, {{some of which were}} subsequently proved by others, and the smoothness is real, and where he also popularized his conformal cyclic cosmology (CCC) theory.|$|E
25|$|Meri's travel book of {{his journey}} to the {{northeast}} passage, Virmaliste Väraval (At the Gate of the Northern Lights) (1974), won him huge success in the Soviet Union. It was translated into Finnish in 1977 in the Soviet Writers series, which also introduced to Finnish readers works by the Estonian writers Mats Traat, Lilli Promet, and Ülo Tuulik. In the book Meri combined the present with a perspective into history, and used material from such explorers as Cook, Forster, Wrangel, Dahl, Sauer, Middendorff, Cochran, and others. When he sees a mountain rising against the stormy <b>sky</b> <b>of</b> the Bering Strait, he realizes that Vitus Bering and James Cook had looked at the same mountain, but {{from the other side}} of the strait.|$|E
25|$|Diffuse sky {{radiation}} is solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface {{after having been}} scattered from the direct solar beam by molecules or suspensoids in the atmosphere. It is also called skylight, diffuse skylight, or {{sky radiation}} and {{is the reason for}} changes in the color of the <b>sky.</b> <b>Of</b> the total light removed from the direct solar beam by scattering in the atmosphere (approximately 25% of the incident radiation when the sun is high in the sky, depending on the amount of dust and haze in the atmosphere), about two-thirds ultimately reaches the earth as diffuse sky radiation. When the sun is at the zenith in a cloudless sky, with 1361W/m2 above the atmosphere, direct sunlight is about 1050W/m2, and total insolation about 1120W/m2. This implies that under these conditions the diffuse radiation is only about 70W/m2 out of the original 1361W/m2.|$|E

25|$|In 1747, the Durrani kingdom was {{established}} by a Pakhtun general, Ahmad Shah Abdali, and included Balochistan, Peshawar, Daman, Multan, Sindh, and Punjab. In the south, a succession of autonomous dynasties (the Daudpotas, Kalhoras and Talpurs) had asserted the independence of Sind, {{from the end of}} Aurangzeb's reign. The first time Ahmad Shah invaded Hindustan, the Mughal imperial army checked his advance successfully. Yet subsequent events led to a double alliance, one by marriage and another politically, between the Afghan King and the Mughal Emperor. The battle of Panipat was the effect of this political alliance. After the victory of Panipat, Ahmad Shah Durrani actually was Shahan Shah not only of Afghanistan but even of Hindustan, when the lawful Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II could not strike coin bearing his name nor order the Khutba to be read in his name before Ahmad Shah allowed him to do so. The influence of Durrani monarch continued in Northern India up to his death. All the eyes were always turned towards Afghanistan whenever a new danger appeared on the political <b>sky</b> <b>of</b> Hindustan.|$|E

500|$|As on Hounds of Love (1985), {{the album}} {{is divided into two}} sections, each with its own theme and mood. The first disc, subtitled A Sea of Honey, {{features}} a set of unrelated themed songs, including [...] "King of the Mountain"; [...] "Bertie", a Renaissance-style ode to her son; and [...] "Joanni", based on the story of Joan of Arc. In the song [...] "", Bush sings 117 digits of the number Pi, but misses 22 digits from the 80th to the 101st place of the value of pi. The second disc, subtitled A <b>Sky</b> <b>of</b> Honey, features one continuous piece of music describing the experience of being outdoors after waking at dawn, moving through afternoon, dusk, to night, then back to the following dawn of a single summer's day. All the pieces in this suite refer or allude to sky and sea in their lyrical content. Bush mixed her voice with cooing woodpigeons to repeat the phrases [...] "A sea of honey, a <b>sky</b> <b>of</b> honey", and [...] "You're full of beauty" [...] throughout the piece, and uses recordings of actual birdsong throughout. A <b>Sky</b> <b>of</b> Honey features Rolf Harris playing the didgeridoo on one track, and providing vocals on [...] "The Painter's Link". Other artists making guest appearances on the album include Peter Erskine, Eberhard Weber, Lol Creme, and Gary Brooker. Two tracks feature string arrangements by Michael Kamen, performed by the London Metropolitan Orchestra. A CD release of the single [...] "King of the Mountain" [...] included a cover of [...] "Sexual Healing" [...] by Marvin Gaye.|$|E
