5|$|Despite the <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> fifth album, the duo Simon & Garfunkel {{decided to}} part company, announcing their {{break-up}} later that year. They have nonetheless {{made a number}} of reunion performances, including a free concert in New York City's Central Park in 1981, which drew a crowd of half-a-million people and resulted in the live album The Concert in Central Park.|$|E

5|$|The <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> third album, Tragic Kingdom, {{led to an}} {{interest}} by fans in the band's earlier albums, No Doubt and The Beacon Street Collection, and many more copies of them were manufactured and sold. The Beacon Street Collection was re-released in October 1997 {{as part of the}} band's back catalog and, by the summer of 1997, No Doubt had sold 250,000 copies.|$|E
5|$|After McCoy {{told them}} they were the Miami Showband, Thomas Crozier (who had a notebook) asked the band members for their names and addresses, while the others bantered with them about the <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> {{performance}} that night. As Crozier took down the information, a car pulled up and another uniformed man appeared on the scene. He wore a uniform and beret noticeably different from the others. He spoke with an educated English accent and immediately took charge, ordering a man who {{appeared to have been}} the leader of the patrol, to tell Crozier to obtain their names and dates of birth instead of addresses.|$|E
5|$|Audition was {{originally}} {{started by the}} Japanese company Omega Project, who {{wanted to make a}} horror film after the great financial <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> previous production Ring. To create the film, the company purchased the rights to Ryu Murakami's book Audition, and hired screenwriter Daisuke Tengan and director Miike to film an adaptation. The cast and crew consisted primarily of people Miike had worked with on previous projects, with the exception of Shiina, who had worked as a model prior to beginning a career in film. The film was shot in about three weeks in Tokyo.|$|E

50|$|In the First Punic War, Catania {{was one of}} {{the first}} among the cities of Sicily, which made their {{submission}} to the Roman Republic, after the first <b>successes</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> arms in 263 BC. The expression of Pliny (vii. 60) who represents it as having been taken by Valerius Messalla, is certainly a mistake.|$|R
50|$|The Old Girls' and Old Boys' Association is a {{thriving}} global community. The Association organises regular reunions and events, keeps former pupils informed of current {{events at the}} school and <b>of</b> the <b>successes</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> peers, and often invites Old Boys and Old Girls back to the school to share their expertise and life experiences with current pupils.|$|R
5|$|Critical {{reception}} to Dynamite Headdy was positive. Critics {{highlighted the}} game's originality and creativity in distinguishing it among other {{games in the}} action-platform genre. They also commended Treasure for demonstrating their technical expertise with impressive graphical effects and building on the <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> earlier game Gunstar Heroes (1993). In reviews from the time and in retrospect, Dynamite Headdy is cited for {{being one of the}} best games on the Genesis. An 8-bit port was released for Game Gear, which itself served as the basis for a Master System port released exclusively in Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Following on {{from the}} <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> debut album, they {{released}} Talk on Corners and In Blue in 1997 and 2000 respectively. Originally Talk on Corners met with lukewarm success, until a remix version was released, when it topped the charts in many countries, and reached platinum status in the United Kingdom and Australia. In Blue moved towards mainstream pop, placing heavy emphasis on electronic synthesisers. It was successful, and was No. 1 in its first sales week in the UK, Ireland, Australia, Germany, Switzerland, and Austria and debuted at No. 2 in France and Norway. It {{climbed to the top}} position during its second week in Sweden and Spain.|$|E
5|$|Following the <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> {{debut album}} Robbers & Cowards and {{spending}} {{the rest of}} 2007 touring across North America and Europe, the band started recording new material for their next album {{over the course of}} four months. Taking its title from the paper of the same name by American philosopher Josiah Royce, Loyalty to Loyalty carries a darker tone than its previous album by having a more experimental sound throughout and songs that deal with philosophies and politics, including suicide, crisis of faith, public security and job satisfaction.|$|E
5000|$|Big in Japan was a punk {{band that}} emerged from Liverpool, England in the late 1970s. They are better known for the later <b>successes</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> band members than for their own music. According to the Liverpool Echo, Big in Japan were [...] "a {{supergroup}} with a difference - its members only became super after they left." ...|$|R
5000|$|He was {{primarily}} a historian of institutions, like medieval universities and governments. His works reflect the mostly twentieth-century optimistic, liberal view that progressive government by [...] "the best and brightest" [...] {{is the way to}} go. His histories of medieval Europe's institutions stress the efficiency and <b>successes</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> governing bureaucracies, implicitly analogous to those of modern nation states.|$|R
25|$|His films' cheerful, unpretentious appeal {{make them}} the direct {{descendants}} of those made a generation earlier by George Formby. Never highly thought {{of by the}} critics, they were very popular with domestic audiences and Wisdom's films were among Britain's biggest box-office <b>successes</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> day. They were also successful in some unlikely overseas markets, helping Rank stay afloat financially when their more expensive film projects were unsuccessful.|$|R
5|$|Historian Nancy Bristow {{has argued}} that the pandemic, when {{combined}} with the increasing number of women attending college, contributed to the success of women in the field of nursing. This was {{due in part to the}} failure of medical doctors, who were predominantly men, to contain and prevent the illness. Nursing staff, who were predominantly women, felt more inclined to celebrate the <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> patient care and less inclined to identify the spread of the disease with their own work.|$|E
5|$|In May 1981, Paramount Pictures {{acquired}} the film rights, with Stigwood attached as a producer. Paramount allocated {{a budget of}} $15 million, and the film was scheduled to go into production by year-end. To avoid higher production costs, Stigwood, Rice and Lloyd Webber each agreed to take a smaller salary but {{a higher percentage of}} the film's gross. Stigwood hired Ken Russell to direct the film, based on the <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> previous collaboration, Tommy (1975).|$|E
5|$|Pokémon Gold and Silver were {{critically}} acclaimed upon release {{and they are}} {{considered by many to}} be the best games in the entire series, as well as some of the fifth generation console gaming's most significant titles. They continued the enormous <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> predecessors as Pokémon began to form into a multi-billion dollar franchise. The games almost matched the sales of Pokémon Red and Blue and went on to jointly sell millions of copies worldwide. By 2010, the recorded sales of Gold and Silver were at 23 million units.|$|E
50|$|Folk Music is {{the seventh}} studio album by English {{acoustic}} roots duo Show of Hands. After the <b>successes</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> 1996 Royal Albert Hall performance and their subsequent album Dark Fields (1997), the duo decided {{to record a}} limited edition album featuring the duo's renditions of traditional folk music. It was recorded in September 1998 as a project to connect the band to their roots.|$|R
50|$|Having {{encountered}} {{pressure from}} the mainstream <b>successes</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> first two albums, the band self-imposed a 10-month hiatus. During then, they established the Treehouse Productions where they would help the needy children suffering from mental and physical illnesses through music. In the process, other music acts eventually signed up for Treehouse Productions to help the band achieve their objectives, such as Rico Blanco and Mayonnaise.|$|R
5000|$|Some far-right {{critics argue}} that neo-Nazis joining the national-anarchist {{movement}} will lead to them losing credit for the <b>successes</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> [...] "anti-Zionist" [...] struggle if it is co-opted by left-wing anarchists. They further argue that national-anarchists want the militant chic of calling themselves [...] "anarchists" [...] without the historical and philosophical baggage that accompanies such a claim, such as the link with 19th-century Jewish anarchists.|$|R
5|$|Since its release, Kadhalikka Neramillai has {{developed}} a cult status in Tamil cinema. It has been hailed as a trendsetting comedy, and the film is said to kindle a feeling of joie de vivre. The film's comedy sequences are regarded as evergreen. The <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> on-screen pairing led Nagesh and Sachu to act together in films such as Motor Sundaram Pillai (1966), Galatta Kalyanam (1968), Sivandha Mann (1969) Sumathi En Sundari (1971) and Urimai Kural (1974). According to The News Today, Kadhalikka Neramillai also popularised the romantic comedy genre.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} Virginia Tech's kickoff, the California offense {{returned to}} the field. The Bears were unable to repeat the <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> first drive and went three and out, punting the ball back to Virginia Tech. The Hokies recovered the ball at their 43-yard line and moved quickly. Bryan Randall completed a 53-yard pass to receiver Chris Shreve. Two plays later, Randall completed a three-yard touchdown pass that gave the Hokies a 14–7 lead with 2:40 remaining in the quarter. California received the ball after the touchdown, but again went three and out. As before, the Hokies struck quickly. After starting from the California 49-yard line, it took one play for Virginia Tech to score. Randall completed a long pass to quarterback Marcus Vick, {{who came into the}} game as a wide receiver. The score and extra point made the game 21–7 with 50seconds left in the quarter. California received the kickoff and ran three quick plays {{before the end of the}} quarter. As time expired, California faced a fourth down and nine yards from their 36-yard line and was preparing to punt. With one quarter elapsed, Virginia Tech led, 21–7.|$|E
5|$|Although Beebe {{attempted}} {{to ensure that}} Barton would receive credit as the Bathysphere's inventor and Beebe's fellow diver, the popular media tended to ignore Barton and pay attention only to Beebe. Barton was often resentful of this, believing Beebe to be deliberately hogging the fame. Beebe in turn lacked patience for Barton's unpredictable moods, and felt that Barton did not display the proper respect for the natural world. Still, Beebe and Barton both had something the other needed: Beebe for {{his experience as a}} marine biologist, and Barton for his mechanical skill. Out of pragmatic concern for the <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> dives, they managed to resolve their disagreements well enough to work together at Nonsuch Island, although they did not remain on good terms afterwards.|$|E

50|$|Following the <b>successes</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> earlier comic operas, The Emerald Isle and Merrie England, Basil Hood and Edward German collaborated once more. Despite a good {{reception}} from {{critics and}} Savoy opera devotees, the opera achieved {{a run of}} only 115 performances, owing partly to its dense plot and unwieldy libretto, and partly to the continued decline of comic operas in favour of George Edwardes-style musical comedies as the London theatregoing public's choice entertainment.|$|R
50|$|Utopia, Limited; or, The Flowers of Progress, is a Savoy opera, {{with music}} by Arthur Sullivan and {{libretto}} by W. S. Gilbert. It was the second-to-last of Gilbert and Sullivan's fourteen collaborations, premiering on 7 October 1893 {{for a run}} of 245 performances. It did not achieve the <b>success</b> <b>of</b> most <b>of</b> <b>their</b> earlier productions.|$|R
5|$|Each team {{received}} a bye {{to the third}} round of the tournament, and then progressed through five rounds before reaching the final. Arsenal were in a successful phase, with this final following recent First Division titles, while Sheffield United were attempting to emulate the <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> rivals Sheffield Wednesday in the tournament the year before. A closely fought first half was followed by a dominant second half by Arsenal, who won by a single goal, scored by Ted Drake in the 74th minute. A media ban by the stadium's bosses caused reporters to fly above the stadium in autogyros to see the match and the BBC experimented with sports commentators for the first time during its live broadcast of the final.|$|E
5|$|Flood was They Might Be Giants' first {{release on}} any major label. Elektra Records {{approached}} the band following the unexpected <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> second album, Lincoln, which {{was released on}} the independent Bar/None label. The record deal that Elektra presented was {{largely due to the}} work of Susan Drew, an A worker who had been following the band since 1986. Because of her confidence, the band was given an extensive level of creative control over their projects, in addition to the ability {{to take advantage of the}} label's strategies and resources. Although They Might Be Giants recorded the album as a duo, they were joined by many guest musicians on brass and string instruments. The band also enlisted Alan Bezozi to help program some of the drums for the album.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1980s, {{following}} the <b>success</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> isometric Filmation game engine behind titles like Knight Lore, the Stampers founded a separate company: Rare Designs of the Future, later shortened to Rare. While Ultimate {{was built for}} the British home microcomputer market, Rare was founded {{with an eye toward}} the burgeoning Japanese video game console market, having been apprised of Nintendo by their Japanese arcade industry contacts. Nintendo initially rebuffed the brothers' interest in 1983, which led Chris Stamper to study the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) hardware for six months. The brothers flew to Kyoto to present software samples to Nintendo executives. Nintendo purchased the Stampers' Slalom, which sold half a million units, and made the Stampers into Nintendo's first Western third-party developer. As interest in Filmation and the Spectrum began to wane, the brothers sold part of Ultimate to U.S. Gold and began to focus on Rare, though the Stampers retained a majority stake in Ultimate.|$|E
