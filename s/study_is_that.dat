5|$|Ecology is {{the study}} of the {{distribution}} and abundance of living organisms, the interaction between them and their environment. An organism shares an environment that includes other organisms and biotic factors as well as local abiotic factors (non-living) such as climate and ecology. One reason that biological systems can be difficult to <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> so many different interactions with other organisms and the environment are possible, even on small scales. A microscopic bacterium responding to a local sugar gradient is responding to its environment as much as a lion searching for food in the African savanna. For any species, behaviors can be co-operative, competitive, parasitic, or symbiotic. Matters become more complex when two or more species interact in an ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|Only {{recently}} have attempts to improve {{health in the}} developing world concentrated on not only physical illness but also mental health. Deliberate self-harm is common {{in the developing world}}. Research into self-harm in the developing world is however still very limited although an important case <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of Sri Lanka, which is a country exhibiting a high incidence of suicide and self-poisoning with agricultural pesticides or natural poisons. Many people admitted for deliberate self-poisoning during a study by Eddleston et al. were young and few expressed a desire to die, but death was relatively common in the young in these cases. The improvement of medical management of acute poisoning in the developing world is poor and improvements are required in order to reduce mortality.|$|E
25|$|Another {{factor that}} makes {{periodontitis}} a difficult disease to <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> human host response can also affect the alveolar bone resorption.

25|$|It can be {{seen from}} the {{modeling}} above, the main assumption of the twin <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of equal environments, also known as the equal environments assumption.

30|$|The {{central point}} of this <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> we {{assessed}} all critical care providers (physicians, nurses, nurse technicians and respiratory therapists) from both ICU and SDU to evaluate the prevalence of burnout syndrome and moral distress, and their association.

25|$|An {{observation}} of the Datta <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the learning group spent 180% more time in SWS than did the control group during the post-trial sleep-recording session. This study shows that after spatial exploration activity, patterns of hippocampal place cells are reactivated during SWS following the experiment. Rats were run through a linear track using rewards on either end. The rats would then {{be placed in the}} track for 30 minutes to allow them to adjust (PRE), then they ran the track with reward-based training for 30 minutes (RUN), and then they were allowed to rest for 30 minutes.|$|E
500|$|One {{criticism}} to the UCS <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the analysis}} was made using average emissions rates across regions instead of marginal generation {{at different times}} of the day. The former approach {{does not take into account}} the generation mix within interconnected electricity markets and shifting load profiles throughout the day. An analysis by three economist affiliated with the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), published in November 2014, developed a methodology to estimate marginal emissions of electricity demand that vary by location and time of day across the United States. The marginal analysis, applied to plug-in electric vehicles, found that the emissions of charging PEVs vary by region and hours of the day. In some regions, such as the Western U.S. and Texas, [...] emissions per mile from driving PEVs are less than those from driving a hybrid car. However, in other regions, such as the Upper Midwest, charging during the recommended hours of midnight to 4 a.m. implies that PEVs generate more emissions per mile than the average car currently on the road. The results show a fundamental tension between electricity load management and environmental goals as the hours when electricity is the least expensive to produce tend to be the hours with the greatest emissions. This occurs because coal-fired units, which have higher emission rates, are most commonly used to meet base-level and off-peak electricity demand; while natural gas units, which have relatively low emissions rates, are often brought online to meet peak demand.|$|E
500|$|Misuse, problem use, abuse, {{and heavy}} {{use of alcohol}} refer to {{improper}} use of alcohol which may cause physical, social, or moral harm to the drinker. Moderate use is defined by The Dietary Guidelines for Americans as {{no more than two}} alcoholic beverages a day for men and no more than one alcoholic beverage a day for women. Some drinkers may drink more than 600 ml of alcohol per day during a heavy drinking period. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) defines binge drinking as the amount of alcohol leading to a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.08, which, for most adults, would be reached by consuming five drinks for men or four for women over a two-hour period. According to the NIAAA, men may be at risk for alcohol-related problems if their alcohol consumption exceeds 14 standard drinks per week or 4 drinks per day, and women may be at risk if they have more than 7 standard drinks per week or 3 drinks per day. It defines a standard drink as one 12-ounce bottle of beer, one 5-ounce glass of wine, or 1.5ounces of distilled spirits. Despite this risk, a 2014 report in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that only 10% of either [...] "heavy drinkers" [...] or [...] "binge drinkers" [...] defined according to the above criteria also met the criteria for alcohol dependence, while only 1.3% of non-binge drinkers met the criteria. An inference drawn from this <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> evidence-based policy strategies and clinical preventive services may effectively reduce binge drinking without requiring addiction treatment in most cases.|$|E

500|$|Assuming {{that not}} only humans but even some non-mammalian species are conscious, a number of {{evolutionary}} approaches {{to the problem of}} neural correlates of consciousness open up. For example, assuming that birds are conscious — a common assumption among neuroscientists and ethologists due to the extensive cognitive repertoire of birds — there are comparative neuroanatomical ways to validate some of the principal, currently competing, mammalian consciousness–brain theories. The rationale for such a comparative <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the avian brain deviates structurally from the mammalian brain. So how similar are they? What homologues can be identified? The general conclusion from the study by Butler, et al., {{is that some of the}} major theories for the mammalian brain [...] also appear to be valid for the avian brain. The structures assumed to be critical for consciousness in mammalian brains have homologous counterparts in avian brains. Thus the main portions of the theories of Crick and Koch, Edelman and Tononi, and Cotterill [...] seem [...] to be compatible with the assumption that birds are conscious. Edelman also differentiates between what he calls primary consciousness (which is a trait shared by humans and non-human animals) and higher-order consciousness as it appears in humans alone along with human language capacity. Certain aspects of the three theories, however, seem less easy to apply to the hypothesis of avian consciousness. For instance, the suggestion by Crick and Koch that layer 5 neurons of the mammalian brain have a special role, seems difficult to apply to the avian brain, since the avian homologues have a different morphology. Likewise, the theory of Eccles seems incompatible, since a structural homologue/analogue to the dendron has not been found in avian brains. The assumption of an avian consciousness also brings the reptilian brain into focus. The reason is the structural continuity between avian and reptilian brains, meaning that the phylogenetic origin of consciousness may be earlier than suggested by many leading neuroscientists.|$|E

2500|$|The reduced size {{of brain}} {{structures}} associated with memory and attention was also noted through {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI), a process used to produce images of the brain for observation. [...] For example, those with prenantal meth exposure had, on average, a smaller hippocampus (a brain structure involved in many things, including memory) than control participants. This reduction in size was correlated with poorer sustained attention (decreased ability {{to focus on a}} single task for a period of time) and delayed verbal memory (memory of words read or heard). The conclusion from this <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> prenatal meth exposure can be neurotoxic to the developing fetus brain.|$|E

2500|$|The {{limitation}} that Diamond admits in her <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> she {{had only}} one Einstein to compare with 11 brains of normal intelligence individuals. S. S. Kantha of the Osaka Bioscience Institute criticized Diamond's study, as did Terence Hines of Pace University. Other issues related to Diamond's study point out glial cells continue dividing as a person ages and although Einstein's brain was 76, it was compared to brains that averaged 64 in age (eleven male brains, 47–80 years of age). Diamond in her landmark study [...] "On the Brain of a Scientist: Albert Einstein" [...] noted that the 11 male individuals whose brains were used in her control base had died from nonneurologically related diseases. She also noted that [...] "Chronological age {{is not necessarily a}} useful indicator in measuring biological systems. Environmental factors also play a strong role in modifying the conditions of the organism. One major problem in dealing with human specimens is that they do not come from controlled environments." [...] Additionally, there is little information regarding the samples of brains that Einstein's brain was compared against such as IQ score, or other relevant factors. Diamond also admitted that research disproving the study was omitted. [...] His brain is now at the Mütter Museum in Philadelphia and two of the 140 sections are on loan at the British Museum.|$|E
