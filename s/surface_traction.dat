30|$|To a great extent, at {{the onset}} of decohesion in a bonded joint the <b>surface</b> <b>tractions</b> between the joined adherends do not {{suddenly}} drop to zero owing to the presence of low-range interactions that precede the formation of traction-free surfaces. Such interactions can be effectively described by allowing jumps in the displacement field along an interface where crack propagation is known or is expected to occur. At each point of the interface such displacement discontinuities have then to be related to <b>surface</b> <b>tractions</b> components via a decohesion model, i.e. a relationship able of representing the different phases of the potential debonding process from the initial undamaged condition to progressive damage and up to fracture propagation. The driving idea for such a class of models is the cohesive-zone concept initially introduced by Barenblatt [3] and Dugdale [4]. This approach has gained major popularity in recent years for simulating delamination, debonding, fracture and fragmentation via finite element methods and is ideally suited for simulating adhesive joints, the potential crack paths being generally known in advance in most cases, see e.g. [5, 6] and references therein for recent survey accounts.|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a family of}} linearly elastic shells with thickness 2 ε (where ε is a small parameter). The shells are clamped along {{a portion of their}} lateral face, all having the same middle surface S, and may enter in contact with a rigid foundation along the bottom face. We are interested in studying the limit behavior of both the three-dimensional problems, given in curvilinear coordinates, and their solutions (displacements of covariant components u_i^ε) when ε tends to zero. To do that, we use asymptotic analysis methods. On one hand, we find that if the applied body force density is O(1) with respect to ε and <b>surface</b> <b>tractions</b> density is O(ε), a suitable approximation of the variational formulation of the contact problem is a two-dimensional variational inequality which can be identified as the variational formulation of the obstacle problem for an elastic membrane. On the other hand, if the applied body force density is O(ε^ 2) and <b>surface</b> <b>tractions</b> density is O(ε^ 3), the corresponding approximation is a different two-dimensional inequality which can be identified as the variational formulation of the obstacle problem for an elastic flexural shell. We finally discuss the existence and uniqueness of solution for the limit two-dimensional variational problems found.
