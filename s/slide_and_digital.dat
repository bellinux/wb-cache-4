40|$|Background: The use {{of digital}} whole slide imaging for human {{epidermal}} growth factor receptor 2 (HER 2) immunohistochemistry (IHC) could create improvements in workflow and performance, allowing for central archiving of specimens, distributed and remote interpretation, {{and the potential for}} additional computerized automation. Procedures: The accuracy, precision, and reproducibility of manual digital interpretation for HER 2 IHC were determined by comparison to manual glass slide interpretation. Inter- and intra-pathologist reproducibility and precision between the glass <b>slide</b> <b>and</b> <b>digital</b> interpretations of HER 2 IHC were determined in 5 studies using DAKO HercepTest-stained breast cancer slides with the Philips Digital Pathology System. In 2 inter-method studies, 3 pathologists interpreted glass and digital slides in sequence or in random order with a minimum of 7 days as a washout period. These studies also measured inter-observer reproducibility and precision. Another two studies measured intra-pathologist reproducibility on cases read 10 times by glass and digital methods. One additional study evaluated the effects of adding IHC control slides with each run, using 1 pathologist interpreting glass and digital slides randomized from the sets above along with appropriate controls for each slide in the set. Results: The overall results show that there is no statistical difference between the variance of performance when comparing glass and digital HER 2 interpretations; and there were no effects noted when control tissues were evaluated in conjunction with the test slides. Conclusions: The results show that there is an equivalence of result when interpreting HER 2 IHC slides in breast cancer by either glass slides or digital images. Digital interpretation can therefore be safely and effectively used for this purpose...|$|E

40|$|Cellular pathologists are {{doctors who}} {{diagnose}} disease {{by using a}} microscope to examine glass slides containing thin sections of human tissue.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to validate if ex-vivo multispectral photoacoustic (PA) imaging can differentiate between malignant prostate tissue, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and normal human prostate tissue. Materials and Methods: Institutional Review Board′s approval was obtained for this study. A total of 30 patients undergoing prostatectomy for biopsy-confirmed prostate cancer were included in this study with informed consent. Multispectral PA imaging was performed on surgically excised prostate tissue and chromophore images that represent optical absorption of deoxyhemoglobin (dHb), oxyhemoglobin (HbO 2), lipid, and water were reconstructed. After the imaging procedure is completed, malignant prostate, BPH and normal prostate regions were marked by the genitourinary pathologist on histopathology <b>slides</b> <b>and</b> <b>digital</b> images of marked histopathology slides were obtained. The histopathology images were co-registered with chromophore images. Region of interest (ROI) corresponding to malignant prostate, BPH and normal prostate were defined on the chromophore images. Pixel values within each ROI were then averaged to determine mean intensities of dHb, HbO 2, lipid, and water. Results: Our preliminary results show that there is statistically significant difference in mean intensity of dHb (P < 0. 0001) and lipid (P = 0. 0251) between malignant prostate and normal prostate tissue. There was difference in mean intensity of dHb (P < 0. 0001) between malignant prostate and BPH.

40|$|We {{describe}} a new algorithm for non-rigid registration capable of estimating a constrained dense displacement field from multi-modal image data. We applied this algorithm to capture non-rigid deformation between digital images of histological <b>slides</b> <b>and</b> <b>digital</b> flat-bed scanned images of cryotomed {{sections of the}} larynx, and carried out validation experiments to measure {{the effectiveness of the}} algorithm. The implementation was carried out by extending the open-source Insight ToolKit software. In diagnostic imaging of cancer of the larynx, imaging modalities sensitive to both anatomy (such as MRI and CT) and function (PET) are valuable. However, these modalities differ in their capability to discriminate the margins of tumor. Gold standard tumor margins can be obtained from histological images from cryotomed sections of the larynx. Unfortunately, the process of freezing, fixation, cryotoming and staining the tissue to create histological images introduces non-rigid deformations and significant contrast changes. We demonstrate that the non-rigid registration algorithm we present is able to capture these deformations and the algorithm allows us to align histological images with scanned images of the larynx. Our non-rigid registration algorithm constructs a deformation field to warp one image onto another. The algorithm measures image similarity using a mutual information similarity criterion, and avoids spurious deformations due to noise by constraining the estimated deformation field with a linear elastic regularization term. The finite element method is used to represent the deformation field, and our implementation enables us to assign inhomogeneous material characteristics so that hard regions resist internal deformation whereas soft regions are more pliant. A gradient descent optimization strategy is used and this has enabled rapid and accurate convergence to the desired estimate of the deformation field. A further acceleration in speed without cost of accuracy is achieved by using an adaptive mesh refinement strategy...|$|R
40|$|Background: The quality <b>and</b> {{limitations}} of <b>digital</b> <b>slides</b> {{are not fully}} known. We aimed to estimate intrapathologist discrepancy in detecting specific microscopic features on glass <b>slides</b> <b>and</b> <b>digital</b> <b>slides</b> created by scanning at × 20. Methods: Hematoxylin and eosin and periodic acid-Schiff glass slides were digitized using the Mirax Scan (Carl Zeiss Inc., Germany). Six pathologists assessed 50 - 71 digital slides. We recorded objective magnification, total time, and detection of the following: Mast cells; eosinophils; plasma cells; pigmented macrophages; melanin in the epidermis; fungal bodies; neutrophils; civatte bodies; parakeratosis; and sebocytes. This process was repeated using the corresponding glass slides after 3 weeks. The diagnosis was not required. Results: The mean time to assess digital slides was 176. 77 s and 137. 61 s for glass slides (P < 0. 001, 99 % confidence interval [CI]). The mean objective magnification used to detect features using digital slides was 18. 28 and 14. 07 for glass slides (P < 0. 001, 99. 99 % CI). Parakeratosis, civatte bodies, pigmented macrophages, melanin in the epidermis, mast cells, eosinophils, plasma cells, and neutrophils, were identified at lower objectives on glass slides (P = 0. 023 - 0. 001, 95 % CI). Average intraobserver concordance ranged from κ = 0. 30 to κ = 0. 78. Features with poor to fair average concordance were: Melanin in the epidermis (κ = 0. 15 - 0. 58); plasma cells (κ = 0. 15 - 0. 49); and neutrophils (κ = 0. 12 - 0. 48). Features with moderate average intrapathologist concordance were: parakeratosis (κ = 0. 21 - 0. 61); civatte bodies (κ = 0. 21 - 0. 71); pigment-laden macrophages (κ = 0. 34 - 0. 66); mast cells (κ = 0. 29 - 0. 78); and eosinophils (κ = 0. 31 - 0. 79). The average intrapathologist concordance was good for sebocytes (κ = 0. 51 - 1. 00) and fungal bodies (κ = 0. 47 - 0. 76).

40|$|In the histomorphological grading of {{prostate}} carcinoma, pathologists have regularly assigned comparable {{scores for the}} architectural Gleason and the now-obsolete nuclear World Health Organization (WHO) grading systems. Although both systems demonstrate good correspondence between grade and survival, {{they are based on}} fundamentally different biological criteria. We tested the hypothesis that this apparent concurrence between the two grading systems originates from an interpretation bias in the minds of diagnostic pathologists, rather than reflecting a biological reality. Three pathologists graded 178 prostatectomy specimens, assigning Gleason and WHO scores on glass <b>slides</b> <b>and</b> on <b>digital</b> images of nuclei isolated out of their architectural context. The results were analysed with respect to interdependencies among the grading systems, to tumour recurrence (PSA relapse > 0. 1 ng/ml at 48 months) and robust nuclear morphometry, as assessed by computer-assisted image analysis. WHO and Gleason grades were strongly correlated (r = 0. 82) and demonstrated identical prognostic power. However, WHO grades correlated poorly with nuclear morphology (r = 0. 19). Grading of nuclei isolated out of their architectural context significantly improved accuracy for nuclear morphology (r = 0. 55), but the prognostic power was virtually lost. In conclusion, the architectural organization of a tumour, which the pathologist cannot avoid noticing during initial slide viewing at low magnification, unwittingly influences the subsequent nuclear grade assignment. In our study, the prognostic power of the WHO grading system was dependent on visual assessment of tumour growth pattern. We demonstrate {{for the first time the}} influence a cognitive bias can have in the generation of an error in diagnostic pathology and highlight a considerable problem in histopathological tumour grading...|$|R

Additionally, the individual cores can be greatly altered and contain numerous irregularities such as missing cores, grid rotation and stretching. These factors demand the development of a robust method for de-arraying TMAs which identifies each TMA core, and assigns them to their appropriate coordinates on the constructed TMA slide. METHODOLOGY: This study presents a robust TMA de-arraying method consisting of three functional phases: TMA core segmentation, gridding and mapping. The segmentation of TMA cores uses a set of morphological operations to identify each TMA core. Gridding then utilises a Delaunay Triangulation based method to find the row and column indices of each TMA core. Finally, mapping correlates each TMA core from a high resolution TMA whole slide image with its name within a TMAMap. CONCLUSION: This study describes a genuine robust TMA de-arraying algorithm for the rapid identification of TMA cores from digital slides. The result of this de-arraying algorithm allows the easy partition of each TMA core for further processing. Based on a test group of 19 TMA slides (3129 cores), 99. 84 % of cores were segmented successfully, 99. 81 % of cores were gridded correctly and 99. 96 % of cores were mapped with their correct names via TMAMaps.
