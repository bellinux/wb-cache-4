25|$|After {{forming a}} {{dielectric}} oxide on the rough anode structure, {{a counter electrode}} has to match the rough insulating oxide surface. This is accomplished by the electrolyte, which acts as the cathode electrode of an electrolytic capacitor. There are many different electrolytes in use. Generally they are distinguished into two species, “non-solid” and “solid” electrolytes. As a liquid medium which has ion conductivity caused by moving ions, non-solid electrolytes can easily fit the rough structures. Solid electrolytes which have electron conductivity can fit the rough structures {{with the help of}} <b>special</b> <b>chemical</b> processes like pyrolysis for manganese dioxide or polymerization for conducting polymers.|$|E
25|$|The {{aluminum}} oxide serves as dielectric and also protects the metallic aluminum against aggressive chemical reactions from the electrolyte. However, the converted layer of {{aluminum oxide}} {{is usually not}} homogeneous. It forms a complex multilayer structured laminate of amorphous, crystalline and porous crystalline aluminum oxide mostly covered with small residual parts of unconverted aluminum hydroxide. For this reason, {{in the formation of}} the anode foil, the oxide film is structured by a <b>special</b> <b>chemical</b> treatment so that either an amorphous oxide or a crystalline oxide is formed. The amorphous oxide variety yields higher mechanical and physical stability and fewer defects, thus increasing the long term stability and lowering the leakage current.|$|E
25|$|The {{planetary}} {{core of the}} IIABs {{was rich}} in sulfur and phosphorus. This <b>special</b> <b>chemical</b> composition caused the magma to split into two separate liquids while cooling. The concentration of sulfur is estimated to have been about 5%. For this reason the metallic magma reached the liquidus curve (a point where solids coexist with a liquid) of the iron + liquid field. This led to the crystallization of the IIAB meteorites. The remaining liquid was trapped in cavities of the IIABs and crystallized once the temperature reached the eutectic point. At this temperature the remaining magma crystallized schreibersite and iron, thereby forming the IIG meteorites.|$|E

25|$|Transduction is {{the process}} through which energy from {{environmental}} stimuli is converted to neural activity for the brain to understand and process. The back of the eye contains three different cell layers: photoreceptor layer, bipolar cell layer and ganglion cell layer. The photoreceptor layer {{is at the very}} back and contains rod photoreceptors and cone photoreceptors. Cones are responsible for color perception. There are three different cones: red, green and blue. Rods, are responsible for the perception of objects in low light. Photoreceptors contain within them a <b>special</b> <b>chemical</b> called a photopigment, which are embedded in the membrane of the lamellae; a single human rod contains approximately 10 million of them. The photopigment molecules consist of two parts: an opsin (a protein) and retinal (a lipid). There are 3 specific photopigments (each with their own color) that respond to specific wavelengths of light. When the appropriate wavelength of light hits the photoreceptor, its photopigment splits into two, which sends a message to the bipolar cell layer, which in turn sends a message to the ganglion cells, which then send the information through the optic nerve to the brain. If the appropriate photopigment is not in the proper photoreceptor (for example, a green photopigment inside a red cone), a condition called color vision deficiency will occur.|$|E

60|$|As {{applied to}} life, then, the {{evolutionary}} idea is briefly this--that {{plants and animals}} have all a natural origin from a single primitive living creature, which itself {{was the product of}} light and heat acting on the <b>special</b> <b>chemical</b> constituents of an ancient ocean. Starting from that single early form, they have gone on developing ever since, from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous, assuming ever more varied shapes, till at last they have reached their present enormous variety of tree, and shrub, and herb, and seaweed, of beast, and bird, and fish, and creeping insect. Evolution throughout has been one and continuous, from nebula to sun, from gas-cloud to planet, from early jelly-speck to man or elephant. So at least evolutionists say--and of course they ought to know most about it.|$|E

6000|$|It {{has been}} long {{seen by the}} best thinkers on the subject, that atoms,--considered as minute solid bodies from which emanate the {{attractive}} and repulsive forces which give what we term matter its properties,--could serve no purpose whatever; since it is universally admitted that the supposed atoms never touch each other, and it cannot be conceived that these homogeneous, indivisible, solid units, are themselves the ultimate cause of the forces that emanate from their centres. As, therefore, none of the properties of matter can {{be due to the}} atoms themselves, but only to the forces which emanate from the points in space indicated by the atomic centres, it is logical continually to diminish their size till they vanish, leaving only localized centres of force to represent them. Of the various attempts that have been made to show how the properties of matter may be due to such modified atoms (considered as mere centres of force), the most successful, because the simplest and the most logical, is that of Mr. Bayma, who, in his [...] "Molecular Mechanics," [...] has demonstrated how, from the simple assumption of such centres having attractive and repulsive forces (both varying according to the same law of the inverse squares as gravitation), and by grouping them in symmetrical figures, consisting of a repulsive centre, an attractive nucleus, and one or more repulsive envelopes, we may explain all the general properties of matter; and, by more and more complex arrangements, even the <b>special</b> <b>chemical,</b> electrical, and magnetic properties of special forms of matter.[I] Each chemical element will thus consist of a molecule formed of simple atoms, (or as Mr. Bayma terms them to avoid confusion, [...] "material elements") in greater or less number and of more or less complex arrangement; which molecule is in stable equilibrium, but liable to be changed in form by the attractive or repulsive influences of differently constituted molecules, constituting the phenomena of chemical combination, and resulting in new forms of molecule of greater complexity and more or less stability.|$|E
