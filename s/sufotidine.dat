50|$|<b>Sufotidine</b> (INN, USAN, codenamed AH25352) is a long-acting {{competitive}} H2 receptor antagonist {{which was}} under development as an antiulcerant by Glaxo (now GlaxoSmithKline). It was {{planned to be}} a follow-up compound to ranitidine (Zantac). When taken in doses of 600 mg twice daily it induced virtually 24-hour gastric anacidity thus closely resembling the antisecretory effect of the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole. Its development was terminated in 1989 from phase III clinical trials based on the appearance of carcinoid tumors in long-term toxicity testing in rodents.|$|E
40|$|In {{a double}} blind study, 24 hour intragastric acidity and 24 hour plasma gastrin {{concentrations}} were measured simultaneously in seven duodenal ulcer subjects {{on the fifth}} day of receiving either <b>sufotidine</b> 600 mg bd or placebo. Compared with placebo, during treatment with <b>sufotidine</b> 600 mg bd the median integrated 24 hour intragastric acidity was decreased by 95 % (range 74 % to 99 %) from 1000 to 51 mmol/h/l, whilst the median integrated 24 hour plasma gastrin concentration increased from 416 to 927 pmol/h/l...|$|E
