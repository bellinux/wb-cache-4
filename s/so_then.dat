5|$|If any motion exists {{without a}} cause, then not every {{proposition}} will be either true or false. For {{that which has}} not efficient causes is neither true nor false. But every proposition is either true or false. Therefore, there is no motion without a cause. And if this is <b>so,</b> <b>then</b> all effects owe their existence to prior causes. And if this is so, all things happen by fate. It follows therefore that whatever happens, happens by fate.|$|E
5|$|Goblet of Fire was {{the first}} book in the Harry Potter series to be {{released}} in the United States on the same date as the United Kingdom, on 8 July 2000, strategically on a Saturday so children did {{not have to worry about}} school conflicting with buying the book. It had a combined first-printing of over five million copies. It was given a record-breaking print run of 3.9 million. Three million copies of the book were sold over the first weekend in the US alone. FedEx dispatched more than 9,000 trucks and 100 planes to fulfill book deliveries. The pressure in editing caused a mistake which shows Harry's father emerging first from Voldemort's wand; however, as confirmed in Prisoner of Azkaban, James died first, <b>so</b> <b>then</b> Harry's mother ought to have come out first. This was corrected in later editions.|$|E
5|$|In April 1941, the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) asked Arthur Compton, a Nobel-Prize-winning physics {{professor}} at the University of Chicago, {{to report on the}} uranium program. His report, submitted in May 1941, foresaw the prospects of developing radiological weapons, nuclear propulsion for ships, and nuclear weapons using uranium-235 or the recently discovered plutonium. In October he wrote another report on the practicality of an atomic bomb. Niels Bohr and John Wheeler had theorized that heavy isotopes with odd atomic numbers were fissile. If <b>so,</b> <b>then</b> plutonium-239 was likely to be.|$|E

5|$|Niels Bohr and John Wheeler had {{theorized that}} heavy {{isotopes}} with odd atomic mass numbers were fissile. If <b>so,</b> <b>then</b> plutonium-239 {{was likely to}} be. In May 1941, Emilio Segrè and Glenn Seaborg at the University of California produced 28 μg of plutonium in the 60-inch cyclotron there, {{and found that it}} had 1.7 times the thermal neutron capture cross section of uranium-235. At the time only such minute quantities of plutonium-239 had been produced, in cyclotrons, and {{it was not possible to}} produce a sufficiently large quantity that way. Compton discussed with Wigner how plutonium might be produced in a nuclear reactor, and with Robert Serber about how that plutonium might be separated from uranium. His report, submitted in November, stated that a bomb was feasible.|$|E
5|$|Stars {{are created}} within galaxies from a reserve of cold gas that forms into giant {{molecular}} clouds. Some galaxies {{have been observed}} to form stars at an exceptional rate, which {{is known as a}} starburst. If they continue to do <b>so,</b> <b>then</b> they would consume their reserve of gas in a time span less than the lifespan of the galaxy. Hence starburst activity usually lasts for only about ten million years, a relatively brief period in the history of a galaxy. Starburst galaxies were more common during the early history of the Universe, and, at present, still contribute an estimated 15% to the total star production rate.|$|E
5|$|A world {{containing}} {{creatures who}} are significantly free (and freely perform more good than evil actions) is more valuable, all else being equal, than a world containing no free creatures at all. Now God can create free creatures, but He can't cause or determine {{them to do}} only what is right. For if He does <b>so,</b> <b>then</b> they aren't significantly free after all; they do not {{do what is right}} freely. To create creatures capable of moral good, therefore, He must create creatures capable of moral evil; and He can't give these creatures the freedom to perform evil {{and at the same time}} prevent them from doing so. As it turned out, sadly enough, some of the free creatures God created went wrong in the exercise of their freedom; this is the source of moral evil. The fact that free creatures sometimes go wrong, however, counts neither against God's omnipotence nor against His goodness; for He could have forestalled the occurrence of moral evil only by removing the possibility of moral good.|$|E

Experimental evidence is needed to definitively establish the causal role of soft drink consumption. Reviews of the experimental evidence suggest that soft drink consumption does cause weight gain, but the effect is often small except for overweight individuals.|$|E
