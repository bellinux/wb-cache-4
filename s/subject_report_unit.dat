40|$|Updated {{information}} on cultivated land {{is important for}} Chinese central and local governments. The data can be acquired using aerial photographs and Thematic Mapper (TM) images. But an exhaustive annual survey covering all of China's territory by these remote sensing images is too expensive, therefore a sampling technique has to be employed. Spatial sampling takes the spatial distribution characteristics of the object to be monitored into account. We propose both direct and indirect spatial sampling models for monitoring spatially discrete distributed objects. For the indirect method, each sampling domain is equal to a specified region but is not directly linked with the <b>reporting</b> <b>unit,</b> consequently, the <b>report</b> <b>unit</b> estimates may have few or perhaps even no samples within the <b>report</b> <b>units.</b> Therefore the indirect sampling model can provide sampling estimates for {{a large number of}} <b>report</b> <b>units</b> with a limited number of sample units and a limited sampling budget. The zoning of the monitored object is based on prior knowledge about the controlling factors and the spatial homogeneity of the variable. The method is used to develop a sampling solution for monitoring cultivated land dynamics. The models were tested in Shandon province and Zhaozhuang county...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{nutritional}} status of police officers in comparison to the recommendations by the Australian Department of Health & Ageing (ADHA, 1998). Sixtyseven subjects completed the Nutritional Status Questionnaire (NSQ) that investigates dietary habits (average number of healthy meals, average servings of vegetables, average servings of dairy products, average servings of meat products; average servings of fruits, and average servings of cereals and/or grains) and perceptions (perceived nutritional status, perceived nutritional status in comparison to workmates and immediate family). Supporting the hypothesis was the finding that <b>subjects</b> <b>reported</b> lower than the recommended average daily intake of five servings of vegetables; two servings of dairy products; two servings of fruit; and four servings of cereal or grains. Not supporting the hypothesis was the finding that <b>subjects</b> tended to <b>report</b> eating more than recommended one serving of meat products per day. Pearson’s correlation coefficients provided evidence of a significant positive relationship between dietary perceptions (nutritional status in comparison to workmates and immediate family) and average number of meals consumed each day, and average diet scores. Other findings from this study were that 44 % of <b>subjects</b> <b>reported</b> not consuming any tea; 27. 8 % of <b>subjects</b> <b>reported</b> not consuming any coffee; 91 % <b>subjects</b> <b>reported</b> not consuming any hot chocolate; 42 % of <b>subjects</b> <b>reported</b> not consuming any alcohol on after work; 41. 8 % <b>subjects</b> in <b>reported</b> not consuming any alcohol on days away from work. Sixty-nine percent of subjects in this study did not smoke. The findings from this study provide evidence towards the possible adverse impact of shiftwork on an individual’s dietary habits and perceptions...|$|R
