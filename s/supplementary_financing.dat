40|$|The {{perennial}} {{debate on}} {{the relative merits of}} alternative exchange-rate regimes was revived in the 1990 s by a succession of exchange-rate crises and associated global contagion. Despite declining enthusiasm for market-determined exchange rates, the currencies of most developed countries continued to float subject to only limited discretionary intervention. The major exception has been the European Union. Following a period of crises that accompanied attempts to keep exchange rates within predefined limits, eleven EU members opted for a common regional currency issued by a regional central bank [...] a choice not even on the policy menu {{at the start of the}} decade. Developing countries and transition economies were also divided between those willing to cope with a market-determined rate and those choosing to fix in terms of another currency or currency basket. The newest twist for countries that fix their rate concerns minimizing the risk of crisis, and especially crisis via contagion.

While other countries have often complemented statutory pensions with funded occupational pension schemes, in France, the social partners have put in place an encompassing network of <b>supplementary</b> pension arrangements <b>financed</b> on a pay-as-you-go (PAYG) basis. The generosity of these schemes and their defence by trade unions {{and part of the}} business community has considerably limited the room for expansion of funded pension schemes.

First, the gradual harmonization of rules within the different schemes and their compliance with EU social security regulations are leading to their quasi “first-pillarization”. Second, similar to statutory pensions, these schemes have also undergone gradual retrenchment and will offer reduced replacement rates. As a result, the development of pension savings has been implicitly promoted, although more on a voluntary basis than on a compulsory one.

First, a high chlorophylls/carotenoids ratio and a low chlorophyll a/b ratio imply that the photosynthetic apparatus has structural differences with respect to other olive varieties; second, in the carotenoid fraction, a low percentage of lutein, {{a high percentage of}} β-carotene, and a high content in neoxanthin are signs that in these three olive varieties the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway is displaced, favoring the β,β series over the α,β series.

This paper uses the first-hand survey data in 2008 - 2009 in Zhejiang Province, one of the pioneering regions for developing pawn-broking business, to study the special characteristics of the pawn-broking industry and explain why it has become a viable and useful financing instrument in transitional China. Through examining why there was a serious setback and widespread loss in the industry during the global financial crisis in 2008 - 09, we argue that the crisis increased the default rate of export-oriented SMEs, which reduced their demand for pawn-broking loans. The strict regulations in the pawn-broking industry and the low efficiency of litigation in China also increased the operation costs of handling defaults by the pawnshops, leading to a temporary setback in an otherwise rapidly growing pawnbroking business during the crisis. However, the pawn-broking industry will continue {{to play an important role}} in financing SMEs in China in the foreseeable future...|$|E

The method consists of a pigment extraction in liquid phase and subsequent analysis by HPLC-DAD. The profile of chlorophyll pigments of an olive oil is determined essentially by its content in pheophytins (a and b), but in no case any copper derivative. Different samples of colorant E 141 i have been analyzed, the natural coloring additives used to adulterate vegetable oils. The 99. 59 ± 0. 52 % of the chlorophyll pigments present in the different samples of E 141 i colorant are not those of an olive oil (more than 75 % are cuproderivatives). Thus, the simple detection of one of the compounds in an olive oil indicates adulteration. The major chlorophyll derivative in all the E 141 i colorants samples is Cu-pyropheophytin a and its limit of detection (LOD) defined at a signal-to-noise ratio of about 3 was 6. 58 ng/g. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

The explosion of global capital markets and the associated expansion of private capital flows to emerging market economies provide new opportunities to finance infrastructure projects in these countries, if projects can be made commercially viable. Several experienced international companies are interested in investing in infrastructure development in Asia provided the overall investment climate is perceived as attractive, and many countries in the region have domestic entrepreneurs keen to enter these sectors. Despite these apparently favourable circumstances, the experience in introducing private investment into infrastructure development has been mixed at best.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of the additional supplementary pension provision through the Riester pension reform led to {{a fundamental change in}} the retirement provision system in Germany. Private providers accordingly assumed tasks which had up to then been incumbent on the statutory social security system. The reform defined a system break, which redefined the role of the private providers. Up to now the effect on the pension provision has thereby remained unexplained and worthy of discussion in research. The question is raised which consequences the {{introduction of}} the additional supplementary pension provision with products from private providers has on tangible pension provision in Germany. This survey deals with the publicly funded and consequently socially relevant methods of privately <b>financed</b> <b>supplementary</b> pension provision via the Riester pension provision as well as through company pension schemes.

The survey design builds on quantifying providers, qualifying the application and the propagation of the supplementary pension provision and evaluating the offered products. The focus of the evaluation is the reconstruction of the actuarial pension annuity calculation. Since – according to the thesis adopted here – only the reconstruction of the product calculation can explain and determine the performance level of the pension annuity...|$|R

40|$|In most countries, pawnbroking is an {{intermediate}} financial instrument to help private households or individuals meet their short-term and urgent consumption needs. In China, due to market imperfection and institutional discrimination against {{the small and}} medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by commercial banks and other formal financial institutions, pawnbroking {{has been used as a}} <b>supplementary</b> <b>financing</b> source for SMEs and private entrepreneurs when they cannot get access to bank credits or other financial sources such as usury (underground money shops). This paper uses first-hand survey data in 2009 in Zhejiang Province, China’s pioneering region for pawn business, and secondary data for the whole country during 2004 - 12, to understand the special characteristics of the pawnbroking industry and explain why it has become a viable and useful financing instrument in China. It also explains the puzzle of a serious setback and widespread losses in the industry during the world financial crisis. A corporate financing model of SMEs is developed to explain the substitution relationship between formal bank credits and pawnbroking. It suggests that the stimulus plan implemented by the central government of China during the global financial crisis reduced the borrowing cost and lowered the access barrier of bank credits to SMEs, leading to a temporary setback of an otherwise rapidly growing pawnbroking business in 2008 and 2009. However, as quantitative easing is gradually phased out after the global financial crisis, pawnbroking activities recover rapidly, implying that the industry will continue to play an important role in China’s economic development given its current financial system which is still unfriendly to the SME sector...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMany {{public and}} private sector projects, such as {{hydropower}} dams or mines, trigger forced population displacement but fail to resettle people sustainably and instead cause their impoverishment. Social science {{research has found that}} one root cause of such failures and of impoverishment is asset dispossession and the insufficient financing of resettlement. Most governments, however, state that (1) compensation alone is sufficient for restoring the income and livelihood of those displaced, and (2) resources to supplement compensation with additional financing are not available. The author critiques and rejects these positions. He offers a theoretical analysis of the limits and flaws of compensation payments for expropriated assets, and argues that resources are available for supplementing compensation with financial investments for resettlers' development. The sources for <b>supplementary</b> <b>financing</b> are the economic rent (windfall profits) generated by natural resource projects such as hydropower or mining and the regular stream of benefits generated by all projects that require resettlement. Further, the author argues that financial investments in resettlers' welfare are indispensable and that benefit sharing is feasible. Therefore, both should become basic principles of resettlement legislation and practice. In addition to theoretical analysis, the author documents with empirical evidence that some countries (China, Brazil, Canada, Columbia and Japan) already make investments additional to compensation for post-displacement reconstruction. The author sums up his argument in these key points: (1). Compensation alone cannot prevent the impoverishment of resettlers and cannot in itself restore and improve their livelihoods;(2). Additional financing is needed for direct investments in resettlement with development;(3). Compensation levels must be increased;(4). Financing resources are available in most cases for investing in resettlers' development, but allocation of investments depends on the political will of governments and project owners;(5).

40|$|AbstractSuccessful {{immunisation}} programmes generally {{result from}} high vaccine effectiveness and adequate uptake of vaccines. In {{the development of}} new vaccination strategies, the structure and strength of the local healthcare system is a key consideration. In high income countries, existing infrastructures are usually used, while in less developed countries, the capacity for introducing new vaccines may need to be strengthened, particularly for vaccines administered beyond early childhood, such as the measles or human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. Reliable immunisation service funding is another important factor and low income countries often need external <b>supplementary</b> sources of <b>finance.</b> Many regions also obtain support in generating an evidence base for vaccination via initiatives created by organisations including World Health Organization (WHO), the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the Agence de Médecine Préventive and the Sabin Vaccine Institute. Strong monitoring and surveillance mechanisms are also required. An example is the efficient and low-cost approaches for measuring the impact of the hepatitis B control initiative and evaluating achievement of goals that have been established in the WHO Western Pacific region. A review of implementation strategies reveals differing degrees of success. For example, in the Americas, PAHO advanced a measles-mumps-rubella vaccine strategy, targeting different population groups in mass, catch-up and follow-up vaccination campaigns. This has had much success but coverage data from some parts of the region suggest that children are still not receiving all appropriate vaccines, highlighting problems with local service infrastructures. Stark differences in coverage levels are also observed among high income countries, {{as is the case with}} HPV vaccine implementation in the USA versus the UK and Australia, reflecting differences in delivery settings. Experience and research have shown which vaccine strategies work well and the factors that encourage success, which often include strong support from government and healthcare organisations, as well as tailored, culturally-appropriate local approaches to optimise outcomes...|$|R

Tomamos por base os Balanços Gerais da União para mostrar a forma pela qual o MEC, durante os dois mandatos de Fernando Henrique Cardoso (1995 - 1999 e 1999 - 2003), vem reduzindo gradativamente suas despesas de custeio. Essa redução se verifica a partir da política de ajuste macroeconômico, o qual impõe severas restrições aos gastos públicos, {{inclusive}} na área social. Tais restrições se efetivaram no contexto em que o MEC passou a exercer sua ação supletiva, com o objetivo de priorizar a universalização do ensino fundamental, principal bandeira do Governo Fernando Henrique Cardoso para a educação. Com o objetivo de cumprir essa prioridade educacional, a União, através do MEC, transferiu parcelas significativas do seu orçamento a estados e municípios. A adoção dos ajustes macroeconômicos e a transferência de recursos afetaram drasticamente o orçamento dos Cefets e das ETFs, o que se explicita através da diminuição sistemática das suas despesas correntes.

We used the National Annual Balance Sheets to show how, during President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's two terms (1995 - 1999 and 1999 - 2003) the Ministry of Education gradually reduced its funding of those institutions. All these budgetary reductions took place after the implementation of the macroeconomic adjustment policies, as the latter imposed severe restrictions on public expenditure in general, including that on the social area. These restrictions were put into practice in a context where the MEC started to play a stronger role in <b>financing</b> <b>supplementary</b> education. The Ministry's objective was to prioritise the universalization of elementary education, the main banner of President Cardoso's government. So, the Federal Government transferred significant amounts from its own budget to the states and municipalities through MEC.

SAVE II is a non-technological programme with many elements, among others labelling, standardisation and other {{actions in the}} area of energy-using equipment. This report summarises the results of the Working Group on Efficient Domestic Ovens. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify possible EU Commission actions to improve the efficiency of domestic electric and gas ovens and to develop a common basis for possible national actions. The study focuses on conventional domestic ovens only. Other ways of cooking, such as hobs, microwave ovens, grills and electric kettles are not taken into consideration. Possibilities for and impacts of fuel switching are also outside the scope of this study. However, a wide range of possibilities to improve energy efficiency, and related policy options, are discussed in a qualitative way, to give a more complete picture of ovens in the context of climate policies. The study, financed by the SAVE II Programme (with <b>supplementary</b> <b>financing</b> from NOVEM for the Dutch partner) was carried out in 1998 - 1999 by research teams from eight countries. Representatives of NOVEM and CECED as well as those of the relevant working groups of CENELEC (CLC/TC 59 X/WG 3) and CEN (CEN/TC 49 /WG 2) have participated in the meetings. CECED has also provided data for a number of tasks. The work was organised in six tasks. The aim of Task 1 was to establish the real life energy consumption of the ovens concerned, as opposed to the energy consumption according to the test standard. Task 2 was to provide a statistical analysis of the European gas and electric ovens market. The purpose of Task 3 was to review, identify, and analyse energy-saving design options for domestic ovens. Task 4 was to assess the environmental impacts of scenarios concerning the efficiency improvements of domestic ovens. A stock model methodology was used. Task 5 aimed at analysing the different impacts of efficiency policies on manufacturers. The aim of Task 6 was to give the information necessary to develop an appropriate mix of policies. The focus is on actions at EU level. The following policy options were analysed: • EU energy labels which are warranted for domestic ovens through directive n...|$|E
