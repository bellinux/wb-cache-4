5|$|He {{was dressed}} in a strange way. A šajkača was pulled to the front of his head and almost {{completely}} covered his forehead. His eyebrows were hardly visible. Under its weight, the ears seemed to have collapsed. He wore a kind of long, black coat, covered in mud and held in place by a string. He used another piece of string for a belt, and from it hung a pot for boiling water, a tea strainer, a canteen, and other useful things. He walked <b>slightly</b> <b>bent</b> forward, followed everywhere by the noise of the things clashing at his waist.|$|E
5|$|In the four-armed form, a {{right hand}} holds a parashu (axe) and another makes an abhaya mudra (gesture of reassurance), {{or one of}} the right arms is <b>slightly</b> <b>bent</b> and rests on the head of Shiva's bull mount, Nandi, while the other is held in the abhaya mudra gesture. Another {{configuration}} suggests that a right hand holds a trishula (trident) and another makes a varada mudra (gesture of blessing). Another scripture prescribes that a trishula and akshamala (rosary) are held in the two right hands. In the two-armed form, the right hand holds a kapala (skull cup) or gestures in a varada mudra. He may also hold a skull. In the Badami relief, the four-armed Ardhanarishvara plays a veena (lute), using a left and a right arm, while other male arm holds a parashu and the female one a lotus.|$|E
5|$|Shell colour is variable, from golden {{yellow to}} light yellowish-brown to grey. The {{underside}} of the shell is rarely dark; more frequently it is paler than the top, or totally white. In all cases, the shell aperture is white. Mature specimens sometimes have a metallic-grey or golden-brown gloss on {{the margin of the}} outer lip and the callus. A zigzag network of darker lines is sometimes present {{on the outside of the}} shell. The periostracum, a layer of protein (conchiolin) that is the outermost part of the shell surface, is yellowish-brown. It is usually thick, reticulated (net-like) and fimbriated (fringed) over the suture. The corneous operculum is dark brown, and its shape is fairly typical of the family Strombidae: a <b>slightly</b> <b>bent</b> sickle, with seven to eight weak lateral serrations.|$|E

5|$|Bhikshatana {{is often}} pictured with four arms in South Indian iconography. The front right arm is {{stretched}} out downwards {{and the hand}} holds a bit of grass or another plant in the kataka gesture, {{near the mouth of}} his pet deer or antelope, who leaps playfully by his side. The back right arm is raised and holds a damaru (drum). The front left hand holds a kapala (skull-cup), used as a begging bowl. The back left hand holds a trishula decorated with peacock feathers. The left leg is firmly rooted in the ground while the right one is <b>slightly</b> <b>bent,</b> suggesting walking. He often wears paduka (wooden sandals) but sometimes may be barefoot. The sandals are unique and identifying feature of Bhikshatana's iconography and distinguish him from other forms of Shiva and all other deities, who are always depicted barefoot. Sometimes Bhikshatana's iconography is amalgamated with that of Bhairava, in which case he displays Bhairava's attributes in addition to his own.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to {{the flat}} {{appearance}} of the loudspeaker, all three panels are slightly curved along the vertical axis to improve quality. The panels themselves are flat, but obtain their curvature by being <b>slightly</b> <b>bent</b> to a curved backing. With the bipolar nature of the speaker emitting sound from both front and back surfaces as it does, {{the application of a}} felt sheet {{to the rear of the}} panels damps and absorbs high frequencies radiating from the back. A crossover network, set at 500Hz, remains necessary to adjust for back-to-front interference causing loss in output at low frequencies. In addition, the speaker should stand in free space to achieve optimum sound. The instructions book contains advice against placement of the speaker in corners or positions close to or parallel with walls, and further explains that a corner placement will adversely affect bass response and be detrimental to the midrange because of standing waves generated.|$|E
25|$|In popular iconography, Longnü and Shancai {{are often}} seen {{alongside}} Guanyin as two children. Longnü is seen either holding a bowl or an ingot, {{which represents the}} Pearl of Light, whereas Shancai is seen with palms joined and knees <b>slightly</b> <b>bent</b> {{to show that he}} was once crippled.|$|E
50|$|If doing {{a sliding}} tackle to the right, the player's right leg must be {{straight}} when going {{down into the}} tackle and their left leg should be <b>bent</b> <b>slightly</b> behind the right one {{in order to achieve}} maximum potential in gaining the ball. If doing a sliding tackle to the left, the player's left leg must be straight and their right leg should be <b>bent</b> <b>slightly</b> behind the left one.|$|R

The Zn-C bonds measure 194.8(5) pm, while the C-Zn-C angle is <b>slightly</b> <b>bent</b> with 176.2(4)°. The {{structure of the}} gas-phase shows a very similar Zn-C distance (195.0(2) pm).|$|E
25|$|The galectin {{carbohydrate}} recognition domain (CRD) {{is constructed}} from beta-sheet of about 135 amino acids. The two sheets are <b>slightly</b> <b>bent</b> with 6 strands forming the concave side and 5 strands forming the convex side. The concave side forms a groove {{in which the}} carbohydrate ligand can bind, and which is long enough to hold about a linear tetrasaccharide.|$|E
25|$|After head goes {{underwater}}, {{both arms}} go underwater but still higher than head. After first dolphin kick, pull both arms immediately with downward motion. While pulling arms, legs are relaxed, both knees and waist are <b>slightly</b> <b>bent</b> to prepare dolphin kick. After arms push water backward, pull arms up simultaneous with dolphin kick. In this style, turning point from drowning to floating {{is at the}} time of downward arm motion.|$|E

50|$|The mould must be {{constructed}} {{so that the}} back side of the carrier foil rests against a flat wall. The plastic foil can be <b>bent</b> <b>slightly,</b> but the more it is bent, the greater the risk of wrinkles. The filling only takes place on the other side, the side of the carrier with the material to be transferred. The part has to stay on the side of the gate (= ejectors on gate side). The tips of the ejectors are usually <b>bent</b> <b>slightly</b> to ensure the parts stick to them.|$|R

25|$|A. duodenale worms are grayish {{white or}} pinkish {{with the head}} <b>slightly</b> <b>bent</b> in {{relation}} {{to the rest of the}} body. This bend forms a definitive hook shape at the anterior end for which hookworms are named. They possess well-developed mouths with two pairs of teeth. While males measure approximately one centimeter by 0.5 millimeters, the females are often longer and stouter. Additionally, males can be distinguished from females based on the presence of a prominent posterior copulatory bursa.|$|E
25|$|The typical {{depiction}} of a dwarf in Egyptian art is realistic, showing a normally grown torso and head, but visibly shortened and <b>slightly</b> <b>bent</b> arms and legs. These proportions point to achondroplasia and hypochondroplasia as the conditions responsible for the dwarfism of the individual. Yet, there are also reliefs of small peoples with normal body proportions and it remains unclear if these representations show real pygmies or if these people are represented small in order to reflect their low rank or accentuate the main scene of the relief.|$|E
25|$|Standing {{with legs}} {{slightly}} apart and knees <b>slightly</b> <b>bent,</b> the dancer then bends their left elbow {{to enable them}} to place their left hand behind their head. They then outstretch their right arm inline with their right shoulder, hand flat in a vertical position. The dancer then rotates around the waist in a 180 degree sweep, pulling back three times as you move your arm to the left, and then in one motion swing right arm back to the right. The move is then repeated. The dancer may then swap arms and reverse the move.|$|E

25|$|Offering 4 {{consists}} of sixteen male figurines positioned {{in a semicircle}} in front of six jade celts, perhaps representing stelae or basalt columns. Two of the figurines were made from jade, thirteen from serpentine, and one of reddish granite. This granite figurine one was positioned with its back to the celts, facing the others. All of the figurines had similar classic Olmec features including bald elongated heads. They had small holes for earrings, their legs were <b>slightly</b> <b>bent,</b> and they were undecorated– unusual if the figurines were gods or deities– but instead covered with cinnabar.|$|E
25|$|In hexaferrocenylbenzene, C66, all six {{positions}} on a benzene molecule have ferrocenyl substituents (R). X-ray diffraction {{analysis of this}} compound confirms that the cyclopentadienyl ligands are not co-planar with the benzene core but have alternating dihedral angles of +30° and −80°. Due to steric crowding the ferrocenyls are <b>slightly</b> <b>bent</b> with angles of 177° and have elongated C-Fe bonds. The quaternary cyclopentadienyl carbon atoms are also pyramidalized. Also, the benzene core has a chair conformation with dihedral angles of 14° and displays bond length alternation between 142.7pm and 141.1pm, both indications of steric crowding of the substituents.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no single}} universally {{accepted}} stance, with a wide variation between players who compete at professional cuesports. However, {{there are a number}} of common characteristics: generally the back leg is braced while the front leg is <b>slightly</b> <b>bent</b> with the player leaning into the shot; the player's weight is evenly distributed, and the body remains still for the duration of the shot. Many of the modern players face the line of the shot, while a more traditional stance would see the player twist their body so their back foot is at a right-angle to the shot.|$|E

25|$|Some {{children}} {{may have a}} slightly raised temperature; high fever and general malaise point to other, more serious conditions. On clinical examination, the child typically holds the hip <b>slightly</b> <b>bent,</b> turned outwards {{and away from the}} middle line (flexion, external rotation and abduction). Active and passive movements may be limited because of pain, especially abduction and internal rotation. The hip can be tender to palpation. The log roll test involves gently rotating the entire lower limb inwards and outwards with the patient on his back, to check when muscle guarding occurs. The unaffected hip and the knees, ankles, feet and spine are found to be normal.|$|E
25|$|Only {{two species}} present erect leaves {{and are the}} only ones {{frequently}} found as lithophytes, Scuticaria irwiniana, easily known recognized because of its flowers without any stains on the internally entirely purple and externally whitish sepals and petals, with white labellum, striped of purple. This species generally can be identified even without flowers because of its reptant, slightly ascendant growth, and longer rhizome than any other species. Scuticaria strictifolia also has erect leaves but occasionally, when cultivated under insufficient light, their leaves can be narrower and <b>slightly</b> <b>bent</b> making the distracted observer find hard to differentiate it from S. hadwenii. The Brazilian taxonomist Guido Pabst considered this species a variety of the later.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary {{bilateral}} transport arrangements prevented BUA from {{offering a}} first class on its East African routes. To compensate for {{this loss of}} competitiveness, Freddie Laker {{came up with the}} novel idea of designing a cargo door to be installed on the left-hand side of the forward fuselage of the airline's VC10s, where the first class cabin was normally located. This modification permitted the carriage of additional freight instead of first class passengers on the East African routes. BUA's VC10s also had extended wingtips that were <b>slightly</b> <b>bent</b> downwards to reduce the aircraft's cruise drag and to help it overcome the instability encountered when entering a stall, as well as an intermediate, 14-degree flap setting to enable all-year round, nonstop flights from the then relatively short runway at Nairobi's hot-and-high Embakasi Airport to Gatwick with a full payload and reserves.|$|E
