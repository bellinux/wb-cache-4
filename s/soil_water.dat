5|$|Devised by the American {{climatologist}} and geographer C. W. Thornthwaite, {{this climate}} classification method monitors the <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> budget using evapotranspiration. It monitors {{the portion of}} total precipitation used to nourish vegetation over a certain area. It uses indices such as a humidity index and an aridity index to determine an area's moisture regime based upon its average temperature, average rainfall, and average vegetation type. The lower {{the value of the}} index in any given area, the drier the area is.|$|E

Forensic taphonomy {{is the study of}} these postmortem changes to human remains caused by <b>soil,</b> <b>water,</b> and the interaction with plants, insects, and other animals. In order to study these effects, body farms have been set up by multiple universities. Students and faculty study various environmental effects on the decomposition of donated cadavers. At these locations, cadavers are placed in various situations and their rate of decomposition along with any other factors related to the decomposition process are studied. Potential research projects can include whether black plastic causes decomposition to occur faster than clear plastic or the effects freezing can have on a dumped body.|$|E
5|$|Lead is {{a common}} {{environmental}} pollutant. Causes of environmental contamination include industrial use of lead, such as is found in facilities that process lead-acid batteries or produce lead wire or pipes, and metal recycling and foundries. Children living near facilities that process lead, such as lead smelters, {{have been found to}} have unusually high blood lead levels. In August 2009, parents rioted in China after lead poisoning was found in nearly 2000 children living near zinc and manganese smelters. Lead exposure can occur from contact with lead in air, household dust, <b>soil,</b> <b>water,</b> and commercial products. Leaded gasoline has also been linked to increases in lead pollution. Some research has suggested a link between leaded gasoline and crime rates. Man made lead pollution has been elevated in the air for the past 2000 years. Lead pollution in the air is entirely due to human activity (mining and smelting).|$|E
5|$|Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface. Of this, 97.5% is {{the salty}} {{water of the}} oceans and only 2.5% freshwater, most of which is locked up in the Antarctic ice sheet. The {{remaining}} freshwater is found in glaciers, lakes, rivers, wetlands, the soil, aquifers and atmosphere. Due to the water cycle, fresh water supply is continually replenished by precipitation, however {{there is still a}} limited amount necessitating management of this resource. Awareness of the global importance of preserving water for ecosystem services has only recently emerged as, during the 20th century, more than half the world's wetlands have been lost along with their valuable environmental services. Increasing urbanization pollutes clean water supplies and much of the world still does not have access to clean, safe water. Greater emphasis is now being placed on the improved management of blue (harvestable) and green (<b>soil</b> <b>water</b> available for plant use) water, and this applies at all scales of water management.|$|E

Here, we assessed the fate of two ubiquitous pollutants, carbamazepine and anthracene, in <b>soil</b> <b>watered</b> with either UV-LED treated wastewaters or irrigation water. After 3 months, anthracene and carbamazepine were transformed two and three times faster respectively, in <b>soils</b> <b>watered</b> with UV-LED wastewater than in <b>soils</b> <b>watered</b> with tap water (probably because of the addition of organic matter by the effluent). Laccase activity was induced in the presence of the pollutants and anthraquinone was found as anthracene product of oxidation by laccases. Moreover, the addition of these pollutants into soil did not affect the functional diversity of autochthonous microbial communities assessed by Ecolog plates. Cellulase, protease and urease activities increased in <b>soils</b> <b>watered</b> with UV-LED treated wastewaters (UV-LED WW), showing transformation of organic matter from the effluent and lipase activity increased by anthracene addition, confirming the potential role of these enzymes as indicators of hydrocarbon contamination.

40|$|Soil erosion {{is one of}} the {{important}} causes of land degradation. Many <b>soil</b> and <b>water</b> conservation practices have been implemented in order to decrease soil erosion and prevent land degradation for a long period in Yanhe River Basin which is characteristic of serious soil erosion for concentrated rainfall, erodible soil and hilly and gully terrain. <b>Soil</b> and <b>water</b> conservation practices cannot only reduce <b>soil</b> and <b>water</b> loss but also change the situation of the land surface and influence the structure and functions of the eco-system.

25|$|Hydrogen {{and oxygen}} {{isotopes}} also work as tracers for water budget in terrestrial reservoirs, including lakes, rivers, groundwater and <b>soil</b> <b>water.</b> For a lake, both {{the amount of}} water in the lake and the isotopic composition of the water are determined by a balance between inputs (precipitation, stream and ground water inflow) and outputs (evaporation, stream and ground water outflow). The isotopic composition of lake water can often be used to track evaporation, which causes isotope enrichment in the lake water, as well as a δD-δ18O slope that is shallower than the meteoric water line. The isotopic composition of river water is highly variable and have complicated sources over different timescales, but can generally be treated as a two-endmember mixing problem, a base-flow endmember (mainly ground water recharge) and an overland-flow endmember (mainly storm events). The isotope data suggest that the long-term integrated base-flow endmember is more important in most rivers, even during peak flows in summer. Systematic river isotope data were collected across the world by the Global Network of Isotopes in Rivers (GNIR).The isotopic composition of groundwater {{can also be used to}} trace its sources and flow paths. An example is a groundwater isotope mapping study in Sacramento, California, which showed lateral flow of river water with a distinct isotope composition into the groundwater that developed a significant water table depression due to pumping for human use. The same study also showed an isotopic signal of agricultural water being recharged into the giant alluvial aquifer in California's Central Valley. Finally, the isotopic composition of <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> is important for the study of plants. Below the water table, the soil has a relatively constant source of water with a certain isotopic composition. Above the water table, the isotopic composition of <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> is enriched by evaporation until a maximum at the surface. The vertical profile of isotopic composition of <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> is maintained by the diffusion of both liquid and vapor water. A comparison of <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> and plant xylem water δD can be used to infer the depth at which plant roots get water from the soil.|$|E

Little information exists on <b>soil</b> and <b>water</b> management technologies requirements for {{male and female}} farmers in different agro-ecological regions. The objective of current study was to investigate farmers’ sources of information and perceptions on <b>soil</b> and <b>water</b> management technologies. Four sites selected from different agro-ecological regions (AERs), sub-humid (Mazowe/Goromonzi, and Kadoma) and semi-arid (Matobo and Chiredzi). Data on sources of information on <b>soil</b> and <b>water</b> management, types of technologies preferred by farmers and constraints to adoption of technologies were collected through household interviews and focus group discussions. Results showed that government extension agents, farmer-to farmer extension and non-governmental organizations were the main sources of information on <b>soil</b> and <b>water</b> management technologies at all the sites. NGOs mainly provide information on reduced tillage methods. Main technologies were mulching (61 %), reduced tillage methods (53 %), and contour ridges (33 %) in Mazowe/Goromonzi district, reduced tillage method (83) and mulching (64 %) in Kadoma, and reduced tillage methods (54 %) and contour ridges (47 %) in Matobo.
