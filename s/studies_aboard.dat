Mice were grouped three to a cage (one cage = one sample) and cages were assigned to either Foodbar or Purina Chow # 5001 (control) diet groups. Body weights, food intake, and water intake were obtained throughout the study. There {{were no significant differences}} in body weights between male Foodbar fed and Chow fed males (p= 0. 58), and at 15 weeks into the female mouse study there appear to be no significant body weight differences. Both {{male and female}} Foodbar fed groups consumed more food and less water than their Chow controls, both factors thought to be attributable to the high moisture content of the Foodbars (26 % versus 10 % for Chow). All differences in gross food and water consumption had p-values of less than 0. 01. When food and water intake were adjusted for the moisture content in the food, both male and female Foodbar fed animals consumed less food, but still had a lower water intake rate than their controls.

40|$|Efficient use {{of space}} and high yields are {{critical}} for long-term food production aboard the International Space Station. The selection of a full dwarf wheat (less than 30 cm tall) with high photosynthetic and yield potential is a necessary prerequisite for growing wheat in the controlled, volume-limited environments available aboard long-term spaceflight missions. This study evaluated the photosynthetic capacity and carbon partitioning of a full-dwarf wheat cultivar, Super Dwarf, which is routinely used in spaceflight <b>studies</b> <b>aboard</b> U. S. space shuttle and NASA/Mir missions and made comparisons with other dwarf and semi-dwarf wheat cultivars utilized in other ground-based studies in plant space biology. Photosynthetic capacity of the flag leaf in two dwarf (Super Dwarf, BB- 19), and three semi-dwarf (Veery- 10, Yecora Rojo, IBWSN 199) wheat cultivars (Triticum aestivum L.) was assessed by measuring: net maximum photosynthetic rate, RuBP carboxylation efficiency, chlorophyll concentration and flag leaf area. Dry mass partitioning of carbohydrates to the leaves, sheaths, stems and ear was also assessed. Plants were grown under controlled environmental conditions in three replicate studies: slightly enriched CO 2 (370 micromoles mol- 1), high photosynthetic photon flux (1000 micromoles m- 2 s- 1; 58 mol m- 2 d- 1) for a 16 h photoperiod, 22 / 15 degrees C day/night temperatures, ample nutrients and water provided by one-half strength Hoagland's nutrient solution (Hoagland and Arnon, 1950). Photosynthetic capacity of the flag leaf was determined at anthesis using net CO 2 exchange rate versus internal CO 2 concentration curves measured under saturating light (2000 micromoles m- 2 s- 1) and CO 2 (1000 micromoles mol- 1). Dwarf wheat cultivars had greater photosynthetic capacities than the taller semi-dwarfs, they averaged 20 % higher maximum net photosynthetic rates compared to the taller semi-dwarfs, but these higher rates occurred only at anthesis, had slightly greater carboxylation efficiencies and significantly increased chlorophyll concentrations per unit leaf area. The reduced-height wheat had significantly less dry mass fraction in the stem but greater dry mass partitioned to the ear than the taller semi-dwarfs (Yecora rojo, IBWSN- 199). Studies with detached heads confirm that the head is a significant sink in the shorter wheat cultivars...|$|E
40|$|C. elegans was {{proposed}} {{as a model}} system for space biology studies in 1991 and has since flown on STS- 42, STS- 76, and STS- 95. Data obtained from these flights have confirmed that C. elegans requires adequate in flight oxygenation and displays an increased rate of mutation, much like other organisms in space. Unlike vertebrates, C. elegans has been observed to successfully complete two continuous full life cycles in space without gross developmental abnormalities. These observations, could with the utility of C. elegans as a terrestrial, fully sequenced, model system make C. elegans {{a good candidate for}} long term research onboard the International Space Station (ISS). We are currently working on technology to support biological <b>studies</b> <b>aboard</b> the ISS. A component of this effort is {{in the development of the}} Space Station Biological Research Program (SSBRP) Incubator which will be able to house organisms at a constant temperature setpoint ranging from 4 deg C to 45 deg C. The SSBRP Incubator provides air exchange, power, data and video ports and, when placed in the collaborative NASA/NASDA 2. 5 M centrifuge rotor, will be capable of providing a lg gravity control. Current plans for validation of the Incubator include video monitoring and periodic sampling of C. elegans in the Incubator onboard the ISS. Once returned to earth, samples will be distributed for analysis via a specimen sharing plan and analyzed for gene expression and other parameters of growth and development in space flight. These data should provide the C. elegans research community with a baseline from which to propose studies for future flights. We have also been developing an appropriate method of culturing C. elegans in liquid media in order to remove the need for the crew to assure that strains are properly fed. Currently, we are growing strains in the chemically defined, axenic, media developed by Dr. Nancy Lu. Wild-type animals complete multiple generations and appear generally healthy after being grown in unchanged media for a minimum of three to four weeks. To assure proper oxygenation we have chosen to grow animals in ten milliliter OptiCells(TradeMark). The choice of the OptiCell(TradeMark) also allows for automation of culturing as demonstrated for cell cultures grown in the OptiCell(TradeMark). Arrangements have been made for the liquid media to be commercially produced by Mediatech, Inc. and OptiCells(TradeMark) are available from BioCrystal Ltd...|$|E

40|$|Field {{participation}} in the International Indian Ocean Expedition by scientists and research vessels of the University of California's Scripps Institution of Oceanography comprises three multi-program investigations: MONSOON (1960 - 1), LUSIAD (1962 - 3) and DODO (1964). All three expeditions, though first broadly outlined in 1959, lie within the cooperative international exploration of the Indian Ocean being sponsored by the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research and UNESCO. Therefore, though original schedules have to date been met, the programs have in fact been influenced and modified by the plans, interests and findings of other agencies and laboratories, and direct participation by marine scientists, students and trainees from other areas has been welcomed. Although the final SIO IIOE cruise, DODO, is just underway, a preliminary report on some generalized results {{of the first two}} expeditions seems appropriate now, with the clear understanding that many conclusions stated here may indeed be premature. Final analyses, syntheses and results will appear in more specialized formal publications and in the proposed SCOR-sponsored atlases which eventually will summarize Indian Ocean Expedition findings. At Scripps Institution, it is customary to give names, rather than number designations, to the major expeditions. The 1960 - 1 investigation, 3 ½ months in the Indian Ocean, embraced the first SIO field work in the "monsoon seas". It was funded primarily by the Office of Naval Research of the Navy Department, with auxiliary support for personnel and special equipment from the Bureau of Ships and the National Science Foundation. The primarily two-ship 1962 - 3 cruise, 11 ½ calendar months in the Indian Ocean, drew its name from "Os Lusiadas", the epic epic poem (ca. 1572) of Luis Camões celebrating the early explorations of the Indian Ocean by Portuguese navigators. LUSIAD was a joint operation of the University of California and the University of Rhode Island; the two three-months' equatorial current <b>studies,</b> <b>aboard</b> Argo, were planned and carried out under the over-all direction of John Knauss, formerly of SIO, now Dean of the Graduate School of Oceanography of URI. In greater part, LUSIAD was funded nearly equally by the Navy Department (through ONR and BuShips contracts) and by the National Science Foundation (NSF G- 22255). The current cruise on Argo, DODO, receives its support from these same sources. Its name, with a slight bow to Lewis Carroll of course, commemorates the now-extinct flightless bird of Mauritius, an island intimately linked with all three SIO cruises to the Indian Ocean...|$|E
