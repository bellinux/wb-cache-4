5|$|At 21:00, the British {{observed}} a {{fire on the}} lower decks of the Orient, the French flagship. Identifying the danger this posed to the Orient, Captain Hallowell directed his gun crews to fire their guns directly into the blaze. Sustained British gun fire spread the flames throughout the ship's stern and prevented all efforts to extinguish them. Within minutes the fire had ascended the rigging and set the vast sails alight. The nearest British ships, Swiftsure, Alexander, and Orion, all stopped firing, closed their gunports, and began edging away from the burning ship {{in anticipation of the}} detonation of the enormous ammunition supplies stored on board. In addition, they took crews away from the guns to form fire parties and to <b>soak</b> <b>the</b> sails and decks in seawater to help contain any resulting fires. Likewise the French ships Tonnant, Heureux, and Mercure all cut their anchor cables and drifted southwards away from the burning ship. At 22:00 the fire reached the magazines, and the Orient was destroyed by a massive explosion. The concussion of the blast was powerful enough to rip open the seams of the nearest ships, and flaming wreckage landed in a huge circle, much of it flying directly over the surrounding ships into the sea beyond. Falling wreckage started fires on Swiftsure, Alexander, and Franklin, although in each case teams of sailors with water buckets succeeded in extinguishing the flames, despite a secondary explosion on Franklin.|$|E

40|$|Cod salted {{with various}} {{combinations}} of NaCl, KCl, MgCl 2 and CaCl 2 were <b>soaked</b> for <b>the</b> first 24 h with a 0. 2 M carbonate buffer solution (pH 9. 5) {{or for the}} first 5 h with 1 % hydrogen peroxide (pH 7. 16). Chloride, ions and ash content in muscle were measured during <b>the</b> <b>soaking</b> process. After <b>soaking,</b> <b>the</b> composition of soluble muscle protein extracted in NaCl 0. 86 M was determined by SDS-PAGE. The divalent, cation content was not affected by <b>the</b> salting and <b>soaking</b> processes. <b>The</b> protein extractability was low, especially when H 2 O 2 was used. The use of alkaline buffer solution produced better protein functional quality. When the alkaline solution was used for <b>soaking,</b> <b>the</b> soluble fraction was constituted of a larger variety of proteins. Actin was soluble only when MgCl 2 and KCl were used for salting and the alkaline solution for <b>soaking.</b> <b>The</b> use of carbonate/bicarbonate buffer solution for soaking could therefore be useful to improve the functional quality of muscle protein of desalted cod. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

25|$|Reasonable {{care must}} be taken not to {{puncture}} or tear membrane dry suits, because buoyancy and insulation depend entirely on the air space in the undersuit, (whereas a wetsuit normally allows water to enter, and retains its insulation despite it). The dry suit material offers essentially no buoyancy or insulation itself, so if the dry suit leaks or is torn, water can <b>soak</b> <b>the</b> undersuit, with a corresponding loss of buoyancy and insulation.|$|E

The town’s craftsmen are dependent upon the bark supply provided by those in surrounding towns; this is mostly done by men, who cover an area of about 1,500km2 in the Sierra Norte to find the appropriate bark.

25|$|The {{winemaker}} can <b>soak</b> <b>the</b> skins {{of white}} grapes and practice maceration if {{the quality of}} the grapes is good. Pre-fermentation Maceration is generally performed at a controlled temperature to delay the onset of fermentation. This technique improves the extraction of varietal aromas and their precursors which are mainly located in the skin. Acidity decreases as does the ratio of Colloids (large pectin type molecules) and aging potential. To be implemented, this process requires a perfect de-stalking, moderate crushing and sulphite to protect the wort from oxidation. The duration (typically 5 to 18 hours at 18°C) depends on the variety, the temperature of maceration, the maturity of the grape, and {{the quality of the}} soil.|$|E

25|$|Biological control {{methods are}} also {{utilized}} in managing this disease. In the 1970's and 1980's, A commonly used practice for treating germinated seeds, seedlings, and rootstock was to <b>soak</b> <b>the</b> plant parts in a suspension of K84, a related but not pathogenic species of Agrobacterium, A. radiobacter. K84 produces a bacteriocin (agrocin 84) {{which is an}} antiobiotic specific against related bacteria, including A. tumefaciens.This method, which was successful at controlling the disease on a commercial scale, had the risk of K84 transferring its resistance gene to the pathogenic Agrobacteria. Thus, in the 1990's, use of a genetically engineering strain of K84, known as K-1026, was created. This strain is just as successful in controlling crown gall as K84 without the caveat of resistance gene transfer.|$|E

40|$|Shiitake is an edible mushroom {{native to}} East Asia. In the present research, <b>the</b> <b>soaking</b> water was {{targeted}} {{as the vehicle}} to enrich the substrate.

In this study, soaking water was enriched by some complement materials and enrichment effects on some important properties of shiitake mushroom were evaluated.

A strong south-westerly breeze had fanned the flames along the wood-panelled and narrow {{corridors}} into St Stephen's Chapel. Shortly after his arrival {{the roof of the}} chapel collapsed; the resultant noise was so loud that the watching crowds thought there had been a Gunpowder Plot-style explosion. According to The Manchester Guardian, [...] "By half-past seven o'clock the engines were brought to play upon the building both from the river and the land side, but the flames had by this time acquired such a predominance that the quantity of water thrown upon them produced no visible effect." [...] Braidwood saw {{it was too late to}} save most of the palace, so elected to focus his efforts on saving Westminster Hall, and he had his firemen cut away the part of the roof that connected the hall to the already burning Speaker's House, and then <b>soak</b> <b>the</b> hall's roof to prevent it catching fire.

2500|$|Every {{battalion}} in America {{had organized}} its own rifle company {{by the end}} of the war, although rifles were not formally issued to the army until the Baker Rifle in 1801. Flintlocks were heavily dependent on the weather; high winds could blow the gunpowder from the flash pan, while heavy rain could <b>soak</b> <b>the</b> paper cartridge, ruining the powder and rendering the musket unable to fire. Furthermore, flints used in British muskets were of notoriously poor quality; they could only be fired around six times before requiring resharpening, while American flints could fire sixty. This led to a common expression among the British: [...] "Yankee flint was as good as a glass of grog".|$|E
