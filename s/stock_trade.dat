25|$|A deeper {{investigation}} by the new board found additional problems. Georgine's profits from the <b>stock</b> <b>trade</b> {{were found to be}} far higher than anyone had guessed—nearly $8.8 million. Georgine and other Ullico executives also received millions of dollars in special bonuses and deferred compensation never approved by the board. O'Sullivan also disclosed that Ullico officers had loaned Georgine $2.2 million to purchase 40,000 shares of low-priced Ullico stock prior to the stock trading scheme, further enlarging his profits, and that Georgine's salary had risen from $900,000 in 1996 to $5.4 million in 2000. Ullico's compensation committee lacked the authority to approve both the loan and the salary increases but did so anyway. O'Sullivan then issued letters to Georgine and the other officers demanding that they refund this money.|$|E

Petipa mounted the work for his own benefit performance, which was to mark a [...] "semi-retirement" [...] for the Ballet Master. The ballet, set {{to the music of}} the avant-garde composer Arsenii Koreshchenko, was given on [...] at the Mariinsky Theatre to an audience composed of the whole Imperial Family and many members of the St. Petersburg nobility. The production boasted bizarre décor and costumes that were considered to be unsuited for a classical ballet. In spite of this Petipa received a roaring ovation from the audience {{at the end of the}} performance. Le Miroir magique was given , and was considered to be an all-around failure, though Petipa's choreography was not mentioned among the criticisms. Not long afterward rumour began to circulate that Petipa was to be replaced, and Telyakovsky even made an announcement to the <b>Stock</b> <b>Trade</b> Bulletin, a St. Petersburg newspaper, that [...] "...the ballet company will have to get used to a new Balletmaster – Alexander Gorsky. He will stage his own versions of 'The Little Humpbacked Horse' and 'Swan Lake'. He has staged both ballets (for the Moscow Bolshoi Theatre) entirely differently and in a much more original manner." [...] In the end Gorsky never succeeded Petipa as premier maître de ballet. The coveted post would later go to Mikhail Fokine.|$|E
