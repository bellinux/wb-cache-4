40|$|Recent {{work has}} {{considered}} a 1 Gbit/s multiple pulse position modulation system (MPPM) operating over {{plastic optical fibre}} (POF) while utilising maximum-likelihood detection (MLD) to minimise intersymbol interference (ISI). Here, an original analysis is presented, which significantly simplifies the receiver design by employing raised cosine filtering to eliminate ISI. Practical approximations to the ideal raised cosine filter are examined and it is shown that a very good performance is achieved by using a simple first-order pre-amplifier in cascade with a third-order Butterworth pre-detection filter, both with their bandwidths set at 0. 6 times the MPPM <b>slot</b> <b>rate.</b> When operating with a POF bandwidth of 0. 7 times the data rate, it is shown that both the ideal raised cosine scheme and the simple Butterworth pre-detection filter system offer improvements in sensitivity of 7. 6 and 8 dB respectively, over the more complex MPPM MLD system. A simplified analysis for MPPM that predicts sensitivities to within 0. 5 dB of those determined through the more rigorous treatment is presente...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} the performance {{analysis of the}} offset pulse position modulation (PPM) scheme using graded-index plastic optical fibre with a Gaussian impulse response. The aim of this analysis is to predict how sensitivity, error, number of required photons, threshold voltage, {{and the effect of}} inter-symbol interference will change with the change in the number of data bits encoded at a rate of 1 Gbit/s. An information theory analysis is presented in detail and also the band-utilization efficiency is determined. Results are compared to equivalent digital PPM and multiple PPM schemes and it is also shown that offset PPM gives an advantage over on-off keying (OOK). Bit error rate (BER) analysis has been presented numerically. The errors due to different coding techniques are compared. It has also been shown that offset pulse position modulation is more power efficient than multiple pulse position modulation. The spectral analysis of offset pulse position modulation coding scheme has been carried out. For an offset PPM sequence the spectral characteristics is presented both theoretically and numerically. The results show strong frequency components at the frame rate and, if return-to-zero pulses are used, the <b>slot</b> <b>rate.</b> Slot synchronisation has been taken into consideration {{for the first time as}} offset PPM spectrum exhibits discrete <b>slot</b> <b>rate</b> component. The effect of pulse shaping and modulating index on the spectrum has been shown. The dependency of slot component on the pulse shape is examined. The results show that the frame synchronisation is possible for offset PPM as this coding exhibits a strong frame rate component. A comparison of spectral characteristics has been presented considering digital, multiple and shortened PPM. For ease of implementation an offset PPM coder has been designed. In this work an efficient clock recovery topology is presented for offset PPM data sequence at the receiver end. For clock recovery, a phase locked loop is designed. Data recovery has also been presented. It is shown that a frame clock can be extracted from the data sequence that yields the possibility of frame synchronization. A detailed noise analysis has been performed for random offset PPM input. It has been shown that the proposed clock recovery system is also effective for extracting other data sequence. To elucidate, a multiple Pulse Position Modulation (MPPM) data sequence is considered. The MPPM data sequence has also been synchronised with the recovered clock. A noise analysis is carried out for multiple PPM...|$|E
40|$|Dicode pulse-position {{modulation}} (PPM) {{has been}} proposed as an alternative modulation format to conventional digital PPM, since it offers comparable receiver sensitivities while operating at significantly lower slot-clock rates. A recent numeric analysis considered the performance of dicode PPM, using slope detection, in a dispersive environment. In this paper, consideration is given to an alternative detection strategy, and new results are presented that show that intersymbol interference (ISI) can be eliminated {{through the use of}} central decision detection combined with raised cosine filtering. This leads to a more simplified receiver design and results in equivalent sensitivity performance at high fibre bandwidths and significantly improved performance at lower fibre bandwidths. Practical approximations to this approach are considered and design rules presented for determining the bandwidth of both the preamplifier and a simple 3 rd order Butterworth equalisation filter. It is shown that setting the bandwidth of both the preamplifier and equaliser to 0. 6 times the dicode <b>slot</b> <b>rate</b> gives sensitivities within 0. 2 dB of ideal dicode PPM raised cosine filtering, and that such a receiver can operate over a wide range of fibre bandwidths, with minimal degradation in sensitivit...|$|E

40|$|We study data {{communications}} for the downlink in code-division-multiple-access (CDMA) networks. The {{focus of this}} paper is to exploit the predictive temporal structure of the multi-access interference (MAI) for adaptive resource allocation, particularly for rate control and admission control. We also investigate the impact of fading and traffic burstiness on the system performance. We first present our result that when the input data traffic corresponds to multiple ON-OFF heavy tailed sources, the MAI process is asymptotically self-similar (with Hurst parameter 1 / 2 < H < 1). Thus the MAI has a nontrivial predictive temporal structure that enables accurate interference prediction. We exploit the predictive MAI structure to construct a multiple time-scale interference predictor. Rate adaptation is carried out based on the predicted interference level. Our numerical results show that this rate control scheme achieves significantly better performance than that using the packet-level MAI prediction only. We also devise a joint rate control and admission control scheme. To this end, we propose a sliding observation window scheme that has a two-tier flavor: Each observation window is divided into many time <b>slots,</b> <b>rate</b> control based on the interference prediction is conducted in each slot, and the corresponding throughput in the observation window is used for admission control accordingly...|$|R
