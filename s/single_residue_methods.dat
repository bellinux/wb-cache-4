40|$|International audienceDithiocarbamates (DTCs) are fungicides, {{which require}} a {{specific}} <b>single</b> <b>residue</b> <b>method</b> for detection and verification {{of compliance with}} maximum residue limits (MRLs) as established for fruits and vegetables in the EU. In this study, the use of ambient mass spectrometry was investigated for specific determination of individual DTCs (thiram, ziram) in fruits. Two complementary approaches have been investigated for their rapid analysis: (i) direct analysis in real time (DART) combined with medium-high resolution/accurate mass time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOFMS) and high-resolution/accurate mass orbitrapMS, and (ii) desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) combined with tandem-in-time mass spectrometry (MS 2). With both techniques, thiram deposited on a glass surface (DART) or Teflon (DESI) could be directly detected. With DART this was also possible for ziram. Before the instrumental analysis of fruit matrix, an extract had to be prepared following a straightforward procedure. The raw extracts were deposited on a slide (DESI), or rods were dipped into the extracts (DART), after which thiram and ziram could be rapidly detected (typically 10 samples in few minutes). In the case of thiram, the lowest calibration levels were 1 mg kg- 1 (DART-TOFMS, DESI- MS 2) and 0. 1 mg kg- 1 (DART-orbitrapMS). For ziram, the achieved lowest calibration levels were 0. 5 mg kg- 1 (DART-TOFMS) and 1 mg kg- 1 (DART-orbitrapMS). In all cases, this was sufficiently low to test samples against EU-MRLs {{for a number of}} fruit crops. By using an internal standard (semi) quantitative results could be obtained...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Of {{the three}} subclasses of Porcine Endogenous Retrovirus (PERV), PERV-A {{is able to}} infect human cells via one of two receptors, HuPAR 1 or HuPAR 2. Characterizing the structure-function {{relationships}} of the two HuPAR receptors in PERV-A binding and entry is important in understanding receptor-mediated gammaretroviral entry and contributes to evaluating the risk of zoonosis in xenotransplantation. Results Chimeras of the non-permissive murine PAR and the permissive HuPAR 2, which scanned the entire molecule, revealed that the first 135 amino acids of HuPAR 2 are critical for PERV-A entry. Within this critical region, eighteen <b>single</b> <b>residue</b> differences exist. Site-directed mutagenesis used to map <b>single</b> <b>residues</b> confirmed the previously identified L 109 as a binding and infectivity determinant. In addition, we identified seven residues contributing to the efficiency of PERV-A entry without affecting envelope binding, located in multiple predicted structural motifs (intracellular, extracellular and transmembrane). We also show that expression of HuPAR 2 in a non-permissive cell line results in an average 11 -fold higher infectivity titer for PERV-A compared to equal expression of HuPAR 1, although PERV-A envelope binding is similar. Chimeras between HuPAR- 1 and - 2 revealed that the region spanning amino acids 152 – 285 {{is responsible for the}} increase of HuPAR 2. Fine mapping of this region revealed that the increased receptor function required the full sequence rather than one or more specific residues. Conclusion HuPAR 2 has two distinct structural regions. In one region, a <b>single</b> <b>residue</b> determines binding; however, in both regions, multiple residues influence receptor function for PERV-A entry. </p...|$|R
