50|$|This crumbly form of proto-pottery was {{manufactured}} by pulverizing limestone, then heating it to a temperature {{in excess of}} 1000 °C. This reduced it to lime from which could be mixed with ashes, straw or gravel and made into a white or grey lime plaster. The plaster was initially so soft {{that it could be}} moulded, before hardening through air drying into a rigid cement. The plaster was formed into vessels by coiling to serve some of the functions of later clay pottery. White Ware vessels tended to be rather large and coarse, often found in the dwelling rooms where they were made indicating their use for <b>stationary</b> <b>storage</b> of dry goods. Designs included a range of large and heavy rectangular tubs, circular vessels and smaller bowls, cups and jars. Imprints of basketry on the exterior of some vessels suggest that some were shaped into large basket shapes. It is likely these larger vessels were mainly used for dry goods storage. Some of the White Ware vessels found were decorated with incisions and thick stripes of red ochre. Other uses of this material included plastering of skulls and as a floor or wall covering. Some lime plaster floors were also painted red, and a few were found with designs imprinted on them.|$|E
40|$|When {{addressing}} the urgent task of improving vaccine supply chains, especially {{to accommodate the}} introduction of new vaccines, there is often a heavy emphasis on <b>stationary</b> <b>storage.</b> Currently, donations to vaccine supply chains occur largely in the form of storage equipment. This study utilized a HERMES-generated detailed, dynamic, discrete event simulation model of the Niger vaccine supply chain to compare the impacts on vaccine availability of adding stationary cold storage versus transport capacity at different levels and to determine whether adding <b>stationary</b> <b>storage</b> capacity alone would be enough to relieve potential bottlenecks when pneumococcal and rotavirus vaccines are introduced by 2015. Relieving regional level storage bottlenecks increased vaccine availability (by 4 %) more than relieving storage bottlenecks at the district (1 % increase), central (no change), and clinic (no change) levels alone. Increasing transport frequency (or capacity) yielded far greater gains (e. g., 15 % increase in vaccine availability when doubling transport frequency to the district level and 18 % when tripling). In fact, relieving all <b>stationary</b> <b>storage</b> constraints could only increase vaccine availability by 11 %, whereas doubling the transport frequency throughout the system led to a 26 % increase and tripling the frequency led to a 30 % increase. Increasing transport frequency also reduced the amount of <b>stationary</b> <b>storage</b> space needed in the supply chain.

40|$|Connection of {{electric}} storage technologies to smartgrids will have substantial implications for building energy systems. Local storage will enable demand response. When connected to buildings, mobile storage {{devices such as}} electric vehicles (EVs) are in competition with conventional stationary sources at the building. EVs can change the financial as well as environmental attractiveness of on-site generation (e. g. PV or fuel cells). In order to {{examine the impact of}} EVs on building energy costs and CO 2 emissions, a distributed-energy-resources adoption problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program with minimization of annual building energy costs or CO 2 emissions and solved for 2020 technology assumptions. The mixedinteger linear program is applied to a set of 139 different commercial buildings in California and example results as well as the aggregated economic and environmental benefits are reported. Special constraints for the available PV, solar thermal, and EV parking lots at the commercial buildings are considered. The research shows that EV batteries can be used to reduce utility-related energy costs at the smart grid or commercial building due to arbitrage of energy between buildings with different tariffs. However, putting more emphasis on CO 2 emissions makes <b>stationary</b> <b>storage</b> more attractive and <b>stationary</b> <b>storage</b> capacities increase while the attractiveness of EVs decreases.
