5|$|As the Fragrant Hill project neared completion, Pei {{began work}} on the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City, for which his {{associate}} James Freed served as lead designer. Hoping to create a vibrant community institution {{in what was then}} a run-down neighborhood on Manhattan's west side, Freed developed a glass-coated structure with an intricate <b>space</b> <b>frame</b> of interconnected metal rods and spheres.|$|E
5|$|The {{convention}} center was plagued {{from the start}} by budget problems and construction blunders. City regulations forbid a general contractor having final authority over the project, so architects and program manager Richard Kahan had to coordinate the wide array of builders, plumbers, electricians, and other workers. The forged steel globes {{to be used in}} the <b>space</b> <b>frame</b> came to the site with hairline cracks and other defects; 12,000 were rejected. These and other problems led to media comparisons with the disastrous Hancock Tower. One New York City official blamed Kahan for the difficulties, indicating that the building's architectural flourishes were responsible for delays and financial crises. The Javits Center opened on 3 April 1986, to a generally positive reception. During the inauguration ceremonies, however, neither Freed nor Pei was recognized for their role in the project.|$|E
5|$|The target chamber is a two-wall {{structure}} {{filled with}} liquid lithium or a lithium alloy between the walls. The lithium captures neutrons from the reactions to breed tritium, and also {{acts as the}} primary coolant loop. The chamber is filled with xenon gas that would slow the ions from the reaction as well as protect the inner wall, or first wall, from the massive x-ray flux. Because the chamber is not highly pressurized, like a fission core, {{it does not have}} to be built as a single sphere. Instead, the LIFE chamber is built from eight identical sections that include built-in connections to the cooling loop. They are shipped to the plant and bolted together on two supports, and then surrounded by a tube-based <b>space</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a consistent formulation of a tangent stiffness matrix for the geometrically nonlinear {{analysis of the}} space beam-column elements allowing for axial-flexural, lateral-torsional and axial-torsional buckling. In the proposed formulation, three deformation matrices are derived for moderately large rotations in practical three-dimensional <b>space</b> <b>frames</b> subjected to axial force and moments. These matrices are functions of the element deformations and include the coupling among axial, lateral and torsional deformations. The proposed matrices are used together with linear and geometric stiffness matrices for beam elements to study the large deflection behavior of <b>space</b> <b>frames</b> which comprise members with negligible warping effects.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, the {{nonlinear}} seismic {{behavior of}} intermediate moment-resisting reinforced concrete (RC) <b>space</b> <b>frames</b> with unsymmetrical plan in three, {{four and five}} stories are evaluated. The plan configurations of these <b>space</b> <b>frames</b> contain reentrant corners. Analyses of these buildings are made with and without considering the masonry infill (MI). For infills, three types of arrangements and two material types (strong and weak) have been considered. For lateral seismic loads, two types of lateral loads distributions have been assumed. The results revealed {{that the existence of}} infill increases the stiffness and decreases the drifts. However, by omitting infills from the ground floor (the soft story arrangement), the beams and the columns of the ground floor show inferior performance...|$|R

25|$|Tange envisioned {{that the}} Expo should be {{primarily}} {{conceived as a}} big festival where human beings could meet. Central to the site he placed the Festival Plaza onto which were connected a number of themed displays, {{all of which were}} united under one huge roof. In his Tōkyō Bay Project Tange spoke about the living body having two types of information transmission systems: fluid and electronic. That project used the idea of a tree trunk and branches that would carry out those types of transmission in relation to the city. Kawazoe likened the <b>space</b> <b>frame</b> roof of the Festival Plaza to the electronic transmission system and the aerial-themed displays that plugged into it to the hormonal system.|$|E
25|$|Kawazoe, Maki and Kurokawa {{had invited}} a {{selection}} of world architects to design displays for the Mid-Air Exhibition {{that was to be}} incorporated within the roof. The architects included Moshe Safdie, Yona Friedman, Hans Hollein and Giancarlo De Carlo. Although Tange was obsessed with the theory of flexibility that the space framed provide he did concede that in reality it was not so practical for the actual fixing of the displays. The roof itself was designed by Koji Kamaya and Mamoru Kawaguchi who conceived it as a huge <b>space</b> <b>frame.</b> Kawaguchi invented a welding-free ball joint to safely distribute the load and worked out a method of assembling the frame on the ground before raising it using jacks.|$|E
25|$|The Palm House (1844–1848) was {{the result}} of {{cooperation}} between architect Decimus Burton and iron founder Richard Turner, and continues upon the glass house design principles developed by John Claudius Loudon and Joseph Paxton. A <b>space</b> <b>frame</b> of wrought iron arches, held together by horizontal tubular structures containing long prestressed cables, supports glass panes which were originally tinted green with copper oxide to reduce the significant heating effect. The 19m high central nave is surrounded by a walkway at 9m height, allowing visitors a closer look upon the palm tree crowns. In front of the Palm House on the east side are the Queen's Beasts, ten statues of animals bearing shields.

40|$|The inelastic dynamic {{response}} of steel <b>space</b> <b>frames</b> with tensile bracing members is studied {{by a new}} numerical method.

The restoring forces of the frame are obtained by solving whole structure considering {{the influence of the}} large deformation of the frame and the axial deformation of columns by an advanced plastic hinge method.

25|$|Biosphere 2 was {{originally}} meant {{to demonstrate the}} viability of closed ecological systems to support and maintain human life in outer space, defining mission one as eight humans for two years. Additionally, it served to explore the web of interactions within life systems in a structure with five areas based on biomes, and an agricultural area and human living and working space to study the interactions between humans, farming, and technology {{with the rest of}} nature. It also explored the use of closed biospheres in space colonization, and allowed the study and manipulation of a biosphere without harming Earth's. Its five biome areas were a 1,900 square meter rainforest, an 850 square meter ocean with a coral reef, a 450 square meter mangrove wetlands, a 1,300 square meter savannah grassland, a 1,400 square meter fog desert, a 2,500 square meter agricultural system, a human habitat, and a below-ground infrastructure.
