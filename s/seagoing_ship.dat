500|$|Large {{seagoing}} {{ships are}} known to have been heavily used by the Egyptians in their trade with the city states of the eastern Mediterranean, especially Byblos (on the coast of modern-day Lebanon), and in several expeditions down the Red Sea to the Land of Punt. In fact one of the earliest Egyptian words for a <b>seagoing</b> <b>ship</b> is a [...] "Byblos Ship", which originally defined a class of Egyptian seagoing ships used on the Byblos run; however, {{by the end of the}} Old Kingdom, the term had come to include large seagoing ships, whatever their destination.|$|E

50|$|Coasters, smaller ships for any {{category}} of cargo which are normally not on ocean-crossing routes, but in coastwise trades. Coasters are shallow-hulled ships used for trade between locations {{on the same}} island or continent.

2500|$|To {{negotiate}} Sabine Pass {{all vessels}} except small boats {{took one of}} the two river channels, both of about 5 feet (1.5 meters) depth and one {{on each side of the}} Pass. [...] These channels were separated by naturally formed [...] "oyster-banks" [...] known to be barely two feet (0.60 meter) under the surface. [...] No <b>seagoing</b> <b>ship</b> could traverse the Pass without great risk of going aground, if it did not follow one of the channels. The inevitable course of any steam-powered warship—including shallow-draft gunboats then common to the U.S. Navy—would necessarily use one of the channels, both of which were within fair range of the fort's six smoothbores.|$|E
2500|$|West Hosokie {{was built}} in Seattle, Washington in 1918 at the No. 1 Plant of the Skinner & Eddy Corporation—the 14th {{in a series of}} 24 Design 1013 cargo ships built by Skinner & Eddy for the USSBs {{emergency}} wartime shipbuilding program. The ship was laid down on June 11, launched 54 working (65 calendar) days later on 15 August and completed on 29 August—a total time under construction of 65 working (79 calendar) days, putting West Hosokie into the record books as the fourth-fastest built <b>seagoing</b> <b>ship</b> of the war, and the second fastest ship (behind sister ship West Lianga) of more than 5,500 deadweight tons.|$|E

50|$|St Michael was a <b>seagoing</b> <b>ship</b> that traded between New South Wales and Pacific Islands in {{the early}} 1820s. In 1826 some Sydney merchants {{converted}} the vessel into a store ship and moored it in the Hunter River at Morpeth. Goods of every description were sold and farm produce stored until taken by other ships to Sydney markets. St Michael was the only such facility at Morpeth for several years.|$|E
50|$|By contrast, London was a port, {{served by}} already-navigable rivers like the Thames and the River Lea, (which was canalised). It needed canals only to take goods {{in and out}} from <b>seagoing</b> <b>ships,</b> where such rivers were unavailable.|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} {{paper is to}} focus the problem of carbon dioxide {{emission}} from <b>seagoing</b> <b>ships.</b> The paper presents analysis of possibilities of fuel consumption minimizing and this way reduction of carbon dioxide emission from <b>seagoing</b> <b>ships.</b> However, The VI Amendment to MARPOL Convention concerning prevention against air pollution by <b>seagoing</b> <b>ships</b> did not take into consideration carbon dioxide emission, {{the importance of this}} problem was perceived by international organizations among others by IMO. As a result corrections in VI Amendment to MARPOL Convention were introduced thus forcing reduction of CO 2 emission by <b>seagoing</b> <b>ships.</b> Among means reducing emission of carbon dioxide into atmosphere the following are mentioned: construction modifications of new built ships i. e. reduction of ship speed, optimization of main engine and propeller selection, optimization of ship hull shape, application of resistance reducing hull coatings, use of alternative (ecological) fuels and utilization of propulsion plant waste heat. In turn, for ships already in operation methods for fuel consumption and carbon dioxide reduction can be individual for each ship full monitoring of main engine operational parameters and measurement of waste heat utilization rate. According to opinion of paper authors, the minimizing of carbon dioxide reduction can be mainly achieved by utilisation of exhaust gases heat for electric power production in steam turbo alternators running in one- or two stage steam pressure systems. The analysis executed in the paper of one- and two stage steam system advantages shows that one stage steam system is more economically profitable in practice application...|$|R

The ship was notable as being British Rail's first <b>seagoing</b> <b>ship</b> to be fitted with a bow door and therefore, was the very first Sealink drive-through ferry. She also broke with the Company's long {{tradition}} of using steam turbine propulsion for its channel vessels, a move that introduced the funnel design that was to become synonymous with British Rail and later Sealink ferries.|$|E

The equipping of the Verrebroek Dock started in 1996 and saw the arrival of its first <b>seagoing</b> <b>ship</b> in 2000. When finalized, this dock will offer a total of 5 km of berths with a draught of 14.5 m.|$|E
50|$|Construction of Gdynia seaport {{was started}} in 1921, but because of {{financial}} difficulties was conducted slowly and with interruptions. It was accelerated after the Sejm (Polish parliament) passed the Gdynia Seaport Construction Act on 23 September 1922. By 1923 a 550-metre pier, 175 m of a wooden tide breaker, and a small harbour had been constructed. Ceremonial inauguration of Gdynia as a temporary military port and fishers' shelter took place on 23 April 1923, and the first major <b>seagoing</b> <b>ship</b> arrived on 13 August 1923.|$|E
50|$|The European Union {{has its own}} set of {{emissions}} standards that all new vehicles must meet. Currently, standards are set for all road vehicles, trains, barges and 'nonroad mobile machinery' (such as tractors). No standards apply to <b>seagoing</b> <b>ships</b> or airplanes.|$|R

50|$|These 6 ships (of 26 planned) ordered {{under the}} 1935 Program were {{improved}} and enlarged {{versions of the}} 1934 and 1934A classes.

Despite this, five of this newer type were also lost at Narvik in April 1940.|$|R
