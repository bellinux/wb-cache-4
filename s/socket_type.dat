5|$|Protosuchians were small, mostly {{terrestrial}} animals with short snouts and long limbs. They had bony armor {{in the form}} of two rows of plates extending from head to tail, and this armor is retained by most modern crocodilians. Their vertebrae were convex on the two main articulating surfaces, and their bony palates were little developed. The mesosuchians saw a fusion of the palatine bones to form a secondary bony palate and a great extension of the nasal passages to near the pterygoid bones. This allowed the animal to breathe through its nostrils while its mouth was open under the water. The eusuchians continued this process with the interior nostrils now opening through an aperture in the pterygoid bones. The vertebrae of eusuchians had one convex and one concave articulating surface, allowing for a ball and <b>socket</b> <b>type</b> joint between the vertebrae, bringing greater flexibility and strength. The oldest known eusuchian is Hylaeochampsa vectiana from the lower Cretaceous of the Isle of Wight in the United Kingdom. It was followed by crocodilians such as the Pristichampsidae, the so-called 'hoofed crocodiles', in the Palaeogene. Spanning the Cretaceous and Palaeogene periods is the genus Borealosuchus of North America, with six species, though its phylogenetic position is not settled.|$|E
25|$|A system {{widely used}} in Europe known as the Mullard–Philips tube designation, also {{extended}} to transistors, uses a letter, followed {{by one or more}} further letters, and a number. The type designator specifies the heater voltage or current (one letter), the functions of all sections of the tube (one letter per section), the <b>socket</b> <b>type</b> (first digit), and the particular tube (remaining digits). For example, the ECC83 (equivalent to the 12AX7) is a 6.3V (E) double triode (CC) with a miniature base (8). In this system special-quality tubes (e.g., for long-life computer use) are indicated by moving the number immediately after the first letter: the E83CC is a special-quality equivalent of the ECC83, the E55L a power pentode with no consumer equivalent.|$|E

50|$|In North America and {{continental}} Europe, Edison screws displaced other <b>socket</b> <b>types</b> {{for general}} lighting.

50|$|The yellow P+N+E, 4h (120°) plug is {{a single}} phase {{connector}} that is in widespread use on the British Isles for 110 V building site and fairground applications. A popular model of this <b>socket</b> <b>type</b> is marketed under the brand name MK Commando which leads some users to refer to all all IEC 60309 sockets by the generic trademark Commando sockets.|$|E
50|$|Many <b>socket</b> <b>types</b> {{and sizes}} are {{available}} with a universal joint between the socket and the ratchet attachment for tightening or loosening fasteners which {{are not easy to}} access with the socket wrench plus standard socket arrangement. Also available are short universal joint extensions that allow any socket to be attached to a ratchet at with a universal joint between the two. Wobble extensions can serve the same purpose and may be easier to use since they often give a more solid socket attachment without all the flexing common to universal joint sockets.|$|R
50|$|Sockets Direct Protocol only {{deals with}} stream sockets, and if {{installed}} in a system, bypasses the OS resident TCP stack for stream connections between any endpoints on the RDMA fabric. All other <b>socket</b> <b>types</b> (such as datagram, raw, packet, etc.) are supported by the Linux IP stack and operate over standard IP interfaces (i.e., IPoIB on InfiniBand fabrics). The IP stack has no dependency on the SDP stack; however, the SDP stack depends on IP drivers for local IP assignments and for IP address resolution for endpoint identifications.|$|R
25|$|Consolidation of {{standards}} eases {{international trade and}} travel. For example, the CEE7/7 plug has been adopted in several European countries and is compatible with both CEE7/3 and CEE7/5 sockets, while the unearthed and unpolarised CEE 7/16 Europlug is compatible with even more European and other <b>socket</b> <b>types.</b> IEC 60906-1 has been proposed as a common standard for all 230 V plugs and sockets worldwide but has been adopted only in South Africa so far, with a modified version used in Brazil.
