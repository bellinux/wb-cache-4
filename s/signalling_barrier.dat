40|$|Abstract As network latency rapidly {{approaches}} {{thousands of}} processor cycles and multiprocessors systems be-come larger and larger, the primary {{factor in determining}} a barrier algorithm's performance {{is the number of}} serialized network latencies it requires. All existing barrier algorithms require at least ΘΞΛΣΠΦΥΩΨ fiffffifl roundtrip message latencies to perform a single barrier operation on an ff-node shared memory multiprocessor. In addition, existing barrier algorithms are not well tuned in terms of how they interact with modern sharedmemory systems, which leads to an excessive number of message exchanges to <b>signal</b> <b>barrier</b> completion...|$|R
50|$|Tethers may break {{by various}} means; if a tether is a signal, then {{interruption}} by <b>signal</b> <b>barriers</b> breaks the tether. If the tether is a cord or rope, then upon reaching the breaking {{strength of the}} tether, the tether fails in its function. Failure modes for tethers are considered when designing arrangements where a tether is needed. When a tether or line breaks suddenly, backlash of the segments may cause severe damage or loss of life. Safety links are sometimes used to prevent excessive tension in a tether involved in towing objects or persons, like in the towing of sailplanes; the safety link in a tether is thus a tether itself.|$|R
40|$|Preliminary Draft. Do not quote. Two advocates with {{opposing}} interests provide costly {{information to}} a voter who must choose between two policies. Players are symmetrically informed and information flows continuously as long as either advocate is willing to uncur its cost. In the unique subgame perfect equilibrium, an advocate’s probability of winning is decreasing in his cost. When costs are different, increasing the low-cost advocate’s cost benefits the voter. We analyze court proceedings with our model and show that the optimal burden of proof favors the high-cost advocate.

This consisted of a folded dipole with a passive director in front of it, both bent rearward at about 35 degrees, projecting from the nosecone on a mounting rod. For vertical reception, the receiver antennas consisted of two half-wave unipoles mounted above and below the wing, with a reflector behind them. The wing acted as a <b>signal</b> <b>barrier,</b> allowing the antennas to see only the portion of the sky above or below the wing as well as directly in front.

Inflammatory bowel disease is typically associated with a decrease in local pH, which may lead to altered epithelial barrier function and subsequent gastrointestinal repair involving epithelial cell adhesion and migration. As the mechanisms underlying the response to pH changes are not well understood, we have investigated OGR 1 -mediated, pH-dependent signaling pathways in intestinal epithelial cells. Caco- 2 cells stably overexpressing OGR 1 were created and validated as tools to study OGR 1 <b>signaling.</b> <b>Barrier</b> function, migration, and proliferation were measured using electric cell-substrate impedance-sensing technology. Localization of the tight junction proteins zonula occludens protein 1 and occludin and the rearrangement of cytoskeletal actin were examined by confocal microscopy. Paracellular permeability and protein and gene expression analysis using DNA microarrays were performed on filter-grown Caco- 2 monolayers. We report that an acidic pH shift from pH 7. 8 to 6. 6 improved barrier function and stimulated reorganization of filamentous actin with prominent basal stress fiber formation. Cell migration and proliferation during in vitro wound healing were inhibited. Gene expression analysis revealed significant upregulation of genes related to cytoskeleton remodeling, cell adhesion, and growth factor signaling. We conclude that acidic extracellular pH can have a signaling function and impact the physiology of intestinal epithelial cells.

40|$|SummaryNorrin/Frizzled 4 (Fz 4) {{signaling}} activates {{the canonical}} Wnt pathway to control retinal vascular development. Using genetically engineered mice, {{we show that}} precocious Norrin production leads to premature retinal vascular invasion and delayed Norrin production leads to characteristic defects in intraretinal vascular architecture. In genetic mosaics, wild-type endothelial cells (ECs) instruct neighboring Fz 4 −/− ECs to produce an architecturally normal mosaic vasculature, a cell nonautonomous effect. However, over the ensuing weeks, Fz 4 −/− ECs are selectively eliminated from the mosaic vasculature, implying {{the existence of a}} quality control program that targets defective ECs. In the adult retina and cerebellum, gain or loss of Norrin/Fz 4 signaling results in a cell-autonomous gain or loss, respectively, of blood retina barrier and blood brain barrier function, indicating an ongoing requirement for Frizzled <b>signaling</b> in <b>barrier</b> maintenance and substantial plasticity in mature CNS vascular structure.

40|$|Lung {{inflammation}} and alterations in endothelial cell (EC) permeability are key events to development of acute lung injury (ALI). Protective effects of {{atrial natriuretic peptide}} (ANP) have been shown against inflammatory <b>signaling</b> and endothelial <b>barrier</b> dysfunction induced by gram-negative bacterial wall liposaccharide. We hypothesized that ANP may possess more general protective effects and attenuate lung {{inflammation and}} EC barrier dysfunction by suppressing inflammatory cascades and barrier-disruptive mechanisms shared by gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens. C 57 BL/ 6 J wild-type or ANP knockout mice (Nppa−/−) were treated with gram-positive bacterial cell wall compounds, Staphylococcus aureus-derived peptidoglycan (PepG) and/or lipoteichoic acid (LTA) (intratracheal, 2. 5 mg/kg each), with or without ANP (intravenous, 2 μg/kg). In vitro, human pulmonary EC barrier properties were assessed by morphological analysis of gap formation and measurements of transendothelial electrical resistance. LTA and PepG markedly increased pulmonary EC permeability and activated p 38 and ERK 1 / 2 MAP kinases, NF-κB, and Rho/Rho kinase <b>signaling.</b> EC <b>barrier</b> dysfunction was further elevated upon combined LTA and PepG treatment, but abolished by ANP pretreatment. In vivo, LTA and PepG-induced accumulation of protein and cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, tissue neutrophil infiltration, and increased Evans blue extravasation in the lungs was significantly attenuated by intravenous injection of ANP. Accumulation of bronchoalveolar lavage markers of LTA/PepG-induced lung inflammation and barrier dysfunction was further augmented in ANP−/− mice and attenuated by exogenous ANP injection. These results strongly suggest a protective role of ANP in the in vitro and in vivo models of ALI associated with gram-positive infection. Thus ANP may have important implications in therapeutic strategies aimed at the treatment of sepsis and ALI-induced gram-positive bacterial pathogens...|$|R
50|$|A {{possible}} mechanistic explanation linking gut flora to obesity involves short chain fatty acids. Humans {{are unable}} to digest complex polysaccharides and rely on gut microbiota to ferment these polysaccharides into short chain fatty acids. In contrast to polysaccharides, humans can use short chain fatty acids {{as a source of}} energy. In addition, research in rodents has indicated that the abundance of short chain fatty acids in the gut can affect the blood levels of gut hormones such as GLP-1, GLP-2 and peptide YY. These changes in gut hormone levels have shown to affect glucose tolerance, insulin <b>signaling,</b> intestinal <b>barrier</b> function and have led to weight gain in rodents. Furthermore, administration of antibiotics to rodents alters gut microbiota composition and ensuing changes in gut hormone levels are also detected.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Overcoming <b>signal</b> {{resolution}} <b>barriers</b> {{of neural}} prostheses, {{such as the}} commercially available cochlear impant (CI) or the developing retinal implant, will likely require spatial control of regenerative neural elements. To rationally design materials that direct nerve growth, {{it is first necessary}} to determine pathfinding behavior of de novo neurite growth from prosthesis-relevant cells such as spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) in the inner ear. Accordingly, in this work, repeating 90 ° turns were fabricated as multidirectional micropatterns to determine SGN neurite turning capability and pathfinding. Unidirectional micropatterns and unpatterned substrates are used as comparisons. Spiral ganglion Schwann cell alignment (SGSC) is also examined on each surface type. Micropatterns are fabricated using the spatial reaction control inherent to photopolymerization with photomasks that have either parallel line spacing gratings for unidirectional patterns or repeating 90 ° angle steps for multidirectional patterns.

40|$|The Treatment Support Measure (TSM) Parent and Youth {{were created}} to help clinicians with {{actionable}} feedback when youths are not making sufficient progress in treatment. This study examined {{the psychometric properties of}} the Dutch TSM Parent and TSM Youth. Parents (n = 172) and youth (n = 122) were recruited at 2 outpatient mental health care institutions. Children of participating parents (50. 6 % boys) had a mean age of 11. 9 years (SD = 3. 46; range 4 - 18). Participating youth (30. 3 % boys) had a mean age of 15. 68 years (SD = 1. 75; range 12 - 18). Participants were asked to complete the TSM and questionnaires measuring related constructs once during treatment. Responses to the TSM Parent items were explained by 9 instead of 5 subscales, and responses to the TSM Youth items were explained by 8 instead of 4 subscales. The internal consistency reliability of both the TSM Parent and the TSM Youth scales was generally good. The convergent validity of the TSM Parent and the TSM Youth was also good, although the divergent validity was less convincing. The criterion validity was inconclusive; the TSM Parent was not able to differentiate between problematic and nonproblematic treatments, but multiple scales of the TSM Youth were able to differentiate between these groups. The TSM Parent and TSM Youth have potential to be helpful tools in clinical practice.

40|$|Protease-activated {{receptor}}- 1 (PAR 1) is a G-protein–coupled receptor uniquely {{activated by}} proteolysis. Thrombin, a coagulant protease, induces inflammatory responses and endothelial barrier permeability through the activation of PAR 1. Activated protein C (APC), an anti-coagulant protease, also activates PAR 1. However, unlike thrombin, APC elicits anti-inflammatory responses and protects against endothelial barrier dysfunction induced by thrombin. We found that thrombin and APC signaling {{were lost in}} PAR 1 -deficient endothelial cells, indicating that PAR 1 is the major effector of protease signaling. To delineate the mechanism responsible for protease-selective signaling by PAR 1, we examined the effect of APC and thrombin on the activation of RhoA and Rac 1, small GTPases that differentially regulate endothelial barrier permeability. Thrombin caused robust RhoA signaling but not Rac 1 activation, whereas APC stimulated a marked increase in Rac 1 activation but not RhoA signaling, consistent with the opposing functions of these proteases on endothelial barrier integrity. Strikingly, APC <b>signaling</b> and endothelial <b>barrier</b> protection effects were abolished in cells lacking caveolin- 1, whereas thrombin signaling remained intact. These findings suggest that compartmentalization of PAR 1 in caveolae is critical for APC selective signaling to Rac 1 activation and endothelial barrier protection. We further report that APC induces PAR 1 phosphorylation and desensitizes endothelial cells to thrombin signaling but promotes limited receptor cleavage and negligible internalization and degradation even after prolonged APC exposure. Thus, APC selective <b>signaling</b> and endothelial <b>barrier</b> protective effects are mediated through compartmentalization of PAR 1 in caveolae and a novel mechanism of PAR 1 signal regulation...|$|R

One of the Riemann invariants of the reduced modulation system determines the characteristics of a soliton interacting with an initial mean flow that results in soliton tunneling or trapping.
