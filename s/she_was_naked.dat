5|$|Gemma Rose Adams aged 25, born in Kesgrave, {{was last}} seen on West End Road in Ipswich, {{where she had been}} living; she {{disappeared}} on 15 November at about 01.15 (UTC). Her body was found on 2 December, in a river at Hintlesham. The first victim found, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>naked</b> but had not been sexually assaulted.|$|E
5|$|Excavators {{found the}} body of the Haraldskær Woman in a supine {{position}} in an excellent state of preservation. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>naked</b> and her clothes, consisting of a leather cape and three woolen garments, had been placed on top of her. Hurdles of branches and wooden poles pinned the body down. The complete skin envelope and the internal organs were both intact. The body had a lancing wound to the knee joint area, where some object (possibly one of the sharp poles) penetrated to some depth. Her skin was deeply bronzed with a robust skin tone due to tannins in the peat, and all the body joints were preserved with overlying skin in a state as if she had died only recently. Doctors determined she had been about 50 years old when she died and in good health without signs of degenerative diseases (such as arthritis) which are typically found in human remains of that age.|$|E
500|$|Harris was {{followed}} into the witness-box by {{a succession of}} landladies, waitresses and other women, all of whom confirmed Davidson's habitual pestering without making any serious accusation of misconduct. [...] When Davidson himself took to the stand, on 25 May, his light-hearted, even flippant, manner created, says Tucker, [...] "the flavour of a comedy routine with the rector's counsel as straight man". Davidson's disastrous finances were aired—he took great offence when his association with Gordon was presented as a [...] "partnership in crime". [...] He caused disbelief and amusement in the court when, questioned about the boil-lancing incident with Rose Ellis, he professed not to know what a [...] "buttock" [...] was, claiming: [...] "It is a phrase I have honestly never heard. So far as I remember {{it is a little}} below the waist." [...] At this stage, only Harris's largely uncorroborated testimony had provided specific allegations of immorality; the rest of the evidence was inconclusive and it seemed that the prosecution might fail. Davidson's cause was severely damaged, however, when Oliver produced a photograph of him, taken on 28 March 1932, with a nearly naked girl. She was Estelle Douglas, the 15-year-old daughter of one of Davidson' oldest friends. Davidson explained that the picture had been intended as a publicity shot to help the girl find work as an actress. He protested that he had been set up, and did not know <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>naked</b> under her shawl; he thought she was wearing a bathing suit, as she had been in an earlier photograph. [...] On 6 June, after closing speeches from both sides, the court adjourned until 8 July to allow the chancellor, who alone would determine the outcome, to consider the evidence.|$|E
50|$|La Ciguapa: is {{a female}} {{character}} who comes out at night. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>naked</b> with very long black hair, and her feet <b>are</b> backwards. <b>She</b> enchants {{the men she}} comes across.|$|R
50|$|It is a loose {{remake of}} the 1937 film Seven Slaps. A young woman slaps the board of a bank she {{believes}} has swindled {{her out of her}} money. In a change from the earlier film, and as part of director Thiele's growing move towards sex comedies, <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>naked</b> when <b>she</b> does so.|$|R
25|$|The {{gatekeeper}} lets Ishtar {{into the}} underworld, opening one gate at a time. At each gate, Ishtar {{is forced to}} shed one article of clothing.

2500|$|Anjelica's decomposing {{body was}} {{discovered}} on July 23, 1991, inside a navy blue cooler along the Henry Hudson Parkway in Manhattan, New York. The body was so decomposed that identification was at first impossible, as her face was not recognizableshe soon {{came to be known}} as [...] "Baby Hope". <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>naked</b> and had been bound with both rope and a Venetian blind cord. She was placed in a fetal position with her hands pressed together. The body was then wrapped in a garbage bag and placed inside the cooler, which was filled with unopened soda cans and water (which was presumably ice at one time). Examiners concluded that [...] "Baby Hope" [...] was possibly Hispanic, had dark, wavy hair in a ponytail, was malnourished, weighing only , was a victim of sexual abuse, and had died on-or-about July 18. She was initially estimated to have been between three and five years old.|$|E
2500|$|Bluhm {{was also}} charged with being an {{accessory}} {{after the fact}} when he admitted to investigators he saw Willis with Heeringa's body and helped him bury her after she was sexually assaulted. Bluhm said Willis called him the day after Heeringa's disappearance {{and said he had}} a woman and there was a party. Bluhm told police he saw Heeringa with an obvious head wound, face down, hands out, and tied. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>naked</b> and wasn't moving. He also told police he knew that [...] "Jeff had been following or watching Ms. Heeringa, and that he hit her … which made her go unconscious to get her in the van," [...] and that Willis had sex and used sexual toys and torture. [...] He told investigators he and Willis wrapped Heeringa up in a sheet and drove her to an area on Sheridan Rd near Laketon Rd, where Willis had already placed shovels, and buried her in a hole that was already dug. Bluhm has been suspended without pay from his job as a sergeant at the West Shoreline Correctional Facility, a state prison in Muskegon Heights. The judge set Bluhm's bond at $100,000 and ordered that he wear a tether if he posts bond and is released.|$|E
60|$|Down {{the room}} {{she heard the}} rapid firing of questions. She stood before her class {{not knowing what to}} do. She waited painfully. Her block of children, fifty unknown faces, watched her, hostile, ready to jeer. She {{felt as if she were}} in torture over a fire of faces. And on every side <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>naked</b> to them. Of unutterable length and torture the seconds went by.|$|E

6000|$|She obeyed--as always, {{without a}} word. He led her {{half a mile}} from the house, and {{proceeded}} to lash her to a tree {{by the side of the}} public road; and succeeded, she screaming and struggling. He gagged her then, struck her across the face with his cowhide, and set his bloodhounds on her. They tore the clothes off her, and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>naked.</b> He called the dogs off, and said: ...|$|E
60|$|They {{laid the}} body in a shed, made fast their horses, and came into the house, and the door was closed again. So there they sat about the lights, and there was little said, for they were none so well pleased with their reception. Presently, {{in the place where}} the food was kept, began a {{clattering}} of dishes; and it fell to a bondman of the house to go and see what made the clatter. He was no sooner gone than he was back again; and told it was a big, buxom woman, high in flesh and naked as she was born, setting meats upon a dresser. Finnward grew pale as the dawn; he got to his feet, and the rest rose with him, and all the party of the funeral came to the buttery-door. And the dead Thorgunna took no heed of their coming, but went on setting forth meats, and seemed to talk with herself as she did so; and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>naked</b> to the buff.|$|E
60|$|This day he {{came upon}} {{a woman and her}} child farther down stream than usual. The former was searching for a species of {{shellfish}} which was {{to be found in the}} mud close to the river bank. She was a young black woman of about thirty. Her teeth were filed to sharp points, for her people ate the flesh of man. Her under lip was slit that it might support a rude pendant of copper which she had worn for so many years that the lip had been dragged downward to prodigious lengths, exposing the teeth and gums of her lower jaw. Her nose, too, was slit, and through the slit was a wooden skewer. Metal ornaments dangled from her ears, and upon her forehead and cheeks; upon her chin and the bridge of her nose were tattooings in colors that were mellowed now by age. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>naked</b> except for a girdle of grasses about her waist. Altogether she was very beautiful in her own estimation and even in the estimation of the men of Mbonga's tribe, though she was of another people--a trophy of war seized in her maidenhood by one of Mbonga's fighting men.|$|E

50|$|The plot of {{the film}} centers on a female sexologist who wishes to finance and produce a pornographic film. As the film {{progresses}} it is revealed that the doctor may have an ulterior goal in coaxing her actors into their drugged and sexually frenzied states. Ultimately the doctor persuades a man to dress in an ox costume and penetrate her vaginally while <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>naked</b> inside a wooden cow.|$|R
5000|$|On French & Saunders, Jennifer Saunders parodied Morissette with a {{song called}} [...] "Bless U", a tribute to thesauri, dictionaries, spell check and other word {{referencing}} methods. The clip showed Saunders as a singer called Aimless Morris Minor, dressed in a flesh-coloured body-suit {{to make it appear}} as if <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>naked.</b> At the end of the sketch Dawn French stuck the pubic hair of the suit onto Saunders's face. This clip was shown as a sketch on French and Saunders 1999 Bank Holiday Special.|$|R

50|$|After Armstrong seduces Isobel, {{he confesses}} to Roget that he feigned love for Isobel because {{then she would}} agree to have {{intercourse}} with him. If <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>naked,</b> then he can examine her twisted spine more thoroughly. Isobel overhears and is moved to kill herself by hanging. Armstrong finds her hanging and speeds up the process. The characters in 1799 ring {{in the new year}} with the death of Isobel, whereas, the characters in 1999 begin the new millennium leaving their old home, and the certainties it possessed for them, behind.|$|R

In the morning, cars are revving up for the start but the two have overslept. Emerging from the bathroom, Marc pulls the bedding off Michèle to find that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>naked</b> and waiting for him. The film ends at that moment, leaving viewers to assume that Marc {{is going to find}} a relationship with Michèle more rewarding than rallying.|$|R

5000|$|Showing {{respect to}} his wife and his faith, Caviezel refused to do a love scene with Jennifer Lopez in Angel Eyes since <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>naked,</b> and he refused to strip off in a love scene with Ashley Judd in High Crimes. He said, [...] "I do love scenes - but not ones with {{gratuitous}} sex. ... And it’s not just about my wife, although that’s important. It’s sin, pure and simple. I mean, it’s wrong. ... It’s awkward." ...|$|E

They then went away to discuss the story, and Sarah didn't look too happy coming back onto the shoot.|$|E
