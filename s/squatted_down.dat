25|$|Chesney {{started his}} Poets and Pirates Tour on April 26, 2008 at Williams-Brice Stadium in Columbia, South Carolina. During the {{introduction}} of his set, his boot got caught between a hydraulic lift and {{the lip of the}} stage surface, which crushed his foot and produced a severe hematoma from the ankle down, with most of the damage centering within his toes. It took approximately 30seconds to pry his foot loose as he <b>squatted</b> <b>down</b> on the stage while the band continued to play an extended introduction of the song. When Chesney finally freed himself, he stood up and kept holding his hand on his knee as he began singing.|$|E
500|$|With most athletes having {{switched}} to the V-style, the sport was about to reach one of its biggest ever milestones. During the training round on {{the opening day of}} the event, Martin HÃ¶llwarth jumped [...] to edge the world record ever closer to 200m. This was the first time a world record had been set using the V-style, with Piotr Fijas' being the last to use the parallel style. Andreas Goldberger got tantalisingly close to the magic number when he landed at [...] but failed to maintain his balance as he <b>squatted</b> <b>down</b> and touched the snow with his hands, rendering his jump an unofficial world record. The official honours went to Toni Nieminen only a short time later, who cleanly landed a history-making jump of [...] to claim both the world record and the achievement of being the first ever ski jumper to break the 200m barrier.|$|E
40|$|Bending {{forward and}} <b>squatting</b> <b>down</b> are two common {{physical}} tasks {{in everyday life}} and at work. This study determined the sEMG characteristics between erector spinae and vastus lateralis during bending forward and <b>squatting</b> <b>down</b> tasks by analyzing the regularity of variation in sEMG frequency domain index-median frequency (MNF) in healthy subjects. The results indicate that sEMG activities in erector spinae are significantly higher {{than those in the}} right vastus lateralis during bending forward task. Instead, in <b>squatting</b> <b>down</b> task, sEMG activities in the right vastus lateralis are significantly greater than those in erector spinae. It also shows that the fatigue degree of low back caused by trunk bending is much deeper than that by <b>squatting</b> <b>down.</b> The ratio scope of one-order fitting values of MNF between erector spinae and vastus lateralis ranges from 0. 87 to 1. 72 among 80 % of subjects during bending forward task and ranges from 0. 31 to 1. 11 during <b>squatting</b> <b>down</b> task. This study provides certain theoretical basis for using the strength of low back in a proper way to avoid getting it hurt in daily physical activities...|$|R

500|$|After Watermelon Man {{proved to}} be a {{financial}} success, Van Peebles was offered a three-picture contract. While the deal was still up in the air, Van Peebles- still wanting to create the first black power film- developed the story for Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song. The initial idea for the film did not come clearly to him at first. One day, Van Peebles drove into the Mojave desert, turned off the highway, and drove over the rise of a hill. He parked the car, got out, and <b>squatted</b> <b>down</b> facing the sun. [...] He decided that the film was going to be [...] "about a brother getting the Man's foot out of his ass."...Is!. Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song DVD, Xenon Entertainment Group, 2003. [...] Because no studio would finance the film, Van Peebles put his own money into the production, and shot it independently. Van Peebles was given a $50,000 loan by Bill Cosby to complete the film. [...] "Cosby didn't want an equity part," [...] according to Van Peebles. [...] "He just wanted his money back." [...] Van Peebles wound up with controlling ownership of the film. Several actors auditioned for the lead role of Sweetback, but told Van Peebles that they wouldn't do the film unless they were given more dialogue. Van Peebles ended up playing the part himself.|$|E
