5|$|Damage to {{the optic}} nerve (II) affects <b>specific</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> vision {{that depend on}} the {{location}} of the lesion. A person {{may not be able to}} see objects on their left or right sides (homonymous hemianopsia), or may have difficulty seeing objects on their outer visual fields (bitemporal hemianopsia) if the optic chiasm is involved. Vision may be tested by examining the visual field, or by examining the retina with an ophthalmoscope, using a process known as funduscopy. Visual field testing may be used to pin-point structural lesions in the optic nerve, or further along the visual pathways.|$|E
5|$|De temporibus, or On Time, {{written in}} about 703, {{provides}} {{an introduction to}} the principles of Easter computus. This was based on parts of Isidore of Seville's Etymologies, and Bede also included a chronology of the world which was derived from Eusebius, with some revisions based on Jerome's translation of the bible. In about 723, Bede wrote a longer work on the same subject, On the Reckoning of Time, which was influential throughout the Middle Ages.

5|$|Early in {{this section}} Heilmann embarks on a {{thorough}} description of the Berlin Archaeopteryx specimen, which includes detailed comparisons to <b>specific</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> modern birds. Following a comparison of its skull to that of Aetosaurus, Euparkeria, and a modern pigeon, Heilmann states that he disagrees with the scientific consensus {{of the time that}} the skull of Archaeopteryx is that of a true bird. He writes that the reptilian features of the skull are much more pronounced, citing features of the teeth, fenestrae, and jaw structure as being undeniably un-birdlike. Heilmann found that much of Archaeopteryxs anatomy, in fact, was decidedly reptilian and generally opposed to that of modern birds. This included the pelvis, which lacks a pectineal process and has a very different os sacrum from modern birds, as well as the carpus, which Heilmann wrote exhibited the same phenomena found in the wrists of modern reptiles. Its tail was also noted by Heilmann as being extremely reptilian and resembling nothing known of modern birds.|$|E

25|$|Many bandurists and kobzars were {{systematically}} persecuted by {{the authorities}} controlling Ukraine at various times.

Much of the unique repertoire of the kobzars idealized the legacy of the Ukrainian Cossacks. A significant section of the repertoire consisted of para-liturgical chants (kanty) and psalms sung by the kobzari outside of churches as the latter were often suspicious of, and sometimes hostile to, the kobzars' moral authority.|$|E

25|$|Cannabinoid binding sites exist {{throughout}} {{the central and}} peripheral nervous systems. The two most relevant receptors for cannabinoids are the CB1 and CB2 receptors, which are expressed predominantly {{in the brain and}} immune system respectively. Density of expression varies based on species and correlates with the efficacy that cannabinoids will have in modulating <b>specific</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> behavior related to the site of expression. For example, in rodents, the highest concentration of cannabinoid binding sites are in the basal ganglia and cerebellum, regions of the brain involved in the initiation and coordination of movement. In humans, cannabinoid receptors exist in much lower concentration in these regions, which helps explain why cannabinoids possess a greater efficacy in altering rodent motor movements than they do in humans.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the questions raised about the depth of EscrivÃ¡'s spirituality and theological thinking, about his purported habits of secretiveness and elitism (although, for the most part, Opus Dei faithful belong to the middle-to-low levels of society, in terms of education, income, and social status), about his alleged bad temper and ambition for social status and worldly luxuries, several other <b>specific</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> EscrivÃ¡'s life and work have generated some criticism, particularly regarding his canonization by the Catholic Church. These sources of criticism include his alleged private statements in defense of Adolf Hitler, collaboration by members of Opus Dei with right-wing political causes (especially during General Francisco Franco's dictatorship in Spain), EscrivÃ¡'s request for the rehabilitation in his favor of an aristocratic title, and allegations that he maintained bad relations with other Catholic officials, of whom he could be very critical in private.|$|E

25|$|Competitive mode enables players, {{segregated}} in both {{region and}} platform, {{to participate in}} ranked play. Competitive mode is run in seasons that last for three months each with a short break (on {{the order of a}} week to two weeks) between each season to allow Blizzard to make necessary changes to this format; an exception was made for the first season which ran for 1.5 months to align timing for future seasons as to fall on calendar seasons. Players must have reached level 25 from casual matches to partake in competitive play. Before they can play any ranked matches for that season, they must play through ten preliminary matches which assigns a skill rating, which is partially influenced by the player's previous skill ranking on the last season. This ranking is subsequently used for matchmaking purposes in future competitive games they play that season. The player's skill level can move up or down during a season, influenced by their performance and by winning matches against higher-ranked players or losing matches to lower-ranked ones. <b>Specific</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> the skill system over the seasons are described below.|$|E
25|$|Although the Tatars are barbarians from China, {{they are}} {{connected}} to ideas within the Judaeo Christian tradition, including the idea of Original Sin and Eden. The account of Cublai Can in Purchas's work, discussed in Coleridge's Preface, connects the idea of paradise with luxury and sensual pleasure. The place was described in negative terms and seen as an inferior representation of paradise, and Coleridge's ethical system did not connect pleasure with joy or the divine. As for <b>specific</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> the scene, the river and cavern images are used to describe how creativity operates in a post-Edenic reality. The river, Alph, replaces the one from Eden that granted immortality and it disappears into a sunless sea that lacks life. The image is further connected to the Biblical, post-Edenic stories in that a mythological story attributes the violent children of Ham becoming the Tatars, and that Tartarus, derived from the location, became a synonym for hell. Coleridge believed that the Tatars were violent, and that their culture was opposite to the civilised Chinese. The Tatars were also {{in contrast to the}} concept of Prester John, who may have been Prester Chan and, in Ludolphus's account, chased out of Asia by the Tatars and, in John Herbert's Travels, was Abyssinian.|$|E
25|$|Several analogs {{of human}} insulin are available. These insulin analogs {{are closely related}} to the human insulin structure, and were {{developed}} for <b>specific</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> glycemic control in terms of fast action (prandial insulins) and long action (basal insulins). The first biosynthetic insulin analog was developed for clinical use at mealtime (prandial insulin), Humalog (insulin lispro), it is more rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous injection than regular insulin, with an effect 15minutes after injection. Other rapid-acting analogues are NovoRapid and Apidra, with similar profiles. All are rapidly absorbed due to amino acid sequences that will reduce formation of dimers and hexamers (monomeric insulins are more rapidly absorbed). Fast acting insulins do not require the injection-to-meal interval previously recommended for human insulin and animal insulins. The other type is long acting insulin; the first of these was Lantus (insulin glargine). These have a steady effect for an extended period from 18 to 24hours. Likewise, another protracted insulin analogue (Levemir) is based on a fatty acid acylation approach. A myristyric acid molecule is attached to this analogue, which associates the insulin molecule to the abundant serum albumin, which in turn extends the effect and reduces the risk of hypoglycemia. Both protracted analogues need to be taken only once daily, and are used for type 1 diabetics as the basal insulin. A combination of a rapid acting and a protracted insulin is also available, making it more likely for patients to achieve an insulin profile that mimics that of the bodyÂ´s own insulin release.|$|E
