5000|$|Many counties, {{especially}} {{flat and}} low-lying ones, {{have not been}} fully surveyed and thus have no single defined highest point, just multiple areas with the same highest contour line. In order to claim to have successfully climbed the county's highest point, then, {{it is necessary to}} visit all those areas, unless one can clearly be ruled out by line of sight from another one or by virtue of having been graded or excavated. Even if one area has an elevation indicated on the USGS map, the county highpointer must visit other areas within the same contour until and unless the maximum elevations are resolved by an official survey. For flat counties with multiple points, county highpointing is more akin to geocaching than peak bagging, since logically only one of the points is the highpoint, and the rest are not. In this case the number of virtual 'caches' is largely an artifact {{of the size of the}} contour interval (for a given area, the larger the contour interval, the more 'possible' highpoints there will be). For instance suppose the two highest points in a county are 101 feet and 106 feet above sea level, and that neither has a <b>spot</b> <b>elevation</b> on the map. If the region is mapped with 5-foot contours, there will be only 1 [...] "highpoint". However, if the region is mapped with 10-foot contours, there will be two [...] "highpoints", and county highpointers will be required to visit both points to claim the county.|$|E
30|$|Much prior {{research}} on {{learning to use}} topographic maps has focused on trying to facilitate comprehension of the topography by providing the user with additional visual information on the map, such as with shaded relief (e.g., Phillips, Lucia, & Skelton, 1975; Potash, Farrell, & Jeffrey, 1978; Rapp et al., 2007). A critical finding from this work is {{that the benefits of}} additional visual information are limited to reasoning about specific kinds of topographic map problems (e.g., shaded relief shows a moderate improvement over contour lines for landscape visualization tasks, but decreases accuracy for <b>spot</b> <b>elevation</b> problems; Potash et al., 1978). Furthermore, although visual enhancements have been found to help students understand other kinds of contour diagrams (Taylor et al., 2004), the effects of additional visual information during learning on students’ skills for topographic map use later on is still unknown.|$|E

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that caves in the Florida Peninsula {{are tied to}} Quaternary sea levels was proposed by hydrogeologists, without data, some 40 years ago. The hypothesis is a version of glacial control of cave levels, which is the logical combination of the water-table theory of speleogenesis and the concept that base level positions the water table. At the USA type example of glacial control of cave levels—Mammoth Cave in the Paleozoic rocks of Kentucky—the intermediary is base level determined by rivers. By hypothesis, the intermediary for Florida is glacioeustatic sea level. This paper presents elevation data that supports this hypothesis. Recent cave surveys in the air-filled caves and <b>spot</b> <b>elevations</b> from archived maps reveal prominent levels of passages centered at 5, 12, 21, and 30 m above sea level over broad areas. They do not follow the large-scale structure of the Floridan aquifer. Instead, they align with nearby, coastal marine terraces identified as modal peaks on frequency plots from various topographic data bases. Levels matching with the three highest terraces—Wicomico, Penholoway, and Talbott—are particularly clear. Lower levels, if they accord with sea-level stands, are likely composites. Data from cavities encountered in drilled wells (e. g., bit drops) and <b>spot</b> <b>elevations</b> from archived underwater cave maps demonstrate passage levels at depths of 15, 30, 70, and 90 – 120 m below the modern water table. The depths below water table {{are similar to the}} depths below sea level of distant submerged terraces and paleoshoreline features identified using multibeam bathymetric data in the Gulf of Mexico. The cave, bit-drop, and terrace data are all consistent with the concept that Quaternary sea level is the fundamental control on the cave-scale porosity within the Floridan aquifer. This conclusion does not {{rule out the possibility that}} lithologically favored positions, paleokarst features and confining units, and mixing zones are also involved in the location of caves levels in this near-coastal environment...|$|R

Apatites separated from rock samples collected from known elevations at various locations north and south of Byrd Glacier were dated using single crystal (U–Th) /He analysis. Results indicate a denudation rate of c. 0. 04 mm a 21 in the time range c. 140 – 40 Ma. Distinct age v. elevation plots from north and south of Byrd Glacier indicate an offset of c. 1 km across the glacier with south side up.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyze the River Watershed Coisa Boa in the region of Igatu, Chapada Diamantina-Ba, from morphometric analysis: hierarchical, linear, areal and hypsometric its {{drainage}} network. The parameters analyzed were the order of channels, numbers and length of channels of each order, bifurcation ratio, length of main channel (Lm), basin area (A); basin perimeter (P) form factor (F); compactness coefficient (Kc), the basin length (L) shape of the basin (Ic), density of rivers (Dr), drainage density (Dd), minimum altitude of the basin, maximum altitude of the basin, maximum amplitude of the altimetry basin relief ratio, roughness index. These indices were chosen since they allow a greater relationship between the characteristics of rock, soil and topography, with the drainage network.

40|$|Active {{remote sensing}} technologies, {{including}} interferometric radar (InSAR) and airborne laser scanning (LIDAR) {{have the potential}} to provide accurate information relating to three-dimensional forest canopy structure over extensive areas of the landscape. In order to assess the capabilities of these alternative systems for characterizing the forest canopy dimensions, canopy- and terrain-level elevation models derived from multi-frequency InSAR and high-density LIDAR data were compared to photogrammetric forest canopy measurements acquired within a Douglas-fir forest near Olympia, WA. Canopy and terrain surface elevations were measured on large scale photographs along two representative profiles within this forest area, and these elevations were compared to corresponding elevations extracted from canopy models generated from X-band InSAR and high-density LIDAR data. In addition, the elevations derived from InSAR and LIDAR canopy models were compared to photogrammetric canopy elevations acquired at distinct <b>spot</b> <b>elevations</b> throughout the study area. Results generally indicate that both technologies can provide valuable measurements of gross canopy dimensions. In general, LIDAR elevation models acquired from high-density data more accurately represent the complex morphology of the canopy surface, while InSAR models provide a generalized, less-detailed characterization of canopy structure. The biases observed in the InSAR and LIDAR canopy surface models relative to the photogrammetric measurements are likely due to the different physical processes and geometric principles underlying elevation measurement wit...|$|R
40|$|The Tolay Creek Watershed drains {{approximately}} 3, 520 ha {{along the}} northern edge of San Francisco Bay. Surrounded by a mosaic of open space conservation easements and public wildlife areas, {{it is one of the}} only watersheds in this urbanized estuary that is protected from its headwaters to the bay. Tolay Lake is a seasonal, spring-fed lake found in the upper watershed that historically extended over 120 ha. Although the lakebed was farmed since the early 1860 s, the majority of the lakebed was recently acquired by the Sonoma County Regional Parks Department to restore its natural habitat values. As part of the restoration planning process, we produced a digital elevation model (DEM) of the historic extent of Tolay Lake by integrating terrestrial LiDAR (light detection and ranging) and stereo photogrammetry datasets, and real-time kinematic (RTK) global positioning system (GPS) surveys. We integrated the data, generated a DEM of the lakebed and upland areas, and analyzed errors. The accuracy of the composite DEM was verified using <b>spot</b> <b>elevations</b> obtained from the RTK GPS.
