40|$|Credit default swaps (CDSs) are {{derivative}} {{contracts that}} allow agents {{to shift the}} risk of default on an underlying credit from a credit protection buyer to a credit protection seller. Like other derivatives they are standardised relative to the underlying cash markets {{and in this way}} can help promote market liquidity. This in turn can facilitate risk shifting and price discovery. In this way they may lead to accurate pricing of credit risk and ultimately to the reduced costs of borrowing. However, like other derivatives it is possible that CDS contracts could play a part in market manipulations, especially when the underlying cash market is not transparent. This is a potential cost of CDS trading that should be weighed against potential benefi ts of liquidity, risk shifting and price discovery. We discuss the balance of these trade-offs in the context of singlename corporate CDSs, index CDSs, sovereign CDSs and CDSs on <b>structured</b> <b>credit</b> <b>product</b> tranches. We also discuss other potential costs of CDS trading including that they “make selling short too cheap ” and that they may create market instability by facilitating speculative attacks...|$|E

This paper matches the traded values of <b>structured</b> <b>credit</b> <b>products</b> by modelling the defaults of the underlying credits and their interdependence. It offers an improvement on the industry-standard ‘Gaussian copula’ model in its ability to capture the ‘tail event’ of multiple firms defaulting together.

40|$|Abstract. The {{evaluation}} of <b>structured</b> <b>credit</b> <b>products</b> like baskets and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) most often {{relies on the}} simulation of correlated default times for the underlying pool of credit instruments. Given the distribution of a default time vector one can find {{the distribution of the}} corresponding (cumulative) default quote path for a portfolio. In this note we show that the multivariate dependence of marginal default quote distributions over time can be based on a comonotonic structure without loosing information regarding default timing. Based on comonotonicity, default quote paths and random variables arising from basket evaluation like the time until the n-th default can be simulated very efficiently. 1 Introduction an...|$|R

40|$|Credit rating {{agencies}} have attracted renewed attention following the sharp downgrades of <b>structured</b> <b>credit</b> <b>products</b> {{in the wake}} of the US subprime mortgage crisis and those that recently accompanied the weakening in some sovereign balance sheets. For the most part, this attention reflects the myriad ways in which ratings are hardwired into the financial system, a theme that will be discussed below. Before getting to that, however, it is important to understand what credit ratings are and what they are not. First, it should be acknowledged that ratings serve useful purposes. They aggregate information about borrowers, thus facilitating access to funding, and adding liquidity to markets that would otherwise be illiquid. For example, ratings were a key driver in the development of <b>structured</b> <b>credit</b> markets. And ratings have proven to be fairly accurate measures of relative corporate and sovereign creditworthiness.

40|$|The {{current crisis}} {{is the worst}} to hit mature {{financial}} markets in decades, {{and it is not}} yet over. In the run-up to the crisis, low nominal interest rates, ample liquidity, low financial market volatility, and a general feeling of complacency had encouraged many types of investors to take on more risk. The lengthy period of benign financial market conditions was expected to continue, global growth had been robust, and the previous excesses of the dot-com bubble seemed in the distant past. In short, many believed in a new paradigm for financial markets. Hence, investment in riskier assets and strategies became the norm, often with little understanding of the underlying risks and insufficient capital to support them. Despite repeated warnings from the official sector that financial stability could be compromised by the intense “search for yield, ” private sector incentives continued to encourage further risk taking. By the spring of 2007, even top managers in some of the largest financial institutions began to express public concern, particularly about <b>structured</b> <b>credit</b> securities backed by subprime mortgages and the leniency of the loan covenants and conditions backing leveraged buyout activity. But, given still-low interest rates and ample liquidity, demand for <b>structured</b> <b>credit</b> <b>products</b> carrying the AAA rating and earning higher-than-normal yields continued unimpeded until mid- 2007 (see Chart 1). Supervisors had insufficient information and clout to halt the proliferation of overpriced securities. Thus, competitive pressures to issue and sell these types of products were so intense that—as Charles Prince, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Citigroup, told a reporter in early July that year—top management felt that “as long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance. ” As in many previous credit crises, it was the loosening of credit standards during the lending frenzy that caused the initial set of losses. Although the event was triggered by rising U. S. mortgage loan delinquencies—particularly in the subprime market—the knock-on effects have been particularly severe.

40|$|The {{credit market}} turmoil since mid- 2007 has {{substantially}} affected {{the terms and}} conditions of funding in leveraged finance markets. Rising investor risk aversion, growing pressure on bank balance sheets {{and a loss of}} confidence in <b>structured</b> <b>credit</b> <b>products</b> have sharply reduced demand for leveraged loans. The materialisation of warehouse risks from failed leveraged loan syndications contributed to unwanted expansion of bank balance sheets and has affected credit supply. The knock-on effects from deteriorating conditions in leveraged loan markets have also affected private equity financing. Against the background of these developments, the working group report on private equity and leveraged finance markets under the chairmanship of Henk Brouwer of the Netherlands Bank addresses two broad questions. First, what have been the important trends during the period of rapid growth in the markets for leveraged finance, private equity and leveraged buyouts, and how has market growth affected incentives and corporate structures? Second, how have leveraged finance markets performed since mid- 2007, which risks have surfaced, and what preliminary lessons can be drawn for financial stability?. ...|$|R
40|$|Characterizing the {{dependence}} in credit spreads and default intensities across companies {{is a central}} problem in credit risk. Existing practice typically relies on factor models or simple static Gaussian copula models. We instead use genuinely dynamic copula models which can capture univariate and multivariate non-normalities and asymmetries for large cross-sections of firms. Using weekly data for over nine years on 223 firms, we find that {{the dependence}} in default intensities and CDS spreads is highly time-varying and persistent, and it increases significantly in the financial crisis. The dependence between equity returns also increases in the financial crisis, but this increase is much less persistent. We document substantial multivariate non-normalities for CDS spreads and default intensities, but multivariate asymmetries are less important for credit than they are for equities. The increase in cross-sectional dependence during the financial crisis has substantially reduced diversification benefits from selling credit protection, and it is critical to take non-normality into account when computing these benefits. These findings have important implications for the management of portfolio credit risk, the pricing of <b>structured</b> <b>credit</b> <b>products,</b> and the role of credit-risky securities in diversified portfolios.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{analysis}} is {{to determine whether the}} rating criteria used by the credit rating agencies is consistent for African-based reinsurers and non-African companies. A credit rating is an assessment of a large variety of information that needs to be known about the creditworthiness of the issuer or provider of financial instruments. The credit rating agencies thus contribute to solving principal-agent problems by assisting lenders in piercing the fog of asymmetric information that surrounds lending relationships and help borrowers emerge from that same fog (Fong, Hong, Kacperczyk, & Kubik, 2014). Credit rating agencies have been criticised for their role in the financial crisis of 2008 as they underestimated the credit risk associated with <b>structured</b> <b>credit</b> <b>products.</b> Yet, the financial crisis for emerging markets is a perennial one that they seemingly cannot recover from. Whilst the subject of poorly-rated reinsurance security is endemic to the emerging market, negligible research has been conducted to understand the problem or quantify its impact upon the reinsurance industry. This report is the first to focus on this specific problem in Africa and has managed to highlight arguments and themes that warrant further research and investigation in order to gain a deeper, more comprehensive understanding of the factors differentiating the African reinsurance sector and negatively impacting their competitiveness in their own market.

40|$|Motivated by {{the global}} {{financial}} market turbulence in 2007 - 2011 and the gaps from the literature, this thesis presents an econometric assessment of different transmission mechanisms that propagated and amplified shocks from advanced economies to East Asia. The asset price channel is investigated with MS-VAR model and multivariate unconditional correlation tests. The recursive bivariate probit models are applied to test the liquidity shock transmission via the sudden stop in international lending. The second round effects are examined with partial adjustment models and system GMM estimation. The econometric procedure and testing approach bring about novel results from superior estimation techniques and handle several statistical problems such as heteroskedasticity, non-linearity, endogeneity, omitted variables, simultaneous equations and sample selection bias. The main finding of the thesis is that despite relatively sound fundamentals and limited exposure to <b>structured</b> <b>credit</b> <b>products,</b> East Asia could not totally decouple from the global financial crisis. Specifically, the asset price channels propagated volatility spillovers from the US and Europe to East Asian equity, foreign exchange and CDS markets. While international volatility spillovers were mainly caused by fundamental links, international behaviour during the shocks intensified the regional linkages and generated contagion effect. There was also contagion evidence associated with the sudden stop in international lending which facilitated the transmission of liquidity tensions in the interbank markets. Finally, contagion was magnified by the second round effects, defined as the feedback loops from the sudden changes in macro-financial conditions which caused adverse adjustment in bank performance. These findings have useful implications for international investors and policy authorities regarding to portfolio diversification and systematic risk containment. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{light of}} the {{uncertainties}} about valuation highlighted by the 2007 – 08 market turbulence, this chapter provides an empirical examination of the potential procyclicality that fair value accounting (FVA) methods could introduce in bank balance sheets. The chapter finds that, while weaknesses in the FVA methodology may introduce unintended volatility and procyclicality, thus requiring some enhancements, {{it is still the}} preferred accounting framework for financial institutions. It concludes that capital buffers, forward-looking provisioning, and more refined disclosures can help to mitigate the procyclicality of FVA. The analysis presented does not preclude that there are other dimensions to FVA that are relevant and that, after further scrutiny, may indicate the need for additional refinements to the FVA methodology. Going forward, the valuation approaches for accounting, prudential measures, and risk management need to be reconciled and will require adjustments on the part of all parties. Since the 2007 market turmoil surrounding complex <b>structured</b> <b>credit</b> <b>products,</b> fair value accounting (FVA) and its application through the business cycle has been a topic of considerable debate. As the illiquidity of certain products became more severe, financial institutions turned increasingly to model-based valuations that, despite increased disclosure requirements, were nevertheless accompanied by growing opacity in the classification of products across the fair value (FV) spectrum. Moreover, under stressed liquidity conditions, financial institutions made wider use of unobservable inputs in their valuations, increasing uncertainty among financial institutions, supervisors, and investors regarding the valuation of financial products under such conditions. It has been during this period that the procyclical impact of FVA on bank balance sheets Note: This chapter was written by a team led b...|$|R
40|$|The {{credit markets}} {{experienced}} fundamental changes {{during the last}} two decades. Corporate debt volumes have expanded rapidly making such debt one of the largest asset classes in financial markets. <b>Structured</b> <b>credit</b> <b>products</b> revolutionized banking practices and transformed the framework of credit risk management. Credit risk modeling, valuation and rating have, in consequence, been extensively studied. Many issues remain controversial for both academics and industry practitioners, however, especially {{in the wake of the}} recent financial crisis. This thesis contributes to the existing literature in four ways. First, a new approach is introduced for jointly estimating rating-specific bond spread term structures. The approach achieves fitting accuracy comparable to the more standard extended Nelson-Siegel technique meanwhile yielding well-behaved and stable term structures which are appropriately ordered for different rating classes. Second, a ‘clinical’ study is presented of the evolution of Asset Backed Security (ABS) valuations conditional on ratings during two crisis periods, namely the 2007 - 2009 crisis and the earlier collapse of ABS secured against Manufactured Housing loans of 2002 - 2003. The study focusses on the market’s reactions to different pricing factors in crisis time including liquidity and risk premiums. Third, we examine predictable fluctuations in agency ratings behavior over the business cycle and propose simple, tractable ways of parameterizing time-varying rating transition matrices. Fourth, we examine the dependence of corporate bond market risk premiums on industrial sector. The analysis sheds light on the hypothesis that the cross-sectional pattern of risk premiums reflects the degree to which bond issuers operate in cyclically sensitive industries. By adjusting sectorspecific spreads for time-varying and sector specific expected losses and for liquidity, we show that spreads and, even more so, risk premiums are related to the cyclicality of the obligor’s industry.

The credit crunch crisis in the financial markets has illustrated once more the need for more refined models. The readers will learn how the classical models (driven by Brownian motions, cfr. Black-Scholes settings) can be improved by considering the more flexible class of Lévy processes. By doing this, extreme event and jumps are introduced in the models leading to a more realistic assessment of the risk presents.

40|$|The latest {{episode of}} {{turbulence}} {{has been marked}} by an extended period of illiquidity in a large number of markets –ranging from traditionally highly liquid interbank money markets to the less-liquid <b>structured</b> <b>credit</b> markets. The event began with what was widely perceived as a credit deterioration in the US subprime mortgage market. However, this quickly raised uncertainty about the valuation of securities related to this market, thus affecting their liquidity. The rapidity with which this market illiquidity has been transmitted into funding illiquidity has been both striking and unprecedented. The event has raised questions about how market liquidity in a variety of instruments is determined in both primary and secondary markets and how mechanisms act to transmit illiquidity across markets during a period of stress. The article seeks to identify how standard concepts of liquidity can be applied to various types of markets across the globe with a view to interpreting how liquidity deteriorated so quickly. Several attributes of liquidity –types of market structures (including existence of formal intermediaries and trading venues), the construction of the instruments, and the types of investors– are used to guide the analysis. One feature that appears to be important for liquidity {{is the degree to which}} information about the risks underlying the financial instrument are well understood by both buyers and sellers. Another insight is that the expectations of market participants about liquidity and their ability to monitor it also have an impact on liquidity itself. These attributes suggest that the growth in securitization and complex <b>structured</b> <b>credit</b> <b>products</b> –new developments in the transfer of credit risk– may carry with them a predilection to adverse liquidity events that will require further examination. In light of the analysis, the article identifies ways of mitigating some of the problems that arose in this latest bout of illiquidity. Because liquidity is created and maintained by the market participants themselves, most of the room for improvement rests with the private sector. It is already clear that some market practices and policies will need to change and in this context some suggestions for enhancements to financial institutions’ liquidity risk management are outlined. However, given that both market and funding liquidity are intimately related to financial stability, a public good, there is also a potential role for the public sector. Hence, the tools used by central banks to maintain their role in effi cient monetary policy transmission together with financial stability will need to be reviewed. ...|$|R
40|$|Critics of fringe banking—{{products}} like payday loans, pawn loans, and rent-toown leases—frequently {{argue that}} these products cause borrowers to experience financial distress. This argument has enormous intuitive appeal: Fringe credit is very costly, and usually the borrowers who use it are already in a serious financial bind.

40|$|In the {{traditional}} model of financial intermediation, the sources {{and the process}} of liquidity creation through banks’ balance sheets were particularly clear. The robustness of liquidity in such a regime is essentially based {{on the quality of the}} banks’ assets and the credibility offered by the institutional framework within which they operate (deposit insurance, access to central bank money and more generally regulatory and prudential constraints). In the current financial system, with the perpetual supply of new capital and risk transfer instruments, endogenous liquidity sources have undeniably diversified and grown, but they appear to be less stable and reliable. Financial innovation, to an extent, may have let market participants believe that they could, on an enduring basis, escape from the monetary constraint (the need for genuine cash) and that they could make do with the liabilities issued by other institutions to meet their liquidity needs. However, market instruments can satisfy investors’ liquidity preference only as long as the state of confidence in the marketplace supports them. Liquidity preference, which is intimately linked to asset price expectations, is indeed liable to shift swiftly at times, and to bring about runs on the most certain forms of liquidity (bank money, and worse, central bank money). Ultimately, the liquidity of fi nancial assets depends on the trust that they can be redeemed on demand. Such trust is probably more difficult to ascertain in the market-based, highly securitised world. Still, crises may sometimes have educational virtues, and the turmoil of this summer has revealed some urgent needs to “robustify” the sources of liquidity in the system. It is now obvious that some additional suppliers of liquidity are needed in nearly absent secondary markets for complex <b>structured</b> <b>credit</b> <b>products.</b> This probably cannot be achieved without greater disclosure on the structures of investments among market participants. It is also clear that the containment of liquidity risk depends on the ability of fi nancial institutions to properly price complex products, in their regular risk management process as well as in times of crisis. The “liquidity frontier” cannot be pushed back indefi nitely. Those who, in the end, accept illiquidity in their balance sheet must clearly understand and control the risks they are taking on. Such illiquidity is more acceptable for investors with long time horizons, and who are not subject to creditors suddenly calling in their money at short notice. For others, larger liquidity buffers acting as an automatic stabiliser to smooth the financial cycle might be necessary to hedge their risk. Without such precautions, financial innovation could unduly extend the liquidity insurance implicitly expected of central banks. Yet, it is certainly not the role of a central bank to prompt market participants to rush into “not-so-reliable liabilities”. ...|$|R
