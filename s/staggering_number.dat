Wolves and other hunting animals were {{themselves}} being hunted into extinction. In 1911, 55 gray wolves were killed in the South Dakota Black Hills, with bounties paid. In 1915, 8 more were killed; in 1916, 5 more. A pregnant wolf and her four pups were killed in 1917, and what was possibly her mate was killed in 1920. Without the buffalo and other game to prey on, wolves had to adapt to changing circumstances; they did so by attacking livestock. Many wolves were simply poisoned with strychnine; others were shot in a large federally funded eradication program, which between 1915 and 1920 employed over 300 hunters, who killed a <b>staggering</b> <b>number</b> of animals: 110,000 coyotes, 15,000 bobcats and lynxes, 3,000 wolves.

Because of this, there are many words and phrases common to most spam e-mails that do not occur in desirable e-mail messages. A naïve Bayesian classifier can be employed to detect these spam messages, but the computing costs associated with classifying a large number of messages can be very high. To resolve this problem, two modifications are made to the classifier. The computation is simplified using unique classifiers for each message. In addition, the vocabulary used by the classifiers is reduced using an entropy-based technique. These modifications reduce the cost of the classification and reduce the error rate of the classifier. ...|$|R
