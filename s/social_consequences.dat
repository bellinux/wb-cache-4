5|$|In 1981, Dworkin {{published}} , which analyzes (and extensively cites examples drawn from) {{contemporary and}} historical pornography {{as an industry}} of woman-hating dehumanization. Dworkin argues that it is implicated in violence against women, both in its production (through the abuse of the women used to star in it), and in the <b>social</b> <b>consequences</b> of its consumption by encouraging men to eroticize the domination, humiliation, and abuse of women.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} Jens Wehner {{notes that}} the German-language version of the book was immensely popular in Germany, but contained serious flaws in terms of presentation of historical realities. These included the uncritical borrowing from the Nazi propaganda elements of the Fliegerasse ("aces") and stereotypes about the Soviet Union. According to Wehner, the latter could {{be traced to the}} prevailing attitudes during the Cold War. Further, the political and <b>social</b> <b>consequences</b> of World War II were completely ignored.|$|E

5|$|As with A Wizard of Earthsea, The Tombs of Atuan is a bildungsroman or coming-of-age story, {{this time}} from the {{perspective}} of a female character, Tenar. Though she nominally has a position of high authority, Tenar feels trapped by her duties as priestess, and desires to escape to a place where she can make her own choices. In contrast to Ged, whose journey was chiefly a private quest, Tenar's choices have direct <b>social</b> <b>consequences.</b> While Ged's growth is traced through the various adventures he experiences in the first volume of the series, Tenar's development is shown through her exploration of her own domain. The labyrinth, in particular, with its twists and turns, is a metaphor for Tenar's exploration of her own thoughts. In this reading of the novel, the labyrinth symbolizes the imprisonment of the women, and the darkness and unacknowledged thoughts within Tenar, which she begins to struggle through after feeling guilt over killing the prisoners sent to her.|$|E
5|$|In February 1793 {{the newly}} formed French Republic {{declared}} war on Great Britain, extending the French Revolutionary Wars that had begun the year before on the continent. The French Navy {{was in a state}} of upheaval due to the <b>social</b> <b>consequences</b> of the French Revolution, and as a result found itself at a disadvantage to the Royal Navy, which had been preparing for war since June 1792. In response, the French sent several frigate squadrons to sea, including their newest ships and best sailors and officers in an attempt to disrupt British commerce in the early stages of the war. One such squadron was sent in April 1793 to the United States, carrying the French ambassador to the United States, Edmond-Charles Genêt. After the ambassador disembarked, the squadron, under the command of Captain Jean-Baptiste-François Bompart, dispersed to raid British shipping along the coast, capturing or destroying more than 60 merchant vessels before retiring to American ports for repairs.|$|E
5|$|The wider {{political}} environment in Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries was also volatile. For centuries {{the relationship with}} the Confederation's powerful neighbour, France, determined the foreign policies of the Swiss. Nominally, the Confederation formed a part of the Holy Roman Empire. However, through a succession of wars culminating in the Swabian War in 1499, the Confederation had become de facto independent. As the two continental powers and minor regional states such as the Duchy of Milan, the Duchy of Savoy, and the Papal States competed and fought against each other, there were far-reaching political, economic, and <b>social</b> <b>consequences</b> for the Confederation. During this time the mercenary pension system became a subject of disagreement. The religious factions of Zwingli's time debated vociferously the merits of sending young Swiss men to fight in foreign wars mainly for the enrichment of the cantonal authorities.|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{definitions}} of risk partition concern into {{the probability of}} occurrence and the consequence of the event. Most safety analyses focus on probabilistic assessment of an occurrence {{and the amount of}} some measurable result of the event, but the real meaning of the ``consequence`` partition is usually afforded less attention. In particular, acceptable <b>social</b> <b>consequence</b> (consequence accepted by the public) frequently differs significantly from the metrics commonly proposed by risk analysts. This paper addresses some of the important system development issues associated with consequences, focusing on ``high consequence operations safety. `...|$|R

50|$|In England, {{degeneration}} {{received a}} scientific formulation from Ray Lankester whose detailed {{discussions of the}} biology of parasitism were hugely influential; and the poor physical condition of many recruits for the second South African war (1899-1902) caused alarm in British government circles. The psychiatrist Henry Maudsley initially argued that degenerate family lines would die out with little <b>social</b> <b>consequence,</b> but later became more pessimistic {{about the effects of}} degeneration on the British population.|$|R

5000|$|The {{most common}} <b>social</b> <b>consequence</b> {{for victims of}} sexual {{violence}} is isolation from their families and communities.

25|$|What {{constitutes}} {{an act of}} infidelity depends upon the exclusivity expectations within the relationship. In marital relationships, exclusivity expectations are commonly assumed although they are not always met. When they are not met, {{research has found that}} psychological damage can occur, including feelings of rage and betrayal, lowering of sexual and personal confidence, and damage to self-image. Depending on the context, men and women can experience <b>social</b> <b>consequences</b> if their act of infidelity becomes public. The form and extent of these consequences are often dependent on the gender of the unfaithful person.|$|E
25|$|Children {{born out}} of {{adultery}} suffered, until recently, adverse legal and <b>social</b> <b>consequences.</b> In France, for instance, a law that stated that the inheritance rights of a child born under such circumstances were, {{on the part of}} the married parent, half of what they would have been under ordinary circumstances, remained in force until 2001, when France was forced to change it by a ruling of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) (and in 2013, the ECtHR also ruled that the new 2001 regulations must be also applied to children born before 2001).|$|E

50|$|In advertising, a fear {{pattern is}} a {{sequence}} of fear arousal and fear reduction that is felt by the viewing audience when exposed to an advertisement which attempts to threaten the audience by presenting a negative physical, psychological or <b>social</b> <b>consequence</b> {{that is likely to}} occur if they engage in a particular behaviour. Fear appeals are commonly used in social marketing campaigns. These are sometimes called “threat appeals”, however the label “fear appeals” is justified if the appeal can be shown to arouse fear.|$|R

25|$|Disruption in self-identity, {{relationships}} with others, and emotional well-being {{can lead to}} <b>social</b> <b>consequences</b> after stroke {{due to the lack}} of ability to communicate. Many people who experience communication impairments after a stroke find it more difficult to cope with the social issues rather than physical impairments. Broader aspects of care must address the emotional impact speech impairment has on those who experience difficulties with speech after a stroke. Those who experience a stroke are at risk of paralysis which could result in a self disturbed body image which may also lead to other social issues.|$|E
25|$|In {{a similar}} vein, {{some have argued}} that the unique metacognitive {{capabilities}} demonstrated by humans have arisen out of the development of a sophisticated language (symbolization) systems and culture. Moreover, in a developmental context, it has been proposed that each executive function capability originated as a form of public behaviour directed at the external environment, but then became self-directed, and then finally, became private to the individual, {{over the course of the}} development of self-regulation. These shifts in function illustrate the evolutionarily salient strategy of maximizing longer-term <b>social</b> <b>consequences</b> over near-term ones, through the development of an internal control of behaviour.|$|E
25|$|Men were {{introduced}} into the field of obstetrics {{in the nineteenth century}} and resulted in a change of the focus of this profession. Gynaecology directly resulted as a new and separate field of study from obstetrics and focused on the curing of illness and indispositions of female sexual organs. This had some relevance to some conditions as menopause, uterine and cervical problems, and childbirth could leave the mother in need of extensive surgery to repair tissue. But, there was also a large blame of the uterus for completely unrelated conditions. This led to many <b>social</b> <b>consequences</b> of the nineteenth century.|$|E
