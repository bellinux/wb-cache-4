5|$|Two ex-Roman Catholic priests, Victor Legendre and Charles-Yvan Giroux {{converted}} to Raëlianism. A former bishop of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) joined the Raelian Movement <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> openly gay. The Raëlian, Mark Woodgate, stated that 8% of Raëlians worldwide are former Latter-day Saints. Religiously mixed couples are common, especially with spouses who are Christians or Buddhists.|$|E

5|$|Headley {{was born}} in Colón, Panama on 30 May 1909, the son of DeCourcy Headley and Irene Roberts. Neither of Headley's parents was from Panama; his father was from Barbados and his mother from Jamaica, but they had moved to Panama while DeCourcey worked on the {{construction}} of the Panama Canal. By the time Headley was five years old the Canal was complete, and the family moved to Cuba in search of further employment. In 1919, concerned by the amount of Spanish being spoken by her son, Headley's mother took him to Jamaica <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> educated in an English-speaking school.|$|E
5|$|Hillcourt was tasked {{to write}} a new manual for Scoutmasters in 1934 and worked with his good friend and {{colleague}} E. Urner Goodman, the national program director of the BSA. He and his wife moved to a house in Mendham Borough, New Jersey, to be near Schiff Scout Reservation, the BSA's national training center, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> in place to put this theories to a practical test. In order to do so, he founded Troop 1 of Mendham in 1935 as a unit directly chartered to the National Council of the BSA. As the Scoutmaster, he used Troop 1 to test and validate his work for 16years.|$|E
5|$|Latin sources {{add that}} Oenopion {{was the son}} of Dionysus. Dionysus sent satyrs to put Orion into a deep sleep <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> blinded. One source tells the same story but {{converts}} Oenopion into Minos of Crete. It adds that an oracle told Orion that his sight could be restored by walking eastward and that he found his way by hearing the Cyclops' hammer, placing a Cyclops as a guide on his shoulder; it does not mention Cabeiri or Lemnos—this is presumably the story of Cedalion recast. Both Hephaestus and the Cyclopes were said to make thunderbolts; they are combined in other sources. One scholion, on a Latin poem, explains that Hephaestus gave Orion a horse.|$|E

5|$|The raid was {{preceded by}} the escape of seven POWs on 30 August 1944. The organisers of the escape were Private Ralph Frederick Churches, an Australian Army {{infantry}} soldier of the 2/48th Battalion {{who had been on}} temporary duty with Headquarters ANZAC Corps when he was captured during the Allied withdrawal from Greece in April–May 1941, and Driver Leslie Arthur Laws, a British Army soldier of the 127th (Dorset) Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, Royal Engineers. By August 1944, Churches had already attempted to escape on two occasions and had learned about the surroundings from those experiences. He realised that he had to escape while the prisoners were in an environment hostile to the Germans. Churches had learned to speak passable German during his captivity, and had been the camp leader of the work camp for eighteen months when he resigned the role <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> involved in the escape.|$|E
5|$|When Rasputin {{was murdered}} in December 1916, Victoria and Kirill signed a letter along with other {{relatives}} asking the Tsar to show leniency to Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia, one of those implicated in the murder. The Tsar denied their request. Twice during the war Victoria visited Romania, where her sister Marie was now queen, volunteering aid for war victims. Victoria returned to Saint Petersburg in February 1917. Kirill had been appointed commander of the Naval Guards, quartered in Saint Petersburg, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> with his family for some time. Although publicly loyal to the Tsar, Victoria and Kirill began to meet in private with other relatives to discuss {{the best way to}} save the monarchy.|$|E
5|$|Compton and Evans {{continued}} {{to resist the}} Australians on the final morning, the latter being the more aggressive, and proceedings were briefly interrupted by rain less than 30 minutes {{after the start of}} play. At the time, it appeared the downpour might cause the match to end in a draw. After half an hour of stoppages, play resumed and Evans attacked, hitting two fours in quick succession. England's wicket-keeper played Johnston and Johnson confidently, but Bradman nevertheless persisted in giving Compton easy singles in order to bring Evans on strike <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> targeted. For his part, Compton thought his partner could be relied upon and accepted the runs gifted to him by the Australian captain, while Evans {{continued to}} attack the bowling. The batsmen appealed against the light after the first stoppage of the day, but were turned down. Australia took the new ball, but the home team's batsmen continued to proceed steadily, Evans being particularly aggressive. After a second interruption for poor light, this time for ten minutes, play resumed, and England had added a further 60 runs to their overnight total to reach 405/6.|$|E

25|$|Because St. Christopher offered {{protection}} to travelers and against sudden death, many churches placed images or statues of him, usually opposite the south door, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> easily seen.

In England, there are more wall paintings of St. Christopher than of any other saint; in 1904, Mrs. Collier, writing for the British Archaeological Association, reported 183 paintings, statues, and other representations of the saint, outnumbering all others except for the Virgin Mary.|$|E
25|$|Afterwards, the Islanders slowly declined, while {{injuries}} {{took their}} toll on Bossy's back. He was limited to 63 games in the 1986–87 season but still managed to score 38 goals.

During his season off, Bill Torrey had offered Bossy to be traded to the Montreal Canadiens, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> closer to home, but Bossy declined.

He chose fighter training at Williams Air Force Base in Chandler, AZ. The group commander was known to be tough on his students, and Givens chose this location <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> formed into a great fighter pilot.|$|E
25|$|On March 5, 1876, Hickok married Agnes Thatcher Lake, a 50-year-old circus {{proprietor}} in Cheyenne, Wyoming Territory. Hickok {{left his}} new bride {{a few months}} later, joining Charlie Utter's wagon train to seek his fortune in the gold fields of South Dakota. Martha Jane Cannary, known popularly as Calamity Jane, claimed in her autobiography that {{she was married to}} Hickok and had divorced him <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> free to marry Agnes Lake, but no records have been found that support her account. The two possibly {{met for the first time}} after Jane was released from the guardhouse in Fort Laramie and joined the wagon train in which Hickok was traveling. The wagon train arrived in Deadwood in July 1876. Jane confirmed this account in an 1896 newspaper interview, although she claimed she had been hospitalized with illness rather than in the guardhouse.|$|E
