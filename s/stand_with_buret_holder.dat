40|$|Understanding how the {{planting}} of non-native species impacts native vegetation is of most importance for forest management, as introduced species may alter environmental conditions {{with respect to}} soil composition, light intensity, and species composition. Here, we compared the stand structure, understory vegetation and site properties of a natural Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) <b>stand</b> <b>with</b> Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) as the second tree layer. We recorded saplings and species and their abundance in the understory vegetation, the thicknesses of organic (O) and humus (A) soil layers, soil pH and light indexes in nine Scots pine <b>stands</b> <b>with</b> a second tree layer of beech and in nine control pine <b>stands</b> <b>with</b> a second tree layer of spruce. An ordination method was used to analyze all the data together and ANOVA {{to determine whether there}} were differences between stands. We found that species diversity in pine <b>stands</b> <b>with</b> planted beech as the second layer was lower than in pine <b>stands</b> <b>with</b> spruce as the second layer. In pine <b>stands</b> <b>with</b> beech as the second tree layer, shrub, herb and moss cover was significantly lower, and the soil humus layer and organic soil layer were thicker and thinner, respectively. Stand parameters such as mean volume and mean annual increment of the second tree layer were significantly higher in pine <b>stands</b> <b>with</b> planted beech as the second tree layer than in pine <b>stand</b> <b>with</b> spruce as the second tree layer. The mean volume and the mean annual increment of the first tree layer dominated by Scots pine did not differ significantly between <b>stands</b> <b>with</b> planted beech and those with natural spruce. Scots pine <b>stands</b> <b>with</b> a beech second layer had negative effects on understory species richness and abundance. This effect was most likely due to the lower light transmittance and poor physical properties of the forest-floor litter in the Scots pine <b>stands</b> <b>with</b> planted beech...|$|R

40|$|Beech bark {{disease was}} {{discovered}} in Michigan in 2000 and will likely kill at least 50 % of mature American beech trees. Our {{study was designed to}} determine how wildlife resource abundance will be affected as beech bark disease spreads and intensifies throughout Michigan. We assessed the potential impact in forest <b>stands</b> <b>with</b> varying beech densities (low, moderate, and high) and abundance of Cryptococcus fagisuga (absent, light, and heavy). Variables were measured in 62 stands throughout the Upper and Lower Peninsulas of Michigan in 2002 and 2003. Beech snags were significantly more abundant in <b>stands</b> <b>with</b> heavy C. fagisuga abundance than in <b>stands</b> <b>with</b> absent or light C. fagisuga abundance. Coarse woody debris volume and beechnut mass were highest in <b>stands</b> <b>with</b> heavy C. fagisuga abundance, although means were not statistically different...|$|R
