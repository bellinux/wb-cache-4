40|$|The {{agriculture}} {{sector in}} Indonesia {{is experiencing a}} major transition. While the Indonesian population increased from 206 to 237 {{million people in the}} period from 2000 to 2010, the number of <b>smallholders</b> decreased from 31 million in 2003 to 26 million in 2013 (BPS 2014). One important trend that may affect agricultural sector development is the increasing share of older people who are <b>smallholders.</b> The 2013 agricultural census shows that about 12 % of <b>smallholders</b> in Indonesia are aged above 65 years, and 60 % of the <b>smallholders</b> are above 45 years old (BPS 2014). There are indications that older people will remain in the agricultural sector, as younger people tend to move out to other sectors. <b>Smallholders</b> are aging, and younger people are not interested in farming. The challenge for the Government of Indonesia is to formulate policy options to encourage the next generation of <b>smallholders</b> to stay in the agriculture sector (Ngadi 2014). There are some notable exceptions. For example, in the oil palm sector, the profitability of the crops has attracted new <b>smallholders</b> to cultivate the crop, either by opening new land or converting existing crops into oil palm (Feintrenie et al. 2010). Crops with strong export orientation, such as coffee and cocoa, may follow similar trends...|$|R
25|$|Some coffee states, like Costa Rica and Colombia, {{passed laws}} like the Homestead Act of 1862. They favored smallholders, held elections, {{maintained}} small militaries, and fought fewer wars. <b>Smallholder</b> arrangements prompted widespread government investment in education. Other states like El Salvador and Guatemala produced coffee on plantations, where individuals were more disenfranchised. Whether a state became a <b>smallholder</b> or plantation state depended not on factor endowments but on norms established under colonialism—namely, legal statues determining access to land, {{the background of}} the governing elites, and the degree of permitted political competition. Nugent and Robinson thereby conclude that factor endowments alone do not determine economic or political institutions.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} years after {{independence}} in 1964, Banda and the governing Malawi Congress Party actively supported the <b>smallholder</b> farming sector, as few European-owned estates remained. Disappointing <b>smallholder</b> production {{and the development of}} a policy of growing Burley tobacco on estates caused the government to transfer land to the estate sector. In 1966, Banda argued that customary land tenure was insecure and inhibited investment. A Customary Land Development Act in 1967 allowed the creation of agricultural leases of up to 99 years over Customary Land. Many estates in the Central Region growing Burley tobacco were controlled by Banda and senior officials and politicians. Land alienation speeded up in the 1970s; however the process differed from that of the early colonial period as most new estates were medium-sized farms and not in the scale of former European-owned estates. This still represented the transfer of land from smallholders to a better off elite.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, higher {{incentives}} for farmers to grow non-food biofuel crops {{combined with other}} factors, such as over development of former farm lands, rising transportation costs, climate change, growing consumer demand in China and India, and population growth, caused food shortages in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Mexico, as well as rising food prices around the globe. As of December 2007, 37 countries faced food crises, and 20 had imposed some sort of food-price controls. Some of these shortages resulted in food riots and even deadly stampedes. The International Fund for Agricultural Development posits that an increase in <b>smallholder</b> agriculture {{may be part of}} the solution to concerns about food prices and overall food security. They in part base this on the experience of Vietnam, which went from a food importer to large food exporter and saw a significant drop in poverty, due mainly to the development of <b>smallholder</b> agriculture in the country.|$|E
40|$|The {{integration}} {{of agriculture and}} forestry is commonly viewed {{as a foundation for}} sustainable livelihoods for small-scale farmers. In many tropical countries, traditional farming practices by <b>smallholders</b> include some trees or forest management for multiple purposes. This article reports on research that explores the experiences of <b>smallholders</b> in Central Java, Indonesia, who are increasingly blending aspects of their traditional farming practices with cultivation of commercial timber trees. <b>Smallholders</b> manage complex farming systems that are responding to the demands of commercial markets. <b>Smallholders</b> in Central Java typically manage a wide range of species that yield short-, medium- and long-term products that are used by households and sold into commercial markets. However, the authors’ research indicates that <b>smallholders</b> may not be optimising their forest management in relation to the potential financial returns, leading to a lower expectation of the value of forestry to their livelihoods. Support for community forestry could address several knowledge gaps amongst <b>smallholders,</b> so that community-based commercial forestry achieves its potential. © 2014, Steve Harrison, John Herbohn...|$|R

25|$|Cotton {{was first}} {{planted in the}} Shire valley by Eugene Sharrer, and the British Central Africa Company {{continued}} to grow cotton on its Chelumbo and Chikwawa estates. From 1903 the company also encouraged cotton cultivation by African smallholders in the Upper Shire District, by distributing cheap Egyptian cotton seed. The company gave instruction on the method of cultivation and agreed to buy the future crop at a guaranteed (but low) price. There was no significant shortage of land for peasant farming in the Upper Shire Valley, as the British Central Africa Company only exploited {{a small proportion of}} its land and, until the 1930s, the company tolerated squatters who did not pay rent on its land. Its tenants had to perform labour thangata or grow cotton for sale to the company, but in general there was plenty of land available for food production. The efforts of the colonial administration to introduce cotton as a peasant cash-crop were largely unsuccessful, as the prices paid to the peasants were low, so they concentrated on growing food. The British Central Africa Company Ltd also had a cotton ginnery for processing its own and <b>smallholder</b> cotton until at least 1961.

40|$|The socio-ecological {{implications}} of the soybean agricultural expansion in the Brazilian Amazon cannot be fully understood without examining the interactions between soy and small farmers. The expansion of soy in Santarém following {{the construction of the}} Cargill port in 2001 has affected local <b>smallholders,</b> but how and to what degree is the subject of significant controversy. Discourse has emerged describing the impact of soybean agricultural expansion on the small farmers of the region. One discourse, which we term the modernization discourse, depicts effects on <b>smallholders</b> like migration as natural and welfare-improving. In opposition, a second discourse, which we term the extreme pressure discourse, portrays <b>smallholders</b> as struggling to survive under social, economic, and biological pressures associated with rapid land-use change due to soy. However, characterizing smallholders’ livelihoods as vulnerable too often assumes that <b>smallholders</b> have a single, homogenous experience of the expansion of soy agriculture and that they are unable to adapt to changes. Interviews with <b>smallholders</b> who remain farming in 20 communities of rural Santarém reveal heterogeneity in farmers’ perceptions to the soybean-smallholder conflict. Understanding of vulnerability must expand to encapsulate farmers’ adaptive capacity. <b>Smallholders</b> do express a desire and capacity to maintain a rural livelihood and their farming identity amidst the land-use change.
