She expresses her love for him and implores him to repent (Robert, toi que j'aime). Robert breaks the branch and the <b>spell</b> <b>it</b> has created, and is taken into custody by Isabelle's attendants.|$|E
5|$|The {{werewolf}} {{is revealed}} to be Angelika's father, who is under the Queen's <b>spell.</b> <b>It</b> turns out that he is only able to keep on living due to an enchanted spike that is lodged into his chest and, without such, the spell is broken. Angelika is drowned by her father, becoming the 12th victim. The Brothers reach the tower while the Queen breathes an ice wind that puts out the forest fire. Delatombe notices that the Grimms have escaped and goes after them with Cavaldi. When Cavaldi refuses to kill the Grimms, Delatombe shoots him but is later impaled by Will.|$|E
25|$|The official, and correct, {{spelling}} of 'gorkha', since February 1949, is Gorkha, and not Goorkha, Goorkah, or Gurkha, as the British and Tata motors {{still choose}} to <b>spell</b> <b>it,</b> or , as the American retailer of luxury leather bags and 'fine men's accessories' has, profitably, chosen to <b>spell</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
50|$|There is some {{confusion}} {{as to the}} proper spelling of this taxon. The Index Fungorum <b>spells</b> <b>it</b> Chrysothricaceae, while the Outline of Ascomycota - 2007 <b>spells</b> <b>it</b> Chrysotrichaceae. Both spellings are commonly encountered in the literature. However, the family was originally described by Alexander Zahlbruckner in 1907, and he <b>spelled</b> <b>it</b> Chrysothricaceae, {{so that is the}} proper spelling.|$|R

25|$|Visual memory, in an {{academic}} environment, entails work with pictures, symbols, numbers, letters, and especially words. Students {{must be able to}} look at a word, form an image of that word in their minds and be able to recall the appearance of the word later. When teachers introduce a new vocabulary word, generally they write it on the chalkboard, have the children <b>spell</b> <b>it,</b> read it and then use it in a sentence. The word is then erased from the chalkboard. Students with good visual memory will recognize that same word later in their readers or other texts and will be able to recall the appearance of the word to <b>spell</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|After The Suns report, the {{newspaper}} was boycotted by most newsagents in Liverpool and many readers cancelled their orders {{and refused to}} buy it from newsagents; and from then afterwards many in Liverpool refer to The Sun newspaper as The Scum. Some even refuse to say the name or <b>spell</b> <b>it</b> as The S*n. The Hillsborough Justice Campaign organised a less successful national boycott that had some impact on the paper's sales nationally.|$|E

25|$|When {{my husband}} was {{translating}} the Book of Mormon, I wrote a part of it, as he dictated each sentence, word for word, {{and when he came}} to proper names he could not pronounce, or long words, he spelled them out, and while I was writing them, if I made any mistake in spelling, he would stop me and correct my spelling although it was impossible for him to see how I was writing them down at the time. Even the word Sarah he could not pronounce at first, but had to <b>spell</b> <b>it,</b> and I would pronounce it for him.|$|E
25|$|At the Residencia de Estudiantes in Madrid, García Lorca befriended Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí {{and many}} other {{creative}} artists who were, or would become, influential across Spain. He was taken under the wing of the poet Juan Ramón Jiménez, becoming close to playwright Eduardo Marquina and Gregorio Martínez Sierra, the Director of Madrid's Teatro Eslava. In 1919–20, at Sierra's invitation, he wrote and staged his first play, The Butterfly's Evil <b>Spell.</b> <b>It</b> was a verse play dramatising the impossible love between a cockroach and a butterfly, with a supporting cast of other insects; it was laughed off the stage by an unappreciative public after only four performances and influenced García Lorca's attitude to the theatre-going public {{for the rest of}} his career. He would later claim that Mariana Pineda, written in 1927, was, in fact, his first play. During the time at the Residencia de Estudiantes he pursued degrees in law and philosophy, though he had more interest in writing than study.|$|E

5000|$|However, {{historical}} records {{shows that the}} name has been variously spelled by the Spanish chroniclers. Conquistador Miguel de Loarca, in his extreme exploratory survey trip of the archipelago, first mentioned and <b>spelled</b> <b>it</b> [...] "Beslin" [...] in his historical accounts “Relacion de los Yslas Filipinas” in 1582, {{as well as in}} the Confirmaciones de Encomienda (1616-1700) which Bislig was under the encomienda of Alferez Juan delas Marianas in 1619.

500|$|Before the {{formation}} of Alice in Chains, then-drummer Layne Staley landed his first gig as a vocalist when he auditioned to sing for a local glam metal band known as Sleze after receiving some encouragement from his stepbrother Ken Elmer. [...] Other {{members of this group}} at that time were guitarists Johnny Bacolas and Zoli Semanate, drummer James Bergstrom, and bassist Byron Hansen. This band went through several lineup changes culminating with Nick Pollock as their sole guitarist and Bacolas switching to bass before discussions arose about changing their name to Alice in Chains. This was prompted by a conversation that Bacolas had with a singer from another band about backstage passes. Due to concerns over the reference to female bondage, the group ultimately chose to <b>spell</b> <b>it</b> differently as Alice N' Chains to allay any parental concerns, though Staley's mother Nancy McCallum has said she was still not happy with this name at first.|$|E
500|$|Ironsword: Wizards & Warriors II {{consists}} of four levels called [...] "domains," [...] each named after the four elementals. In each domain, Kuros must find a golden artifact that belongs to the domain's [...] "Animal King" [...] {{and return it to}} him. Upon doing so, the path to {{the second part of the}} domain will appear. In the second part, Kuros must find the magic spell necessary to defeat the boss – the domain's Elemental. Without the <b>spell,</b> <b>it</b> is impossible to damage the boss. Once the elemental in each stage has been destroyed, Kuros obtains a piece of the IronSword, which is needed for the final battle on Icefire Mountain. Throughout the game, players must collect items, spells, and money to progress. Money helps buy magic spells, more powerful weapons, shields, helmets, keys to open locked treasure chests, and additional food. Treasure chests — located throughout the game — can contain one of the following items: Additional money, magic spells, or weapon and armor upgrades. In each domain, players can visit inns where they can buy food, keys, or items; they may also participate in a [...] "Bonus chance" [...] game where they may gamble their money to see which cup a bouncing skull will fall into.|$|E

500|$|Salvatore created Drizzt on {{the spur}} of the moment. He was under {{pressure}} to create a sidekick for Wulfgar in the Icewind Dale series. Salvatore had sent an early version of The Crystal Shard (what would become his first published novel) to TSR, and one day Kirchoff called him. She was on her way to a marketing meeting concerning the book, and informed him that they could not use one of the characters. He asked for time to think, but she was already late for the meeting. Off the top of his head, Salvatore said he had a Dark Elf. Kirchoff was skeptical, but Salvatore convinced her it would be fine because he was just a sidekick. She asked his name, and he replied Drizzt Do'Urden. She asked if he could <b>spell</b> <b>it,</b> and he said [...] "not a chance". Recalling Drizzt's creation in an interview, Salvatore said, [...] "I don't know where it came from. I guess that Gary Gygax just did such an amazing job in creating the drow elves that something about them got stuck in the back of my head. Thank God!" [...] Although many readers have assumed that Drizzt is based on one of the many Dungeons & Dragons role-playing campaigns that the author has played, this is not the case. Salvatore's main influences were classical literature and works of J. R. R. Tolkien. [...] "I like to think of Drizzt as a cross between Daryth from Darkwalker on Moonshae and Aragorn from The Lord of the Rings." [...] Salvatore calls Drizzt [...] "the classic romantic hero—misunderstood, holding to a code of ideals even when the going gets tough, and getting no appreciation for it most of the time." ...|$|E
