She said that the federal government tried to pressure her into eliminating MPRs at the eleventh hour of the loan guarantee negotiations to help secure the trade deal. Dunderdale said that while <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> look at minimum processing requirements, she was not willing to tie it to the loan guarantee.|$|E
5|$|From the outset, Chamarro {{performed}} a delicate balancing act. Her choice {{to lead the}} Assembly, , {{was rejected by the}} UNO vote, which chose Myriam Arguello and Chamorro kept her word not to go against the vote. Her Vice President-elect Virgilio Godoy was in favor of hard-line policies to exclude the Sandinistas, but Chamorro retained Daniel Ortega's brother, Humberto Ortega, as a military leader, granting herself the position of Defense Minister and naming Humberto to second-in-command as the Chief of Staff. For this, Chamorro's critics accused her of supporting the Sandinistas, but it proved to be a valuable political move, as it demonstrated that, {{for the good of the}} nation, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> compromise in ways that fostered reconciliation. She also appointed three FSLN cabinet members, including one for agrarian reform.|$|E

Maria Theresa had sent Kaunitz on a secret mission to Berlin to offer a truce. In a second trip, she offered a settlement, and finally wrote to Catherine in Russia to ask for assistance. When Joseph discovered his mother's maneuvering behind his back, he furiously offered to resign. His mother enlisted the assistance she needed. Catherine offered to mediate the dispute; if her assistance was unacceptable, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> send fifty thousand troops to augment the Prussian force, {{despite the fact that}} she disliked Frederick and her alliance with him was strictly defensive. Frederick withdrew portions of his force in mid-September. In October, Joseph withdrew most of his army to the Bohemian border and Frederick withdrew his remaining troops into Prussia. Two small forces of hussars and dragoons remained in Bohemia to provide a winter cordon; these forces allowed Joseph and Frederick to keep an eye on each other while their diplomats negotiated at Teschen.|$|E

25|$|The American Dream is {{the belief}} that through hard work and determination, any United States {{immigrant}} can achieve a better life, usually in terms of financial prosperity and enhanced personal freedom of choice. According to historians, the rapid economic and industrial expansion of the U.S. is not simply a function of being a resource rich, hard working, and inventive country, but the belief that anybody could get a share of the country's wealth if he or <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> work hard. This dream has been a major factor in attracting immigrants to the United States.|$|E
25|$|Puyi's {{second choice}} {{for his wife}} was Wanrong, a Daur. She married Puyi in 1922 and became his Empress. Her father, Rong Yuan (榮源), was a Minister of Domestic Affairs. She was {{considered}} beautiful and came from a wealthy family. By Puyi's own account, he abandoned Wanrong in the bridal chamber {{and went back to}} his own room. He maintained that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> be a wife in name only, in order to carry the title of Empress. The couple's relationship was good initially, and Puyi showed preference over Wenxiu for Wanrong and displayed trust in her. However, after Wenxiu left in 1931, Puyi blamed Wanrong and stopped speaking to her and ignored her presence. She became addicted to opium, and eventually died in a prison in Yanji, Jilin after being arrested by Chinese Communist soldiers.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} 1899, {{personal}} disputes arose {{within the}} Golden Dawn, which Farr described as an 'astral jar' between other senior members (Adepts), and a secret society within the Isis-Urania Lodge called The Sphere Group, created by Farr in 1896. There were also factions within the Order that resented a woman having authority as Chief Adept. Farr eventually believed that the temple should be closed down, writing to Mathers in January 1900 and offering her resignation as his representative, but that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> carry on until a successor was found. Mathers' reply shocked and amazed her, for it claimed that Westcott had committed fraud and forged some of the foundational documents and charters of the Order. After waiting a few days she consulted with Yeats, and they jointly wrote to Westcott requesting an explanation of, and a reply to, Mathers' charges. Westcott denied the charges, and a seven-member committee of Adepts was formed to further investigate Mathers, asking for proof. Mathers sent a belligerent reply, refusing to produce proof, asserting his authority and dismissing Farr from her position as his representative on 23 March. The Adepts in London continued their investigation, and subsequently expelled Mathers in 1901. Farr, Yeats and Horniman (who returned after having been expelled earlier by Mathers) attempted to reorganize the Order, but met with limited success. Farr remained in her Chief Adept position for a time, but resigned in January 1902 {{in the wake of}} a fraud scandal concerning associates of Mathers that exposed the once secret society to public ridicule.|$|E

Martínez gave these to one of her clients, Daniel Orlando Garza who contacted two Mexican hitmen from Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Israel Olivarez Cepeda and Heriberto Puentes Pizaña, who killed Fischer and then escaped to Mexico.

Stegall also praised Torv and Acevedo's performances, and called the episode the best she's watched in a while.

[...] "I would have been a terrible mother," [...] she told Berg, [...] "because I'm basically a very selfish human being." [...] She felt she had partially experienced parenthood through her much younger siblings, which fulfilled any need to have children of her own. Rumors have existed since the 1930s that Hepburn may have been a lesbian or bisexual, which she often joked about. In 2007, William J. Mann released a biography of the actress in which he argued this was the case. In response to this speculation about her aunt, Katharine Houghton said, [...] "I've never discovered any evidence whatsoever that she was a lesbian."

She viewed [...] "true history"the way she saw, defined, and proselytized itas a potential common ground between North and South, and also believed {{it to be a}} potent political weapon in support of the causes she espoused. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> alter the historical record to make her point—in a speech in Dallas in 1916 she claimed that [...] "the negroes in the South were never called slaves.

She’s on the wrestling team, speaks regularly of injuring Puck, and, in one hallway smackdown against the jealous Santana Lopez, proved she was {{a lot more than just}} bark.

On the contrary, she thinks she's the bee's knees. When 'Puck serenaded her with Queen's [...] "Fat-Bottomed Girls," [...] she rebuffed him, saying, 'I look like America looks, and just like America, I need more than just a song to get my juices flowing'." ...|$|E

Cyrus also worked on the films The Night Before (2015) and A Very Murray Christmas (2015) during this period; both roles were cameos.

This was confirmed by her manager who claimed <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> end her contract with RCA Records if they refused to let her release a free album. Cyrus was the host of the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards, and gave a surprise performance of a new song [...] "Dooo It!" [...] (2015) during the show's finale. Immediately following the performance, Cyrus announced that her fifth studio album, Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz (2015), was available for free streaming on SoundCloud.
