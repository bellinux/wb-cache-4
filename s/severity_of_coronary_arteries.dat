40|$|Objective. To {{investigate}} {{the changes in}} serum Myeloid-Related Protein 8 / 14 (MRP 8 / 14) and Eosinophil Cationic Protein (ECP) levels in patients with different types of coronary artery diseases (CAD) and assess the value of MRP 8 / 14 and ECP detection in predicting CAD. Methods. 178 patients were divided into CAD group including unstable angina pectoris (UAP), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and stable angina pectoris (SAP). Thirty-six individuals with normal coronary artery served as the control group. Serum MRP 8 / 14 and ECP were measured by ELISA. The severity of coronary artery stenosis was assessed by the numbers of involved coronary artery branches and the sum of Gensini scores. Results. The MRP 8 / 14 levels were significantly higher in AMI and UAP group than SAP and control group (P 0. 05). The ECP was significantly increased in three impaired coronary arteries and obviously correlated with Gensini score (P< 0. 01), whereas the MRP 8 / 14 was obviously positively correlated with CRP (P< 0. 01). Conclusions. Increased MRP 8 / 14 levels suggest the instability of the atherosclerotic plaque. ECP reflects the <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> stenosis, predicting atherosclerosis burden. They may become the new biomarkers of CAD...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Free {{fatty acids}} (FFAs) have been {{reported}} to be a marker in the development of atherosclerosis. However, no data is currently available with regard to the relation of FFA to the severity of atherosclerosis. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the relation of free fatty acids levels to the severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) in non-diabetic patients. Methods: A total of 766 consecutive individuals (496 CAD and 266 controls) who had a angina-like chest pain and received coronary angiography were enrolled in the study. FFA was measured using enzymatic assay and the <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> was assessed by Gensini score system. The association of plasma FFAs levels with the severity of CAD was finally investigated. Results: There were significantly higher FFAs levels in CAD group compared with those in control group (p =  0. 040). FFAs levels were positively correlated with Gensini score (r =  0. 120, p =  0. 008) and elevated according to the tertiles of Gensini score (p for trend 0. 002). Multivariate leaner regression analysis also proved that FFAs levels were independently associated with the Gensini score (β =  0. 106, p =  0. 018) after adjusting for traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Conclusions: The present study showed that FFAs levels were positively and independently associated with the severity of CAD, suggested that further study may be needed to confirm our findings...|$|E
40|$|Background. Recently, {{several studies}} suggest that galectin- 9 (Gal- 9) might play {{a pivotal role in}} the {{pathogenesis}} of autoimmune diseases. However, the exact role of Gal- 9 in atherosclerosis remains to be elucidated. Methods. Serum Gal- 9, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interferon- (IFN-) γ, interleukin- (IL-) 4, IL- 17, and transforming growth factor- (TGF-) β 1 were measured. The effect of Gal- 9 on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was investigated in patients with normal coronary artery (NCA). Results. The lowest level of Gal- 9 was found in the ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) group, followed by the non-ST-segment elevation ACS (NSTEACS), the NCA, and the stable angina pectoris (SAP) groups, respectively. Additionally, Gal- 9 was found to be independently associated with hs-CRP, lipoprotein(a), and creatinine. Notably, Gal- 9 was also noted to be an independent predictor of the Gensini score. Moreover, Gal- 9 suppressed T-helper 17 (Th 17) and expanded regulatory T cells (Tregs), resulting in decreased IL- 17 production and increased secretion of TGF-β 1. Conclusions. Serum Gal- 9 is associated with not only coronary artery disease (CAD), but also the <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> stenosis. Gal- 9 can expand Tregs and suppress Th 17 development in activated PBMC, implying that Gal- 9 has the potential to dampen the development of atherosclerosis and may be a new therapy for CAD...|$|E

40|$|Background: Coronary {{artery disease}} (CAD) and {{myocardial}} infarction {{are the most}} common causes of mortality and morbidity all over the world. Aspirin resistance {{is an important part of}} therapeutic failure in patients who experience several atherosclerotic events despite aspirin therapy. Different studies have reported aspirin resistance between 5 % and 45 % all over the world. According to different responses to aspirin therapy in countries and lack of adequate studies on aspirin resistance in Iran, this study was designed for evaluation of aspirin resistance in ischemic patients. Materials and Methods: Total 170 patients with documented coronary artery stenosis with were enrolled in this cross-sectional prospective study. Two cc urine samples were obtained from all the subjects. Then a questionnaire including questions about major risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, obesity and smoking) was completed for each patient. Thromboxane B 2 level in urine was measured two times for each patient by one kit of via ELISA method. Gensini modified was usedfor assessment of <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> involvement. Data were analyzed via SPSS 16. with general linear model (univariate). Results: 75. 3 % of studied patients were aspirin resistant. There was significant relationship between angiography score and aspirin resistance (P< 0. 001). Our results also showed that aspirin resistance is more common in studied women than men (P= 0. 003). Significant correlation was observed between diabetes and aspirin resistance in studied subjects (P= 0. 023).

40|$|Background: In the {{previous}} studies, fasting insulin and apo-lipoproteins are {{considered as one}} of the risk-factor of coronary artery disease (CAD) but did not have the same results. In this study, we attempted to define the association of high fasting insulin and apo-lipoproteins of serum in non-diabetic patients who were afflicted with coronary arteries disease with <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> involvement. Materials and Methods: This study was conducted between September 2011 and February 2012 on three groups, each one consisting of 100 members while using angiographic scores of Gensini with three equal groups with low, medium, and high stenosis of coronary arteries. The evaluation of non-diabetic patients afflicted with CADs, included the fasting glucose level less than 126 mg/dl or non-consumption of blood glucose reduction drugs or negativity history of diabetes. Results: In this study, there were 300 non-diabetic patients afflicted with CAD in three groups of low, medium, and high extremity. Due to attained results, the patients afflicted with high CAD had a higher level of insulin (18. 3 ± 0. 8) in relation with low and medium groups (P < 0. 001). As it was observed, the level of serum apo-lipoproteins of A 1 (APO-A 1) in low group of CAD (175 ± 36. 4) is meaningfully higher than its quantity in high-CAD group (158 ± 42. 4, P < 0. 001). Furthermore, the quantity of serum apo-lipoproteins of B (APO-B) in mild CAD group (139 ± 30. 4) is meaningfully less than severe CAD group (155. 21 ± 29. 7, P < 0. 001). Conclusion: Our findings show that insulin, APO-A 1, APO-B, and total cholesterol measurement is a good case for defining the severity of coronary artery involvement, while high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, and triglyceride are not important risk-factors...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Lipid {{oxidation}} and {{generation of}} free radicals are important {{factors contributing to}} the formation of atherosclerotic plaque. Bilirubin is supposed to play a protective role against atherosclerosis, coronary artery diseases (CAD) and inflammation for its strong antioxidant property. Thus, this study aims at investigating the relationship of bilirubin level with the severity and type of coronary artery stenosis (CAS) in different patient groups. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study 200 consecutive patients, who underwent elective angiography in Madani Heart hospital, Tabriz, Iran, were selected and their blood samples were measured for total, direct, and indirect bilirubin level, with Diazo method using colorimetric technique. Following angiography, comparisons were made between the severity and location of CAS and therapeutic follow-up plan with total, direct, and indirect bilirubin level. Results: Of 200 studied patients, 129 (64. 5 %) and 71 (35. 5 %) subjects were male and female, respectively. The cases were classified into 5 subgroups based on angiography results as follows: 59 (29. 5 %) cases with normal angiography, 11 cases (5. 5 %) with minimal CAD, 56 cases (28 %) with single vessel involvement, 35 (17. 5 %) cases with two vessel involvement and 39 cases (19. 5 %) with three vessel involvement. The mean total bilirubin level was 1. 47 ± 0. 8 mg/dl, 1. 27 ± 0. 12 mg/dl, 1. 27 ± 0. 06 mg/dl, 1. 6 ± 0. 04 mg/dl and 0. 98 ± 0. 05 mg/dl, respectively for the cases with above order. The mean difference in serum total bilirubin between normal angiography group and three-vessel involvement group was 0. 49 mg/dl (P <. 0001). There was a significant inverse relation between bilirubin level (total, direct and indirect) and number of involved vessels and involvement intensity increased as serum bilirubin level decreased. <b>Severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> stenosis as well as the number of involved vessels increased as serum bilirubin level decreased. Conclusion: According to results, there was a significant inverse relation between serum bilirubin level and coronary involvement (type and intensity).

40|$|Background: Patient {{prognosis}} {{has been}} shown to directly correlate with the <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease diagnosed by coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). Although the presence <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> calcium has been associated with increased incidence of ischemic stroke, there are no data on the incidence of ischemic stroke based upon the <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease by CCTA. Therefore, we sought to investigate the rate of major adverse cardiovascular events, including ischemic stroke, based upon the <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease by CCTA over a 6 -year period in a high-volume single military center. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of all CCTA studies to evaluate the incidence of all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and late revascularization (> 90 days following CCTA) from January 2005 until July 2012. We reviewed 1518 CCTA reports, dividing patients into groups with obstructive (≥ 50 % stenosis), non-obstructive (< 50 % stenosis), and no <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease (no angiographic disease). Subsequent major adverse cardiovascular events data (incidence of all-cause mortality, ischemic stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and late revascularization) were obtained. Results: Over a review period of 6 years with a resultant median follow-up period of 22 months (interquartile range = 13 – 34 months), the major adverse cardiovascular events rate was significantly higher with obstructive <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease compared to both non-obstructive <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease and no <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease (8. 9 % vs 0. 7 %, p < 0. 001; 8. 9 % vs 1. 6 %, p < 0. 001).

The {{aim of the}} present study was to analyze the <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> lesions and the prognosis of thyroid dysfunction patients admitted for coronary angiography (CAG). MethodsFrom July 2011 to July 2012, 605 consecutive patients with suspected coronary heart disease admitted for CAG were selected. The patients were divided into three groups, based on their thyroid function prior to CAG: euthyroid group (n= 455 patients), low T 3 syndrome group (n= 96 patients), and hypothyroidism group (n= 54 patients). All patients underwent CAG. Then the <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> lesions was assessed by Gensini scores. All patients were followed up for major adverse cardiac events. ResultsThe prevalence of CHD in low T 3 syndrome group and hypothyroidism group was significantly higher than that in the euthyroid group (p< 0. 001 and p= 0. 004, respectively). Moreover, the <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> lesions in low T 3 syndrome group and hypothyroidism group was significantly greater than that in the euthyroid group (all p< 0. 001). Multinomial logistic regression analysis demonstrated that low T 3 syndrome was an independent risk factor <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> moderate [odds ratio (OR) = 4. 268, 95 % CI: 3. 294 – 7. 450, p= 0. 016] and severe (OR= 4. 294, 95 % CI: 2. 259 – 9. 703, p< 0. 001) lesions. The mean duration of follow-up was 15. 3 ± 3. 8 months; patients with thyroid dysfunction had a significantly worse prognosis as compared to those in the euthyroid group for the composite end-point (p< 0. 01).

RESULTS: Among the 82 patients included in the study, in CAD – group (mean age was 66. 76 ± 9. 12 years) and non-CAD group (mean age was 64. 80 ± 8. 30 years), patients in CAD group had BMI (mean 28. 17 ± 3. 32 kg/m 2) and in non-CAD group had BMI (mean 28. 76 ± 4. 68 kg/m 2). Patients in CAD group had waist/height ratio (mean 1. 76 ± 7. 56) and in non-CAD group had waist/height ratio (mean 0. 57 ± 0. 08). Patient in CAD group had waist/hip ratio (mean 0. 93 ± 0. 06) and in non-CAD group (mean 0. 88 ± 0. 07). Thirty seven patients (45. 1 %) had no <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease (Gensini score = 0), 15 patients (18. 3 %) had mild disease (Gensini score = 1 - 32), 14 patients (17. 1 %) had moderate disease (Gensini score = 32 - 58), 16 patients (19. 5 %) had severe disease (Gensini score ≥ 58). CONCLUSION: There is a significant positive correlation between waist/hip ratio and presence and <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease among Kosovar patients...|$|R
40|$|Introduction/AimsHigh {{blood glucose}} (HBG) on {{admission}} {{is a major}} common metabolic disorder in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI). However, only few data have examined its predictive performance over established risk score. The aim of our {{study was to determine}} if hyperglycemia on admission correlates to <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> lesions evaluated by the Synthax score. MethodsWe evaluated 93 patients admitted for MI. The population was divided into: hyperglycemia (glycemia on admission> 1. 10 g/l) and non-hyper-glycemia (< 1. 10 g/l) regardless of previous diabetic status. Results 63. 4 % of our patients presented with hyperglycemia on admission. Patients aged over 65 years old represented 89 % of the population studied. There were significant differences in baseline clinical status established by calculating CHADSVASC score (2, 60 ± 1, 54 vs 1, 5 ± 1, 05; p= 0. 01). Biological status differed significantly between the two groups especially troponine Ic, LDL cholesterol and triglyceride which were higher in HBG patients (32, 20 ± 63, 93 vs 17, 64 ± 31, 16 p= 0. 014; 0, 94 ± 0, 33 vs 0, 87 ± 0, 27 p= 0. 015; 1, 45 ± 0, 67 vs 1, 16 ±, 42 p= 0. 04 respectively). Synthax score was higher in the hyperglycemia group 11, 21 ± 8, 377 vs 7, 50 ± 8, 782 p= 0. 03. A multivariate linear regression analysis showed that hyperglycemia on admission was an independent predictor <b>of</b> <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> lesions. ConclusionIn patients with MI, hyperglycemia on admission predicts <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> lesions so we should be more careful with this population...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{assess the}} {{correlation}} between body mass index and the risk factors and <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease. Methods Five thousand two hundred and ninety-four patients with suspected <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease,who underwent <b>coronary</b> angiography from Jan. 2001 to Mar. 2007 at 20 medical centers in China,were enrolled in the present study. The patients were divided into normal,overweight and obesity group,and body mass index(BMI),blood pressure(BP),blood glucose,serum total cholesterol(TC),triglyceride(TG),low-density lipoprotein cholesterol(LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol(HDL-C) were measured. The correlation between BMI and the risk factors and <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease(CAD) was analyzed. And {{the correlation between}} gender in different BMI group and CAD rick factors was also evaluated. Results The BMI was correlated with BP,TC,blood glucose,age and HDL-C(P 0. 05) in male group. The BMI was correlated with BP,TC,TG,LDL-C and high blood glucose(P 0. 05) in female group. Logistic regression analysis showed that hypertension was a prominent predictor of overweight and obesity(OR= 2. 102, 95 %CI 1. 762 ~ 2. 509).

40|$|Background: Angiopoietin- 2 (Ang- 2) plays {{a crucial}} role in hypoxia-induced {{angiogenesis}} and is expressed only in sites of vascular remodeling. Ang- 2 expression can be regulated by hypoxia inducible factors and other regulators with exposure to hypoxia. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the influence <b>of</b> percutaneous <b>coronary</b> intervention (PCI) on serum Ang- 2 concentrations, and analyze the correlation between serum Ang- 2 and the <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> stenosis in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). Methods: Sixty-four patients with CHD were selected as the study group, each undergone PCI. Thirty-two healthy subjects were selected as the control group. Pre-PCI and post-PCI serum Ang- 2 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> stenosis was evaluated using angiographic Gensini scores, and the coronary collateral vessels were scored according to Rentrop′s classification. Results: Concentrations of pre-PCI serum Ang- 2 in the study group were significantly higher than those in the control group (4625. 06 ± 1838. 06 vs. 1945. 74 ± 1588. 17 pg/ml, P < 0. 01); however, concentrations of post-PCI serum Ang- 2 were significantly lower than those of pre-PCI (3042. 63 ± 1845. 33 pg/ml vs. 4625. 06 ± 1838. 06 pg/ml, P < 0. 01). Concentrations of pre-PCI serum Ang- 2 were significantly correlated with Gensini scores (r = 0. 488, P < 0. 01); however, the decrease in serum Ang- 2 after PCI was not correlated with Gensini scores, coronary collateral vessel grading, or left ventricular ejection fraction. Conclusions: Serum Ang- 2 concentrations significantly increased in patients with CHD, and PCI treatment significantly decreased these concentrations. Serum Ang- 2 concentrations, but not the decrease in serum Ang- 2 concentrations, were significantly correlated with the <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> stenosis.

40|$|Background : Myeloperoxidase (MPO) has an {{important}} role in the both processes of inflammation and oxidative stress. It plays proatherogenic role via low-density lipoprotein oxidation, functional inactivation of the high-density lipoprotein and endothelial dysfunction, and seems to be involved in the atherogenesis <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries.</b> This study designed to evaluate the association between the plasma MPO levels and angiographic <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease (CAD) in patients with the stable CAD. Materials and Methods: Sixty-eight patients who had documented CAD with angiography and 66 subjects who had normal angiography were selected as case and the control groups for this study, respectively. Gensini scoring system was used for evaluation <b>of</b> <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> stenosis. Plasma MPO and C-reactiveprotein (CRP) levels of both case and control groups were determined. Results: Plasma MPO levels and CRP levels were significantly higher in CAD patients (P < 0. 001), and plasma levels of MPO and CRP were correlated with Genssini scores. Conclusions: Our findings indicated that the plasma MPO levels increase in patients with stable CAD and hence that, it can be used as adiagnostic factor to predict the <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> atherosclerosis severity in stable CAD patients; However, it needs further widespread investigations to achieve an accurate cut point...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the correlation between the <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> lesions in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and levels of estrogen, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and matrix metalloproteinase- 9 (MMP- 9). A total of 65 patients with ACS, 33 patients with stable angina pectoris (SAP) and 36 healthy controls were randomly enrolled. Patients with ACS were subdivided into two groups: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI; n= 30) and unstable angina pectoris (UAP; n= 35). Serum levels of estrogen, hs-CRP and MMP- 9 were detected in the four groups of subjects. Serum estrogen levels in patients with AMI, UAP and SAP were significantly lower than those in the control group (P< 0. 05). Estrogen levels were also significantly different among the AMI, UAP and SAP groups (P< 0. 05), with a progressive increase across the three respective groups. Compared with healthy subjects, patients with AMI had the highest levels of hs-CRP and MMP- 9, followed in descending order by those with UAP and SAP (P< 0. 05). Levels of hs-CRP and MMP- 9 were also significantly different among the AMI, UAP and SAP groups (P< 0. 05). Serum estrogen levels were negatively correlated with hs-CRP and MMP- 9 levels (r=- 0. 6634 and- 0. 6878, respectively; both P< 0. 05). hs-CRP and MMP- 9 levels correlated positively (r= 0. 7208, P< 0. 05). The number <b>of</b> stenosed <b>coronary</b> vessels was negatively correlated with estrogen levels (r=- 0. 6467, P< 0. 05), and posi-tively correlated with hs-CRP and MMP- 9 levels (r= 0. 6519 and 0. 6835, respectively; both P< 0. 05). In conclusion, serum estrogen, hs-CRP and MMP- 9 levels were significantly correlated with the <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> lesions. There was also a significant correlation between serum estrogen, hs-CRP and MMP- 9 levels. These data indicate that serum estrogen, hs-CRP and MMP- 9 have the potential to be used as biomarkers for evaluating the <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> lesions and the stability <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> plaques...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Determination of the QT {{interval}} dispersion {{by means}} of a standard ECG at rest has been widely used for cardiovascular risk assessment during the last 15  years as one of the recent explanations for the development of life threatening ventricular arrhythmias. However, {{little is known about the}} relation between QT dispersion and the <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> atherosclerosis as defined by SYNTAX score. Aim of work:: The present study was done to assess the correlation between QTc dispersion and the <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease in acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) detected by SYNTAX score. Patients and methods: It included 50 patients who were non-diabetic, non-hypertensive and diagnosed as acute STEMI within 6  months undergoing coronary angiography in the cath. lab. of Assiut University Hospital. QT dispersion was calculated as the difference between the longest (QT max) and the shortest QT (QTmin) interval recorded by standard 12 lead ECG. The QT interval was corrected by using Bazett’s formula (QTc = QT/square root of R-R interval in seconds). Corrected QT dispersion (QTcd) was defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum QTc for a given heart rate. The SYNTAX score is calculated by syntax calculator, a new tool to grade the complexity <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease. Results: Out of 50 participating patients, there were 43 (86 %) males with mean age 53. 9  ±  12. 1  years. The mean QTc dispersion was 83. 1  ±  20. 3  ms, while mean SYNTAX score was 11. 6  ±  6. 1. There is a strong positive correlation between QTc dispersion and SYNTAX score. This was not related to age, gender, risk factors or family history of ischemic heart disease. Of note, there was a relationship between QTc dispersion and serum creatinine. Conclusions: Our study concluded that there is a significant positive correlation between corrected QT dispersion and <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease as assessed by SYNTAX score...|$|R
