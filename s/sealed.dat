40|$|Elastic Leak for a Better <b>Seal</b> Elastomeric <b>seals</b> {{are widely}} used to block fluids of high pressure. When {{multiple}} <b>seals</b> are installed in series and the spaces between the <b>seals</b> contain compressible fluids (e. g., gas or gas–liquid mixture), the <b>seals</b> often damage sequentially, one after another.

When individual <b>seals</b> leak elastically, fluid fills the spaces between the <b>seals.</b> Instead of damage one after another, all the <b>seals</b> share the load.
