30|$|Two {{datasets}} {{are used}} in the evaluation process. The first dataset, which we will refer to as the Soundwalks data set contains 178 sound files uploaded by the authors to the Soundwalks.org website. The 178 sound files were recorded during seven separate field recording sessions, lasting anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes each and sampled at 44.1 [*]KHz. Each session was recorded continuously and then hand-segmented by the authors into segments lasting between 2 – 60 [*]s. The recordings took place at three light rail <b>stops</b> (75 <b>segments),</b> outside a stadium during a football game (60 segments), at a skatepark (16 segments), and at a college campus (27 segments). To obtain tags, study participants were directed to a website containing ten random sounds from the set and were asked to provide one or more single-word descriptive tags for each sound. With 90 responses, each sound was tagged an average of 4.62 times. We have used 88 of the most popular tags as our vocabulary.|$|R
40|$|Production of vowel-oral stop consonant-vowel utterances {{involves}} {{movement of}} articulators from the articulatory {{position of the}} initial vowel towards that of the oral stop closure, and then {{to that of the}} final vowel. As the closure segments have zero or low signal energy, linear predictive coding (LPC) -based estimation of vocal tract shape fails during stop closure. This paper reports a technique for estimation of place of articulation during stop closures by performing bivariate polynomial modeling on vocal tract area values during transition segments preceding and following the closure. The technique with second-degree polynomial modeling was found to be suitable for estimating the place of maximum constriction during <b>stop</b> closure <b>segments</b> of vowel-consonant-vowel utterances with bilabial, alveolar, and velar stops. The estimated places compared well with the actual constriction locations observed from the articulatory data.

40|$|OBJETIVO: investigar, com auxílio de análise acústica, o estabelecimento do contraste fonológico de produções de um sujeito com transtorno fonológico que apresenta neutralização (pela análise de oitiva) do contraste entre as oclusivas {{alveolar}} e velar. MÉTODOS: foram analisadas as produções das oclusivas /t/ e /k/ combinadas com as vogais /a/ e /u/ na posição acentuada em dois sujeitos - com e sem transtorno fonológico - ambos do sexo masculino, com faixa etária entre 5 e 6 anos. Os parâmetros fonético-acústicos analisados incluíram a inspeção acústica da forma de onda, os parâmetros relativos às características espectrais do burst; os parâmetros acústicos relativos às características acústicas das vogais adjacentes às oclusivas e os parâmetros acústicos relativos ao padrão temporal. RESULTADOS: nas produções da criança com transtorno fonológico observou-se a presença de contrastes encobertos entre as oclusivas investigadas, marcadas tanto pelo uso inadequado quanto pelo correto das pistas fonéticas, mas com valores insuficientes. Nas produções da criança sem transtorno fonológico observou-se o uso de pelo menos uma pista fonética relativa às principais características de um segmento oclusivo que, com magnitude suficiente, propicia o resgate do contraste entre /t/ e /k/ pelos ouvintes. Nas produções de ambos os sujeitos as pistas fonéticas foram dependentes do contexto vocálico. CONCLUSÃO: um determinado contraste fônico pode ser entendido como uma constelação de pistas fonéticas que variam em sua interdependência e significância perceptual. PURPOSE: to investigate, {{using an}} acoustic analysis, {{the establishment of}} phonological contrast between alveolar and velar stop sounds in a child with phonological disorders that neutralizes this contrast. METHODS: productions of stop /t/ and /k/ sounds combined with the vowels /a/ and /u/ in the stressed position were investigated in two male children between 5 and 6 -year old, one with phonological disorders {{and the other with}} no disorder. The analyzed acoustic parameters included acoustic waveform inspection, acoustic parameters related to spectral burst characteristics, acoustic parameters related to the characteristics of vowels adjacent to occlusive sounds and acoustic parameters related to temporal patterns of the productions. RESULTS: findings from this study indicated presence of covert contrast in the two stop sounds produced by the child with phonological disorders, marked by both inadequate phonetic cues and adequate phonetic cues, but with insufficient values. Productions of the child without phonological contrast evidenced the use of at least one phonetic cue related to the primary acoustic characteristics of <b>stop</b> <b>segments,</b> which allows for auditory perception of the contrast between /t/ and /k/ sounds. The productions of both children - with and without phonological disorders - were vocalic context dependent.
