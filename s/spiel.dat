25|$|A Purim <b>spiel</b> was {{historically}} a comic dramatization that {{attempted to}} convey the saga of the Purim story. By the 18th century, {{in some parts of}} Eastern Europe, the Purim plays had evolved into broad-ranging satires with music and dance for which the story of Esther {{was little more than a}} pretext. Indeed, by the mid-19th century, some were even based on other biblical stories. Today, Purim spiels can revolve around anything relating to Jews and Judaism that will bring cheer and comic relief to an audience celebrating the day.|$|E
500|$|On the Seventh Finals Week, each finalist sang a song {{chosen for}} them by a fellow Idol based on these {{assigned}} pairings: Magdangal and Nieto, Marcelo and Mendoza, Chavez and Dingle. After the night's performances, guest judge Mo Twister confidently said that Dingle would be eliminated the next night and even wagered {{that he would go}} to work in a dress for a week if his prediction proved wrong. Dingle was indeed eliminated the following night. [...] The Big Band Week became a [...] "mini-concert", as each of the remaining four finalists performed two song numbers with a short <b>spiel</b> to the audience in between. [...] The following week featured special segments about the final three contenders: Marcelo, Magdangal, and Nieto.|$|E
500|$|Other {{characters}} catch our notice—Mr. Bascombe, the pompous mill owner, Mrs. Mullin, {{the widow}} {{who runs the}} carousel and, apparently, Billy; a dancing bear; an acrobat. [...] But what draws us in is the intensity with which Julie regards Billy—the way she stands frozen, staring at him, while everyone else at the fair is swaying {{to the rhythm of}} Billy's <b>spiel.</b> [...] And as Julie and Billy ride together on the swirling carousel, and the stage picture surges with the excitement of the crowd, and the orchestra storms to a climax, and the curtain falls, we realize that R & H have not only skipped the overture and the opening number but the exposition as well. [...] They have plunged into the story, right into the middle of it, in the most intense first scene any musical ever had.|$|E

500|$|Chris Cottingham of NME {{gave the}} album {{six out of}} ten, saying that [...] "Tinie is most {{definitely}} a star, second only to Dizzee Rascal on the UK scene, perhaps even above him following Dizzee's dismal ‘The Fifth’ album. So perhaps it's no surprise Tinie's brimming with confidence on record number two." [...] However, Cottingham dismissed the quality of some lyrics as [...] "all great fun for him, no doubt, {{but in the past}} he didn’t trade in this lowest common denominator stuff." [...] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave the album three out of five stars, describing the album as [...] "inoffensive grime-pop for the masses that makes all the right moves, but lacks any serious bite." [...] Larry Day of musicOMH gave the album two and half out of five stars, commenting [...] "this is a massive collaborative project. That's probably the reason it's such a chaotic, unwieldy mess." [...] On the other hand, he praised the promotional single [...] "Don't Sell Out", saying [...] "crunchy handclaps and jerky hooks work a kiss of life on the record, and Tempah's lyrics are fascinating to listen to – he compares himself to Othello and nods to everything from the Queen to Celebrity Juice – if utterly misogynistic." [...] Day concluded the review with [...] "Tempah has gone from rapping with a knowing wink or a glint in his eye to unloading a lewd <b>spiel</b> sans wit." ...|$|E

2500|$|Several customs {{have evolved}} from these {{principal}} commemorations. One widespread custom {{to act out}} the story of Purim. The Purim <b>spiel,</b> or Purim play, has its origins in this, although the Purim <b>spiel</b> {{is not limited to}} that subject. Wearing of costumes and masks is also very common. These may be an outgrowth of Purim plays, but there are several theories as to the origin of the custom, most related in some way to the [...] "hidden" [...] nature of the miracles of Purim.|$|E
