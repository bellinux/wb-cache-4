50|$|It is a usual {{although}} not universal convention that <b>schematic</b> <b>drawings</b> are organized {{on the page}} {{from left to right}} and top to bottom in the same sequence as the flow of the main signal or power path. For example, a schematic for a radio receiver might start with the antenna input at the left of the page and end with the loudspeaker at the right. Positive power supply connections for each stage would be shown towards the top of the page, with grounds, negative supplies, or other return paths towards the bottom. <b>Schematic</b> <b>drawings</b> intended for maintenance may have the principal signal paths highlighted to assist in understanding the signal flow through the circuit. More complex devices have multi-page schematics and must rely on cross-reference symbols to show the flow of signals between the different sheets of the drawing.|$|E

50|$|During {{the same}} period, Cecilia Glaisher worked in {{collaboration}} with her husband on a study intended to distinguish different types of snow crystal structure and understand how they were formed. One hundred and fifty-one of her <b>schematic</b> <b>drawings</b> were used to illustrate her husband's paper, On the Severe Weather {{at the beginning of}} the year 1855: and on Snow and Snow Crystals, published by the Meteorological Society. These <b>schematic</b> <b>drawings</b> were based on original sketches made at the Glaishers' window from direct observation of snow crystals seen through magnifying lenses. They show snow crystals 'perfected' and re-drawn to represent classifiable types of structure. In his book, Snow Crystals, Natural and Artificial, Ukichiro Nakaya describes them as the most accurate observations of snow crystals published before the development of photomicrography. They have been used since 1868 by the Royal Microscopical Society as the basis of the design for its seal and emblem.|$|E

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{examined the}} effects of prior knowledge on learning from different compositions of multiple representations in a mobile learning environment on plant leaf morphology for primary school students. Experiment 1 compared the learning effects of a mobile learning environment presenting text and photos of plants on a tablet PC, either in combination with or without real plants in the physical environment. Results indicated that there were no interactions between prior knowledge and experimental condition. Students who learned with tablet PCs only outperformed students who additionally learned with real plants on a comprehension and an application test. In addition, high prior knowledge students outperformed low prior knowledge students on both tests. To investigate whether these effects were caused by the specific characteristics of the combination of photos of real plants and real plants, Experiment 2 compared the differential effects of prior knowledge on learning with the combination of texts, photos and real plants to a combination in which the photos were replaced by <b>schematic</b> hand <b>drawings.</b> Results indicated that both low and high prior knowledge students, who learned with the combination of texts, <b>schematic</b> hand <b>drawings</b> and real plants performed better on a comprehension and an application test. High prior knowledge students performed better on both tests. It is concluded that the number and type of representations used is critical for the effectiveness of mobile learning environments...|$|R

Each iteration is progressively informed by budgets, continuously improving information and the best efficient construction techniques.|$|R
40|$|Four {{experiments}} {{examined the}} effect of visual similarity on immediate memory for order. Experiments 1 and 2 used easily nameable line drawings. Following a sequential presentation in either silent or suppression conditions, participants were presented with the drawings in a new, random order and were required to remember their original serial position. In Experiment 3, participants first learned to associate a verbal label with an abstract matrix pattern. Then they completed an immediate memory task {{in which they had}} to name the matrices aloud during presentation. At recall, the task required remembering either the order of the matrices or the order of their names. In Experiment 4, participants learned to associate nonword labels with <b>schematic</b> line <b>drawings</b> of faces; the phonemic similarity of the verbal labels was also manipulated. All four experiments indicate that the representations supporting performance comprise both verbal and visual features. The results are consistent with a multiattribute encoding view...|$|R
40|$|Tree architecture, {{the growth}} form of woody {{tropical}} plants, from lofty ’pagoda’ trees to low understorey pachycauls, {{has captured the}} imagination of professor and student alike. Previously many attempts had been made to study the growth form of limited plant groups,, but only recently has it been possible to see the wood from the trees {{as a result of the}} excellent work by Hallé & Oldeman (1970). This small book is crammed full with a wealth of information and profusely illustrated with clear <b>schematic</b> line <b>drawings,</b> supplemented here and there with photos of the habit of selected plants. The presentation, the clear style, and the excellent drawings offset any problems one might have with the language. The growth form is analysed into a number of architectural models all of which are illustrated. Numerous lists of examples of each model are given; from necessity the lists mainly contain African and South American species, but many families and genera also occur in Malesia. Recently Hallé has visited New Guinea and has published a short account of a selection of his observations (Hallé, 1974). It is regretted that more extensive lists of Malesian examples of each architectural model were not included in this paper. No new architectural models were found so one can, in principle, interpret the architecture of Malesian trees using the models discussed in his book...|$|R

5000|$|The {{major factor}} in <b>schematic</b> <b>drawings</b> is a {{reduction}} of reality to easy, clear lines. Typical {{is the lack of}} shadows, the geometrical features, and the realistic proportions. Another trait is the often [...] "slow" [...] drawings, with little to no speed-lines, and strokes that are almost completely even. It is also known as the Belgian clean line style or ligne claire. The Adventures of Tintin {{is a good example of}} this. Other works in this style are the early comics of Jijé and the later work from Flemish and Dutch artists like Ever Meulen and Joost Swarte.|$|E
50|$|The Dighton Rock is a 40-ton boulder, {{originally}} {{located in}} the riverbed of the Taunton River at Berkley, Massachusetts (formerly part {{of the town of}} Dighton). The rock is noted for its petroglyphs ("primarily lines, geometric shapes, and <b>schematic</b> <b>drawings</b> of people, along with writing, both verified and not."), carved designs of ancient and uncertain origin, and the controversy about their creators. In 1963, during construction of a coffer dam, state officials removed the rock from the river for preservation. It was installed in a museum in a nearby park, Dighton Rock State Park. In 1980 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).|$|E
5000|$|Five {{tapestries}} {{were displayed}} at the Sazama-Brauer Gallery in Chicago in 1988: Daughters of Auschwitz, 60'x54', 1978; Daughters of the Earth, 81"x53", 1981; Ghetto Child—Stroop Report, 60"x48” 1982; Liberation, 56"x47", 1987; Deportation, 54"x53", 1988. One painting on non-stretched canvas, Parting Lodz, 48"x96", 1987; was included in this exhibit. It had grommets along its edges for mounting. The sixth tapestry, Pogrom, 64" [...] x 48", was not finished until 1989. Rees claims: [...] "Several examinations are required {{to come to terms}} with the piece. Once really seen, its masterful depiction of brutality serves as the culmination of what Nezhnie was trying to accomplish: tapestries that are hard to dismiss." [...] Nezhnie included her cartoons, the <b>schematic</b> line <b>drawings</b> placed behind the weaving surface during production, and preliminary drawings along with the actual tapestries. This offered a very novel viewing experience; with the effect of duplicating her message many times as the viewer circled the gallery. In the book, A Mission in Art: Recent Holocaust Works in America, Vivian Alpert Thompson defines Nezhnie as an [...] "empathizer": [...] "The empathy of the artists who are not survivors is at times so deep that some of them have taken on characteristics normally attributable to survivors…" [...] and, like for survivors, [...] "the creation of these works is not cathartic for the artist… likely because the conditions of evil that their art warns against still exist." ...|$|R
40|$|Explicit {{tests of}} social {{cognition}} have revealed pervasive deficits in schizophrenia. Less {{is known of}} automatic social cognition in schizophrenia. We used a spatial orienting task to investigate automatic shifts of attention cued by another person’s eye gaze in 29 patients and 28 controls. Central photographic images of a face with eyes shifted left or right, or looking straight ahead, preceded targets that appeared left or right of the cue. To examine automatic effects, cue direction was non-predictive of target location. Cue–target intervals were 100, 300, and 800  ms. In non-social control trials, arrows replaced eye-gaze cues. Both groups showed automatic attentional orienting indexed by faster reaction times (RTs) when arrows were congruent with target location across all cue–target intervals. Similar congruency effects were seen for eye-shift cues at 300 and 800  ms intervals, but patients showed significantly larger congruency effects at 800  ms, which were driven by delayed responses to incongruent target locations. At short 100 -ms cue–target intervals, neither group showed faster RTs for congruent than for incongruent eye-shift cues, but patients were significantly slower to detect targets after direct-gaze cues. These findings conflict with previous studies using <b>schematic</b> line <b>drawings</b> of eye-shifts that have found automatic attentional orienting to be reduced in schizophrenia. Instead, our data indicate that patients display abnormalities in responding to gaze direction at various stages of gaze processing—reflected by a stronger preferential capture of attention by another person’s direct eye contact at initial stages of gaze processing and difficulties disengaging from a gazed-at location once shared attention is established. 10 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Location-aware mobile users need to access, query, and visualize, {{geographic}} {{information in a}} wide variety of applications including tourism, navigation, environmental management, and emergency response. Often they also need to communicate information back and forth with other mobile users or with a central agency. Depending upon the task, the user may have to share or switch between different databases or different views of the same database. In this work, we first describe our efforts to create a consistent visualization of different spatial geographic databases consisting of aerial imagery, AutoCAD <b>drawings,</b> <b>schematic</b> diagrams, and street maps. The location of a mobile user is obtained via GPS (Global Positioning System) and visualized synchronously across different visualizations. Our focus then is to support the mobile user in visually accessing and querying the spatial GIS databases. The mobile or the central user can interact with the the database in real-time and communicate the information to each other over wireless networks. The system supports a variety of queries and tasks (”how far”, ”where”, ”closest ” etc.) for many different types of geometric primitives (points, lines, polygons etc.) and objects (buildings, metro stops etc.). The output results can then be unobtrusively and consistently displayed to the user across multiple views of the scene...|$|R

50|$|The {{assumption}} {{that this is}} an unfinished work by Leonardo seems probable, due to the absence of the known existing original or at least full-scale cartoon while numerous copies dating from the late 15th and early 16th centuries are present. Indeed, {{it is hard to imagine}} that the composition has been developed and made into a painting by some other artist on the basis of known to us and mentioned above very small and <b>schematic</b> <b>drawings</b> by Leonardo, and that later this painting would be repeatedly copied by the artists of Leonardo's circle. The version of the unfinished painting by Leonardo is particularly viable in view of the master’s well-known habit of either leaving his works set aside for many years or completely unfinished.|$|E
40|$|Rattan {{is one of}} Indonesia 2 ̆ 7 s {{wealth and}} has great {{potential}} in the furniture industry. Rattan furniture processed in many small villages, such as in Central Java, there are some villages which cultivate cane then distributed to big cities like Semarang. But in selling the products, rattans are still in a conventional manner that is selling goods on the street, making rattan image decreases. It is necessary for facilities to accommodate the rattan products. One {{of them is a}} showroom facility. In Semarang, there is a showroom that sells rattan products, namely “Istana Rotan”. But this showroom has many shortcomings. So that in this interior design, the designer want to redesign the “Istana Rotan” furniture showroom which is a facility that can accommodate rattan products and raise the image of rattan in Semarang. The redesign process is carried out from doing the survey, data exploration, making the concept, <b>schematic,</b> development, presentation <b>drawings</b> and working drawings, as well as the final results presentation as the model and material schemes. The concept raised is "exposing the locality furniture", where the application is more to the protrusion of the products shown. In addition, the use of local materials such as rattan, wood, brick combined with iron. Implementation of the concept of the design is done on a processing element of the interior showroom furniture “Istana Rotan”. In this scheme also introduced conveyor technology system in displaying rattan products...|$|R
5000|$|In {{defense of}} Haeckel's embryo drawings, the {{principal}} {{argument is that}} of [...] "schematisation." [...] Haeckel's drawings were {{not intended to be}} technical and scientific depictions, but rather <b>schematic</b> <b>drawings</b> and reconstructions for a specifically lay audience. [...] Therefore, as R. Gursch argues, Haeckel's embryo drawings should be regarded as [...] "reconstructions." [...] Although his drawings are open to criticism, his drawings should not be considered falsifications of any sort. Although modern defense of Haeckel's embryo drawings still considers the inaccuracy of his drawings, charges of fraud are considered unreasonable. As Erland Nordenskiöld argues, charges of fraud against Haeckel are unnecessary. R.
