The sensors were referenced to a measurement of absolute temperature {{at the base}} of the mast. A pressure sensor built by Finnish Meteorological Institute is located in the Payload Electronics Box, which sits on the surface of the deck, and houses the acquisition electronics for the MET payload. The Pressure and Temperature sensors commenced operations on Sol 0 (May 26, 2008) and operate continuously, sampling once every 2 seconds.|$|E
25|$|Droops {{function}} with other high-lift devices on an aircraft {{to increase the}} camber of the wing and reduce the stalling speed. On the Airbus A380, {{the first stage of}} lift device selection deploys the droops (called droop noses by Airbus) and leading-edge slats located further out on the wing; with the flaps starting to extend when the second stage is selected. The droops on the A380 may be deployed to a position 22 or 25 degrees lower than their <b>stowed</b> <b>position.</b> Another function of the droops on the A380 is to change the stall characteristics of the wing. The A380's designers found that the airflow between the engines was separating from the wing surface prior to the airflow between the engine and the fuselage, an undesirable characteristic. Adding a droop between the engine and the fuselage fixed the problem; whereas using a leading-edge slat would not have done so because of the gap (or slot) created between a slat and the wing when a slat is deployed.|$|E
500|$|Soon after {{reaching}} , the fighter's DME (radio) showed MCAS El Toro was [...] away. The pilot of '458' then performed an aileron roll, a flight maneuver that rolled the aircraft 360° {{in order to}} allow the pilot to observe any air traffic above or below the aircraft. Lt. Schiess, the Radar Intercept Officer, was operating the fighter's radar, which was unable to detect any aircraft due to its deteriorated condition. Because of the <b>stowed</b> <b>position</b> of the scope, he had been leaning forward and looking downward at the instrument. Between three and ten seconds prior to the collision, he glanced up and observed the DC-9 in his peripheral vision and shouted a warning to the pilot.

500|$|As a {{production}} series B-36 was unavailable, all XF-85 flight tests {{were carried out}} using a converted EB-29B Superfortress mother ship that had a modified, [...] "cutaway" [...] bomb bay complete with trapeze, front airflow deflector {{and an array of}} camera equipment and instrumentation. Since the EB-29B, named Monstro, was smaller than the B-36, the XF-85 would be flight tested, half-exposed. In order to carry the XF-85, a special [...] "loading pit" [...] was dug into the tarmac at South Base, Muroc Field, where all the flight tests originated. On 23July 1948, the XF-85 flew the first of five captive flights, designed to test whether the EB-29B and its parasite fighter could fly [...] "mated". The XF-85 was carried in a <b>stowed</b> <b>position,</b> but was sometimes tethered and extended into the airstream with the engine off, for the pilot to gain some feel for the aircraft in flight.|$|E

40|$|Wind loads on heliostats {{are usually}} {{determined}} at boundary layer, low-speed wind tunnels {{at which the}} design full-scale Reynolds number cannot be reached. In doing so, it is supposed the wind load coefficients are Reynolds number independent, which {{is known to be}} the case for sharp edged bodies. But for the <b>stow</b> <b>position</b> the usually round torque tube is directly exposed to the wind and could influence the wind loads. By measurements in a high-pressure wind tunnel, it can be demonstrated that the design-relevant wind load coefficients are not Reynolds number dependent.

40|$|We {{report the}} past two years of {{collaboration}} between the different actors on the ALMA nutator. Building on previous developments, the nutator has seen changes in much of the design. A high-modulus carbon fiber structure has been added {{on the back of the}} mirror in order to transfer the voice coils forces with less deformation, thus reducing delay problems due to flexing. The controller is now an off-the-shelf National Instrument NI-cRIO, and the amplifier a class D servo drive from Advanced Motion Controls, with high peak power able to drive the coils at 300 Volts DC. The stow mechanism has been totally redesigned to improve on the repeatability and precision of the <b>stow</b> <b>position,</b> which is also the reference for the 26 bits Heidenhain encoders. This also improves on the accuracy of the <b>stow</b> <b>position</b> with wind loading. Finally, the software, written largely with National Instrument's LabView, has been developed. We will discuss these changes and the preliminary performances achieved to date. Keywords: ALMA, nutator, class D, high-modulus carbon fiber. Comment: Published: 23 August 2012; 12 page...|$|R

The Kornet is similar in {{function}} to the Khrizantema missile system. The 9P163M-1 carries two 9M133 missiles on launch rails, which are extended from a <b>stowed</b> <b>position</b> during transit. Missiles are re-loaded automatically by the tank destroyer from an internal magazine with 16 rounds (missiles are stored and transported in sealed canisters). Nuclear, biological and chemical protection is provided for the two crew members (gunner and driver) in addition to full armour protection equivalent to the standard BMP-3 chassis. The guidance system of the 9P163M-1 allows two missiles to be fired at once, the missiles operating on different guidance (laser) channels. The first Kornet-T missile carriers were delivered in 2003 to replace the Shturm-S, and the first batch of 20 vehicles entered service in 2012. The Kornet-T is used by motorized units.|$|E
2500|$|On February 10, 2013, {{while the}} ship was docked in Santa Cruz de la Palma in the Canary Islands, five crew members were killed and three others injured during a safety drill when the {{lifeboat}} they were in fell into the sea, trapping the occupants.

2500|$|A team of divers {{investigated}} Vandal in August 2003, {{looking for}} an explanation for her mysterious sinking. [...] They found a large section (about 4ft) of the stern was missing and the aft engine room escape hatch was closed, but the forward escape hatch was open. [...] In addition, the mooring lines were neatly stowed around both amidships and stern bollards, and the forward hydroplanes were in their <b>stowed</b> <b>position.</b> [...] It is therefore likely that Vandal was on the surface when the incident occurred. [...] The area that Vandal lies in is known as area [...] "Quebec", and was used by submarines performing log calibrations over a [...] "measured mile." [...] So {{it is possible that}} log calibration work was being carried out, and although there are other explanations, this might suggest why she only travelled two miles [...] (4km) in one-and-a-half hours. Maintenance of the log on a submarine can be very hazardous as raising it for inspection can potentially breach the pressure hull and cause a serious flood. In the case of HMS Untamed (which sank three months after Vandal) incorrect procedure whilst carrying out log maintenance was the main contributing factor to the boat and her entire crew being lost. [...] Had the hull been breached, whilst the forward escape hatch was open, the inrush of water could have overwhelmed the submarine. [...] The starboard propeller blades were found to be worn down at their tips, indicating that either the propellers were turning (perhaps full astern) as Vandal hit the seabed, or whilst she was on the seabed in an attempt to drive her off the bottom.|$|E

They are then not adjusted significantly while sailing until the sail is to be handed (put away) again. The lowest sails, the courses, are trimmed using the sheets as these sails are loose footed and are secured to yards only at the head.|$|R
2500|$|The SMLE {{design was}} a {{relatively}} expensive long arm to manufacture, because of the many forging and machining operations required. In the 1920s, a series of experiments resulting in design changes were carried out to help with these problems, {{reducing the number of}} complex parts and refining manufacturing processes. The SMLE Mk V (later Rifle No. 1 Mk V), adopted a new receiver-mounted aperture sighting system, which moved the rear sight from its former position on the barrel. The increased gap resulted in an improved sighting radius, improving sighting accuracy and the aperture improved speed of sighting over various distances. In the <b>stowed</b> <b>position,</b> a fixed distance aperture battle sight calibrated for [...] protruded saving further precious seconds when laying the sight to a target. An alternative developed during this period was to be used on the No. 4 variant, a [...] "battle sight" [...] was developed that allowed for two set distances of 300 yards and 600 yards to be quickly deployed and was cheaper to produce than the [...] "ladder sight". The magazine cutoff was also reintroduced and an additional band was added near the muzzle for additional strength during bayonet use. The design was found to be even more complicated and expensive to manufacture than the Mk III and was not developed or issued, beyond a trial production of about 20,000 rifles between 1922 and 1924 at RSAF Enfield. The No. 1 Mk VI also introduced a heavier [...] "floating barrel" [...] that was independent of the forearm, allowing the barrel to expand and contract without contacting the forearm and interfering with the 'zero', the correlation between the alignment of the barrel and the sights. The floating barrel increased the accuracy of the rifle by allowing it to vibrate freely and consistently, whereas wooden forends in contact with barrels, if not properly fitted, affected the harmonic vibrations of the barrel. The receiver-mounted rear sights and magazine cutoff were also present and 1,025 units were produced between 1930 and 1933.|$|E

40|$|A design {{requirement}} of a heliostat {{is the ability}} to withstand storm loads in the <b>stow</b> <b>position</b> and operational wind loads in any position. To design a heliostat, therefore, one must be able to predict the wind loading on the heliostat for all elevation angles of the heliostat and all wind directions relative to the heliostat coordinate system. Fortunately, experimental wind tunnel force and moment coefficient data in the x, y and z directions exist in tabular format for an isolated heliostat, and are in the public domain, but still require interpolation between different points in a large dataset. This paper shows that the data points fit definable patterns, allowing the use of Fourier analysis to fit a small number of correlations to describe the entire dataset to high accuracy. Correlations for the lift and drag forces are presented. A companion paper presents correlations for the side forces and correlations for moments about the three principal axes, and discusses the behavior of the correlations...|$|R

40|$|At SolarPACES 2012 conference a new {{heliostat}} {{concept was}} presented. It {{is equipped with}} wireless communication, sandwich facets, wind protection devices for wind load reduction, rim drives with winch wheels and ground anchor foundation. Crucial {{for the development of}} the light-weight structures is the precise determination of the maximum loads. By full scale wind load measurements the duration of the peak loads could be determined. They are caused by gusts with such short duration that their energy can be dissipated by shock absorbers protecting the structure. Furthermore, the wind loads can be reduced by wind protection devices. For the design-relevant <b>stow</b> <b>position,</b> a reduction in structural loading of 40 % can be achieved by the wind protection devices as wind tunnel tests have shown. The reduced loading has a significant impact on the dimensioning and cost of the structure and foundation of the heliostat.

50|$|At AUVSI 2012, Lockheed Martin spoke {{openly about}} their status on the project. AAI Corporation was silent about their {{involvement}} details, but confirmed {{they were still}} in the competition. At the time of expo, neither company had prototype vehicles, but had designs and scale models of their concept vehicles. Previously, both passed DARPA's preliminary design review, which involved computer modeling. Lockheed's vehicle relied on two huge turbo-shaft fans and folding wings fixed to a turret above the cab to provide lift and thrust during flight. A key component is computerized flight. Because it will be used by soldiers rather than trained pilots, vehicle operation will be mostly automated. One idea is to have a computer screen to simply plot GPS points to chart a flight path. The fans rotate 90 degrees on the turret from their <b>stowed</b> <b>positions</b> just in front of and behind the cab to their in-flight positions on both sides of it. Control of takeoff, landing, and flight is controlled by the computer, although soldiers onboard would be able to alter their course or perform an emergency landing. The automated flight technology will be similar to the kind used by the F-35 Lightning II. The lift fans of Lockheed's vehicle provide hover while AAI's did not. AAI's vehicle could be made lighter, which gave greater ability to up-armor.|$|R
40|$|Reliable and {{cost-effective}} heliostats with high accuracy are {{a prerequisite for}} the successful market introduction of solar tower systems. The advantages of hydraulic drives are high positioning precision, no backlash, ability to go to <b>stow</b> <b>position</b> at electrical power loss and optional overload protection. Initial cost calculations indicated that a cost-competitive solution could be provided. The design of a heliostat with 30 m² mirror area is described. The oil reservoir with pump, the valve bloc and the cylinders for the azimuth drive {{are located in the}} cross bar. The results of wind tunnel measurements with heliostat models of various aspect ratios led to an aspect ratio of 1. 2. A wind fence was not assumed because in the rear part of usual heliostat fields it has no significant advantage as wind tunnel measurements showed.
