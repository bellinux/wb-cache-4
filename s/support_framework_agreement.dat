40|$|Context of this research: The {{construction}} industry {{has a history}} of client dissatisfaction in the UK. In response, <b>framework</b> <b>agreements</b> have been developed to create relationships between suppliers and clients in order to improve project performance. This research aims to assess whether use of <b>framework</b> <b>agreements</b> can result in significant improvement for performance outcomes without a significant increase in costs when compared with traditional discrete methods, and if so, develop a procurement performance model for realisation and continuous improvement in performance. Research methodology: A literal review of UK Government reports with economic and performance management theories precede a case study set within Hampshire County Council, a major public sector authority, allowing analysis of data from 164 highway maintenance projects by independent samples t-tests. Projects are divided into discrete and framework groups using critical success factors to measure performance differences. In addition to project outcomes, a review of economic performance was undertaken to advance a current ‘gap in professional knowledge’ concerning cost effectiveness of <b>framework</b> <b>agreements.</b> A performance management model is proposed representing impact of operational measures and sociological behaviour factors on suppliers’ performance, tested by qualitative views of experienced practitioners collected through a questionnaire survey and in-depth interviews. Key findings: Independent-samples t-tests proved that there were significant improvements in performance with use of <b>framework</b> <b>agreements,</b> but that no significant additional costs were incurred. Factor analysis and central tendency statistics from questionnaires and node values from interview transcripts confirmed long-term relationships, financial and non–financial incentives and stronger communication were sociological behaviour factors driving performance for <b>framework</b> <b>agreements.</b> Conclusions from the evidence and findings: As <b>framework</b> <b>agreements</b> can achieve significant performance improvements without a significant increase in costs, this study <b>supports</b> use of <b>framework</b> <b>agreements</b> for Hampshire County Council and professional practice. Value of this research is recognised by both central government and case study organisation alike. In respect of the latter context, case study findings have been included within a regional framework for use by South East authorities until 2016. It is recommended further studies should be conducted on civil and building projects in wider public and private sectors so that construction clients can make informed decisions based upon generalised findings...|$|R

The main purpose of this master thesis is to undertake a comprehensive analysis of the provisions of <b>framework</b> <b>agreements</b> in the field of public procurement. The master thesis is based on the current provision of the Act No. 137 / 2006 Coll., on Public Procurements and is divided into five chapters. Chapter one deals with the adaptation of <b>framework</b> <b>agreements</b> in the legislation both in the Czech Republic and in the European Union and as well with the development of this legislation. Chapter two focuses on the basic principles and concepts of the Act No. 137 / 2006 Coll., on Public Procurements which are relevant for the topic of this master thesis. The first part of this chapter defines the basic principles contained in the Act and the in the legislation of the European Union. The second part of this chapter then presents basic information about the most important institutes of the Act. The third chapter deals with {{the first phase of the}} awarding of public contracts with the use of the <b>framework</b> <b>agreement,</b> thus concluding the <b>framework</b> <b>agreement</b> and also in the conduct of the procurement procedure [...] . ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to examine the}} nature of <b>framework</b> <b>agreements</b> in public {{procurement}} in Sweden. The main question is whether a contracting authority is obligated to place orders under a <b>framework</b> <b>agreement</b> when purchasing a product or service that is covered in that agreement and to what extent a contractor is obligated to accept such orders. If the answer to that first question is that an obligation does exist the next question to arise is what kind of consequences to expect when either party fails to meet that obligation. Of great importance is whether a contracting authority that hasn’t used an existing <b>framework</b> <b>agreement</b> is liable to pay damages to the contractor who according to the agreement had a right to deliver. A summary of the results is that the answers to all of the questions depend on what type of <b>framework</b> <b>agreement</b> that is used, whether it’s a contract that has one or several contractors and if all the terms for future contracts are specified. <b>Framework</b> <b>agreements</b> with only one contractor and where all the terms for future contracts have been established are very similar to normal public contracts, which means that it would make sense to use the same set of rules. In this case it’s therefore likely that both parties are obligated by the <b>framework</b> <b>agreement</b> and that failure to live up to these obligations can result in liability. A <b>framework</b> <b>agreement</b> with several contractors where all the terms are not established and where contracts are awarded only after a renewed evaluation of tenders is on the other hand quite different from a public contract. One should therefore not be surprised to find that other rules may apply. Unfortunately I have been unable to give definitive answers to most questions because the available sources are too limited. This thesis is therefore a call to the legislator to clarify and also a call for the increased understanding of, and improved statistics regarding, <b>framework</b> <b>agreements</b> that is necessary to improve public procurement...|$|R

Common price setting strategies such as auctions, <b>framework</b> <b>agreements</b> and spot markets may be of help. To administer a long term stability for an operator, <b>framework</b> <b>agreements</b> can be entered. These <b>framework</b> <b>agreements</b> should be valid for several years but still not consume too much capacity from other operators.
