The meeting was held the {{following}} day in Kosovska Mitrovica, and also included representatives of the Muslim and Albanian communities of Kosovska Mitrovica, Vučitrn, Podujevo, Pristina, Peć, Istok and Drenica. The 60 delegates at the meeting were addressed by {{the commander of the}} German 60th Infantry Division Generalleutnant Friedrich-Georg Eberhardt, who told the assembly that the Germans had liberated the Albanians from the Serbs, and that he was now inviting the Albanians to take over the administration of the Kosovo region. He also said that during his division's advance from Skopje (the capital of modern-day Macedonia) to Kosovska Mitrovica they had seen that the Serb Chetniks had killed 3,000 Albanians. He stated that the Kosovo region would be part of the German-occupied territory of Serbia, under a German-dominated government in Belgrade. This statement was received in stony silence. Eberhardt then told the group that all Serbs in the Kosovo area would eventually be resettled in Serbia, and Kosovo would then contain only Albanians, Muslims and Catholics. The meeting then discussed the situation, and decided that the former Yugoslav <b>structures</b> <b>and</b> <b>authorities</b> in the region would be disarmed and dismantled, and that all Serb officials would be dismissed.|$|E
40|$|Myanmar was {{not only}} a ‘fragile state’ by most {{definitions}} during the 1990 s and 2000 s, but was concurrently isolated as an international ‘pariah’. The complexity of this paradoxical combination of poverty, fragility, pro-economic growth polity and international isolation created an enigmatic context for international agencies, and one in which existing frameworks for development in ‘fragile states’ do not appear overly relevant. Nonetheless, Myanmar experienced a surprising level of development activity, with equally surprising signs of effectiveness. This paper explores this activity, identifying actors, roles, approaches, and modalities of interaction with <b>structures</b> <b>and</b> <b>authorities</b> found to be most effective. The paper is divided into four sections, offering an overview of the historical context, summarising field observations, considering the effectiveness of interventions, and discussing these observations in the light of fragile state policy...|$|E
40|$|The {{cultural}} role of Allen Ginsberg {{does not}} fit a typical Weberian model of charisma. The avant-garde poet was an outstanding personality and possessed an unusual ability to affect people. He played {{a vital role in}} expanding the boundaries of personal freedom in America of the 1950 s– 1990 s, blazing new paths for spiritual, communal and artistic expression. Serving as a father figure for the counterculture—a symbol of an alternative set of cultural norms, lifestyles and literary forms—Ginsberg was a charismatic counter-leader, with no clearly defined followers or movement. As a leader in a more liberated era, he offered energy, ideas, inspiration, and color, but no structure or authority. Instead he was a prophet of freedom, calling on people to express themselves openly, to expand and experiment. This role demanded charisma but of a different kind—one that was more spiritual and less organizational or hierarchical. This article follows Gary Dickson’s essay “Charisma, Medieval and Modern,” in offering a suggestive analysis of and supplement to Weber’s understanding of charisma. The article grapples with the concept of charisma in relation to a generation that resented rigid <b>structures</b> <b>and</b> <b>authorities...</b>|$|E

The scientific novelty of this study {{lies in the fact that}} this is the first comprehensive study in regional historical scholarship, in which social and political life of the population of the Soviet province, studied the socio–political, socio–political, mass–political mood of residents of the Astrakhan region, identify the most important factors influencing the formation of such attitudes. For the first time in regional history, literature has attempted to define the political and social climate. Scientific novelty of the work lies in the fact that in the scientific revolution introduced a significant number of archival documents from the funds of the regional and departmental archives. Thus, it was possible to trace the dynamics of socio–political and socio–political attitudes of different groups of inhabitants of the Astrakhan region. The practical significance of this work lies in the possibility of using the results of power <b>structures</b> <b>and</b> <b>authorities</b> of the Astrakhan region, political parties and public organizations in the formation of stable socio–political attitudes of the population of the region. The study materials can be used for the preparation of the synthesis work on the history of the region, textbooks, courses of lectures for institutions of secondary and higher professional education...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MEd (Curriculum Studies)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. This {{investigation}} {{reports on}} the extent to which teachers became curriculum developers while participating in a collaborative research project with a university based researcher as facilitator. The aim of this study was to examine teacher’s interaction with learning support materials, fostered by a process of professional development, to gain insight into their potential to engage in the activity of curriculum development. To support this whole process, the research strategy of Action Research was employed. Teachers were introduced to the learning support materials during initial workshops, and links were established with the RNCS and the three learning outcomes for the learning area of Natural Science. They were then requested to draft a lesson plan, and following the implementation of the materials, observation of the teachers engaging with the materials, and a process of reflection, they were once again requested to re-draft the initial lesson plan. Three frameworks for analysis, situated within the interpretive paradigm, were employed to ascertain to which extent both professional and curriculum development was evident at the conclusion of the program. The analytical framework used to ascertain the measure of professional development was the model proposed by Bell and Gilbert (1994), consisting of three aspects namely, personal, professional and social development. The two frameworks employed for the analysis of possible curriculum development were firstly, a model adapted from the research by Boomer (1992) consisting of five stages for mapping the curriculum, and secondly the model proposed by Remillard (1999) that includes three arenas of curriculum development, namely curriculum design, construction and mapping. The conclusions of this investigation were that teachers partially engaged with the activity of curriculum development, and that a certain measure of professional development was achieved by the participating teachers. Recommendations for further research was that a more sustainable effort over a longer period of time constituting the aspects of action research, and even added different learning support materials should be engaged in. Also that could be conducted on a larger scale involving more schools, and also closer links to be established with the educational <b>structures</b> <b>and</b> <b>authorities...</b>|$|E
40|$|Gendered Interests and the European Union. The European Women’s Lobby and the Organisation and Representation of Women's Interests. On {{a general}} level this thesis {{concerns}} the changed and changing institutional conditions for gender equality in Europe and the organisation and institutionalisation of women’s {{social and political}} interests at the EU level. I ask in what ways political <b>structures</b> <b>and</b> <b>authorities</b> enable and/or obstruct women to generate, sustain and control their presence in politics as women. I explore how the EU institutions structure and provide opportunities and constraints for women to mobilise and organise {{to act as an}} authorised party vis-a-vis and within the EU political system. How does it come that women, as a collective, are not only recognised as a politically relevant group but also legitimised to act and be present as women in an organised relationship with the EU system’s main authorities? The presence {{comes in the form of}} the European Women’s Lobby (EWL), an EU level and EU wide non-governmental umbrella organisation which represents some 4000 women’s organisations on multiple levels of the EU. The EWL is not the first example of women organising on the EU level, but it is the first of its kind. The EWL was initiated by women from within the European Commission and is funded mainly via a grant from the Commission. The EWL’s objectives include the endorsement of equality between women and men and to ensure that measures to promote gender equality and women’s rights are taken into account and mainstreamed in all EU policy. Using material gathered through interviews, observations and official documentation I study the structure of the European Women’s Lobby; the participation of the EWL in EU politics; the relation between the EWL and the EU institutions; the relation between the EWL’s member organisations; and the forms the representation of women’s organised social and political interests at EU level can take. I argue that in the specific political system of the EU, organised interests in civil society and the EWL perform the functions of input, and participate in output and feedback. Organised interests function as intermediaries between the national and European levels. Organised interests strive to gain influence; the Commission, as a political authority, strives to gain legitimacy of its policy-making through the input and output of representative organised interests. As a consequence of what I argue is a corporatist policymaking style of the Commission the EWL has become increasingly institutionalised. The trade off is that while the EWL has enjoyed the Commission’s support and funding to constitute an established EU level platform from which women can formulate, mobilise and pursue their interests, the EWL has must organise and take control over the interests aggregated from its member organisations and over the form of the member organisations. The very structure of the EWL can be seen as part of the price the EWL has to pay to be granted somewhat of a representative monopoly in terms of opportunities to influence EU policy-making through the various channels of consultation. In this context, I argue that the representativeness of organised interests is key. There is no electoral basis legitimising the policy-making of the Commission, instead, this basis is constituted by organised interests. Paradoxically, this holds the potential for increasing the legitimacy of the Commission, something which increasing transparency has failed to do. It is no exaggeration to claim that the EWL offers a remarkable EU level platform for women to act and pursue their interests as women. By studying the actual impact of EU level policy-making and politics on various ways, this thesis argues that the very existence of the EWL can be understood as being in the interest of women...|$|E

40|$|Increasingly, {{workflow}} systems need {{to operate}} in dynamic environments where {{they are expected to}} ensure that users are supported in performing flexible and creative tasks while maintaining organisational norms.

We support this argument by identifying a number of decision points that an adaptive workflow system must support, discussing how these decisions can be supported with technically oriented capability specifications, and describe how this support can be enhanced with the inclusion of knowledge about organisational <b>structure</b> <b>and</b> <b>authority.</b> We outline how such knowledge can be captured, <b>structured,</b> <b>and</b> represented in a workflow system.
