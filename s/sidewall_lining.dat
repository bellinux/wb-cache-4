5000|$|The first tunnel is at 5 km from Hunedoara, it is a 747 m long {{straight}} tunnel. The {{construction of}} this tunnel started in 1888 and lasted 12 years. The tunnel {{was designed by}} two Italian engineer brothers. The digging of the tunnel was started by two teams {{on both sides of}} the mountain and meeting in the middle in 1894. The finishing work lasted another 6 years till the line opening in 1900. The tunnel is passing through solid limestone uniting Zlaşti valley to Govăjdia valley, with a maximum incline of 27‰ from Zlaşti. The entrances and some sections of the tunnel's inside were lined with stone, other sections had the <b>sidewalls</b> <b>lined</b> with concrete with the ceilings lined with brick. Some sections of the tunnel have bare rock walls where reinforcement wasn't necessary. There are sections in the tunnel where groundwater is seeping in. Inside the tunnel at every 50 metres in the left wall they've constructed s for people caught in the tunnel when the train was coming. [...] A local company removed and scrapped the tracks after 2001. Today the tunnel is in excellent condition, it is open and can be traversed by bicycle, on foot or by motorized all-terrain vehicles serving as a shortcut from Hunedoara to Govăjdia.|$|R

The trench structures {{used in the study}} consisted of n-silicon/undoped trench/n-silicon. The trenches were filled with undoped polycrystalline silicon and the trench <b>sidewall</b> was <b>lined</b> with thermal oxide and a deposited silicon nitride. The capacitance–voltage characteristics across the trench were measured and compared against the model predictions. The circuit model includes the effect of the space-charge region and recombination–generation currents in the undoped polycrystalline silicon trench fill material. The Terman method was used to extract the silicon/oxide sidewall interface density and the mid gap value was found to be less than 10210 #/cm 2 -eV. q 200...|$|R
40|$|State {{of the art}} MOSFET {{performance}} {{is limited by the}} electronic properties of the material that is being used, silicon (Si). In order to continue performance enhancements, different materials are being studied for the extension of Si CMOS. One of the materials of interest, particularly for p-MOSFETs, is Ge because it has very high intrinsic hole mobility. Further improvements in hole mobility can be achieved by straining the material. At the same time it is important to study strained Ge transport in device architectures such as trigate MOSFETs. These devices offer the potential for better scalability than planar MOSFETs via improved electrostatics. The investigation of hole mobility in strained Ge trigate ("nanowire") p- MOSFETs is the focus of this work. To study the effects of strain on Ge as a p-channel material, Strained Germanium Directly on Insulator (SGDOI) substrates were fabricated. The substrates were strained to ~ 2. 4 % using lattice mismatch which originates from the growth of Ge on a relaxed Si₀. ₆Ge₀. ₄ epitaxial layer. A biaxially strained SGDOI substrate was patterned to form Ge nanowires which were measured by Raman spectroscopy to investigate the strain relaxation from the free surface. Another SGDOI substrate was used for nanowire trigate p-MOSFET fabrication. The semiconductor layer structure for the devices consisted of 10 nm-thick strained-Ge with a 5 nm-thick strained-Si cap. On-chip biaxially strained MOSFETs were compared to asymmetrically strained Ge nanowire devices. Significantly improved mobilities (~ 2 x) were observed for nanowire devices with a width of 49 nm compared to the on-chip biaxially strained Ge controls. These mobilities are ~ 15 x over Si universal hole mobility. The impact of strain on the transport of holes in long channel devices is also studied as a function of nanowire width. Mobility decreased for narrower nanowire MOSFETs, likely associated with increased <b>sidewall</b> <b>line</b> edge roughness scattering in narrow lines. by Winston Chern. Thesis (S. M.)

25|$|Railway arches were deep, curved {{structures}} of brick or concrete, {{set into the}} vertical <b>sidewalls</b> of railway <b>lines,</b> that had been intended originally for commercial depots, etc. The arches were covered usually with wooden or brick screen- or curtain walls, thus giving {{a considerable amount of}} protection against air raids – provided, of course, that railway lines were not the prime target of the attack at the particular time and so being more likely to suffer from direct hits. Each arch could accommodate anything from 60 to 150 or so persons. However, fewer people could find shelter at night as sleeping areas for the occupants took up more of the space available - a limitation applying to any other type of shelter as well. Subways were actual thoroughfares also in the shape of arches, normally allowing passage underneath railway lines.|$|R
40|$|The {{acoustic}} performance of passive or active panel structures is usually tested in sound transmission loss facilities. A reverberant sending room, equipped {{with one or}} a number of independent sound sources, is used to generate a diffuse sound field excitation which acts as a disturbance source on the structure under investigation. The spatial correlation and coherence of such a synthesized non-ideal diffuse-sound-field excitation, however, might deviate significantly from the ideal case. This has consequences for the operation of an active feedforward control system which heavily relies on the acquisition of coherent disturbance source information. This work, therefore, evaluates the spatial correlation and coherence of ideal and non-ideal diffuse sound fields and considers the implications {{on the performance of}} a feedforward control system. The system under consideration is an aircraft-typical double panel system, equipped with an active <b>sidewall</b> panel (<b>lining),</b> which is realized in a transmission loss facility. Experimental results for different numbers of sound sources in the reverberation room are compared to simulation results of a comparable generic double panel system excited by an ideal diffuse sound field. It is shown that the number of statistically independent noise sources acting on the primary structure of the double panel system depends not only on the type of diffuse sound field but also on the sample lengths of the processed signals. The experimental results show that the number of reference sensors required for a defined control performance exhibits an inverse relationship to control filter length...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to characterize Brewer Science EXP 97 O 11 experimental broadband back anti-reflective coating (BARC). This BARC was designed to function at both i-line (365 nm) and g-line (436 urn). The focus of this experiment is to incorporate the BARC process into existing lithography processes at RIT. A “Poor Man’s” DRM was performed on both the BARC as well as Shipley 812 photoresist to determine optimum develop {{time as well as}} optimum bake temperature for the BARC. Once the optimum conditions were found, several wafers were processes through 1 st level lithography using the BARC on a polysilicon layer and subsequently etched. This was done to observe any effects undercutting of the BARC during develop would have on etched features. SEM analysis will be performed to analyze undercutting as well as standing wave effects in the photoresist caused by reflections off the polysilicon during exposure. The optimum bake temperature for the BARC was found to be 1600 C for 45 seconds with an initial bake of 1000 C for 60 seconds. At this temperature, the develop rate was found to be approximately 30 nm/sec. The optimum development time for approximately 900 angstroms of BARC with 1. 2 microns of photoresist was found to be 40 seconds using MF- 351 developer. The optimum exposure energy was found to be 105 mJ/cm 2. SEM analysis showed a significant undercutting effect with a slight over-development of the BARC. This indications a need to tightly control the development parameters. Standing waves were not observed due to a “pitting” effect on the <b>sidewall</b> resist <b>lines...</b>|$|R
40|$|As {{scaling of}} CMOS {{technology}} continues, {{the control of}} parasitic source/drain (S/D) resistance (RSD) is becoming increasingly challenging. In order to control RSD, metallic source/drain MOSFETs have attracted significant attention, due to their low resistivity, abrupt junction and low temperature processing (≤ 700 °C). A key issue is reducing the contact resistance between metal and channel, since small Schottky barrier height (SBH) is needed to outperform doped S/D devices. A promising method to decrease the effective barrier height is dopant segregation (DS). In this work several relevant aspects of Schottky barrier (SB) contacts are investigated, both by simulation and experiment, {{with the goal of}} improving performance and understanding of SB-MOSFET technology:First, measurements of low contact resistivity are challenging, since systematic error correction is needed for extraction. In this thesis, a method is presented to determine the accuracy of extracted contact resistivity due to propagation of random measurement error. Second, using Schottky diodes, the effect of dopant segregation of beryllium (Be), bismuth (Bi), and tellurium (Te) on the SBH of NiSi is demonstrated. Further study of Be is used to analyze the mechanism of Schottky barrier lowering. Third, in order to fabricate short gate length MOSFETs, the sidewall transfer lithography process was optimized for achieving low <b>sidewall</b> roughness <b>lines</b> down to 15 nm. Ultra-thin-body (UTB) and tri-gate SB-MOSFET using PtSi S/D and As DS were demonstrated. A simulation study was conducted showing DS can be modeled by a combination of barrier lowering and doped Si extension. Finally, a new Schottky contact model was implemented in a multi-subband Monte Carlo simulator for the first time, and was used to compare doped-S/D to SB-S/D for a 17 nm gate length double gate MOSFET. The results show that a barrier of ≤ 0. 15 eV is needed to comply with the specifications given by the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS). QC 2011120...|$|R
40|$|Azimuthally varying chevrons (AVC) {{which have}} been uniquely {{tailored}} {{to account for the}} asymmetric propulsion-airframe aeroacoustic interactions have recently shown significant reductions in jet-related community noise at low-speed take-off conditions in scale model tests of coaxial nozzles with high bypass ratio. There were indications that such AVCs may also provide shockcell noise reductions at high cruise speeds. This paper describes the flight test results when one such AVC concept, namely, the T-fan chevrons with enhanced mixing near the pylon, was tested at full-scale on a modern large twin-jet aircraft (777 - 300 ER) with focus on shockcell noise at mid-cruise conditions. Shockcell noise is part of the interior cabin noise at cruise conditions and its reduction is useful from the viewpoint of passenger comfort. Noise reduction at the source, in the exhaust jet, especially, at low frequencies, is beneficial from the perspective of reduced fuselage <b>sidewall</b> acoustic <b>lining.</b> Results are shown in terms of unsteady pressure spectra both on the exterior surface of the fuselage at several axial stations and also microphone arrays placed inside the fuselage aft of the engine. The benefits of T-fan chevrons, with and without conventional chevrons on the core nozzle, are shown for several engine operating conditions at cruise involving supersonic fan stream and subsonic or supersonic core stream. The T-fan AVC alone provides up to 5 dB low-frequency noise reduction on the fuselage exterior skin and up to 2 dB reduction inside the cabin. Addition of core chevrons appears to increase the higher frequency noise. This flight test result with the previous model test observation that the T-fan AVCs have hardly any cruise thrust coefficient loss (< 0. 05 %) make them viable candidates for reducing interior cabin noise in high bypass ratio engines...|$|R
40|$|Non-imaging optical {{critical}} dimension (OCD) techniques have rapidly become a preferred method for measuring nanoscale features in semiconductors. OCD relies upon {{the measurement of}} an optical reflectance signature from a grating target {{as a function of}} angle, wavelength and/or polarization. By comparing the sig-nature with theoretical simulations, parameters of the grating lines such as {{critical dimension}} (CD) linewidth, <b>sidewall</b> angle, and <b>line</b> height can be obtained. Although the method is sensitive and highly repeatable, there are many issues to be addressed before OCD can be considered a traceable metrology. We report on progress towards accurate, traceable measurement, modeling, and analysis of OCD signatures collected on the NIST goniometric optical scatter instrument (GOSI), focusing on recent results from grating targets fabricated using the single-crystal critical dimension reference materials (SCCDRM) process. While we demonstrate good cor-relation between linewidth extracted from OCD and that measured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), we also find systematic deviations between the experimentally obtained optical signatures and best fit theoreti-cal signatures that limit our ability to determine uncertainty in OCD linewidth. We then use the SCCDRM line profile model and a χ 2 goodness-of-fit analysis on simulated signatures to demonstrate the theoretical confi-dence limits for the grating line parameters in the case of normally distributed noise. This analysis shows tha...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} arc-jet tests {{in support of}} the Shuttle Orbiter Boundary Layer Transition flight {{experiment}} was conducted in the Channel Nozzle of the NASA Johnson Space Center Atmospheric Reentry Materials and Structures Facility. The boundary layer trip was a protrusion of a certain height and geometry fabricated as part of a 6 "x 6 " tile insert, a special test article made of the Boeing Rigid Insulation tile material and coated with the Reaction Cured Glass used for the bottom fuselage tiles of the Space Shuttle Orbiter. A total of five such tile inserts were manufactured: four with the 0. 25 -in. trip height, and one with the 0. 35 -in. trip height. The tile inserts were interchangeably installed {{in the center of the}} 24 "x 24 " variable configuration tile array mounted in the 24 "x 24 " test section of the channel nozzle. The objectives of the test series were to demonstrate that the boundary layer trip can safely withstand the Space Shuttle Orbiter flight-like re-entry environments and provide temperature data on the protrusion surface, surfaces of the nearby tiles upstream and downstream of the trip, as well as the bond line between the tiles and the structure. The targeted test environments were defined for the tip of the protrusion, away from the nominal surface of the tile array. The arc jet test conditions were approximated in order to produce the levels of the free stream total enthalpy at the protrusion height similar to those expected in flight. The test articles were instrumented with surface, <b>sidewall</b> and bond <b>line</b> thermocouples. Additionally, Tempilaq temperature-indicating paint was applied to the nominal tiles of the tile array in locations not interfering with the protrusion trip. Five different grades of paint were used that disintegrate at different temperatures between 1500 and 2000 deg F. The intent of using the paint was to gauge the RCG-coated tile surface temperature, as well as determine its usefulness for a flight experiment. This paper provides an overview of the channel nozzle arc jet, test articles and test conditions, as well as the results of the arc-jet tests including the measured temperature response of the test articles, their pre- and post-test surface scans, condition of the thermal paint, and continents on the protrusion tip heating achieved in tests compared to the computational fluid dynamics predictions...|$|R
