5|$|Above the Arctic Circle, {{an extreme}} case is reached {{where there is}} no {{daylight}} at all for part of the year, up to six months at the North Pole itself, a polar night. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is exactly reversed, with the <b>South</b> <b>Pole</b> oriented opposite the direction of the North Pole. Six months later, this pole will experience a midnight sun, a day of 24 hours, again reversing with the <b>South</b> <b>Pole.</b>|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 31 October 1956 that anyone {{set foot on the}} <b>South</b> <b>Pole</b> again; on that day a U.S. Navy group led by Rear Admiral George J. Dufek {{successfully}} landed an aircraft there. The first women to step onto the <b>South</b> <b>Pole</b> were Pam Young, Jean Pearson, Lois Jones, Eileen McSaveney, Kay Lindsay and Terry Tickhill in 1969.|$|E

5|$|In 1928, Smith was {{selected}} as a pilot for the Byrd Antarctic Expedition of 1928–1930 {{from a list of}} over 25,000 pilots. Byrd selected Smith not only for his all-weather experience, but because of the respect he had for Smith's mother after meeting her. Smith flew a three-engined Ford Trimotor plane named the Floyd Bennett (named in Bennett's honor) and headed for the <b>South</b> <b>Pole</b> on August 25, 1928. He logged 70 hours of Antarctic flying during the time he was at the <b>South</b> <b>Pole</b> with Admiral Richard Byrd.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ensuing}} months of winter {{darkness}} Joyce and Wild printed around 30copies of the expedition's book, Aurora Australis, which were sewn and bound using packaging materials. The most important winter's work, however, {{was preparing for}} the following season's major journeys, which were to include attempts on both the <b>South</b> <b>Pole</b> and the South Magnetic Pole. By making his base in McMurdo Sound, Shackleton {{had been able to}} reinstate the Magnetic Pole as an expedition objective. Shackleton himself would be leading the <b>South</b> <b>Pole</b> journey, which had suffered a serious setback during the winter when four of the remaining ponies died, mainly from eating volcanic sand for its salt content.|$|E
5|$|Scott's plans {{gradually}} came to fruition– {{a large-scale}} scientific and geographical expedition with {{the conquest of}} the <b>South</b> <b>Pole</b> as its principal objective. Scott was anxious to avoid the amateurism that had {{been associated with the}} Discovery Expedition's scientific work. He appointed Edward Wilson as his chief scientist, and Wilson selected an experienced team. The expedition set off in June 1910 in Terra Nova, one of Discovery's relief ships. Its programme was complicated by the simultaneous arrival in the Antarctic of Roald Amundsen's Norwegian expedition. Amundsen's party reached the <b>South</b> <b>Pole</b> on 14 December 1911 and returned safely. Scott and four companions, including Wilson, arrived at the Pole on 17 January 1912; all five perished on the return journey.|$|E

5|$|The Antarctic Plateau was claimed for Norway by Roald Amundsen as the King Haakon VII Plateau {{when his}} {{expedition}} {{was the first}} to reach <b>South</b> <b>Pole</b> on 14 December 1911. It was mapped as a circular territory comprising the plateau around the <b>South</b> <b>Pole,</b> including all the land above latitude 85°S. However, roughly the same area had been claimed by the British as the King Edward VII Plateau, which was in conflict with the Norwegian claim. Amundsen's claim has never been officially claimed by the Norwegian government.|$|E

5|$|At {{the edge}} of the continent, strong {{katabatic}} winds off the polar plateau often blow at storm force. In the interior, wind speeds are typically moderate. During clear days in summer, more solar radiation reaches the surface at the <b>South</b> <b>Pole</b> than at the equator because of the 24 hours of sunlight each day at the Pole.|$|E
5|$|Clouds {{typically}} cover 1% of Titan's disk, though outburst {{events have}} been observed in which the cloud cover rapidly expands {{to as much as}} 8%. One hypothesis asserts that the southern clouds are formed when heightened levels of sunlight during the southern summer generate uplift in the atmosphere, resulting in convection. This explanation is {{complicated by the fact that}} cloud formation has been observed not only after the southern summer solstice but also during mid-spring. Increased methane humidity at the <b>south</b> <b>pole</b> possibly contributes to the rapid increases in cloud size. It was summer in Titan's southern hemisphere until 2010, when Saturn's orbit, which governs Titan's motion, moved Titan's northern hemisphere into the sunlight. When the seasons switch, it is expected that ethane will begin to condense over the <b>south</b> <b>pole.</b>|$|E

5|$|Near {{the surface}} of the Earth, its {{magnetic}} field can be closely approximated by the field of a magnetic dipole positioned {{at the center of the}} Earth and tilted at an angle of about 11° with respect to the rotational axis of the Earth. The dipole is roughly equivalent to a powerful bar magnet, with its <b>south</b> <b>pole</b> pointing towards the geomagnetic North Pole. This may seem surprising, but the north pole of a magnet is so defined because, if allowed to rotate freely, it points roughly northward (in the geographic sense). Since the north pole of a magnet attracts the south poles of other magnets and repels the north poles, it must be attracted to the <b>south</b> <b>pole</b> of Earth's magnet. The dipolar field accounts for 80–90% of the field in most locations.|$|E

5|$|The bulk of Jupiter's {{magnetic}} field, like Earth's, {{is generated}} by an internal dynamo supported by the circulation of a conducting fluid in its outer core. But whereas Earth's core is made of molten iron and nickel, Jupiter's is composed of metallic hydrogen. As with Earth's, Jupiter's magnetic field is mostly a dipole, with north and south magnetic poles {{at the ends of}} a single magnetic axis. However, on Jupiter the north pole of the dipole is located in the planet's northern hemisphere and the <b>south</b> <b>pole</b> of the dipole lies in its southern hemisphere, opposite to the Earth, whose north pole lies in the southern hemisphere and <b>south</b> <b>pole</b> lies in the northern hemisphere. Jupiter's field also has quadrupole, octupole and higher components, though they are less than one tenth as strong as the dipole component.|$|E
