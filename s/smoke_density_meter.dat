40|$|The {{animation}} {{of volcanic}} smoke {{is useful for}} natural disaster simulations, entertainments, etc. In this paper, we propose a model to generate realistic animations of the volcanic smoke. The model is designed by taking the eruption magnitude decided by the eruption velocity and the initial volcanic <b>smoke</b> <b>density,</b> the buoyancy generated by {{the difference between the}} volcanic <b>smoke</b> <b>density</b> and the atmospheric density, and the decreasing of the volcanic <b>smoke</b> <b>density</b> due to the loss of the pyroclasts (fragments of magma); i. e., this model is based on the physical dynamics of the volcanic smoke. In this model, the Navier-Stokes equations are used, and we solve the equations by using the method of the Coupled Map Lattice (CML) that is an efficient solver. Hence, in our system, the behavior of the volcanic smoke can be calculated in practical calculation time, and various shapes of the volcanic smoke can be generated by only changing some parameters. Therefore, realistic volcanic smoke animations can be created by our approach efficiently. ...|$|R

The heat release rate and fire reaction properties of thermoset matrix composites reinforced with combustible fibres (aramid, extended-chain polyethylene) or non-combustible fibres (glass, carbon) were determined over a range of heat flux levels using the oxygen consumption cone calorimeter technique. The fire reaction properties that were measured were time-to-ignition, <b>smoke</b> <b>density,</b> carbon monoxide yield, carbon dioxide yield, mass loss rate and total mass loss. It is discovered that these reaction properties (apart from ignition time) are linearly related to the heat release rate for composites containing non-combustible fibres.
