50|$|In June 2006 Ewart offered Simonsbath Barton estate {{for sale}} via estate agents Savills and Strutt & Parker. This estate was built {{originally}} as the home-farm for Simonsbath House, and is situated nearby. The land offered comprised 2,080 acres freehold and a further 3,788 acres rented under a grazing licence from Exmoor National Park expiring in 2031. Also included was a five-bedroom house, another of four bedrooms, {{and a range}} of buildings and cottages. The land was then generating £378,333 per annum in government farming grants and subsidies, whilst further profit was accruing from the farming operations which comprised a 640-head home-bred <b>suckler</b> <b>calf</b> herd and a flock of 2,500 Scotch Blackface ewes. The asking price was £4 1/2 million.|$|E
40|$|The {{results to}} date, from this sire breed {{comparison}} {{study indicate that}} with the contrasting Aberdeen Angus and Charolais sire breeds that is possible to achieve animal performance data comparable to well managed conventional <b>suckler</b> <b>calf</b> to beef systems (300 kg carcass for heifers in Nov and 400 kg carcass for steers in March). Similarly the responses to sire breed type, sex and date of slaughter for the organic beef animals are biologically compatible. Organic beef is produced under organic rules in response to consumer demand for organic product. The organic system contributes {{to the protection of}} the environment and animal welfare. “We have not inherited the world from our forefathers we have borrowed it from our children” (Kashmiri proverb) ...|$|E
40|$|Calfhood {{diseases}} have a {{major impact}} on the economic viability of cattle operations. A three part review series has been developed focusing on calf health from birth to weaning. In this paper, the last of the three part series, we review disease prevention and management with particular reference to pneumonia, focusing primarily on the pre-weaned calf. Pneumonia in recently weaned suckler calves is also considered, where the key risk factors are related to the time of weaning. Weaning of the <b>suckler</b> <b>calf</b> is often combined with additional stressors including a change in nutrition, environmental change, transport and painful husbandry procedures (castration, dehorning). The reduction of the cumulative effects of these multiple stressors around the time of weaning together with vaccination programmes (preconditioning) can reduce subsequent morbidity and mortality in the feedlot. In most studies, calves housed individually and calves housed outdoors with shelter, are associated with decreased risk of disease. Even though it poses greater management challenges, successful group housing of calves is possible. Special emphasis should be given to equal age groups and to keeping groups stable once they are formed. The management of pneumonia in calves is reliant on a sound understanding of aetiology, relevant risk factors, and of effective approaches to diagnosis and treatment. Early signs of pneumonia include increased respiratory rate and fever, followed by depression. The single most important factor determining the success of therapy in calves with pneumonia is early onset of treatment, and subsequent adequate duration of treatment. The efficacy and economical viability of vaccination against respiratory disease in calves remains unclear. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|End {{of project}} reportMost beef and dairy cows are spring calving leading to {{distinct}} seasonality of supply. Calving {{a proportion of}} the beef herd in the autumn {{would lead to a}} more uniform annual supply of cattle for slaughter and potentially increase the proportion of grazed grass in the diet of the suckler progeny. Autumn calving sucklers also facilitate the use of AI, which should enhance the product quality. This project aimed to address the technical aspects of autumn calving sucklers, which differ from those of spring calvers. The currently available international energy models were evaluated for autumn calving lactating suckler cows using the type of cow typically found in Irish suckler herds (Experiment 1). The winter accommodation of the <b>suckler</b> cow and <b>calf</b> unit and its impact on cow reproductive performance was evaluated (Experiment 2). The final part of the project evolved into component studies to determine the effect of supplementary feed on the performance of grazing bulls (Experiment 3), and the consequences of weanling cattle grazing pasture in winter as an alternative to housing them in winter (Experiments 4 to 7) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to synthesise and analyse the methodologies and the biological aspects of the costs calculation in ruminants in Slovakia. According to literature, the account classification of cost items is most often considered for construction of costing formula. The costs are mostly divided into fixed (costs independent from volume of herd’s production) and variable ones (costs connected with improvement of breeding conditions). Cost for feeds and beddings, labour costs, other direct costs and depreciations were found {{as the most important}} cost items in ruminants. It can be assumed that including the depreciations into costs of the basic herd takes into consideration the real costs simultaneously invested into raising of young animals in the given period. Costs are calculated for the unit of the main and by-products and their classification is influenced mainly by the type of livestock and production system. In dairy cows is usually milk defined as the main product, and by- products are live born calf and manure. The base calculation unit is kilogram of milk (basic herd of cows) and kilogram of gain and kilogram of live weight (young breeding cattle). In suckler cows is a live-born calf the main product and manure is the by-product. The costs are mostly calculated per <b>suckler</b> cow, live-born <b>calf</b> and per kilogram of live weight of weaned calf. Similar division of products into main and by-products is also in cost calculation for sheep categories. The difference is that clotted cheese is also considered as the main product of basic herd in dairy sheep and greasy wool as the by-products in all categories. Definition of the base calculation units in sheep categories followed the mentioned classification. The value of a by-product in cattle and sheep is usually set according to its quantity and intra- plant price of the by-product. In the calculation of the costs for sheep and cattle the “structural ewe” and “structural cow” proportionally integrate the costs of other categories of the herd into the costs of the basic herd. Subtraction, allocation and combined calculation methods of costs are the most used in breeding of ruminants. It is recommended to consider specific breeding conditions and objective calculation of costs for the relevant category, when picking out the method of calculation...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to assess {{during the winter}} feeding period the effects of replacing grass silage (G) with whole-crop barley silage (B) or whole-crop oat silage (O) on <b>suckler</b> cow and <b>calf</b> performance. Forty-eight Hereford cows with an initial live weight of 741 kg (S. D. 78. 5) were selected for the experiment. The diet was either G, B or O as a sole feed. The aim was to offer the cows {{the same amount of}} energy in all diets. Therefore, the energy content of the silages was evaluated prior to the experiment by measuring the in vitro organic matter digestibility which resulted in 11. 7 MJ metabolizable energy (ME) /kg dry matter (DM) for G and 9. 9 MJ ME/kg DM for B and O. During the experiment, the digestibility of the silages was measured by both in vitro and in vivo methods. The ME values of G, B and O evaluated by the in vivo method were 11. 2, 10. 5 and 9. 5 MJ/kg DM, respectively. The DM intake on diets G, B and O averaged 9. 2, 10. 5 and 10. 3 kg which resulted in ME intakes of 102, 109 and 97 MJ ME/d, respectively. The type of roughage affected the in vivo apparent protein digestibility co-efficients which for G, B and O were 0. 841, 0. 698 and 0. 498, respectively (G versus B, P < 0. 05; G versus O and B versus O, P < 0. 01). The initial cow body condition score (BCS) averaged 3. 2 (S. D. 0. 23). Pre-grazing the change of BCS and the live weight gain (LWG) for G, B and O cows was on average 0. 23, 0. 09 and - 0. 39 (G versus O and B versus O, P < 0. 001) and - 20, - 9 and - 56 kg (G versus O, P < 0. 05; B versus O, P < 0. 01), respectively. All calves were born before the grazing season and milk and grass were the sole feeds at pasture. The pre-weaning calf LWG was not affected by the diets averaging 1357 g/d. The daily milk yield on diets G, B and O averaged 11. 4, 10. 3 and 9. 5 kg (G versus O, P < 0. 05), respectively. Forty-two out of 48 cows entered the mating period of which all were observed to be pregnant. The interval from calving to conception averaged 89 days. B and O proved to be suitable winter feeds for mature suckler cows in cold winter circumstances. Especially O had a lower energy and protein content than G but fulfilled the energy and protein demands of mature, pregnant beef cows in good body condition. v 2005 o...|$|R
