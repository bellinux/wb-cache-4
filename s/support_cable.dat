In addition traffic on the river below was also halted. In March Nuttall began installing five temporary saddle frames atop the bridge's arch; these allowed the weight of the bridge to be supported without the hangers. This allowed them to replace defective fork connectors at {{the top and bottom of}} each hanger.|$|E

50|$|The ACCAR {{alternative}} to the hemispherical cruising altitude rules, if adopted in 1997, could have eliminated the navigation paradox at all altitudes, and could have saved 342 lives in over 30 midair collisions (up to November 2006) since the Risk Analysis proof that the current regulations multiply midair collision risk {{in direct proportion to}} pilot accuracy in compliance. The Namibian collision in 1997, the Japanese near-miss in 2001, the Überlingen collision in Germany in 2002, and the Amazon collision in 2006, are all examples where human or hardware errors doomed altitude-accurate pilots killed by the navigation paradox designed into the current cruising altitude rules. The current system as described by Paielli noted as examples that nuclear power plants and elevators are designed to be passively safe and fault tolerant. Reactivity control rods fall into the reactor to cause a shutdown on loss of electrical power, and elevator fall-arresting brakes are released by torque from <b>support</b> <b>cable</b> tension. The navigation paradox describes a midair collision safety system that by design cannot tolerate a single failure in human performance or electronic hardware.|$|E
5000|$|Kootenay Lake Crossing was a {{powerline}} {{crossing of}} Kootenay Lake, British Columbia, Canada. The {{idea was to}} move electricity from the Hydro dam on the Kootenay Riverat Brilliant to the Cominco Sullivan Mine at Kimberley. The most direct route was across Kootenay Lake. It was with a span width of 3248 m the longest powerline span of North America and was fixed on two 90 m tall electricity pylons. Roebling cable provided the steel <b>support</b> <b>cable</b> for the conductor. The height of conductor over Kootenay Lake was 37 m.There was a 100 m steel support tower on the east shore, and rock anchored shorter towers {{high up on the}} west shore. Kootenay Lake Crossing was inaugurated in 1958, but was demolished in 1962 by explosives placed by the Sons of Freedom religious sect of the Doukhobors. The tower was rebuilt and the span lengthened in course.

The {{results of this study}} confirm that in general the larger the test vehicle the larger is the flexural frequency measurement error attributable to a given cable suspension configuration. For horizontally oriented beams representing modern aerospace vehicles of average size and flexibility, the restraining effects of all but the shortest <b>support</b> <b>cables</b> were minor. The restraining effects of <b>support</b> <b>cables</b> of moderate length attached near the base of vertically oriented vehicles were overshadowed by the effects of beam compression due to gravity...|$|R

50|$|This last usage is {{particularly}} common, and specifically involves wrapping the whip around a fixed overhead object {{and using the}} body to swing across an open space. While this is theoretically possible, the wrap must exhibit intense strength—enough to hold the user's body weight for the entire leap— but be made of material loose enough to smoothly disengage once the swing is completed. Thus actual use in this fashion is highly impractical; it would require not only a precisely balanced whip relative to the user, {{but also to the}} overhead fixture, which would not only compromise the whip's efficacy for any other use or context but require exceptional contrivance of circumstance. Even granted all of this, the strain of such a swing will damage or break most leather whips. In live-action fiction, the visual effect is achieved by braiding the whip over a steel or kevlar <b>support</b> <b>cable</b> and anchoring the tip permanently to a support such as a crane or scaffolding. In many instances the whip handle is also attached to a concealed body harness on the actor for safety, allowing more dynamic motions to make the swing appear more daring and graceful.|$|E

Oliver attacks Barbara, who flees into the attic. Oliver boards up the house to prevent Barbara from escaping, while Barbara loosens the chandelier to drop on Oliver to kill him. When their housekeeper Susan pays them an unexpected visit during the night, she senses something is terribly wrong and discreetly contacts Gavin for help. By the time Gavin arrives, Oliver and Barbara's quarrel has culminated in the two hanging dangerously from the insecure chandelier.

Dean and Ryan flee from the 'droid along elevated metal catwalks with Zimyanin in pursuit; {{the three of them}} wind up trapped between a fallen section of catwalk and the advancing sec hunter. Ryan negotiates a brief truce with the Major-Commandant, carefully leaving out that the sec hunter is primarily interested him alone. Zimyanin attempts to confront the 'droid head-on, which ends with the robot breaking his right arm. The brief confrontation causes the catwalk to shift and drop slightly, which the robot has difficulty coping with; noticing this, the three deliberately rock the catwalk violently, eventually causing one end of a section to break free and drop. Zimyanin blocks a last-ditch effort by the sec hunter to attack Ryan and forcibly throws it from the catwalk to its destruction, but ends up hanging one-handed from a severed <b>support</b> <b>cable.</b> Despite the risks (and against the oft-repeated advice of the Trader) Ryan moves to help Gregori back onto the catwalk. However, Dean refuses to let him live, taking aim with his pistol at the Major-Commandant. Rather than force the young boy to kill him, Zimyanin deliberately lets go, falling to his death.

5000|$|Some cable providers, {{including}} Comcast and Time Warner Cable, {{have issued}} [...] "family tiers", cable packages exclusively with family-oriented channels, but the PTC criticized such packages as not {{catering to the}} interest of the PTC's constituency, as both [...] "tiers" [...] omitted news and sports channels (such as CNN and ESPN) yet - in the case of Comcast - included such channels that the PTC deemed not [...] "family-friendly", such as TBS for showing reruns of Friends and Sex and the City and USA Network for its reruns of Law & Order: Criminal Intent and Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. Nevertheless, TBS does show programs the PTC has deemed family-friendly or inoffensive, including Major League Baseball coverage, Everybody Loves Raymond, Home Improvement, and The King of Queens, while also broadcasting the PTC-banned programs Dawson's Creek and The Drew Carey Show. In addition, USA Network currently shows PTC-approved programs JAG and Monk. The PTC also criticized Time Warner for many of the same reasons, also claiming that [...] "according to Time Warner, classic movies are not appropriate for families. And neither is religious programming", referring to the omission of channels such as Turner Classic Movies and The Word Network from the package. In January 2006, then-PTC president L.

[...] He later went on to claim that [...] "cable channel choice to America's families ... is the only option available that creates a really free market in the cable industry."
