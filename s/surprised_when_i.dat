500|$|Cambridge boat club {{president}} Mark Horton immediately {{challenged the}} Oxford president Andy Michelmore to a re-row; {{the challenge was}} declined. [...] Horton recalls [...] "It was hard to take and is still a painful memory. [...] The Boat Race {{was supposed to be}} one of the proudest moments of my life". [...] Cambridge's Mark Bathurst was indignant about the preparation of the boat: [...] "we had taken to the water without fitting any [...] – an act of monumental idiocy". [...] Oxford cox Fail told The Guardian [...] "I was <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> heard that Cambridge had sunk. [...] If you keep going steadily you forget about water and ride it out." ...|$|E
500|$|Lydia {{discovered}} Zoe's true intentions for befriending her, {{and set out}} to take revenge. In {{a second}} interview with E4, Lister stated: [...] "I was really <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> learned about Zoe's 'master plan' to get Lydia to confess because I think after everything that Zoe's been through [...] the last thing she wants to do is ever see Lydia again, let alone try and make friends with her! But that is her only way, so I think it's really interesting." [...] She continued: [...] "The fight and the chase stuff with Lydia in the graveyard was really good, we filmed it at night. I was dressed as Madonna. We were in a cemetery, it was brilliant!..." ...|$|E
500|$|Nichols {{was cast}} as Shana [...] "Scarlett" [...] O'Hara in the live-action film {{adaptation}} of the G.I. Joe franchise [...] (2009) in late 2007. She later said that she accepted director Stephen Sommers' offer for the role without having read the actual script. [...] "I'd heard from other people that the script was quite good. And then when I finally got to read it myself... I really, really liked it... I liked {{that there were two}} kick-ass female roles. And I liked the fact that it wasn't just a big action movie... And there was comedy in it. I was genuinely really happily <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> read the script." [...] She put on approximately [...] of muscle for the role and trained in mixed martial arts with co-star Sienna Miller for some of the film's action sequences. Nichols was burned by a flame during the filming of a fight scene with Miller. Like The Amityville Horror, G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra was not well received by most critics, but performed well at the box office. Richard Corliss of Time wrote that Nichols had [...] "an appealing manner and comely biceps" [...] as Scarlett O'Hara and took notice of her [...] "savory girl fight with Sienna Miller, as the mostly villainous Baroness." [...] After G.I. Joe, Nichols' next project was the horror film For Sale by Owner, where she played Anna Farrier. Going straight-to-video on October 27, 2009, the movie went largely unnoticed by critics and audiences alike.|$|E
60|$|I nodded my thanks, and strolled back to Elsie's. Dear little Elsie was in {{transports}} of <b>surprise</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> related my adventure.|$|R

2500|$|Derek Martin {{said he was}} {{surprised}} by the new baby swap storyline when it was published in the media. Speaking on This Morning, Martin commented: [...] "I'm one of those actors – I don't know how many others do it – but when I get the scripts, I only read my bits. So I looked , 'Charlie leaves his grandson upstairs, goes downstairs, gets on the drink, gets drunk – the baby's dead'. So that's terrible guilt obviously – because I feel as though it's my fault that he's died. I was <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> saw the story come out – because I don't read the others' [...] – that it was a baby swap." [...] Discussing the surrounding controversy of the plot, Martin added: [...] "Don't forget, there's millions of people – there's 60 odd million here, and they've all got different opinions. Every subject, everything that comes up… everybody will have opinions about that. So therefore you have to accept that's the public – some are for, some are against, and that's the way it is." [...] He continues: Over the years, don't forget, EastEnders have always had subjects. When [...] brother had raped Kat and we didn't find out until later on, that was a very strong storyline. And when Little Mo was bashed by her husband Trevor. These stories are all part of real life." ...|$|E

60|$|I had instinctively {{taken off}} my round felt {{hat in the}} first moment of <b>surprise,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> found myself {{in the midst of}} this strange throng, and I {{standing}} now in a somewhat embarrassed posture, holding it awkwardly before me like a shield to protect my chest.|$|R
60|$|Scarcely had he {{departed}} on the errand when Bill Quigley, who lay at my feet, {{created a}} diversion. I jumped--yes, and I freely confess that I yelled--with startle and <b>surprise,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> felt his paws clutch my ankles and his teeth shut {{down on the}} calf of my leg.|$|R
60|$|They entered. Heavens! {{what was}} my <b>surprise</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> beheld Bianca before me. It was herself; pale with grief; but still more matured in loveliness than <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had last beheld her. The time that had elapsed had {{developed}} the graces of her person; and the sorrow she had undergone had diffused over her countenance an irresistible tenderness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Caddy," [...] said I, {{turning to}} her, [...] "perhaps {{you will not}} be <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> tell you, my dear, that there never has been any engagement--" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I was {{certainly}} <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{heard that you}} were going so far away," [...] Godfrey said, [...] "as my friends told me that you had property. It seemed almost like going into banishment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{me it is}} {{a matter}} of astonishment that any human being should believe me to have {{committed}} this murder. I am lost in <b>surprise</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> remember that I am here simply because I walked home from my club with a loaded stick in my pocket. The magistrate, I suppose, thought me guilty." ...|$|R
6000|$|Charnock's eyes twinkled. [...] "I expect Sadie {{will bear}} the separation. For one thing, {{we lost our}} crop and she'll save money while I'm away. She's not parsimonious, but she hates to waste dollars, and must have found me {{expensive}} now and then. Then I mean to earn something, and can imagine her <b>surprise</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> show her my wages check." ...|$|R
60|$|This was uttered {{with great}} animation, {{and in a}} way to show that my sister was very much in earnest. <b>I</b> felt some <b>surprise</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> put this feeling in {{connection}} with the landlady's remarks, and began to suspect there might be something behind the curtain worthy of my knowledge. In order to make discoveries, however, it was necessary to pursue the discourse.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing much," [...] John replied. [...] "She seemed <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{mentioned}} your name. I {{asked her}} why, {{and she told}} me, or rather she hinted, that you and the prince are very great friends." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "I can't really {{ever say}} what it will look like or how it will finish or what will make it work. It's a {{different}} idea or moment for each painting. It's not really... I try so much with the composition and colour, and get closer and closer, and then there's always a moment where there's a <b>surprise,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> try something and ... everything is in place." ...|$|R
60|$|When {{she went}} out {{it seemed to me}} that nothing was left, so I crept lonesomely away to the wing hall and sat down by a window to dream of her; and she filled my {{thoughts}} so fully that it was no <b>surprise</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> raised my eyes and saw her coming down the hall alone, her bright head shining against the dark old walls.|$|R
60|$|One {{after another}} the merchants set {{down a few}} lines upon the roll, and when they had all finished, I came forward, and {{snatched}} the paper {{from the man who}} held it.

60|$|I was <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{reached my}} lodging in New Maiden to find no letters for me, save one fat budget from Alice. I knew her squat, saturnine {{handwriting}} on the envelope, and I thought I knew what contents to expect from the letter.|$|E
6000|$|Much to my <b>surprise,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{would have}} clambered aboard the ship, whose rail towered many feet above ours, {{one of the}} sailors leaned far over to give me aid when it was not really needed.

60|$|The woman's <b>surprise</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> inquired {{after her}} {{precious}} son was undoubtedly genuine. Her lamentations and crocodile tears certainly were not. She reeked of alcohol, {{and the one}} room which she inhabited was indescribably filthy. I offered her half a franc if she gave me authentic news of Theodore, knowing well that for that sum she would have sold him to the devil. But very obviously she knew nothing of his whereabouts, and I soon made haste to shake the dirt of her abode from my heels.|$|R
60|$|I was <b>surprised,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{came within}} sight of our office-door, to see the ticket-porters {{standing}} outside talking together, and some half-dozen stragglers gazing at the windows which were shut up.

6000|$|... "I {{hope they}} won't be long," [...] she thought. [...] "I hope the girls come first. I don't want {{to burst into}} {{a room full of}} boys.

6000|$|I was <b>{{surprised}},</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> came to Mr. Barkis's house, to find Ham {{walking up}} and down in front of it, and still more surprised to learn from him that little Em'ly was inside. I naturally inquired why he was not there too, instead of pacing the streets by himself? ...|$|E
500|$|Julie Opipari of Manga Maniac Cafe {{gave the}} initial Gossip Girl manga a {{negative}} review, citing displeasure with {{the characters and}} plot. However, she acknowledged that this gave her a greater appreciation for Blair in the second volume, noting that Blair [...] "really {{had to learn how}} to rough it" [...] after losing her privileged lifestyle. She went on to state that [...] "Blair is one character that is fun to hate on. So imagine my <b>surprise</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> actually started to like her by the end of the book".|$|R
5000|$|According to the game's {{designer}} Lawrence Holland, Chris Roberts {{told him}} at an industry conference {{that he had}} reverse-engineered Battlehawks 1942 to create the game engine for Wing Commander.

Imagine my <b>surprise</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> turned around and saw Steven Spielberg and George Lucas discussing it and learning further that Steven Spielberg was playing and enjoying it. He was an early video game convert." ...|$|R

He took so much abuse, he recalled later, that [...] "I've got a little book in which I've written down {{the names of those}} people who upset me the most. I don't want to name them because I want it to be a <b>surprise</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> get them back." ...|$|R
