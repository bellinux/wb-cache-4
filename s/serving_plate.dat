5000|$|A {{finger bowl}} is {{a bowl of}} water used for rinsing one's fingers after the last course of a formal meal served à la russe. It is {{typically}} brought to {{the table at the}} time of the dessert course, arriving atop the dessert plate, with a linen doily between the plate and the bowl and with the dessert fork and spoon on the plate. If a separate fruit course is to follow dessert, the finger bowl should be brought in at that time, with the fruit fork and knife. Alternatively, a full array of dishes can be brought out at once, with the finger bowl atop the dessert plate with its fork and spoon, and the dessert plate atop the fruit plate, with doilies between each dish; in this type of service, the fruit fork and knife are brought out after the dessert plates and silver are cleared. [...] "Where there are plenty of servants, the finger bowl may not come in on the fruit plate but may be brought on its own <b>serving</b> <b>plate,</b> replacing the used fruit plate before the guests leave the table for coffee." [...] A glass ornament, flower, flower petals, lemon slice, sprig of mint or other decoration is often floated in it.|$|E

40|$|The brief was {{to produce}} a range of {{affordable}} and functional products for everyday use. Research undertaken {{in response to the}} brief significantly addressed the needs of the consumer. The range was designed so that it could be manufactured across a number of factories: Greece, Spain, Portugal, Poland, Vietnam and China, thus, allowing the volumes to be achieved without completely overrunning one factory with one range. The designing of each article considered the most effective production method. Also stacking of each product was a necessary part of the design brief, this facilitates ease of storage and transportation. Stacking of objects is particularly challenging but necessary for economic and environmental policies. The range also offers the same design in a number of materials: stoneware, earthenware, and glass and a number of glaze and/or glass colours and patterns. This provides different price points and also a variety of aesthetics and consumer choice. The overall aesthetic is clean-cut, which provides simplicity and easy accessibility for the consumer but also a plain surface for the addition of pattern. A workshop with Kevin Gould, the chef, food critic and food trend analyst, enabled design teams to assess current food trends helpful to designing products appropriate to the food customers are buying. Research showed that although traditional and cultural dishes remained a mainstay in consumers’ eating habits, there was a predominant demand for pasta, pizza, rice and noodle dishes particularly Indian and Thai curry. Consumers were also seeking tableware to reflect the trans-cultural character of these dishes: large 30 cm flat pizza plates, generous pasta bowls, deep bowls for noodles, and square and rectangular dishes to mimic Oriental styles. Further research into market and product availability at major international trade fairs allowed us to assess the gaps in the current market.

50|$|In an American formal dining course, {{each course}} is served sequentially. Guests are <b>served</b> <b>plates</b> already filled with food in {{individual}} portions.
