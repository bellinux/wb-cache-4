40|$|Introduction. Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{is a major}} cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Proper diagnosis of osteoporosis as a <b>systemic</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>effect</b> of COPD is of significant importance. The present study aimed at evaluating the prevalence of osteoporosis and its risk factors in men suffering from COPD in Qazvin (2014). Methods. This descriptive-analytical study was conducted on 90 patients with COPD using random sampling. Anthropometric data and results from physical examination were collected. Pulmonary function test and bone mineral densitometry were done for all participants as well. Results. The prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis in COPD patients was 31. 5 and 52. 8 percent, respectively. Bone mineral density (BMD) at the femoral neck was associated significantly with body mass index (BMI), increased severity of COPD, and use of oral corticosteroid (P< 0. 05). Conclusion. The results showed that patients’ BMI and severity of COPD are two valuable risk factors for osteoporosis screening in COPD patients...|$|E
40|$|Aims: To measure pimecrolimus blood {{concentrations}} and {{to evaluate}} tolerability and efficacy {{in children and}} infants treated topically for atopic dermatitis with pimecrolimus cream 1 % for three weeks. Methods: Three open label, non-controlled, multiple topical dose studies were conducted in children aged 8 – 14 years (study A, ten patients), and in infants aged 8 – 30 months (study B, eight patients) and 4 – 11 months (study C, eight patients). Pimecrolimus blood concentrations were determined on days 4 and 22 of treatment, and at end of study. Efficacy was assessed using the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI). Results: Pimecrolimus blood concentrations were consistently low, typically (81 %) below 1 ng/ml, {{with more than half}} of the measurements below the assay limit of quantitation (0. 5 ng/ml) in studies A and B. The highest blood concentration measured throughout the three studies was 2. 6 ng/ml. The cream was well tolerated, locally and systemically. The most common adverse event suspected to be related to study medication was a transient mild to moderate stinging sensation at the application site in 5 / 26 patients.

40|$|This study {{determined}} the clinical effect of subconjunctival administration of bevacizumab {{in patients with}} primary and recurrent pterygium. The study was an off-label, single-dosing, interventional case series involving 22 patients with primary and recurrent pterygium. They received subconjunctival bevacizumab (0. 2 cc). Pterygium vascularity and thickness was graded. The size of the pterygium (measured by surface area in cm 2) was recorded from baseline to 12 weeks, after injection. Treatment-related complications and adverse events were reported. The main outcome of measurements was the change in size, vascularity, thickness, color intensity. There were 15 males (68. 2 %) and 7 females (31. 8 %) of 22 patients {{with a mean age}} of 45. 5 years (SD 11. 68 years). One cases didn't cooperate, and excluded. There was a significant difference in the mean surface area of pterygium at different intervals (P 0. 05).

40|$|Accumulating {{evidence}} indicates that {{there are at least}} two phenotypes of wheezing in preschool years with distinct natural history Frequent wheezing in the first 3 years of life with risk factors for asthma (e. g., eczema, maternal asthma) predicts symptoms in older age, while infrequent viral-associated wheezing without risk factors for asthma has a benign prognosis. This systematic review summarizes evidence on the use of anti-inflammatory medications in preschool children with wheezing. Literature search was performed using Medline and the Cochrane Library Retrieved articles were critically appraised. Episodic use of high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (> 1, 600 mcg/day of beclomethasone) may ameliorate severity of intermittent viral-associated wheezing. Maintenance inhaled corticosteroids can control symptoms in children with frequent wheezing associated with risk factors for asthma. Inhaled corticosterods do not alter the natural history of wheezing even when started early in life and could have a negative impact on linear growth rate. Short courses of oral corticosteroids have been proposed as an effective measure to control exacerbations of symptoms although there is little evidence supporting their use. Some studies support the administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (leukotriene pathway modifiers, cromones, methylxanthines) for mild frequent wheezing. Maintenance inhaled corticosteroids is the most effective measure for controlling frequent wheezing in preschool children, especially when accompanied by risk factors for asthma. This treatment does not affect the natural history of wheezing, although deceleration of linear growth rate is the most commonly recognized <b>systemic</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>effect.</b> Pediatr Pulmonol. 2007; 42 : 407 - 420.

40|$|ObjectiveCompare the {{clinical}} and pressure walkway gait evolution of dogs after a tibial plateau leveling osteotomy (TPLO) for a cranial cruciate ligament rupture (CrCLR) and treatment {{with either a}} 1 -month course of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or a single postoperative intra-articular (IA) injection of allogeneic neonatal mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). Study designProspective, double-blinded, randomized, controlled, monocentric clinical study. AnimalsSixteen client-owned dogs. Materials and methodsDogs with unilateral CrCLR confirmed by arthroscopy were included. Allogeneic neonatal canine MSCs were obtained from fetal adnexa retrieved after C-section performed on healthy pregnant bitches. The dogs were randomly allocated to either the “MSCs group,” receiving an IA injection of MSCs after TPLO, followed by placebo for 1 [*]month, or the “NSAIDs group,” receiving IA equivalent volume of MSCs vehicle after TPLO, followed by oral NSAID for 1 [*]month. One of the three blinded evaluators assessed the dogs in each group before and after surgery (1, 3, and 6 [*]months). Clinical score and gait and bone healing process were assessed. The data were statistically compared {{between the two groups}} for pre- and postoperative evaluations. ResultsFourteen dogs (nine in the MSCs group, five in the NSAIDs group) completed the present study. No significant difference was observed between the groups preoperatively. No local or <b>systemic</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>effect</b> was observed after MSCs injection at any time point considered. At 1 [*]month after surgery, bone healing scores were significantly higher in the MSCs group. At 1, 3, and 6 [*]months after surgery, no significant difference was observed between the two groups for clinical scores and gait evaluation. ConclusionA single IA injection of allogeneic neonatal MSCs could be a safe and valuable postoperative alternative to NSAIDs for dogs requiring TPLO surgery, particularly for dogs intolerant to this class of drugs...|$|E

We used PET to study the retention and spatial distribution of iododeoxyuridine (IUdR), which {{has been used as a}} DNA-targeting radio-sensitizing drug and which can be charged with therapeutic nuclides. Methods: Locoregional (resection cavity, tumor) instillation of 5 - 19 MBq I- 124 -IUdR was achieved in 7 postoperative patients with malignant gliomas through a reservoir implanted in the skull. Patients were scanned with PET during the first hour and at 2, 24, and 48 h after I- 124 -IUdR instillation. I- 124 -IUdR metabolism was measured in the reservoir fluid in the presence or absence of a degradation inhibitor (5 '-butyryl-IUdR [butyryl-IUdR]). Region-of-interest analysis was applied to calculate intratumoral retention (K-local) of I- 124 -IUdR from the PET images after a 24 -h washout phase using an autoradiographic method. Results: At 24 h, radioactivity concentration in the reservoir was approximately 1 % of the concentration 5 min after tracer instillation. The major metabolite of I- 124 -IUdR in the reservoir was I- 124 -iodouracil. I- 124 -IUdR degradation could be partially inhibited by butyryl-IUdR. In the plasma, radioactivity peaked between 2 and 6 h. The area of tissue radioactivity increased with time up to 3 -fold compared with the initial distribution. Tumor I- 124 -IUdR retention (K-local) ranged from 0. 006 to 0. 017 muL/g/min, which is substantially lower compared with the IUdR-DNA incorporation reported recently after intravenous injection of I- 124 -IUdR (K;, 3. 9 +/- 2. 3 muL/g/min, where K; is the DNA incorporation rate of I- 124 -IUdR after intravenous tracer injection). Conclusion: Although a single injection of I- 124 -IUdR resulted in radioactivity distribution over the tumor, retention at 24 h was substantially lower compared with intravenous injection of I- 124 -IUdR. Slow diffusion after locoregional administration, in contrast to fast delivery via tumor capillaries after intravenous injection, may account for our findings, resulting in a low amount of drug incorporation into DNA before degradation and washout from tissue...|$|E

ObjectivesTo examine the local and <b>systemic</b> efficacy and <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> of whole body clobetasol propionate cream application in patients with mild or severe BP. MethodsOpen, clinical records-based retrospective analysis {{of a series of}} mild (n= 40) and severe (n= 34) BP patients, treated with ranging doses (20 - 40 g/day) clobetasol propionate cream. For assessing systemic effects, we observed in selected cases eosinophil count and morning urine cortisol level. ResultsPatients with mild BP achieved in 90. 0 % disease control and in severe BP in 73. 5 %. Complete remission was achieved in mild BP in 64. 1 % (35. 9 % off therapy and 28. 2 % on therapy) vs. 41. 2 % in severe BP (5. 9 % off therapy and 35. 3 % on therapy).

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are well established as first-line maintenance therapy for persistent asthma. Compared to oral corticosteroids, ICS are considered as safe therapeutic agents {{with a low}} risk of adverse drug reactions. However, studies have emphasized the possibility of adrenal suppression, growth retardation and effects on bone metabolism in asthmatic children and adolescents treated with ICS. Methods. A systematic search was performed using Pubmed and Embase. Results. Clinical significant adrenal suppression and adrenal crisis have been described at doses above 400 microgr a day, particularly with fluticasone. Studies have found a reduction in growth velocity associated with 300 - 400 microgr a day and higher doses. This growth retardation is transient {{and there is no}} effect on final adult height. Exposure to ICS does not increase the fracture risk in children or adolescents. More studies on effects of high dose ICS treatment on bone are needed to further address this issue. Conclusions. The benefits of ICS are well established and far exceed any <b>systemic</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>effects.</b> It is however important {{to be aware of the}} potential risks associated with high dose ICS treatment, and clinical safety guidelines should be followed carefully...|$|R
