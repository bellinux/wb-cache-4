Judah sent Rivera {{down with a}} {{straight}} left hand to the face less than 30seconds into the bout. Rivera beat the count, but was knocked down again about 10seconds later. Judah hit Rivera hard {{several times in the}} second round, and in the third round, he connected with a left uppercut, that caused Rivera to <b>stagger</b> backwards and fall into the ropes before hitting the canvas. Rivera rose at the count of five, but he was badly hurt and the referee stopped the fight.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} game, enemies appear in the open field and can be avoided or engaged. The number of enemies increases during night-time, and their strength and ability to deal damage increases the more days pass in-game. By killing all the standard versions of an enemy, a final version appears as a boss. Defeating it will yield a high reward and make the enemy type extinct {{in an area of}} the game. When Lightning attacks an enemy, or they attack her, the battle starts. If Lightning strikes a monster, they lose a small portion of health, while if the enemy strikes Lightning first, she will lose health. As Lightning performs attacks, her ATB meter is drained and she must switch to another assigned garb: the depleted garb's meter recharges while not being used. Lightning utilizes her many swords for short-range melee attacks and magic for long-range attacks. She can block enemy attacks using her shield and has the option to evade an attack, which can be assigned to any garb. Each enemy has a <b>stagger</b> meter, represented by a line behind their health bar. As Lightning lands certain kinds of magical or physical blows on the enemy, their meter oscillates more. Eventually, the enemy is staggered, rendering them vulnerable to damaging attacks. Lightning can also spend Energy Points to perform special moves or activate abilities, such as Overclock (which slows time for Lightning's opponents and enables her to land more hits); and Army of One, Lightning's signature move. By winning battles, Lightning earns gil, the in-game currency, and replenishes a portion of her Energy Point gauge. In Normal and Hard modes, if Lightning flees from or dies in battle, one in-game hour is lost. Unlike the last two games, the player character does not automatically recover HP after battles, instead needing to use remedies bought from merchants and shops, and there is no auto-battle mode, with Lightning needing to be controlled manually at all times. In Easy Mode, Lightning regenerates health if she stands idle.|$|E

40|$|The {{competition}} between the <b>staggered</b> flux state, or the d-density wave state, and the d-wave pairing state is analyzed in two-dimensional t-J model based on the U(1) slave boson mean-field theory. Not only <b>staggered</b> flux of spinon but also <b>staggered</b> flux of holon are considered. In this formalism, the hopping order parameter of physical electron is described by the product of hopping order parameters of spinon and holon. The <b>staggered</b> flux amplitude of electron is the difference of <b>staggered</b> flux amplitude of spinon and that of holon. In π-flux phase of spinon, <b>staggered</b> fluxes of spinon and holon cancel completely and <b>staggered</b> flux order of electron does not exist. However, in <b>staggered</b> flux phase of spinon whose <b>staggered</b> flux amplitude is not π, fluxes does not cancel completely and <b>staggered</b> flux amplitude of electron remains. Thus, the phase transition between these two phases, π-flux phase and <b>staggered</b> flux phase of spinon, becomes a second order transition in physical electron picture. The order parameter which characterizes this transition is <b>staggered</b> flux order parameter of electron. A mean-field phase diagram is shown. It is proved analytically {{that there is no}} coexisistence of <b>staggered</b> flux and d-wave pairing. The temperature dependences of Fermi surface and excitation gap at (0,π) are shown.

5|$|Each enemy has a meter, {{called a}} chain counter, {{consisting}} of a percentage starting at 100 which increases when the enemy is struck by attacks or spells. Attacks by different roles have different effects; some raise the chain by a larger amount while others give the player longer before the chain counter resets. The amount of damage performed by an attack is multiplied by the chain percentage before it {{is applied to the}} enemy. When the chain counter reaches a preset amount, different for each enemy, the enemy is placed into <b>Stagger</b> State. In this mode, the enemy has lowered defense and may be launched into the air. The Paradigm system allows the player to program six different roles which the characters can then assume to perform certain formations in battle in response to the specific conditions. The roles consist of Commando, a warrior-type role; Ravager, a black mage-type role which uses damage-dealing magic; Medic, a White Mage-type role which can heal and remove negative status ailments; Saboteur, which uses magic to weaken enemies by inflicting negative statuses; Synergist, which uses magic to strengthen allies by giving positive statuses; and Sentinel, which has protective and defensive abilities similar to a paladin. Each of the characters can initially take on only three roles, but the player has access to all of them later in the game (although the other three roles are limited in their abilities for those players which choose them). The player can select which roles the controlled character and the AI characters are using both outside and during battle, which is the only way that the player can control the AI characters during battle. The player can only choose from specific sets of paradigms that the player has set up beforehand outside of battle.|$|E

The best known such model assumes Calvo-style <b>staggering</b> of prices and flexible wages {{and is known}} to yield no persistence under a Taylor Rule. Switching to Taylor-style <b>staggering</b> introduces lagged output into the model’s ‘New Keynesian Phillips Curve’ equation.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{influence}} of wage and price <b>staggering</b> on monetary persistence. We show that, for plausible parameter values, wage and price <b>staggering</b> are highly complementary in generating monetary persistence. We do so by proposing the new measure "quantitative persistence," after discussing weaknesses of the "contract multiplier," which is generally used to compare persistence. The existence of complementarities means that beyond understanding how wage and price <b>staggering</b> work in isolation, {{it is important to}} explore their interactions. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the degree of monetary persistence generated by wage vis-à-vis price <b>staggering</b> depends on the relative competitiveness of the labour and product markets. We show that the conventional wisdom that wage <b>staggering</b> can generate more persistence than price <b>staggering</b> does not necessarily hold. monetary persistence; monetary policy; price staggering; wage <b>staggering...</b>|$|R

In the case of unimproved <b>staggered</b> fermions, we observe (consistent with previous work) that O(a 2) taste symmetry breaking effects are large and comparable to the ≈ O(p 2) contributions to their masses. Higher order O(a 2 p 2) effects are also substantial enough to be seen. For HYP-smeared <b>staggered</b> fermions, we find that taste breaking is much reduced. The O(a 2) effects are observable, but are noticeably smaller than those obtained with AsqTad-improved <b>staggered</b> fermions, and much smaller than those obtained using unimproved <b>staggered</b> fermions, while O(a 2 p 2) effects are suppressed to level that we cannot observe them given our statistical errors.

40|$|For a {{multi-sensor}} {{target tracking}} system, {{the effects of}} temporally <b>staggered</b> sensors on system performance are investigated and {{compared with those of}} synchronous sensors. To capture system performance over time, a new metric, the average estimation error variance (AEV), is proposed. For a system that has N sensors with equal measurement noise variance, numerical results show that the optimal <b>staggering</b> pattern is to use N uniformly <b>staggered</b> sensors. We have also shown analytically that the AEV of the system with N uniformly <b>staggered</b> sensors is always smaller than that of the system with N synchronous sensors. For sensors with different measurement noise variances, the optimal <b>staggering</b> pattern can be found numerically. Practical guidelines on selecting the optimal <b>staggering</b> pattern have been presented for different target tracking scenarios.

25|$|In {{order to}} make the {{aircraft}} more manoeuvrable and in particular to increase its roll rate, a triplane configuration was chosen. This provided about the same total wing area as that of the biplane Scout with a lower moment of inertia about the roll axis. The Triplane had single-bay wings with heavy <b>stagger,</b> carrying six ailerons. The lower wing was close to the ground so two underwing skids were added below the interplane struts. The mid-line of the nacelle, with the engine at its rear, was on the centre plane, giving the pilot a slightly inferior view than from the Scout.|$|E
