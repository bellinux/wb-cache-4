50|$|In BHC systems the {{movement}} of the mass is not parallel to {{the movement}} of the <b>spring</b> <b>cylinder,</b> leading to significantly lower residual forces, and therefore lower requirements on the active components. In BHC systems, load amplification is unlikely to occur since the mass is balanced in two positions and substantially balanced around these two positions. Residual forces are minimized and therefore unexpected conditions such as variations in the wave pattern have a negligible effect on the working principle. BHC is therefore best characterized as an AHC with a lower power requirement.|$|E
50|$|In {{traditional}} spring based heave {{compensation systems}} {{the movement of}} the mass is parallel to {{the movement of the}} <b>spring</b> <b>cylinder.</b> A passive heave compensation system is in effect a mass spring system, it stabilizes a certain mass in a single position of the spring, in that position only the spring and the mass are balanced. In other positions of the spring the mass and the spring are not balanced and the mass will tend to start moving towards the stabilized position due to residual forces in the spring. Therefore, only in certain (preset) conditions a mass spring system can be beneficial for heave compensation. In other (unexpected) conditions, mass spring systems may experience unwanted effects such as load amplification. An active heave compensation system adds an active component to a passive heave compensation system in order to counteract these residual forces.|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 9 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Malta, 16 - 18 July, 2012. The establishment of a reliable methodology {{for the design of}} a host of practical thermal and thermodynamic systems demands the development of a framework that can accurately predict their performance by accounting formally for the underlying unsteady and conjugate heat transfer processes that are undergone as part of their operation. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present a framework that includes such a description and to show results from its application to the characterisation of a reciprocating compression and expansion process. Specifically, an unsteady and conjugate heat transfer model is proposed that solves the one-dimensional unsteady heat conduction equation in the solid simultaneously with the first law in the gas phase, with an imposed heat transfer coefficient taken from relevant experimental studies in the literature. This model is applied to the study of thermal losses in gas springs. Beyond the explicit inclusion of conjugate heat transfer, the present model goes beyond previous efforts by considering the case of imposed volumetric compression and by allowing the resulting gas pressure to vary accordingly. Notable effects of the solid walls of the gas spring are revealed, with worst case thermodynamic cycle losses of up to 14 % (relative to equivalent adiabatic and reversible processes) for cases in which unfavourable solid and gas materials are selected, and closer to 11 % for more common material choices. The contribution of the solid towards these values, through the dimensionless thickness of the gas <b>spring</b> <b>cylinder</b> wall, is about 8 % and 2 %, respectively, showing a non-monotonic trend with the thermodynamic losses; increasing with increased solid thickness, reaching a maximum and then decreasing again. These results suggest strongly that, in designing highefficiency reciprocating machines, the full conjugate and unsteady problem must be considered and that the role of the solid in determining the performance of the cycle undergone by the gas cannot, in general, be neglected. dc 201...|$|E

By the end of 1918, shortly after the war ended, only 251 weapons had been completed; 34 had been shipped to France but did not see action. A combination of a limited pre-war munitions industry, the short (19-month) US participation in the war, technical problems with large-scale production, and the ready availability of munitions in France led to this.|$|R

40|$|Summary. “Vortex-induced {{vibration}} ” (VIV) of a <b>sprung</b> <b>cylinder</b> is {{a familiar}} fluid-structure interaction phenomenon occurring {{over a wide range}} of flow Reynolds number (Re). From a dynamical systems perspective, at critical Reynolds number (Rec), the fixed point of the wake oscillator loses its stability resulting in limit-cycle oscillation, which is a well known supercritical Hopf bifurcation. In this paper, we discuss the relation between the critical Reynolds number (Rec) for the Hopf bifurcation and the stiffness of the <b>cylinder</b> for a <b>sprung</b> rigid circular <b>cylinder.</b> In addition, we introduce a rotational “nonlinear energy sink ” (NES) into the system and study its effect on Rec in subcritical flow regime. Formulation of coupled system with rotational NES The essentially nonlinear device, termed the rotational NES, as discussed in [2], consists of a small mass and a viscous damper. The NES mass is constrained to rotate at a fixed radius about the oscillating center of the cylinder, with the cylinder motion constrained to be perpendicular to the mean flow. A schematic of the rotating NES attached to the cylinder is shown in Fig. 1. The damping of the NES necessary for dissipation is assumed to be a linear viscous damper.

50|$|Piston seals were a {{perennial}} problem at this time. Those for large stationary engines, working at low pressures, were sealed {{by a variety}} of methods including leather cup washers, pools of standing water and even a poultice of cow dung. As working pressures increased, which had been an essential part of turning the steam engine into the steam locomotive, demands on the piston seal increased further. Pistons were now mostly sealed by having oakum rope wrapped around them in a groove, often smeared with tallow. Keeping the rope seal moist, thus swollen, was recognised as an important factor in achieving a good seal. As the steam <b>spring</b> <b>cylinders</b> were in {{the lower part of the}} boiler, below the water line, it was expected that they would seal well. Despite this, they continued to give trouble with leakage and were eventually removed and replaced with iron or steel leaf springs. Wood in 1831 illustrates one of the Killingworth locomotives, now fitted with metal leaf springs and also coupling rods.|$|R

50|$|A {{single-acting}} cylinder in a {{reciprocating engine}} is a cylinder {{in which the}} working fluid acts {{on one side of}} the piston only. A single-acting cylinder relies on the load, <b>springs,</b> other <b>cylinders,</b> or the momentum of a flywheel, to push the piston back in the other direction. Single-acting cylinders are found in most kinds of reciprocating engine.

50|$|Understanding {{where all}} the energy goes during the {{combustion}} process is important to properly designing gun and recoil systems. Recoil energy is initially absorbed by the <b>springs</b> and hydraulic <b>cylinders</b> of the buffering system, or {{the body of the}} shooter, which produces the counter-recoil force. The kinetic energy of recoil is then slowly dissipated as heat energy. For a hand-held firearm, the energy is absorbed by the shooter's body, creating a small amount of heat in muscles and bones. For the naval cannon from the figure above, it will roll backwards and the recoil energy will be mostly absorbed by the friction forces in the wheel axles and between the wheel and the ship deck and this energy is again converted to heat.|$|R
50|$|A key {{safety feature}} was a novel braking system that {{consisted}} of an automotive disc brakes attached to the vehicles driveshafts.

In the event of loss of electrical power, the hydraulic pressure holding the brakes was lost and <b>springs</b> inside the <b>cylinders</b> forced brake fluid into the calipers of the disc braking system, ensuring that the vehicles did not simply coast to a stop. In order to provide for a controlled deceleration, a pendulum valve was located {{in line with the}} brake actuation cylinders. Pendulums inside the valve reacted to the deceleration profile of the vehicle and would partially close, reducing the pressure in the brake lines and moderating the deceleration so that the emergency stop was not dangerously abrupt.|$|R

5|$|Frank Williams led an {{abortive}} {{protest against}} the car at the Argentine Grand Prix, objecting to {{the flexibility of the}} fixed skirts used to seal the underside of the car, which allowed them to replicate the effect of a sliding skirt. At the following race, the scrutineers rejected the flexible skirts. Brabham replaced them with stiffer material from one of the other teams for the race, which Piquet won. As the season progressed, other teams developed their own lowering systems—a front <b>spring</b> and <b>cylinder</b> were stolen from the Brabham garage in Argentina— but after a rule clarification from FISA many cars were lowered by the driver pressing a switch, a development that Murray found frustrating in light of Brabham's efforts to develop a system that he considered legal. The cars ran on Goodyear tyres again from the sixth round of the championship; motorsport author Doug Nye believes this cost the BT49s good results at several races while the American company adapted to the latest Formula One developments. Despite the virtually solid suspension now required to maintain a consistent ride height, which put components under greater strain, Piquet built a championship challenge on the back of consistent reliability: {{by the end of the}} season, his BT49Cs had finished 10 of 15 races, with only one mechanical failure.

40|$|Abstract. Gas Spring is an {{important}} component of an energy storing prosthetic knee. The spring stored energy during flexion and released the energy while in the extension.

The simulation is used to predict the effects of three important design variables of a gas <b>spring</b> which are <b>cylinder</b> diameter, cylinder length, and displacement to the energy storing performance of the spring. The results of simulation show that there are two design variables which have significant contribution to the variations of energy storing performance: cylinder diameter and displacement. Those design variables account for 99. 3 % to the total variance of energy storing. Quality improvement must be conducted to lowering the resulted energy storing variance. We proportionally decrease the variance of the design variables to lowering the energy storing variance. The simulation results show a significant quality improvement of about 50 % in term of energy storing standard deviation. The results also show that cylinder diameter is more sensitive than the other two design variables in energy storing quality improvement...|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} {{deactivate}} a cylinder, the exhaust valve is prevented from opening after the power stroke and the exhaust gas charge is {{retained in the}} cylinder and compressed during the exhaust stroke. Following the exhaust stroke, the intake valve is prevented from opening. The exhaust gas in the cylinder is expanded and compressed {{over and over again}} and acts like a gas <b>spring.</b> As multiple <b>cylinders</b> are shut off at a time (cylinders 1, 4, 6 and 7 for a V8), the power required for compression of the exhaust gas in one cylinder is countered by the decompression of retained exhaust gas in another. When more power is called for, the exhaust valve is reactivated and the old exhaust gas is expelled during the exhaust stroke. The intake valve is likewise reactivated and normal engine operation is resumed. The net effect of cylinder deactivation is an improvement in fuel economy and likewise a reduction in exhaust emissions. General Motors was the first to modify existing, production engines to enable cylinder deactivation, with the introduction of the Cadillac L62 [...] "V8-6-4" [...] in 1981.|$|R
50|$|In a soft-recoil system, the <b>spring</b> (or air <b>cylinder)</b> that {{returns the}} barrel to the forward {{position}} starts {{out in a}} nearly fully compressed position, then the gun's barrel is released free to fly forward in the moment before firing; the charge is then ignited just as the barrel reaches the fully forward position. Since the barrel is still moving forward when the charge is ignited, {{about half of the}} recoil impulse is applied to stopping the forward motion of the barrel, while the other half is, as in the usual system, taken up in recompressing the spring. A latch then catches the barrel and holds it in the starting position. This roughly halves the energy that the spring needs to absorb, and also roughly halves the peak force conveyed to the mount, as compared to the usual system. However, the need to reliably achieve ignition at a single precise instant is a major practical difficulty with this system; and unlike the usual hydro-pneumatic system, soft-recoil systems do not easily deal with hangfires or s. One of the early guns to use this system was the French 65 mm mle.1906; it was also used by the World War II British PIAT man-portable anti-tank weapon.|$|R
2500|$|The system {{comprises}} two {{suspension cylinders}} mounted horizontally {{on each side}} of the platform chassis. Inside the <b>cylinders</b> are two <b>springs,</b> one for each wheel, mounted at each end of the <b>cylinder.</b> The <b>springs</b> are connected to the front leading swinging arm and rear trailing swinging arm, that act like bellcranks by pull rods (tie rods). These are connected to spring seating cups in the middle of the <b>cylinder,</b> each <b>spring</b> being compressed independently, against the ends of the cylinder. Each cylinder is mounted using an additional set of springs, originally made from steel, called [...] "volute" [...] springs, on later models made from rubber. These allow the front and rear suspension to interconnect. When the front wheel is deflected up over a bump, the front pull rod compresses the front <b>spring</b> inside the <b>cylinder,</b> against the front of the cylinder. This also compresses the front [...] "volute" [...] spring pulling the whole cylinder forwards. That action pulls the rear wheel down on the same side via the rear spring assembly and pull rod. When the rear wheel meets that bump a moment later, it does the same in reverse, keeping the car level front to rear. When both springs are compressed on one side when travelling around a bend, or front and rear wheels hit bumps simultaneously, the equal and opposite forces applied to the front and rear spring assemblies reduce the interconnection. It reduces pitching, which is a particular problem of soft car suspension.|$|R
