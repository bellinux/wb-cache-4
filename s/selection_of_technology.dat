While {{away from the city}} he walks past a shop where the TV in the window happens to be showing an {{interview}} with Burton, who will be receiving a bravery award, and also triggers his memory of the murder - he realises that a CCTV camera had filmed the whole event. He realises that this security tape will clear his name and show that Burton was the real murderer. He returns to the club where the murder took place to try to find the tape, only to discover that it has been taken to a bank and placed in a safety deposit box. Simon sets out to round up his four successful ex-clients. He visits George in Blackpool and convinces him to join the plan. They then recruit Jeff, who has been working as a fishmonger, and Colin, who has been working in a computer shop.

40|$|Abstract. The {{notion of}} {{technology}} innovation {{is similar to}} the phenomena of natural evolution because a lot of concepts in technology innovation such as technology trajectory and path dependency was originated the ideas of evolutionary theory. However, existing studies just deal with conceptual relationship between technology evolution and biological evolution without quantitative, detailed analysis. Genetic algorithm is a good approach which can investigate the evolution of promising technology by defining the mutation and <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>technology.</b> Thus, this research aims at proposing a new approach to applying the genetic algorithm to grasp the evolution path of technology. For this, first, the analogy between technology evolution and natural evolution is identified. Second, the morphology of a selected technology is defined by extracting the keyword information from patent documents which are collected from database of USTPO (United State Trade and Patent Office) through text mining. Third, genetic algorithm is applied to analyze the evolutionary pattern of technology and derive the configurations of promising technology with software, describing the cells, mutation and <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>technology...</b>|$|E

40|$|The UK Government is {{committed}} to all new homes being zero-carbon from 2016. The use of low and zero carbon (LZC) technologies is recognised by housing developers as being {{a key part of}} the solution to deliver against this zero-carbon target. The paper takes as its starting point that the <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> new <b>technologies</b> by firms is not a phenomenon which takes place within a rigid sphere of technical rationality (for example, Rip and Kemp, 1998). Rather, technology forms and diffusion trajectories are driven and shaped by myriad socio-technical structures, interests and logics. A literature review is offered to contribute to a more critical and systemic foundation for understanding the socio-technical features <b>of</b> the <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> LZC <b>technologies</b> in new housing. The problem is investigated through a multidisciplinary lens consisting of two perspectives: technological and institutional. The synthesis of the perspectives crystallises the need to understand that the <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> LZC <b>technologies</b> by housing developers is not solely dependent on technical or economic efficiency, but on the emergent ‘fit’ between the intrinsic properties <b>of</b> the <b>technologies,</b> institutional logics and the interests and beliefs of various actors in the housing development process...|$|R

40|$|Fulltext in: [URL] {{the design}} and {{construction}} of sustainable retail buildings, there are various stakeholders involved with the overall aim of selecting appropriate sustainable technologies to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions. Previous studies and literature review indicate there is no comprehensive selection process to assist stakeholders. This can be classified as a complex multi-criteria decision problem due to {{the high number of}} alternatives, potential solutions and variety of stakeholders (e. g. clients, professional advisors, end-users) with multiple, often conflicting, objectives leading in turn to the slow take-up <b>of</b> sustainable <b>technologies.</b> There is a demand for a systematic and effective evaluation tool for the <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> sustainable <b>technologies</b> based on the needs of stakeholders. This paper is part of an on-going study to develop a decision making system to assist stakeholders in the selection process and aims to establish the decision criteria for the <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> sustainable <b>technologies</b> for existing retail buildings based on the clients' (retailers') perspective. The arguments are informed by a combination of literature review and an in-depth case study with a leading construction company in the UK. The data collected was both qualitative (establishing and verifying decision criteria) and quantitative (establishing weightings and priorities). Five broad decision criteria currently used by clients in the <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> sustainable <b>technologies</b> to achieve reductions in energy and carbon were established (i. e. cost, time, proven success <b>of</b> <b>technology,</b> risk and sustainability). Using AHP survey and expert opinions, the identified criteria were weighted and ranked, with risk (37 %) being the most important, followed by cost (22 %), proven success (20 %) and time (12 %), and sustainability (9 %) the least important factor. Although the established criteria would be most relevant for the <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> sustainable <b>technologies</b> for existing retail buildings, it will also be beneficial for new build retail buildings and be transferable to other types of buildings...|$|R
