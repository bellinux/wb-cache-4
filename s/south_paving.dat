Brown, formed the Evangelical Lutheran Holston Synod. However the Tennessee Synod kept its name, and so after 1860, it had congregations in Virginia, North and South Carolina, and Alabama, but none in Tennessee. In 1886 the Tennessee Synod (along with the Holston Synod and other southern synods) joined the United Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in the <b>South,</b> <b>paving</b> the way for the Tennessee Synod's merger into the United Synod of North Carolina in 1920, which ended the Tennessee Synod's history as a separate body.|$|E
40|$|With {{the aid of}} hindsight, the {{landmark}} Civil Rights legislation of 1964 and 1965, which shattered the system of racial segregation {{dating back to the}} nineteenth century in the southern states, is clearly identifiable as a positive stimulus to regional economic development. Although the South’s convergence toward national per capita income standards began earlier, any number of economic indicators – personal income, business investment, retail sales – show a positive acceleration from the mid 1960 s onward, after a hiatus during the previous decade. Surveying the record, journalist Peter Applebome marveled at “the utterly unexpected way the Civil Rights revolution {{turned out to be the}} best thing that ever happened to the white <b>South,</b> <b>paving</b> the way for the region’s newfound prosperity ” (Dixie Rising, p. 17). But this observation poses a paradox for business and economic history. Normally we presume that business groups take political positions in order to promote their own economic interests, albeit at times shortsightedly. But here we have a case in which regional businesses and businessmen, with few exceptions, supported segregation and opposed state and national efforts at racial integration, a policy that subsequentl...|$|E
40|$|This {{riveting}} tale of greed, international skullduggery, and behind-the-scenes heroism {{recounts the}} events {{that led up to}} America’s “wicked war” with Mexico. It depicts how expansionist ambitions in high circles fueled jingoistic propaganda (pp. 25, 34 – 35, 58), fed a public eager for national muscle flexing (pp. 57, 103, 108), and {{set the stage for a}} military skirmish in a disputed region between two rivers (pp. 75 – 77, 95, 100, 138) that provided the pretext for a savage and short-lived military campaign against the weak new nation of Mexico in which the U. S. Army, under General Scott, marched all the way to Mexico City, marauding as it went. On arrival, President Polk’s negotiator dictated terms of surrender under which Mexico ceded nearly half its territory — what is now the states of California, Nevada, and Utah, and parts of Arizona, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas (pp. xvii, 258 – 61) — a land grab that accounts for about one-third of the current continental United States. As America’s first foreign campaign, the War with Mexico strengthened the hold of slavery in the <b>South,</b> <b>paving</b> the way for the Civil War a generation later. It launched Lincoln’s career, although he opposed it (p. xvi); brought Henry Thoreau, who abhorred it, to national prominence; and sparked the country’s first antiwar movement (p. xvi). With its explicitly racist rhetoric, the war marked the first time in the United States’ seventy-year history that it invoked race as a justification for expanding its borders. The war also facilitated future uses of racist rhetoric in oppressing domestic minorities. Let us first examine the war itself as portrayed in Amy S. Greenberg’s A Wicked War: Polk, Clay, Lincoln, and the 1846 U. S. Invasion of Mexico. This will first entail examining the parts played by five political figures — some young, some senior — together with their families and children. Then we shall show the prominent role of what we call “racial templates” — linguistic frames, habits, and attitudes of mind — in the War with Mexico and later. As we shall see, these templates, often operating at an unconscious level, predisposed society and individual actors to reproduce risky or oppressive behavior in arenas far beyond the ones in which they first emerged. Identifying these templates is a necessary first step in reducing their sway...|$|E

The blocks between 14th and 18th Avenues and Yesler Way and Jackson Street still retain a strong Japanese presence—the Buddhist Church, Seattle Koyasan Church, Konko, Wisteria Park, Japanese Congregational Church, Keiro Nursing Home, and the Kawabe Memorial House. During World War II, presidential Executive Order 9066 made {{possible}} the removal of American citizens of Japanese descent from the West Coast.
