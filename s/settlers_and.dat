5|$|The {{indigenous}} population {{at the time}} of the first European settlements is estimated to have been between 200,000 and two million, with a figure of 500,000 accepted by Canada's Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples. As a consequence of European colonization, the population of Canada's indigenous peoples declined by forty to eighty percent, and several First Nations, such as the Beothuk, disappeared. The decline is attributed to several causes, including the transfer of European diseases, such as influenza, measles, and smallpox to which they had no natural immunity, conflicts over the fur trade, conflicts with the colonial authorities and <b>settlers,</b> <b>and</b> the loss of indigenous lands to <b>settlers</b> <b>and</b> the subsequent collapse of several nations' self-sufficiency.|$|E

5|$|When Hudson {{returned}} to Cleaveland, he found few <b>settlers</b> <b>and</b> no food to spare. He continued east on Lake Erie {{to the mouth}} of Cattaraugus Creek, a stream in Western New York. There, Hudson obtained food and brought it back to the settlement.|$|E
5|$|A {{slightly}} later route {{along the}} parallel was a wagon road, built between 1857 and 1860, that involved experimental use of camels as transport. In the late 19thcentury, <b>settlers</b> <b>and</b> private stagecoach companies followed similar east–west routes. Homesteaders who {{stayed in the}} area developed cattle ranches on the grasslands, and cattle grazed in the Petrified Forest until the mid-20thcentury.|$|E

5|$|By the mid-1860s a deep rift had {{developed}} between Irataba, who was proactive in cooperating with white <b>settlers,</b> <b>and</b> Homoseh quahote, who passively tolerated {{but did not}} approve of white encroachment on Mohave lands. Irataba was Aha macave yaltanack of the Mohave from 1861 to 1866, but from 1867 to 1869 opinions differ, and by 1870 US government correspondence suggests that Homoseh quahote had succeeded him {{as leader of the}} Fort Mohave group.|$|E
5|$|Edwards had {{not been}} {{governor}} long when Illinois became the scene of fighting during the War of 1812.

5|$|Gambier {{and pepper}} farming were mainly {{confined}} to the Bintan (formerly spelled as Bentan) and Galang Islands. Similar to the Kangchu system in Johor, gambier and pepper plantations were established on grants of land by the Yamtuan Muda of Riau, who would issue land permits (Surat Sungai) to the Kangchu who would direct {{the operations of the}} plantation and workers within the settlement. In the early and middle 19th century, many Chinese <b>settlers</b> <b>and</b> merchants from Riau relocated their businesses to Singapore, and established trading links between Riau and Singapore. These <b>settlers</b> <b>and</b> merchants still maintained trading links with Riau, as the Kangchu from Riau often shipped their produce to Singapore for free trade to evade taxes imposed by the Dutch colonial government. Like Singapore, competition for the gambier and pepper trade between the Teochews and Hokkiens in Riau led to communal tensions and sporadic violence in Riau during the 1840s and 1850s. In the early 20th century, the Chinese abandoned gambier and pepper plantations in favour of other agricultural practices, as the worldwide prices for gambier experienced a drastic drop in value and many pepper plants fell prey to a disease plaguing the archipelago.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, the Second Intifada (also called al-Aqsa Intifada) began, and Israel built a {{separation}} barrier.

5|$|Increased {{presence}} of white settlers in Indian Territory prompted the United States Government {{to establish the}} Dawes Act in 1887, which divided the lands of individual tribes into allotments for individual families, encouraging farming and private land ownership among Native Americans but expropriating land to the federal government.

5|$|The Battle of Bad Axe, {{also known}} as the Bad Axe Massacre, was a battle between Sauk (Sac) and Fox Indians and United States Army regulars and militia {{occurred}} 1–2 August 1832.

5|$|The Black Hawk War of 1832 {{resulted}} {{in the deaths of}} at least 70 <b>settlers</b> <b>and</b> soldiers, and hundreds of Black Hawk's band.

The end of the war at Bad Axe ended the large-scale threat of Native American attacks in northwest Illinois, and allowed further settlement of Illinois and what became Iowa and Wisconsin.|$|E
