40|$|A phytosociological {{study was}} {{conducted}} in the National Park of Alta Murgia in the Apulia region (Southern Italy) to determine the adverse effects of metal contamination of soils on the distribution of plant communities. The phytosociological analyses have shown a remarkable biodiversity of vegetation on non-contaminated soils, while biodiversity appeared strongly reduced on metal-contaminated soils. The area is naturally covered by a wide <b>steppic</b> <b>grassland</b> dominated by Stipa austroitalica Martinovsky subsp. austroitalica. Brassicaceae such as Sinapis arvensis L. are the dominating species on moderated contaminated soils, whereas spiny species of Asteraceae such as Silybum marianum (L.) Gaertn. and Carduus pycnocephalus L. subsp. pycnocephalus are the dominating vegetation on heavily metal-contaminated soils. The presence of these spontaneous species on contaminated soils suggest their potential for restoration of degraded lands by phytostabilization strategy...|$|E
40|$|The {{diversity}} of early spring vascular flora was {{studied in the}} Sub- pannonic <b>steppic</b> <b>grassland</b> {{in the village of}} Bilje, north eastern Croatia. In all, 109 plant taxa within 35 families were found. The highest number of taxa belongs to the families Poaceae, Fabaceae, Asteraceae, Caryophyllaceae, Lamiaceae and Rosaceae. Specific habitat conditions, characterized by moderately wet and moderately acidic soil with intermediate fertility and the effects of the continental climate favour the development of different plant life forms. Out of the total recorded plant taxa, hemicryptophytes make up 59. 6 %, followed by therophytes (22. 0 %) and geophytes (13. 8 %). Chorological analysis shows that the most numerous are plants of Eurasian (33. 9 %), Pontic-Central-Asian (21. 1 %) and Central European (21. 1 %) floral elements. According to their status in the Red List, three critically endangered (CR), one vulnerable (VU) and three nearly threatened (NT) plant species were found. Altogether, the steppe-like grassland in Bilje is a unique habitat rich in valuable plants of the Croatian flora, including the critically endangered Doronicum hungaricum, therefore it is of great importance to preserve it. Important management tools include mowing and controlling the spreading of cultivated and invasive plant species...|$|E
50|$|Stipa tenacissima is an {{endemic species}} of the Western Mediterranean countries. It grows in Spain, Portugal, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya. Grows over poor soils in dry conditions, forming a <b>steppic</b> <b>grasslands,</b> managed by people since centuries.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} new {{records of}} the spider Atypus muralis Bertkau, 1890 in the valleys of the rivers Saale and Unstrut {{in the south of}} Saxony-Anhalt in Middle Germany. All specimens were males, caught by pitfall traps in xerothermic <b>steppic</b> <b>grasslands</b> on steep slopes. The geographic distribution of Atypus muralis in the eastern parts of Germany and habitat traits are discussed with special reference to regional climate, vegetation type and soil conditions. The phenology of aboveground activity of Atypus muralis males is shown...|$|R
40|$|A multi-proxy palaeoecological {{investigation}} including pollen, plant macrofossil, radiocarbon and sedimentological analyses, {{was performed}} on a small mountain lake in the Eastern Pyrenees. This has allowed the reconstruction of: (1) the vegetation history of the area based on five pollen diagrams and eight AMS 14 C dates and (2) the past lake-level changes, based on plant macrofossil, lithological and pollen analysis of two stratigraphical transects correlated by pollen analysis. The palaeolake may have appeared before the Younger Dryas; the lake-level was low and the vegetation dominated by cold <b>steppic</b> <b>grasslands.</b> The lake-level rose to its highest level during the Holocene in the Middle Atlantic (at ca. 5060 ± 45 b. p.). Postglacial forests (Quercetum mixtum and Abieto-Fagetum) developed progressively in {{the lower part of}} the valley, while dense Pinus uncinata forests rapidly invaded the surroundings of the mire and remained the dominant local vegetation until present. The observed lowering of the lake levels during the Late Atlantic and the Subboreal (from 5060 ± B. P. to 3590 ± 40 b. p.) was related to the overgrowth of the mire. The first obvious indications of anthropogenic disturbances of the vegetation are recorded at the Atlantic/Subboreal boundary as a reduction in the forest component, which has accelerated during the last two millennia...|$|R
40|$|We reconstructed {{vegetation}} {{responses to}} climate oscillations, fire and human activities {{since the last}} glacial maximum in inland NW Iberia, where previous paleoecological research is scarce. Extremely sparse and open vegetation composed of <b>steppic</b> <b>grasslands</b> and heathlands with scattered pioneer trees suggests very cold and dry conditions during the Oldest Dryas, unsuitable for tree survival in the surroundings of the study site. Slight woodland expansion during the Bolling/Allerod was interrupted by the Younger Dryas cooling. Pinewoods dominated {{for most of the}} early Holocene, when a marked increase in fire activity occurred. Deciduous trees expanded later reaching their maximum representation during the mid-Holocene. Enhanced fire activity and the presence of coprophilous fungi around 6400 - 6000 cal yr BP suggest an early human occupation around the site. However, extensive deforestation only started at 4500 calyrBP, when fire was used to clear the tree canopy. Final replacement of woodlands with heathlands, grasslands and cereal crops occurred from 2700 cal yr BP onwards due to land-use intensification. Our paleoecological record can help efforts aimed at restoring the natural vegetation by indicating which communities were dominant at the onset of heavy human impact, thus promoting the recovery of currently rare oak and alder stands...|$|R
40|$|DNA barcoding {{facilitates}} many evolutionary {{and ecological}} studies, including {{the examination of}} the dietary diversity of herbivores. In this study, we present a survey of ecological associations between herbivorous beetles and host plants from seriously threatened European <b>steppic</b> <b>grasslands.</b> We determined host plants for the majority (65 %) of steppic leaf beetles (55 species) and weevils (59) known from central Europe using two barcodes (trnL and rbcL) and two sequencing strategies (Sanger for mono/oligophagous species and Illumina for polyphagous taxa). To better understand the ecological associations between steppic beetles and their host plants, we tested the hypothesis that leaf beetles and weevils differ in food selection {{as a result of their}} phylogenetic relations (within genera and between families) and interactions with host plants. We found 224 links between the beetles and the plants. Beetles belonging to seven genera feed on the same or related plants. Their preferences were probably inherited from common ancestors and/or resulted from the host plant's chemistry. Beetles from four genera feed on different plants, possibly reducing intrageneric competition and possibly due to an adaptation to different plant chemical defences. We found significant correlations between the numbers of leaf beetle and weevil species feeding on particular plants for polyphagous taxa, but not for nonpolyphagous beetles. Finally, we found that the previous identifications of host plants based on direct observations are generally concordant with host plant barcoding from insect gut. Our results expand basic knowledge about the trophic relations of steppic beetles and plants and are immediately useful for conservation purposes...|$|R
40|$|To {{examine the}} {{necessity}} of livestock grazing for managing threatened sand vegetation so as to en-sure and develop its nature-conservation value, we investigated a grazing system in a model nature reserve (German upper Rhine valley) characterized by threatened <b>steppic</b> sandy <b>grassland</b> (Allio-Stipetum vegetation complex: Habitats Directive Annex I, priority type 6240, additionally Koelerion glaucae: priority type 6120). The area has been grazed by sheep and additionally by donkeys since late summer of the year 2000. We established ungrazed (Au) and grazed plots (Ag) in the Allio-Stipetum complex in a systematic grid-plot design before grazing impact started. We sampled phytosociological relevés yearly in the Au/Ag plots for 12 vegetation periods. Addi-tionally, we sampled relevés on former farmland adjacent to the Allio-Stipetum complex (systematic grid-plot design) over ten vegetation periods. These former fields (Fg) were integrated in the grazing system {{since the beginning of}} the study. A constancy table was produced for Au, Ag, Fg. To determine the portions of target species (Koelerio-Corynephoretea, Festuco-Brometea species) we calculated target-species ratios (proportion of target species in comparison with the total species number; qualitative or quantitative approach: TSRqual/quant). We tested the effects of grazing, year and interactions on structural and phytodiversity characteristics of the relevés by mixed linear models. The results of the long-term experiment confirmed significant beneficial effects of grazing on habi-tat-typical structure and phytodiversity: e. g. reduction of litter, support of species which are short in height (50 cm), support of the diversity of all plant species, of non-graminoid herbs and of target plant species, reduction of Calamagrostis epigejos, positive effects on TSRqual and TSRquant values. Similar developments, e. g. for phytodiversity and Calamagrostis epigejos cover, were observed on the former fields, but there are still seed limitations and high ruderal-plant dominances. In general TSRqual/quant show remarkable increases, but do not reach the values of the Ag plots. Concerning aims of nature conservation, the habitat-typical vegetation structure and phytodiversity of the Allio-Stipetum shows an excellent development as a consequence of the used grazing manage-ment. However, occasionally small populations of target species did not increase (e. g. Koeleria glauca). The former fields show a development towards valuable sandy grassland. Allgemein gilt Beweidung als ein in der Regel wirkungsvolles Instrument für die Entwicklung von verschiedenen Vegetationstypen mit hoher Phytodiversität (Rosenthal et al. 2012). Um die Effekte der Beweidung für das Management von gefährdeten Sandrasen-Komplexen zu prüfen, untersuchten wir ein Beweidungssystem mit Schafen und zusätzlich mit Eseln im Naturschutzgebiet "Griesheimer Düne und Eichwäldchen"(nördliche Oberrheinebene, Hessen, 45 ha). Besonders bezeichnend sind hier großflächige Vorkommen des Allio-Stipetum-Vegetationskomplexes (Abb. 1, 2, 3). Das Gebiet wurde seit dem Jahre 2000 beweidet...|$|R
