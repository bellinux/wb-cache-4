40|$|For {{many decades}} the steel {{industry}} has developed on a slow but steady pace. Since 2004 the developing economies in Eastern Europe, Asia and South America radically influenced this situation. The growth in these regions was an important cause of shortages in raw material and resulting price fluctuations. Other aspects were improved logistics, speculation {{and the creation of}} global multinationals in the steel and mining industries. The local Dutch steel market evolved differently. In recent years, the market volume has shown a slow but steady decline as a result of economic, social and demographic factors as well as outsourcing and off shoring. As a result, local competition increased, causing pressure on operational margins and increasing financial risks. The current increased demand variability has a negative impact on these effects. This study aims to identify the causes and the consequences of the variability in demand that has been experienced by the Dutch steel sector. The study focuses on steel sheets and sections (beams); products which are used in different markets. Steel construction companies (SCCs) purchase steel sections for uniquely designed building projects. Steel sheet processing companies (SSPCs) are process orientated and supply a wide range of industries, often on the basis of medium term contracts. This orientation provides them with the options to hold stocks, in sharp contracts to steel companies operating in the construction sector. Second, this study aims to find solutions for the supply chain to mitigate the negative consequences of demand fluctuations. Secondary company data was analyzed to establish to what extent variability of demand in the Dutch supply chain of steel sheets and sections exists. By using a survey, the consequences for the Dutch steel sector were quantified for SCCs and SSPCs. The study identified the causes of the variability of demand by conducting a survey among a group of SCCs and SSPCs and by comparing demand data to both local and global market indicators. Finally, possible solutions were discussed with <b>steel</b> <b>processors</b> by means op in-depth unstructured interviews. The study confirms that different echelons in the supply chain inflict different levels of demand variability on their upstream suppliers. SCCs and SSPCs increase variability demand significantly, while steel distributors facilitate a smoother demand pattern for steel mills, a phenomenon known as the reversed bullwhip effect. The most important factor that influences the level of variability of demand is (expected) price fluctuations, followed by batch ordering. Price fluctuations are identified to be largely dependent on global factors. To a lesser extent they are related to local economic development. Therefore we can conclude a direct influence of global developments and globalisation on the local Dutch stele sector exists. ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1973 Four {{assumptions}} [...] 1. That {{there is}} an effective and potential demand for processed fruit products in the Western State of Nigeria. 2. That current supply of raw materials in the Western State of Nigeria is more than sufficient to meet the increased demand which the short-term addition or expansion (or both) of market opportunities as provided by processors will stimulate. 3. That farmers could be better-off economically by widening their margin. 4. That while a processing unit may have many objectives, like survival, large size, power and status, the overriding motive of the unit {{is to try to}} maximize profit. [...] were made in conducting this study which is an attempt to understand the impact a particular processing firm in the Western State of Nigeria has made on farmers in its surrounding, and a postulate of the role such firms could play in the improvement and expansion of fruit crop production, especially {{in the context of the}} stage of development Nigeria is today. With orange and pineapple as fruits of emphasis, the field work, done in Nigeria, took 59 days (July 20, 1970, to September 17, 1970); 45 days spent in interviewing farmers, 12 days in watching processing activities of 'Blaize' [...] the fruit processor; and 2 days taken off in-between. Three major issues examined are 1. The system of farming practiced by the producers [...] farmers producing for Blaize [...] particularly the farming changes (if any) induced by the addition or expansion (or both) of market opportunities as provided by the processor [...] 'Blaize'. 2. The organization, activities and program of the processor-buyer (Blaize) as they relate to the purchase of orange and pineapple from Abeokuta area. 3. The kind of relationship which has been established between the <b>processor</b> <b>firm</b> (Blaize) and farmers who supply to it. Findings are: 1. The area of land planted to orange and pineapple in Abeokuta has been increasing over the years. 2. Farmers are responsive to price incentives; and are willing to increase their productivity to take advantage of profit opportunities, but they tend to guard against a long-term curtailment of food production. 3. Farmers earn their most cash-income from farming. 4. Nonfarm activities of the present farmers provide an increasingly smaller resource potential for production increase. 5. Capital, labor, good roads and transport are major constraints on farmers' production in Abeokuta area. 6. Abeokuta farmers diversify, but they grow more crops for domestic market than for export. 7. Land-use in Abeokuta features 9. 2 percent devoted to ara-ables, 16. 3 percent to tree crops, about 11. 6 percent and 15. 4 percent devoted to orange and pineapple, respectively; and 60 percent still residual. Average land-size per farm family is 32. 7 acres, all scattered on an average of 8. 6 plots. 8. Fruit growers in Abeokuta area are market oriented. 9. People in age brackets (26 - 37) and (37 - 46), as compared with other age brackets, have the largest amount of land, are more numerous, and are more market oriented. Areas of possible further investigation are: 1. Analysis of consumer demand. 2. The difficulties which may be faced by the expansion of processed fruit products when such will be meant for exports. 3. Promotional measures, and the utilization of by-products of processing plants. 4. Analysis of the existing marketing channels and services. 5. Capacity assessment of any given processor-plant. 6.

40|$|Contractual {{breaches}} {{are very}} common in developing countries such as China. In order to prevent breaches of contract, the contractual designs between farmers and agricultural <b>processors</b> (Dragon Head <b>Firms)</b> in China are innovating in two ways: organizational innovations and contractual innovations. Due to contractual innovations, simple price-quantity contracts are evolving into complex cooperation contracts. Using data for over 500 state key processors in 2003 from the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture, we construct econometric models to study contractual choices, contract intensity, and their impacts on sales and profits for agricultural processors in China. The results indicate that capital {{and the number of}} contracted farmers are endogenous to contract choices. Processors are more likely to use cooperation contracts compared with price-quantity contracts as the number of contracted farmers increases, because the costs of coordinating, monitoring and enforcing price-quantity contracts may increase dramatically under these circumstances. On the other hand, contract types are not important for the number of contracted farmers, the intensity of contracts, or sales and profits for processors. The results also indicate that the elasticity of profits with respect to capital is 0. 52, which implies that the returns to investing in the food processing industry are relatively high in China.

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 Coastal {{communities}} in the Pacific Northwest {{are looking for ways}} to increase the diversity of their economies in order to reduce the negative impacts of cyclic economic swings. The economic base of many coastal communities is directly tied to healthy, dynamic working waterfronts through fishing, recreation, tourism, ports, and allied businesses – such as seafood processing. Seafood processing is an example of a water-dependent, value-added industry that creates local living-wage jobs and generates real income for coastal economies. Seafood <b>processors,</b> especially small <b>firms,</b> face many business challenges. They require adequate infrastructure such as accessible and well-maintained ports, efficient transportation networks, and cold storage. Seafood processors must also find ways to compete in a global seafood market. Business issues they must contend with include: •	Unpredictable fish supplies and fishery regulations. •	Increased competition from new product forms and international suppliers. •	Increased marketing complexity. This includes justifying higher product prices by developing a specialty product niche, adapting to changing consumer preferences and market drivers, and managing food safety and environmental certification issues. •	Industry consolidation and the need to work cooperatively in order to achieve the economies of scale necessary to access short supply chains. Micro-canners (small seafood canners and distributors) at the 2006 Micro-canners Conference in Astoria, Oregon suggested a project to study the feasibility of a cooperation-based business model that could help their industry expand and achieve greater success. The Community Seafood Initiative (CSI) of Astoria received grant funding for a study with the following goals: 1. 	Determine if a significant number of Pacific Northwest micro-canners believe that a cooperation-based program would help them achieve greater market share, lower business costs, increase profitability, and support business growth. 2. 	If a cooperative program is viewed favorably by micro-canners, assist them in developing and implementing the program. A cross section of the 45 + micro-canners in Oregon, Washington, and northern California were interviewed in 2007. Highlights from the survey include: •	A majority of the micro-canners interviewed indicated they would join a cooperation-based business model and contribute 1 - 2...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to model the activities of investor-owned firms (IOFs), cooperatives, and public firms in imperfect markets and observe the effects each of these types of firms has on the performance of these markets. A public firm is owned and controlled by the government. Literature generally supports public firms as procompetitive market forces, contingent on assumptions of the particular model. Classic cooperative literature reveals a controversy involving the procompetitive power of cooperatives with different membership structures. ^ The markets in this study involve producers of a raw product who sell to a processor. The processor transforms the raw product into a processed product that is then sold to consumers. Processors can be IOFs, cooperatives, or public firms. Cooperatives attempt to maximize the economic welfare of their members, while public firms attempt to maximize the welfare of the entire economy. The existence of cooperatives or public firms is expected to have a procompetitive effect on the market. To test the existence of this effect, an oligopoly/oligopsony model is developed that initially consists entirely of profit-maximizing processors. Various scenarios are developed by successively replacing investor-owned firms with cooperative or public <b>firm</b> <b>processors.</b> Several behavioral assumptions, including the conjectural variations of each type of firm, are used to determine the impact of a firm 2 ̆ 7 s output decisions. ^ Through simulation analyses on the models developed, it was determined that the existence of a competitive yardstick effect is not universal in models involving cooperatives and public firms. Models involving cooperatives that are able to set the quantity of raw product they process were most likely to tend toward a competitive equilibrium when IOFs and cooperatives hold Bertrand conjectures about cooperatives. Cooperatives that do not or cannot limit the quantity they process enhance market performance, except under an assumption of Cournot conjectures. In most scenarios, the existence of public firms enhances market performance. However, sometimes their existence had no effect at all. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we focus on}} the intertemporal aspects of {{technological}} adoption. We consider a simplified model: firms produce an homogeneous good and adoption decisions concern a cost reducing technology. We focus on the issue of industrial leadership reversal. Imagine an industry facing a sequence of cost reducing innovations; the appearance of newer generations of PC processors provides {{a good example of the}} sort of improvements we have in mind. Individual firms can upgrade by adopting the most recent improvement. This improvement comes at a cost, for example, of installing the new <b>processors.</b> Will <b>firms</b> choose to make these costly adoptions? How do adoption rates depend on the product market competition? Which adoption patterns will be sustainable in equilibrium? Will these adoption strategies reduce aggressive competition? We consider a duopoly where firms set prices, i. e. there is Bertrand competition in the product market. In an intertemporal, infinite horizon setting, firms can adopt alternative and complicated dynamic adoption strategies. We study Markov Perfect equilibria (MPE’s) and in addition restrict attention to equilibria with relatively simple but economically relevant patterns. These are: 1) Alternating adoptions and 2) Increasing asymmetry. An increasing asymmetry pattern of adoptions is such that the firm with the lowest unit cost adopts, while the high cost firm does not, so that existing cost asymmetry is reinforced. An alternating adoptions pattern is such that the firm with high unit cost adopts, while the low cost firm does not, existing cost asymmetry is reversed and leapfrogging takes place. We find that if adoption is profitable at a given date, and the price elasticity of demand is greater than, or equal to, one, then no asymmetry can be absorbing and technological adoption goes on forever through an infinite sequence of leapfroggings. For this case we characterize the adoption cost region where a pattern of alternating adoptions is an MPE. In this setting increasing asymmetry is never an MPE. Perpetual leapfrogging emerges therefore as a set of simple adoption strategies allowing implicit and sustainable coordination between two firms. Such coordination helps avoiding the most aggressive aspects of duopolistic price competition. Only with high price elasticity, and a market size large enough compared to adoption costs, this goes on forever. If adoption is profitable at a given date but the elasticity of demand is below one, there is a date in which the adoption process will stop. Alternating adoptions up to this date is an MPE for a range of adoption costs. Increasing asymmetry can also be an equilibrium in this case, but under very restrictive conditions. In an oligopolistic industry demand conditions play an essential role in determining both the continuation or the end of the technological adoption and the identity of the adopters. When adoption continues, long run technological improvements are only made by high cost firms, which emerge as the engine of productivity growth. This is mainly due to the nature of the incentives for the adoption of a new technology under Bertand competition. For any downward sloping demand function the increments in period profits, due to the adoption of a new cost reducing technology, are larger for the follower than for the leader, because market demand when the follower adopts is higher than when the leader adopts. In this last case there is, indeed, a higher equilibrium price 2. With isoelastic demand functions the value of the elasticity determines whether the adoption process will go on forever or not. With more general demand functions one would need to study the limit behaviour of the profits’ increments, due to adoption, when the equilibrium price tends to zero. Only if demand grows proportionally faster than the decrease of the price-cost margin, adoption of new technologies can go on forever. After a brief review of some related literature, the remainder of the paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we describe the model industry: market demand, technology evolution and costs, and firms’ decision sets and objective functions. In section 3 we analyse adoption decisions in a Bertrand duopoly, first with myopic firms and then with discounting. Finally section 4 contains the conclusions of the paper. All the proofs are contained in the appendix. ...|$|R
