500|$|Titanic {{held the}} record for box office gross for twelve years. Cameron's {{follow-up}} film, Avatar, was considered the first film with a genuine chance at surpassing its worldwide gross, and did so in 2010. Various explanations for why the film was able to successfully challenge Titanic were given. For one, [...] "Two-thirds of Titanic haul was earned overseas, and Avatar [...] similarly... Avatar opened in 106 markets globally and was no. 1 in all of them" [...] and the markets [...] "such as Russia, where Titanic saw modest receipts in 1997 and 1998, are white-hot today" [...] with [...] "more screens and moviegoers" [...] than ever before. Brandon Gray, president of Box Office Mojo, said that while Avatar may beat Titanic revenue record, the film is unlikely to surpass Titanic in attendance. [...] "Ticket prices were about $3 cheaper in the late 1990s." [...] In December 2009, Cameron had stated, [...] "I don't think it's realistic to try to topple Titanic off its perch. <b>Some</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> movies have {{come out in the}} last few years. Titanic just struck some kind of chord." [...] In a January 2010 interview, he gave a different take on the matter once Avatar performance was easier to predict. [...] "It's gonna happen. It's just a matter of time," [...] he said.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive reviews. Robert Canning of IGN {{gave the}} episode an 8.4/10 {{saying it was}} [...] "Impressive" [...] and [...] "With or without the timeliness {{of the story and}} setting, 'Boy Meets Curl' was a fast and funny episode certain to be a highlight of the season". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A, the best grade of the night, saying [...] "Simpsons was one of their best episodes in a long time, and it continues a season that's had <b>some</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> episodes overall. I wouldn't put this on The Simpsons' top tier, but I think it's definitely on that next tier down, episodes that maybe don't have the most original plots but do have solid jokes throughout. Even the Bart and Lisa B-plot, involving Lisa getting a sudden addiction to Olympic pin collecting, starts out kind of bland and gets better and better as Lisa's jones grows." [...] Jason Hughes of the TV Squad gave the episode a positive review as well saying [...] "All in all, it was a weird time out of Springfield this week, with some highlight moments sprinkled throughout". Steve Tilley of the Toronto Sun wrote [...] "Sure, the episode was probably funnier for Canadians and curlers (and maybe Harry Potter fans) than anyone else, but it did prove Homer has got a bit of meteorological, psychic in him: 'Pack your winter coat, we're going to Canada's warmest city!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{a review}} from Rickey.org, Nick Roman said, [...] "“Her Handsome Hero” keeps things {{interesting}} by blurring {{the lines between}} hero and villain, with Belle, Emma and even Zelena being faced with major questions about who they are, who they want to be, {{and how they can}} get out of their current situation. It's the type of episode Once Upon A Time does well, delivering a real ensemble story that keeps all the various elements of the plot moving forward. This was <b>some</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> television overall." ...|$|E

But we're {{definitely}} getting back to it. I {{think a lot of people}} appreciated the progressive nature of what we were trying to do but at the same time, a lot of people are just fucking meatheads and only want heaviness. I guess <b>some</b> bands are <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> at sticking to one thing and working that their entire career. Say ... AC/DC. But that wasn't us." ...|$|R
5000|$|The soundtrack {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews. Shahid Khan of Planet Bollywood rated it 7 out of 10 stars. He wrote [...] "Viju Shah´s [...] "Asambhav" [...] might not exactly win {{the award for}} the best soundtrack of the year but there are <b>some</b> <b>pretty</b> darn <b>good</b> tunes here." [...] Runaq Kotecha of Glamsham wrote [...] "The music of Asambhav once again confirms that Viju Shah {{is certainly one of}} the best composers that we have when it comes to delivering expeditious racy tracks with ultra modern electronic beats. However, {{in the midst of all}} the upbeat technology and heavy duty musical instruments, the tunes seem to be taking a back seat." [...] Aira of SmasHits wrote [...] "Music of 'Asambhav' is only mediocre. If heard in isolation the music lovers will probably be interested in the techno bit of the entire album." ...|$|R
60|$|After we {{had been}} a few weeks at Ludwigslust, the old Baron de Magny endeavoured to have us {{dismissed}} from the duchy; but his voice was {{not strong enough to}} overcome that of the general public, and the Chevalier de Magny especially stood our friend with his Highness when the question was debated before him. The Chevalier's love of play had not deserted him. He was a regular frequenter of our bank, where he played for <b>some</b> time with <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> luck; and where, when he began to lose, he paid with a regularity surprising to all those who knew the smallness of his means, and the splendour of his appearance.|$|R
2500|$|Lyman later recalled: [...] "From {{the first}} day, I just loved the game, {{and we had}} <b>some</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> teams, too." [...] The 1921 Nebraska team {{compiled}} a 7–1 record, lost a close game against Knute Rockne's Notre Dame team, outscored opponents by a combined total of 283 to 17, and won the Missouri Valley Conference championship. [...] The 1922 Nebraska yearbook noted the following about Lyman: [...] "Lyman was, without doubt, our fastest lineman. Roy is a big man, weighing 200 pounds, and could get down under punts almost {{as quickly as the}} ends. Roy proved to be a ground gainer on tackle-around plays before the season was over." ...|$|E
2500|$|GameSpot's Bethany Massimilla {{scored the}} game 7.7 out of 10. She was {{critical}} {{of the amount of}} Epic Scenes (which show clips from the films) in proportion to actual cutscenes; [...] "there's so much exposition being done by Gandalf that it seems to {{come at the expense of}} your characters [...] you are explicitly told what has happened and what will happen instead of actually seeing it happen, and it serves to somewhat distance the player from the whole experience." [...] However, she praised the graphics and sound, concluding [...] "The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age molds Middle-earth into a traditional turn-based frame, and while the results aren't all that great, the game carries <b>some</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> features and should appeal to fans of the source material." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I was a junkball pitcher, but I {{had a great}} knuckleball", Lee confessed. In {{her debut}} season, she {{combined}} with Wiltze (20-16, 1.88 ERA) for 31 of the 45 victories of the helpless Millerettes. The team received <b>some</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> performances from Helen Callaghan, who hit [...]287 (2nd in the league) and Faye Dancer (.274, 44 extrabases), who became the first girl to hit two home runs in a single game and two grand slams in a regular season. Playing their home games at Nicollet Park, the Millerettes could not compete with the local Minneapolis Millers. In addition, Minneapolis {{was far from the}} other five cities in the league, forcing the team to spend most of the season on the road. As a result, the team was replaced by the Fort Wayne Daisies in the 1945 season.|$|E

2500|$|According to Mr. Bungle themselves, Kiedis {{had never}} met or spoken to anyone {{involved}} with the band aside from Mike Patton. Patton stated to The A.V. Club, [...] "Our agent {{was in the process}} of booking these festivals, and it was becoming apparent that we'd landed <b>some</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> ones—one in France, another one in Holland, some big-name festivals. Turns out someone's holding a grudge! We were booted off several bills, specifically because Anthony Kiedis did not want us on the bill. He threatened to pull the Chili Peppers if Mr. Bungle was on the bill." [...] In a separate interview, he also clarified that [...] "the rest of the band doesn't care. It's something to do with Anthony." [...] Mr. Bungle's guitarist Trey Spruance added, [...] "We were booked, months in advance, to do eleven festival dates in Europe. Come Summer, we get a call from the three biggest of those festivals, all of them the same day, saying that we can't play, because the headlining band retains the right to hire and fire whomever they wish. We found out it was the Red Hot Chili Peppers, so our manager called their manager to find out what the hell was going on, and their manager was very apologetic, and said, 'We're really sorry, we want you to know this doesn't reflect the management's position, or the band's for that matter, it's Anthony Kiedis who wants this.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Singer Mike Patton {{was known}} {{to have had a}} bad {{relationship}} with the Red Hot Chili Peppers' frontman Anthony Kiedis, beginning when Kiedis saw Patton performing with Faith No More and accused him of imitating his style. California was scheduled to be released on June 8, 1999, but Warner Bros. Records pushed it back so as not to coincide with the Red Hot Chili Peppers similarly titled album, Californication, which was to be released on the same day. Following the album release date clash, Kiedis had Mr. Bungle removed from a series of summer festivals in Europe; as the headlining act at the festivals, The Red Hot Chili Peppers had final word on the bands that would appear. According to the band members themselves, Kiedis had never met or spoken to anyone involved with Mr. Bungle aside from Mike Patton. Patton explained to The A.V. Club, [...] "Our agent {{was in the process of}} booking these festivals, and it was becoming apparent that we'd landed <b>some</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> ones—one in France, another one in Holland, some big-name festivals.

40|$|Let G be a graph with {{adjacency}} matrix A. The transition matrix of G relative to A {{is defined by}} H(t) :=(-itA), t∈. The graph G is said to admit <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> state transfer between a pair of vertices u and v if there exists a sequence of real numbers {t_k} and a complex number γ of unit modulus such that _k→∞ H(t_k) e_u=γ e_v.

In addition, we look for <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> state transfer in more general circulant graphs. We prove that union (edge disjoint) of an integral circulant graph with a cycle, each on 2 ^k (k≥ 3) vertices, admits <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> state transfer.
