60|$|No wonder, then, {{that they}} hurled {{themselves}} despairingly upon the stubborn doors. For {{an hour or}} more they laboured, but all in vain. The massive timbers of hard wood, six inches or more in thickness, could scarcely be touched by their knives and spears, nor might their united strength serve even to stir the <b>stone</b> <b>bolts</b> and bars that held them fast, and they had nothing that {{could be used as a}} battering-ram.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now a ship {{coming in}} to land men must furl her sail. If you {{wait till you see}} her men gather up the sail's foot, your catapults can jerk a net of loose <b>stones</b> (<b>bolts</b> only cut through the cloth) into the bag of it. Then she turns over, and the sea makes {{everything}} clean again. A few men may come ashore, but very few. ... It was not hard work, except the waiting on the beach in blowing sand and snow. And that was how we dealt with the Winged Hats that winter.|$|R
50|$|On the day Jiawu {{the king}} went to hunt a rhinoceros. The {{carriage}} of courtier Chu broke its axis. A gelding tripped over <b>stones</b> and <b>bolted</b> {{away from the}} king's carriage. Prince Yang also fell down.|$|R
5000|$|... {{has three}} pairs of <b>stones,</b> a <b>Bolting</b> Mill, Rubble Machine and Smut Machine, with {{extensive}} Lofts; they are driven by a very powerful stream affording a never-failing supply of water and are capable of making at least one hundred sacks a week.|$|R
5000|$|A coup d'état {{takes place}} and General Kamijo's son takes over, {{while in the}} {{laboratory}} Naito reveals that Neo Cells are not what they seem. The Neo Cells were acquired from the slaughtered [...] "original humans" [...] of Zone Seven {{for the purposes of}} prolonging General Kamijo and his cohorts' lives, and the Neo Cell culture did not in fact create the Neo-Sapiens. It simply rejoined the body parts that were harvested from the victims of Zone Seven after being struck by the <b>stone</b> lightning <b>bolt.</b> Even though Dr. Azuma had been spearheading the macabre experiments, he is unable to explain what has happened. As they talk, the <b>stone</b> lightning <b>bolt</b> crumbles and Casshern appears to fall from the sky into the laboratory, which is now in ruins.|$|R
5000|$|Every {{physical}} {{component of}} the Monument is local. Even the rock {{was taken from the}} nearby French River. All of the machinery and equipment was donated by miners or the mines. 2 The mucker, the ladder and even the batteries on the miner's belts are authentic. Further, even the bolts that are used to hold the Monument together are <b>stone</b> <b>bolts</b> taken from a mine. [...] 3 It was important that everything was local and authentic because the Miners’ Monument Foundation wanted the Monument to show as accurately as possible {{what it was like to}} work underground and to make the monument as ‘human’ and ‘warm’ as possible. 2The monument was not supposed to be a cold monolith embodying only the danger of underground work, and it is instead a memorial infused with the miners’ experiences.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} my sister that thou art here," [...] said she, and away she {{ran from the}} little <b>stone</b> hallway, {{carefully}} <b>bolting</b> and locking the further door behind her.|$|R
25|$|The entrenched Roman legions {{were then}} pitched {{in a battle}} against the Macedonian style phalanx troops in the centre with missile support {{in the form of}} <b>stones</b> and <b>bolts</b> coming from the rear. The phalanx, unable to put up a full charge, engaged the Roman legions. Despite this, the Romans still had to contend against pike phalanx units with their own short swords. In order for the troops to use their short-sword they had to swat away the {{opposing}} pikes with their bare hands before drawing themselves near enough to attack.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The catapults of the Wall--huge things {{forty feet}} high to the head--firing nets of raw <b>stone</b> or forged <b>bolts.</b> Nothing can stand against them. He left us our catapults at last, {{but he took}} a Cæsar's half of our men without pity. We were a shell when he rolled up the lists! ...|$|R
50|$|After eight summers of digging, about 200 artifacts, some 600 {{pieces of}} strike waste, {{scrapers}} and <b>bolt</b> <b>stone,</b> and heated stones {{from an open}} fire have been found. The objects are made of various materials, including siltstone, quartz, quartzite, volcanic rock, jasper and sandstone; as siltstone and quartzite do not occur naturally in the area, {{at least some of}} these must have come from elsewhere.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, that <b>stone</b> was the <b>bolt,</b> Bertie. You see it {{was pushed}} up, and the door then closed; and when the stone was exactly in its place, it would drop into the hole and keep it from moving, and nothing short of {{breaking}} up the bolt would give an entrance. It is lucky {{that we did not}} push it quite to; another quarter of an inch and that bolt would have fallen, and we could not have moved it unless by smashing the whole thing into bits. That was why they did not quite close the stone; they wanted to get in again." ...|$|R
50|$|Miners {{began their}} strike in late May 2012. The strike has {{included}} attacks on police and {{offices of the}} ruling People's Party. Miners attacked police with rockets, <b>stones,</b> nuts and <b>bolts,</b> and blocked up to 60 roads a day including 16 main roads and motorways and two railway lines. Miners also occupied a mineshaft and erected barricades made from burning tyres. The Civil Guard and riot police used tear gas, baton charges and rubber bullets. In June 2012, a rail passenger was injured when the train on which he was travelling collided with tree trunks placed on the tracks.|$|R
60|$|The {{night was}} a terrible one. The <b>bolts,</b> <b>stones,</b> and arrows which passed over the wall spread ruin and death over the town. The din was unceasing. The thundering noise of the great stones; the dull, deep sound as the ram struck the wall; the fierce shouts of the combatants, as they fought hand to hand--for the corpses were, in places, piled so thick that the assailants could mount upon them {{to the top of}} the walls--the shrieks of the women, and the screams of the children, {{combined}} in one terrible and confused noise; which was echoed back, and multiplied, by the surrounding mountains.|$|R
500|$|Repairs of the {{earthquake}} damage began in 1908, despite misgivings from some university administration regarding its cost. The church and the Old Chemistry building {{were the only two}} buildings in the university's Inner Quad that were repaired. [...] The extent of the damage was such that the church had to be completely rebuilt. The entire church, except for its surviving crossing structure and offices, was dismantled stone by stone, which, along with the windows, were labelled and stored. [...] "To assure permanence" [...] in case of further earthquakes, the masonry was anchored to its thick, concrete-reinforced walls. [...] The <b>stones</b> were securely <b>bolted</b> to each other, [...] "making the whole structure practically one massive hollow rock on a great steel foundation skeleton". [...] The tile floor was replaced with cork. [...] The building's crossing received a tiled hipped roof and an oculus, which lit the interior of the church, and was added above the renovated dome, which had a frescoed ceiling decorated with bronze designs as opposed to the gold leaf present before {{the earthquake}}. [...] The original rose window above the front facade was replaced with one with a simpler arch shape because it was more similar to the style {{of the rest of the}} buildings in the Inner Quad.|$|R
6000|$|At length, {{having left}} {{more than two-thirds}} of their brave companions behind them, the yeomanry {{attained}} the point, which, being commanded by arrows and engines from the battlements, might be considered as that of comparative safety. A volley of large <b>stones,</b> and square-headed <b>bolts</b> of great size and thickness, effectually stopped the farther progress of the pursuit, and those who had led it drew back their desultory forces to the plain, where, with shouts of jubilee and exultation, their countrymen were employed in securing the plunder of the field; while some, impelled by hatred and revenge, mangled and mutilated the limbs of the dead Normans, in a manner unworthy of their national cause and their own courage. The fearful yells with which this dreadful work was consummated, while it struck horror into the minds of the slender garrison of the Garde Doloureuse, inspired them at the same time with the resolution rather to defend the fortress to the last extremity, than to submit to the mercy of so vengeful an enemy. [Footnote: This is by no means exaggerated in the text. A very honourable testimony was given to their valour by King Henry II., {{in a letter to the}} Greek Emperor, Emanuel Commenus. This prince having desired that an account might be sent him of all that was remarkable in the island of Great Britain, Henry, in answer to that request, was pleased to take notice, among other particulars, of the extraordinary courage and fierceness of the Welsh, who were not afraid to fight unarmed with enemies armed at all points, valiantly shedding their blood in the cause of their country, and purchasing glory at the expense of their lives.] ...|$|R
