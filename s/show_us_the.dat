The stories share a common theme, namely that Gladwell tries to <b>show</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> world {{through the eyes of}} others, even if that other happens to be a dog.|$|E

[...] Citing participants' independent efforts to coordinate teams {{using a variety of}} online platforms, Stein suggested that [...] "GISHWHES may lack the overt language of industrial reconfiguration found in the Divine Kickstarter Project [...] But through its satire and dadaist play, it more fully models the potential for a congregation of authors, both official and unofficial, to direct fannish and creative investment into digital participation." [...] Stein further argued that [...] "decentralized projects like Gishwhes, with creators who fully immerse themselves in the surrounding digital cultures, <b>show</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> potential for future transmedia creative authorship in millennial culture." ...|$|E

500|$|The villain in the story, Mad Wayne, {{had been}} dealt a bad hand in life. Because of his situation, he acts on his bad impulses. Carter elaborated, [...] "Is it fate that Wayne is about, the character, {{this is what}} I was {{interested}} in exploring here. As we'll see with the introduction {{in a moment of}} a character who throws all of this into question – God – we're going to see what his place is in all of this, or at least explore what Burt Reynolds, playing God here, {{has to do with the}} character Wayne." [...] The main idea behind the episode, was that God knows all the numbers, because they are his numbers and he is laying them down and is in [...] "charge of the big game". Being that God is trying to <b>show</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> game, as it was a [...] "game" [...] to be [...] "won or lost", and Wayne has lost this game.|$|E
500|$|Advertisements {{are used}} to attract {{customers}} to a business’ products or services. In doing so, they are also making statements regarding race, social class, gender, values, and [...] family. They not only describe these social categories, they prescribe behaviors or show one {{how it is that}} they should act in accordance with social ideals or norms. According to Belk and Pollay, “not only do [...] <b>show</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> ideal life, they instruct us [...] how to live.” Through targeting specific groups of people for products and services, advertisements both reflect changes of social norms and are changers of social norms regarding acceptable behavior. Some argue that the image of family only plays a symbolic role by reflecting the current cultural values. Advertisements may not only reflect changes in social norms, but also be asserting that such behavior is acceptable. As a result, sociologists have challenged the public to study ads containing images of the family not just as marketing messages but also as vehicles for behavior and attitudes towards society.|$|E
500|$|... "Three Men and Adena" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews and}} {{has been described as}} one of the [...] "classic episodes" [...] of Homicide: Life on the Street. [...] "Three Men and Adena" [...] ranked number 74 in an Entertainment Weekly list of the 100 greatest television moments, and number 15 among the top television moments from the 1990s. It was also identified by The Baltimore Sun as one of the ten best episodes of the series. Sun writer David Zurawik said Fontana's playwriting background was deeply infused in the episode, which he called a [...] "landmark hour" [...] that it [...] "put (three men) and a few sticks of battle-scarred, municipal-green furniture and somehow managed to <b>show</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> human soul and the heart of darkness". Additionally, [...] "Three Men and Adena" [...] was among a 1999 Court TV marathon of the top 15 Homicide episodes, as voted on by 20,000 visitors to the channels website. David Bianculli of the New York Daily News said the episode [...] "remains one of TV's best drama hours ever", and he ranked it the second-best television episode ever made, behind the Taxi episode where Reverend Jim gets his driver's license. Entertainment Weekly writer Bruce Fretts said the episode was [...] "one of the most powerful prime-time hours ever" [...] and called Andre Braugher's performance a [...] "tour de police force". Alex Strachan of The Vancouver Sun described [...] "Three Men and Adena" [...] as [...] "one of Homicides finest moments". He called the episode [...] "claustrophobic, cynical and ultimately painful" [...] and particularly praised the performances of Braugher and Secor, {{and the fact that it}} was not a happy ending. David P. Kalat, writer of Homicide: Life on the Street: The Unofficial Companion, described the episode as [...] "an astonishing tour de force of writing and acting that demonstrates all of Homicides best qualities". He also praised the chemistry between Braugher and Secor, particularly when they found a common voice during the interrogation.|$|E

500|$|Benedict de Spinoza in his Ethics, {{published}} {{after his}} death in 1677, argued that most people, even those that consider themselves to exercise free will, make moral decisions on the basis of imperfect sensory information, inadequate understanding of their mind and will, as well as emotions which are both outcomes of their contingent physical existence and forms of thought defective from being chiefly impelled by self-preservation. The solution, according to Spinoza, was to gradually increase the capacity of our reason to change the forms of thought produced by emotions and {{to fall in love with}} viewing problems requiring moral decision from the perspective of eternity. Thus, living a life of peaceful conscience means to Spinoza that reason is used to generate adequate ideas where the mind increasingly sees the world and its conflicts, our desires and passions sub specie aeternitatis, that is without reference to time. Hegel's obscure and mystical Philosophy of Mind held that the absolute right of freedom of conscience facilitates human understanding of an all-embracing unity, an absolute which was rational, real and true. Nevertheless, Hegel thought that a functioning State would always be tempted not to recognize conscience in its form of subjective knowledge, just as similar non-objective opinions are generally rejected in science. A similar idealist notion was expressed in the writings of Joseph Butler who argued that conscience is God-given, should always be obeyed, is intuitive, and should be considered the [...] "constitutional monarch" [...] and the [...] "universal moral faculty": [...] "conscience does not only offer itself to <b>show</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> way we should walk in, but it likewise carries its own authority with it." [...] Butler advanced ethical speculation by referring to a duality of regulative principles in human nature: first,"self-love" [...] (seeking individual happiness) and second, [...] "benevolence" [...] (compassion and seeking good for another) in conscience (also linked to the agape of situational ethics). Conscience tended to be more authoritative in questions of moral judgment, thought Butler, because it was more likely to be clear and certain (whereas calculations of self-interest tended to probable and changing conclusions). John Selden in his Table Talk expressed the view that an awake but excessively scrupulous or ill-trained conscience could hinder resolve and practical action; it being [...] "like a horse that is not well wayed, he starts at every bird that flies out of the hedge".|$|E

2500|$|Of all {{the players}} on the Dodgers roster, general manager Bavasi {{believed}} that the key Dodger of the upcoming 1961 season was Demeter, expecting Don to make a large comeback after his disappointing outing last season. [...] "If Don can <b>show</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> Demeter of early 1959, we won't have to look for added power. We'll have all we need." [...] It was announced on February 14, 1961, that Demeter had signed his new yearly contract with the Dodgers for around $16,000. However, Don would have stiff competition to regain his starting role in center field. Newcomer Willie Davis, coming off a huge season in the Pacific Coast League and last season's number one player of the year as named by The Sporting News, was considered a serious threat to take Demeter's job. By the start of the season, Demeter had his role reduced to coming off the bench.|$|E

However, in King's 1981 nonfiction book Danse Macabre, he listed Kubrick's film among those he considered to have [...] "contributed something of value to the [...] genre" [...] and mentioned it as one of his [...] "personal favorites". Before the 1980 movie King often said he gave little attention to the film adaptations of his work.|$|E
