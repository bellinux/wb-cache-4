Valves are actuated by the camshaft through hardened followers, push rods, and rocker arms. The 500 cc and 600 cc models are equipped with Bing slide-type carburetors with 26 mm throats.

Since there are multiple CPU cores to run the multiple processes (both the applications and the TFSs), and the four partitions are accessible in parallel (the four controllers permit this), the processing capacity is four times larger than with a single-core, <b>single-disk,</b> and single-partition configuration.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In modern {{parallel}} storage systems (e. g., cloud storage and data centers), {{it is important}} to provide data availability guarantees against disk (or storage node) failures via redundancy coding schemes. One coding scheme is X-code, which is double-fault tolerant while achieving the optimal update complexity. When a disk/node fails, recovery must be carried out to reduce the possibility of data unavailability. We propose an X-code-based optimal recovery scheme called Minimum-Disk-Read-Recovery (MDRR), which minimizes the number of disk reads for <b>single-disk</b> failure recovery. We make several contributions. First, we show that MDRR provides optimal <b>single-disk</b> failure recovery and reduces about 25 % of disk reads compared to the conventional recovery approach. Second, we prove that any optimal recovery scheme for X-code cannot balance disk reads among different disks within a single stripe in general cases. Third, we propose an efficient logical encoding scheme that issues balanced disk read in a group of stripes for any recovery algorithm (including the MDRR scheme). Finally, we implement our proposed recovery schemes and conduct extensive testbed experiments in a networked storage system prototype. Experiments indicate that MDRR reduces around 20 % of recovery time of the conventional approach, showing that our theoretical findings are applicable in practice.

This structure is characteristic of the so-called elephant mode of Pier & Huerre (J. Fluid Mech. vol. 435, 2001, p. 145). The global bifurcation is subcritical since only large-amplitude initial perturbations are found to trigger the elephant mode. Small-amplitude perturbations induce a long-lasting transient growth but lead eventually to a damped linear global mode, showing that non-parallel effects counteract the absolute instability and restabilize the flow. A similar linear global stabilization due to non-parallel effects has been found {{in the case of the}} flow above a single rotating disk. For the <b>single-disk</b> geometry, the existence of an elephant mode would imply, together with results of Davies & Carpenter (2003) a subcritical global instability, which has not yet been demonstrated.

The assessment of a medium aspect ratio elongated liquid nitrogen edge cooled, <b>single-disk</b> sapphire window has shown, {{that the use of}} an elliptical rf beam with flattened power distribution and an aspect ratio of 8 : 1 (252 mm x 32 mm window aperture) or of a ring-shaped elliptical beam with an aspect ratio of 3 : 1 (156 mm x 52 mm) allows a power transmission capability of 1 MW, CW at 170 GHz. Finite element calculations on stress distribution at 5 bar overpressure show that all stresses are well below the admissible limits. A principle design of the window assembly is presented. Finite element calculations on a liquid neon edge cooled, <b>single-disk</b> sapphire window using pessimistic values of loss tangent and thermal conductivity give a CW power transmission capability for a Gaussian/HE_ 1 _ 1 -power distribution of 2. 8 MW, 2. 3 MW and 1. 8 MW at 140 GHz, 170 GHz and 220 GHz, respectively, allowing even 2 MW, CW windows at 170 GHz. Calculations on stress distribution (5 bar overpressure) and a final principle design were done. Finite element calculations on a large aspect ratio rectangular Brewster window (680 mm x 12 mm) with water edge cooling at 293 K show that Au-doped silicon and PACVD diamond are possible candidates for CW operation around 170 GHz. Diamond is preferable since there is no danger of enhanced losses due to thermal excitation of charge carriers at temperatures higher than 350 K. The final design of the window assembly is presented. The total losses of the assembly (7. 3 %) can be reduced to approximately 3 % by using periodically rippled wall mode converters to generate the 90 % HE_ 1 _ 1 / 10 % HE_ 1 _ 2 (in phase) mode mixture for optimum coupling to the free-space Gaussian mode.

METHODS: Seventeen patients with cardiac prosthetic thrombosis diagnosed by clinical, echocardiographic, and radioscopic findings underwent fibrinolytic treatment with a streptokinase bolus of 250, 000 U followed by 100. 000 U/hour. Short- and long-term results were assessed by radioscopy and echocardiography. RESULTS: Of the 17 patients, 12 had mechanical double-disk prostheses (4 aortic, 6 mitral, 2 tricuspid), 4 had <b>single-disk</b> prostheses (2 aortic, 1 mitral, and 1 tricuspid), and 1 had a tricuspid bioprosthesis. The success rate was 64. 8 %, the partial success rate was 17. 6 %, and the nonsuccess rate was 17. 6 %. All patients with a double-disk prosthesis responded, completely or partially, to the treatment. None of the patients with a <b>single-disk</b> prosthesis had complete resolution of the thrombosis. The time of streptokinase infusion ranged from 6 to 80 hours (mean of 56 h). The mortality rate due to the use of streptokinase was 5. 8 % and was secondary to cerebral bleeding.

Concurrency can be introduced by overlapping I/O requests at different disks, and the average service time can be reduced by reading several blocks on each I/O operation. However, a RAM-based cache is required to support this prefetching. A prefetching strategy is proposed in which one block from each run is read on every I/O operation, and a Markov model is developed to analyze the dynamic behavior of the system. The steady-state probabilities and a closed-form expression for the average parallelism are derived as functions of the cache size {{and the number of}} runs.
