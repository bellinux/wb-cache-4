40|$|Previously, Northern Italian, Dutch, {{and then}} English {{entrepreneurs}} had dominated global trade in turn, and when after {{a century or}} so their respective hegemonies began to show cracks, each group refocused its efforts {{in the service of}} tapping already-accumulated wealth through financial speculation and, in the process, also financed the rise of their successors. 20 If Dahrendorf was correct, and American capital was managed during the era of American industrial dominance by “a class of career bureaucrats, whose primary loyalty lay with their employer rather than with a class of property owners,” 21 there are good reasons to believe that that has ceased to be the case. “Property owners,” meaning in the American case those who control and stand to benefit from financial activity (leaving aside the question as to whether <b>shares</b> <b>of</b> <b>corporate</b> <b>stock</b> should be defined as “property”), have absorbed these onetime “career bureaucrats” into their ranks.
