Different from the six traditional degrees of freedom, which {{can be understood as}} a representation of rigid-body movement at one node, the <b>seventh</b> degree of <b>freedom</b> indicates deformation at the node itself.|$|R

Then President Nelson Mandela appeared on the balcony of South Africa House in 1995, as part of his official state visit. In 2001, Mandela again appeared on the balcony of South Africa House to mark the <b>seventh</b> anniversary of <b>Freedom</b> Day, when the system of Apartheid ended.|$|R
50|$|After the Montenegrin {{independence}} referendum, Serbia {{became an}} international market for Montenegrin companies. Montenegro Airlines had to cease international flights from Serbia to countries other than Montenegro, thus losing the profitable Niš - Zurich line, {{due to lack}} of <b>Seventh</b> <b>Freedom</b> policy. In an effort to circumvent this, Montenegro Airlines registered a separate airline in Serbia called Master Airways, but it was denied an operating license allegedly due to Serbian Government protectionist policies.On July 23, 2007, Montenegro Airlines ordered 2 Embraer 195 in order to grow its fleet and destination network. The aircraft being leased from GECAS for a period of 8 years. The first of the two Embraer E-195s arrived at Podgorica Airport on 5 June 2008. The delivery of the first Embraer was followed by introduction of regular flights to London-Gatwick and Milan-Malpensa International Airport.|$|E
40|$|Laboratory Telerobotic Manipulator (LTM) is seven-degree-of-freedom {{robot arm}} built for {{evaluation}} in ground-based research to assess role of redundant-degree-of-freedom arms in outerspace operations. Each arm has three pitch/yaw joints: one at shoulder, another at elbow, and third at wrist. <b>Seventh</b> degree of <b>freedom</b> provided by wrist-roll joint. Offers advantages of more {{efficient use of}} workspaces and ability to reach around obstacles, redundant manipulators used in mobile robots and teleoperators for hazardous environments, automotive assembly, welding, and spray painting...|$|R
40|$|Navigation and {{interaction}} in stereoscopic virtual environments with head-tracking for very large data sets present several challenges beyond those encountered with smaller or monoscopic data sets. First, zooming by approaching or retreating from a target must be augmented by integrating scale as a <b>seventh</b> degree of <b>freedom.</b> Second, {{in order to}} maintain good stereoscopic imagery, the interface must: maintain stereo image pairs that the user perceives as a single 3 D image, minimize loss of perceived depth since stereoscopic imagery cannot properly occlude the screen's frame, provide maximum depth information, and place objects at distances where they are best manipulated. Finally, the navigation interface must work when the environment is displayed at any scale. This paper addresses these problems for god's-eye-view or third person navigation of a specific large-scale virtual environment: a high-resolution terrain database covering an entire planet...|$|R
50|$|In {{general the}} trajectories {{calculated}} from the motion planning algorithms are robot like, i.e. clipped and jerky. In order to enhance this and make {{the movement of the}} manipulator more pleasant to the user the trajectories are smoothed and the quality is enhanced. Therefore, the used robot arm is helpful. Since six degrees of freedom are sufficient to define a 3D pose in the environment (three degrees for position and three degrees for orientation) and FRIEND's manipulator has seven degrees of freedom, one degree of freedom can be chosen optional, i.e. the manipulator can turn its elbow joint by 360 degrees without changing gripper's pose. This can be used to find the best trajectory from a start to a goal configuration among an infeasible set of possible configurations. This <b>seventh</b> degree of <b>freedom</b> is also used to solve and avoid dead-locks during the motion process and to keep a minimal distance to obstacles.|$|R
40|$|Panel 212. Contextual {{changes in}} higher {{education}} - SIG: Higher EducationConference Theme: Ubuntu! Imagining a Humanist Education GloballyThis paper examines the complex relationships between politics, academic freedom and civic engagement of academics in Hong Kong after its sovereignty was returned from the United Kingdom to China in 1997. Numerous works have examined the concepts and issues of individual academic freedom and university autonomy (as collective academic freedom), and proposed {{that they can be}} bipartite: universal across cultures and particularistic in specific cultures. Many other studies have investigated the third mission of higher education (after research and teaching) in equipping students (particularly undergraduate students) with the necessary civic literacy, competence and attitudes for civic engagement. Academics’ civic engagement and its relationship to academic freedom, however, is under-researched; this warrants attention. Using documentary analysis as the major methodology, the paper critically examines the dynamics and complexities of academics’ struggles over the issues of academic freedom and civic engagement in Hong Kong under Chinese sovereignty. Specifically, it analyses six major incidents which were or were perceived as threats to academic freedom or university autonomy since 1997. Two incidents were related to the local (Hong Kong) government, and the other four to the new local-central (China) relationships after 1997. The analysis reveals eight major findings. First, these incidents shared two major similarities: government intolerance of criticism and involvement of academics as active citizens in participating in public affairs by sharing their views with the government and the community at large. Second, these incidents differed in terms of the types of actors who infringed upon or were suspected to threaten the freedom and autonomy of academics and universities and how the latter handled the incident. Third, the understanding of academic freedom on an individual or collective basis can be extended from bipartite to tripartite, with global/universal, national and local components. Fourth, academic freedom and the dissemination of academic views and research findings are not borderless, but bordered, depending on production sites and dissemination outlets. Fifth, threats to academic freedom and university autonomy can take the form of disagreements about the merits of the research, either external or internal in origin. Sixth, the mass media can play two contrasting roles in university-government-society relationships: a major protector safeguarding the freedom and autonomy of individual academics and universities as institutions, and a dangerous powerful force intimidating and suppressing individual academics’ freedom to express their criticisms and civic engagement in public affairs that the authorities do not like. <b>Seventh,</b> academic <b>freedom</b> is an extension of society’s core rights of freedom of expression and publication to the realms of academia and not vice versa, and therefore can offer very limited protection to faculty and students in active civic engagement such as civil disobedience. Eighth, universities can {{play an important role in}} protecting academics and students who engage in active civic engagement. The paper contributes to the field of comparative and international education with particular focus on higher education, academic freedom and civic engagement of academics in two aspects. First, it provides a useful case showing both how change of sovereignty and change of local-central relationship under the same sovereignty can affect the understanding and practice of academic freedom and university autonomy. Second, the paper adds to the theoretical understanding of dynamics and complexities of relationships between academic freedom and civic engagement...|$|R
