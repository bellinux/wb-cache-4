Technology of interval and purposive regulation of cuts speed is used at most humps. The article discusses ways to reduce the cuts rolling speed to a safe level {{at the beginning of the}} sorting sidings equipped with quasi-continuous speed control system. Methodology. It proposed three fundamentally different ways to reduce the cuts rolling speed at the beginning of the <b>sorting</b> <b>siding.</b> The analysis of the ways to reduce cuts rolling speed to a safe level at the beginning of the sorting sidings was conducted using simulation the process of cuts rolling from humps equipped with quasi-continuous speed control. Findings. As a result of analysis, the inappropriateness of opposite elevation using on the roll-out part of the hump after the last separation switch point. Spot regulators of cars speed can be used to reduce the cuts rolling speed at the beginning of the <b>sorting</b> <b>siding,</b> but this leads to a division conditions deterioration on the last separating switch points of long cuts with the following after them short cuts. Reducing the cuts rolling speed at the beginning of the <b>sorting</b> <b>siding</b> can be carried out using the beam on a stationary wagon retarders park brake position. Control Algorithm park brake position is quite simple. All produce should be unhooked from it at a safe speed. If the accuracy of the implementation of the set speed output to unhook from the park brake position is low, it is possible to eliminate the error of point regulators cars speed. Originality. The question where to start location point of wagon retarders zone to reduce speed to cut level requires additional research. Reducing rolling cut the speed at the beginning of the sorting sidings can be carried out using the beam on a stationary wagon retarders park brake position. Practical value. Control Algorithm park brake position is quite simple. All produce should be cut from it at a safe speed. If the accuracy of the implementation of the set speed output to cut from the park brake position is low, it is possible to eliminate the error of point regulators cars speed. ...|$|E

40|$|Colonic {{epithelial}} {{stem cells}} {{are believed to be}} located at the crypt base where they have previously been shown to express musashi- 1. The colonic stem cell niche, which includes extracellular matrix and myofibroblasts (together with other cell types), is likely to be important in maintaining the function of the progenitor cells. The aims of our studies were to characterize stem cells in isolated and disaggregated human colonic crypt epithelial cells and investigate their interactions with monolayers of primary human colonic myofibroblasts. In unfractionated preparations of disaggregated colonic crypts, musashi- 1 positive cells preferentially adhered to colonic myofibroblasts, despite the presence of excess blocking anti-β 1 -integrin antibody. These adherent epithelial cells remained viable for a number of days and developed slender processes. Cells with side population characteristics (as demonstrated by ability to expel the dye Hoechst 33342) were consistently seen in the isolated colonic crypt epithelial cells. These side population cells expressed musashi- 1, β 1 -integrin, BerEP 4, and CD 133. <b>Sorted</b> <b>side</b> population crypt epithelial cells also rapidly adhered to primary colonic myofibroblasts. In conclusion, in preparation of isolated and disaggregated human colonic crypts, cells with stem cell characteristics preferentially adhere to primary human colonic myofibroblasts in a β 1 -integrin-independent fashion...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Purifying {{stem cells}} is an {{inevitable}} process for further investigation and cell-therapy. <b>Sorting</b> <b>side</b> population (SP) cells is {{generally regarded as}} an effective method to enrich for progenitor cells. This {{study was to explore}} whether sorting SP could enrich for the Musashi 1 (Msi 1) positive cells from Msi 1 high expression cells (Msi 1 high cells) derived from mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in vitro. Results In this study, Msi 1 high cell population derived from ESCs were stained by Hoechst 33342, and then the SP and non-SP (NSP) fractions were analyzed and sorted by fluorescence activated cell sorter. Subsequently, the expressions of Msi 1 and other markers for neural and intestinal stem cells in SP and NSP were respectively detected. SP and NSP cells were hypodermically engrafted into the backs of NOD/SCID mice to form grafts. The developments of neural and intestinal epithelial cells in these grafts were investigated. SP fraction was identified and isolated from Msi 1 high cell population. The expression of Msi 1 in SP fraction was significantly higher than that in NSP fraction and unsorted Msi 1 high cells (P P Conclusions SP fraction, isolated from Msi 1 high cells, contains almost all the Msi 1 -positive cells and has the potential to differentiate into neural and intestinal epithelial cells in vivo. Sorting SP fraction could be a convenient and practical method to enrich for Msi 1 -positive cells from the differentiated cell population derived from ESCs. </p...|$|R

40|$|Activation of Notch {{signaling}} pathway in cancer stem cells plays {{a crucial role}} in the regulation of self–renewal and maintenance of side population cells. In the present study, we have identified cancer stem like 2. 7 % side population cells from nasopharyngeal carcinoma samples whose prevalence was signifi-cantly reduced to 0. 3 % upon verapamil treatment. The protein level of Notch 1 and Hes- 1 are highly up-regulated in fluorescence-activated cell <b>sorting</b> purified <b>side</b> population cells and thus leads to the elevated expression of stem cell surface proteins (Oct- 4, Sox 2 and Nanog), which are essential for side population cells self-renewal. In addition, these nasopharyngeal carcinoma side population cells are CD 133 and CD 44 positive and they possess enhanced cell proliferation rate, highly tumorgenic and invasive. Our findings suggest that Notch 1 signaling is a potential target of novel anticancer drugs, which could efficiently target and eradicate the cancer stem cells...|$|R
