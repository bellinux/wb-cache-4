60|$|I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> {{dismissed}} him. After a {{very brief}} toilet I hastened downstairs.|$|E
60|$|I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> {{felt myself}} {{swelling}} with the inarticulate hate that possessed me.|$|E
60|$|Again I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> for {{the life}} of me I could say nothing.|$|E
6000|$|I removed them gently, {{returned}} them, <b>and</b> walked away, <b>shaking</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> smiling a {{smile of}} silly embarrassment while the passers-by halted to observe. The woman leaned out of her door, shook the beads, and screamed after me: ...|$|R
60|$|I {{released}} her long emaciated hand, <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> negatively, <b>and</b> sat down.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I couldn't speak, I {{could only}} <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> Boney--so {{impatient}} {{he was to}} go on with his doings--he ran at me and fair pushed me out of the room. And that was all there was to it.' Pharaoh stood up and slid his fiddle into one of his big skirt-pockets {{as though it were a}} dead hare.|$|R
60|$|I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> {{looked at}} him. His head had dropped {{down on his}} chest again.|$|E
60|$|I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> I smiled {{down upon}} her {{a smile that}} was very full of confidence.|$|E
60|$|I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> {{paused in}} the act of dislodging the {{shavings}} which had drifted down my neck.|$|E
60|$|Then, at a {{sign from}} the Prince, {{soldiers}} flung themselves upon the miserable Umbezi {{and dragged him}} thence, Saduko going with them; nor was the poor liar ever seen again. As he passed by me he called to me, for Mameena's sake, to save him; but I could only <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> bethink me of the warning I had once given to him as {{to the fate of}} traitors.|$|R
6000|$|I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> impatiently, <b>and</b> {{collecting}} myself, I said, {{very slowly}} and somewhat unsteadily, [...] "Do you suspect {{me of being}} instrumental in taking it?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The episode {{received}} {{an audience of}} 3.56 million, making it the third-most watched show on Fox that night behind Brooklyn Nine-Nine and The Simpsons episode, [...] "Cue Detective". Lisa Babick of TV Fanatic gave the episode 3.0 of 5.0 stars, noting [...] "I spent more time <b>shaking</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> rolling <b>my</b> eyes than I did laughing during Family Guy Season 14 Episode 2. And the only times I did laugh was when Stewie was on the screen." ...|$|R
60|$|I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> {{said that}} I could not, and next moment was sorry, for she {{proceeded}} to explain.|$|E
60|$|I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> {{answered}} her vaguely. She sent {{a boy with}} a message, and brought me out a chair, dusting it carefully with her apron.|$|E
60|$|I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> {{replied that}} I had been idling {{long enough and}} must try to make some money, news at which he seemed very disappointed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Gentlemen {{have often}} asked me that," [...] said Moodie slowly; [...] "but I <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> say little or nothing, and creep {{out of the}} way as well as I can. I am a man of few words; and if gentlemen were to be told one thing, they would be very apt, I suppose, to ask me another. But it happens just now, Mr. Coverdale, that you can tell me more about the maker of those little purses than I can tell you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There was an eggsterrordinary {{noise from}} where my missis was standing; like the gurgling water makes {{sometimes}} {{running down the}} kitchen sink at 'ome, only worse. Then they all started talking together, and 'arf-a- dozen times or more Miss Lamb called me to back 'er up in wot she was saying, but I only <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>'ead,</b> <b>and</b> at last, arter tossing her 'ead at Cap'n Tarbell and telling 'im she wouldn't 'ave 'im if he'd got fifty million a year, the five of 'em 'eld my missis while she went off.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good, gallant heart!" [...] thought I to myself; but I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> smiling, <b>and</b> said, [...] "Never {{think of}} it: impose on {{yourself}} no such task. You write to me!--you'll not have time." ...|$|R
6000|$|I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> held up my rifle. [...] "You'll {{have to go}} aloft to do it, and {{the first}} man that gets into the shrouds will get this." ...|$|E
60|$|The carrier {{looked at}} me, {{as if to}} inquire if she were coming back. I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> said I thought not. 'Then come up,' said the carrier to the lazy horse; who came up accordingly.|$|E
6000|$|Now I {{looked at}} the scented noble who turned pale beneath his paint. Then I {{looked at the}} fat eunuch, Houman, who opened his mouth and gasped like a fish, and when I had looked, I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> said as though to myself, ...|$|E
5000|$|Todd was taunted {{by other}} {{students}} {{at her school}} for her low grades, a consequence of a language-based learning disability, and for the time she spent in hospital to treat her severe depression. [...] "It didn't really help that after {{she got out of}} the hospital recently some kids started calling her 'psycho' and saying she had been in the crazy hospital," [...] her mother said. [...] "She went to the hospital, she had therapy, she had counselling, she was on a good track. On the day she gets out, that happens. I <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> I think, 'Are kids really that nasty, do they really not think, what if it was them?'" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{asked the}} {{question}} so earnestly that I imagined he had softened at the last moment, and feared to leave the world with another homicide upon his conscience. Truth, however, compelled me to <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> mournfully, <b>and</b> to intimate that the wound would prove a mortal one.|$|R
2500|$|As Tommy {{walked back}} to his corner after shaking Louis' hand, I {{followed}} him and seized his glove. [...] "Tommy, a wonderful perform—" [...] I began... Then I dropped his hand like a red-hot coal! He had started to raise his arm. He thought I {{had given him the}} fight and the world championship! I literally ran away, <b>shaking</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> shouting. [...] "No! No! No!" [...] realising how I had raised his hopes for a few seconds only to dash them to the ground... That's the last time my emotions will get the better of me in a prize fight! There was much booing at the announced result, but, as I say it, it was all emotional. I gave Tommy two rounds and one even—and both his winning rounds were close.|$|R
60|$|I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> {{tried to}} think the thing out while all the time those {{wonderful}} eyes of hers seemed to draw the soul from me. It {{seemed to me that}} she bent forward and held up her face to me. Then I lost my reason and also bent forward. Yes, she made me mad, and, save her, I forgot all.|$|E
60|$|I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> {{said that}} at present I feared {{it would not be}} possible, but that I would see about it. His face fell, and I could see a warning of danger in it, for there was a sudden fierce, sidelong look which meant killing. The man is an undeveloped homicidal maniac. I shall test him with his present craving and see how it will work out, then I shall know more.|$|E
6000|$|... "Marion {{can tell}} you," [...] he said. He motioned towards the coffee-pot and asked, [...] "More?" [...] I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> he said, [...] "Come out {{and let us}} see what the {{maritime}} interests have been doing for us. Pipe or cigar?" [...] I chose cigarettes, and he brought the box off the table, stopping {{on his way to}} the veranda, and taking his pipe and tobacco-pouch from the hall mantel.|$|E
6000|$|I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> vigorously, <b>and</b> saying, [...] "No more! no more!" [...] threw {{myself over}} the wall, and seized the rope, Rectus holding the grapnel {{in its place}} as I did so. As I let myself down from knot to knot, a thought crossed my mind: [...] "How {{are we going to}} get that grapnel after we both are down?" ...|$|R
60|$|I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> sadly, <b>and</b> {{motioned to}} the {{starting}} lever. Perry pulled it toward him, and once again we were plunging downward toward eternity {{at the rate of}} seven miles an hour. I sat with my eyes glued to the thermometer and the distance meter. The mercury was rising very slowly now, though even at 145 degrees it was almost unbearable within the narrow confines of our metal prison.|$|R
6000|$|I {{could not}} forbear <b>shaking</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> smiling {{a little at}} his ignorance. And being no {{stranger}} to the art of war, I gave him a description of cannons, culverins, muskets, carabines, pistols, bullets, powder, swords, bayonets, battles, sieges, retreats, attacks, undermines, countermines, bombardments, sea fights, ships sunk with a thousand men, twenty thousand killed on each side, dying groans, limbs flying in the air, smoke, noise, confusion, trampling to death under horses’ feet, flight, pursuit, victory; fields strewed with carcases, left for food to dogs and wolves and birds of prey; plundering, stripping, ravishing, burning, and destroying. And to set forth the valour of my own dear countrymen, I assured him, “that I had seen them blow up a hundred enemies at once in a siege, and as many in a ship, and beheld the dead bodies drop down in pieces from the clouds, to the great diversion of the spectators.” ...|$|R
6000|$|I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> answered, 'I don't know. There {{are so many}} queer things {{hidden away}} {{in the heart of}} this great {{continent}} that I should be sorry to assert that there was no truth in it. Anyhow, we mean to try and find out. We intend to journey to Lekakisera, and thence, if we live to get so far, to this Lake Laga; and, if there are any white people beyond, we will do our best to find them.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Crowded Owl {{looked at}} me, but I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> said, [...] "No, no, no!" [...] Then he drew {{himself up and}} just stood there. He seemed struck dumb; but that didn't matter, as he couldn't talk to us, anyway. But he didn't go away. When we walked farther up the wharf, he {{followed}} us, and again offered us some beans. I began to get angry, and said [...] "No!" [...] pretty violently. At this, he left us, but as we turned {{at the end of}} the wharf, we saw him near the club-house, standing and talking with Maiden's Heart.|$|E
6000|$|He listened, but I do {{not know}} whether he heard much of my clack, and I got very tired of it myself at last. When I had {{finished}} my blackberries, he asked mechanically, in an echo of my former visit, with a repetition of his gesture towards the coffee-pot, [...] "More?" [...] I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> then he led the way out to the veranda, stopping to get his pipe and tobacco from the mantel on the way. But when we sat down in the early falling September twilight outside, he did not light his pipe, letting me smoke my cigarette alone.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{people here}} speak Dutch, and they cannot {{understand}} me, and I cannot understand them. And {{that is not}} the worst of it; they can't understand that I can't understand them. Sometimes the woman that comes to make my bed tells me something in Dutch, and I tell her that I can't understand. I know the Dutch for 'I can't understand.' Then she says, 'O!' and goes on to tell me over again, only now she tries to speak plainer--as if it could make any difference to me whether she speaks plain or not. I <b>shake</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> tell her I can't understand any thing. I tell her in French, and in English, and in Dutch. But it does not do any good, for she immediately begins again, and tells me the whole story all over again, trying to speak plainer than ever. I suppose she thinks that any body can understand Dutch, if she only speaks it plain enough to them.|$|R
60|$|In {{any case}} I adapted my conduct to this supposition, {{since it was}} clear that I must {{get them out of the}} room, and this would give me a ready excuse to do so. I first cast a glance at the door and {{observed}} that the key was within. I then made a gesture to the nuns to follow me. The Mother Superior asked me some question, but I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> impatiently <b>and</b> beckoned to her again.|$|R
6000|$|The {{poor old}} servant {{who was with}} me endeavoured to persuade me to remain here and {{to let him go}} alone--I <b>shook</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> silently <b>and</b> sadly; sick almost to death I leant upon his arm, and as there was no road for a chaise dragged my weary steps across the desolate downs to meet my fate, now too certain for the agony of doubt. Almost fainting I slowly {{approached}} the fatal waters; when we had quitted the town we heard their roaring[.] I whispered to myself in a muttering voice--"The sound is the same as that which I heard in my dream. It is the knell of my father which I hear."[42] ...|$|R
