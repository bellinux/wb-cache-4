40|$|This {{report is}} a {{combination}} of two Lehman Brothers projects – one project regarding country risk reporting and the other consolidating foreign exchange <b>spot</b> <b>credit</b> limits. The two projects are related in some ways and unrelated in others. The introduction and background are two common sections. All other sections of this report are project-specific. The project-specific sections are divided into “Part 1 ” and “Part 2. ” Part 1 relates to the country risk reporting project done in New York, whereas Part 2 relates to the project completed in London, regarding foreign exchange <b>spot</b> <b>credit</b> limit consolidation. i The main goal of this project was to improve risk reporting and technology at Lehman Brothers for both country and credit risk. The project was divided into two separate parts that were completed in parallel. One part was completed in New York which focused on the improvement of the country risk reporting process. The other was executed in London to consolidate foreign-exchange <b>spot</b> <b>credit</b> limits. ii Abstract Part 1 The main goal of this project was to improve on the current system for reporting country risk at Lehman Brothers in New York. The project was separated into two parts. The first was to evaluate the quality of the data going into the reports by running a series of analyses to test the accuracy of this information. The second part of the project was to automate the country risk reporting process, which will significantly reduce {{the time it takes to}} generate the country risk reports. To assist in the automation process we developed a prototype to model what features and capabilities the new system will have. iii Abstract Part 2 The project refined the process of comparing foreign-exchange <b>spot</b> <b>credit</b> limits across th...|$|E
40|$|Financial Infrastructure, {{as well as}} the {{research}} assistance of Amrita Nain In this paper I begin with a model that generates quantity credit rationing by banks in the <b>spot</b> <b>credit</b> market when the stock market is not doing well, i. e., asset prices are low. Then I provide a theoretical rationale for a bank loan commitment as partial insurance against such future rationing. Incorporating uncertainty about both the creditworthiness of borrowers and the abilities of banks to screen borrowers, I show that the reputational concerns of banks can lead to an equilibrium in which loan commitments serve their role in increasing the supply of credit relative to the <b>spot</b> <b>credit</b> market, but produce the inefficiency of excessive credit supply when the stock market is doing well. Despite this, welfare is higher with loan commitments than with <b>spot</b> <b>credit.</b> I use this result to then examine whether the level of the stock market – and more generally asset prices – should matter to bank regulators. My analysis suggests that it should, but not for the usual reason that a bull stock market could trigger inflation. Rather, it is because reputation-concerned banks lend too much during bull markets, leading to a worsening of credit quality and a higher liability for the federal deposit insurer. More stringent stock market information disclosure rules tend to attenuate this distortion and thus deserve consideration by bank regulators. A regulatory policy implication of the analysis is that regulation should be “state-contingent ” – regulatory auditing of bank asset portfolios should be more stringent during bull stock markets, or asset pricing bubbles.

40|$|We {{rationalize}} {{fixed rate}} loan commitments (forward credit contracting with options) {{in a competitive}} credit market with universal risk neutraility. Future interest rates are random, {{but there are no}} transactions costs. Borrowers finance projects with bank loans and choose ex post unobseravable actions that affect project payoffs. Credit contract design by the bank is the outcome of a (non-cooperative) Nash game between the bank and the borrower. The initial formal analysis is basically in two steps. First, we show that the only <b>spot</b> <b>credit</b> market Nash equilibria that exist are inefficient {{in the sense that they}} result in welfare losses for borrowers due to the bank's informational handicap. Second, we show that loan commitments, because of their ability to weaken the link between the offering bank's expected profit and the loan interest rate, enable to the complete elimination of informationally induced welfare losses and thus produce an outcome that strictly Pareto dominates any spot market equilibrium. Perhaps our most surprising result is that, if the borrower has some initial liquidity, it is better for the borrower to use it now to pay a commitment fee and buy a loan commitment that entitles it to borrow in the future rather than save it for use as an inside equity in conjunction with spot borrowing. ...|$|E

2500|$|Clear <b>Spots</b> {{production}} <b>credit</b> of Ted Templeman made Allmusic consider [...] "why in {{the world}} [...] wasn't more of a commercial success than it was", and that while fans [...] "of the fully all-out side of Beefheart might find the end result not fully up to snuff as a result, but those less concerned with pushing back all borders all the time will enjoy his unexpected blend of everything tempered with a new accessibility". The song [...] "Big Eyed Beans from Venus" [...] is noted as [...] "...a fantastically strange piece of aggression". A Clear Spot song, [...] "Her Eyes Are A Blue Million Miles", appeared on the soundtrack of the Coen brothers' cult comedy film The Big Lebowski (1998).|$|R
2500|$|The {{next two}} records, The Spotlight Kid (simply {{credited}} to [...] "Captain Beefheart") and Clear <b>Spot</b> (<b>credited</b> to [...] "Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band"), were both released in 1972. The atmosphere of The Spotlight Kid is, {{according to one}} critic, [...] "definitely relaxed and fun, maybe one step up from a jam". And though [...] "things do sound maybe {{just a little too}} blasé", [...] "Beefheart at his worst still has something more than most groups at their best." [...] The music is simpler and slower than on the group's two previous releases, the uncompromisingly original Trout Mask Replica and the frenetic Lick My Decals Off, Baby. This was in part an attempt by Van Vliet to become a more appealing commercial proposition as the band had made virtually no money during the previous two years—at the time of recording, the band members were subsisting on welfare food handouts and remittances from their parents. Van Vliet offered that he [...] "got tired of scaring people with what I was doing... I realized that I had to give them something to hang their hat on, so I started working more of a beat into the music". Magic Band members have also said that the slower performances were due in part to Van Vliet's inability to fit his lyrics with the instrumental backing of the faster material on the earlier albums, a problem that was exacerbated in that he almost never rehearsed with the group. In the period leading up to the recording the band lived communally, first at a compound near Ben Lomond, California and then in northern California near Trinidad. The situation saw a return to the physical violence and psychological manipulation that had taken place during the band's previous communal residence while composing and rehearsing Trout Mask Replica. According to John French, the worst of this was directed toward Harkleroad. In his autobiography Harkleroad recalls being thrown into a dumpster, an act he interpreted as having metaphorical intent.|$|R

40|$|Predictions of firm-level {{credit spreads}} {{based on the}} current <b>spot</b> and forward <b>credit</b> spreads can be {{significantly}} improved upon by using {{the information contained in}} the shape of the credit-spread curve. However, the current credit-spread curve is not a sufficient statistic for predicting future out-of-sample credit spreads; predictions can be significantly improved upon by exploiting the information contained {{in the shape of the}} riskless yield curve. In the presence of credit-spread and riskless factors, other macroeconomic, marketwide, and firm-specific risk variables do not significantly improve predictions of credit spreads. These results have important implications for credit-spreads modeling as well as for better understanding corporate capital structure and risk management policies. ...|$|R
50|$|Under {{new manager}} Nigel Spackman, Craig started Millwall's {{first two games}} of the 2006-07 season, but was sent off after only four minutes of the latter game against Leyton Orient. Craig {{returned}} to the team after his suspension and the replacement of Spackman with Willie Donachie, but a dislocated shoulder suffered in a 2-0 Football League Trophy second round win over Bournemouth on 14 October 2006 saw Craig out of action until January 2007. Upon his return, Craig immediately regained his starting <b>spot</b> and was <b>credited</b> with assists for both Neil Harris' goals in a 2-0 win over Carlisle United on 10 March. Craig made 32 appearances during the 2006-07 season and scored his only goal of the campaign in {{the final game of}} the season against Bradford City. Craig departed the club in June 2007, having made 87 appearances and scored two goals in his four years as a first team player.|$|R
40|$|I develop various {{frameworks}} for {{the separation of}} loss given default and default in-tensity present in securities with credit risk. They include <b>spot</b> and forward <b>credit</b> default swaps, digital default swaps and bonds. Cross-sectional no-arbitrage restriction between different securities extracts the pure measure of default intensity and loss given default not contaminated by the other. Using spot and forward CDS premium data of 10 emerg-ing market sovereigns, I find that 75 % level of loss given default prevails in the sovereign CDS markets across countries over time. Positive correlation between loss given default and default intensity is only found in Brazil and Venezuela {{during the period of}} political turmoil in each country. This result is puzzling considering diverse fundamentals across countries and time variation of the marginal rate of substitution. Loss given default be-low (above) the 75 % generates negative (positive) pricing errors in forward CDS and the magnitude of them is economically significant. This persistent negative (positive) pricing errors with mis-specified loss given default higher (lower) than the true one are consistent with the model developed...|$|R

Even without having {{appeared}} offline, the advert was discussed {{by a number of}} mainstream television programmes, including Good Morning America, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, and The View, and news networks such as CNN, NBC, and ABC News; the overwhelming majority came out in support of the campaign's message. Spaces at the mother and daughter workshops sold out almost immediately, and the total exposure generated through the $50,000 piece was estimated by Ogilvy & Mather in October 2006 as being worth around $150M. Comparisons have often been drawn up between the campaign and Dove's earlier purchase of a 30-second spot for Little Girls during the Super Bowl XL. The Super Bowl spot cost an estimated $2.5M, reached an audience of 500 million, and generated only one third of the boost in traffic to the Campaign for Real Beauty website of Evolution. The <b>spot</b> was also <b>credited</b> for its part in producing double-figure growth in sales of Dove product, and Unilever reported that its overall sales in the period following the release of Evolution rose by 5.8%, up from 3.9% the previous year.|$|R

[...] The Bishop of Clogher was there too; but he stood privately in a gallery. I went to dine with Lord Treasurer, but he was gone to Wimbledon, his daughter Caermarthen's(34) country seat, seven miles off. So I went back, and dined privately with Mr. Addison, whom I had left to go to Lord Treasurer. I keep fires yet; I am very extravagant. I sat this evening with Sir A. Fountaine, and we amused ourselves with making IFS for Dilly.
