5|$|When the Negev forces {{reached the}} coastal road, they {{realized}} {{that they could not}} continue on their vehicles, which could not travel in the <b>sand</b> <b>dunes</b> {{to the west of the}} road. The vehicles were therefore left with a platoon to the south of Isdud to block a possible Egyptian retreat. The other soldiers continued on foot into the <b>sand</b> <b>dunes</b> in an attempt to flank the Egyptian positions. On the second try, the Negev forces successfully captured several key points in the village, and destroyed a cannon. Nahum Sarig, the Negev Brigade commander, later wrote that the lack of intelligence on the enemy prevented the Israeli force from continuing its assault, while the Egyptians had time to regroup.|$|E
40|$|Avalanches {{of various}} sizes occur due to {{instability}} during <b>sand</b> <b>dune</b> dynamics. A physically viable equation to model <b>sand</b> <b>dune</b> dynamics is a first order nonlinear difference equation. To visualize the size distribution of avalanches, <b>sand</b> <b>dune</b> dynamics has been numerically simulated by changing the strength of nonlinearity parameter (lambda) that shows different impacts on dune dynamics. An equation to compute avalanche diameters, by considering the inter-slipface angles of a simulated <b>sand</b> <b>dune</b> under dynamics, is proposed. Using this equation, avalanche diameters have been computed from a dynamically changing simulated <b>sand</b> <b>dune...</b>|$|R

50|$|The DuWoong wetland is {{a coastal}} <b>sand</b> <b>dune</b> in South Korea. The DuWoong wetland {{is located in}} the south of the Sinduri coastal <b>sand</b> <b>dune</b> at Sinduri beach, Wonbukmeon, Taean, South Chungcheong Do. Its coastal length is 3.4 km and its width is 500 m, which is {{relatively}} wide. The Sinduri coastal <b>sand</b> <b>dune</b> was formed by sands carried to the coast many years ago.|$|R
5|$|Damage {{was light}} in Maryland. Some <b>sand</b> <b>dunes</b> and wooden {{structures}} were damaged, and above-normal tides occurred. In New Jersey, high winds caused power outages and knocked down trees and power lines. Minor coastal flooding of streets and houses was reported. Otherwise, {{damage in the}} state was minor.|$|E
5|$|Gibraltar's {{appearance}} in prehistory was very different. Whereas {{today it is}} surrounded by sea, the water level was much lower in prehistoric times, when the polar ice caps were larger. The current peninsula {{was surrounded by a}} fertile coastal plain, with marshes and <b>sand</b> <b>dunes</b> supporting an abundant variety of animals and plants.|$|E
5|$|Littlehampton and its harbour were guarded from naval {{attack by}} Littlehampton Redoubt {{on the western}} bank {{at the mouth of}} the river, {{completed}} in 1854, which is now screened from the open sea by Climping <b>sand</b> <b>dunes.</b> This fort replaced a seven-gun battery on the east bank, which was built in 1764.|$|E
50|$|A {{fight to}} close down the <b>sand</b> <b>dune</b> portion of the park or {{restrict}} its access {{came to a head}} in 2009 when neighbors came out in opposition to the <b>sand</b> <b>dune</b> over noise, traffic and overcrowding concerns. Several City Council meetings addressed the issues involved, and the <b>sand</b> <b>dune</b> was closed and fenced. After negotiation, it was reopened in August 2010 after the implementation of substantial use mitigation measures.|$|R

50|$|The <b>sand</b> <b>dune</b> {{habitats}} {{are currently}} being destroyed {{for the development of}} urban areas, forestry, and grassland advancement. Therefore, the survival of the species is threatened, as they depend greatly on the <b>sand</b> <b>dune</b> ecosystem.|$|R
5|$|The genus Iridomyrmex inhabits rural, arid, and {{semi-arid}} areas. Nests {{are found}} in Acacia, Agathis, Banksia, Casuarina and Eucalyptus woodland, in pastures, Callitris forests, city parks, farmlands, grasslands, heath, <b>sand</b> <b>dunes,</b> savanna woodland, swamps, urban gardens, wet rain-forests, wet and dry sclerophyll woodland, and even in buildings such as hotels and houses.|$|E
5|$|The {{large number}} of {{visitors}} at coastal sites sometimes has negative effects. Wildlife may be disturbed, a frequent difficulty for species that breed in exposed areas such as ringed plovers and little terns, and also for wintering geese. During the breeding season, the main breeding areas for terns and seals are fenced off and signposted. Plants can be trampled, which is a particular problem in sensitive habitats such as <b>sand</b> <b>dunes</b> and vegetated shingle. A boardwalk made from recycled plastic crosses the large <b>sand</b> <b>dunes</b> {{near the end of}} the Point, which helps to reduce erosion. It was installed in 2009 at a cost of £35,000 to replace its much less durable wooden predecessor. Dogs are not allowed from April to mid-August because of the risk to ground-nesting birds, and must be on a lead or closely controlled at other times.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} part of the commune is hilly but relatively favorable to agriculture, while the southern part is flat and characterized by <b>sand</b> <b>dunes.</b> Situated at the southern boundary of the Sahara-Sahel region of southern Mauritania, the climate is generally hot and dry.|$|E
50|$|Monte Kaolino is a <b>sand</b> <b>dune</b> in Hirschau, Bavaria, Germany. It {{consists}} of 35000000 t of sand, {{a by-product of}} kaolinite production over the years. The <b>sand</b> <b>dune</b> is now used as a ski resort {{in addition to other}} activities.|$|R
50|$|The reserve {{represents}} the last fully forming <b>sand</b> <b>dune</b> system in North Ayrshire following the destruction and stabilisation of the Ardeer Hills <b>sand</b> <b>dune</b> {{system in the}} 19th century. Its sands are shifting and therefore changing the structure and position of the dunes.|$|R

5|$|The {{soil and}} {{topography}} in the catchment are predominantly sandy with very low water retention capacity. The land use {{pattern in the}} Pushkar valley that drains into the lake comprises 30% of the area under shifting <b>sand</b> <b>dunes,</b> 30% under hills (degraded and barren) and streams and 40% of the area is agricultural.|$|E
5|$|The species {{grows in}} <b>sand</b> <b>dunes</b> of white, white-grey or {{yellow-brown}} sand, amongst {{a system of}} ephemeral salt creeks. Populations occur both in low-lying areas near creeks, and atop dunes. The vegetation {{has been described as}} low open woodland over heath, and as tall open shrubland with some scattered trees.|$|E
5|$|Deir al-Balah {{remained}} in Egyptian hands until around 1150 BC when the Philistines conquered the southern coastal area of Canaan. The Philistine settlement {{is thought to}} have been situated southwest of the excavation site; its remains are hidden under large <b>sand</b> <b>dunes.</b> Five pits dug into the Late Bronze Age layers and containing Philistine pottery are among the few findings from that period.|$|E

40|$|Two {{kinds of}} Star dunes are {{simulated}} numerically {{in order to}} make clear the mechanism of their formation. The flow above the <b>sand</b> <b>dune</b> has been investigated by using Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) method. The numerical method employed in this study can be divided in three parts: (i) Calculation of the air flow above the <b>sand</b> <b>dune</b> by using standard MAC method with ageneralized coordinate system; (ii) Estimation of the sand transfer caused by the flow through the friction; (iii) Determination of the shape of the sand surface. Since the computational domain is changed due to step (iii), these procedures are repeated until typical shape of the <b>sand</b> <b>dune</b> is formed. Two cases of dunes are simulated. the first case, when the winds blow from three directions, the <b>sand</b> <b>dune</b> kiends at three directions and becomes the shape of astar with three arms. the second case, when the winds blow from three pairs of opposing directions, the <b>sand</b> <b>dune</b> extends in four directions, becomes the shape of astar with four arms. 1...|$|R

5|$|In January 2006, the FBI and Aruban {{authorities}} interviewed—or in some cases, re-interviewed—several of Holloway's fellow classmates in Alabama. On January 17, Aruban police {{searched for}} Holloway's body in <b>sand</b> <b>dunes</b> {{on the northwest}} coast of Aruba, as well as areas close by the Marriott beach. Additional searches took place in March and April 2006, without result.|$|E
5|$|Kauri gum is a fossilised resin detracted from kauri trees (Agathis australis), {{which is}} made into crafts such as jewellery. Kauri forests once covered much of the North Island of New Zealand, before Māori and European {{settlers}} caused deforestation, causing several areas to revert to <b>sand</b> <b>dunes,</b> scrubs, and swamps. Even afterward, ancient kauri fields continued to provide a source for the gum and the remaining forests.|$|E
5|$|Other {{breeding}} birds include ringed plovers and Eurasian oystercatchers in the <b>sand</b> <b>dunes,</b> and water rails in the reed bed. Sedge, reed and Cetti's warblers all {{nest in the}} wetland, and little egrets are now common on the reserve. In early summer, scarcer migrants like the little gull, black tern, Eurasian spoonbills and garganey may pass through {{on their way to}} breed elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|The Anzac Mounted Division {{had been}} ordered to cut the road linking Jaffa to Jerusalem by {{capturing}} Ramleh and Ludd. This was the only main road from the coast through Ramleh up the Vale of Ajalon to Jerusalem. During the morning Meldrum's New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade crossed the river close to the <b>sand</b> <b>dunes</b> with 1st Light Horse Brigade on its right. By 09:00 El Kubeibeh had been occupied by the New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigade before pushing on towards the Wadi Hunayn. Here Ottoman rearguards were encountered in the orange groves and on the hills between El Kubeibeh and the <b>sand</b> <b>dunes.</b> About noon the 1st Light Horse Brigade drove an Ottoman rearguard from a ridge facing Yibna where the Anzac Mounted Division had bivouaced {{the night before and}} occupied the village of Rehovot also called Deiran. At the same time the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade fought off a strongly entrenched rearguard at Ayun Kara. After conceding considerable ground the Ottoman soldiers made a vigorous counterattack but were finally defeated.|$|E
5|$|The green hairstreak, purple hairstreak, hummingbird hawk-moth and {{ghost moth}} are {{sometimes}} seen, {{particularly in the}} woods at Holkham, along with the common butterfly and moth species. In some years the clouded yellow, Camberwell beauty, painted lady or diamondback moth may be seen, and the silver Y can sometimes occur in huge numbers. The dune tiger beetle is a nationally rare denizen of moist <b>sand</b> <b>dunes.</b>|$|E
5|$|The katipo is {{restricted}} to a highly specialised habitat and is only found near the seashore living among <b>sand</b> <b>dunes.</b> They generally reside on the landward side of dunes closest to the coast where they are most sheltered from storms and sand movement. They can sometimes be associated with dunes several kilometres from the sea when these dunes extend inland for long distances.|$|E
