40|$|Utilization of {{rice straw}} as a {{building}} material {{is the main}} aim of this work. The study is divided into four divisions; study the effect of treatments on the constituents and tensile properties of rice straw, hydration of rice straw with Portland cement, development of high content fly ash cementitious binder, and determination physical and mechanical properties of <b>straw</b> <b>fly</b> ash cementitious binder composites. Treating rice straw with 1...|$|E

Mechanical properties test such as prism compressive strength, elastic modulus and Poisson's ratios use standard prismatic blocks. Under different rate of corn straw, cement, sand and fly ash, test gets the full stress-strain curve. Results show that with increase of volume of corn straw, the prism compressive strength reduces significantly. Comparing with natural concrete, elastic modulus of straw concrete can reduces greatly. Poisson’s ratio reduces with increase of volume of corn <b>straw.</b> <b>Fly</b> ash could improve {{property of the}} material and replace cement, but excessive replacement will reduce the strength of material...|$|E
5000|$|On 27 August 2012 a World War II 250 Kilogram {{aircraft}} {{bomb was}} found just one meter under the surface. [...] The bomb had a chemical fuse that could {{still have been}} functional and therefore could explode at any time under the right conditions. The Süddeutsche Zeitung brought this up with Waldhauser (owner of the pub), and he replied, [...] "Obviously we did not party hard enough, or else the whole place would have been flattened. This quite nearly casts a poor light on the 7!" [...] The bomb could not be defused, so a controlled explosion was performed on 28 August, which also meant that over 2500 {{people living in the}} area had to be evacuated. Because of the detonation, flaming <b>straw</b> <b>flew</b> on some of the roofs of the houses, though firefighters were already prepared in case of such emergencies and extinguished the threat. Even though it was a controlled explosion, 17 nearby houses were damaged and two heavily, making the cost of everything in the millions of euros. Windows were smashed and window frames and the façades were damaged. A fashion boutique completely burnt down.|$|R
60|$|The {{hours he}} spent with his uncle and aunt were {{exhausted}} {{in listening to}} the oft-repeated tale of narrative old age. Yet even there his imagination, the predominant faculty of his mind, was frequently excited. Family tradition and genealogical history, upon which much of Sir Everard's discourse turned, is the very reverse of amber, which, itself a valuable substance, usually includes <b>flies,</b> <b>straws,</b> and other trifles; whereas these studies, being themselves very insignificant and trifling, do nevertheless serve to perpetuate {{a great deal of}} what is rare and valuable in ancient manners, and to record many curious and minute facts which could have been preserved and conveyed through no other medium. If, therefore, Edward Waverley yawned at times over the dry deduction of his line of ancestors, with their various intermarriages, and inwardly deprecated the remorseless and protracted accuracy with which the worthy Sir Everard rehearsed the various degrees of propinquity between the house of Waverley-Honour and the doughty barons, knights, and squires to whom they stood allied; if (notwithstanding his obligations to the three ermines passant) he sometimes cursed in his heart the jargon of heraldry, its griffins, its moldwarps, its wyverns, and its dragons, with all the bitterness of Hotspur himself, there were moments when these communications interested his fancy and rewarded his attention.|$|R
40|$|Rice straw {{gasification}} {{was carried}} out in a laboratory fluidized bed reactor system from 600 to 800 °C in order to well-understand the release and occurrence mode of alkali metals as a function of temperature during the gasification process. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) was applied to analyze the original rice <b>straw</b> and obtained <b>fly</b> ash at different temperatures. The results show that the Water-Soluble, Ammonium acetate-Soluble, Hydrochloric acid-Soluble, and Aluminosilicate Combination-Soluble modes of the Na and K contents in rice straw decreased in sequence. The content of Water-Soluble salts of Na and K accounts for more than 50 %, while the content of the Aluminosilicate Combination-Soluble mode is the lowest: less than 5 %. The release rate of Na appears to be consistent but nonlinear, increasing with gasification conversion ranges between 50. 2 % and 70. 8 %, from which we can deduce that temperature is not the only factor that impacts Na emission. The release of K can be divided into two stages at 700 °C. At the first stage, the release rate of K is almost invariable, ranging from 23. 3 % to 26 %. At the second stage, the release rate increases sharply: up to 55. 9 %. The concentration and the proportion of the Water-Soluble, Ammonium acetate-Soluble, and Hydrochloric acid-Soluble modes of Na in fly ash decrease with a temperature increase. The release of K can be explained as follows: one path is an organic form of K converted into its gaseous phase; the other path is a soluble inorganic form of K that is volatile at a high temperature. With a temperature increase, the Aluminosilicate Combination-Soluble mode of both Na and K increases...|$|R
