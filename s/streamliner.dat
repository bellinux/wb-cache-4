It {{operated}} {{this and other}} routes until its retirement in 1960, when it was donated to Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry, where it remains on public display. The train is generally regarded as the first successful <b>streamliner</b> on American railroads.|$|E
5|$|Two unusual {{events have}} been recorded. Firstly, in 1940 No.6221 Queen Elizabeth had its Caledonian blue colour scheme {{replaced}} by the crimson lake, the only such instance. Secondly, it was often speculated that {{at some time in}} the two-year history of the Coronation Scot a crimson <b>streamliner</b> might have hauled the blue trainset. Such an event has, probably uniquely, been captured on film.|$|E
5|$|Although {{depicted}} {{with the}} tower in a Rand McNally map from 1893, later lithographs {{of the first}} 141 Jackson Street location display a red-roofed building without a tower. Memorabilia of the current building is abundant, with postcards of panoramic scenes from LaSalle Street, the clock, and lighted upper decks having been produced for decades. In views from the Museum Campus, the building's crown is framed by the middle floors of the taller Sears Tower in the background. Photographer Andreas Gursky has used the location for still life prints such as 1997's Chicago Board of Trade, I and 1999's Chicago Board of Trade, II. A photograph of the exterior, from the Museum series by Thomas Struth, is {{in the collection of}} the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. An often-reproduced painting by Leslie Ragan for the New York Central Railroad depicts <b>streamliner</b> locomotives idling at LaSalle Street Station with the Board of Trade Building looming prominently in the background.|$|E

5000|$|Pedal powered faired {{vehicles}} with two wheels, intended primarily for racing, are usually called <b>streamliners.</b> <b>Streamliners</b> have set many speed and distance records.

However, the additional wheels tend to increase aerodynamic drag, which reduces energy efficiency and limits their use for racing.|$|R

25|$|The Union Pacific Railroad's M-10001 was {{a record}} {{breaking}} diesel-electric <b>streamliner</b> train built in late 1934 by Pullman-Standard with a power system developed by General Motors Electro-Motive Corporation using a Winton 201A Diesel engine and General Electric generator, control equipment and traction motors.

All cars were articulated—trucks were shared between each car. It was delivered on October 2, 1934, and was used for display, test and record-setting runs {{for the next two}} months before being returned to Pullman-Standard for an increase in its power and capacity, following which it was placed into service as the City of Portland train.|$|E

25|$|The Spirit {{could no}} longer be {{considered}} a high-speed train service, with a timetabled 13-hour-45-minute journey from Melbourne to Sydney.
