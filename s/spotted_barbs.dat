5000|$|Barbonymus is a ray-finned fish genus in {{the family}} Cyprinidae, {{containing}} some barb species. The genus was only established in 1999, with the tinfoil barb (B. schwanenfeldii) as type species; thus, these fish are sometimes collectively called tinfoils. The new genus was established {{in recognition of the}} fact that some large Asian [...] "barbs", formerly rather indiscriminately lumped in Barbus (typical barbels and relatives), Barbodes (barb-like carps) and Puntius (<b>spotted</b> <b>barbs),</b> form a distinct evolutionary lineage.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, {{many species}} of Puntius have been {{classified}} in several genera, including Barbus. Despite the reclassifications, the specific epithet remains the same in these [...] - [...] except in cases of homonymies [...] - [...] as Barbus and Puntius have the same grammatical gender. The closest living relatives of the <b>spotted</b> <b>barbs</b> are the genus Cyprinion and perhaps the genus Capoeta. These and the other [...] "typical" [...] barbs and barbels were formerly often separated as subfamily Barbinae, but this group is highly paraphyletic {{with regard to the}} Cyprininae and better merged there at least for the largest part (including Puntius). In particular the genus Barbonymus, containing the tinfoil barb and its relatives [...] - [...] for some time included in Puntius [...] - [...] appears {{to be a kind of}} carp that has evolved convergently with barbs.|$|E

50|$|Pethia cumingii, {{known as}} the Cuming's barb or the two <b>spot</b> <b>barb</b> (though that name can also apply to the Ticto barb, P. ticto), is a species of cyprinid fish endemic to Sri Lanka.|$|R
50|$|Barbodes binotatus, {{commonly}} known as the <b>spotted</b> <b>barb</b> or common barb, is a tropical species of cyprinid fish native to Southeast Asia. It has also become established as an exotic species in Palau and Singapore.|$|R
40|$|The {{life history}} traits and gonad {{development}} of an endemic cyprinid fish, the <b>spotted</b> <b>barb,</b> Capoeta mandica (Bianco & Banarescu 1982), from southern Iran was investigated by regular monthly collections from February 2006 through January 2007 and {{on the basis of}} microscopic and macroscopic analyses. No information on the spawning characteristics of the fish are available to date. A total of 335 specimens were captured using electrofishing including 253 males and 102 females, resulting in 2. 5 : 1 (male: female) sex ratio, which is significantly different from the expected ratio. The commonly known five standard maturation stages were determined based on the size, shape and weight of the gonads, degree of occupation of the body cavity, presence or absence of ripe oocytes, or milt, diameter of the oocytes in the ovary, and histological observations. These stages were correlated to the reproductive indices. The ovum diameters ranged from 0. 04 to 1. 31 mm, with the highest mean value in May. The condition factor of male and female specimens was the highest in April. The female GSI increased from March to May, peaking in the middle of spring and decreased significantly in June. Based on the gonad maturation stages, gonadosomatic index (GSI), modified GSI, mean egg diameter, condition factor (K) and Dobriyal index (DI), it was concluded that the <b>spotted</b> <b>barb</b> spawns during May and June. The provided data, contribute baseline data towards management ecology and conservation of this endemic fish species...|$|R
50|$|Diverse {{types of}} plants, fish and mussels are {{supported}} by rivers and streams that flow through this region, sourced in the central highlands. Sri Lanka harbors 90 species of freshwater fish and 21 species of crabs. Twenty six species of fish are confined to this ecoregion. As unraveling of new species is continuing, the number of endemics {{is expected to rise}} greatly. Most of these fishes are small and specialized to their rivers and streams. Some of the fish species inhabiting this ecoregion include Two <b>Spot</b> <b>Barb,</b> Black ruby barb, Cherry barb and Black-lined Barb. More rare species in this ecoregion include Spotted Loach, Ornate paradisefish, Rasbora wilpita, Puntius martenstyni and Pearly rasbora. Many of the fishes of this ecoregion have commercial value and are harvested in fisheries and traded for aquariums. Apart from fishes, this ecoregion is also rich with crocodiles, turtles and amphibians.|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} eye size, {{types of}} visual cell and mosaic, {{and the existence}} of retinal tapetum {{in the eyes of the}} <b>spotted</b> <b>barb</b> Puntius binotatus were determined to gain baseline information on its visual capability. The P. binotatus acquired relatively larger eye size than the other similar sized freshwater fish species with its retina being contained both cone and rod visual cells (cone ellipsoid to outer nuclei ratio = 1 : 5. 7). Three types of cone were identified (double-, central single- and corner single- cones), arranging in the square mosaic, and the retinal tapetum was determined to be existed. These results evidenced that the P. binotatus has good visual capability as it possessed both the photopic and scotopic visions. Vision can be the primary sense for the P. binotatus. Further study is needed to gain more information on the vision of this species...|$|R
40|$|Fluctuating Asymmetry (FA) {{commonly}} uses {{to evaluate}} environmental stress and developmental variability of different biotic elements. This study aims {{to describe the}} possible effects of pollutants on the body shapes of <b>spotted</b> <b>barb</b> (Puntius binotatus) with notes of physico-chemical parameters of Wawa River, Bayugan City, Agusan del Sur and Tubay River, Tubay, Agusan del Norte, Philippines. There were a total of 80 samples (40 females and 40 males) collected from each sampling areas. Digital imaging was prepared and the acquired images were loaded into tpsDig 2 program. Standard landmarks on fish morphometric were employed. Using thin-plate spline (TPS) series, landmark analysis were completed and subjected to symmetry and asymmetry in geometric data (SAGE) software. Results in Procrustes ANOVA showed high significant differences of (P< 0. 0001) in the three factors analyzed: the individuals; sides; and the interaction of individuals and sides; indicating high fluctuating asymmetry. In Tubay River, the level of asymmetry in females were 79. 06...|$|R
25|$|Within {{eight months}} of the show's launch, it reached the number-one <b>spot</b> in <b>BARB's</b> TV ratings and has {{consistently}} remained among the top-rated TV programmes in Britain. In 2013, the average audience share for an episode was around 30 per cent. Today, EastEnders remains a significant programme {{in terms of the}} BBC's success and audience share, and also in the history of British television drama, tackling many dilemmas that are considered to be controversial and taboo issues in British culture and social life previously unseen on United Kingdom mainstream television.|$|R
50|$|Though {{given the}} {{runaround}} by the Carvers, he and Barb found that Marlo {{gave birth to}} a boy, in June 2000, and the Carvers had adopted him. Jennifer Deveraux had a car accident resulting in baby J.T. Brady falling into the river, while strapped in Isaac Carver's baby seat (his name was on it). <b>Barb</b> <b>spotted</b> the baby floating, like Moses in the rushes, and they rescued him. Thinking that he is Isaac, the Reibers fled to his aunt's cabin in the hills. Auntie discovered the surgery scar, and when the baby began to have breathing difficulties, Glen and Barb rushed him to the local hospital, but then returned to Salem. They already had a DNA test to prove Glen was the father of Marlo's child.|$|R
