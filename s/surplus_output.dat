This leads to the European Union purchasing millions of tonnes of <b>surplus</b> <b>output</b> every year at the stated guaranteed market price, and storing this produce in large quantities (leading to what critics have called 'butter mountains' and 'milk lakes'), before selling the produce wholesale to developing nations. In 2007 in response to a parliamentary written question the UK government revealed that over the preceding year the EU Public Stock had amassed [...] "13,476,812 tonnes of cereal, rice, sugar and milk products and 3,529,002 hectolitres of alcohol/wine", although the EU has claimed this level of oversupply is unlikely to be repeated. This point was actually proven in January 2009, where the EU had a store of 717,810 tonnes of cereals, 41,422 tonnes of sugar and a 2.3million hectolitre 'wine lake', showing that the stocks had diminished dramatically.|$|E

40|$|The most {{remarkable}} {{feature of the}} contemporary Indian economy {{is that it has}} witnessed an increase in the rate of growth of GDP, even while the share of the economic <b>surplus</b> in <b>output</b> has been increasing. This is perfectly possible in a boom owing to growing excess demand pressures, unleashing a process of profit inflation. But while a tendency towards profit inflation is discernible over the last few months, virtually the whole of the post-liberalization era has been free of any such tendency; indeed the Indian economy during this entire period can be categorized as a demand-constrained system. Now, in a demand-constrained system, a rising share of <b>surplus</b> in <b>output</b> should give rise to a stagnationist tendency, and not to an increase in the growth rate. How then do we explain the contemporary Indian economy? The reason why a rising share of <b>surplus</b> in <b>output</b> should cause a tendency towards stagnation in a demand-constrained economy, can be stated, following Michael Kalecki (1954), as follows. Investment in any period depends upon decisions taken earlier, and hence can be taken as fixed. This, with a balanced current account (for simplicity), must equal savings.

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to present a modeJ which broadly fits some of the salient features of Inter-industry wage differentials. Several recent empirical papers have found wage differences accross industries to be large and persistent. They also show high concordance accross occupations and countries. High wages appear to be paid in industries that have high capital/labor ratios and are highly profitable. Our model explains these facts on the basis of firm-specific human capital accumulation by individual workers. We focus on the bargaining between experienced workers and the firm over the division of the <b>surplus</b> <b>output</b> an experienced worker produces over that produced by inexperienced workers. We show that this surplus, and therefore equilibrium wages of trained workers, depends on the the capital/labor ratio when the technology has putty-clay features. We also show that when there is multilateral bargaining between all firms and experienced workers, wages also depend on the profitability of the firm. oo">t 61987...|$|E

Carbon tax levy, product subsidy, carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) and other factors are included in the emission reduction mechanism. The effects of emissions reduction and the economic impact of China’s overall steel industry (and that of its six main regions) are investigated for the first time under different scenarios. As new findings, we report the following: (1) Not all factors declined. The overall social welfare, consumer <b>surplus,</b> <b>output</b> and emissions decrease with a gradual increase in the reduction target, whereas the carbon tax value, unit value of product subsidies and total subsidies show a rising trend; (2) A combination of multiple emissions reduction policies is more effective than a single policy.

There is a need to significantly increase the productivity of subsistence/smallholder agriculture and ensure long-term food security. This can be achieved by encouraging farmers to pursue sustainable intensification of production through the use of improved inputs. This will require a dramatic increase in the use of fertiliser, organic inputs and conservation investments, combined with the development of well-functioning input and output markets to help farmers acquire and use improved inputs, market their (<b>surplus)</b> <b>output</b> and reduce transaction costs and risks. Increased productivity will reduce pressure on marginal lands, as the intensification of cultivated land will reduce pressure to crop fragile marginal lands.

40|$|Super-efficiency data envelopment {{analysis}} (DEA) {{model can}} be used in ranking the performance of efficient decision making units (DMUs). Because of the infeasibility problem associated with the super-efficiency DEA model, ranking has been restricted to the model where constant returns to scale and proportional changes in all inputs or all outputs are assumed. In fact, when super-efficiency is used as an efficiency stability measure, infeasibility means the highest super-efficiency. However, if super-efficiency is interpreted as input saving or <b>output</b> <b>surplus</b> achieved by a specific efficient DMU, infeasibility does not necessarily mean the highest super-efficiency. In order to obtain a complete ranking of efficient DMUs when the two assumptions are relaxed, a modified super-efficiency DEA model is proposed to overcome the infeasibility problem and to correctly capture the super-efficiency represented by the input saving or the <b>output</b> <b>surplus.</b> The current paper suggests using both input- and output-oriented super-efficiency models to characterize the super-efficiency when infeasibility occurs.

On the other hand, because staple foods account for a large portion of total household expenditures for both urban and rural households, policymakers also are drawn to policies that lower the retail price of staple foods for consumers. Achieving both objectives – increasing marketed supplies of food staples while maintaining low retail prices – are also key to continued poverty reduction, as smallholder incomes increase when they receive higher prices for their <b>surplus</b> marketed <b>output,</b> while lower retail food prices decrease the cost of living for both rural and urban households.

Local weather condition and the initial building energy performance are analysed to provide the guide for building refurbishment and the available renewable energy sources. Various passive design strategies are adopted for building refurbishment, such as building envelope improvements, shading device and efficient appliances. Solar and wind energies are captured to provide heating and electricity for the building, these include solar collector, PV panel and wind turbine. EnergyPlus simulation software is employed to investigate energy performance of the building with different passive design strategies and renewable energy systems. The research results show that applying passive design components into the building reduces the annual heating energy consumption of 37. 37 GJ, while increases the annual cooling energy requirement of 0. 99 GJ. The renewable energy systems consist of 4. 26 m 2 solar collectors and a 2. 5 kW wind turbine; they can produce enough heat and electricity to meet the building energy demands.

However, the evidence suggest that it will prove difficult to accommodate such price reductions within existing profit margins or through productivity gains. Moving up the value-added chain, shifting the composition of exports, diversifying the export base, and increasing domestic value added of exports could give room to further export expansion. However, experiences from Asian economies that had similar export-oriented growth suggest there are limits to the global market share a country can occupy. Rebalancing growth toward private consumption would provide a large impetus to output growth and reduce the need for gaining further market share.
