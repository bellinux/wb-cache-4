500|$|Filchner's {{view that}} the {{supposed}} sighting of New South Greenland {{could be explained by}} a mirage is echoed by Simpson-Housley. He suggests that Morrell and his crew saw a <b>superior</b> <b>mirage.</b> One form of <b>superior</b> <b>mirage,</b> sometimes described as a Fata Morgana, distorts distant flat coastlines or ice edges both vertically and horizontally, so they can appear to have tall cliffs and other features such as high mountain peaks and valleys. In his expedition account South, Shackleton gives a description of a Fata Morgana observed on [...] 1915, coincidentally as his ship Endurance drifted close to the recorded position of New South Greenland: [...] "The distant pack is thrown up into towering barrier-like cliffs, which are reflected in blue lakes and lanes of water at their base. Great white and golden cities of Oriental appearance at close intervals along these cliff-tops indicate distant bergs... The lines rise and fall, tremble, dissipate, and reappear in an endless transformation scene".|$|E
500|$|Morrell's account {{describes}} how {{on the day}} after turning north from his southernmost point, a large tract of land was sighted in the region of 67°52'N, 44°11'W. Morrell refers to this land as [...] "New South Greenland", and records that during the next few days Wasp explored more than [...] of coast. Morrell provided vivid descriptions of the land's features, with observations of its abundant wildlife. No such land exists; other appearances of land at or near this bearing, reported during the 1842 expedition of Sir James Clark Ross, have likewise proved imaginary. In 1917 the Scottish explorer William Speirs Bruce wrote that the existence of land in this area [...] "should not be rejected until absolutely disproved." [...] By this time both Wilhelm Filchner and Ernest Shackleton, in their respective ice-bound ships, had drifted close to the plotted positions of New South Greenland and reported no sign of it. It has been suggested that what Morrell saw was actually the eastern coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, some [...] further west from his sighting. This would require a navigational error of at least 10°, and a complete revision of Morrell's timeline after leaving the South Sandwich Islands. Assuming that Morrell did not invent the experience, a possible explanation is that he witnessed a <b>superior</b> <b>mirage.</b>|$|E
50|$|Probably {{the most}} {{credible}} explanation is a <b>superior</b> <b>mirage</b> or Fata Morgana seen at sea.|$|E

50|$|<b>Superior</b> <b>mirages</b> {{are quite}} common in polar regions, {{especially}} over large sheets of ice {{that have a}} uniform low temperature. <b>Superior</b> <b>mirages</b> also occur at more moderate latitudes, although in those cases they are weaker and {{tend to be less}} smooth and stable. For example, a distant shoreline may appear to tower and look higher (and, thus, perhaps closer) than it really is. Because of the turbulence, there appear to be dancing spikes and towers. This type of mirage is also called the Fata Morgana or hafgerdingar in the Icelandic language.|$|R

The uppermost inset frame shows an inferior mirage of the Farallon Islands. The second inset frame is the Farallon Islands with a green flash on the left-hand side. The two lower frames and the main frame all show <b>superior</b> <b>mirages</b> of the Farallon Islands. In these three frames, the <b>superior</b> <b>mirages</b> evolve from a 3-image mirage (an inverted image between two erect ones) to a 5-image mirage, and then back to a 2-image mirage. Such a display is consistent with a Fata Morgana. All frames but the upper one were photographed from about 50-70 feet above sea level. The upper frame was photographed from sea level.|$|R
50|$|A Fata Morgana can be {{observed}} from any altitude within the Earth's atmosphere, from sea level up to mountaintops, and even including the view from airplanes.A Fata Morgana {{can be described as}} a very complex <b>superior</b> <b>mirage</b> with more than three distorted erect and inverted images. Because of the constantly changing conditions of the atmosphere, a Fata Morgana can change in various ways within just a few seconds of time, including changing to become a straightforward <b>superior</b> <b>mirage.</b>|$|E
50|$|Phenomena of {{atmospheric}} optics related to atmospheric ducting include the green flash, Fata Morgana, <b>superior</b> <b>mirage,</b> mock mirage of astronomical objects and the Novaya Zemlya effect.|$|E

50|$|In {{the same}} way, ships {{that are in}} reality so far away {{that they should not}} be visible above the {{geometric}} horizon may appear on the horizon or even above the horizon as <b>superior</b> <b>mirages.</b> This may explain some stories about flying ships or coastal cities in the sky, as described by some polar explorers. These are examples of so-called Arctic mirages, or hillingar in Icelandic.|$|R
5000|$|Stoutenburg died {{of cancer}} in 1982 in Santa Barbara, California. At Stoutenburg's request, David R. Slavitt {{subsequently}} edited and published a selection of her poetry. The volume, Land of <b>Superior</b> <b>Mirages,</b> includes a number of poems that had been unpublished at her death. In his review, Robert von Hallberg wrote, [...] "Adrien Stoutenburg's poems deserve much more attention than they have received." [...] Some of Stoutenburg's papers, and also those of Laura Nelson Baker, are archived at the University of Minnesota Children's Literature Research Collection. [...] Papers relating to Stoutenburg's career as a poet are housed at The Bancroft Library at the University of California, Berkeley.|$|R
50|$|<b>Superior</b> <b>mirages</b> {{can have}} a {{striking}} effect due to the Earth's curvature. Were the Earth flat, light rays that bend down would soon hit the ground and only nearby objects would be affected. Since Earth is round, if their downward bending curve {{is about the same}} as the curvature of the Earth, light rays can travel large distances, perhaps from beyond the horizon. This was observed and documented {{for the first time in}} 1596, when a ship under the command of Willem Barentsz in search of the Northeast passage became stuck in the ice at Novaya Zemlya. The crew was forced to endure the polar winter there. They saw their midwinter night come to an end with the rise of a distorted Sun about two weeks earlier than expected. It was not until the 20th century that science could explain the reason: the real Sun had still been below the horizon, but its light rays followed the curvature of the Earth. This effect is often called a Novaya Zemlya mirage. For every 111.12 km the light rays can travel parallel to the Earth's surface, the Sun will appear 1° higher on the horizon. The inversion layer must have just the right temperature gradient over the whole distance to make this possible.|$|R
5000|$|A Fata Morgana (...) is {{an unusual}} and complex form of <b>superior</b> <b>mirage</b> that is seen in a narrow band right above the horizon. It is the Italian name for the Arthurian sorceress Morgan le Fay, from a belief that these mirages, often seen in the Strait of Messina, were fairy castles in the air or false land created by her {{witchcraft}} to lure sailors to their deaths. Although the term Fata Morgana is sometimes applied to other, more common kinds of mirages, the true Fata Morgana is different from both an ordinary <b>superior</b> <b>mirage</b> and an inferior mirage.|$|E
50|$|A <b>superior</b> <b>mirage</b> can be right-side up or upside down, {{depending}} on {{the distance of the}} true object and the temperature gradient. Often the image appears as a distorted mixture of up and down parts.|$|E

50|$|The P.1154 {{had been}} {{judged to be}} {{technically}} <b>superior,</b> but the <b>Mirage</b> had greater potential for cooperative development and production being spread across the member nations. The French government withdrew over {{the selection of the}} P.1154 over the Dassault design. In the UK the P.1154 had still found support for meeting the RAF needs and construction was under way on the prototype airframes when the newly elected government cancelled it in 1964 (along with other aircraft projects) on cost grounds.|$|R
50|$|In January 1962, HSA {{submitted}} the P.1154 design to NATO via the Ministry of Aviation. NBMR.3 attracted {{a total of}} eleven contenders, including Dassault's Mirage IIIV proposal, which would become viewed as the principal competitor to the P.1154. Substantial support for the Mirage IIIV came from Britain, work on the programme having involved the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC), while the Dassault-led design also held the favour of {{several members of the}} British Air Staff. While the P.1154 was judged to be technically <b>superior,</b> the <b>Mirage</b> IIIV had acquired a greater level of political palatability due to the co-operative development and production aspects proposed for the programme, under which work was to be distributed across a number of member nations. Protracting political maneuvering by firms and national governments alike was deployed in attempts to secure their respective project's selection.|$|R
5000|$|This {{would have}} been aided, on each occasion, by a {{temperature}} inversion in the atmosphere with temperature increasing with altitude above the canal, similar to {{the phenomenon of the}} <b>superior</b> image <b>mirage.</b> Temperature inversions like this are common. An increase in air temperature or lapse rate of 0.11 degrees Celsius per metre of altitude would create an illusion of a flat canal, and all optical measurements made near ground level would be consistent with a completely flat surface. If the lapse rate were higher than this (temperature increasing with height at a greater rate), all optical observations would be consistent with a concave surface, a [...] "bowl-shaped earth". Under average conditions, optical measurements are consistent with a spherical Earth approximately 15% less curved than its true diameter. Repetition of the atmospheric conditions required for each of the many observations is not unlikely, and warm days over still water can produce favourable conditions.|$|R
5000|$|Mirages can be {{categorized}} as [...] "inferior" [...] (meaning lower), [...] "superior" [...] (meaning higher) and [...] "Fata Morgana", one kind of <b>superior</b> <b>mirage</b> consisting {{of a series of}} unusually elaborate, vertically stacked images, which form one rapidly changing mirage.|$|E
5000|$|A Fata Morgana is {{an unusual}} and very complex form of mirage, a form of <b>{{superior}}</b> <b>mirage,</b> which, like many other kinds of superior mirages, is seen in a narrow band right above the horizon. It is an Italian phrase derived from the vulgar Latin for [...] "fairy" [...] and the Arthurian sorcerer Morgan le Fay, from {{a belief that the}} mirage, often seen in the Strait of Messina, were fairy castles in the air, or false land designed to lure sailors to their death created by her witchcraft. Although the term Fata Morgana is sometimes incorrectly applied to other, more common kinds of mirages, the true Fata Morgana {{is not the same as}} an ordinary <b>superior</b> <b>mirage,</b> and is certainly not the same as an inferior mirage.|$|E
50|$|A Fata Morgana, {{the name}} of which comes from the Italian {{translation}} of Morgan le Fay, the fairy shapeshifting half-sister of King Arthur, {{is a very complex}} <b>superior</b> <b>mirage.</b> It appears with alternations of compressed and stretched zones, erect images, and inverted images. A Fata Morgana is also a fast-changing mirage.|$|E
5|$|The P.1154 {{was judged}} to be {{technically}} <b>superior,</b> however, the <b>Mirage</b> acquired a greater level of political palatability due to the co-operative development and production aspects proposed for the programme, which spread work across a number of member nations. Protracting political maneuvering by firms and national governments alike was deployed in attempts to secure their respective project's selection. The P.1154 was ultimately selected to meet NBMR-3, however this {{did not lead to}} orders being placed. The French government subsequently withdrew from participation once the Dassault design had not emerged victorious. NATO lacked any central budget, relying on individual member nations to actually procure military equipment, and the NBMR-3 selection went unheeded by all of these nations. Thus, in 1965, the whole project was terminated.|$|R
50|$|Other phantom {{islands are}} {{probably}} due to navigational errors, occasional breakers, misidentification of icebergs, fog banks, pumice rafts from underwater volcanoes or optical illusions. Observed in the Weddell Sea in 1823 but never again seen, New South Greenland {{may have been the}} result of a <b>superior</b> <b>mirage.</b> Even deliberate fabrication has been suggested.|$|E
50|$|SAAF Mirage IIIRZs often flew at {{extremely}} low altitudes—sometimes down to fifty feet (15 metres)—then rapidly gained elevation {{to take their}} photographs. During the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale they also carried out mock sorties over enemy positions in Xangongo and Humbe {{in an attempt to}} lure out Cuban MiG-21s and MiG-23s, which could then be engaged by the <b>superior</b> <b>Mirage</b> F1AZs.|$|E
50|$|A Fata Morgana <b>superior</b> <b>mirage</b> {{of a ship}} {{can take}} many {{different}} forms. Even when the boat in the mirage {{does not seem to}} be suspended in the air, it still looks ghostly, and unusual, and what is even more important, it is ever-changing in its appearance. Sometimes a Fata Morgana causes a ship to appear to float inside the waves, at other times an inverted ship appears to sail above its real companion.|$|E

5000|$|Cape Wild is a {{prominent}} rock cape {{on the eastern}} end of the Organ Pipe Cliffs. This may be the cape viewed from the ship <b>Superior</b> <b>Mirage,</b> by the United States Exploring Expedition under Lieutenant Charles Wilkes, January 19, 1840. Wilkes applied the name [...] "Point Emmons" [...] for Lieutenant George F. Emmons of the Vincennes. The cape was accurately positioned by the Australasian Antarctic Expedition (1911-14) under Douglas Mawson, who named it for Frank Wild, a member of the expedition and leader of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition Western Base Party.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} {{fourteen}} frames, {{elements of the}} Fata Morgana mirage display alternations of compressed and stretched zones. The last two frames were photographed a few hours later, around sunset time. At that point in time, the air was cooler while the ocean was probably a little bit warmer, which caused the thermal inversion to be not as extreme as it was few hours before. A mirage was still present at that point, {{but it was not}} as complex as few hours before sunset: the mirage was no longer a Fata Morgana, but instead had become a simple <b>superior</b> <b>mirage.</b>|$|E
50|$|A <b>superior</b> <b>mirage</b> {{occurs when}} the air below the line of sight is colder than the air above it. This unusual {{arrangement}} is called a temperature inversion, since warm air above cold air {{is the opposite of}} the normal temperature gradient of the atmosphere. Passing through the temperature inversion, the light rays are bent down, and so the image appears above the true object, hence the name superior. Superior mirages are in general less common than inferior mirages, but, when they do occur, they tend to be more stable, as cold air has no tendency to move up and warm air has no tendency to move down.|$|E
50|$|Titanic Historian Tim Maltin {{theorized that}} the Californians {{inaction}} {{was the result}} of a cold water mirage, or <b>Superior</b> <b>mirage,</b> arising from differences in air temperature over the warmer waters of the Atlantic Ocean and the colder waters of the Labrador Current. Maltins suggested that this would cause a superior refraction, superimposing and stretching and distorting the edge of the sea and lifting images of objects, distorting their appearance. This would explain why the Titanics morse lamp was believed to be a flickering oil lamp on the mast of a much smaller ship, and why Capt. Lord thought the Titanic was a different vessel. If correct, Maltins theory would clear Capt. Lord of his inaction, and may further explain why the Titanics lookouts did not spot the iceberg earlier.|$|E
50|$|A Fata Morgana {{can go from}} {{superior}} to inferior mirage and back within a few seconds, depending on the constantly changing conditions of the atmosphere. Sixteen frames of the mirage of the Farallon Islands, which cannot be seen from sea level at all under normal conditions because they are located below the horizon, were photographed on the same day. The first fourteen frames have elements of a Fata Morgana display—alternations of compressed and stretched zones. The last two frames were photographed {{a few hours later}} around sunset. The air was cooler while the ocean was probably a little bit warmer, which made temperature inversion lower. The mirage was still present, but it was not as complex as it had been a few hours before sunset, and it corresponded no longer to a Fata Morgana but rather to a <b>superior</b> <b>mirage</b> display.|$|E
5000|$|The writer Rupert Gould, in {{a lengthy}} essay on New South Greenland {{published}} in 1929, queries {{the assumption that the}} sighting was simply invented by Morrell, partly on the grounds that very little weight is given to the discovery in Morrell's 500-page account. Gould writes: [...] "If Morrell wished to gain an undeserved reputation as an Antarctic explorer, one would think he could have gone a better way about it than to bury his pièces justificatives, after he had forged them, in an undistinguished corner of so bulky a book." [...] Nor would he have credited it to Captain Johnson two years earlier, rather than to himself.Gould also discusses the possibility that what Morrell sighted was the eastern coast of Graham Land, the so-called [...] "Foyn Coast", despite its being 14° further west from position of the New South Greenland sighting. Gould asserts that the features of the peninsula's eastern coast corresponds closely with Morrell's description of Nw South Greenland. This theory supposes that Morrell miscalculated the ship's position, perhaps because he lacked the chronometer necessary for proper navigational observation. In his account Morrell writes that he was [...] "destitute of the various nautical and mathematical instruments", although other parts of his narrative seem to indicate that the occasional dead reckoning calculation was the exception to the norm. A longitudinal error of 14° is very large, and the additional distance of about 350 mi to the Foyn coast seems too great to have been covered within the ten-day voyage from the South Sandwich Islands, where the ship's position is recorded accurately. Even so, Gould suggests that a [...] "balance of evidence" [...] shows that what Morrell saw was the Foyn coast.Filchner's view that the supposed sighting of New South Greenland could be explained by a mirage is echoed by Simpson-Housley.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The medieval King’s Mirror {{describes}} Iceland and Greenland with {{a scientific}} accuracy that is remarkable. One {{of the very}} few exceptions is the hafgerdingar in the Greenland Sea. The term translates as ‘sea hedges, ’ within which a mariner may become trapped at great peril. Many have believed that a real event was being described, although none of the proposed explanations has been totally satisfactory. The most common view currently is based on Steenstrup (1871), who explained the phenomenon as a tidal wave following a submarine earthquake. A simpler and more consistent theory is developed here: that the hafgerdingar are an optical phenomenon, specifically, a <b>superior</b> <b>mirage.</b> Such mirages, quite common in the polar regions, can produce an appearance fully consistent with the original description, as illustrated by several photographs and a computer simulation. Even the peril to seafarers has been corroborated, in the sense that such a mirage is frequently followed by a storm...|$|E
40|$|<b>Superior</b> <b>Mirage</b> {{is a body}} of {{work that}} speaks of my deep {{connection}} to place of origin and how it has shaped the way I see, think, and create art in object or written (spoken word) forms. The Great lakes area has inspired my muse for its rugged beauty and hardy souls who live, work, and, play amongst the dichotomy of nature and industry. This rugged aesthetic carries over to both the industrial giant that built this nation and the natural world of a fragile ecosystem that is in constant flux with invasive species and climate change. The balance between the economic and the environmental is very delicate because we as humans need to find viable solutions for our future generations to prosper. This dichotomy is the catalyst for the methods of how and why I create with materials/objects of both the natural and the manufactured as I believe that they need to live in harmony with each other. This body of work is a representation of what I have experienced as a rural lake dweller that appreciates the breathtaking beauty of the natural and the power of industry...|$|E
