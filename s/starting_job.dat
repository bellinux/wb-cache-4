5|$|Before the 1988 San Diego Chargers season began, Dan Fouts {{chose to}} retire from the game after 15 seasons, leaving Vlasic as the main backup to starter Mark Herrmann, {{and as a result}} the Chargers began trying to trade for an {{experienced}} quarterback. The Chargers also signed Mark Malone and Babe Laufenberg to compete for the <b>starting</b> <b>job,</b> and traded Herrmann to the Indianapolis Colts. After months of training and the 1988 preseason, Vlasic began the season as the third-string quarterback behind Malone and Laufenberg, who won the <b>starting</b> <b>job.</b> In November, after Laufenberg was injured, the Chargers decided to make Vlasic the starter instead of Malone due to the latter's ineffectiveness, as well as a six-game losing streak. He made his season debut against the Atlanta Falcons on November 13, and threw for 190 yards in a 107 victory. As a result of his performance, coach Al Saunders said that Vlasic would have the <b>starting</b> <b>job</b> {{for the rest of the}} season. Vlasic's second start came against the Los Angeles Rams where he threw for 80 yards and a touchdown. However, he suffered torn ligaments in his left knee late in the third quarter, and was lost for the season. He finished the season with 25 of 52 passes completed and a passer rating of 54.2.|$|E
5|$|Due to a {{combination}} of the Browns drafting Clifford Charlton and Junkin's desire to move back inside, the Browns planned to move him back to inside linebacker for the 1988 season. He spent training camp competing with Eddie Johnson for the second inside linebacker position alongside Mike Johnson, {{and by the end of}} preseason play, Junkin had won the <b>starting</b> <b>job.</b> In his first career start against the Kansas City Chiefs, Junkin had six tackles, including the first one of the game in a 6–3 Browns win. A month later, Junkin injured his knee, and was forced to miss several games. He returned to the team in early November, but Johnson had played so well in Junkin's absence that he spent the next few weeks as the backup inside linebacker. He was given the <b>starting</b> <b>job</b> again to end the season, but missed tackles and a lack of impact plays led to his second season being considered a disappointment.|$|E
5|$|In 1975–76, Crozier {{participated in}} only 11 games {{due to his}} {{persisting}} ailments, leaving the <b>starting</b> <b>job</b> to Gerry Desjardins.

However, the Yankees lost the 1926 World Series to the Cardinals in seven games.|$|R
5|$|Tolliver was {{selected}} by the San Diego Chargers {{in the second round}} of the 1989 NFL Draft. The Chargers traded third, fourth, and seventh-round picks in exchange for the New York Giants' second-round pick in order to draft him. Tolliver was signed on July 31, 1989, after a short holdout. He was to compete for the <b>starting</b> <b>job</b> alongside Mark Malone and David Archer, a spot which eventually went to Jim McMahon after the Chargers traded for him. As the 1989 season began with McMahon as the helm, Tolliver was slated to play the second half of the final preseason game against the Phoenix Cardinals. After 13 completions in 23 attempts, Tolliver ran the ball late in the game and broke his collarbone, sidelining him for at least six weeks. After spending the first seven games on the injured reserve list, Tolliver was taken off the list and named the starter for the game against the Seattle Seahawks on October 29, replacing McMahon who had disappointed at quarterback. In Tolliver's first start, he played three quarters, throwing six completed passes in 17 attempts for 41 yards and throwing an interception in a 10–7 loss. Tolliver subsequently lost the <b>starting</b> <b>job</b> back to McMahon. However, in late November, Tolliver was given the <b>starting</b> <b>job</b> back, remaining the starting quarterback the rest of the season. Tolliver finished the season having played five games with 89 completions in 185 attempts, 1097 yards, five touchdowns, eight interceptions, and a 57.9 quarterback rating.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} high school, Zolak played college {{football}} at the University of Maryland. He sat out his freshmen year, and became the third-string quarterback behind Dan Henning and Neil O'Donnell after two quarterbacks transferred. By {{the end of his}} sophomore season, Zolak was challenging O'Donnell for the <b>starting</b> <b>job</b> after Henning graduated. As his junior year began, in the summer of 1988, offensive coordinator Bob Valesente said that Zolak was making tremendous strides as a quarterback, but O'Donnell was the starting quarterback that year. Zolak's first collegiate appearance came against West Virginia. He completed four of six passes for 28yards, but had an interception returned for a touchdown by Bo Orlando in a 5524 loss. He appeared in four games for Maryland that season.|$|E
5|$|As with Parcells {{eight years}} previous, one of Handley's first major {{decisions}} involved replacing Phil Simms as starting quarterback. Jeff Hostetler {{was named the}} team's starter. Though the Giants won their opening game in an NFC Championship Game rematch against the 49ers, 16–14, they lost three out of their next four games to drop to 2–3. Though they rallied to finish the season 8–8, and Simms reclaimed his <b>starting</b> <b>job</b> later in the year, the excitement that surrounded the Giants the previous year was gone. One of the few promising young players to emerge on the team was second–year running back Rodney Hampton, who led the Giants in rushing with 1,059 yards.|$|E

5|$|Hester {{missed the}} third {{game of the}} season after tearing {{cartilage}} in his ribs during the previous week. He returned to the field in the team's Week 4 contest against the Philadelphia Eagles, where he caught his first touchdown of the season. Lovie Smith gave Hester his first <b>starting</b> <b>job</b> as a wide receiver the next week, in place of the injured Brandon Lloyd. Hester went on to catch five passes for 66 yards and one touchdown. In the following week, Hester totaled 87 yards on six receptions.|$|E
5|$|In early September 1994, Tolliver {{was signed}} to a {{contract}} by the Houston Oilers. He was originally the third-string quarterback, but ineffectiveness by Bucky Richardson led Tolliver to relieve him {{in a game against}} the Cleveland Browns. Tolliver played well enough to be considered for the <b>starting</b> <b>job</b> the following week due to Cody Carlson dealing with injuries. Tolliver made his first start in a game against the Raiders, but played inconsistently over seven starts and was replaced by Richardson in the season finale against the New York Jets. After finishing the season, Tolliver became a free agent and left the NFL.|$|E
5|$|On April 30, 1992 Vlasic {{signed a}} two-year {{contract}} with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, reuniting himself with former teammate Steve DeBerg. Vlasic began the preseason competing the third-string quarterback job behind Mike Pawlawski while DeBerg and Craig Erickson competed for the <b>starting</b> <b>job.</b> At the end of preseason, however, Vlasic was among the final group cut by the Buccaneers. When DeBerg was cut from the team in early November, Vlasic was re-signed to the team in his place. He remained on the roster for the 1994 preseason, but his only preseason pass was intercepted and returned for a touchdown, and he was waived shortly afterward. This {{marked the end of}} Vlasic's professional football career.|$|E

5|$|Simms won the <b>starting</b> <b>job</b> back in 1984, and Brunner was traded. The Giants had a resurgent season, {{highlighted}} by a second-half stretch where they won five of six games. Despite losing their last two to finish 9–7, they still made the playoffs. In the first round, they defeated the highly favored Los Angeles Rams 16–13 {{on the road}} before losing 21–10 to the eventual Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers. Simms threw for 4,044 yards, making him the first Giant to pass for 4,000 yards in a season.|$|E
5|$|The success didn't last long, as Johnson {{started to}} get {{hampered}} with back injuries, which reduced his effectiveness. In 1984, Johnson had surgery for a herniated disk, an injury he suffered during training camp, and {{was known as a}} potential career-ending injury. He missed {{the first game of the}} regular season against the St. Louis Cardinals and could not fully recover from the injury. Again he lost his <b>starting</b> <b>job,</b> becoming a third-down pass-rushing specialist, and was credited with seven sacks for the year; the injury forced Johnson to mull retirement.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} college, Dickinson was {{selected}} by the expansion Tampa Bay Buccaneers with the 183rd overall pick in the seventh round of the 1976 NFL Draft. Buccaneers' head coach John McKay said that Dickinson was considered the second best prospect on his draft board behind Richard Todd. Steve Spurrier had the <b>starting</b> <b>job</b> wrapped up when he was signed to the team, {{and as a result}} Dickinson spent the offseason competing for a backup quarterback spot alongside Bill Cappleman and James Foote. Dickinson started off training camp by throwing the hardest passes of the four quarterbacks, and had a few accuracy issues in the process. Dickinson served as the second-string quarterback throughout the preseason. In a game against the Green Bay Packers, he led the Buccaneers to their first touchdown as a team. By the end of preseason, his place was on the roster was solidified behind Spurrier, as Cappleman and Foote were cut and replaced by Gary Valbuena and Larry Lawrence.|$|E
