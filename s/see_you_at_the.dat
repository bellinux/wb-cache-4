500|$|Two {{days before}} his death, Ebert ended his final blog post by saying, [...] "So on this day of {{reflection}} I say again, thank you for going on this journey with me. I'll <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> movies." [...] On April 4, 2013, Ebert {{died at the age}} of 70 in Chicago as he was preparing to come home from the hospital.|$|E
6000|$|He was {{apparently}} about {{to proceed to}} do so, when Lieutenant Tappleton, who had been eyeing him with great curiosity, said with considerable scorn, 'Haven't I <b>seen</b> <b>you</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> theatre, Sir?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, if {{you would}} really like to hear, Frank, as a proof of my {{confidence}} and trust, I will tell you. You will remember that I had not <b>seen</b> <b>you</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time.' ...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the film}} Broadway Melody of 1938, Judy Garland (aged 15) sings [...] "You Made Me Love You" [...] while {{looking at a}} {{composite}} picture of Gable. The opening lines are: [...] "Dear Mr. Gable, I am writing this to you, and I {{hope that you will}} read it so you'll know, my heart beats like a hammer, and I stutter and I stammer, every time I <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> picture show, I guess I'm just another fan of yours, and I thought I'd write and tell you so. You made me love you, I didn't want to do it, I didn't want to do it..." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the return}} flight, Risner's wingman, 1st Lt. Joseph Logan, was struck in his fuel tanks by {{anti-aircraft}} fire over Antung. In {{an effort to}} help him reach Kimpo, Risner attempted to push Logan's aircraft by having him shut down his engine and inserting the nose of his own jet into the tailpipe of Logan's, an unprecedented and untried maneuver. The object of the maneuver was to push Logan's aircraft to the island of Cho Do off the North Korean coast, where the Air Force maintained a helicopter rescue detachment. Jet fuel and hydraulic fluid spewed out from the damaged Sabre onto Risner's canopy, obscuring his vision, and turbulence kept separating the two jets. Risner was able to re-establish contact and guide the powerless plane out over the sea until fluids threatened to stall his own engine. Near Cho Do, Logan bailed out after calling to Risner, [...] "I'll <b>see</b> <b>you</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> base tonight." [...] Although Logan came down close to shore and was a strong swimmer, he became entangled in his parachute shrouds and drowned. Risner shut down his own engine in an attempt to save fuel, but eventually his engine flamed out and he glided to a deadstick landing at Kimpo.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{reported}} on January 23 the sale agreement had been completed. Early reports indicated Hicks would remain a minority owner {{with the club}} and would serve on the board in a non-voting honorary position. Approval from the executive and ownership committee, the banks who were owed money by HSG, and 75% of MLB owners was still required before the sale could have been finalized. The new company would be called Rangers Baseball Express. Greenberg would serve as CEO and managing partner, and Ray Davis and Bob Simpson would be co-chairmen of the board. As {{a part of the}} original purchase agreement, Rangers Baseball Express also would acquire approximately [...] of land adjacent to Rangers Ballpark in Arlington and Cowboys Stadium. A separate company owned by Hicks owns the land. After the land sale was announced, Hicks was sued by a former partner over the land. The former partner claims Hicks never dissolved the partnership that was formed when the two groups were planning the development called Glorypark. Hicks was also sued by an architectural firm, RTKL, and a construction company, Vratsinas, for $6.9 million of unpaid work done over three years ago. Greenberg posted the following on his Facebook page after the original purchase agreement was announced:Tonight was a big night for Nolan Ryan and me as we signed the definitive agreement to purchase the Texas Rangers. Thank you to everyone for your incredible support and encouragement over the last few months. Nolan and I can't wait to get started in our efforts to bring Rangers fans everywhere what you have waited for ...all these years. Thanks again and.... <b>See</b> <b>you</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Ballpark!....... Chuck ...|$|E

6000|$|And embarrassment, {{together}} {{with the desire to}} explain, deprived her so entirely of utterance, that Maria volunteered, 'Bertha always speaks so funnily since she was ill.'
