5|$|In 1963, three African-American {{students}} {{brought a}} case against the Mobile County School Board for being denied admission to Murphy High <b>School.</b> <b>This</b> was nearly {{a decade after the}} United States Supreme Court had ruled in Brown v. Board of Education (1954) that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional. The federal district court ordered that the three students be admitted to Murphy for the 1964 school year, leading to the desegregation of Mobile County's school system.|$|E

5|$|Lützow {{graduated}} with his Abitur (university-preparatory high school diploma) on 31 March 1931 from the Schulpforta, {{a boarding school}} for academically gifted students. Unlike his brothers, who both pursued a naval career, Lützow joined the Reichswehr (Army of the Weimar Republic) following his graduation from <b>school.</b> <b>This</b> decision had been influenced by his mother's youngest brother, Eberhard Kinzel, at the time {{an officer in the}} Reichswehr and later General der Infanterie (General of the Infantry) in the Heer (German Army).|$|E
5|$|Moore {{was born}} in Melbourne in 1914. He began life drawing art classes at age 16, but was {{forbidden}} by his father from continuing because the subjects were nude.

5|$|The convent {{continued}} to be significantly expanded over the next twenty years, and in 1858 the Franciscans purchased a plot of land adjacent to the convent for the erection of a church, rectory and <b>school.</b> <b>This</b> was gifted to the local Bishop, and St George's Church was opened on the site two years later.|$|E
5|$|A new {{boarding}} house for girls was opened by Her Majesty the Queen in 2010, and in 2012, {{a new school}} building adjacent to the existing site, purpose-designed for music teaching, was opened by the Earl of Wessex (Patron of the <b>school).</b> <b>This</b> included a 100-seat recital hall and space for a 400-seat concert hall, which opens in 2017 as The Stoller Hall. The Long Millgate building continues {{to be used as}} a boys' {{boarding house}}, rehearsal and dining space, whilst the Palatine building was demolished in 2016 to reveal the previously hidden medieval buildings and allow easier access to the library.|$|E
5|$|By the 1840s, the {{boarding}} school {{had grown to}} 30 students. As the enrollment expanded, the Sibleys added new rooms to the cabin. The continued improvements created a financial strain on the school and Mary Sibley traveled to the East Coast to solicit additional funding. In the early 1850s, the school {{was on the brink}} of closing when the Sibleys offered the property to the Presbyterian Church. In 1853, the school was incorporated by special act of the Missouri Legislature and became known as the Lindenwood College for Women. The newly chartered college was placed under the control of 15 directors appointed by the Presbytery of St. Louis. On July 4, 1856, the cornerstone was laid for a new permanent brick building to replace the original log cabins. The new building, Sibley Hall, was completed in July 1857, and at the time contained the entire <b>school.</b> <b>This</b> event marked {{the beginning of a new}} era of significant growth for Lindenwood.|$|E

5|$|Governor McDaniel {{appointed}} a commission in January 1886 {{to organize and}} run the <b>school.</b> <b>This</b> commission elected Harris chairman, a position he would hold until his death. Other members included Samuel M. Inman, Oliver S. Porter, Judge Columbus Heard, and Edward R. Hodgson; each was known either for political or industrial experience. Their first task was to select a location for the new school. Letters were sent to communities throughout the state, and five bids were presented by the October 1, 1886 deadline: Athens, Atlanta, Macon, Penfield, and Milledgeville. The commission inspected the proposed sites from October 7 to October 18. Patrick Hues Mell, {{the president of the}} University of Georgia at that time, believed that it should be located in Athens with the University's main campus, like the Agricultural and Mechanical Schools.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, when Roddenberry {{was twelve}} years old, {{the family moved to}} 4906 Monte Vista in the shadow of Mount Washington, and he began {{attending}} Luther Burbank Junior High <b>School.</b> <b>This</b> was the house that Roddenberry would later describe as his childhood home. His father helped the boys obtain local jobs; Gene worked as a newspaper delivery boy and as a gas station attendant on Saturdays, and after school. The young Roddenberry moved to Franklin High School during the middle years of the Great Depression. His father was relatively unaffected by the Great Depression because of his stable employment with the police department. The family distributed food to friends and family who were in need. Glen's parents and her younger sister Willodean moved into the house for a time before finding other accommodation in Redondo Beach. During his time at Franklin, Roddenberry joined the Varsity Debate Team and {{was a member of the}} Authors Club under Mrs. Virginia Church. He graduated in 1939.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1910, Mao {{requested}} that his father permit him to attend the Dongshan Higher Primary School, which was located fifteen miles from Shaoshan; unlike the Shaoshan Primary <b>School,</b> <b>this</b> establishment taught modern subjects such as natural sciences. Yichang agreed to fund his son's tuition and dormitory space, and so the sixteen-year-old Mao set off to Dongshan with his older cousin, Wen Yunchang, who was also enrolled there. His two best friends at the school were Yunchang and Xiao Zizhang (also known as Xiao San), who would later join Mao in the communist movement and {{would become one of}} his first biographers. However, he was bullied for being rural and unsophisticated by many of his classmates, who were typically the sons of wealthy landlords from Xiangxiang district. He nevertheless proved to be a successful student, gaining the respect of his teachers through hard work, an ability to compose essays in the classical style, and voracious reading. Here, he first learned about geography, and increased his knowledge of ancient Chinese history.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1899, San Diego Normal School became the first California normal school to offer summer courses, and {{maintained}} this position until 1913. On June 21, 1900, the first class was graduated: 23 women and three men. Later that year, the east wing of the initial building was finished, adding 18 rooms. In 1903, $61,000 was appropriated by the state for a west wing; it included a gym, library, laboratories, lecture rooms, and a museum. The west wing was completed in September 1904. In 1906, the California legislature required that students have {{a high school diploma}} in order to be admitted to a normal <b>school.</b> <b>This</b> was the same requirement as for entry into the University of California.|$|E
5|$|On December 1, 2006, the Longhorns {{issued a}} {{statement}} confirming that back-up quarterback Jevan Snead had left the team and would transfer to an unspecified <b>school.</b> <b>This</b> meant {{there would be no}} scholarship quarterback available to play in the Longhorns' bowl game if McCoy was not ready. On December 21, 2006, Texas announced that McCoy was cleared to start in the Alamo Bowl. In the 2006 Alamo Bowl played on December 30, McCoy threw two touchdowns against Iowa to tie the NCAA freshman record of 29 touchdown passes established by Nevada's David Neill in 1998. This record has since been broken by Oklahoma's Sam Bradford in the 2007 season.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{marked the}} first {{appearance}} of the character Reptar. Reptar was modeled visually to resemble a Tyrannosaurus rex, but his mannerisms and actions were meant to parody that of the fictional monster, Godzilla, who {{first appeared in the}} 1954 film Godzilla, released in Japan as Gojira. Though he is portrayed comically, his name was based on a child's mispronunciation of Velociraptor, a ferocious dinosaur made iconic for its appearance in the Steven Spielberg film Jurassic Park. As noted by W. J. T. Mitchell in his book The Last Dinosaur Book, children generally begin fascination with dinosaurs between ages four and seven, while at other times during pre-school and elementary <b>school.</b> <b>This</b> demographic was the general age of Rugrats viewers, and likely the reason behind Reptar's species.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Monds was {{instrumental}} in formation of the first <b>school.</b> <b>This</b> private school was built in 1843, though Thomas Reibey converted it into St Andrews church in 1845, and the school moved elsewhere in the town. A Government school was built in 1873, next to the current recreation ground, and both schools were open as of 1883. The private school closed late in the 19th Century, but the Government school still had 65 students on the 1901 roll. The latter was a weatherboard building. It was extensively renovated in 1920 and was in use until the mid-1930s when the last school in Carrick closed. The building was relocated to nearby Hagley in 1938, though it was later demolished. In the same year the government began funding regular school transport from Carrick to the school at nearby Hagley, accompanying children from Hadspen whose school had also been closed. Since that time {{there has been no}} school in Carrick and a 1976 planning report stated the population was likely to remain insufficient to require one.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 12th century, many {{critics of the}} {{examination}} system and government-run schools initiated a movement to revive private academies. During {{the course of the}} Southern Song, the academy became a viable alternative to the state school system. Even those that were semi-private or state-sponsored were still seen as independent of the state's influence and their teachers uninterested in larger, nationwide issues. One of the earliest academic institutions established in the Song period was the Yuelu Academy, founded in 976 during the reign of Emperor Taizu (r. 960–976). The Chinese scientist and statesman Shen Kuo was once the head chancellor of the Hanlin Academy, established during the Tang dynasty. The Neo-Confucian Donglin Academy, established in 1111, was founded upon the staunch teaching that adulterant influences of other ideologies such as Buddhism should not influence the teaching of their purely Confucian <b>school.</b> <b>This</b> belief hearkened back to the writings of the Tang essayist, prose stylist, and poet Han Yu (768–824), who was certainly a critic of Buddhism and its influence upon Confucian values. Although the White Deer Grotto Academy of the Southern Tang (937–976) had fallen out of use during the early half of the Song, the Neo-Confucian philosopher Zhu Xi (1130–1200) reinvigorated it.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that {{increased}} security alone has not had a positive effect on the rate of bullying in <b>schools.</b> <b>This</b> study will empirically test the effectiveness of school resource officers as a variable of capable guardianship and its correlation with the rate and quality of bullying in <b>schools.</b> <b>This</b> research will determine if having capable guardianship, formal or informal, in the school system will {{have an effect on the}} deterrence of physical and nonphysical bullying in grade schools and high <b>schools.</b> <b>This</b> research suggests an increase in guardianship roles, will reduce the amount of bullying offenses in grade and high schools. The data will be collected by conducting qualitative interviews with police officers and school faculty regarding the use of school resource officers in the <b>school</b> systems. <b>This</b> study will allow not only the school officials, but the general public to see how an increase in guardianship has a positive effect on the bullying problem in schools...|$|R
