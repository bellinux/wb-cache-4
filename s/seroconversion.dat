5|$|The use of interferon, which {{requires}} injections daily or thrice weekly, has been supplanted by long-acting PEGylated interferon, which is injected only once weekly. However, some individuals {{are much more}} likely to respond than others, and this might be because of the genotype of the infecting virus or the person's heredity. The treatment reduces viral replication in the liver, thereby reducing the viral load (the amount of virus particles as measured in the blood). Response to treatment differs between the genotypes. Interferon treatment may produce an e antigen <b>seroconversion</b> rate of 37% in genotype A but only a 6% <b>seroconversion</b> in type D. Genotype B has similar <b>seroconversion</b> rates to type A while type C seroconverts only in 15% of cases. Sustained e antigen loss after treatment is ~45% in types A and B but only 25–30% in types C and D.|$|E
5|$|Most people {{infected}} with HIV develop specific antibodies (i.e. seroconvert) within three to twelve {{weeks of the}} initial infection. Diagnosis of primary HIV before <b>seroconversion</b> is done by measuring HIV-RNA or p24 antigen. Positive results obtained by antibody or PCR testing are confirmed either by a different antibody or by PCR.|$|E
5|$|After {{the virus}} enters the body {{there is a}} period of rapid viral replication, leading to an {{abundance}} of virus in the peripheral blood. During primary infection, the level of HIV may reach several million virus particles per milliliter of blood. This response is accompanied by a marked drop in the number of circulating CD4+ T cells. The acute viremia is almost invariably associated with activation of CD8+ T cells, which kill HIV-infected cells, and subsequently with antibody production, or <b>seroconversion.</b> The CD8+ T cell response is thought to be important in controlling virus levels, which peak and then decline, as the CD4+ T cell counts recover. A good CD8+ T cell response has been linked to slower disease progression and a better prognosis, though it does not eliminate the virus.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTThe complement-fixation test (CFT) permits {{low-cost}} {{screening of}} serum samples for different agents {{within a single}} assay, and is {{a useful tool for}} the serological diagnosis of acute respiratory infections. This study evaluated the automated Seramat CFT system with 160 paired serum samples taken from 80 patients with acute respiratory infection in comparison with in-house CFTs against a panel of agents, including influenza A and B, adenovirus, respiratory syncitial virus, cytomegalovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Coxiella burnetti and Chlamydia spp., and in comparison with indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) against Legionella pneumophila. Overall, the Seramat system identified 75 (88. 2 %) of the 85 <b>seroconversions</b> recognised by in-house CFTs or IIF. In comparison to the in-house CFTs, the correlation was 89. 2 % (66 / 74). For L. pneumophila, the Seramat system detected nine (81. 8 %) of the 11 cases diagnosed by IIF. The Seramat system also identified eight additional <b>seroconversions</b> that were not detected by the in-house assays; none of these <b>seroconversions</b> was detected by the in-house assay on retesting. The Seramat system represents a significant technical improvement that may enable many clinical laboratories to use the CFT as a routine diagnostic tool...|$|R
25|$|The gold {{standard}} for diagnosis is identification of trypanosomes in a patient sample by microscopic examination. Patient samples {{that can be used}} for diagnosis include chancre fluid, lymph node aspirates, blood, bone marrow, and, during the neurological stage, cerebrospinal fluid. Detection of trypanosome-specific antibodies can be used for diagnosis, but the sensitivity and specificity of these methods are too variable to be used alone for clinical diagnosis. Further, <b>seroconversion</b> occurs after the onset of clinical symptoms during a T. b. rhodesiense infection, so is of limited diagnostic use.|$|E
25|$|An {{independent}} evaluation of obstacles to polio eradication {{requested by the}} WHO and conducted in 2009 considered the major obstacles in detail by country. In Afghanistan and Pakistan, they concluded that the most significant barrier was insecurity; but that managing human resources, political pressures, the movement of large populations between and within both countries, inadequately resourced health facilities, also posed problems, as well as technical issues with the vaccine. In India, the major challenge {{appeared to be the}} high efficiency of transmission within the populations of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh states, set against the low (~80% after three doses against type 1) <b>seroconversion</b> response seen from the vaccine. In Nigeria, meanwhile, the most critical barriers identified were management issues, in particular the highly variable importance ascribed to polio by different authorities at the local government level, although funding issues, community perceptions of vaccine safety, inadequate mobilisation of community groups, and issues with the cold chain also played a role. Finally, in those countries where international spread from endemic countries had resulted in transmission becoming re-established—namely Angola, Chad, and South Sudan, the key issues identified were underdeveloped health systems and low routine vaccine coverage, although low resources committed to Angola and South Sudan for the purpose of curtailing the spread of polio and climatic factors were also identified as playing a role.|$|E
500|$|In all cases, HSV {{is never}} {{removed from the}} body by the immune system.

In HSV-1-infected individuals, <b>seroconversion</b> after an oral infection prevents additional HSV-1 infections such as whitlow, genital herpes, and herpes of the eye.

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to detect some {{features}} of autoreactive IgM production that interact with IgGs and normal human cellular antigens in blood sera of patients with acute respiratory viral infections caused by various factors, dependent on their age and clinical features of disease. The antibody concentrations were determined by immunoenzyme technique in paired serum samples from 750 patients and single specimens from 97 healthy persons. The results of analysis have shown that the studied types of autoreactive IgM represent a normal component of humoral immunity, since they are detectable in sufficient number of normal sera from healthy persons over 3 years old. In acute respiratory viral infections of different etiology, the rates of appropriate <b>seroconversions</b> comprised 0 to 16 % for age cohort of < 3 years old. Incidence of <b>seroconversions</b> reached 37 % among older children and adult patients with respiratory syncitial virus (RSV), or adenoviral infection, thus being 1. 7 to 5. 1 -fold higher than in patients with influenza A, or B, or parainfluenza. In cases of clinical complications of RSV or parainfluenza infections (i. e., respiratory tract obstruction, or pneumonia), the rates of <b>seroconversions</b> to autoreactive IgMs was 1. 4 to 1. 8 -fold higher than among the patients with uncomplicated clinical course of these infections.

C. pneumoniae species-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, and IgM antibodies were measured by microimmunofluorescence (MIF) in 407 sera from Helsinki. The 185 sera collected in Oulu were tested both by MIF and by commercial enzyme immunoassay (EIA). During the follow-up periods of 31 years in Helsinki and 6 years in Oulu, <b>seroconversions</b> were demonstrated by MIF in 45 % and 15 % of the study groups, respectively. In Helsinki 9 % of the persons seroconverted twice during the follow-up period.

40|$|Abstract. Temperature {{has played}} a {{critical}} role in the spatiotemporal dynamics of West Nile virus transmission throughout California from its introduction in 2003 through establishment by 2009. We compared two novel mechanistic measures of transmission risk, the temperature-dependent ratio of virus extrinsic incubation period to the mosquito gonotrophic period (BT), and the fundamental reproductive ratio (R 0) based on a mathematical model, to analyze spatiotemporal patterns of receptivity to viral amplification. Maps of BT and R 0 were created at 20 -km scale and compared throughout California to <b>seroconversions</b> in sentinel chicken flocks at half-month intervals. Overall, estimates of BT and R 0 agreed with intensity of transmission measured by the frequency of sentinel chicken <b>seroconversions.</b> Mechanistic measures such as these are important for understanding how temperature affects the spatiotemporal dynamics of West Nile virus transmission and for delineating risk estimates useful to inform vector control agency intervention decisions and communicate outbreak potential...|$|R

West Nile virus transmission was detected annually between May and October from 2005 to 2008. High temperature and low rainfall enhanced the probability of chicken <b>seroconversions,</b> which occurred in both urban and rural sites. West Nile virus was isolated from Culex quinquefasciatus and to a lesser extent, from Culex mollis/Culex inflictus, but not from the most abundant Culex mosquito, Culex nigripalpus. A calculation that combined avian abundance, seroprevalence, and vertebrate reservoir competence suggested that great-tailed grackle (Quiscalus mexicanus) is the major amplifying host in this ecosystem.

40|$|Rift Valley fever (RVF) is {{an acute}} mosquito-borne viral {{zoonosis}} whose outbreaks are {{often associated with}} prolonged rainfall and flooding, during which large numbers of vectors emerge. Recent studies into the inter-epidemic maintenance of RVF virus (RVFV) suggest that both vertical transmission in vectors and direct transmission between hosts act in combination with predisposing factors for persistence of the virus. A comparative longitudinal survey {{was carried out in}} Tana River County, Kenya, in irrigated, riverine and pastoral ecosystems from September 2014 –June 2015. The objectives were to investigate the possibility of low-level RVFV transmission in these ecosystems during an inter-epidemic period (IEP), examine variations in RVFV seroprevalence in sheep and goats and determine the risk factors for transmission. Three hundred and sixteen small ruminants were selected and tested for immunoglobulin G antibodies against RVFV nucleoprotein using a competitive ELISA during six visits. Data on potential risk factors were also captured. Inter-epidemic RVFV transmission was evidenced by 15 <b>seroconversions</b> within the irrigated and riverine villages. The number of <b>seroconversions</b> was not significantly different (OR = 0. 66, CI = 0. 19 – 2. 17, p =. 59) between irrigated and riverine areas.
