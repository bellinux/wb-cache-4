5|$|Both {{male and}} female mockingbirds sing, with the latter being {{generally}} quieter and less vocal. Male commencement of <b>singing</b> <b>is</b> in late January to February and continues into the summer and the establishing of territory into the fall. Frequency in female <b>singing</b> <b>is</b> more sporadic, as it sings less often {{in the summer and}} fall, and only sings when the male is away from the territory. The mockingbird also possesses a large song repertoire that ranges from 43 to 203 song types and the size varies by region. Repertoire sizes ranged from 14 to 150 types in Texas, and two studies of mockingbirds in Florida rounded estimates to 134 and 200, approximately. It continually expands its repertoire during its life, though it pales in comparison to mimids such as the brown thrasher.|$|E

5|$|Italian folk {{styles are}} very diverse, and include monophonic, polyphonic, and responsorial song, choral, {{instrumental}} and vocal music, and other styles. Choral singing and polyphonic song forms are primarily found in northern Italy, while south of Naples, solo <b>singing</b> <b>is</b> more common, and groups usually use unison singing {{in two or}} three parts carried by a single performer. Northern ballad-singing is syllabic, with a strict tempo and intelligible lyrics, while southern styles use a rubato tempo, and a strained, tense vocal style. Folk musicians use the dialect of their own regional tradition; this rejection of the standard Italian language in folk song is nearly universal. There is little perception of a common Italian folk tradition, and the country's folk music never became a national symbol.|$|E
5|$|The {{instruments}} used {{in musical}} entertainment are either solely the human voice (2, 6) or solely instrumental (1, 3) {{or some combination}} of the two (4, 5, 7, 8). Whether the performance is given by vocalists or instrumentalists, the performers may be soloists or part of a small or large group, in turn entertaining an audience that might be individual (10), passing by (3), small (1, 2) or large (6, 7, 8, 9). <b>Singing</b> <b>is</b> generally accompanied by instruments although some forms, notably a cappella and overtone singing, are unaccompanied. Modern concerts often use various special effects and other theatrics to accompany performances of singing and dancing (7).|$|E
5|$|Bearing a nice narrow pointed bill {{adapted for}} probing and {{catching}} insects, the red-winged fairywren is primarily insectivorous; it forages {{and lives in}} the shelter of scrubby vegetation in temperate wetter forests dominated by the karri (Eucalyptus diversicolor), remaining close to cover to avoid predators. Like other fairywrens, it is a cooperative breeding species, with small groups of birds maintaining and defending small territories year-round. Groups consist of a socially monogamous pair with several helper birds who assist in raising the young. There is {{a higher proportion of}} female helpers recorded for this species than for other species of fairywren. A variety of vocalisations and visual displays have been recorded for communication and courtship in this species. <b>Singing</b> <b>is</b> used to advertise territory, and birds can distinguish other individuals on song alone. Male wrens pluck yellow petals and display them to females as part of a courtship display.|$|E

5|$|The {{repertoire}} of Peking opera includes nearly 1,400 works. The plays are mostly taken from historical novels or traditional stories about civil, {{political and military}} struggles. Early plays were often adaptations from earlier Chinese theatre styles, such as kunqu. Nearly half of 272 plays listed in 1824 were derived from earlier styles. Many classification systems {{have been used to}} sort the plays. Two traditional methods have existed since Peking opera first appeared in China. The oldest and most generally used system is to sort plays into civil and martial types. Civil plays focus on the relationships between characters, and feature personal, domestic, and romantic situations. The element of <b>singing</b> <b>is</b> frequently used to express emotion in this type of play. Martial plays feature a greater emphasis on action and combat skill. The two types of play also feature different arrays of performers. Martial plays predominantly feature young sheng, jing, and chou, while civil plays have a greater need for older roles and dan. In addition to being civil or martial, plays are also classified as either daxi (serious) or xiaoxi (light). The performance elements and performers used in serious and light plays greatly resemble those used in martial and civil plays, respectively. Of course, the aesthetic principle of synthesis frequently leads to the use of these contrasting elements in combination, yielding plays that defy such dichotomous classification.|$|E
