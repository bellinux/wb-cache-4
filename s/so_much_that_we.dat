I think we wanted to deliver a lot, and all at once, in these two episodes". Episode co-writer Frank Spotnitz agreed, saying that when The X-Files film was being {{promoted}} with the tagline [...] "The Truth is Revealed," [...] he realized that the answers presented in the movie would not be the answers that many of the fans were wanting to hear. Spotnitz also felt that writing [...] "One Son" [...] was difficult because the episodes that gave answers seemed to be less entertaining for viewers than episodes that presented new questions. Spotnitz, however, acknowledged that this episode was necessary to help explain the complex mythology of the show; he called the episode the [...] "biggest chapter we had time to explore in the nine years we were on the air".|$|E

2500|$|In 2009, {{at least}} three stores in Seattle were de-branded to remove the logo and brand name, and remodel the stores as local coffee houses [...] "inspired by Starbucks." [...] CEO Howard Schultz says the unbranded stores are a [...] "laboratory for Starbucks". The first, 15th Avenue Coffee and Tea, opened in July 2009 on Capitol Hill. It served wine and beer and hosted live music and poetry readings. It has since been remodeled and reopened as a Starbucks-branded store. Another is Roy Street Coffee and Tea at 700 Broadway E., also on Capitol Hill. Although the stores have been called [...] "stealth Starbucks" [...] and criticized as [...] "local-washing", Schultz says that [...] "It wasn't <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were trying to hide the brand, but trying to do things in those stores {{that we did not}} feel were {{appropriate}} for Starbucks." ...|$|E

2500|$|The science {{revolution}} {{attributed to}} Thales began gaining political force, and this play offered {{a warning to}} the new thinkers. Kitto interprets the play as Sophocles' retort to the sophists, by dramatizing {{a situation in which}} humans face undeserved suffering through no fault of their own, but despite the apparent randomness of the events, {{the fact that they have}} been prophesied by the gods implies that the events are not random, despite the reasons being beyond human comprehension. Through the play, according to Kitto, Sophocles declares [...] "that it is wrong, in the face of the incomprehensible and unmoral, to deny the moral laws and accept chaos. What is right is to recognize facts and not delude ourselves. The universe is a unity; if, sometimes, we can see neither rhyme nor reason in it we should not suppose it is random.
