Writer John McNamara {{partially}} blamed Briscos low ratings on its [...] He said not many people watch television at that time, so [...] "fighting for numbers" [...] then was [...] "like being stuck on Normandy beach". Grushaw acknowledged the high quality of the show and the vocal support from its small fan base. [...] "Obviously the viewers are very passionate about the show... and when you read <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>they</b> have to say, it gives you real pause", Grushaw told USA Today in 1994. By May of that year, Grushaw said renewing Brisco was a 50–50 call. At {{the end of its}} season, Brisco was one of the lowest rated shows of the year, and Fox confirmed its cancellation in June.|$|E

60|$|Mitchell Holmes {{had only}} one fault. He lost his temper when playing golf. He seldom played a round without {{becoming}} piqued, peeved, or--in many cases--chagrined. The caddies on our links, it was said, could always worst other small boys in verbal argument by calling them <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>they</b> had heard Mitchell call his ball on discovering it in a cuppy lie. He had a great gift of language, and he used it unsparingly. I will admit {{that there was some}} excuse for the man. He had the makings of a brilliant golfer, but a combination of bad luck and inconsistent play invariably robbed him of the fruits of his skill. He was the sort of player who does the first two holes in one under bogey and then takes an eleven at the third. The least thing upset him on the links. He missed short putts because of the uproar of the butterflies in the adjoining meadows.|$|E
60|$|The Popes' keen-eyed {{inspection}} came at times, I think, dangerously near prying.

Everything was different from Hartstone Square. Daffy was perhaps more inclined to contempt, and Mrs. Pope to refined amusement and witty appreciation than Marjorie. Marjorie felt {{there was something in}} these people that she didn't begin to understand, she needed some missing clue that would unlock the secret of their confused peculiarity. She {{was one of those people}} who have an almost instinctive turn for decoration in costume and furniture; she had already had a taste of how to do things in arranging her rooms at Bennett College, Oxbridge, where also she was in great demand among the richer girls as an adviser. She knew what it was to try and fail as well as to try and succeed, and these people, she felt, hadn't tried for anything she comprehended. She couldn't quite see why it was that there was at the same time an attempt at ornament and a disregard of beauty, she couldn't quite do as her mother did and dismiss it as an absurdity and have done with it. She couldn't understand, too, why everything should be as if it were faded and weakened from something originally bright and clear.|$|E

60|$|But {{perhaps the}} finest {{feature of the}} banquet was, that nobody was half so much amazed by {{everything}} as John himself, who in his high delight was constantly bursting into fits of laughter, and then endeavouring to appear preternaturally solemn, lest the waiters should conceive he wasn't used to it. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>they</b> brought him to carve, were such outrageous practical jokes, though, {{that it was impossible}} to stand it; and when Tom Pinch insisted, in spite of the deferential advice of an attendant, not only on breaking down the outer wall of a raised pie with a tablespoon, but on trying to eat it afterwards, John lost all dignity, and sat behind the gorgeous dish-cover at the head of the table, roaring to that extent that he was audible in the kitchen. Nor had he the least objection to laugh at himself, as he demonstrated when they had all three gathered round the fire and the dessert was on the table; at which period the head waiter inquired with respectful solicitude whether that port, being a light and tawny wine, was suited to his taste, or whether he would wish to try a fruity port with greater body. To this John gravely answered that he was well satisfied with what he had, which he esteemed, as one might say, a pretty tidy vintage; for which the waiter thanked him and withdrew. And then John told his friends, with a broad grin, that he supposed it was all right, but he didn't know; and went off into a perfect shout.|$|E
