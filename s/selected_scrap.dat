50|$|The {{strategy}} {{chosen to}} replace the steam locomotive fleet initially involved the replacement of steam shunting and branch line locomotives with diesel-electric traction, {{and the movement of}} the replaced small steam locomotives to the major railway works for scrapping. In 1958 the British Transport Commission reappraised the speed of the programme, and the decision was taken to accelerate the disposal of the steam fleet. Although the capacity of the locomotive works was considerable, {{as a result of the}} 1958 acceleration the amount of storage and technical scrapping capability of the works became stretched. The British Railways Board decided to out-source via tender to <b>selected</b> <b>scrap</b> merchants the work of scrapping the steam locomotives.|$|E
40|$|The need {{to develop}} local sand binder by {{manufacturing}} industries has become necessary for national development. In this paper, the suitability of selected local sand binders on microstructural and mechanical properties of sand cast-grey cast iron was examined. The bentonite, cassava starch, rubber latex is varied for 5 w% - 11 w% fritter added to 100 % silica sand of 5 w% water. The <b>selected</b> <b>scrap</b> was superheated to 1550 oC with 0. 1 % (Fe-Si) inoculant for proper dissolution. The microhardness and tensile properties were examined using Brinnel hardness (HBN) and Instron Tensiometer (1195) for tensile values (MPa) respectively. The microstructural properties of the produced cast were examined through Nikon metallurgical microscope. Results obtained from the grey cast revealed a pearlite matrix interface, massive carbide and graphite phases. Molds bonded with bentonite and cassava starch appears better with average hardness value of 437 and 385 (HBN) respectively. The microstructure was seen {{to be dominated by}} majorly pearlite matrix with little carbide which are favorable for the formation of gray cast iron which requires low chilling in the moul...|$|E
40|$|A {{major problem}} in {{foundries}} is to <b>select</b> <b>scrap</b> alloys and pure metals {{in order to produce}} at minimum cost alloy of specified composition. We show that such problems, of realistic size, can be solved optimally by mixed-integer programming. Constraints are that the content of the alloys in various metals must be within given ranges and that the selected amount of each scrap alloy must be either zero or within a given range. The latter "zero or range" constraints can be treated implicitly in a similar way as lower and upper bounds are treated implicitly in bounded variables linear programming. Computation times for representative problems are thus reduced by a factor of three. programming, mixed-integer, implicit constraints, foundry...|$|R
50|$|The Swedish 12/70 {{system was}} slated for {{modernization}} {{in the early}} 2000s but with the 1999 decision to abandon all invasion defense it was <b>selected</b> for <b>scrapping</b> instead. One gun emplacement, gun #3 at Landsort, has been declared a State Construction Memorial and will be preserved, although it is unclear {{if it can be}} shown to the public other than on special occasions due to its remote location, modern accessibility requirements etc.|$|R
5000|$|On November 30, 2015, it was {{announced}} that the following players were <b>selected</b> by the <b>Scrap</b> Yard Dawgs in the 2015 NPF Expansion Draft: (Only Koerner and Washington actually played for the Dawgs; Low and Freeman retired before the season, and Garcia was released.) ...|$|R
60|$|The {{occasion}} was {{not long}} in coming. Half an hour after breakfast next morning, Mr. Bumble entered the shop; and supporting his cane against the counter, drew forth his large leathern pocket-book: from which he <b>selected</b> a small <b>scrap</b> of paper, which he handed over to Sowerberry.|$|R
50|$|Patch is {{the country}} of the Quilties, a land of seamtresses and quiltmakers; it lies in the Quadling {{quadrant}} of Oz. Its people have a serious problem. Their queen, Cross Patch the Sixth, has gone to pieces - literally; small pieces too. To find her successor, the land's Chief Scrapper and Prime Piercer unwind the Spool of Succession, and follow where the golden thread leads. It leads, in this instance, to the Emerald City, where it <b>selects</b> <b>Scraps,</b> the Patchwork Girl of Oz (first introduced in her eponymously titled novel, the seventh Oz book by L. Frank Baum) {{to be the new}} queen. The two Quilties, used to resistance from Queens-to-be (it's not that good a job), kidnap Scraps. Meanwhile, Peter Brown, a boy from Philadelphia, is transported by a balloon bird to the Runaway Island, where Ruggedo, the wicked Gnome King has been exiled for five years (see Kabumpo in Oz). A seaquake reveals the sunken pirate ship of Polacky the Plunderer - which contains the magic chest of Soob the Sorcerer. The chest holds several magic treasures, including a magic cloak that is supposed to render the wearer invisible and teleport him anywhere he chooses. But the cloak is torn and does not work. The ship, however, derelict as it is, allows Peter and Ruggedo to drift to the Land of Ev.|$|R
5|$|Hotspur was {{reassigned to}} the 4th Escort Group in June 1946 {{until she was}} {{refitted}} at Portsmouth Dockyard in Februaryâ€“March 1947. The ship was then assigned to the 3rd Escort Flotilla based at Portland Harbour. She was <b>selected</b> to be <b>scrapped</b> in November 1947 and was placed in reserve on 20 January 1948 pending disposal.|$|R
50|$|Surprisingly, nothing happened. Poisson was too humiliated to {{complain}} to the police. A month later, Lustig returned to Paris, <b>selected</b> six more <b>scrap</b> dealers, {{and tried to}} sell the Tower once more. This time, the chosen victim {{went to the police}} and he brought them the counterfeit contract and papers before Lustig could close the deal, but Lustig and Collins managed to evade arrest.|$|R
5000|$|The work {{consists}} of <b>scraps</b> <b>selected</b> from three anonymous contemporary Italian publications (La Giusta Statura de'Porporati, Il Nipotismo di Roma and Il Cardinalismo di Santa Chiesa; {{the last two}} by Gregorio Leti), with considerable additions of his own. The profiles were originally designed to illustrate a collection of portraits of the pope and cardinals published by Giovanni Giacomo de Rossi in 1657 called The Effigies.|$|R
40|$|Due to {{its good}} {{mechanical}} properties, the Compacted (Vermicular) graphite cast iron (CGI) {{has found a}} lot of applications in the automobilistic field. One of the applications is the production of high power diesel engine blocks that, due to the higher strength compared to the usual gray cast iron, allows the increase of the pressure inside the cylinder and, consequently, production of high level of energy. The result is the better fuel burning what decreases the fuel consumption and the pollutants' emission levels. However, when CGI replaces gray cast iron, the machining processes used to produce the components are more difficult, with lower tool lives and higher power consumption. Moreover, because usually the raw material to produce cast products of CGI is <b>selected</b> from <b>scrap,</b> some residual level of titanium is present. Thus, the goal of this work is to study the influence of the titanium content (in residual levels) in the turning operation performance with carbide tools, using two cutting speeds. The results show that the alloys with the highest titanium content generated the shortest tool life, but the titanium content influenced neither power consumption nor workpiece surface roughness. Attrition/adhesion was the main tool wear mechanisms verified in this work...|$|R
40|$|The Nuclear Materials Stabilization and Storage Division at SRS {{plans to}} {{stabilize}} <b>selected</b> plutonium <b>scrap</b> residue materials for long term storage by dissolution processing {{and plans to}} stabilize other plutonium vault materials via high-temperature furnace processing. To support these nuclear material stabilization activities, the SRS Analytical Laboratories Department (ALD) will provide characterization of materials required prior to the dissolution or the high-firing of these materials. Lab renovations to install new analytical instrumentation are underway to support these activities that include glove boxes with simulated-process dissolution and high- pressure microwave dissolution capability. Inductively-coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), inductively- coupled mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and thermal-ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) {{will be used to}} measure actinide isotopics and metallic impurities. New high-speed actinide separation methods have been developed that will be applied to isotopic characterization of nuclear materials by TIMS and ICP-MS to eliminate isobaric interferences between Pu- 238 /U- 238 and Pu- 241 /Am- 241. TEVA Resin, UTEVA Resin, and TRU Resin columns will be used with vacuum-assisted flow rates to minimize TIMS and ICP-MS sample turnaround times. For metallic impurity analysis, rapid column removal methods using UTEVA Resin, AGMP- 1 anion resin and AG MP- 50 cation resin have also been developed to remove plutonium and uranium matrix interferences prior to ICP-AES and ICP- MS measurements...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the physical and mechanical properties of strand board bonded with disposal expanded polystyrene (EPS) as binder. The strand board was manufactured using strand made from Douglas-fir beams <b>selected</b> from construction <b>scrap</b> wood. The strands were oriented, and two types of three-layer (face-core-face) strand board were manufactured: one in which the board bounded with only disposal EPS (P board), and the other in which the board bonded with disposal EPS after isocyanate compound adhesive was applied to the strand (M board). The physical and mechanical properties of the boards were evaluated based on the Japanese Industrial Standard for Particleboards (JIS A 5908). The main results obtained were as follows: bending strength properties and internal bond (IB) strength of P board had larger than those of type 18 PB and 24 - 10 PB standard. However, thickness swelling (TS) of the board was large, and the problem in water-proof property of the board remained. Bending strength properties, IB strength and TS of M board were larger than those of type 24 - 10 PB standard. The performance of M board showed equal or larger performance than those of control board...|$|R
