40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} the linear and nonlinear properties of {{photonic crystal fibre}} (PCF), describes the fabrication and characterisation of different PCFs, and demonstrates their applications to supercontinuum (SC) generation and single-photon sources. The linear properties of PCF include endlessly single-mode transmission, highly controllable dispersion and birefringence. These unique properties have made PCFs the best media to demonstrate all kinds of nonlinear effects such as self-phase modulation (SPM), cross-phase modulation (XPM), Raman effects, four-wave mixing and modulation instability (FWM and MI), and soliton effects. The combination of these nonlinear effects has led to impressive spectral broadening known as SC generation in PCFs. The intrinsic correlation of signal and idler photons from FWM has brought PCF to the application of single-photon generation. Four projects about SC generation were demonstrated. The first was visible continuum generation in a monolithic PCF device, which gave a compact, bright (- 20 dBm/nm), flat and single-mode visible continuum source extending to short wavelength at 400 nm. The second was polarised SC generation in a highly bire-fringent PCF. A well linearly polarised continuum source spanning 450 - 1750 nm was achieved with > 99 % power kept in a <b>single</b> linear <b>polarisation.</b> This polarised continuum source was then applied to tuneable visible/UV generation in a BIBO crystal. The third was residual pump peak removal for SC generation in PCFs. The fourth was to design an all-fibre dual-wavelength pumping for spectrally localised continuum generation. Two projects about photon pair generation using FWM were then demonstrated. One was an all-fibre photon pair source designed in the telecom band for quantum communication. This source achieved > 50 % heralding efficiency which is the highest in fibre photon pair sources reported so far. Another one was to design birefringent PCFs for naturally narrow band photon pair generation in the Si SPAD high detection efficiency range. 0. 122 nm bandwidth signal photons at 596. 8 nm were generated through cross polarisation phase matched FWM in a weakly birefringent PCF pumped by a picosecond Ti:Sapphire laser at 705 nm in the normal dispersion regime.

Operating at bit-rates of 10 Gbit/s and above requires compensation of the chromatic dispersion suffered in the existing fibres. Dispersion compensation with single channel chirped fibre gratings has been demonstrated on numerous occasions. Transmitting multiple WDM-channels the relative channel spacings are of great importance. The periodic spectral response and identical multiple channel characteristics of the recently developed sinc-sampled grating makes it a very attractive WDM device. DFB fibre lasers exhibit ideal source characteristics being an inherently fibre compatible device. The operating wavelengths can readily be manufactured with high accuracy to achieve a constant frequency separation using current grating writing techniques.

40|$|M. Sc. When a pure {{chromium}} {{single crystal}} is cooled through its Néel temperature, it undergoes a paramagnetic to a multi-wave vector incommensurate spin-density-wave magnetic transition. Should a chromium single crystal be cooled through its Neel {{temperature in the}} presence of a strong enough magnetic field, 4 - 5 T, then all the spin-density-wave vectors that occur as it undergoes the paramagnetic to incommensurate spin-density-wave magnetic transition, are forced to be aligned parallel to the direction of the applied magnetic field, producing what is called a single spin-density-wave wave vector state in the crystal. The single spin-density-wave wave vector state will remain in the crystal when the magnetic field is removed providing the crystal is not heated above its Neel temperature. If the crystal when in the single spin-density-wave wave vector state is orientated so that the single spin-density-wave wave vector is aligned perpendicular to the direction of an applied magnetic field, then the spin polarisation vectors of the magnetic moments will align themselves so that they are perpendicular to the applied magnetic field and perpendicular to the single wave vector, producing what is called a single spin-densitywave wave vector and <b>single</b> spin <b>polarisation</b> vector state in the crystal. There is a difference in value between the elastic constants measured when a chromium single crystal is in the single spin-density-wave wave vector state to the elastic constants measured when the crystal is in the multi-wave vector spin-density-wave state. When pure chromium is alloyed with other materials the topology of the Fermi surface is changed resulting in some of the alloys being able to undergo paramagnetic to commensurate spin-densitywave magnetic transitions, as well as being able to undergo commensurate spin-density-wave to incommensurate spin-density wave transitions.

40|$|In this thesis, I present {{experimental}} and theoretical work which assesses and develops {{a range of}} tools that are required for performing quantum information processing, particularly in photonic systems. I investigate the three degrees of freedom of a <b>single</b> photon—its <b>polarisation,</b> spatialmomentum and time-frequency distributions. For polarisation, I show that using wave plates to implement arbitrary, single-qubit rotations {{is more complicated than}} is commonly appreciated. In the spatial-momentum and time-frequency domains, I develop ways to perform tomographic analysis of quantum states, and I report the first demonstrations of these techniques. In the time-frequency domain, the tomography technique utilises entanglement in the photon polarisation as a resource to store and provide access to the time-frequency information. In my first two experiments, I use spontaneous parametric down-conversion to produce entanglement between pairs of single photons in all three degrees of freedom. I demonstrate the first characterisation of entanglement in spatial modes and the time-frequency domain, the first quantitative measurement of entangled qutrit states, and the highest quality entangled states yet measured in both polarisation and spatial modes. I also report the first realisation of complete hyperentanglement, and a full, black-box tomography of a 36 -dimensional two-photon state—the largest system to be characterised in this way to date. In my final experiment, I model and implement a new architecture for a controlled-Z gate which is much simpler to align than previous implementations. This gate requires only one non-classical interference condition, the visibility of which is the main limitation to its performance. I show that the gate operates effectively as a means of both creating entanglement and discriminating between the four elements in a basis of maximally entangled, Bell-type states. Indeed, its observed performance as a Bell analyser would be sufficient to build a quantum state teleporter which would guarantee that the recipient would be left with a better copy of an unknown input state than any eavesdropper. In a series of numerical simulations, I investigate some of the practicalities that arise when using tomographic reconstruction techniques, including how to estimate errors, which measurements to make and what is actually the optimal reconstruction. In particular, I show that tomographies perform better when based on the results from over-complete sets of measurements. Finally, I discuss the important issue of how to compare two processes, particularly when trying to assess the quality of a measured process by comparing it to some expected ideal.

40|$|Body {{composition}} measurements play {{an important}} role in nutritional studies, renal medicine and sports science, while human exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF) is an area of growing concern owing to the implementation of Directive 2013 / 35 /EU on EMF. Resonant cavity techniques offer an attractive alternative to traditional methods in these fields, as they allow rapid, non-invasive measurements without using ionising radiation. At frequencies of a few tens of MHz, a large screened room can act as a cavity resonator. A human subject inside the room perturbs its low-order resonances, and the resulting shift in frequency depends on the tissue dielectric properties, which correlate strongly with water content. This approach has been well tested and shows good agreement with current methods of measuring total body water. The number of resonant modes increases rapidly with frequency, so if we instead use microwaves at 1 GHz and above, many modes can be excited simultaneously. Adding a rotating paddle to the room creates a ‘stirred mode’ environment, where the body is effectively illuminated by microwave radiation from all directions. For EMF exposure studies this a more realistic scenario than considering only a <b>single</b> direction and <b>polarisation.</b> The average absorption cross section (ACS), which is closely related to specific absorption rate (SAR), can be rapidly obtained over a very broad band (1 GHz to 15 GHz and beyond), whereas the alternative is detailed computer simulations that take many hours for just a single frequency. At these microwave frequencies, the field penetration into tissues is a few cm, so the ACS gives useful information about the composition of tissues near the body surface. Normalising the ACS to body surface area gives us an ‘absorption efficiency’ that is independent of body size. Results will be presented of the relationship between this parameter and the thickness of subcutaneous body fat. Both techniques are comfortable for the subject, use safe levels (around 1 mW) of non-ionising radiation, and allow measurements to be made in less than 10 min...|$|R
