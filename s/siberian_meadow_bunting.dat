5000|$|The meadow bunting or <b>Siberian</b> <b>meadow</b> <b>bunting</b> (Emberiza cioides) is a {{passerine}} bird {{of eastern}} Asia [...] which {{belongs to the}} genus Emberiza in the bunting family Emberizidae.|$|E
50|$|The <b>meadow</b> <b>bunting</b> is 15 to 16.5 cm long. The male {{is mostly}} rufous-brown with dark streaks on the back. The boldly-patterned head is brown with white eyebrows, moustachial stripe and throat and grey {{sides to the}} neck. The outer tail-feathers are white and the legs are pinkish-brown. Females are similar but are duller and paler with a less {{well-defined}} head pattern.|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{classification}} and ordination of forest meadows in Southern Siberia are discussed {{on the basis of}} geographically wide ranging set of data. The classification of the meadows has been carried out using Braun-Blanquet approach. DCA ordination using DECORANA was carried out for elucidation of various macro-ecological and phytosociological regularities of the <b>meadows.</b> <b>Siberian</b> forest <b>meadows</b> were included in the order Carici macrourae-Crepidetalia sibiricae prov. of the class Molinio-Arrhenatheretea. They are both a stage of the natural succession and the first stage of the anthropogenic replacement of zonal hemiboreal forests caused by clearing of later stages as well as subsequent moderate grazing and mowing. The strong disturbance of the forest meadows over a long period results in their replacement by widespread anthropogenic types of the Arrhenatheretalia meadows...|$|R
40|$|Classification of tall-forb {{vegetation}} of the Altai {{using the}} Braun-Blanquet approach {{was carried out}} {{on the basis of}} a wide ranging set o[data from different altitudinal belts. Three main phytosociological types of the tall-forb communities were distinguished within the class MulgedioAconitetea, order Tmllio - Crepidetalia due to performed syntaxonomic analysis. The thermophilous tall-forb communities occurring in the subnemoral belt at altitudes of 259 - 700 m were included in the alliance Cacalio hastatae - Aconition septentrionalis all. nova. The montain tall-forb meadows of the dark-coniferous taiga belt (altitudes of 800 - 1700 m) were included in the alliance Triseto sibiricae-Aconirlon septentrionalis all. prov. The moderately cryophilous subalpine tall-forb communities widespread at the upper boundary of the forest belt at altitudes of 1000 - 1900 m were included in the alliance Rhaponticion carthamoidis. Altaian tall-forb vegetation shows a distinct phytosociological and plant geographical unity with European subalpine communities but the closeness of the floristic relations varies in certain altitudinal groups. Most thermophilous tall-forb <b>Siberian</b> <b>meadows</b> of the alliance Cacalio-Aconition which occur at lower altitudes demonstrate strong plant geographical relations with North and Central European meadows of the Adenostyletalia. Gradual decrease of the European floristic relations in the Altaian tall-forb meadows at higher altitudes is shown...|$|R
6000|$|If Charles Darwin {{had never}} existed at all, there {{would still have}} been a {{considerable}} and expansive evolutionary movement both in biology and in its sister sciences throughout {{the latter half of}} the present century. The harvest indeed was ready, and the labourers, though few, were full of vigour. Suppose for a moment that that earnest and single-hearted Darwinian genius had been cut off by some untimely disease of childhood at five years old, all other conditions remaining as they were, we should even so have had in our midst to-day, a small philosophical and influential band of evolutionary workers. Spencer would none the less have given us his 'First Principles' and the major part of his 'Principles of Biology,' with comparatively little alteration or omission. Wallace would none the less have promulgated his inchoate theory of natural selection, and rallied round his primordial conception the very best and deepest minds of the biological fraction. Geology would have enforced the continuity of types; Cope and Marsh would have unearthed for our edification the ancestral forms of the evolving horse and the toothed birds of the Western American deposits. The Solenhofen lithographic slates would still have yielded us the half-reptilian, half-avian Archæopteryx; the tertiary deposits would still have presented us with a long suite of gradually specialised and modified mammalian forms. The <b>Siberian</b> <b>meadows</b> would have sent us that intermediate creature which Prjevalsky recognises as the half-way house between the horses and the donkeys; the rivers of Queensland would have disclosed to our view that strange lung-bearing and gill-breathing barramunda, in which Günther discerns the missing link between the ganoid fishes on the one hand, and the mudfish and salamandroid amphibians on the other. From data such as these, biologists and palæontologists of the calibre of Huxley, Gaudry, Geikie, Rütimeyer, and Busk, would necessarily have derived, by the aid of Wallace's pregnant principle, conclusions not so very far remote from Darwin's own. Heer and Saporta would have drawn somewhat similar inferences from the fossil flora of Switzerland and of Greenland; Hooker and De Candolle would have read pretty much the self-same lessons in the scattered ferns and scanty palm-trees of oceanic islands. Kowalevsky would have seen in the ascidian larva a common prototype of the vertebrate series; the followers of Von Baer would have popularised the embryological conception of the single origin of animal life. The researches of Boucher de Perthes, of Lyell, of Evans, of Boyd Dawkins, of Keller, and of Christy and Lartet, would have unrolled before our eyes, under any circumstances, the strange story of prehistoric man. On the facts so gained, Lubbock and Tylor, Schaafhausen and Büchner, would have built up their various consistent theories of human development and human culture. In short, even without Charles Darwin, the nineteenth century would not have stood still; it would have followed in the wake of Buffon and Diderot, of Lamarck and Laplace, of St. Hilaire and Goethe, of Kant and Herschel, of Hutton and Lyell, of Malthus and of Spencer. The great world never rolls down the abysses of time obedient to the nod of one single overruling Titanic intellect. 'If the doctrine of evolution had not existed,' says Huxley, 'palæontologists must have invented it.' ...|$|R
