5000|$|M. <b>Sumper</b> and R. Luce of Eigen's {{laboratory}} {{demonstrated that}} a mixture containing no RNA {{at all but}} only RNA bases and Qβ replicase can, under the right conditions, spontaneously generate self-replicating RNA which evolves into a form similar to Spiegelman's Monster. [...] Note that despite the term self-replicating RNA, the RNA did not replicate itself: the Qβ enzyme is what made the RNA molecules.|$|E
5000|$|The next morning, {{the ladies}} {{look at their}} morning copy of The Pasadena Herald and see Brenda's photo under the front page {{headline}} [...] "Girl Victim in Bludgeon Murder" [...] and recognize her as the woman who left with the man presumed to be Mal Weston. Weston also sees the paper and realizes the victim wasn't Rebecca and calls the ladies' number, but they had already left the house to investigate and go to visit the hostess {{who is in the}} midst of bottle-feeding her baby and recognizes Brenda's photo in the paper. They then proceed to the address given by Weston to confirm if he is the same man they saw in the lounge. The door to his room is open and they go inside, commenting on his poor housekeeping. A man comes in, introducing himself as Tubbs (John Mitchum), the building manager. The ladies tell him they were paying a surprise visit to their nephew and leave. Weston calls the ladies again, but hangs up just before they walk in and pick up the phone. Hallum and Lutz arrive at Weston's apartment and learn from Tubbs that the ladies had already been there. Lutz says, [...] "Have to be the same four that were at The Velvet Trap this morning and went to see that hostess after", and Hallum replies, [...] "Looks like they got a jump on us. Got everywhere before we did." [...] The ladies' phone rings again, but they are in the midst of visiting the precinct where, as they sit waiting, a handcuffed gum-chewing miscreant (William <b>Sumper)</b> stares at them and, as he is led past them, whispers something into the ear of one of the ladies (Mildred Natwick) and she promptly faints. In the meantime, Weston still gets no answer as he keeps calling the ladies' house.|$|E
40|$|Biosilicification in diatoms 1 and sponges 2 {{potentially}} pro-mises physiological, mild reaction {{conditions for}} controlling silica structures at the nanometer scale. Since <b>Sumper</b> et al. had isolated catalytic peptides (i. e., silaffins) from diatoms, 3 {{a number of}} polymers bearing tertiary amine or ammonium groups {{have been used as}} a counterpart of silaffins to biomimetically synthesize silica structures. 4, 5 This biomimetic silicification has several advantages over conventional chemical methods. For instance, biomimetic silicification provides relatively uniform films over large areas under physiological reaction conditions without special equipment. Moreover, this method can be simply incorporated into conventional processes. 6 As a result, recent years have witnessed a grow-ing interest in the applications of biomimetic silicification, such as surface coating and patterning, 7, 8 sensors, 9 (bio) ...|$|E

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} reconstruction from electron micrographs of negatively stained cell envelopes of Halobacterium volcanii has revealed {{the structure of}} the surface glycoprotein to a resolution of 2 nm. The glycoprotein is arranged on a p 6 lattice with a lattice constant of 16. 8 nm. It forms 4. 5 nm high, dome-shaped, morphological complexes with a narrow pore at the apex opening into a `funnel' towards the cell membrane. The polarity of the structure was derived from freeze-etching experiments and `edge' views. Six radial protrusions emanate from each morphological complex and join around the 3 -fold axis to provide lateral connectivity. Using the primary structure of the surface glycoprotein of the closely related species Halobacterium halobium (Lechner and <b>Sumper,</b> 1987) and the cell envelope profile from a previous X-ray analysis of the same species (Blaurock et al., 1976) we have integrated our reconstruction into a model of halobacterial cell envelope...|$|E
40|$|Biosynthesis of sulfated saccharides {{that are}} linked to {{asparagine}} residues in the cell surface glycoprotein of Halobacterium halobium via a glucose residue involves sulfated dolichyl-monophosphoryl oligosaccharide intermediates (Lechner, J., Wieland, F., and <b>Sumper,</b> M. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 860 - 866). During isolation and characterization of these lipid oligosaccharides we detected a group of related compounds containing additional unidentified sugar residues. Here we report that: 1) the unknown sugar residues were 3 -O-methylglucose, linked peripherally to the lipid-saccharide intermediates; 2) the 3 -O-methylglucose residues in the oligosaccharides occur only at the lipid-linked level but are absent at the protein-linked level; 3) cell surface glycoprotein biosynthesis in Halobacteria in vivo is drastically depressed when S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methylation is inhibited, indicating that methylation is an obligatory step during glycoprotein synthesis. We propose a mechanism for the transport of lipid oligosaccharides through the cell membrane, involving an intermediate stage in which the saccharide moieties are transiently modified with 3 -O-methylglucose...|$|E
