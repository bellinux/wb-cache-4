40|$|We propose an {{analytical}} {{design for a}} microstrip broadband spurious-suppression filter. The proposed design uses every section of the transmission lines as both a coupling and a spurious <b>suppression</b> <b>element,</b> which creates a very compact, planar filter. While a traditional filter length {{is greater than the}} multiple of the quarter wavelength at the center passband frequency (lambda(sub g) / 4), the proposed filter length is less than (order n(Ssup th) + l) center dot lambda(sub g) / 8. The filter s spurious response and physical dimension are controlled by the step impedance ratio (R) between two transmission line sections as a lambda(sub g) / 4 resonator. The experimental result shows that, with R of 0. 2, the out-of-band attenuation is greater than 40 dB; and the first spurious mode is shifted to more than 5 times the fundamental frequency. Moreover, it is the most compact planar filter design to date. The results also indicate a low in-band insertion loss...|$|E
40|$|The maize (Zea mays) pollen-predominant gene Zm 908, a novel small-peptide gene, was {{reported}} to play critical roles in pollen germination and pollen tube growth in our previous work. In this study, we aimed to explore the regulatory mechanism of Zm 908. The putative promoter of Zm 908 was cloned and analyzed. The activity analysis {{of a series of}} promoter truncations in different tissues of transgenic tobacco plants indicated that the Zm 908 promoter is pollen-specific and that the – 126 to – 68 region is crucial for pollen expression. The 5 ′ deletion analysis of the – 126 to – 68 region revealed that the – 126 to – 102 region functions as a transcriptional <b>suppression</b> <b>element.</b> ZmDof 30, which is predominantly expressed in pollen and whole anthers, was cloned and characterized. ZmDof 30 -GFP localized to the nuclei of maize protoplasts and possessed no transcriptional activation activity in a yeast system. ZmDof 30 could bind to the AAAG elements in p 184 sequence containing the – 126 to + 58 region of the Zm 908 promoter in vitro and in vivo, and negatively regulated p 184 activity in tobacco leaves. Collectively, ZmDof 30 may function as a Zm 908 transcriptional repressor in pollen, and these results may provide {{a better understanding of the}} regulation of the Zm 908 gene. Additionally, the pollen-specific Zm 908 promoter may be valuable for genetically engineering male sterility...|$|E

40|$|Stimulated Raman {{scattering}} in {{optical fibers}} can be suppressed by different techniques, {{which include the}} use of special fiber designs (that work as distributed spectral filters) or the use of lumped filtering elements. Fiber designs like the w-type profile are limited in maximum fiber core size and provide Raman attenuations of a few dB/m.

In these applications lumped filters could provide a better and more flexible solution. Thus, in this work lumped filters will be evaluated as Raman <b>suppression</b> <b>elements</b> in passive fibers as well as in active Yb-doped fibers for amplifier and laser applications.

30|$|Although {{the results}} are fully {{coherent}} in their present form, the addition (or <b>suppression)</b> of <b>elements</b> may drastically modify the outputs of the multivariate analysis. The environmental question must therefore always be kept in mind, so that only those elements supposed to be of interest are processed; the sought-after signals might otherwise be obscured. The transformations required to process the compositional data properly mean that the original concentration values are no longer directly present. This loss of contact can be a serious problem in certain studies, such as those undertaken for ecotoxicological evaluation, where the knowledge of pollutant levels is of paramount importance. The compositional biplot conveys only relative information because of the compositional structure of the data, so that loadings cannot be interpreted separately, but only as pairs or groups of variables. Such grouping may make the overall picture less easy to understand. It is therefore strongly recommended to use compositional data analyses as a complement to the traditional approach (which consists in closely examining raw concentration levels in lichens, possibly also using concentration normalization), when mapping a synthetic contamination index, or for in-depth studies of the associations between variables, or between individuals.|$|R

Nodular and non-nodular tissue specimens were collected from 63 patients undergoing thyroidectomy. 32 had received preoperative TSH suppressive therapy with TSH levels consistently below 0. 5 mU/l (L-T 4 group). TSH suppression had not been used in the other 31, and their TSH levels were normal (0. 8 - 4 mU/l (control group). Quantitative RT-PCR was used to measure mRNA levels for TSH receptor, IGF 1, IGF- 1 receptor, insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate 1 in nodular and non-nodular tissues from the 2 groups.

40|$|Thirty {{years ago}} Breneman and Stone {{observed}} that the enhancement or <b>suppression</b> of <b>element</b> abundances in large solar energetic-particle (SEP) events varies as a power of the mass-to-charge ratio, A/Q, of the elements. Since Q during acceleration or transport may depend upon the source plasma temperature T, the pattern of element enhancements can provide a best-fit measure of T. The small SEP events we call 3 He-rich or "impulsive" show average enhancements, relative to coronal abundances, rising as the 3. 6 power of A/Q to a factor of ~ 1000 for (76 <=Z<= 82) /O and temperature in the range 2 - 4 MK. This acceleration is believed to occur in islands of magnetic reconnection on open field lines in solar flares and jets. It has been recently found that the large shock-accelerated "gradual" SEP events have {{a broad range of}} source plasma temperatures; 69 % have coronal temperatures of T < 1. 6 MK, while 24 % have T ~ 3 MK, the latter suggesting a seed population containing residual impulsive suprathermal ions. Most of the large event-to-event abundance variations and their time variation are largely explained by variations in T magnified by A/Q-dependent fractionation during transport. However, the non-thermal variance of impulsive SEP events (~ 30 %) exceeds that of the ~ 3 MK gradual events (~ 10 %) so that several small impulsive events must be averaged together with the ambient plasma to form the seed population for shock acceleration in these events.

40|$|Genomes must balance active <b>suppression</b> of transposable <b>elements</b> (TEs) {{with the}} need to {{maintain}} gene expression. In Arabidopsis, euchromatic TEs are targeted by RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). Conversely, active DNA demethylation prevents accumulation of methylation at genes proximal to these TEs. It is unknown how a cellular balance between methylation and demethylation activities is achieved. Here we show that both RdDM and DNA demethylation are highly active at a TE proximal to the major DNA demethylase gene ROS 1. Unexpectedly, and in contrast to most other genomic targets, expression of ROS 1 is promoted by DNA methylation and antagonized by DNA demethylation. We demonstrate that inducing methylation in the ROS 1 proximal region is sufficient to restore ROS 1 expression in an RdDM mutant. Additionally, methylation-sensitive expression of ROS 1 is conserved in other species, suggesting it is adaptive. We propose that the ROS 1 locus functions as an epigenetic rheostat, tuning the level of demethylase activity in response to methylation alterations, thus ensuring epigenomic stability.

Such studies can predict which rainfall event may lead to non-compliance. The underlying assumption is that the only factors that can influence the discharge risk are rainfall and runoff.

This influence has been studied with Raman and FT-IR spectroscopies, Archimedean density measurements, chemical durability in 90 °C water and finally by studying of the ultrasonically measured elastic properties, such as Young’s and shear modulus and Poisson’s ratio, of the resultant glasses. The experimental results showed that the glass structure is predominantly comprised from tetrahedral and trigonal borate units and silicon and/or aluminium tetrahedral units.
