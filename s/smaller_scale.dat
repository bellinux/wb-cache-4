40|$|The {{interest}} {{in the development and}} restructuring of the New Zealand economy with increasing emphasis upon industrial development has seen the emergence of what has been termed the 'Small Scale High Value' concept. The dichotomy of firms which are <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> and producing high unit value products would seem appropriate to the New Zealand economy which is characterised by smallness. Two major considerations are involved. First there is the conceptual problem of <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> firms. This necessitates the evaluation of the <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> concept and the recognition of the main characteristics and advantages of <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> operations. This evaluation builds a conceptual framework within which <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> firms in New Zealand can be assessed and their contribution and potential contribution to the New Zealand economy placed in perspective. This raises the second major focus, that of an empirical study identifying and examining <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> firms within the New Zealand context. The need is to ascertain the contribution of the <b>Small</b> <b>Scale</b> High Value firms to the New Zealand economy {{and the extent to which}} government or industrial policy should be directed to their assistance. A number of authors have promoted <b>Small</b> <b>Scale</b> High Value firms as worthy of special attention due to their characteristics and advantages being suitable to the structural development and growth of the national economy. These special features or characteristics associated with <b>Small</b> <b>Scale</b> High Value firms include: flexibility and versatility, good labour relations, export orientation, technology orientation, inventiveness and innovation as well as being footloose. The combination of these 'special' qualities is seen to provide the <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> firms with comparative advantages. Discussion centres upon establishing the validity or otherwise of these qualities. <b>Small</b> <b>Scale</b> firms have also been applied to an urban hierarchy framework focusing on their spatial location within New Zealand and the implication these hold for Industrial and Regional development policy...|$|R

In order for a nation to utilize food power effectively, the nation must effectively apply and display scarcity, supply concentration, demand dispersion, and action independence. The four main nations that export enough agriculture to be able to exert food power are the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.

40|$|M. Ing. (Engineering Management) Abstract: Literature {{has shown}} {{that a number of}} {{concerns}} have been raised with regards to the definition of <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> mining. It has been argued that the formal definition does not capture all the intricacies of <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> mining. The definition {{does not take into account}} the level of technology deployed, production output, nature and motivation of miners etc. The objectives of the research conducted were to firstly develop a formal and scientific definition for <b>Small</b> <b>Scale</b> Mining in South Africa and secondly to use and apply Engineering Management concepts to optimise and improve the productivity of selected <b>Small</b> <b>Scale</b> Mining and Minerals Processing operations in South Africa. The methodology used involved conducting a literature review of the types of <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> mining and mineral processing operations that exist within South Africa. A case study approach was used and a questionnaire was developed to gather information from selected legal <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> mining and processing operations in South Africa. A survey was developed and submitted to experts/specialists in the field of <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> mining in order to use the Pairwise Comparison Decision Making Tool to develop a scientific definition of <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> mining. By comparing the information studied in the literature with the data obtained from visiting two <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> operations (semi-precious gemstones and diamonds) and using engineering management concepts it was found that the recommended improvements that one can make to <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> mining and minerals processing operations in South Africa can essentially be categorised into four critical areas namely: Management, Chemical Analysis, Technology and Skills. These areas are captured in more detail in the Integrated Management Model proposed for <b>Small</b> <b>Scale</b> Mining and Minerals Processing Operations in South Africa within this dissertation. All aims and objectives set-out for the research conducted were achieved. The recommended improvements if implemented by <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> mining and mineral processing operations in South Africa will result in a safer and healthier working environment, increased productivity, higher production rates and improved profitability...|$|R
