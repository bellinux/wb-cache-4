Krause also claimed that the demonstration {{was recorded}} without his knowledge and nor would he have given his consent, since his playing was a preview of a piece he intended to include on the next Beaver & Krause album.

30|$|Among the {{conventional}} pattern technologies of printed electronics based on <b>silver</b> nanoparticle <b>inks,</b> inkjet printing {{is the most}} widely applied due to its great potential {{for a variety of}} substrates as well as high-throughput and cost-effective system. <b>Silver</b> nanoparticle <b>inks</b> were directly ejected from the nozzle to the substrate and then sintered at about 140 °C[*]~[*] 250 °C for 5 min to form final conductive patterns[15 – 17]. <b>Silver</b> nanoparticle <b>inks</b> based on inkjet printing are still hampered from practical application due to the reasons below. Firstly, solution properties including ink viscosity, surface tension, and solubility have a significant influence on the preparation of printed patterns[18]. The complex film preparation and drying process for different types of <b>silver</b> nanoparticle <b>inks</b> restrict their potential for reproducible conductive patterns[19, 20]. Secondly, the coalescence of subsequently ejected ink droplets would cause edges in a type of wave rather than a straight line. Although this phenomenon could be modified by adjusting the component of the solvent, the wave-like edge is hard to avoid which would be even worse accompanied with the patterns at the nanometer scale, leading to conduction between the adjacent lines detrimental to the device[21]. Besides, both the low printing speed of inkjet printing and general time-consuming post sintering process hinder the potential of <b>silver</b> nanoparticle <b>inks</b> for the cost-effective fabrication of printed electronics[22].|$|R

30|$|In conclusion, {{spray coating}} method was {{successfully}} {{applied for the}} fabrication of accurate nanoscale conductive patterns consisting of <b>silver</b> nanoparticle <b>inks.</b> Homogeneous and highly conductive patterns with low Rsq less than 1 Ω/cm 2 were obtained by optimizing the spray coating parameters. Meanwhile, in situ sintering was incorporated to facilitate the sintering process, leading to less time consumption and lower energy cost compared to the general post sintering process. Finally, the potential of <b>silver</b> nanoparticle <b>inks</b> for printed electronics was also testified by fabricating an inverted PSC based on the spray-coated silver electrode, which exhibited a high PCE of 2.76 %.

40|$|The direct write {{technology}} {{provides an}} interesting opportunity for plugging blind via holes {{as a more}} precise alternative to currently used screen printing processes. This technology provides a complete, void-less filling of the via and fabrication of the interconnects extending from the via in one single step. After deposition, the material is heat treated (sintered) to densify into a highly conductive solid. Sintering is usually accomplished by laser treatment. Some aspects of this relatively new technology, especially these related to {{the relationships between the}} laser sintering process and the deposited material properties are still largely unexplored.

LIFT {{was carried out}} by a KrF excimer laser (248 nm, 35 ns) using two donor substrate configurations: (a) a wet <b>silver</b> NP <b>ink</b> layer spread on a quartz substrate and (b) a wet <b>silver</b> NP <b>ink</b> layer spread on a quartz substrate covered by a 40 nm thick titanium layer. This comparative study revealed a completely different ejection mechanism for the two different donor configurations. The use of the titanium dynamic release layer (DRL) resulted in a highly directional and low velocity ejection of the material {{for a wide range of}} laser fluences. On the other hand, LIFT of <b>silver</b> NP <b>ink</b> without using the titanium DRL provoked supersonic velocity ejection and shock wave generation for laser fluences even slightly above the ejection threshold. The velocity of the ejected material (13 - 240 m/s) in the case of titanium DRL assisted LIFT was significantly lower than the one observed without using DRL (106 - 830 m/s).
