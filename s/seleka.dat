5|$|In January 2013, {{the rebels}} {{terminated}} their operations, {{hoping for a}} negotiated settlement. Following a ceasefire and a power-sharing agreement, <b>Séléka</b> and Bozizé agreed to honour the rebel's demands {{for the release of}} rebel prisoners and the expulsion of foreign troops from the country. The agreement allowed Bozizé to complete his term in office and to include members of <b>Séléka</b> in a new government. It was also agreed that fresh elections would be held in 2016. The agreement was not honoured and the rebels captured Bangui on 23 March 2013, forcing Bozizé to flee the capital.|$|E
5|$|In late 2012, the <b>Séléka</b> {{coalition}} {{rebelled against}} his autocratic rule {{and entered the}} city. After capturing Bria, Sibut, and other important towns, {{they were on the}} verge of capturing Damara, the last strategic town before Bangui. France and the US refused to support the president and neighbouring countries reinforced the Central African Multinational Force (Fomac).|$|E
25|$|Further {{reports of}} {{cannibalism}} were reported against the <b>Seleka</b> Muslim minority during the ongoing Central African Republic conflict.|$|E
5000|$|The {{increasing}} {{violence was}} largely from reprisal attacks on civilians from <b>Séléka's</b> mainly Muslim fighters and Christian militias called [...] "anti-balaka", meaning 'anti-machete' or 'anti-sword'. As many Christians had sedentary lifestyles and many Muslims were nomadic, {{claims to the}} land were yet another dimension of the tensions.|$|R
2500|$|By {{the end of}} {{the year}} there were {{international}} warnings of a [...] "genocide" [...] and fighting was largely from reprisal attacks on civilians from <b>Seleka's</b> predominantly Muslim fighters and Christian militias called [...] "anti-balaka." [...] By August 2013, there were reports of over 200,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) ...|$|R
50|$|Grobler made no {{immediate}} advance. He fretted over {{the failure of}} the northward thrust of the Marico and Rustenburg forces up the railway towards Mahalapye. Characteristically impatient, he withdrew with 400 men in a feint to the south and re-appeared in the north at Rhodes' Drift, near Tuli, to reinforce the Soutpansberg commando of Commandant van Rensburg - against the British Rhodesian forces of Colonel Plumer. Grobler's request to invade Rhodesia with van Rensburg was turned down by Pretoria. So, on or about November 5, Grobler came once again to camp at <b>Seleka's</b> village, with reinforcements from the Soutpansberg commando. There were now reportedly at <b>Seleka's</b> 637 Boers with 97 waggons and 4 field-pieces, together with about 750 armed African auxiliaries. Khama dispatched another regiment of 370 men to Ngwapa hill, a natural fortress that stood high above the valley - making a total of 700 defenders there.|$|R
25|$|French President François Hollande {{called on}} the UN Security Council and African Union to {{increase}} their efforts to stabilize the country. On 18 February 2014, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon {{called on the}} UN Security Council to immediately deploy 3,000 troops to the country, bolstering the 6,000 African Union soldiers and 2,000 French troops already in the country, to combat civilians being murdered in large numbers. The <b>Séléka</b> government {{was said to be}} divided. and in September 2013, Djotodia officially disbanded <b>Seleka,</b> but many rebels refused to disarm, becoming known as ex-Seleka, and veered further out of government control. It is argued that the focus of the initial disarmament efforts exclusively on the <b>Seleka</b> inadvertently handed the anti-Balaka the upper hand, leading to the forced displacement of Muslim civilians by anti-Balaka in Bangui and western CAR.|$|E
25|$|On 10 December 2012, the {{conflict}} restarted with rebel groups accusing President Bozizé {{of violating the}} terms of their earlier agreement. The new rebel coalition, known as <b>Séléka,</b> overthrew Bozizé and took the capital, Bangui, on 24 March 2013, and rebel leader Michel Djotodia declared himself President of the Central African Republic.|$|E
25|$|It {{was also}} {{reported}} by the Afrikaans Daily newspaper, Beeld, that on 23 March 2013 when the <b>Séléka</b> rebel group attempted to take power in the Central African Republic by invading the capital of Bangui, four armed Gripen Fighter aircraft from 2 Squadron SAAF were sent along with a C-130BZ transport aircraft (reportedly carrying a stock of bombs) {{in order to provide}} close air support to the 200-strong South African garrison who were still fighting in the city. The aircraft were, however, recalled shortly after, as the South Africans and the rebels agreed to a ceasefire and rather opted to withdraw peacefully from the country. Several flights made by C-130BZ aircraft evacuated the bodies of the 13 South African soldiers who were killed and the 27 who were wounded during the <b>Séléka</b> offensive and also the remainder of the deployed soldiers and their equipment after the ceasefire was declared. The deployment of the Gripen fighter aircraft indicated that if the situation called for it, the country will deploy its fighter aircraft in order to ensure the protection of its assets.|$|E
50|$|Palapye had {{received}} news on October 16, 1899 that the Waterberg commando, under Assistant Commandant-General Frederick A. Grobler, was assembling {{on the eastern}} side of the Limpopo at <b>Seleka's</b> (opposite Ngwapa), near the drift later marked on South African maps as Groblersbrug. The next day Khama ordered out the Maolola (or Mafhiri) regiment, under his brother Kebailele, to guard the Mahalapye railway bridge.|$|R
50|$|On Tuesday, November 7, 1899, the {{combined}} Transvaal forces crossed the Limpopo and fired four shells at Ngwapa. They then doubled {{back across the}} river and began to build an earth-walled fort. There were no casualties on either side in the skirmish. Satisfied with this display of force, the concentration of Boer forces at <b>Seleka's</b> then dispersed north and south along the Bechuanaland front.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the months}} that {{followed}} <b>Séléka's</b> takeover, the group was criticized for continuing to perpetrate violence against civilians. Djotodia was formally sworn in as President on 18 August 2013. On that occasion he said that he hoped to be [...] "the last of my countrymen to have to take up arms in order to come to power". He also vowed that he would not stand as a presidential candidate.|$|R
25|$|The LRA was {{reported}} to be in the East CAR town of Djema in 2012 but forces pursuing the LRA withdrew in April 2013 after the government of the CAR was overthrown by the <b>Séléka</b> Coalition rebels. In November 2013, Kony {{was reported}} to be in poor health in the East CAR town of Nzoka and Michel Djotodia, president of the CAR, claimed he was negotiating with Kony to surrender. US officials doubted that Kony genuinely wanted to surrender.|$|E
2500|$|On 11 January 2014, Michael Djotodia and Nicolas Tiengaye {{resigned}} {{as part of}} a deal negotiated at a regional summit in neighboring Chad. [...] Catherine Samba-Panza was elected as interim president by the National Transitional Council, becoming the first ever female Central African president. On 23 July 2014, following Congolese mediation efforts, <b>Séléka</b> and anti-balaka representatives signed a ceasefire agreement in Brazzaville. By the end of 2014, the country was de facto partitioned with the anti-Balaka in the southwest and ex-Seleka [...] in the northeast. On 14 December 2015, <b>Séléka</b> rebel leaders declared an independent Republic of Logone.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2012, <b>Séléka,</b> a {{coalition}} of rebel groups, took over towns in the northern and central regions of the country. [...] These groups eventually reached a peace deal with the Bozizé's government in January 2013 involving a power sharing government but this deal broke down and the rebels seized the capital in March 2013 and Bozizé fled the country.|$|E
5000|$|Though [...] "anti-balaka" [...] {{is often}} {{translated}} as [...] "antimachete", its origin is explained: {{is from the}} language of the young illiterates, who formed <b>Seleka’s</b> armed opposition, and who chased the Muslim ‘anti-balles à ti laka’ (anti ti laka bullets). The term ‘laka’ in the street language of the Central African Republic means an AK-47. The anti-balakas are therefore the bearers of grigris meant to stop Kalashnikov bullets.|$|R

5000|$|In November 2013, the UN {{warned the}} country was at risk of {{spiralling}} into genocide {{and said it was}} [...] "descending into complete chaos", while France described the country as [...] "...on the verge of genocide." [...] The increasing violence was largely from reprisal attacks on civilians from <b>Sélékas</b> mainly Muslim fighters and Christian militias called [...] "anti-balaka", meaning 'anti-machete' or 'anti-sword'.
