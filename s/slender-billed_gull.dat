40|$|Acquired {{carbapenemases}} currently pose one of {{the most}} worrying public health threats related to antimicrobial resistance. A NDM- 1 -producing Salmonella Corvallis was reported in 2013 in a wild raptor. Further research was needed to understand the role of wild birds in the transmission of bacteria resistant to carbapenems. Our aim was to investigate the presence of carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli in gulls from southern France. In 2012, we collected 158 cloacal swabs samples from two gull species: yellow-legged gulls (Larus michahellis) that live in close contact with humans and <b>slender-billed</b> <b>gulls</b> (Chroicocephalus genei) that feed at sea. We molecularly compared the carbapenem-resistant bacteria we isolated through culture on selective media with the carbapenem-susceptible strains sampled from both gull species and from stool samples of humans hospitalized in the study area. The genes coding for carbapenemases were tested by multiplex PCR. We isolated 22 carbapenem-resistant E. coli strains from yellow-legged gulls while none were isolated from <b>slender-billed</b> <b>gulls.</b> All carbapenem-resistant isolates were positive for bla(VIM- 1) gene. VIM- 1 -producing E. coli were closely related to carbapenem-susceptible strains isolated from the two gull species but also to human strains. Our results are alarming enough to make it urgently necessary to determine the contamination source of the bacteria we identified. More generally, our work highlights the need to develop more bridges between studies focusing on wildlife and humans in order to improve our knowledge of resistant bacteria transmission routes...|$|R

40|$|Ile aux Oiseaux, a small {{barrier island}} on the south-westen {{fringe of the}} Saloum Delta, Senegal, grows {{at a rate of}} about 100 in's per year in south-easten direction. It hosts an {{impressive}} breeding population of royal tens (Sterna maxima), caspian terns (Sterna caspia), <b>slender-billed</b> <b>gulls</b> (Larus genei) and grey-headed gulls (Larus cirrocephalus). All these are ground-breeding birds, and very vulnerable to predation and human disturbance. The Saloum Delta National Park's administration is trying to set up an effective protection against intruders. Ideally the expected breeding areas should be picketed off before the breeding season's start. In order to determine beforehand which areas are to be declared off-limits one should know which criteria the birds use for selecting the breeding sites. From 1998 till 2003 I undertook detailed annual surveys of the island's topography, its vegetation and the location of breeding colonies. The colonial species, i. e. royal terns, caspian terns and <b>slender-billed</b> <b>gulls</b> consistently showed preference for the vicinity of new beach crests, either on bare sand or where the vegetation was still low. Some colonies however are found inland, be it on former beach crests or on former beaches.

Some non-breeding seabird species, such as gannets, skuas, and Chlydonias spp. terns were also recorded in small numbers. Nevertheless, species diversity of the seabird community associated with trawlers was significantly higher at the Ebro than at Majorca, because Procellariiformes, which breed only in the latter area, were displaced by large numbers of gulls.

40|$|This bird report {{covers the}} years 1986 - 1987 {{and is a}} sequel to the bi-annual reports begun in the 1930 's of the maj or ornithological events {{recorded}} in the Camargue and neighbouring Crau and Alpilles. Several researchers present the results of long-term monitoring programmes and there are observations of rare species (but only those accepted by the Rareties Committee) or the more regular ones recorded in unusual numbers, or outside the normal dates of presence in the region. There were spells of severely cold weather in February 1986 and again, for the 3 rd consecutive winter, in January 1987, this latter being the more severe of the two. Flamingos and egrets suffered less than in January 1985 but passerines were hard hit, particularly Cetti's and Fan-tailed warblers and Bearded Tits. Rainfall over the two years was quite high {{and as a result}} the salinity of the Vaccarès lagoon dropped from 33 g/l to only 20 g/l by the end of 1987. All european grebes have been recorded in the delta and their numbers have increased on the Vaccarès where 1 000 or more Great-crested and around 3 000 Black-necked were censused both years. The Grey Heron breeding population continues to increase and there were a record 891 pairs censused in the Camargue area in 1986. In winter the Great White Heron is now a regular visitor with up to 35 individuals. Storks are still regular on migration with 8 Black and 43 White in autumn 1987. Record numbers of flamingos were again breeding in 1986 and 1987 with 20 000 and 17 500 pairs respectively and a record 8 590 chicks raised in 1986. In 1987, only 2 200 chicks were raised because of disturbance caused by a child's balloon blown onto the breeding island during hatching. The banding programme continues and 600 chicks were marked each year. During the cold spell of January 1987 about 100 flamingos died, one of the victims being marked with an Iranian ring from Lake Rezaiyeh. Waterfowl counts revealed record numbers of Shelducks in February, with 2 745 in 1986 and 3 590 in 1987. The Mute Swan breeding population continues to increase in the area and the Bewick's peaked at 105 in January 1986. A small flock of Grey-lag Geese now winters in the Camargue and one bird has been seen wearing a Swedish ring. Midwinter counts of ducks and coots have now been made over 24 consecutive seasons. Although Gadwall and Shoveler numbers have increased in recent years the overall numbers of ducks have decreased for the thirteenth consecutive winter. This decline is attributed mainly to excessive hunting and an increase in the salinity of Camargue lagoons. Other notorious winter visitors to the delta have been Sea and Booted Eagles in 1986 and 1987, and 7 cranes in 1986. Amongst the rarer waders is the 4 th record of a Pectoral Sandpiper, a spring report of Buff-breasted Sandpiper and several observations of Wilson's Phalarope, Terek Sandpjper and Black-winged Pratincole.

40|$|This bird report {{covers the}} years 1978 and 1979 and completes {{a period of}} 30 years of {{observations}} by a contingent of resident and visiting ornithologists in the Rhône delta and neighbouring Crau and Alpilles. It presents not only observations of rare species or unusual numbers of birds, but also indicates the results of several long term monitoring programmes concerning in particular, waterfowl and allied species. A climatological report summarizes the most important meteorological phenomena of the two years, the most striking of which were the very wet spring of 1978 and the dry summer of 1979. The winter of 1978 - 1979 must surely be remembered in northern and central Europe {{as one of the}} most severe this century. In the Mediterranean, however, it was much less severe and, fortunately, had none of the disastrous effects of the previous hard winters of 1956 and 1962 - 1963. "La Crau", a unique stony desert area and former delta of the River Durance, is suffering seriously from the spread of industry and from agricultural reclamation. Some of the first census work to be carried out here shows just how important the area is for breeding Stone Curlews, Little Bustards and Pin-tailed Sandgrouse in particular. The sandgrouse population is an isolated one, the species occurring elsewhere in Europe only in parts of Spain. Observations of sea birds are not carried out systematically and more thorough sea-watching would probably show that many of the species mentioned here are regularly wintering in the "Golfe du Lion". Unusually high numbers of Black-necked Grebes appear each autumn in the saline "Etang de Lavalduc" (up to 4, 500), which makes it an internationally important site for this species. Whilst the herons as a group maintain their numbers, several notable changes have taken place in recent years. The reed-nesting Grey Heron continues to increase whilst the Purple clearly shows the opposite trend. The Cattle Egret, occuring only as an accidentai visitor less than 15 years ago, appears now to have reached the peak of colonisation with the numbers of breeding pairs levelling off. Autumn roost counts show the total of individuals at close to 2, 000. The first indications of roughly how many Bitterns breed in the Camargue are given whilst the second only record of White Storks breeding in the delta involved one semi-captive male and a wild female carrying a ring. This was a chick transplanted from Morocco to a nest in Alsace as part of a reintroduction programme in 1975. The flamingos again had two successful breeding seasons and the summer population for the south coast of France peaked at over 35, 000 birds both years. Particularly interesting data are being gatbered from the sightings of "Darvic-ringed" birds, 1858 of which have thus been marked over the past three years. 24 % of these have already been read outside France. Amongst the Anseriiformes, the wintering Bewick's Swan population was the highest yet recorded with a maximum of 85 in January 1979. During this same period four species of geese were present with Greylags and Bean's bath reaching one hundred or more individuals. Counts of Shelducks have shawn how important the salines are bath as a breeding area and winter quarters, and a ringing programme has thrown some light on their movements. For other ducks the overall wintering population has been quite high with a peak of 122, 000 in January 1979. In general the number of diving ducks was below average but this was compensated for by several of the surface feeders being present in large numbers, in particular Teal, Gadwall and Shoveler. The list of raptor observations is as impressive as ever and includes a second estimate of the breeding Marsh Harrier population with results slightly superior to those obtained ten years earlier. The eighth complete census of breeding Lara-limicoles was carried out in the brackish and salt water zone of the greater Camargue area. All species are maintaining their numbers and attention is drawn to the increasing populations of Mediterranean and <b>Slender-billed</b> <b>Gulls.</b> Nearctic waders already observed in the delta included sightings of Buff-breasted Sandpiper and Wilson's Phalarope whilst the Pectoral was only the second reported.

40|$|This paper {{continues}} {{the series of}} publications reporting interesting observations and data collected in the Camargue and neighbouring areas (Crau, Alpilles) since 1930. For several species and groups of birds long-term monitoring is carried out and this is done primarily by ornithologists from the Tour du Valat, the C. N. R. S. Ecology Centre and the National Nature Reserve. From the climatological report {{it can be seen}} that there was a severe cold spell in January 1985, with freezing conditions lasting two weeks. Flamingos were severely affected as were several species of ducks (Figure 3), herons and waders. Of the two mainly sedentary warblers Fan-tailed seem to have suffered more than Cetti's. This cold spell caused the sharp decline in the numbers of breeding Little egrets (Table 1) and Cattle egrets though this was probably exacerbated for the former species by the drought which persists in the Sahel where sorne birds winter. In 1985 the numbers of breeding Grey herons (Table Il) were the highest yet recorded, as were the numbers of wintering Great white herons. During the cold spell, this former rarity to the delta outnumbered the Little egret, and in December 1985 an outstanding total of 42 individuals was recorded (Figure 2). On the other band, the breeding population of Purple herons was the lowest recorded (in 1985) for the previous six years. In spite of the cold spell in January 198 5 and the fact that the species also bred in Spain, the number of Flamingos which nested at the Etang du Fangassier was the second highest on record, with 13, 500 pairs and 7, 800 chicks raised in 1985. An intensive research programme continues on this species based largely on the re-sightings of individually marked birds and a further 1, 333 chicks were « Darvic »-ringed in these two years. Even prior to the cold spell the numbers of waterfowl wintering in the delta, or passing through, were lower than usual, and coupled with the effects of the cold weather, the 1984 - 85 season proved to be the worst in the 21 years since records began. The following winter also revealed low numbers of most species; all except the Gadwall have gradually decreased in numbers since the index years of 1964 - 65 to 1966 - 67. The tendency for birds to concentrate in areas free from hunting is greater now than it was at the end of the 70 's. No similar decrease in numbers at the other maj or wintering areas along the same flyway bas been noted and it would therefore appear that it is the Rhone delta which is no longer as attractive to the ducks as it formerly was. This trend could be reversed by an extension of the feeding areas under protection and a lowering of the shooting pressure throughout the region where the annual bag is still around 150, 000 ducks. The list of raptors observed in the area is still very impressive, but the populations of two of those which breed give cause for alarm. In spite of conservation actions by several organisations and societies the 15 pairs of Bonelli's eagles under observation in Provence raised only 0. 79 and 0. 86 chicks per pair on average in 1984 and 1985 respectively, as opposed to an average of 1. 03 per year since 1974. Also now a rarity is the Lesser kestrel; the only place in France where the species still breeds is the Crau with only 2 and 4 prs. respectively in 1984 and 1985. The tenth complete census since 1956 of the waders, gulls and tems breeding in the brackish and saline lagoons of the greater Camargue area was carried out in 1985. Most species maintained their normal population levels although Avocet numbers were low. Herring gull numbers are kept down by culling whilst the scarcer <b>Slender-billed</b> and Mediterranean <b>gulls</b> both maintained a good foothold in the delta, the latter species showing signs of increasing with a record 23 pairs in 1985.

40|$|Small and {{peripheral}} {{populations are}} typically vulnerable to local extinction processes but {{important for the}} metapopulation dynamics of species. The <b>Slender-billed</b> <b>gull</b> (Chroicocephalus genei) is a long-lived species breeding in unstable ephemeral coastal habitats. Their Western Mediterranean populations are relatively small and represent {{the edge of their}} global geographical distribution. At a local scale, using long-term data (14 years) on annual breeding success and capture-resights of marked individuals, we estimated and compared the vital rates and evaluated the connectivity of two Spanish populations (Ebro Delta and Doñana) varying in their local environmental conditions. At a metapopulation scale, we analyzed 22 years of data on breeding numbers to predict their future prospects by means of population demographic models. Local survival and breeding success of gulls from the Ebro Delta was lower than those from Doñana, which is likely the result of higher permanent emigration and/or winter mortality in the former. Gulls from the Ebro Delta wintered mostly in Mediterranean areas whereas those from Doñana did so in Atlantic coasts, where food availability is higher. Whereas adult local survival was constant, juvenile local survival showed temporal parallel variations between colonies, probably related to natal dispersal to other breeding colonies. Our results suggested that dispersal was higher at the Ebro Delta and gulls emigrating from their natal colonies settled preferentially in close patches. We found large fluctuations in breeding number...|$|E
40|$|The <b>slender-billed</b> <b>gull</b> Chroicocephalus genei is {{a typical}} saltpan and {{brackish}} lagoon inshore forager. In 2005, there were two breeding colonies in the Ebro Delta (western Mediterranean) : one south of the delta on a large saltpan, {{and the other one}} in the north, where typical foraging habitats are scarce. Aerial surveys showed that gulls foraged at sea throughout the study period, but were mainly restricted to {{the northern part of the}} delta from June to August. We compared 6 different approaches to model the gulls" distribution at sea: Poisson generalized linear model (GLM), zero inflated Poisson GLM, spatial Poisson generalized linear mixed model (GLMM), non-spatial Poisson GLMM, negative binomial GLM and zero inflated negative bi -nomial GLM. The best approach, simple negative binomial GLM, suggested that the gulls" distribution was mainly influenced by the proximity to the colony, tern density and water temperature. The water temperature was indicative of river runoff, which resulted in an anchovy population explosion, explaining the gulls" extensive foraging at sea in summer. Slender-billed gulls are capable of changing their foraging strategy to exploit resources at sea when occupying an area with limited terrestrial but abundant marine resources. Population growth in the western Mediterranean may lead to the occupancy of non-typical habitats elsewhere. Because slender-billed gulls are rare and have an unfavorable conservation status, conservation policies affecting this species should be extended to the sea...|$|E
40|$|Current {{rates of}} {{wildlife}} habitat loss have placed increasing demands on managers to develop, validate and implement tools {{aimed at improving}} our ability to evaluate such impacts on wildlife. Here, we present a case study conducted at the Natural Area of Doñana (SW Spain) where remote sensing and stable isotope (d 13 C, d 15 N) analyses of individuals were combined to unravel (1) the effect of variations in availability of natural food resources (i. e. from natural marshes) on reproductive performance of a <b>Slender-billed</b> <b>Gull</b> (Chroicocephalus genei) population, and (2) the role of two adjacent, artificial systems (a fish farm and saltmines) as alternate anthropogenic feeding areas. Based on long-term (1983 – 2004) remote-sensing, we inferred the average extent of flooded area at the marshland (a proxy to natural resource availability) annually. Estimated flooded areas (ranging from extreme drought [ca. 151 ha, 1995] to high moisture [15, 049 ha, 2004]) were positively related to reproductive success of gulls (estimated for the 1993 – 2004 period, and ranging from ca. 0 to 1. 7 fledglings per breeding pairs), suggesting that habitat availability {{played a role in}} determining their reproductive performance. Based on blood d 13 C and d 15 N values of fledglings, 2001 – 2004, and a Bayesian isotopic mixing model, we conclude that saltmines acted as the main alternative foraging habitat for gulls, with relative contributions increasing as the extent of marshland decreased. Although adjacent, anthropogenic systems have been established as the preferred breeding sites for this gull population, dietary switches towards exploitation of alternative (anthropogenic) food resources negatively affected the reproductiv...|$|E
40|$|Repeated {{association}} between subsets of individuals {{is a common}} feature of species living in social groups. Because colonial breeding, an extreme case of group living, is associated with certain group behaviour, colonial species are interesting study models to explore the occurrence of social bonds between individuals. As colonial species are usually highly philopatric, disentangling the fidelity to a breeding site from the fidelity {{to a group of}} individuals is challenging. <b>Slender-billed</b> <b>gull,</b> Chroicocephalus genei, colonies, however, relocate almost yearly. This behaviour makes it possible to study individual associations over several years, i. e. associations between individuals breeding in the same colony in more than 1 year. To quantify and identify the mechanisms that favour repeated individual associations across years, we analysed data from 14 years of observations of 953 individually marked gulls. Our results showed that some individuals repeatedly bred together across breeding seasons despite the colony moving every year. The probability of an individual selecting a colony increased with {{an increase in the number}} of birds that had bred in the same colony as that individual the previous year and not the overall number at the colony. However, we found yearly variation in group tenacity levels and that colony breeding failure favoured splitting of the groups. We also found that association rates rapidly decreased across years but stayed higher than random associations during 2 consecutive years after the first observations. Moreover, over the entire study period, we plotted a bipartite network and found that all colonies and individuals in the population were fully connected. This study reveals group tenacity across years in a colonial bird. Evolutionary pressures as well as the mechanisms favouring social bond persistence across years in colonial birds, however, need further research...|$|E
40|$|This bird {{report for}} the Camargue, Crau and Alpilles (Rhône delta, S. France), covers the years 1980 and 1981. It has been {{compiled}} partly from observations communicated by visiting n aturalists but particularly from resident ornithologists, attached to the « Fondation Tour du Valat », the « Centre d'Écologie de Camargue » (C. N. R. S.), the « Réserve Nationale de Camargue » (S. N. P. N.) and the « Centre de Recherches Ornithologiques de Provence » (C. R. O. P.). As with the previous reports only the results of censuses and unusual observations are given. As a baseline, readers are advised to consult the recently published guide to the birds of the Camargue by Blondel and Isenmann (1981) in which are mentioned all 337 species recorded {{in the area to}} date. The climatological report shows a cold spell in December 1980, with subzero temperatures recorded on 18 days. Total rainfall in autumn and winter was below, but in spring and summer higher, than normal. 1981 was even more unusual, with 25 nights of frost in January, low rainfall, long hours of sunlight and much northerly wind. In contrast, the winter ended (March) mild and wet. April was mild and dry, May cold and wet. The variable summer and autumn weather was characterised by a dry spell (excepting September) with no rain in October/November. December was mild and wet. A first complete census of wintering cormorants revealed 4000 in 1980 and 6000 in 1981 against a formerly estimated maximum of about 2000. This increase has meant that the delta {{has become one of the}} most important wintering are as for the species in western Europe. The Grey Heron population continues to increase with 438 nests in 1980 and 515 in 1981 (table I). In contrast, Purple Herons have decreased in number in the delta over the last decade, probably as a result of a reduction in the available breeding habitat. Large colonies still exist just outside the delta, and the region continues to be the most important breeding area for Purple Herons in France. The population of Cattle Egrets, after being stable from 1977 to 1979 (table II), increased by 48 % in 1980 before decreasing in 1981. This drop was undoubtedly attributable to the cold winter. A nest of Little Bittern was found in 1981 and there is a summer record of a Reef Heron in 1980. A pair of White Storks again bred, raising 3 young in both years. The adult pair are sedentary whilst the young migrate in autumn. Flamingos again bred in large numbers, with 7500 prs. in 1980 and 9500 prs. in 1981, although this latter figure was reduced to 8170 prs. by heavy rains. These raised 3730 and 4000 chicks respectively. The colour-ringing programme continued and a further 1358 chicks were marked during the two years, bringing the total of individu ally recognisable birds to 3316. Of these, 1724 (52 %) have since been identified throughout the West Mediterranean, whilst the total number of sightings exceeds 11000. Both Greylag Goose and Gannet have been attracted to the Flamingo colony, the latter bird staying for three months, displaying and occupying a nest cone and accompanying the flamingos up to 14 kms inland. Bewick's Swans continue to be winter visitors with 52 in 1979 - 1980 and 82 in 1980 - 1981, with a record high of 23 juveniles. The breeding population of Shelduck, a species extending its range in the south of France, was censused in 1980, with 350 chicks (42 families) in the Salins-de-Giraud and 700 (86 families) in the Salins-d'Aigues-Mortes. A further 111 were colour-ringed as part of a study on the movements of the West Mediterranean population which has now been shown to moult in the same area as the North West European population, in North West Germany, a distance of 1200 kms north of the Camargue. Winter counts have revealed peaks of 1354 birds in 1980 and 1035 in 1981, in each case representing over 80 % of the total number recorded in the south of France. For other species of ducks the peak 1980 - 1981 winter count was of 143000 in November. Instead of increasing in December, as is usually the case, the cold spell of early December resulted in a decrease of 25 % mostly caused by a high hunting mortality within the delta. Amongst the major changes in numbers compared to former winters has been a decrease of Pintail and Tufted Ducks and an increase of Shoveler and Gadwall. Diving ducks (Tufted and Pochard) are gradually decreasing in the Camargue because there are more attractive areas further north, whilst some of the surface-feeders tend to increase, Mallard and Teal together regularly forming 50 - 60 % of the total Anatidae. Amongst the seaducks, a concentration of 1000 Scoters, mostly or solely Velvets, was quite exceptional. The area is one of the most remarkable in Europe for raptors at all seasons. Booted Eagles were again regularly recorded in 1980 and a Sea Eagle appeared in both years. Wintering Marsh Harriers are at a remarkably high density with 280 counted at 3 roosts, probably only about half of the total in the area. There were two observations of Eleonora's Falcon in 1981. The average number of wintering coots bas recently decreased from about 25000 (1964 - 1968) to 20000 in 1980 - 1981. Sample censuses of the breeding population indicate a relatively law density of 3. 7 nests per 10 ha. ln the Crau, the wintering Little Bustards have been estimated at 1000 - 1100, which corresponds with the breeding population of about 500 prs. The third record of a Pectoral Sandpiper was a bird shot in September 1979. There is a second winter record of a Great Skua in 1981 and a remarkable observation of 22 Long-tailed Skuas together in the Gulf of Beauduc in May 1980. A pair of Mediterranean Gulls successfully bred in both 1980 and 1981 whilst the <b>Slender-billed</b> <b>Gull</b> was not found breeding either year. The former of these two species occurs in large numbers outside the breeding season with maximum counts of 250 in March 1980 and 700 in September 1981. Two pairs of Black Terns nested in 1980, the first breeding record since 1931. Whiskered Terns bred in 1981 (120 prs.). This species was formerly abundant in the area but bad not been recorded breeding since 1974. The Long-eared Owl, which forms winter roosts of up to 20 birds, was found breeding in 1980 for only the fifth time. There are several spring records of Red-rumped Swallows whilst those of the common Swallow in December may indicate a possible attempt at wintering. Richard's Pipit was recorded for the first time in October 1981 with a second record one month later, whilst the May 1980 record of a Red-throated Pipit was only the sixth in the past 30 years. The Stonechat seems now to be well re-established as a breeding species and there is a possible return of the Penduline Tit with one nest found in each of the two years...|$|E
