5|$|Chased by the shadow, Ged flees to Osskil, seeking {{advice from}} the <b>stone</b> <b>of</b> the Terrenon. He is {{attacked}} on the way by the shadow, which destroys his staff, but Ged escapes into the Court of Terrenon. Serret, {{the lady of the}} castle, shows him the <b>stone</b> <b>of</b> Terrenon, and tempts Ged to speak to it, claiming it can give him limitless knowledge and power. Believing the stone harbors an evil spirit, Ged refuses. Realizing that the servants of the stone wish to enslave him, he flees. He is pursued by the stone's minions but transforms into a falcon and flies away.|$|E
5|$|Northampton's is a {{comparatively}} elaborate war memorial, {{especially for a}} town rather than a city. It consists of a <b>Stone</b> <b>of</b> Remembrance flanked by tall twin obelisks, each adorned {{with a pair of}} painted stone flags. Its use of obelisks, a <b>Stone</b> <b>of</b> Remembrance, and painted flags—all features characteristic of Lutyens' war memorials—make it particularly significant among his works.|$|E
5000|$|His two-volume {{study of}} the Aran Islands, <b>Stones</b> <b>of</b> Aran, is a much-praised {{compendium}} of topographical and culture lore, described by Michael Viney as [...] "One of the most original, revelatory and exhilarating works of literature ever produced in Ireland." [...] <b>Stones</b> <b>of</b> Aran: Pilgrimage follows {{the form of a}} coastal exploration, while <b>Stones</b> <b>of</b> Aran: Labyrinth explores the interior.|$|R

5|$|Dodd {{submitted}} a scheme for a bridge at Vauxhall of 13 arches. However, {{soon after the}} 1809 Act was passed, he was dismissed by the Vauxhall Bridge Company and his design was abandoned. John Rennie was commissioned to design and build the new bridge, and a stone bridge of seven arches was approved. On 9 May 1811, Lord Dundas laid the foundation <b>stone</b> <b>of</b> the bridge on the northern bank.|$|E
5|$|Folk metal is {{a fusion}} genre of heavy metal music and {{traditional}} folk music that developed in Europe during the 1990s. It is characterised by {{the widespread use}} of folk instruments and, to a lesser extent, traditional singing styles (for example, Dutch Heidevolk, Danish Sylvatica and Spanish <b>Stone</b> <b>of</b> Erech). It also sometimes features soft instrumentation influenced by folk rock.|$|E

5|$|Following his assassination, many {{associates}} of Elagabalus {{were killed or}} deposed, including his lover Hierocles. His religious edicts were reversed and the <b>stone</b> <b>of</b> Elagabal {{was sent back to}} Emesa. Women were again barred from attending meetings of the Senate. The practice of damnatio memoriae—erasing from the public record a disgraced personage formerly of note—was systematically applied in his case.|$|E
5|$|The Pevsner City Guide to Manchester {{described}} the cenotaph {{as one of}} the few impressive war memorials in Manchester but lamented its original cluttered setting and its proximity to overhead wires. The cenotaph, obelisks, and stone are features typical of Lutyens' war memorial work, although Manchester's is one of only two with flanking obelisks—Northampton's has a similar pair of obelisks flanking a <b>Stone</b> <b>of</b> Remembrance.|$|E
5|$|The cathedral {{has been}} a focus of Mexican {{cultural}} identity, and {{is a testament to}} its colonial history. Researcher Manuel Rivera Cambas reported that the cathedral was built on the site sacred precinct of the Aztecs and with the very stones of their temples so that the Spaniards could lay claim to the land and the people. Hernán Cortés supposedly laid the first <b>stone</b> <b>of</b> the original church personally.|$|E

5|$|The {{high volume}} of {{visitors}} ascending the Borobudur's narrow stairs, {{has caused a}} severe wear out on the <b>stone</b> <b>of</b> the stairs, eroding the stones surface and made them thinner and smoother. Overall, Borobudur has 2,033 surfaces of stone stairs, spread over four cardinal directions; including the west side, the east, south and north. There are around 1,028 surfaces of them, or about 49.15 percent are severely worn out.|$|E
5|$|After the {{construction}} was complete {{there was no}} further room for expansion at Les Corts. Back-to-back La Liga titles in 1948 and 1949 and the signing of László Kubala in June 1950, who would later go on to score 196 goals in 256 matches, drew larger crowds to the games. The club began to make {{plans for a new}} stadium. The building of Camp Nou commenced on 28 March 1954, before a crowd of 60,000 Barça fans. The first <b>stone</b> <b>of</b> the future stadium was laid in place under the auspices of Governor Felipe Acedo Colunga and with the blessing of Archbishop of Barcelona Gregorio Modrego. Construction took three years and ended on 24 September 1957 with a final cost of 288 million pesetas, 336% over budget.|$|E

5|$|Barbara McLaren engaged Lutyens {{to design}} a {{memorial}} for the gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall, which Spalding Urban District Council had purchased in 1897 to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. Lutyens proposed a U-shaped cloister sheltering a <b>Stone</b> <b>of</b> Remembrance {{standing in front of}} a circular lily pool, in the centre of which would be a cross. McLaren hoped to include space for the families of those commemorated to add their own epitaphs but this proved impractical due to the amount of space that would have been required; she insisted that her husband not receive any special commemoration beyond that afforded to the other casualties.|$|E
5|$|Chetro Ketl's {{walls were}} {{constructed}} using three bulk materials: stone, clay-sand, and water. Two types of stone were used: a hard gray-brown tabular sandstone {{that forms the}} bench above Chaco Canyon's cliffs, and a softer, tan, massively bedded sandstone that forms the cliffs themselves. Chacoans preferred the harder, tabular stone as {{it was easier to}} shape, but much of it had to be dug up and levered out of the ground with wooden poles. Because the massive tan <b>stone</b> <b>of</b> the cliff faces was easier to procure, but much more difficult to work, the Chacoans probably used it only after the more easily quarried gray-brown stone beds had been depleted.|$|E
5|$|Durham's {{location}} in the north left it insecure, as Malcolm Canmore, King of Scots, raided and invaded the north of England {{on a number of}} occasions. Malcolm claimed Northumbria, in which Durham was located, as part of his kingdom. St-Calais managed to befriend Malcolm, and secured his support for the patron saint of Durham, Saint Cuthbert. Malcolm and his wife helped lay the foundation <b>stone</b> <b>of</b> the new cathedral dedicated to Cuthbert. Respect for the saint did not mean that Malcolm refrained entirely from raiding the north; he was killed in 1093 while once more raiding Northumbria. Both the English king and St-Calais did all in their power to support Malcolm's sons, who had been educated in England, in their attempts to secure the Scottish throne.|$|E

5|$|In total, 36% of all {{materials}} and labour costs were spent in Wales, with approximately 1,000tonnes (157,500 <b>stone)</b> <b>of</b> Welsh slate used. The environmental {{features of the}} building have allowed energy savings of between 30% and 50% compared to buildings without these features. The features include 27 pipes that were drilled 100m below ground, so that during cold spells, water is pumped through the pipes and heated to 14°C by geothermal energy. The hot water is then pumped {{back up to the}} slate floor to warm the building to a constant temperature. In warm spells, the same system helps to keep the building cool. A biomass boiler was installed to use wood chips from recycled waste wood to heat the building, and rainwater is collected from the roof to flush the toilets in the building.|$|E
5|$|Scottish coronations were {{traditionally}} held at Scone Abbey, {{with the}} king seated on the <b>Stone</b> <b>of</b> Destiny. The original rituals were a fusion of ceremonies used by the kings of Dál Riata, based on the inauguration of Aidan by Columba in 574, and by the Picts from whom the <b>Stone</b> <b>of</b> Destiny came. A crown {{does not seem to}} have been used until the inauguration of AlexanderII in 1214. The ceremony included the laying on of hands by a senior cleric and the recitation of the king's genealogy. AlexanderIII was the last Scottish king to be crowned in this way in 1249, since the Stone was captured by the English forces of Edward I in 1296. It was later incorporated into the English Coronation Chair and its first certain use at an English coronation was that of HenryIV in 1399. Pope JohnXXII in a bull of 1329 granted the kings of Scotland the right to be anointed and crowned. No record exists of the exact form of the medieval rituals, but a later account exists of the coronation of the 17-month-old infant JamesV at Stirling Castle in 1513. The ceremony was held in a church, since demolished, within the castle walls and was conducted by the Bishop of Glasgow, because the Archbishop of StAndrews had been killed at the Battle of Flodden. It is likely that the child would have been knighted before the start of the ceremony. The coronation itself started with a sermon, followed by the anointing and crowning, then the coronation oath, in this case taken for the child by an unknown noble or priest, and finally an oath of fealty and acclamation by the congregation.|$|E
5|$|She {{was devastated}} by her husband's death and retired to Scotland. However, {{after a meeting}} with the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, she broke her {{retirement}} and resumed her public duties. Eventually she became just as busy as queen mother as she had been as queen consort. In July 1953, she undertook her first overseas visit since the funeral when she visited the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland with Princess Margaret. She laid the foundation <b>stone</b> <b>of</b> the University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland – the current University of Zimbabwe.|$|E
