25|$|A {{monument}} to John Fowler's {{invention of the}} <b>steam</b> <b>plough</b> was placed on his father-in-law's Pierremont estate in 1856, but was moved in 1870 to South Park, Darlington. The plinth may still be seen there, but the plough that it supported disappeared in 1970.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the failure}} of his first steam-driven plough, Fowler reverted to the design used for his second horse-driven plough. His new design {{consisted}} of a steam engine placed {{in a corner of}} the field driving a winch. A rope led from the winch along the side of the field, around a securely anchored pulley and across the field to the mole plough. As the winch drew in the rope the mole plough was drawn across the field digging a drainage channel as it went. The engine also had a second winch with a rope passing round the same anchored pulley and then passing across the field and around a second pulley and back to the plough. This second rope would be used to drag the plough back to its starting point after completing a drainage line. Both pulleys would then be re-anchored at both ends of the next channel to be dug and the ploughing process would be repeated. The <b>steam</b> <b>plough</b> was demonstrated at the Royal Agricultural Society of England meeting at Lincoln in 1854.|$|E
25|$|He married Ana Sáenz de Zumarán in 1887, {{and they}} had three children. Following Juárez Celman's {{resignation}} in 1890, Cárcano toured Europe, returning in 1891 to his estancia {{on the banks of}} the Tercero River. There, he introduced Polled Durham cattle, a vaccine against anthrax that had been prepared at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, and an imported <b>steam</b> <b>plough</b> (becoming the first landowner in Argentina to use these innovations). Cárcano wrote numerous historical works during this period, notably El general Quiroga y la expedición al desierto (1882), Perfiles contemporáneos (1885), La universidad de Córdoba (1892), Historia de los medios de comunicación y transporte en la Argentina (1893), Estudios coloniales (1895), and La reforma universitaria (1901), and was inducted into the National Academy of History of Argentina in 1901. Named President of the Agricultural Education Advisory Commission in 1907, he joined the Higher Institute of Agronomy and Veterinary Medicine, becoming the school's first dean upon its 1909 incorporation into the University of Buenos Aires. Among his best-known works outside the subject of history was Evolución histórica del régimen de la tierra pública, a study on eminent domain.|$|E

2500|$|One of his biographers, the {{historian}} William Hepworth Dixon, states: [...] "Bacon's {{influence in the}} modern world is so great that every man who rides in a train, sends a telegram, follows a <b>steam</b> <b>plough,</b> sits in an easy chair, crosses the channel or the Atlantic, eats a good dinner, enjoys a beautiful garden, or undergoes a painless surgical operation, owes him something." ...|$|E
60|$|Well--but it is answered, {{are we to}} have no diamonds, nor china, nor pictures, nor footmen, then--but all to be farmers? I am {{not saying}} {{what we ought to}} do, I want only to show you with perfect {{clearness}} first what we are doing; and that, I repeat, is the upshot of machine-contriving in this country. And observe its effect on the national strength. Without machines, you have a hundred and fifty yeomen ready to join for defence of the land. You get your machine, starve fifty of them, make diamond-cutters or footmen of as many more, and for your national defence against an enemy, you have now, and can have, only fifty men, instead of a hundred and fifty; these also now with minds much alienated from you as their chief,[141] and the rest, lapidaries or footmen; and a <b>steam</b> <b>plough.</b>|$|E
60|$|If {{one looks}} into the {{conditions}} of industrial employment specialisation will be found to linger just in proportion as a trade has remained unaffected by inventions and innovation. The building trade, for example, is a fairly conservative one. A brick wall is made to-day {{much as it was}} made two hundred years ago, and the bricklayer is in consequence a highly skilled and inadaptable specialist. No one who has not passed through a long and tedious training can lay bricks properly. And it needs a specialist to plough a field with horses or to drive a cab through the streets of London. Thatchers, old-fashioned cobblers, and hand workers are all specialised to a degree no new modern calling requires. With machinery skill disappears and unspecialised intelligence comes in. Any generally intelligent man can learn {{in a day or two}} to drive an electric tram, fix up an electric lighting installation, or guide a building machine or a <b>steam</b> <b>plough.</b> He must be, of course, much more generally intelligent than the average bricklayer, but he needs far less specialised skill. To repair machinery requires, of course, a special sort of knowledge, but not a special sort of training.|$|E

50|$|In {{the days}} when <b>steam</b> <b>ploughing</b> was common, the engine would often remain on the {{headland}} and pull the plough across the field by a wire rope. There would be severe compaction of the headland but little compaction {{of the rest of}} the field. There would usually be two engines, one on each headland, and they would winch the plough to and fro between them.|$|R
50|$|In the museum's outdoor spaces, {{there are}} more than 40 {{different}} models of trains.

6000|$|And in {{languages}} so mongrel in breed as the English, {{there is}} a fatal power of equivocation put into men's hands, almost whether they will or no, {{in being able to}} use Greek or Latin words for an idea when they want it to be awful; and Saxon or otherwise common words when they want it to be vulgar. What a singular and salutary effect, for instance, would be produced on the minds of {{people who are in the}} habit of taking the Form of the [...] "Word" [...] they live by, for the Power of which that Word tells them, if we always either retained, or refused, the Greek form [...] "biblos," [...] or [...] "biblion," [...] as the right expression for [...] "book"--instead of employing it only in the one instance in which we wish to give dignity to the idea, and translating it into English everywhere else. How wholesome it would be for many simple persons if, in such places (for instance) as Acts xix. 19, we retained the Greek expression, instead of translating it, and they had to read--"Many of them also which used curious arts, brought their bibles together, and burnt them before all men; and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver"! Or if, on the other hand, we translated where we retain it, and always spoke of [...] "The Holy Book," [...] instead of [...] "Holy Bible," [...] it might come into more heads than it does at present, that the Word of God, by which the heavens were, of old, and by which they are now kept in store, {6} cannot be made a present of to anybody in morocco binding; nor sown on any wayside by help either of <b>steam</b> <b>plough</b> or steam press; but is nevertheless being offered to us daily, and by us with contumely refused; and sown in us daily, and by us, as instantly as may be, choked.|$|E

60|$|It was {{the fourth}} of February in the year 1875. It had been a severe winter, and the snow lay deep in the gorges of the Gilmerton Mountains. The <b>steam</b> <b>ploughs</b> had, however, kept the {{railroad}} open, and the evening train which connects {{the long line of}} coal-mining and iron-working settlements was slowly groaning its way up the steep gradients which lead from Stagville on the plain to Vermissa, the central township which lies at the head of Vermissa Valley. From this point the track sweeps downward to Bartons Crossing, Helmdale, and the purely agricultural county of Merton. It was a single track railroad; but at every siding--and they were numerous--long lines of trucks piled with coal and iron ore told of the hidden wealth which had brought a rude population and a bustling life to this most desolate corner of the United States of America.|$|R
50|$|Charles Burrell started {{building}} ploughing engines from {{as early as}} 1860 in the very infancy of <b>steam</b> <b>ploughing.</b> These engines were built under license from John Fowler & Co who had patented the system of steam cultivation with two engines several years earlier. These early engines were very similar to Kitson and Hewitson design of ploughing engine {{with the exception of}} the drive to the rear wheels which was via chain. In addition Burrell produced, again under licence from Fowlers, a range of implements for cable ploughing including balance ploughs, turn-about cultivators and a patent small cultivator for use on light land with a single engine. Despite these early exploits and the company having extensive interests in producing engines for agricultural purposes Burrell paid scant attention to the construction of ploughing engines. All told the company produced 142 ploughing engines between 1860 and 1914 when the final pair of engines were completed for a customer in Germany. Early engines were often chain driven but later engines were gear driven speciality order engines for overseas customers.|$|R

50|$|The company rapidly {{developed}} {{a range of}} traction engines, <b>steam</b> rollers, <b>ploughing</b> engines, agricultural implements and stationary engines. One of their forgotten achievements is the invention (see British Patent 763 of 1880) of the traction-centre engine, for driving steam-powered fairground roundabouts. This is often wrongly attributed to Savage of King's Lynn. In the 1890s, McLaren {{developed a}} range of vertical triple-expansion engines for the new industry of electricity generation. The zenith of this effort {{was a pair of}} 3000 ihp engines for Leeds Corporation’s Whitehall Road Power Station. After the start of the 20th century, the company introduced a tractor for direct haulage and a range of powerful direct-ploughing engines. The largest of these, rated 125 ihp, was fitted with superheater, feedwater heater and fully lagged cylinders. This provided a very efficient engine, which won many awards both at home and abroad.
