25|$|Player {{was born}} in Johannesburg, South Africa, the {{youngest}} of Harry and Muriel Player's three children. When he {{was eight years old}} his mother died from cancer. Although his father was often away from home working in the gold mines, he did manage to take a loan in order to buy a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>clubs</b> for his son Gary to begin playing golf. The Virginia Park golf course in Johannesburg is where Player first began his love affair with golf. At the age of 14, Player played his first round of golf and parred the first three holes. At age 16, he announced that he would become number one in the world. At age 17, he became a professional golfer.|$|E
2500|$|His unassuming {{nature is}} also {{reflected}} in his reaction to a [...] "Charlie Gehringer Day" [...] held by the Tigers in 1929. [...] Fans from Gehringer's hometown and throughout Detroit filled the stands for a 17–13 win over the Yankees. [...] Gehringer handled 10 chances at second base, had four hits including a home run, and stole home. [...] In a ceremony, the people of Fowlerville presented Gehringer {{with a set of}} golf clubs. [...] Though the clubs were right-handed, and Gehringer was left-handed, Gehringer learned to golf right-handed rather than trade for a left-handed <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>clubs.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{golf swing}} is {{outwardly}} similar {{to many other}} motions involving swinging a tool or playing implement, such as an axe or a baseball bat; however, unlike many of these motions, {{the result of the}} swing is highly dependent on several sub-motions being properly aligned and timed, to ensure that the club travels up to the ball in line with the desired path, the clubface is in line with the swing path, and the ball impacts the centre or [...] "sweet spot" [...] of the clubface. The ability to do this consistently, across a complete <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>clubs</b> {{with a wide range of}} shaft lengths and clubface areas, is a key skill for any golfer, and takes a significant effort to achieve.|$|E

60|$|I {{belong to}} many Clubs. The 'Union Jack,' the 'Sash and Marlin-spike'--Military Clubs. 'The True Blue,' the 'No Surrender,' the 'Blue and Buff,' the 'Guy Fawkes,' and the 'Cato Street'--Political Clubs. 'The Brummel' and the 'Regent'--Dandy Clubs. The 'Acropolis,' the 'Palladium,' the 'Areopagus,' the 'Pnyx' the 'Pentelicus,' the 'Ilissus' and the 'Poluphloisboio Thalasses'--Literary Clubs. I never {{could make out}} how the latter <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>Clubs</b> got their names; I don't know Greek for one, and I wonder how many other members of those {{institutions}} do? Ever since the Club Snobs have been announced, I observe a sensation created on my entrance into {{any one of these}} places. Members get up and hustle together; they nod, they scowl, as they glance towards the present Snob. 'Infernal impudent jackanapes! If he shows me up,' says Colonel Bludyer, 'I'll break every bone in his skin.' 'I told you what would come of admitting literary men into the Club,' says Ranville Ranville to his colleague, Spooney, of the Tape and Sealing-Wax Office. 'These people are very well in their proper places, and as a public man, I make a point of shaking hands with them, and that sort of thing; but to have one's privacy obtruded upon by such people is really too much. Come along, Spooney,' and the pair of prigs retire superciliously.|$|E

50|$|There {{are also}} many hybrid clubs, {{so-called}} because they combine {{some of the}} characteristics of irons and woods, that closely resemble standard irons. Indeed, many <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> especially those marketed for beginners, now include hybrids to replace the more traditional 3 and 4 irons.|$|R
25|$|Low's biggest {{challenge}} as a club maker occurred in March 1909 when Baltusrol's original clubhouse burned down. Low's repair shop was saved, but some 400 <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> members' <b>clubs</b> were destroyed. In those days {{there were no}} standardized <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>clubs,</b> and each golfer's assortment <b>of</b> <b>clubs</b> was highly individualized. Low must have suffered the tortures of the damned as he responded to each replacement order, and he must have earned a pretty penny as he did so. But, as one newspaper observed, Low suffered large losses to his own account in the fire so that what he made in sales was partially offset by his losses in the fire.|$|R

He was known for his shotmaking ability, being able to make the ball curve in the air even on short lofted shots.|$|E
5000|$|The Executive Committee of {{this era}} {{therefore}} governed a loosely unified [...] "two-leagues-in-one" [...] set-up containing alternative attitudes and some differing rules. It was essentially dominated by representatives <b>of</b> the top-flight <b>clubs,</b> {{who had a}} constitutional advantage in numbers and whose views were soon to conflict with the reps from the burgeoning mainstream section who believed in integration and equality. Ongoingly turbulent times became inevitable because both <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>clubs</b> were looking in different cricketing directions.|$|R

50|$|Early {{golf clubs}} were all made of wood. They were hand-crafted, often by the players themselves, {{and had no}} {{standard}} shape or form.

Later, as more malleable iron became widely used for shorter-range clubs, an even wider variety of clubs became available.|$|E
