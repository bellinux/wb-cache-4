5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are capable}} of killing humans. Mistaken identity leading to an attack is always possible, especially in or near cloudy waters. American alligators are often less aggressive towards humans than larger crocodile species, a few of which (mainly the Nile and Saltwater crocodiles) may prey on humans with some regularity. American alligator bites are <b>serious</b> <b>injuries</b> due to the reptile's sheer bite force and risk of infection. Even with medical treatment, an American alligator bite may still result in a fatal infection.|$|E
5|$|Concussions are {{particularly}} concerning, as repeated concussions may increase a person's risk {{in later life}} for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and mental health issues such as dementia, Parkinson's disease, and depression. Concussions are often caused by helmet-to-helmet collisions, impact against the ground or other players' knees, and upper-body contact between opposing players. However, helmets have prevented more <b>serious</b> <b>injuries</b> such as skull fractures. Cervical spine injuries can be catastrophic, but have sharply declined since the mid-1970s due to rule changes and improved workout regimes, equipment, and coaching.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Mental {{health and}} injury are {{neglected}} public health issues especially in low-income nations. The {{objective of the}} study was to determine the prevalence and socio-demographic correlates for <b>serious</b> <b>injury</b> in the last 12 months. Findings The study used data of the 2007 Djibouti Global School-based Health Survey. Logistic regression analysis was used to establish associations. Of the 1, 777 respondents, 61. 1 % (63. 2 % males and 57. 8 % females) reported having sustained <b>serious</b> <b>injury</b> (SSI). Compared to participants who were not bullied, those who reported being bullied 3 - 9 days per month were more likely to have sustained <b>serious</b> <b>injury</b> in the last 12 months (AOR = 1. 27; 95 % CI [1. 06, 1. 52] for 3 - 5 days of bullying victimization per month, and AOR = 3. 19; 95 % CI [2. 28, 4. 47] for 6 - 9 days per month. Adolescents who were engaged in physical fighting were 47 % (AOR = 1. 47, 95 % CI [1. 40, 1. 55] more likely to have sustained <b>serious</b> <b>injury</b> compared to those who were not engaged in the fighting. Meanwhile, adolescents who used substances (cigarettes, other forms of tobacco or drugs) were 30 % (AOR = 1. 30, 95 % CI [1. 19, 1. 42]) more likely to have sustained <b>serious</b> <b>injury</b> compared to those who did not use substances. Conclusions <b>Serious</b> <b>injury</b> is common among adolescents in Djibouti, and we suggest that health workers attending to injured adolescents explore the patients' psycho-social environment. Further, we suggest longitudinal studies where reduction of substance use and bullying may be assessed if they have an impact in reducing <b>serious</b> <b>injury</b> among adolescents. </p...|$|R
