40|$|This study {{developed}} {{new concepts}} and interpretative methods for mapping reservoir heterogeneity and connectivity of a fault controlled Wilcox clastic reservoir in Texas, USA. The application of high-resolution seismic enhancement {{in this study}} allows for better delineation of subsurface geologic features, detailed mapping of reservoir heterogeneities and more accurate identification of depositional, structural, and stratigraphic characteristics that control reservoir connectivity and fluid flow. Seismic enhancement in this study pertains to amplitude preserving neural network implementation of the Volterra integral equation of the first kind from a plane-wave solution of poro-viscoelasticity (Sun, et al., 2003). This enhancement amounts to an advanced spiked deconvolution of post-stack seismic data that broadened the dominant seismic frequency from 16 Hz for the conventional seismic to 65 Hz for the enhanced seismic. Bed resolution is improved from 175 ft to 45 ft and fault offset resolution is improved from 80 ft to 20 ft. High-resolution seismic interpretation was validated through synthetic seismograms, stratigraphic surface comparisons, and most importantly using a comprehensive model-based knowledge of regional tectonics and depositional environments. Stratigraphic features that were not resolvable in conventional seismic data can now be interpreted using the enhanced seismic data. An Upper Wilcox reservoir {{was identified as a}} transgressive <b>sheet</b> <b>sand</b> overlaying a progradational deltaic seismic facies. An Upper Middle Wilcox reservoir was identified as a probable lobate gravity flow, and a Middle Wilcox reservoir was identified as a transgressive <b>sheet</b> <b>sand</b> with over and underlying progradational deltaic seismic facies. Geobody extraction from seismic inversion volumes delineates reservoir compartments and flow units. Reservoir connectivity analysis performed on the Middle Wilcox reservoir determined the probable drainage area for a producing well by comparing estimates of compartmentalized hydrocarbon volumes with production information. The methodology developed could help extract connected geobodies defined by sand, porosity, permeability, and hydrocarbon indicators, to map in detail the internal structure of produced reservoir and to locate new development prospects. Enhanced seismic may thus enable us to find bypassed hydrocarbons and to provide better methods for improving recovery in the studied and other mature fields...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Data on the {{development}} of oscillatory ripple marks under waves are utilized as a further check on the equations that have been proposed for the threshold of sediment motion. If the threshold curve is correct, the data on ripple occurrence should lie in a stress field above the curve for threshold. Analysis of the data shows this mainly to be true but suggests that the curve for the threshold should be lowered slightly to smaller stress values as a number of ripple occurrences would otherwise fall below the threshold curve. As the stress of the wave orbital motion increases, the ripple heights progressively decrease and ultimately disappear at a critical stress value. Data on this disappearance and plane-bed <b>sheet</b> <b>sand</b> transport development are examined and compared with the data on the high-stress presence of ripples. There is good agreement of the two data sets and also confirmation of the theoretical criterion of Bagnold for the disappearance of ripples...|$|E

40|$|According to the {{characteristics}} of sedimentary microfacies, unique vertical depositional sequences and well logging response, the authors propose that a shallow water delta was widely developed in the Neogene of the Laibei area, Bohai Bay Basin of northern China. Based on seismic minimum amplitude slices, well logging data, test analytical data and so forth, detailed research {{on the evolution of}} the shallow water delta of the Neogene Lower Member of Minghuazhen Formation was conducted. The results indicate that the third-order sequence base level controls sandbody types. During a period of low base level, a distributary channel sandbody of shallow water deltaic plain was developed. With base level rising, the sandbody type gradually changed into a subaqueous distributary channel sandbody and a <b>sheet</b> <b>sand</b> can be found as well. The fourth-order sequence base level controls medium–short term evolution of the sandbody.

40|$|The Scarborough Formation is the {{youngest}} marine horizon of formation status within the dominantly deltaic Aalenian - Bajocian Ravenscar Group, Cleveland Basin, northeast England. Sedimentary facies analysis has been performed on the three conformable lithostratigraphic units which make {{up the bulk of}} the Scarborough Formation outcrop: Blea Wyke, Byland Limestone and Crinoid Grit Members. This form of analysis was performed in an effort to determine the depositional environments of the members. The information derived from the study enables one to trace the palaeogeographic evolution of the Cleveland Basin throughout much of Scarborough Formation times. The clastic Blea Wyke Member [6 facies] is attributed to deposition in a shallow [< 4 m], essentially microtidal,delta-destructive marine embayment. This embayment formed through non-eustatic marine transgression initiated by the compactional subsidence of an abandoned [Gristhorpe Member] delta lobe. Open to the east, the embayment covered some 2000 km 2 of the Cleveland Basin when fully established. A range of sand bodies evolved on the silty embayment floor in response to spatial and temporal changes in the wind-forced wave and current regime. These sand bodies included subtidal shoals, laterally extensive storm-emplaced sand blankets, and a classic delta-destructive <b>sheet</b> <b>sand</b> formed through the landward translation of a low-profile barrier bar. Under sustained rate-of-subsidence controlled marine transgression, clastic input to the Blea Wyke Member embayment eventually waned. In response, the overlying Byland Limestone Member [6 facies] was deposited {{in the western part of}} the Cleveland Basin in the form of a carbonate-dominated lagoon-barrier-inner shelf  complex. The barrier component of the complex evolved through transgressive upward-shoaling under the influence of wind-forced wave and current activity. Composed of pellet lime grainstones, it protected a lagoon within which the dominant deposits were pellet lime mudstones, wackestones and packstones. Lithological and faunal similarities between the lagoon and inner shelf suggest that much of the shelf region may have comprised former back-barrier lagoon-fills exhumed during transgression. Byland Limestone Member times were terminated by an acceleration in the rate of marine transgression followed by tectonic uplift and subsequent geomorphic decay of the major landmass to the north [Mid North Sea High]. Transgression generated an east-west orientated epeiric seaway connecting the Sole Pit Trough with an areally restricted Pennine Massif. Within this seaway, clastic sediment derived chiefly from the Mid North Sea High was deposited in the form of a progradational, regional-scale composite <b>sheet</b> <b>sand</b> body: the Crinoid Grit Member [8 facies]. Deposition occurred under the combined influence of tidal currents, wind-forced currents and wave activity. Three main facies belts are recognised: paralic tidal sandwave complex, storm-dominated inner shelf and sandy middle shelf. The presence of a tidal sandwave complex is particularly interesting; it indicates that the forging of a marine connection to the west of the Cleveland Basin was necessary before tidal cyclicity could become prominent within the basin...|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} study was to characterize the stratigraphy and petroleum geology as well as establishing the depositional setting. Stratigraphically, with the underlying Lillydale Shale (Pencil Cave), it occupies a position between the Greenbrier Limestone (Big Lime) below and the Reynolds Limestone Member of the Bluefield Formation (Little Lime) above. In the study area it was deposited as a <b>sheet</b> <b>sand</b> from anastamosing fluvial channels flowing into the Bluefield Sea with a delta/barrier system to the south. This was deposited during the regressive sequence between the transgressive Pencil Cave and Little Lime.   The Blue Monday sandstone has been a prolific producer in the past and remains a secondary target for exploration. Production data for wells completed only in the Blue Monday are sparse as Blue Monday sandstone production is typically commingled with production from other zones. Well log porosity in the Blue Monday sandstone ranges from one to twenty percent. Well logs exemplify the fact that the sand has lenses of more and less porous material, indicating flow unit differentiation. Production might be enhanced by hydraulic or chemical fracturing. The highest well log porosities were not always found in the channels which may be due to diagenetic factors such as cementation or the presence of shale interbeds.   M. S...|$|E

The second <b>sand</b> <b>sheet</b> (Pleurothyrella Lithofacies) is heavily burrowed and shows alternating periods of sedimentation, burrowing, and erosion below wave base as the sea deepened (Catenarichnus Ichnocoenosis). With increasing transgression, finer sediments were deposited (Laminated Mudstone and Feldspathic lithofacies) in an unstable pattern of coarse sandbars and finer troughs (Cruziana-Rusophycus and Arenicolites ichnocoenoses) crossed by active longshore marine channels (Poorly-sorted Lithofacies, Spirophyton Ichnoocoenosis). Short-lived but powerful storms produced thin shelly tempestites (Shell-bed Lithofacies), whereas sporadic, very thin phosphate rich beds (Phosphatic Lithofacies) may have resulted from marine transgressions across the basin. The deepest water is probably represented by sediments of the Spirifer Lithofacies (Rosselia Ichnocoenosis). The Schulthess Lithofacies is regarded as fluvial, deposited in the lower reaches of a river draining a land area that lay towards Marie Byrd Land.

Four seismic sequences are d fined and are coeval {{with a series of}} deltaic deposits in the northern and central parts of the basin. In the southwestern area these are interpreted as stacked submarine fan deposits. In the southeastern area the lower two sequences are interpreted as shelf-slope deposits which are overlain by two submarine fan complexes. Funnelling of the sediment was controlled by erosive channelling through interfan topographic lows. The seismic response indicates hat the fans are dominated by lower fan <b>sheet</b> <b>sand</b> deposits with minor amounts of upper fan channellized sandstones.

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 Sediments on {{the inner}} portion of the Oregon {{continental}} shelf consist of clean, well-sorted, detrital sand. This sand has an average median diameter of 2. 53 Φ (. 173 mm) and is both positively and negatively skewed. Deposits with median diameters in the coarse sand and gravel classes occur at depths of 20 to 40 fathoms and probably represent ancient beach or fluviatile deposits formed during lower stands of sea level. The outer shelf and upper slope are covered by poorly sorted sediments with median diameters in the fine sand to fine silt classes. Mean diameters of the sediments are almost always smaller than their median diameters and the sediments are positively skewed. The heavy mineral assemblages are dominated by the amphibole and pyroxene groups and the opaque-garnet association. Pyroxenes are most abundant in the coarser-grained sediments of the inner shelf and decrease in abundance offshore. Amphiboles are most abundant in the finer-grained sediments of the outer shelf and upper slope. Highest concentrations of the opaque-garnet association also {{are found in the}} inshore samples. Sediments of the continental shelf are derived from two principal sources, rivers and erosion of coastal terrace deposits. Rivers are probably contributing only fine-grained material to the shelf as much of the coarser fluviatile material is thought to be trapped in the estuaries. The terrace deposits are actively being eroded and are thought to contribute about 21, 000, 000 cubic feet (. 00013 cubic miles) of sediment to the continental shelf annually.

Acquisition of two cores (# 1 Ketler and # 1 Young) during the Mobil-Mississippi Project of 1993 has provided {{the opportunity for a}} detailed petrologic and depositional analysis. The Cocoa Sand Member is a moderate to well sorted, poorly cemented quartz arenite with an average composition of Q% Fo L 4. Lithic fragments are dominated by sedimentary rock fragments that appear to be rip-up clasts from the underlying North Twistwood Creek Clay. Quartz grains range from well rounded to angular with embayed anhedral to euhedral grains common. They are often encased in tangential clays indicating a possible reworked sedimentary to volcanic source for this sandstone. Heavy mineral analysis supports a volcanic source, but also indicates a metamorphic contribution. The Cocoa Sand shows little compaction with a packing density averaging 43 % and the packing proximity averaging 21 %. Point and tangential contacts are predominant as point count porosity averages 18. 4 %. The dominant authigenic phase is Camontmorillonite with lesser amounts of kaolinite, illite, calcite, and heulandite. Core, petrographic, and log analyses indicates that the Cocoa Sand Member of the Yazoo Formation is an isolated, intrabasinal <b>sheet</b> <b>sand</b> that thickens in the down dip direction. Winnowing of the North Twistwood Creek Member of the Yazoo Formation during transgression resulted in the deposition of the Cocoa Sandstone. This is supported by the similarities in composition between the North Twistwood Creek Member and the Cocoa Sand Member and the presence of rip-up clasts found at the North Twistwood Creek-Cocoa Sand Member contact.

40|$|ABSTRACTSome present-day eolian <b>sand</b> <b>sheets</b> {{have small}} and width dunes, called zibars, as {{common type of}} depositional morphology. Their {{formation}} is related to different stabilizing factors, which reduce the availability of clastic materials for eolian processes. In fact, zibars are dunes which do {{not have time to}} develop a larger dune with slipface (proto-dune). Dunes in <b>sands</b> <b>sheet</b> areas generally are constructed by wind ripple laminations and commonly generate sedimentary succession less than 20 m thick, which are the consequence of low sand supply.

This paper tries to explain the anomalous thick of this <b>sand</b> <b>sheet</b> sedimentary succession. High thickness was probably the result of a high input of sand material, combine with low availability of sand, thus allowing the only construction of proto-dunes (zibars). Early cementation, due to near-surface evaporation of saline water, has been proposed as main factor that reduced the sand availability into this eolian system.

40|$|ABSTRACTThe intermontane Upper Tulum eolian <b>sand</b> <b>sheet</b> covers {{an area of}} ca. 125 km² {{at north}} of the San Juan Province, central-western Argentina. The <b>sand</b> <b>sheet</b> is {{currently}} an aggrading system where vegetation cover, surface cementation and periodic flooding withhold the development of dunes with slipfaces. The <b>sand</b> <b>sheet</b> surface {{is divided into three}} parts according to the distribution of sedimentary features, which reflects the variation in sediment budget, water table level and periodic flooding. The central <b>sand</b> <b>sheet</b> part is the main area of eolian deposition and is largely stabilized by vegetation.

40|$|This review {{presents}} {{a summary of}} the published data and their interpretations derived from the continental shelf seabed in the mature oil and gas areas of the West Shetland Shelf occurring to the north and west of the British Isles. The basis for this review is the premise that variations in the seabed geology will influence variations in the modern seabed habitat. The purpose is to review the seabed geomorphology, near-bottom currents, types of rock outcrop, variations in unconsolidated sediment texture, the variety and distributions of seabed bedforms and selected aspects of sediment inorganic geochemistry. It is intended that the review will provide a basis for a better understanding of conditions in the modern seabed environment and for possible future scenarios of strategic environmental interest. The large-scale physiography of the inner-to-middle continental shelf has originated from varying degrees of rock and unconsolidated sediment resistance to the effects of erosion by icesheets during several glaciations since approximately 1. 1 Ma. Although ice-sheet erosion has also locally dissected the outer continental shelf, other variations in shelf physiography are identified with bedforms that were generated when sediments were deposited as the former ice sheets advanced and retreated across the continental shelf. There is little modern sediment input to the continental shelf. Thus the modern seabed environment now largely reflects the effects of reworking by near-bottom currents on the topography and the sediments that originated during the glaciations. The reworked sediments typically consist of large areas of relict seabed gravel on elevated topography, mobile <b>sheet</b> <b>sand</b> deposits on relatively flat seafloor and muddy sands and sandy muds in the sheltered coastal and nearshore areas and in basins on the open continental shelf. Rock crops at seabed and just below seabed in the areas of the inner and middle continental shelf that had previously undergone the strongest sub-ice erosion.

40|$|The Waltersburg {{sandstone}} produces {{oil from}} isolated sand bodies and has produced nearly eight {{million barrels of}} oil from those of the Rochester, Mounts, and Fleener Fields. From the overlying "little Menard" Limestone to the Vienna Limestone below, the Waltersburg interval is most commonly 70 feet thick, but ranges from 14 feet in the north to 116 feet in the south. Increasing interval thickness is strongly correlated with increasing sand percentage. The maximum sand accumulation occurs in elongate sand bodies up to 100 feet thick,one-fourth to one mile wide, and two to five miles long. Elongate sand bodies are commonly oriented northeast-southwest, nearly perpendicular to strike. <b>Sheet</b> <b>sand</b> bodies are less than half as thick and usually produce only from small structural highs. Structure contour maps of the Vienna and "little Msnard" Limestones show that a 16 square mile plunging anticline bearing N 30 E exists along with other minor folds on a regional slope dipping about 40 feet per mile into the Illinois Basin. The structure of the "little Menard" may be associated with structural features of the Vienna, with isolated thick sand bodies or both where they occur together. Structural features of the "little Menard" that are not seen on the Vienna are usually attributed to differential compaction over sand bodies. The overall similarity in folding of both limestones suggests that deformation occurred after Waltersburg deposition as a result of differential compaction over older sediments combined with regional tilting as sediments subsided into the Illinois Basin. Oil production occurs in sands 10 to 60 feet thick that are structurally high. Structural elevation is therefore more important to production than sand thickness. Since most structural traps have been exploited, the most favorable locations for potential production are where thick elongate sands thin up-dip to form stratigraphic traps. Although a few locations for possible stratigraphic traps exist within the study area, extending exploration in recommended places may lead to more promising production outside the study area. On the basis of petrography, subsurface geometry, and log signatures of the Waltersburg sandstone, the depositional environment is suggested as being a fluvial dominated delta plain facies. The various types of thick elongate sand bodies are attributed to fluvial distributary channels. The interdistributary area is represented by mostly shale and silt, with crevasse-splay sands and possible minor mouth bar/crevasse-splay couplets. Part of illustrative matter in pocket. Thesis (M.

The St. Peter sandstone is an arenaceous, ortho-quartzitic, sublittoral cratonic <b>sheet</b> <b>sand</b> of middle Ordovician age. It is remarkable in geographic extent, mineralogical composition, thickness and engineering properties. A {{vast majority of}} its extent is buried; only in the Upper Mississippi River valley is it readily exposed. The St. Peter sandstone behaves as a locked sand, a nearly cohesionless geo-material characterized by brittle behavior, a lack of interstitial cement, and high dilation rates at failure. When confined {{it is capable of}} supporting large loads with small deformations, even under saturated conditions, yet when confinement is removed it disintegrates and readily flows. Dry intact samples have a uniaxial strength of approximately 1 MPa and a Young’s Modulus of about 1 GPa. Triaxial tests conducted at confining pressures of less than 150 kPa yield an angle of internal friction of approximately 60 Because the St. Peter sandstone disintegrates so readily when unconfined, sampling the material is quite difficult. The St. Peter sandstone has been excavated as foundation material, and for tunnels and sewers, by the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul for decades. Earliest testing was for those endeavors. As the interest in the design of underground spaces has grown, testing of the St. Peter sandstone has changed to meet that need but testing has been done predominantly in the laboratory. The purpose of this project was to evaluate the mechanical properties of St. Peter sandstone by comparing in situ tests with laboratory test results. Direct shear tests were conducted to evaluate strength-dilatancy behavior. Transmitted light and scanning electron microscopy were used to help explain the high friction angle of the material. At low confining pressures the St. Peter sandstone exhibits a friction angle of around 60 but with small cohesion, less than 100 kPa. The high angle of internal friction at failure may be due to locked sand particles or to post-depositional quartz overgrowths. Tests on pulverized, densely packed samples (with void ratios similar to intact samples) and loosely packed samples were conducted in the same fashion as the intact samples and yielded friction angles of approximately 45 and 35 respectively. Pressuremeter tests were performed in situ and the results were interpreted using elasto-plastic analysis. By properly considering system stiffness, a Young’s modulus of approximately 0. 5 GPa was determined and a friction angle between 60 and 40 was estimated, depending on the assumed dilation angle...|$|E

Subsequent workers in ichnology have generally accepted this interpretation and have utilized Astropolithon as a distinctive Cambrian ichnofossfl and furthermore have even erected new ichnospecies. It is proposed here that A. hindii is a physical rather than biogenic sedimentary structure, merely representing one variation in a morphologically variable assemblage of sand volcanoes produced {{as a result of}} fluidization along discrete flow paths of rapidly deposited turbiditic or fluidized <b>sheet</b> <b>sands.</b> As such, A. hindii should be regarded as a pseudofossil and other biogenic structures assigned to it should necessarily be incorporatred into a new ichnogenus...|$|R

40|$|The work {{presented}} {{here is a}} study to examine the improvement in bearing capacity of coastal sand of Trivandrum, Kerala, India using high density polyethylene (HDPE) /woven fabric as reinforcement in discrete layers. The bearing capacity was evaluated using plate load test. The effect of reinforcement configurations like <b>sheet</b> reinforcement (<b>sanded</b> with adhesive, with adhesive and sheet alone) and strip reinforcement (single and grid pattern) are investigated. The test parameters chosen {{for the present study}} are, depth of topmost layer of reinforcement layer below footing, compacted density and number of layers of reinforcement etc. From the tests, it has been observed that sheet reinforcement is more effective than <b>sheet</b> <b>sanded</b> with adhesive and strip reinforcements. It is found that the synthetic adhesive gives no binding action at the interface of the reinforcement and soil. But it is to be noted that the sheet with adhesive dried has a marked influence on the bearing capacity especially at lower densities. The strip reinforcements in single pattern {{is considered to be a}} favorable choice for minimum reinforcement. The strip reinforcement in single or grid pattern gives sufficient improvement in strength...|$|R

The reservoir sands were deposited during early-drift sedimentation in the Bredasdorp Basin. Paleo-current {{flows from the}} west, filling the basin with sediments that are eroded off the continental shelf (Agulhus Arch) and deposited {{on the base of}} the continental slope and basin floor. Turbidite flows off the Agulhus arch have deposited the Sable Fields reservoirs, where the larger channelized reservoir body takes an 80 ° bend off the continental slope and flows onto the basin floor. This 3 -D reservoir highlights the reservoirs internal heterogeneity and complexity at the well bore and away from the well bore. Well tops tie wells to the 3 -D seismic cube for; reservoir location and delineation, velocity modelling and subsequent conversion of the mapped surfaces from time to depth. Core and petro-physical analysis were used to outline the depositional facies within the investigated wells namely: E-BD 5, E-BD 2, E-BD 1 and E-CE 1. Correlation of depositional facies at the well bore with their corresponding seismic facies, allows for extrapolation of facies away from the well bore. The internal heterogeneity of the reservoir is outlined using an integrated methodology, which is based on log scale depositional features (channels, sheets, lobes) that are extrapolated to field scale (sand rich complex) using corresponding top and base reservoir seismic responses. The investigated thick region of sediment accumulation on: the continental slope, the base of the continental slope and basin floor is deposited on the 13 AT 1 early drift unconformity. The reservoir is outlined from the up-dip to the down-dip reaches of the field. Well E–BD 5 has tapped into the proximal region (up-dip), with reservoir comprising of amalgamated channel sands that are deposited by laterally switching and stacking channelized sand bodies. Channel meander facies are seen in the upper portion of the reservoir, with massive channel fill in the lower parts. The channel fill {{constitutes a}} high net to gross with little to no lateral facies variations. This confined environment is dominated by amalgamated massive sands (on-axis) that are thinner bedded towards the banks of the channels (off-axis). A high degree of channel amalgamation has been interpreted in both up-dip wells E-BD 5 and E-BD 2. This channelized reservoir is at least 2 km wide and 6 km long, before the larger channel makes a rapid 80 ° change in paleo-current direction. This is possibly the result of basin floor topography and the stacking of previously deposited sand complexes which alter local sea floor topography. The vertical and lateral continuity of the channelised reservoir is generally excellent due to the high degree of channel amalgamation. The stacked channel complex constitutes a gross thickness of 76. 2 m (68. 5 m Net sand) in well E-BD 5, and a gross thickness 25 m (23 m Net sand) in well E-BD 2. Channel sands in well E-BD 5 have an average porosity of 15 % while the average porosity of channel sands in well E-BD 2 (further down-dip) is 17 %. This up-dip channelised region results in high amplitude reflections due to hydrocarbon charged sand juxtaposed against hemipelagic muds and silty levee facies. Well E-BD 1 has tapped into a relatively confined sand complex deposited {{at the base of the}} continental slope. The amalgamated lobe and <b>sheet</b> <b>sand</b> complex is entirely encased in hemi pelagic mud. These reservoir sands are interpreted to be deposited in the Channel Lobe Transition Zone (CLTZ), thus the reservoir sands are interpreted to have a transitional depositional style (generally channelized sheets). The CLTZ region is thus dominated by both channel complex and lobe complex elements. The E-BD 1 reservoir constitutes a number of amalgamated elements that result in a reservoir zone with an average porosity of 16. 4 %. These include: amalgamated thick bedded <b>sheet</b> <b>sand</b> (lobe axis) associated with deep depositional feeder channels; thin bedded sheet sands (off lobe axis), broad thin amalgamated lobe elements, layered thick bedded sand sheets and deep broad depositional channels. The low sinuosity broad depositional-channels and elongate lobe elements are expressed as lobate amalgamated sheets of sand which is up to 2 - 3 km wide, 5 km long and 30 m thick (29. 7 m nett sand) at the well bore. Well E-CE 1 has intersected 50 m thick reservoir sand (50 m nett sand) which constitutes the axis of a lobe complex where the reservoir zone has an average porosity of 14 %. The sand rich complex is deposited on the unconfined basin floor. This reservoir complex constitutes amalgamated thick bedded lobe architectural elements which are massive in nature. The laterally continuous hydrocarbon charged lobe elements result in bright parallel seismic reflections. The amalgamated lobe complex is more than 5 km wide. Sub-parallel horizons are attributed to the thin bedded off axis portion of the lobe complex where the net to gross is considerably less than the highly amalgamated axis of the lobe complex. The lobe complex has a moderate to good net to gross of 40 - 60 %. The high aspect ratio of the lobe complex severely impacts the reservoirs vertical permeability, however horizontal permeability is quite good due to the extensive lateral continuity of good quality sheet sands. Based on the nature deep water architectural elements observed in this study, the internal heterogeneity of the Basin floor Fan and Basin floor channel complex’s may constitute an entire sand rich reservoir zone. All the sands may be in hydraulic communication if they are genetically related. These sands and stretch from the up-dip (wells E-BD 5 & E-BD 2) through to the transitional (E-BD 2) and pinching out in the distal regions (E-CE 1) on the basin floor. The seal constitutes a prominent shale horizon T 13 PW 3 (8 - 10 m thick) which is draped over the entire reservoir complex. This top seal is extrapolated from all the wells and correlated with seismic facies, thus outlining the lateral continuity and thickness variations of the top seal. This draped shale horizon exposes the thick axial portion of the amalgamated channel complex and amalgamated lobe complex...|$|E
40|$|To {{statistically}} {{test and}} evaluate the significance of asymmetric upward thickening and thinning trends and other cyclic patterns in turbidite successions, twenty-eight bed-by-bed sections with a wide coverage in geological time, tectonic settings, facies characteristics, and depositional environments were measured and described. First, 286 sandstone packets were selected from the 28 turbidite sections through statistically based segmentation. Then, these packets were examined by three powerful correlation tests (Kendall's, Spearman's, and Pearson's correlation tests) and four tests for randomness. Only 34 (11. 9 %) of the sandstone packets pass tests designed to identify asymmetry at the 10 % significance level. Monte Carlo simulation and the binomial probability analysis indicate {{that the number of}} asymmetric sequences identified in the original set of turbidite sandstone packets is indistinguishable from the number which can be produced by random processes. [...] Eighty-six sandstone packets were tested for upward coarsening and fining trends. It was found that as many as 50 % of sandstone packets from coarse-grained channel fills fine or coarsen upward. Upward fining sequences dominate, which is interpreted as the result of channel filling or the stacking of onlapping deposits at a channel mouth. [...] The Hurst statistic provides a measure of long-term persistence. Sixteen (84. 2 %) of 19 turbidite sections show the Hurst phenomenon, i. e., irregular and non-periodic clustering of high and low values of bed-thickness, grain-size, and sandstone percentage. This clustering is related to vertical changes of sedimentary facies caused by lateral shifting of environments on the fan surface. The strength of the clustering, inferred from Hurst K values, might be useful as an index to distinguish submarine fan environments: channel-Ievee complexes tend to have strong clustering; lobe-interlobe deposits tend to display moderate clustering; and basin-floor <b>sheet</b> <b>sand</b> systems tend to have weak clustering. [...] Combining facies characteristics observed in the field with the statistical results provides some criteria for the identification of submarine fan environments, and yields four preliminary fan models. (1) Type 1 sandy fans typically form in forearc basins, are fed by littoral sources or fan deltas, and are characterized by very coarse (pebbly sandy) sediments. Both channel and lobe deposits are well developed. A significant number of upward fining sequences can be found in channel deposits. Channel-interchannel complexes, particularly channel-levee complexes, display strong clustering of bed-thickness, grain-size and other parameters. (2) Type 2 sandy fans mainly form in forearc basins but also in foreland basins, and are fed by littoral sources or small rivers. The basic features of this model {{are similar to those of}} model 1, but pebbly sediments are absent or rare, and upward fining sequences lack significance. (3) Type 1 muddy fans tend to form in passive margins, foreland basins or foredeeps, and are fed by a large river delta. They are typically characterized by nested sandy bodies of channel and crevasse-splay-lobe deposits in very well-developed muddy levee deposits, which causes strong clustering of bed-thickness, grain-size and other parameters. Channels might gradually die out without a sandy lobe at the end. (4) Type 2 muddy fans form in the same tectonic settings as model 3, but sediments are mainly derived from failure at the shelf break, resulting in well-developed megaturbidite beds with thick mud caps. The large, muddy turbidity currents responsible for these beds are usually unchannelized and efficiently transport sandy sediments to form wide spread basin-floor sand sheets...|$|E
40|$|Aeolian {{periglacial}} sand deposits {{are common}} in the Tuktoyaktuk Coastlands of Western Arctic Canada. Regionally extensive and thick aeolian sand-sheet deposits have been observed in two major stratigraphic settings: within a sand unit characterized by large aeolian dune deposits; and interbedded with glaciofluvial outwash from the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS). Small, localized <b>sand</b> <b>sheets</b> have also been observed along the tops of sandy bluffs, within sequences of drained thermokarst lakes deposits and as an involuted veneer above buried basal ice of the LIS. On the basis of radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dates from preserved periglacial aeolian <b>sand</b> <b>sheets</b> and dunes a regional chronostratigraphy is presented which indicates that both extensive dunes and <b>sand</b> <b>sheets</b> accumulated mainly between ca 30 and 13 ka. A switch to dominantly sand-sheet aggradation at ca 14 – 13 ka, with <b>sand</b> <b>sheets</b> forming widely until ca 8 ka, is attributed to (a) surface armouring by glacial deposits associated with the advance of the LIS; and (b) amelioration of the climate from cold aridity. An absence of OSL dates between ca 8 and 1 ka suggests that <b>sand</b> <b>sheets</b> stabilized {{during much of the}} Holocene. Local sand-sheet aggradation during recent centuries has occurred near sandy bluffs and on the floors of drained thermokarst lakes. The OSL dates constrain the maximum extent of the LIS in the Tuktoyaktuk Coastlands to Marine Isotope Stage 2. ...|$|R

Ardestan Region is prone to land degradation and masked by <b>sand</b> <b>sheets,</b> <b>sand</b> dunes, clay flats, desert pavement and different kinds of salt crust due to dry climate. To study the trends of land degradation in last three decades, four satellite data sets of Landsat MSS, Landsat TM, Landsat ETM+ and IRS acquired in 1976, 1990, 2001 and 2008, respectively were analyzed. The time series analysis revealed that the bare clayflats have decreased and clayflats with vegetation cover have expanded over 32 years. During this period, the areas which are covered by gravel have decreased 13 percent and both the area covered by salt crusts and aeolians have extended 2 percent.
