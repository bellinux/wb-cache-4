40|$|Abstract – Arguably, {{computer-aided}} design {{has emerged as}} the most significant change agent in manufacturing during the past decade. The switch from constructive solid geometry based <b>solid</b> <b>modeling</b> systems to parametric <b>solid</b> <b>modeling</b> has positively impacted manufacturing industries worldwide. <b>Solid</b> <b>modeling</b> technology has now advanced to a stage where it has become the precursor to a wide array of engineering analyses including finite element analysis. These recent developments suggest that we can make a case for a mandatory course in <b>solid</b> <b>modeling</b> enabled manufacturing analysis for all manufacturing engineering and technology majors. Until recently, the manufacturing engineering technology degree program at Northern Illinois University did not require students to take a course in <b>solid</b> <b>modeling</b> or kinematic analysis. This paper describes the efforts made by the authors to fill this void that existed in the curriculum. We pose a rationale for establishing a new course and describe the planning and specific implementation details of the resulting three-credit course in <b>solid</b> <b>modeling</b> and manufacturing analysis...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{origins and}} basic {{principles}} of <b>solid</b> <b>modeling</b> will be reviewed. Topics to be coveredinclude a detailed look at the primitive solids and their mathematical descriptions, a review of boolean mathematics for solids combination, {{and the use of}} homogeneous coor-dinates for object positioning. References to various existing <b>solid</b> <b>modeling</b> systems will be given. As a case study of a modern <b>solid</b> <b>modeling</b> system, the U. S. Army Ballistic ResearchLaboratory's (BRL) <b>solid</b> <b>modeling</b> system will be described. In addition to an overview of the constructive <b>solid</b> <b>modeling</b> based geometric design editor's (MGED) features andoperations, examples of constructing objects using MGED will be presented. MGED's capabilities, command interface, code organization and internal editing states will be dis-cussed. Important considerations in preparing and organizing large models will be presented. A detailed investigation of the algorithms needed to ray-trace a <b>solids</b> <b>model</b> will be pre-sented. The mathematics of ray-solid intersection will be shown for three primitive solids. Bounding volumes will be discussed, along with boolean expression tree evalua-tion. The general data structures, code organization, and space partitioning algorithms of BRL's ray tracing package (RT) will be reviewed, and a sample application will be given. An overview of how ray-tracing of <b>solids</b> <b>models</b> can be applied to compute informationabout the properties of the structure being modeled will be given.

Algorithms for computing integral properties for various solid representation schemes are fairly well known.

50|$|The {{standard}} linear <b>solid</b> <b>model</b> effectively {{combines the}} Maxwell model and a Hookean spring in parallel. A viscous material is modeled as a spring and a dashpot {{in series with}} each other, {{both of which are}} in parallel with a lone spring. For this model, the governing constitutive relation is:Under a constant stress, the modeled material will instantaneously deform to some strain, which is the elastic portion of the strain, and after that it will continue to deform and asymptotically approach a steady-state strain. This last portion is the viscous part of the strain. Although the Standard Linear <b>Solid</b> <b>Model</b> is more accurate than the Maxwell and Kelvin-Voigt models in predicting material responses, mathematically it returns inaccurate results for strain under specific loading conditions and is rather difficult to calculate.|$|E

40|$|Computer-Aided Design {{data and}} <b>Solid</b> <b>Models</b> are of immense {{importance}} across {{the full spectrum}} of engineering disciplines. Current industrial estimates point to the existence of over 30 billion CAD models in the world, with increasing numbers of them including 3 D <b>solid</b> <b>models.</b> While the database and data mining communities have made great strides in management of image, audio and video media, little work exists on how to perform engineering, content-based mining of CAD data and <b>solid</b> <b>models.</b> CAD data, and the engineering consumers of CAD data, have greatly different needs and requirements from traditional database multimedia: large, individual database elements; multi-disciplinary components (mechanical, electrical, etc.) with unique access critera; and the lack of an accepted set of readily identifiable features {{that can be used for}} model indexing and clustering. This paper presents our approach to perform similarity-based clustering on large databases of <b>solid</b> <b>models</b> of mechanical CAD designs. A publicly available source of <b>solid</b> <b>models</b> is the National Design Repository ([URL] which contains over 55, 000 publicly available <b>solid</b> <b>models</b> from many different engineering disciplines.
