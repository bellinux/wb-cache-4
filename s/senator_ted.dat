5|$|During the luncheon, <b>Senator</b> <b>Ted</b> Kennedy {{collapsed}} {{after suffering}} a seizure, and he was transported to a hospital for medical treatment. Early reports about the medical emergency suggested erroneously that Senator Robert Byrd, the oldest member of the Senate, also fell ill during the luncheon. These reports were later denied, and Byrd, {{a longtime friend of}} Kennedy, eventually explained that the Kennedy incident disturbed him and caused him to leave.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{entered his}} name on the New Hampshire primary ballot on January 5, 1972, {{effectively}} announcing his candidacy for reelection. Virtually assured the Republican nomination, the President had initially expected his Democratic opponent to be Massachusetts <b>Senator</b> <b>Ted</b> Kennedy (brother of the late president), but he was largely removed from contention after the 1969 Chappaquiddick incident. Instead, Maine Senator Edmund Muskie became the front runner, with South Dakota Senator George McGovern in a close second place.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{the death}} of U.S. <b>Senator</b> <b>Ted</b> Kennedy, Massachusetts state law {{triggered}} a special election {{to be held in}} January 2010. On September 4, 2009, a representative for Lynch took out nomination papers to run in the special election. After speaking with his family and citing the short time frame in which to conduct a campaign, Lynch decided against seeking the Democratic nomination for the seat.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{prominent}} {{local and national}} politicians and judges are Providence College alumni. Former United States Senator from Connecticut Chris Dodd graduated in 1966 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English literature, while his father, Thomas J.

5|$|After {{training}} as a teacher at Bede College, Durham University, he was not called up for military service during World War II, because teaching was a reserved occupation. After the war he improved his qualifications by taking a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) at Loughborough College in 1947. In the 1950s he studied at St Peter's College, Oxford, where he was awarded a diploma in public and social administration with distinction and won a Fulbright Scholarship to Harvard {{in his second year}} (1954), becoming a friend of the future <b>Senator</b> <b>Ted</b> Kennedy.|$|E

5|$|By 1993, Romney {{had begun}} {{thinking}} about entering politics, partly based upon Ann's urging and partly {{to follow in}} his father's footsteps. He decided to challenge incumbent Democratic U.S. <b>Senator</b> <b>Ted</b> Kennedy, who was seeking re-election for the sixth time. Political pundits viewed Kennedy as vulnerable that year– {{in part because of}} the unpopularity of the Democratic Congress as a whole, and in part because this was Kennedy's first election since the William Kennedy Smith trial in Florida, in which the senator's reputation for character had suffered. Romney changed his affiliation to Republican in October 1993 and formally announced his candidacy in February 1994. In addition to his leave from Bain Capital, Romney also stepped down from his church leadership role in 1994.|$|E
5|$|Democratic U.S. <b>Senator</b> <b>Ted</b> Kennedy was re-elected in 2006, {{and died}} on August 25, 2009 from a {{malignant}} brain tumor. On September 24, 2009, Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick appointed {{longtime friend of}} Kennedy and former Democratic National Committee Chairman Paul G. Kirk to succeed Kennedy until a special election could be held. Kirk's appointment was especially controversial, as the Governor's ability to appoint an interim Senator was removed during the Romney administration by the Democratic-controlled legislature, as a precaution if Senator and presidential nominee John Kerry was elected President in 2004. Laws surrounding Senate appointment were quickly changed following Kennedy's death. The Massachusetts Republican Party sued {{in an attempt to}} halt Kirk's appointment, but it was rejected by Suffolk Superior Court Judge Thomas Connolly.|$|E
5|$|Incumbent Republican Senator Scott Brown ran for {{re-election}} to a first full term. He {{had been elected}} in a special election in 2010 {{following the death of}} incumbent Democratic <b>Senator</b> <b>Ted</b> Kennedy. Brown faced no challengers from his own party. For the Democrats, an initial wide field of prospective candidates narrowed after the entry of Harvard Law School Professor Elizabeth Warren, the architect of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Warren clinched near-unanimous party support, with {{all but one of the}} other Democratic candidates withdrawing following her entrance. After winning her party's nomination, eliminating any need for a primary, she faced Brown in the general election.|$|E

5|$|Brown is {{a member}} of the Republican Party, and faced the Democratic candidate, Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley in the 2010 special election, which had {{occurred}} after the 2009 death of long-time <b>Senator</b> <b>Ted</b> Kennedy for the remainder of Kennedy's term ending January 3, 2013. While initially trailing Coakley in polling by a large margin, Brown saw a sudden late surge in the polls and posted a surprise win to become the first Republican elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts since Edward Brooke in 1972. Brown ran for a full Senate term in 2012, but lost to Democratic challenger Elizabeth Warren. He subsequently joined the board of directors of Kadant paper company, joined Fox News as a commentator, and joined Nixon Peabody where he provided legal services.|$|E
5|$|During his 1980 campaign, Reagan pledged that, {{if given}} the {{opportunity}}, he would appoint the first female Supreme Court Justice. That opportunity came {{in his first year}} in office when he nominated Sandra Day O'Connor to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of Justice Potter Stewart. In his second term, Reagan elevated William Rehnquist to succeed Warren E. Burger as Chief Justice, and named Antonin Scalia to fill the vacant seat. Reagan nominated conservative jurist Robert Bork to the high court in 1987. <b>Senator</b> <b>Ted</b> Kennedy, a Democrat of Massachusetts, strongly condemned Bork, and great controversy ensued. Bork's nomination was rejected 58–42. Reagan then nominated Douglas Ginsburg, but Ginsburg withdrew his name from consideration after coming under fire for his cannabis use. Anthony Kennedy was eventually confirmed in his place. Along with his three Supreme Court appointments, Reagan appointed 83 judges to the United States courts of appeals, and 290 judges to the United States district courts.|$|E
5|$|In June 1989, Obama met Michelle Robinson {{when he was}} {{employed}} as a summer associate at the Chicago law firm of Sidley Austin. Assigned for three months as Obama's adviser at the firm, Robinson joined him at several group social functions, but declined his initial requests to date. They began dating later that summer, became engaged in 1991, and were married on October 3, 1992. The couple's first daughter, Malia Ann, was born on July 4, 1998, followed by a second daughter, Natasha ("Sasha"), on June 10, 2001. The Obama daughters attended the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools. When they moved to Washington, D.C., in January 2009, the girls started at the Sidwell Friends School. The Obamas have two Portuguese Water Dogs; the first, a male named Bo, {{was a gift from}} <b>Senator</b> <b>Ted</b> Kennedy. In August 2013, Bo was joined by Sunny, a female.|$|E
50|$|As {{reported}} by The New York Times, conservative activists, supported by {{funds from the}} billionaire Koch brothers and conservative political action committees, worked with Tea Party-affiliated members of Congress, such as <b>Senators</b> <b>Ted</b> Cruz and Mike Lee, to promote an appropriations bill that would exclude funds for the Affordable Care Act.|$|R

5000|$|The Shoffner Act was {{intended}} to restore order in North Carolina counties where Ku Klux Klan (KKK) violence raged. Introduced by Alamance County Republican <b>senator</b> <b>T.</b> M.

5|$|Sotomayor {{was thus}} {{nominated}} on November 27, 1991, by President George H. W. Bush {{to a seat}} on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York vacated by John M. Walker, Jr. Senate Judiciary Committee hearings, led by a friendly Democratic majority, went smoothly for her in June 1992, with her pro bono activities winning praise from <b>Senator</b> <b>Ted</b> Kennedy and her getting unanimous approval from the committee. Then a Republican senator blocked her nomination and that of three others for a while in retaliation for an unrelated block Democrats had put on another nominee. D'Amato objected strongly; some weeks later, the block was dropped, and Sotomayor was confirmed by unanimous consent of the full United States Senate on August 11, 1992, and received her commission the next day.|$|E
5|$|The act {{has also}} faced {{challenges}} and opposition. In 2009, <b>Senator</b> <b>Ted</b> Kennedy died, {{and the resultant}} special election cost the Democrats their 60-seat filibuster-proof Senate majority before the ACA had been fully passed by Congress. The Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 in 2012 that states could choose {{not to participate in}} the ACA's Medicaid expansion, although it upheld the law as a whole. The federal health exchange, HealthCare.gov, initially faced major technical problems during its rollout in 2013. In 2017, a unified Republican government failed to pass several different partial repeals of the ACA. The law spent several years opposed by a slim plurality of Americans polled, although its provisions were generally more popular than the law as a whole, and the law gained plurality support by 2017.|$|E
