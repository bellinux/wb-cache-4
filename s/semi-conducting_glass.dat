40|$|A test of planar spark {{counters}} (PSC’s. 1 at the PEP electron- positron {{storage ring}} showed the following. PSC’s {{can be used}} under harsh experimental conditions without long term degradation of resolution. On line time-of-flight resolutions were &low 200 psec, coordinate resolutions better than 4 mm, both limited to these values by the resistivity of the <b>semi-conducting</b> <b>glass</b> and the electronics used. The best single counter time resolution under realistic conditions at the storage ring was 76 psec. Pulse height was a good indicator {{of the number of}} particles striking a counter. Subsequent measurements using cosmic rays gave Planar spark counters (PSC’sICll are particle detecting devices designed mainly for very good time resolution. The basic principles of their operation can briefly be described as follows. Two planar electrodes are mounted parallel with a gap width of typi...|$|E
40|$|Research interests: Applied {{research}} conducted {{to investigate the}} atomic and electronic structure of technologically important materials, and in particular <b>semi-conducting</b> chalcogenide <b>glasses.</b> Thermal properties are also studied. Emphasis was aimed at identifying the structure-property relationships {{in order to assess}} the suitability of the use of these materials in devices. Techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were employed in the course of these investigations. Experience in EXAFS is gained on many international facilities such as the British synchrotron facility at Daresbury, the French synchrotron one (L. U. R. E.), Orsay and the Italian facility (ELETRA) at Trieste. Surface science experience in XPS is gained using...|$|R
