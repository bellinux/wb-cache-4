Plans were drawn up to {{demolish}} the old part of Christianshavn {{and to get}} rid of the worst of the city's slum areas. However, it was not until the 1930s that substantial housing developments ensued, with the demolition of one side of Christianhavn's Torvegade in order to build five large blocks of flats.|$|E

Suicide and desertions were common due to boredom, <b>shortages</b> <b>of</b> food and the poor living conditions. At Middle Hill Battery, guards had to be posted to prevent soldiers from deserting by lowering themselves on ropes down the cliff face.|$|E

40|$|The {{profession}} {{is facing a}} unique <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> nursing faculty. Schools of Nursing {{have always had a}} <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> doctorally prepared nursing faculty. The academic norm for faculty teaching in baccalaureate and graduate programs to hold earned doctoral degrees was established later in nursing than for other disciplines. At best, 50 % of nursing faculty in such programs have met this academic standard. In addition, the shortage is predicted to escalate in the next decade due to the retirement of a "graying professoriate" of nursing faculty. The <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> nursing faculty is interwoven with the current national <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> nurses. The <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> nurses requires the educational programs of the profession to supply more graduates. But the <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> nursing faculty will limit student enrollments and likely decrease the number of graduates. Conversely, the <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> nurses will offer many opportunities and choices to nurses and may decrease the number selecting graduate studies and an academic career, thus contributing to the <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> nursing faculty The <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> nursing faculty will also have consequences for the generation of the knowledge base for nursing practice. With a decreased number of individuals to conduct research and the loss of senior investigators through retirement, continuing development of nursing's knowledge base may be curtailed. The <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> nursing faculty will also limit the professional leaders who are able to shape health policy in the state, national, and international arenas. This article outlines a number of factors influencing the <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> nursing faculty. Several institutional School of Nursing strategies are suggested for countering the shortage situation. In addition, several national professional and policy strategies are suggested. More creative strategies need to be developed and evaluated by Schools of Nursing and by the profession...|$|R

40|$|MM thesis - P&DMCharlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic (CMJA) Hospital has {{experienced}} a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> critical beds {{for a period of}} more than thirteen years without investigating the factors that are contributing to the <b>shortage.</b> The purpose <b>of</b> {{this study was to determine}} the underlying factors that contributed to the <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> critical care beds at the CMJA Hospital. The study also focused on the implications of the hospital strategic plan regarding the factors identified, and proposed interventions to resolve the <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> critical care beds at the CMJA hospital. The hospital’s strategic plan had measures in place to begin to address the shortage. Findings revealed that the main factor that contributed to the <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> critical care beds at the hospital was the <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> critical care nurses. The study recommended that the South African Nursing Council should develop a curriculum for lower categories of nurses to function in critical care areas...|$|R

Researcher rate the <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> teachers in agriculture as a top problem facing the agricultural education profession. But does a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> agricultural education exist? Some suggest that that a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> “quality ” teachers exists, not a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> qualified teachers. This study sought to answer those questions. Results {{of this study indicate that}} in this state, in this year, a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> qualified agricultural education teachers did not exist. Further, a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> “quality ” teachers did not exist as administrators expressed satisfaction with the potential teachers they interviews. Administrators in this study placed enthusiasm for teaching and the use of community relations skills as the most important factors they look for when hiring an agricultural education teacher. This supports Cantrell’s (2003) research which found that administrators sought candidates who could orally present their knowledge of agriculture in an enthusiastic manner and who could develop rapport with members of the community. Experience in production agriculture, college activities, and grade point average were placed at the bottom of a list of presented candidate qualities...|$|R
