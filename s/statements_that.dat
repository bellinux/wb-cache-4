5000|$|A false {{statement}} is a <b>statement</b> <b>that</b> is not true. Although the word fallacy is sometimes {{used as a}} synonym for false <b>statement,</b> <b>that</b> is not how the word is used in philosophy, mathematics, logic and most formal contexts.|$|R
5|$|In the {{conclusion}} of his Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, Scottish philosopher David Hume argued that <b>statements</b> <b>that</b> make claims about reality must be verified by experience, and dismissed those that cannot be verified as meaningless. Hume regarded most religious language as unverifiable by experiment and so dismissed it.|$|E
5|$|A {{statement}} is considered falsifiable {{if there is}} an observation or a test that could be made that would demonstrate that the {{statement is}} false. <b>Statements</b> <b>that</b> are not falsifiable cannot be examined by scientific investigation since they permit no tests that evaluate their accuracy. Creationists such as Henry M. Morris have claimed that any observation can be fitted into the evolutionary framework, so it is impossible to demonstrate that evolution is wrong and therefore evolution is non-scientific.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} Johnson {{submitted}} the contributory negligence defense, {{he had not}} yet been able to speak to Polehinke himself. By the time newspapers reported on the court documents, Johnson said he had already told Royse, who criticized the <b>statements,</b> <b>that</b> he would withdraw the argument. Prior to his employment by Comair, Polehinke worked for Gulfstream International as a captain.|$|E

5000|$|The {{series of}} {{statements}} regarding the Logos {{at the very}} beginning of the Gospel of John build on each other. The <b>statement</b> <b>that</b> the Logos existed [...] "at the beginning" [...] asserts that as Logos Jesus was an eternal being like God. The <b>statement</b> <b>that</b> the Logos was [...] "with God" [...] asserts the distinction of Jesus from God. The <b>statement</b> <b>that</b> the Logos [...] "was God" [...] states the unity of Jesus with God, thus stating his divinity.|$|R

5|$|During {{his time}} in Sussex Wilfrid was {{reconciled}} with Archbishop Theodore; the Vita Sancti Wilfrithi says that Theodore expressed a desire for Wilfrid to succeed him at Canterbury. Wilfrid {{may have been involved}} in founding monasteries near Bath as well as in other parts of Sussex, but the evidence backing this is based on the wording used in the founding charters resembling wording used by Wilfrid in other charters, not on any concrete <b>statements</b> <b>that</b> Wilfrid was involved.|$|E
5|$|Image <b>statements</b> <b>that</b> {{include a}} series of {{pictures}} or images of original paper checks and/or substitute checks, photocopies of the original checks, and images of checks posted online are not recognized as the legal equivalents of substitute checks. Unlike a substitute check, a photocopy of a check cannot be presented through the check clearing process for settlement because the photocopy of the check does not adhere strictly to the requirements for substitute checks under the Check21 Act.|$|E
5|$|Testing the {{validity}} of astrology can be difficult, {{because there is no}} consensus amongst astrologers as to what astrology is or what it can predict. Most professional astrologers are paid to predict the future or describe a person's personality and life, but most horoscopes only make vague untestable <b>statements</b> <b>that</b> can apply to almost anyone.|$|E

5|$|The PROC step {{consists}} of PROC <b>statements</b> <b>that</b> call upon named procedures. Procedures perform analysis and reporting on data sets to produce statistics, analyses, and graphics. There {{are more than}} 300 procedures and each one contains a substantial body of programming and statistical work. PROC statements can also display results, sort data or perform other operations.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} {{numerous}} <b>statements</b> <b>that</b> could have borne the name Ramanujan conjecture, there is one that was highly influential on later work. In particular, the connection of this conjecture with conjectures of André Weil in algebraic geometry opened up new areas of research. That Ramanujan conjecture is an assertion {{on the size of}} the tau-function, which has as generating function the discriminant modular form Δ(q), a typical cusp form in the theory of modular forms. It was finally proven in 1973, as a consequence of Pierre Deligne's proof of the Weil conjectures. The reduction step involved is complicated. Deligne won a Fields Medal in 1978 for that work.|$|E
5|$|Born to {{a working-class}} Italian American family in Dudley, Massachusetts, {{he was raised}} Roman Catholic {{although}} became interested in esotericism as a teenager. He later claimed {{that when he was}} 21, relatives initiated him into a tradition of witchcraft inherited from their Sicilian ancestors; this conflicts with other <b>statements</b> <b>that</b> he made, and there is no independent evidence to corroborate his claim. During the 1950s, he was based in New York City, where he worked as a graphologist and hypnotist. After beginning to publish books on paranormal topics in the early 1960s, he publicly began identifying as Wiccan in 1969, and stated that he was involved in a New York coven.|$|E

(The finiteness is used crucially in the proofs.) ...|$|R
5|$|In {{his first}} {{statement}} {{he said he}} had handed the report to Rudolf Kastner on 26 April 1944 during the latter's visit to Bratislava, but Bauer writes that the report was not finished until 27 April. In another statement, Krasniansky said he had passed it to Kastner on 28 April in Bratislava, but Hansi Brand, Kastner's lover and the wife of Joel Brand, said that Kastner was not in Bratislava until August. It is clear from Kastner's post-war <b>statements</b> <b>that</b> he did have early access to the report, Bauer writes, but perhaps not in April. According to Randolph L. Braham, Kastner had a copy by 3 May, when he paid a visit to Kolozsvár (Cluj), his home town.|$|E
5|$|Lamont won {{the primary}} with 51.79 {{percent of the}} vote as opposed to Lieberman's 48.21 percent; it was the only Senate race in 2006 where an {{incumbent}} lost re-nomination. In his concession speech, Lieberman announced that he would stand by his prior <b>statements</b> <b>that</b> he'd run as an independent if he lost the Democratic primary. Lieberman won the general election with approximately 50 {{percent of the vote}}; exit polls showed that Lieberman won the vote of 33 percent of Democrats, 54 percent of independents, and 70 percent of Republicans.|$|E
5|$|On March 7, 2016, Bevin {{released}} a video {{on social media}} claiming that House Democrats were not following through on their obligations to help craft the state budget. Legislators responded with a photo and <b>statements</b> <b>that</b> while Bevin was producing his film designed to chastise them, House leaders were in fact in committee meetings working out details of a budget proposal while Speaker Stumbo suggested the Governor was either unfamiliar with the legislative process, or intended to deceive people. On March 12, House Democrats released their own budget, which sustained most of the cuts to executive agencies in Bevin's budget, but exempted public universities from any cuts. The Republican-controlled Senate countered with a proposal that hewed closely to Bevin's original budget.|$|E

5|$|The {{arguments}} for evolution being a religion generally amount to arguments by analogy: {{it is argued}} that evolution and religion have one or more things in common, and that therefore evolution is a religion. Examples of claims made in such arguments are <b>statements</b> <b>that</b> evolution is based on faith, and that supporters of evolution dogmatically reject alternative suggestions out-of-hand. These claims have become more popular in recent years as the neo-creationist movement has sought to distance itself from religion, thus giving it more reason to make use of a seemingly anti-religious analogy.|$|E
5|$|The {{variety of}} {{positivism}} that remains dominant today is termed instrumental positivism. This approach eschews epistemological and metaphysical concerns (such as {{the nature of}} social facts) in favour of methodological clarity, replicability, reliability and validity. This positivism {{is more or less}} synonymous with quantitative research, and so only resembles older positivism in practice. Since it carries no explicit philosophical commitment, its practitioners may not belong to any particular school of thought. Modern sociology of this type is often credited to Paul Lazarsfeld, who pioneered large-scale survey studies and developed statistical techniques for analysing them. This approach lends itself to what Robert K. Merton called middle-range theory: abstract <b>statements</b> <b>that</b> generalize from segregated hypotheses and empirical regularities rather than starting with an abstract idea of a social whole.|$|E
5|$|When Linda was {{predicted}} to turn towards the northeast, it was forecast to move ashore in southern California as a weak tropical storm, {{which would have}} made Linda the first to do so since a tropical storm in 1939. The Oxnard, California National Weather Service office issued public information and special weather <b>statements</b> <b>that</b> discussed the possible impact of Linda on southern California. The advisories mentioned forecasting uncertainty, and advised the media not to exaggerate the storm. The office noted a threat for significant rainfall—possibly causing flash flooding—as well as high surf. To prepare for possible flooding, workers cleaned storm drains and prepared sandbags for coastal properties.|$|E
