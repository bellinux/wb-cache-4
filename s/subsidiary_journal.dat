40|$|Abstract. As {{the system}} of records that a {{business}} keeps to provide financial information, AIS has based its design on some fundamental principles. An accounting system is comprised of accounting records {{and a series of}} processes and procedures assigned to staff, volunteers, and/or outside professionals, which traditionally includes source documents, special <b>journals,</b> <b>subsidiary</b> <b>journals</b> and general journals. In recent years, because of the development of IT industry, manual-based accounting information system has been replaced by AIS. AIS brings with a set of new problems. The internal controls that have been put into place for a manual system to help the internal auditor cannot fully prevent or minimize the possibility of errors or fraud that come with the computerized systems. Therefore the old controls must be modified for the new system and new controls must be put in. Only then can the internal auditor ensure that the number of errors that occur within the system be minimized or even eliminated...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{investigate}} how multinationality affects firms’ risk levels. Our investigation {{builds on the}} idea from real options theory that international operations offer switching options to multinational corporations, yet we also emphasize different sources of coordination costs that can mitigate the benefits of operational flexibility. The findings from Tobit models accounting for self-selection underscore the importance of unobserved heterogeneity in the relationships between international investments and risk levels. Consistent with the coordination costs surrounding international operations, {{we find that the}} relationship between multinationality and downside risk is curvilinear: risk first declines and then increases as a firm's portfolio of international investments becomes extensive. In addition, downside risk is an increasing function of the average cultural distance between a firm's home base and the host countries in which its foreign <b>subsidiaries</b> operate. <b>Journal</b> of International Business Studies (2007) 38, 215 – 230. doi: 10. 1057 /palgrave. jibs. 8400260...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} extent to which {{different}} human resource management (HRM) practices work better in different countries. We also try to open the black box between HRM and multinational enterprise (MNE) subsidiary performance by considering mechanisms through which HRM practices affect MNE subsidiary performance. The study utilizes a unique data set consisting of subsidiaries of 241 MNEs operating in Russia, USA, and Finland. In the partial least-square analysis used to examine our hypotheses, we demonstrate that different HRM practices are preferable in different countries, and that motivation and ability are important mediating variables in the HRM–MNE <b>subsidiary</b> performance relationship. <b>Journal</b> of International Business Studies (2009) 40, 690 – 712. doi: 10. 1057 /jibs. 2008. 83...|$|R
