Solution-processed electroluminescent (EL) material systems can be continuously deposited onto fiber or yarn substrates in a roll-to-roll process, {{making it easy to}} scale manufacturing. It is important to have precise control over layer deposition to achieve uniform and reliable light emission from these EL fibers. Slot-die coating offers this control and increases the rate of EL fiber production. Here, we report a highly adaptable, cost-effective 3 D printing model for developing <b>slot</b> <b>dies</b> used in automatic coating systems. The resulting slot-die coating system enables rapid, reliable production of alternating current powder-based EL (ACPEL) fibers and can be adapted for many material systems.

The latter cools the molten film back into the solid state and also imparts the desired finish to the plastic surface.

A conductive layer on glass is obtained by spreading {{a layer of}} the dispersion on the surface usually by spin coating and driving out the water by heat. Special PEDOT:PSS inks and formulations were developed for different coating and printing processes. Water-based PEDOT:PSS inks are mainly used in <b>slot</b> <b>die</b> coating, flexography, rotogravure and inkjet printing. If a high viscous paste and slow drying is required like in screen-printing processes PEDOT:PSS can also be supplied in high boiling solvents like propanediol. Dry PEDOT:PSS pellets can be produced with a freeze drying method which are redispersable in water and different solvents, for example ethanol to increase drying speed during printing. Finally, to overcome degradation to ultraviolet light and high temperature or humidity conditions PEDOT:PSS UV-stabilizers are available.|$|E

Includes bibliographical references and (some col. illustrations). Coating tensioned-web running over <b>slot</b> <b>die</b> is an efficient way of depositing thin and uniform layers on flexible web {{at high speed}} with a relatively simple set-up, a combination of <b>slot</b> <b>die</b> pre-metering and carefully controlled web transport. It is different from conventional <b>slot</b> <b>die</b> coating, where the coating gap is maintained by the clearance between backup roll and <b>slot</b> <b>die,</b> in that coating gap is maintained by elastohydrodynamic balance between the tension-resultant force of the curved and tensioned web and the pressure in the coating bead; with this setup much thinner coating gap is made than is possible in conventional <b>slot</b> <b>die</b> coating. For successful operation in tensioned-web coating system, properly designed die is necessary. In conventional <b>slot</b> <b>die</b> coating, pressure profile in the coating bead is well understood and efficiently predicted by considerations based on the one-dimensional viscocapillary model. The model to describe the pressure and gap profiles in tensioned-web <b>slot</b> <b>die</b> coating needs to incorporate {{the interaction between the}} liquid flow and the web deformation, leading to a nonlinear system of equations. In this thesis, coating bead flows and gap profiles in both single-layer and two-layer tensioned-web <b>slot</b> <b>die</b> coating were studied by theoretical model based on shell theory and lubrication approximation, hybridized with two-dimensional flow model when two-dimensional flow model is necessary, and visualization using bench-top web transport system with <b>slot</b> <b>die</b> mounted. The results from visualization and theoretical model study show that a tensioned-web <b>slot</b> <b>die</b> coating die {{can be viewed as a}} combination of component foil bearings. Interpreting the results in this manner, it is easier to predict how the change in die shape and process condition will affect the pressure and gap profiles and therefore easier to design the die shapes required to achieve desired process states, as thin and fast coating, stable two layer coating, or to predict and remove the appearance of microvortexes. By the two-dimensional model on the flow of the two-layer coating, positioning of separation line and appearance of the microvortexes inside the feed slot were studied with the changes in operation condition...|$|E

The fiber diameter of melt blown nonwoven fabrics is strongly influenced by the air jet flow field developed from the sharp <b>die.</b> The dual <b>slot</b> sharp <b>die</b> {{is often used to}} yield polymer fibers in this process. The objective {{of this paper is to}} investigate the fiber diameter of melt blowing nonwovens produced by sharp die using an artificial neural network model. The fiber diameter of melt blowing nonwoven is mostly influenced by processing parameters (polymer flow rate, polymer melt temperature, initial air velocity, die-to-collector distance and initial air temperature). By analyzing the results obtained with the aid of the ANN model, the effects of melt blowing process parameters on the fiber diameter can be predicted.

40|$|Thesis (MTh) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: This thesis aims to {{underline}} {{the importance of the}} sermon introduction. Every sermon generally divides itself into three parts: the introduction, the body and the conclusion. Then, {{what is the purpose of}} the sermon introduction? My research focuses on the sermon introduction in terms of the following two questions: Firstly, what is the precise purpose of the sermon introduction in the dynamics between gaining the attention and not losing the attention? Secondly, what is the influence of the sermon introduction: how can the sermon introduction affect the preacher and the hearer? Chapter 2 explores the identity of the sermon introduction relating to four key aspects: Firstly, the fact that the sermon introduction is the first part of the sermon and is related to the body but has its own integrity. Secondly, the fact that the preacher should investigate the skill of rhetoric because one of the purposes of preaching, like that of rhetoric, is also persuasion. Thirdly, the notion that the âuselessnessâ of the sermon introduction could detach the thoughts of the hearers from the Word of God. Finally, the logical fact that the sermon introduction seems very natural and that it is fitting that a sermon should have an introduction. In Chapter 3 we firstly examine the importance of the sermon introduction relating to the preacher and the hearers. The sermon introduction affects the preacher in proclaiming the Word effectively and the hearers to receive the Word well. And, secondly, we investigate the purposes of the sermon introduction concentrating on the following three aspects: to gain attention; not to lose attention; to introduce the theme. In Chapter 4 we firstly investigate the sources of the sermon introduction. The preacher can utilize the text and context in view of the sermon introduction. We secondly examine the qualities of the sermon introduction, concentrating on the two aspects: positive qualities and negative qualities. In Chapter 5 we emphasize four key aspects of images relating to the sermon introduction: God images, Text images, preacher images and congregational images, all discussed in the light of examples of sermon introductions. In Chapter 6 we make suggestions concerning the following four aspects: Firstly, the length of the sermon introduction. Secondly, time to prepare the sermon introduction. Thirdly, the importance of eye-contact with the hearers. Lastly, constructing some âcheck-listsâ for the sermon introduction.

40|$|Thesis (MEd) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2013. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The {{research}} is about my {{story as a}} learning-support teacher and includes the identity growth that I experienced between the period from January 2001 until December 2012. My approach of acceptance and compassion, within the atmosphere of performativity, leads to my writing process and becomes my auto-ethnographic journey. The writing process brings about change, to experience the performative as an action of âdoingâ (in Giroux 2000 : 135) {{and a way of}} being within day-to-day situations (in Denzin 2004 : 273). By recording my experiences within changing spaces, I hope to make a contribution to academic literature, by drawing the reader into my experiences of the forming of my identity and the explication of the writing process as a journey. Writing my introduction to this research {{at the end of this}} process, I realise that this research has not only changed my story, but also myself as a person. I struggled to bring the story to a close. This is because I have realised that my story is still changing every day. I am becoming a performative ethonographer (Denzin 2004 : 262) and I see concrete situations and engage in a conversation with them. And through this writing experience I have registered an enrichment in my experience. My research does not make use of questionnaires or interviews. It is action-research, experienced in everyday things. My story with remembrances was already there before the research, though never told. Ball (1996) refers to this process as identification. This is the process through which I have gone to be seen, as well as the process through which one goes to see oneself, to a specific identity (quoted by Thompson 2004 : 45). My story begins with questions and reflections about my being different as a white woman, within my context of the two so-called âColoured Schoolsâ. Am I carrying a white scar? (Cixous 1998). I have experienced the writing process as a way of coming into knowledge. My research leads to questions, though not necessarily to answers. The writing process leads to my looking through a different lens of gaining a better understanding. Peace. And hope. I am learning â have learnt â that hope is an ontological necessity. There is a necessity to dream, to change, and to better the lives of others (Freire 1998 : 8 in Denzin 2003 : 263). My research develops rhizomatically (Honan: 2006; Richardson & Pierre 2005, quoted in Richards 2012 : 3). It is written in fragments of daily action. It is written in the knowledge of the impossibility of relaying experience as it is or was. As a teller of a story, I emphasise that I do not posit my characters as objects. Rather, they are presented in this research in a relationship of trust, existing between myself and them for a period stretching beyond twelve years. Meaning cannot always be relayed in words. Suggestions of meaning can lie in the relationship between texts (Parsons 2002 : 32 in Le Roux 2012 :xi 4). AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Die navorsing behels my storie as leerondersteuner-onderwyser en omvat my identiteitswording vanaf Januarie 2001 tot Desember 2012. My benadering van aanvaarding en meelewing binne die atmosfeer van performatiwiteit, lei tot my skryfproses en word my outo-etnografiese reis. Die skryfproses bring verandering, om die performatiewe te beleef as ân aksie van doen (Giroux 2000 a: 135) en ân manier van wees, binne dag-tot-dag-situasies (in Denzin 2004 : 273). Deur die opteken van my ervaring binne wisselende ruimtes hoop ek om ân akademiese bydrae te lewer, wat die leser intrek binne belewing van my identiteitsvorming en ontvouing van die skryfproses as reis. Ek skryf my inleiding aan die einde en besef die navorsing het my storie sowel as myself verander. Ek sukkel om <b>die</b> <b>slot</b> te skryf. En besef: dis oor my storie elke dag aangaan. Ek word ân performatiewe etnograaf (Denzin 2004 : 262) en sien konkrete situasies en tree toe tot gesprek. Ek beleef verdieping van my bewussyn deur die skryfproses. My navorsing behels nie vraelyste en onderhoude nie en is aksie-navorsing, geleef in elke dag se dinge. My storie met herinnerings was daar voor die navorsing maar dis nooit vertel nie. Ball (1996) verwys na hierdie proses as identifikasie. Die proses waardeur ek gaan om gesien te word, sowel as die proses om myself te sien, lei tot ân spesifieke identiteit (aangehaal deur Thompson 2004 : 45). My storie begin oor my wonder en peins oor anderswees as wit vrou binne my konteks van twee bruin skole. Dra ek die wit scar ?(Cixous 1998). Ek ervaar die skryfproses as manier om tot kennis te kom. My navorsing lei tot vrae. En nie noodwendig tot antwoorde nie. Die skryfproses lei tot ân kyk deur ân ander lens, ân beter verstaan. Vrede. En Hoop. En ek leer hoop is ân ontologiese behoefte. Die begeerte om te droom, te verander en menselewens te verbeter (Freire 1999 : 8 in Denzin 2003 : 263).

As verteller beklemtoon ek dat ek nie my karakters as objekte voorstel nie, maar dat ek skryf binne ân etiese vertrouensverhouding wat oor twaalf jaar strek. Betekenis kan nie altyd in woorde weergegee word nie. Suggestie van betekenis kan lÈ in verhoudings tussen tekste (Parsons 2002 : 32 in Le Roux 2010 :xi 4) ...|$|R

40|$|Melt blowing is {{commonly}} used to convert polymer resin directly into nonwoven fabrics of superfine fibers. Further decrease of the fiber diameter will improve the filtration and adsorption properties remarkably and thus has been appealing to the researchers. Besides the dual <b>slot</b> <b>die,</b> the annular die is utilized to manufacture superfine fibers in the melt blowing process as well. In the dual <b>slot</b> <b>die,</b> the high velocity air flow {{from both sides of}} the polymer melt. However, the air encircles the polymer melt entirely in the annular die, which is in favor of the polymer drawing and thus manufacture of nanofibers. In this paper, the air flow field model of the annular die is established and solved numerically. The polymer drawing with the melt blowing annular die is modeled and simulated by introducing the simulation results of the air flow field. The predicted fiber diameters coincide with the experimental data. Effects of the polymer flow rate and initial air velocity on the fiber diameter are also explored. The results show good perspective of using melt blowing technology to manufacture nanofibers materials because melt blowing has a higher output than electrospinning...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Melt blowing is {{a typical}} {{nonwoven}} process for producing superfine fibers. In this process, the high velocity hot air jets attenuate the polymer melt into superfine fibers. Therefore, the fiber diameter is strongly affected by the air flow field. Dual <b>slot</b> <b>die</b> {{is one of the}} widely used melt blowing dies. Hot air emits from the two slots symmetrically. What will happen to the polymer drawing if the air jets are unsymmetrical? In this paper, the unsymmetrical air flow field of the dual <b>slot</b> <b>die</b> in melt blowing process is simulated numerically. The distributions of air velocity and air temperature are obtained. The polymer drawing model is then solved with the aid of the simulation results of air velocity and air temperature. The diameter and transverse displacement of the threadline along the spinline is achieved. The result shows that the threadline diameter of unsymmetrical air flow field is larger than that of the symmetrical air flow field and the threadline tends to deflect because of the unsymmetrical air jets. This paper helps to indicate the research direction for further decreasing the fiber diameter of melt blown nonwoven fabrics...|$|E

40|$|<b>Slot</b> <b>die</b> coating {{technology}} {{is currently the}} most widely used method for production of optical films. The main advantages of this coating method are its ability to pre-determine the product film thickness and to produce uniform film under prolonged operation. In the present study, a laboratory-scale <b>slot</b> <b>die</b> coating equipment was used to investigate the effects of pH, molecular weight and degree of hydrolysis of TiO 2 in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) suspensions on the coating window. Measurements of steady shear viscosity, surface tension, and amount of PVA adsorption on particle surfaces of different suspensions, together with observations of coating bead by means of a flow visualization technique, were used to analyze the coating flow behavior. Changing pH affected the suspension rheology and its stability. Increasing the amount of PVA adsorbed on the TiO 2 surface resulted in an increase in surface tension, which was responsible for the expansion of the coating window or an increase of the maximum coating speed at which flow defects occurred. Four different PVA with varying molecular weight and degree of hydrolysis were used in the suspensions. Higher degrees of hydrolysis resulted in an increase in polymer adsorption, and hence larger surface tension. By contrast, higher molecular weight PVA resulted in a higher viscosity and a smaller surface tension, thus causing air entrainment to occur at a much lower maximum coating speed...|$|E
40|$|Coating tensioned-web {{running over}} <b>slot</b> <b>die</b> is an {{efficient}} way of depositing thin and uniform layers on flexible web {{at high speed}} with a relatively simple set-up, a combination of <b>slot</b> <b>die</b> premetering and carefully controlled web transport. A particularly attractive feature of such tensioned-web coating is that two layers can be coated simultaneously, which {{makes it possible for}} one of the layers to be exceptionally thin, and for two layers to be created with less wastage than in tandem single layer operation. Successful two-layer coating from a two-slot die requires not only avoiding bead break-up, but also operating at conditions that fix the separation line of the interlayer zone at a proper position, which is generally the downstream corner of the mid-lip between the two feed slots; otherwise the layer becomes non-uniform [Cohen 1993, Sartor 1998] and microvortexes may be prompted in the coating bead. Whereas one-dimensional elastoviscocapillary modeling accounts well for the web profile over the die, the gap between web and die lips, and the pressure profile along the gap, full two-dimensional Navier-Stokes theory is necessary to predict separation line location on the mid-lip and occurrence of microvortexes around the feed slots and downstream meniscus. To reduce computational cost, Navier-Stokes model for that region was hybridized with successful elastoviscocapillary model for the regions upstream of the bottom layer feed slot and downstream of the top layer feed slot; i. e. the regions wer...|$|E
