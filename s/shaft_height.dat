The evolution over time of the moisture and the temperature in the ventilation network was assessed by means of numerical simulations. Condensation events are described in terms of location, frequency and flow rate. The physical con-ceptual model takes into account the heat and vapour advection and exchanges with walls, and heat conduction through the host rock. The results of simulations were analysed to highlight how the architectural design, the gradual extension of storage zones, the ventilation rate and the weather conditions are likely to influence the ambient conditions all along the shafts, the galleries and the storage modules.

Mixed convection, i. e. a heat transfer, when the contribution of free and forced convection is comparable, was created {{with the help of}} the exhaust shaft mounted above the heat exchanger bundle and forced air movement was created by the difference in density of the air in the shaft and the environment. The experimental dependence of the heat transfer of finned single row of bundles in the selected ranges of Grashof and Reynolds numbers has been determined. It is demonstrated that heat transfer in the mixed convection is 2. 5 − 3 times higher than in free one and the growth rate of heat transfer with increasing Reynolds number is more than in the forced convection. Different forms of representation of results of experiments were analyzed and it was determined that the Nusselt number has a single power dependence on the Reynolds number at any height of the exhaust shafts.

30|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the importance of an appropriate egress strategy when using evacuation elevators. Actual evacuation scenarios showed that elevators {{can be used to}} assist the evacuation of a high-rise building (Averill et al. 2005; Sekizawa et al. 1999). Unfortunately, few studies are available on the human factors associated to the use of this egress component (Heyes 2009; Kinsey 2011; Nilsson and Jönsson 2011). Current practices require a management system able to dispatch an elevator trip aimed at emptying the whole <b>shaft</b> <b>height</b> (Weismantle et al. 2007). The number of the elevator stops is another key factor to be considered. Any attempt to counteract the delay due to the increased number of floors served by the evacuation elevators is currently not considered acceptable in normal lift usage theory (Barney 2003). The main solution generally employed is to serve a maximum of approximately 15 floors with one elevator or a group of elevators (Noordermeer 2010). The concept of zoning is therefore necessary to optimize the design solution employed. The building is therefore divided into zones of a certain number of floors where elevators have been assigned. Kinsey et al. (2012) investigated the main human factors {{associated with the use of}} different lift strategies, with a particular emphasis on the under-utilisation of elevators in relation to accepted waiting times. High-rise buildings are also generally provided with shuttle elevators that are usually larger and faster, whose aim is to link sky-lobbies. The concept of “lifeboats” was proposed by Pauls (1978) in the 1970 s. He made a comparison to a ship evacuation where occupants are gathered before leaving the ship using lifeboats, i.e., a mustering approach. He suggested that occupants could initially evacuate to the sky-lobbies and then wait there for further instructions.|$|E

First, a pre-existing model of the motor is analyzed and improved. Then, different methods to improve the efficiency of the motor are investigated and the performance of the machine is studied after each modification. Thirdly, a complete optimization of the design is carried out with the goal of developing an IE 4 IM compatible with IEC standard frames. Finally, a similar optimization of the motor is performed substituting the aluminum squirrel cage by a copper one. The pros and cons of this change are studied. The results show the feasibility of reaching the IE 4 efficiency level by this type of IM with a standard <b>shaft</b> <b>height.</b> Preserving the original cross-section design of the stator, this efficiency level is only reached if a copper squirrel cage is used and if the rotor cross-section is redesigned.

40|$|In {{this study}} a thermal comfort {{ventilation}} strategy called ‘ventilation shaft’, {{which is a}} vertical shaft located {{at the rear of}} a single-sided unit and with an exhaust at the building’s flat roof, is proposed for a single-sided residential unit in high-rise buildings in Bangkok. The main aim is to investigate its potential to maximize the unit’s indoor air velocity and to extend the occupants’ thermal comfort, which, therefore, reduces high electricity consumption due to cooling systems. By using the validated CFD code in DesignBuilder simulation software, the ventilation shaft’s effectiveness was examined and its design was optimized. It was found that the proposed strategy can effectively increase the unit’s air velocity from 0. 05 ms- 1 to 1. 44 ms- 1 (approximately 36 % of the external wind speed of 4 ms- 1 under wind incident angle of 0 °). The external wind speed and direction relating to the unit’s main window were found as the most influential external parameters, while the vertical shaft’s size as well as the inlet and outlet’s size and location with respect to the occupied area were the most influential design factors to determine its performance. A <b>shaft</b> <b>height</b> of at least 1 m above the building flat roof, as well as an opening width of at least 50 %- 75 % of the wall’s width, is recommended for ensuring the best results. Openings’ length, particularly the inlet’s, only to cover the occupied level is also suggested to avoid excessive solar heat gain from the environment. Regarding thermal comfort, the ventilation shaft with its optimal design was attached to the rooms from floor 6 th to floor 25 th of the hypothetical building and found able to produce the required air speed for creating physiological cooling effect in most units. This could extend the occupants’ thermal comfort time for up to 33 % and 64 % per day for a south- and a north-facing unit in the hypothetical building, respectively based on ASHRAE’s adaptive comfort model, and could lead to significant energy savings of up to 68. 8 MW per annum and 5, 291 MW per annum for a typical residential building in Bangkok based on a typical electric ceiling fan and a split type air conditioner respectively. In conclusion, the proposed ventilation shaft is an effective windinduced strategy to increase the air velocity and create cross ventilation in a single-sided residential unit, which can enhance the natural ventilation potential to provide thermal comfort and reduce the a/c systems dependency in typical high-rise residential buildings in Bangkok and other hot-humid climates...|$|E

In 2010, there were almost 3. 1 million nonfatal and 646 fatal illnesses and injuries disclosed in the workplace (BLS, 2010). Fatal and nonfatal occupational injuries have decreased in the recent years but there is still much room to improve. Inappropriate footwear has been attributed to 45 % of all falls (Menant et al. 2008). Past studies have shown that industrial footwear can have a detrimental effect on balance (Menant et al. 2008, Chander, Garner & Wade 2013). Occupational footwear have not been designed based on foot biomechanics but based solely on physical safety. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the effect different types of occupational footwear have on dynamic balance for acute bouts of time. Thirty-one healthy adult males (aged 21. 2 ± 1. 4 years; weight 82. 6 ± 15. 4 kg; height 179 ± 9. 4 cm) with no musculoskeletal, orthopedic, neurological, cardiovascular, and vestibular abnormalities were examined. The participants were expected to come to two visit days. The first was a familiarization and lasted about ten minutes, while the second was the actual test and lasted about an hour. Dynamic balance was measured on the NeuroCom Equitest MCT (BWM, BWL, FWM, FWL). Latencies values were found to determine reaction times to the perturbations. Individuals were randomly assigned the three different types of footwear: work boot (WB) (mass 0. 39 ± 0. 06 kg), tactical boot (TB) (mass 0. 53 ± 0. 08 kg), and low-top slip-resistant shoe (LT) (mass 0. 89 ± 0. 05 kg). 1 x 4 [Testing Session x Footwear Condition (BF v. LT v. TB v. WB) ] RMANOVA was used to evaluate balance dependent variables. Post-hoc pairwise comparisons identified differences between footwear conditions. Significant differences were found in FWM and FWL translations, but post-hoc comparisons found no differences between footwear. Significant differences were also found in the BWL translations between the barefoot condition and TB and between the barefoot condition and WB. Both the TB and WB had a higher boot <b>shaft</b> <b>height</b> as well as increased latency values. Higher latency values mean a longer time to respond to perturbations, which could result in a fall or injury.

40|$|With {{a larger}} {{awareness}} of the climate changes and increasing electricity prices, energy efficiency measures in the industry have become more common. By rationalize the activity and by the same time decrease the emission of greenhouse gases the company can both save money and reduce negative environmental impact. For the Swedish industries the electricity price have traditional been relative low, which {{has resulted in a}} considerable larger usage than other European countries. By a deregulation of the European electricity market the electricity price will level off between the countries, which will cause a higher electricity price in Sweden than we are use to. To prevent that the Swedish industry don’t lose competitiveness against the other European countries, it will require energy efficiency activities in all different forms. ABB Sweden has decided to decrease their total energy usage with five percent in two years. This is one step to rationalize their activity and set a good example for other companies and customers. LV Motors is a company within the division Automation Products that fabricates Low Voltage Motors within the <b>shaft</b> <b>height</b> 112 – 280 (millimeter). This Master’s thesis is accomplished at LV Motors and {{is a part of the}} goal to decrease the total energy usage at ABB Sweden with five percent. In order to increase energy efficiency in a company it is very important that you first find the total use of energy. Thereafter when the total energy is spotted and divided in different unit processes is it likely to look at where the energy use is benefiting to examine. Since electricity is the energy form that is most common and has the highest price it’s the electric power consumption that have been studied the most. From the table above you can see that the electricity is divided almost the same between Support processes and Production processes. The Lighting is the largest unit process followed by the Heating of all the ovens. Thereafter the Ventilation and the Compressed air are the largest unit processes. With knowledge in energy efficiency measures in the industry and briefing of former studies the concentration in this work has been improvements of the Support processes. In excess of all suggested energy improvements LV Motors has a large potential to decrease their electric bills in order to cooperate with the real-estate concern and make sure that the electric bills get correctly charged. LV Motors don’t possess their own building, which brings that processes like lightning, ventilation and space heating should be included in the rent. These designs for how the electricity charges are however not totally correct. Total there is a potential to save up to 1, 6 million crowns per year in decreasing operating costs. To accomplish this it will demand relative large investments. If you’re not willing to do these investments there are still a cost-saving at 700 000 crowns per year that don’t demand any large investments, only a changed behavior at the employees. Since the electricity price in Sweden probably will further increase the next years, this results in even larger cost-savings than the calculated savings above. Besides saving money there is also a potential to save between 72 to 144 tonnes less emission of carbon dioxide per year. Making the electricity use more effective for the company will do this possible. For heat recovery will further reduction of carbon dioxides be added, but these numbers are not included here. The biggest barrier to energy effective at LV Motors is split incentives, as the company doesn’t own the buildings. The real-estate group and LV Motors must agree on who stands for the investment and who get in on the profit. If these two arguments don’t connect it is difficult to motivate the purchase of more energy effective equipment...|$|E

40|$|Internal fire whirls {{induced by}} a pool {{fire in a}} {{vertical}} <b>shaft</b> of <b>height</b> 15 m with different ventilation conditions are studied experimentally. Ventilation is provided through a rectangular gap at the side wall with varying widths. Gasoline pool fires with diameters up to 0. 46 m are set up {{at the center of}} the floor. Flame height and burning duration of the pool fire are measured. Average flame height ranged from 1 to 4. 5 m when whirling is onsetted in the vertical shaft. Experimental studies indicate that air supply to the upper part of the shaft is a key factor for onsetting internal fire whirls. Oxygen is required to sustain combustion to generate heat for inducing whirling motions. Therefore, flame will not whirl without adequate oxygen supply. In this study, the flaming zone in a vertical shaft is divided into four stages: the initial stage, flame rising-up stage, stable flame, whirling stage and decay stage. Based on the flame height correlations for free burning pool fires, the fuel consumption rate of the pool fire in the shaft at each stage is estimated. Correlations of the whirling flame height with fuel mass and other key parameters are then derived.

In comparison with the tests, the validity of the calculation method was verified. It was found that the results of calculation were good agreement with the tests’. In addition, several factors which affect the deflection of the crankshaft were analyzed with the FEM, and the influences of flange <b>height,</b> <b>shaft</b> diameter, mechanical air gap in the motor, rotor weight on the deflection were found distinctly, which as a primary theoretical basis is provided for the compressor design...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissolved}} air flotation process is used in water and wastewater treatment. Among many parameters the fluid dynamics determine {{the capacity of the}} process. The contact zone is assumed to be important for the removal function, as it {{is believed to be the}} location for the aggregation of bubbles and flocs. This paper presents an experimental study on the flow structure in a contact zone of a DAF pilot tank and the influence of contact zone configuration. The flow structure in the contact zone was examined for different horizontal lengths of the zone and for different heights and inclinations of the shaft wall. The hydraulic surface loading was 11 m/h over the total tank surface area and the recycle rate was constant at 10 % of the main flow. The examined hydraulic surface loading over the contact zone ranged from 40 to 98 m/h. Water velocities in the longitudinal, central section of the tank were measured with an acoustical Doppler velocimeter in a grid net for the different contact zone configurations, giving an insight into the flow structure. The result showed that the flow structure in the contact zone was characterised by a turbulent lower region and a plug-flow higher region. The hydraulic surface loading, a function of the length of the contact zone, seemingly determined the extension of the turbulent region. A higher hydraulic surface loading decreased the turbulent region while the lower loading increased it. A hydraulic surface loading of 65 m/h was suggested for design. It was not possible to determine the turbulent intensity quantitatively due to the measurement method. The height and inclination of the shaft wall did not seem to have a significant influence on the turbulent region. However, an increased height of the contact zone enhanced the higher, plug flow region and a recommended height of 0. 81 m or higher for the recommended hydraulic surface loading was suggested when both mixing and plug-flow are desired. The separation zone was characterised by a stratified flow structure, mainly influenced by the cross-flow velocity that is a function of the distance between the shaft wall top and the water surface. A cross-flow velocity of 37 m/h or higher resulted in a clearly defined stratification, believed to be crucial for an efficient separation of flocs. Finally, the extension of the lower, denser plug-flow region in the separation zone increased when the <b>shaft</b> wall <b>height</b> increased...|$|R
60|$|The {{proportioning}} of {{the columns}} and {{walls of the}} lower story is so lovely and so varied, that it would need pages of description {{before it could be}} fully understood; but it may be generally stated thus: The height of the lower shafts, upper shafts, and wall, being severally expressed by a, b, and c, then a:c::c:b (a being the highest); and the diameter of shaft b is generally to the diameter of <b>shaft</b> a as <b>height</b> b is to height a, or something less, allowing for the large plinth which diminishes the apparent height of the upper shaft: and when this is their proportion of width, one shaft above is put above one below, with sometimes another upper shaft interposed: but in the extreme arches a single under shaft bears two upper, proportioned as truly as the boughs of a tree; that is to say, the diameter of each upper = 2/3 of lower. There being thus the three terms of proportion gained in the lower story, the upper, while it is only divided into two main members, in order that the whole height may not be divided into an even number, has the third term added in its pinnacles. So far of the vertical division. The lateral is still more subtle. There are seven arches in the lower story; and, calling the central arch a, and counting to the extremity, they diminish in the alternate order a, c, b, d. The upper story has five arches, and two added pinnacles; and these diminish in regular order, the central being the largest, and the outermost the least. Hence, while one proportion ascends, another descends, like parts in music; and yet the pyramidal form is secured for the whole, and, which was another great point of attention, none of the shafts of the upper arches stand over those of the lower.|$|R
