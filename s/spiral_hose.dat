2500|$|Plastic Slinkys {{are also}} available. They {{can be made}} in {{different}} colors. Many of them are made with the colors of the rainbow in rainbow order. They were marketed in the 1970s as a safer alternative to metal slinkys as they did not present a hazard when inserted into electrical sockets. The plastic spring toy, known as the Plastic Slinky was invented by Donald James Reum Sr. of Master Mark Plastics in Albany, Minnesota. Reum {{came up with the idea}} as he was playing with different techniques to produce a <b>spiral</b> <b>hose</b> for watering plants. [...] However, as it came off the assembly line, according to his children, it looked more like a [...] "Slinky." [...] He worked at it until it came out perfectly and then went to Betty James with his prototype. Reum manufactured the Plastic Slinky for Betty James for several years. [...] Eventually Betty James [...] decided to manufacture the product exclusively through James manufacturing, effectively ending the production of the toy by the small Minnesota company. Reum’s patent number, 4120929 was filed on Dec 28, 1976 and issued by the US Patent Office on Oct 17, 1978.|$|E
60|$|And she was mad {{with desire}} of him. She {{could not see}} him without {{touching}} him. In the factory, as he talked to her about <b>Spiral</b> <b>hose,</b> she ran her hand secretly along his side. She followed him out into the basement for a quick kiss; her eyes, always mute and yearning, full of unrestrained passion, she kept fixed on his. He was afraid of her, lest she should too flagrantly give herself away before the other girls. She invariably waited for him at dinnertime for him to embrace her before she went. He {{felt as if she}} were helpless, almost a burden to him, and it irritated him.|$|E

40|$|The {{commonly}} known natural dye substance processing for traditional clothes, such as batik and tenun (woven cloth) is fermentation. The fermentation process can specifically be continued with extraction to produce indigo paste. The {{process can be}} done mechanically, i. e. by stirring process, and chemically. In order to accelerate the production, manual process of aeration can be substituted with jet-spray aerator. The aerator prototype which has been developed is acrylic aerator tube with diameter of 240 mm and thickness of 5 mm. The tube was made 1 m long to provide with a sufficient space for indigo foam. Its bottom part is completed with <b>spiral</b> air <b>hose</b> having five small holes of 0. 2, 0. 4, and 0. 6 mm diameter uniformly located along the height of solution in the tube. The aerator was designed for the 10 litters of fermentation solution of 1 kilogram indigofera leaves. Based on the mass of indigo paste produced, the optimum working condition of the aerator is achieved on 3. 8 m/sec air velocity and supply pressure of 2 bar with duration of 60 minutes. The aeration test indicated operational characteristic was quite good, i. e. Oxygen Transfer Rate (OTR) of 3. 6 kg/hour, Aeration Efficiency (AE) of 4. 8 kg/kWh and factual Oxygen Transfer Efficiency (OTE) of 44 %...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} milk {{pasteurization}} generally use thermal method. The method can cause microorganisms inactive {{on the other}} side, the method result in the degradation of quality food. An alternative method {{that can be used}} is by using technology of ultraviolet irradiation. Ultraviolet light has short wavelength with a very strong antimicrobacterialenergy. The mechanism of its wor is by absorbing the energy by nucleid acid without causing damaged on the surface of cel. The absorbed energy will cause the bonding of tymine (dimer tymine) so that the function of nucleic acid is disturbed and it cause the dead of microorganism (Lay and of Hastowo, 1992). The devices used in this research are ultraviolet lamp type C, <b>spiral</b> <b>hose,</b> supporting frame, materials containers and the devices for measuring the amount of microbes, fat, specific gravity and colour. Materials used in this research is fresh milk that obtained from KUD DAU Malang. The result are pasteurization process with UV irradiation decrease microorganisms and fat in milk...|$|E
40|$|Two static {{mathematical}} {{models of}} the open or Dungey model of the magnetosphere are constructed. The process of construction {{is similar to that}} for early closed magnetosphere models, such as the Taylor-Hones model. The first model in fact is simply an addition of an interplanetary field in arbitrary direction to a Taylor-Hones image dipole model. In order to preserve the shape of the magnetosphere at high latitudes, and to partially exclude the exterior field, another model is constructed with the magnetopause approximated by a diamagnetic sphere. We find that there are some interplanetary field lines connected to the earth for all orientations of the interplanetary field other than strictly northward, and that the maximum number of connected field lines occurs with a due southward field. For an average <b>spiral</b> <b>hose</b> angle of the interplanetary field, the dayside neutral point occurs on the magnetopause at about 10 o'clock local time. Dayside auroras, convection patterns, and other phenomena may exhibit symmetry about this local time. For a positive (negative) interplanetary field sector, energetic, anisotropic particle fluxes should have direct access to the northern (southern) polar caps, as is supported by many recent observations...|$|E
