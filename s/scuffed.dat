40|$|Some typical {{applications}} where <b>scuffing</b> {{may occur}} are gear teeth, piston rings and cylinder pairs, cams and followers, splines, sleeve bearings, {{and parts of}} swash and wobble plate compressors. Unlike other tribology-related failures, <b>scuffing</b> occurs very fast, without any warning, and usually leads to the complete destruction of the sliding pair. Practical experience with steel has helped to outline safe ranges of operation for some components. Very little, however, is known about aluminum, which {{is the second most}} commonly used engineering metal. The aim {{of this study is to}} obtain a better understanding <b>scuffing</b> and seizure of aluminum/steel contacts. The research includes an experimental study of <b>scuffing</b> of aluminum/steel contacts under dry sliding conditions, a study of the physics of the <b>scuffing</b> process, evaluation of various hypotheses for scuffmg, and modeling of <b>scuffing.</b> The experiments are conducted in a custom-designed tribometer, which provides accurate control of the environmental conditions. Special instrumentation, experimental procedures and software are developed as a part of the experimental program. These provide a reliable reproduction and identification of <b>scuffing</b> under laboratory conditions. The <b>scuffing</b> characteristics of five materials are obtained in air and refrigerant (R 134 a) environments. The effects of load, sliding velocity, mechanical strength, environmental temperature, specimen geometry, time, loading history, and type of environment are evaluated. The mechanisms leading to <b>scuffing</b> are studied by examination of surfaces, subsurfaces and wear debris of specimens in the process of <b>scuffing.</b> Quantitative measurements of subsurface plastic strain are also obtained. The theoretical part of the study includes the development of a finite element model for the contact of runned-in rough surfaces and several other models for subsurface stresses, temperatures, and strains. These models provide information about the local conditions in the subsurface Based on the experimental observations and the <b>scuffing</b> models a new hypothesis for <b>scuffing</b> is proposed. According to this hypothesis, <b>scuffing</b> involves initiation of cracks due to subsurface plastic deformation, propagation of these cracks leading to the removal of the existing protective surface layers, and finally cold welding due to adhesion between bare metal surfaces.

The home side's first goal came minutes before half-time, when Daniele Massaro's defensive-splitting pass found Boban, who scored, despite Schwarz's attempts to hold him back by tugging his shirt. The Croatian forward nearly scored a second, but for Seaman's quick intervention. Up until then, Arsenal had briefly threatened; from a long ball in the 19th minute, Hartson managed to turn Franco Baresi, but <b>scuffed</b> his shot wide. Milan found it easy to contain the opposition, given Desailly and Savićević influenced the tempo of the match. The latter came close to doubling Milan's lead when he broke forward and hit a shot goalwards, only for Seaman to divert the ball round the post. In the second half, Wright thought he had equalised for Arsenal when he tapped the ball in, but the referee disallowed the goal as there was infringement in the build-up. Milan continued to attack and extended their lead soon after; from Savićević's corner, Massaro jumped higher than his marker Lee Dixon and headed the ball into the Arsenal goal.

40|$|<b>Scuffing</b> {{is defined}} in the {{literature}} as “gross damage characterized by the formation of local welds between the sliding surfaces ” [1]. This localized damage suddenly appears when the frictional heat generated at the contact induces a critical temperature increase. Numerous studies were conducted {{in order to establish}} a <b>scuffing</b> criterion. Some of them focus on the power dissipation inside the contact (product of the sliding speed and the load) [2] some others compare the minimum film thickness of lubricant separating the surfaces to the surface roughness [3, 4]. In 1937 Blok introduced a thermal <b>scuffing</b> criterion [5]: each combination of base-stock lubricant and material has a characteristic <b>scuffing</b> temperature.

40|$|<b>Scuffing</b> {{that occurs}} at {{tribological}} contacts in mechanical components, brings about topographical, chemical, and mechanical changes mainly at the sub-micron surface. In this project, extensive studies involving {{the use of}} various engineering and scientific tools were performed {{to better understand the}} exact mechanisms behind this phenomenon. A High Pressure Tribometer (HPT) was used to simulate shoe-on-disk tribological contacts under various conditions as encountered in compressor surfaces. Specifically, Al 390 -T 6 disk/ 52100 steel pin tribo-pairs are representative of typical contacting surfaces used in swash plate-type air-conditioning compressors. Once the time to <b>scuff</b> a sample under the test protocol was determined, subsequent HPT tests were stopped at 0. 25 x <b>Scuffing</b> Time, 0. 50 x <b>Scuffing</b> Time, and 0. 75 x <b>Scuffing</b> Time intervals. The progressive change in disk topography leading up to <b>scuffing</b> was first observed in the 1 -D roughness study [1], but more extensively captured by the 2 -D Birmingham- 14 roughness characterization that is also described in this report [2]. When the chemical analyses were conducted on the uppermost surfaces for depths of 120 nm, significant changes in some of the major chemical element concentration were revealed at <b>scuffing.</b> The major chemical compositional changes include a depletion of silicon, which was used to strengthen the aluminum alloy, and a drastic increase of oxygen component, signaling heavy oxidation at <b>scuffing</b> [1]. The mechanical properties of the disks undergoing tribological evolution were also investigated through various experimental hardness measurements, ranging from macro- to micro-, and to nanoscales [3]. Based on the experimental hardness results, {{it was found that the}} hardness of the material becomes higher at the micro- and sub-micro scales than the bulk, regardless of the amount of wear towards <b>scuffing.</b> It was also observed that there was a gradual weakening of the uppermost 60 nm. In this report, we describe in detail the surface roughness changes that occur to the Al 390 -T 6 samples as they undergo progressively longer tribological testing, eventually leading to <b>scuffing.</b> [1] Patel, J.

25|$|Another {{difference}} between the two sports involves the condition of the ball as a match progresses. In cricket, if a ball is hit into the stands, the spectators must return it to the field. Also, a ball that is <b>scuffed</b> or scratched will continue in use; a ball must be used for a minimum number of overs (currently 80 in Test cricket and 25 in One-Day-International cricket with a different ball being used from each end) before it can be replaced. If a ball is damaged, lost, or illegally modified, it is replaced by a used ball of similar condition to the old one. Finally, cricketers are allowed sparingly to modify the ball, though this is highly restricted. The ball may be polished (usually on a player's uniform) without the use of an artificial substance, may be dried with a towel if it is wet, and may have mud removed from it under supervision; all other actions which alter the condition of the ball are illegal. In Major League Baseball (MLB), a ball that is hit into the stands is never returned to play and spectators are free to keep any balls that come into their possession (although local tradition may provide for a ball to be thrown back, specifically in the case of home-run balls hit against the Chicago Cubs when playing at Wrigley Field).|$|E

In this study, the frictional forces, wear amounts and cycles to <b>scuffing</b> in boundary lubricated sliding condition were measured using the reciprocating wear tester. The cylinder blocks with several values of surface roughness were used as reciprocating specimens, {{and a piece of}} piston ring was used as fixed pin. As increasing load by several steps in lubricated sliding, the friction signals indicated the state of surface interactions, such as friction forces, changes of lubricating films and <b>scuffing.</b> There were some rapid increases in friction forces just before the <b>scuffing</b> would occur. It was found that there was the optimum value of initial surface roughness to prolong the wear life of sliding surfaces.
