5|$|Homosexual arousal in {{childhood}} appeared to predict adult homosexuality, while homosexual activities and arousal during adolescence {{had a very}} strong connection with adult homosexuality. Rape and sexual molestation {{did not appear to be}} significant in the development of homosexuality. Heterosexual arousal during childhood had a very small effect on adult <b>sexual</b> <b>preference.</b> Homosexual women were more likely to have their first homosexual encounter before their first heterosexual encounter. Phenomena associated with physical maturation, such as the age at which menstruation began, did not appear to play a significant role in the development of <b>sexual</b> <b>preference,</b> while parental attitudes toward sex and failure to enjoy early heterosexual activity also seemed unimportant. Sexual feelings seemed important in the development of adult homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, <b>Sexual</b> <b>Preference</b> {{received}} a mixed review from George Smith in The Body Politic, {{and was also}} reviewed by Robert Herron in Christopher Street. The following year, it was reviewed by Doug Futuym and Richard Wagner in The Advocate.|$|E

40|$|A novel general {{explanation}} of the evolutionary process leading to the appearance of differences insexual preferences is proposed. The explanation is fully general: it is not specific to any particular type of <b>sexual</b> <b>preferences,</b> nor to any species orpopulation. It shows how different <b>sexual</b> <b>preferences</b> can appear in any large group-living population in which sexual selection is sufficiently strong in each sex. The main {{idea is that the}} lack of interest towards a member of the opposite sex may be interpreted as a signal of popularity, and thus a sign of reproductive success. It is then boosted by the Fisher runaway process, resulting in a generalized trait~ [...] - lack of interest towards the opposite sex. This trait develops far beyond the point when it gives a reproductive disadvantage, resulting in well-pronounced different <b>sexual</b> <b>preferences.</b> This hypothesis is placed into the context of other works on different <b>sexual</b> <b>preferences</b> in animals; supporting evidence from the literature is reviewed and additional research needed to confirm or refute the hypothesis in any given species is outlined...|$|R

5|$|Homosexual men {{tended to}} have had their first {{homosexual}} encounter at a younger age, {{and were more likely}} to have their first encounters with friends or acquaintances rather than strangers. The data did not support the idea that homosexual males are likely to have been seduced by older men. Homosexual activity involving genital contact in childhood was connected to adult homosexuality, though only weakly; homosexual arousal during childhood or adolescence was a stronger predictor of adult homosexuality. Heterosexual arousal during childhood was a moderate predictor of adult heterosexuality. Phenomena associated with sexual maturation, such as the age of first ejaculation, did not seem to be important, and neither did parental attitudes toward sex. Respondents' opportunities to engage in sex with persons of the opposite or the same sex did not seem to be an important influence on the <b>sexual</b> <b>preference</b> they developed, and sexual experiences with persons of both the same and the opposite sex were common among both homosexuals and heterosexuals. Sexual feelings appeared to be more important than sexual behavior as an indicator of adult <b>sexual</b> <b>preference.</b>|$|E
5|$|Seen {{as likely}} to provoke {{controversy}} even before its publication, <b>Sexual</b> <b>Preference</b> received considerable media attention, and reviews that were mainly mixed or negative. Critics questioned Bell et al.′s reliance upon a statistical technique, originally developed {{for use in the}} biological sciences, called path analysis, disputed the representativeness of their sample of homosexuals, pointed out the difficulty and potential unreliability of adult recall of childhood feeling and the vague and general nature of the questions respondents were asked, and disagreed with Bell et al.′s suggestion that sexual orientation is innate. Nevertheless, some reviewers complimented <b>Sexual</b> <b>Preference</b> for its authors' challenge to established views about the causes of homosexuality, and it eventually came to be considered a classic work. It {{is one of the most}} frequently cited retrospective studies relating to sexual orientation, credited by psychologists with disproving psychoanalytic theories about the development of homosexuality. In 2009, the American Psychological Association credited Bell et al. with helping to discredit theories attributing sexual orientation to family dynamics or trauma.|$|E
5|$|Since {{then the}} role that {{telecommunications}} has played in social relations has become increasingly important. In recent years, the popularity of social networking sites has increased dramatically. These sites allow users {{to communicate with each}} other as well as post photographs, events and profiles for others to see. The profiles can list a person's age, interests, <b>sexual</b> <b>preference</b> and relationship status. In this way, these sites can play important role in everything from organising social engagements to courtship.|$|E

5|$|In 1981, <b>Sexual</b> <b>Preference</b> {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} the historian Paul Robinson in Psychology Today and Richard P. Halgin in Library Journal, a negative review from the sociologist John Gagnon in The New York Times, a notice in Newsweek, and a discussion in The Chronicle of Higher Education, {{which focused on}} the controversy surrounding the book. The following year, it received a negative review from Michael Ignatieff in the London Review of Books. Reviewers faulted the work on grounds such as the questionable representativeness of its sample of homosexuals, though those who reviewed it positively praised it for reasons including the sophistication of its path analysis.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, <b>Sexual</b> <b>Preference</b> {{received}} negative {{reviews from}} the psychologist Clarence Tripp in the Journal of Sex Research and the sociologist Ira Reiss in Contemporary Sociology, mixed reviews from the sociologist John DeLamater in Science and the sex researcher James D. Weinrich in The Quarterly Review of Biology, {{and a positive}} review from J. Kenneth Davidson, Sr. in the Journal of Marriage and Family. Criticisms made of the work included that its authors' conclusions were based on an unrepresentative or dubiously representative sample of homosexuals, and that their reliance on path analysis and adult recall of early childhood feeling was problematic.|$|E
25|$|New epi-marks {{are usually}} {{produced}} with each generation, but these marks sometimes carry over between generations. Sex-specific epi-marks are produced in early fetal development that protect each sex {{from the natural}} disparity in testosterone that occurs during later stages of fetal development. Different epi-marks protect different sex-specific traits from being masculinized or feminized—some affect the genitals, others affect sexual identity, and yet others affect <b>sexual</b> <b>preference.</b> However, when these epi-marks are transmitted across generations from fathers to daughters or mothers to sons, they may cause reversed effects, such as the feminization of some traits in sons and similarly a partial masculinization of daughters. Furthermore, the reversed effects of feminization and masculinization {{can lead to a}} reversed <b>sexual</b> <b>preference.</b> For example, sex-specific epi-marks normally prevent female fetuses from being masculinized through exposure of atypically high testosterone, and vice versa for male fetuses. Sex-specific epi-marks that are normally erased and not passed between generations, can lead to an altered <b>sexual</b> <b>preference</b> when they escape erasure and are transferred from a father's genes to a daughter or from a mother's genes to a son. Epi-marks normally protect parents from variation in sex hormone levels during fetal development, but can carry over across generations and subsequently lead to homosexuality in opposite-sex offspring. This demonstrates that gene coding for these epi-marks can spread in the population because they benefit the development and fitness of the parent but only rarely escape erasure, leading to mismatched <b>sexual</b> <b>preference</b> in offspring.|$|E
40|$|We trained {{chickens}} {{to react}} to an average human female face but not to an average male face (or vice-versa). In a subsequent test, the animals showed preferences for faces consistent with human <b>sexual</b> <b>preferences</b> (obtained from university students). This suggests that human preferences arise from general properties of nervous systems, rather than from face-specific adaptations. We discuss this result {{in the light of}} current debate on the meaning of sexual signals, and suggest further tests of existing hypotheses about the origin of <b>sexual</b> <b>preferences...</b>|$|R

25|$|Alan P. Bell, Martin S. Weinberg, and Sue Kiefer Hammersmith, {{writing in}} <b>Sexual</b> <b>Preference</b> (1981), {{reported}} that <b>sexual</b> <b>preference</b> {{was much less}} strongly connected with pre-adult sexual feelings among bisexuals than it was among heterosexuals and homosexuals. Based on this and other findings, they suggested that bisexuality is more influenced by social and sexual learning than is exclusive homosexuality. Letitia Anne Peplau et al. wrote that while Bell et al.′s view that biological factors may be more influential on homosexuality than on bisexuality might seem plausible, {{it has not been}} directly tested and appears to conflict with available evidence, such as that concerning prenatal hormone exposure.|$|E
25|$|The Republican Party {{opposed the}} {{inclusion}} of <b>sexual</b> <b>preference</b> in anti-discrimination statutes from 1992 to 2004. The 2008 and 2012 Republican Party platform supported anti-discrimination statues based on sex, race, age, religion, creed, disability, or national origin, but both platforms were silent on sexual orientation and gender identity.|$|E
25|$|Homoerotic {{behaviour}} {{differs from}} homosexuality (see below) {{in that it}} is purely same-sex sexual behaviour that occurs for pleasure, whereas homosexuality is the sexual orientation or enduring <b>sexual</b> <b>preference</b> for the same-sex. Due to its universality, history and perceived functions it has been theorised that homoerotic behaviour has origins in evolution.|$|E

25|$|The {{preferred}} {{skin tone}} varies by culture and has varied over time. A number of indigenous African groups, {{such as the}} Maasai, associated pale skin with being cursed or caused by evil spirits associated with witchcraft.

25|$|Pedophilia emerges {{before or}} during puberty, and is stable over time. It is self-discovered, not chosen. For these reasons, pedophilia has been {{described}} as a disorder of <b>sexual</b> <b>preference,</b> phenomenologically similar to a heterosexual or homosexual sexual orientation. These observations, however, do not exclude pedophilia from the group of mental disorders because pedophilic acts cause harm, and mental health professionals can sometimes help pedophiles to refrain from harming children.|$|E
25|$|In {{non-human}} primates, {{it may be}} that testosterone in puberty stimulates sexual arousal, {{which allows}} the primate to increasingly seek out sexual experiences with females and thus creates a <b>sexual</b> <b>preference</b> for females. Some research has also indicated that if testosterone is eliminated in an adult male human or other adult male primate's system, its sexual motivation decreases, but there is no corresponding decrease in ability to engage in sexual activity (mounting, ejaculating, etc.).|$|E

25|$|Pedophilia is termed pedophilic {{disorder}} in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), and the manual defines it as a paraphilia involving intense and recurrent sexual urges towards and fantasies about prepubescent children that have either been acted upon or which cause {{the person with}} the attraction distress or interpersonal difficulty. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) defines it as a <b>sexual</b> <b>preference</b> for children of prepubertal or early pubertal age.|$|E
25|$|Pharmacological {{interventions}} {{are used to}} lower the sex drive in general, which can ease the management of pedophilic feelings, but does not change <b>sexual</b> <b>preference.</b> Antiandrogens work by interfering with the activity of testosterone. Cyproterone acetate (Androcur) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera) are the most commonly used. The efficacy of antiantrogens has some support, but few high-quality studies exist. Cyproterone acetate has the strongest evidence for reducing sexual arousal, while findings on medroxyprogesterone acetate have been mixed.|$|E
25|$|The term {{bisexuality}} {{is mainly}} {{used in the}} context of human attraction to denote romantic or sexual feelings toward both men and women, and the concept is one of the three main classifications of sexual orientation along with heterosexuality and homosexuality, all of which exist on the heterosexual–homosexual continuum. A bisexual identity does not necessarily equate to equal sexual attraction to both sexes; commonly, people who have a distinct but not exclusive <b>sexual</b> <b>preference</b> for one sex over the other also identify themselves as bisexual.|$|E
