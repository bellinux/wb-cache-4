40|$|The present paper {{reports the}} results of some spray {{application}} trials carried out in a greenhouse with full developed tomato plants to assess foliar deposition, ground losses, and dermal operator exposure when using handheld high pressure <b>spray</b> <b>lances</b> and when walking backwards during treatments. Two <b>spray</b> <b>lance</b> types (conventional with one nozzle and Yamaho C- 6 with two steel nozzles, each with two orifices) and two working pressures (10 and 20 bar) were taken into consideration. An experimental design with two factors (<b>spray</b> <b>lance</b> and pressure) was adopted, arranged according to a randomised block design with three replicates. Volume application rates ranged from 775 up to 1252 L/ha, but all data were normalised to 1000 L/ha. The results showed {{no statistically significant differences}} in the mean foliar deposition between the two <b>spray</b> <b>lances</b> and the two working pressures. However, the higher pressure improved significantly the deposit into the internal layer of the canopy (+ 57 %), whereas the Yamaho C- 6 <b>spray</b> <b>lance</b> produced a higher deposit on the external layer at any pressure. The greatest differences between external and internal layer were mainly concentrated in the middle and high parts of the canopy, where there were 55 007 _Cerruto(557) _ 49 18 - 11 - 2009 11 : 59 Pagina 55 the highest values of LAI and number of foliar layers. The fraction of the applied volume rate on the ground was on average 25 percent and it was affected only by the pressure value: it increased from 21. 7 to 28. 7 percent when the pressure increased from 10 to 20 bar, due mainly to the contribution of the conventional <b>spray</b> <b>lance</b> under the <b>sprayed</b> twin-rows. Finally, neither pressure nor <b>spray</b> <b>lance</b> type affected significantly the dermal operator exposure. Upper limbs accounted for 51 percent of the total exposure, while trunk and lower limbs accounted for 24 percent each. The body parts more exposed were the left arm and the hands, but also relatively high was the deposit on the respirator, so operators should ever wear appropriate personal protective equipment...|$|R
50|$|Most tanks {{include an}} {{automatic}} cleaning system. Using {{hot and cold}} water, an acid and/or alkaline cleaning fluid, a pump and a <b>spray</b> <b>lance</b> will clean the inner tank, ensuring an hygienic inner environment each time the tank is emptied.|$|R
40|$|Health risks {{during high}} {{pressure}} cleaning {{with a traditional}} cleaner are caused by muscle activity and exposure to vibrations. Exposure to vibrations during cleaning declines when a straight <b>spraying</b> <b>lance</b> is used instead of a bowed <b>spraying</b> <b>lance.</b> An accumulator and a better-balanced rotating nozzle further reduce vibrations. A broad-spraying nozzle hardly vibrates, but its cleaning capacity is insufficient for very dirty areas. Muscle activity can be reduced by using a fingertip handle and a straight <b>spraying</b> <b>lance.</b> The best high pressure cleaning equipment in this study had an accumulator, fingertip handle, straight <b>spraying</b> <b>lance</b> and a better-balanced rotating nozzle. For well soaked farrowing rooms or nursery rooms a broad nozzle can be used. For farms with 300 sows and 2160 finishers annual costs for robot cleaning were ¿ 1170 higher than for manual cleaning. A cleaning robot might be profitable for farms with more than 6750 finishing pigs. However: many assumptions had to be made, since several variables were unknown. Other benefits of robot cleaning are: less unpleasant work and health risks, easier labour organization and better image on the labour-market. Cleanability is affected by layout of the buildings and pens, food composition, feeding regime and material choice. Concrete floors and walls must be smooth. Coatings can make them smoother and keep them smoother, as they protect them against chemical and physical influences. It is easier to clean stainless steel than to clean galvanized metal. Surfaces must be flat and accessible for the water jet. Walls must be solid, without bars or pipes, and round pipes {{are more difficult to}} clean than diamond-shaped pipes. Seams or crack must be avoided or repaired. The cleanability of many components in the pens or in the stable would improve if swing-back constructions were applied...|$|R

40|$|Drift of {{pesticides}} {{is a critical}} element in achieving the plant protection management. As a phenomenon influenced by multiple factors {{is likely to be}} reduced, but not totally eliminated. Actually in Province of Trento most growers who sprays next to drift sensitive areas (houses, roads, bicycle patches, etc.) use mainly <b>spray</b> <b>lances.</b> To mitigate drift many other technologies are available along with several techniques. On the other hand the differences between training and pruning systems, planting distances, cultivation environments, etc., must be taken into consideration to achieve the highest level of reduction. The main characteristics of the rural landscape of Trentino are: strict connection with inhabited areas, medium or steep slope of most apple plots and intensive orchard growing with height of trees up to four meters. Comparative tests have been carried out in 2009 during different wind conditions (almost total absence and presence of wind) to verify the mitigation ability of anti-drift nozzles, used with different sprayer adjustments and coupled with other devices. Due to the instability of wind conditions during treatments, as to ensure the maximum level of drift reduction, other technical solutions were tested in 2011 and resulted adoptable together with the devices already tested...|$|R
40|$|Flemish {{greenhouse}} growers predominantly use handheld {{spray guns}} and <b>spray</b> <b>lances</b> for their crop protection purposes, despite the heavy workload and {{high risk for}} operator exposure associated with these techniques. These spray application techniques have shown to be less effective than spray boom equipment under many conditions. Handheld spraying techniques are less expensive, however, and they are more flexible in use. Many Flemish growers also erroneously believe that high spray volumes and pressures are needed to assure good plant protection. This paper summarises {{the results of a}} whole series of laboratory trials to optimize the depositions of a horizontal spray boom system in a dense ivy crop with a horizontal leaf position. The effect of nozzle type, spray volume, spray direction, air support and the number of passes was evaluated. In total, seventeen spray application techniques were evaluated. Overall, the use of air support resulted in the most uniform spray distribution because of an improved spray penetration and a good coverage of the lower sides of the leaves. The use of air support was most effective when combined with a medium droplet size extended range flat-fan nozzle at 3. 0 bar with a 30 ° forward or a standard 0 ° spray angle and a spray volume of 1000 L ha- 1. Without air support, a 30 ° forward angle lead to higher depositions within the canopy as well...|$|R
40|$|Efficiency of {{different}} <b>spraying</b> <b>lances</b> and <b>spraying</b> volumes {{on the control}} of Brevipalpus phoenicis in coffee crops. The mite Brevipalpus phoenicis is found on coffee plantations in Brazil since the 1950 's. Responsible for indirect losses due to its role as vector of a virus disease, this mite species often requires control measures, the most common based on mitecide spraying. It was evaluated the mortality of B. phoenicis due the coverage of spraying liquid applied on coffee plants, with two types of lances used in air assisted sprayers and four spraying. volumes. Treatments were applied with mitecide abamectin (Vertimec 18 CE (R) at 0. 4 L per hectare), in volumes of 250, 400, 550 and 700 L per hectare, with two types of lances for the nozzles. The control efficiency against B. phoenicis, deposition and coverage by spray liquid on coffee plants was evaluated. Experimental delineation was in randomized blocks, with eight treatments plus a check plot in four replications. The statistical analysis was carried in a factorial scheme 2 x 4 + 1. No {{significant differences in the}} number of mites were found between treatments. As regards spraying liquid deposition, it was observed an increment with increasing spraying volumes, with the plant tops showing the best deposition of spraying liquid. The duplication of the lances (nozzle branches) resulted in a significant increase in control efficiency for B. phoenicis compared with conventional branch and with check plot, without dependence of spraying volume...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{reports the}} results of some spray {{application}} trials carried out in two tomato greenhouses to assess foliar deposition, ground losses, and dermal operator exposure when using hand-held highpressure <b>spray</b> <b>lances.</b> Two operating ways (forward vs. backwards operator movement) and two different plant vegetative stages (pre-production vs. full development) were taken into consideration. An experimental design with one factor (the operator walking direction) was adopted, arranged according to a randomised block design with three replicates. Volume application rates were settled according to the plant development: 900 L/ha in pre-production stage and 1800 L/ha at full development stage. The results showed {{no statistically significant differences}} in the mean foliar deposition between the two walking directions in both development stages. The greatest differences among the sampling locations were observed in pre-production stage, when, due to the spraying technique (spray jet directed from top to bottom), the foliar deposits in the low part of the canopy were much lower than those in the middle and high part. Also ground losses were unaffected by walking direction: they ranged on average from 14. 3 % to 23. 5 % of the applied volume rate. Finally, the dermal operator exposure was greatly affected by walking direction: at full development stage, it was 8 times higher walking forward than walking backwards. So, this simple change in field practice can noticeably improve the operator safety, without penalising working capacity and quality of deposition...|$|R
5000|$|Heating can be {{achieved}} by using several methods, but the most commonly used ones are ‘’induction heating’’ or ‘’oven heating’’. The steel part is passed through a high frequency alternating current magnetic field, which heats the metal part to the required FBE coating application temperature. Typical application temperature for a stand alone FBE is 225° to 245°C. When used as a primer in a multi-layer polyolifine system, application temperature may be dropped based on FBE manufacturer's recommendations, {{in order to meet the}} [...] "inter-coat adhesion" [...] parameters. Special grade FBE coatings which can be applied at temperatures as low as 175 °C has been developed recently by certain FBE powder manufacturers. Other methods of heating are ‘’oven heating’’, ‘’infra-red heating’’, etc. The FBE powder is placed on a “fluidization bed”. In a fluidization bed, the powder particles are suspended in a stream of air, in which the powder will “behave” like a fluid. Once the air supply is turned off, the powder will remain in its original form. The fluidized powder is sprayed onto the hot substrate using suitable spray guns. An electrostatic spray gun incorporates an ionizer electrode on it, which gives the powder particles a positive electric charge. The steel to be coated is “grounded” through the conveyor. The charged powder particles uniformly wraps around the substrate, and melts into a liquid form. Internal surfaces of pipes are coated using <b>spraying</b> <b>lances,</b> which travel from one end to the other end of the heated pipe at a uniform speed, while the pipe is being rotated in its longitudinal axis.|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this report was done in order to design a pressurized test facility for droplet analysis with a laser measurement technique, Phase Doppler Anemometry. The test facility was a development work within Chemrec's pressurized black liquor gasification (BLG) project. BLG is a complex process where black liquor is atomized and sprayed into a reactor and gasified using pure oxygen. In the process {{it is crucial that}} all organic material is consumed to produce combustible gases using three stages of conversion: drying, pyrolysis and char gasification. In the end of the conversion, only an inorganic smelt is supposed to remain (ideally). For the gasification process, {{it is important to be}} fully aware of the spray characteristics created by the nozzle that yields an ideal conversion. Therefore a pressurized spray test facility with optical access windows for measurements was developed. Parameters that are important and interesting to study are droplet size and their velocity. The purpose of the facility is to gain quantitative information to optimize the black liquor gasification (BLG) process. For measuring droplets, a non-intrusive laser measurements system is used called Phase Doppler Anemometry (PDA). PDA is the most advantageous technique for measuring droplet velocity and size distribution. The first stage in the work of developing this spray test facility was a brief feasibility study of other pressurized spray testing facilities using PDA, to get information of different concepts. Concepts and configurations of the different parts for the pressurized test facility have been analyzed and investigated with a variety of engineering tools. Because measurements with PDA are very depending on certain receiving angles a deep review of PDA was performed, all to achieve correct placement of the transmitting and receiving optical access windows. The final design resulted in a standing pressure vessel with height 5600 mm and a diameter of 500 mm. The test facility was tested and is approved for a working pressure of 15 bar. To prevent corrosion due to the future application of black liquor atomization, it was made of stainless steel (SS 2343). Four optical access side ports were placed approximately 500 mm from the top of the vessel. The side port for the transmitter probe is located at 0 degrees and the three receiving side ports at 106. 3, 120 and 270 degrees. These angles were chosen to fulfill the requirements and demands essential for PDA. Simulations using CFD have contributed with useful information for the flow behavior inside the vessel and how droplets are affected by it. These simulations gave information about the flow near the optical access side ports and the necessity of optical clearance. The simulations show that recirculated flow carries droplets from the spray that reaches the glass windows, which is not preferable as it may interfere during laser measurements. Initial test runs and experiments confirm the results obtained from the simulations. The outcome of this study became a development of a purging air wall to prevent droplets reaching the glass windows. Fine polished fused quartz glass, especially suitable for laser measurements is used for the glass windows. These glasses are free from inclusions and are distinguished from other glasses by good transmission in UV- and the visible spectral range. A solid mechanic calculation of the glass specimen was performed to determine the thickness of the glass in order to withstand a maximum pressure of 15 bar. An evacuation port was placed in the middle of the vessel to perform evacuation of gas. The evacuation is used for both atmospheric and pressurized conditions. During pressurized runs, a flange lid with a pressure control valve can be attached to this side port to regulate the pressure. Connections for adding a fluid level gauge were placed on the vessel side. On the top of the vessel a unique designed <b>spray</b> <b>lance</b> traversing system were attached on a flange lid. With this arrangement the spray can be rotated and traversed up and down through the top lid. This device enables measurements in a large part of the spray. The test facility has been installed and initial test runs performed. Measuring and optimization of the facility will continue. When optimized, the results of the measurements from this facility will be applied in the BLG project. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
40|$|Bionomics {{of malaria}} vectors {{including}} species composition, resting and biting behaviour and insecticide resistance {{are important for}} insecticide-based malaria control and interventions. The lack of data on malaria vector species composition and relative abundance, resting and biting behaviour, as well as insecticide resistance, make the development of target control measures problematic in Mutare and Mutasa Districts. It is imperative to elucidate, characterize, and identify {{all members of the}} An. funestus group and the An. gambiae complex to determine their resting and biting behaviour, host-seeking activities, disease relationships, and resistance to insecticides. A longitudinal study was carried out to investigate the bionomics of malaria vector mosquitoes in Mutare and Mutasa Districts. Anopheline larval and adult sampling was conducted from May 2013 to December 2014 using scooping, pyrethrum spray catch, prokopac aspirator, exit window trap, pit shelter, and Centers for Disease Control (CDC) light trap methods. Indoor and outdoor resting mosquitoes were collected in randomly selected houses and pit shelters, respectively. Mosquitoes sampled by light traps were divided into two cohorts. In one cohort, traps were left overnight and mosquitoes collected the following morning, while in the other set, mosquitoes were collected hourly throughout the night. Mosquito samples for insecticide resistance testing were divided into two subsamples. One subsample was used immediately for WHO susceptibility assays and the other batch was allowed to oviposit in the insectary at the National Institute of Health Research, and females from the F 1 progeny were used in further susceptibility assays. Mosquitoes were identified using morphological keys and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques. The PCR-based assays showed the presence of four sibling species: Anopheles funestus sensu stricto (90. 8 %, 267 / 294) and An. leesoni (5. 1 %, 15 / 294) of the An. funestus group and An. arabiensis (41. 9 %, 13 / 31) and An. quadriannulatus (48. 4 %, 15 / 31) of the An. gambiae complex. Of the two malaria vectors, An. funestus sensu stricto was more abundant (95. 4 %, 267 / 280) than An. arabiensis (4. 6 %, 13 / 280). Endophilic collections of the An. funestus group and the An. gambiae complex were five times greater than exophilic catches. Nearly 90 % endophilic An. funestus populations were collected on sprayable surfaces and the remainder was caught on unsprayable surfaces. Of the sprayable surfaces catches, 56 % were collected on the roofs; with 44 % on the walls. Of the gravid An. funestus caught, nearly two-thirds (218 / 330) were collected exiting recently pyrethroid-treated structures, with a 24 -hour mortality of less than 10 %. The CDC light trap catches were more abundant indoors (68 %) than outdoors (32 %). Anopheles funestus showed variable indoor and outdoor flight activity rhythms, with two peaks during the night; between 22 : 00 - 23 : 00 hours and 02 : 00 - 04 : 00 hours. Human blood index was 64. 3 %, with Plasmodium falciparum infection rate of 1. 8 %. Wild caught females showed resistance to lambda-cyhalothrin (3. 3 % mortality), deltamethrin (12. 9 % mortality), etofenprox (9. 2 % mortality), and bendiocarb (11. 7 % mortality). F 1 An. funestus females showed resistance to deltamethrin (14. 5 % mortality), lambda-cyhalothrin (6. 9 % mortality), etofenprox (8. 3 % mortality), and bendiocarb (16. 8 % mortality), but were susceptible to DDT and pirimiphos-methyl (100 % mortality). Intensity resistance assay to bendiocarb had 100 % mortality, while deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, and etofenprox had increased knockdown times with mortalities ranging between 66. 7 and 92. 7 % after 24 -hour exposures. The present work revealed important information on the behaviour of malaria vector mosquitoes in Mutare and Mutasa Districts, which if not addressed might threaten gains made in malaria control in the study area. It is imperative to change house-spraying insecticide from pyrethroids to organophosphates or DDT (organochlorine), develop an insecticide resistance management plan, provide <b>extension</b> <b>lances</b> to the house-spraying programme, complement mosquito nets with the use of mosquito repellents and long clothes, and establish a monitoring programme to determine the occurrence and distribution of An. funestus populations in Manicaland Province...|$|R
