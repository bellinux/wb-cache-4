5|$|RNA {{thermometers}} {{are found}} in the 5' UTR of messenger RNA, upstream of a protein-coding gene. Here they are able to occlude the ribosome binding site (RBS) and prevent translation of the mRNA into protein. As temperature increases, the hairpin structure can 'melt' and expose the RBS or <b>Shine-Dalgarno</b> <b>sequence</b> to permit binding of the small ribosomal subunit (30S), which then assembles other translation machinery. The start codon, typically found 8 nucleotides downstream of the <b>Shine-Dalgarno</b> <b>sequence,</b> signals the beginning of a protein-coding gene which is then translated to a peptide product by the ribosome. In addition to this cis-acting mechanism, a lone example of a trans-acting RNA thermometer has been found in RpoS mRNA where it is thought {{to be involved in the}} starvation response.|$|E
5|$|Type I toxin-antitoxin systems {{rely on the}} base-pairing of {{complementary}} antitoxin RNA {{with the}} toxin's mRNA. Translation of the mRNA is then inhibited either by degradation via RNase III or by occluding the <b>Shine-Dalgarno</b> <b>sequence</b> or ribosome binding site. Often the toxin and antitoxin are encoded on opposite strands of DNA. The 5' or 3' overlapping region between the two genes is the area involved in complementary base-pairing, usually with between 19–23 contiguous base pairs.|$|E
5|$|A {{specific}} {{example of}} an RNA thermometer motif is the FourU thermometer found in Salmonella enterica. When exposed to temperatures above 45°C, the stem-loop that base-pairs opposite the <b>Shine-Dalgarno</b> <b>sequence</b> becomes unpaired and allows the mRNA to enter the ribosome for translation to occur. Mg2+ ion concentration {{has also been shown}} to affect the stability of FourU. The most well-studied RNA thermometer is found in the rpoH gene in Escherichia coli. This thermosensor upregulates heat shock proteins under high temperatures through σ32, a specialised heat-shock sigma factor.|$|E

25|$|The first atomic {{structures}} of the ribosome complexed with tRNA and mRNA molecules were solved by using X-ray crystallography by two groups independently, at 2.8 Å and at 3.7 Å. These structures allow one to see the details of interactions of the Thermus thermophilus ribosome with mRNA and with tRNAs bound at classical ribosomal sites. Interactions of the ribosome with long mRNAs containing <b>Shine-Dalgarno</b> <b>sequences</b> were visualized soon after that at 4.5- to 5.5-Å resolution.|$|R

Translation initiation codon recognition is basically mediated by Shine-Dalgarno (SD) and the anti-SD sequences at the small ribosomal RNA (ssu rRNA). In this research, <b>Shine-Dalgarno</b> <b>sequences</b> prediction in Listeria monocytogenes La 111 and Klebsiella pneumoniae KCTC 2242 was investigated.

5|$|In 2010, Sharma et al. {{presented}} a comprehensive analysis of transcription at single-nucleotide resolution by differential RNA-seq that confirmed the known acid induction of major virulence loci, {{such as the}} urease (ure) operon or the cag pathogenicity island (see below). More importantly, this study identified a total of 1,907 transcriptional start sites, 337 primary operons, and 126 additional suboperons, and 66 monocistrons. Until 2010, only about 55 transcriptional start sites (TSSs) were known in this species. Notably, 27% of the primary TSSs are also antisense TSSs, indicating that—similar to E. coli—antisense transcription occurs across the entire H. pylori genome. At least one antisense TSS is associated with about 46% of all open reading frames, including many housekeeping genes. Most (about 50%) of the 5' UTRs are 20–40 nucleotides (nt) in length and support the AAGGag motif located about 6 nt (median distance) upstream of start codons as the consensus <b>Shine–Dalgarno</b> <b>sequence</b> in H. pylori.|$|E

25|$|Small subunit ribosomal RNAs {{in several}} Chlorophyta and euglenid chloroplasts lack motifs for <b>shine-dalgarno</b> <b>sequence</b> recognition, which is {{considered}} essential for translation initiation in most chloroplasts and prokaryotes. Such loss is also rarely observed in other plastids and prokaryotes.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{computer-aided}} {{search for}} potential ribosome recognition sequences of mRNAs from tobacco chloroplasts shows {{that more than}} 90 % of mRNA species contain sequences upstream of the respective initiator codons, which allow base pairing with 3 ′-terminal sequences of small subunit rRNA. This complementarity in several cases involves 16 S rRNA sequences between the canonical CCUCC sequence and the 3 ′-terminal stem/loop structure. The distances between potential ribosome recognition sequences and initiator codons can be up to 25 nucleotides which is much greater {{when compared to the}} spacing of 7 ± 2 nucleotides observed for the classical <b>Shine-Dalgarno</b> <b>sequences</b> in bacterial mRNAs...|$|R
5000|$|The sucA RNA motif is a conserved RNA {{structure}} {{found in}} bacteria {{of the order}} Burkholderiales. [...] RNAs within this motif are always found in the presumed 5' UTR of sucA genes. sucA encodes a subunit of an enzyme that participates in the citric acid cycle by synthesizing succinyl-CoA from 2-oxoglutarate. A part of the conserved structure overlaps predicted <b>Shine-Dalgarno</b> <b>sequences</b> (involved in ribosome binding) of the downstream sucA genes. Because of the RNA motif's consistent gene association and a possible mechanism for sequestering the ribosome binding site, it was proposed that the sucA RNA motif corresponds to a cis-regulatory element. Its relatively complex secondary structure could indicate {{that it is a}} riboswitch. However, the function of this RNA motif remains unknown.|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe rate {{of protein}} {{synthesis}} {{varies according to}} the mRNA sequence in ways that affect gene expression. Global analysis of translational pausing is now possible with ribosome profiling. Here, we revisit an earlier report that <b>Shine-Dalgarno</b> <b>sequences</b> are the major determinant of translational pausing in bacteria. Using refinements in the profiling method as well as biochemical assays, we find that SD motifs have little (if any) effect on elongation rates. We argue that earlier evidence of pausing arose from two factors. First, in previous analyses, pauses at Gly codons were difficult to distinguish from pauses at SD motifs. Second, and more importantly, the initial study preferentially isolated long ribosome-protected mRNA fragments that are enriched in SD motifs. These findings clarify the landscape of translational pausing in bacteria as observed by ribosome profiling...|$|R
25|$|The small ribosomal subunit, {{typically}} {{bound to}} an aminoacyl-tRNA containing the amino acid methionine, binds to an AUG codon on the mRNA and recruits the large ribosomal subunit. The ribosome contains three RNA binding sites, designated A, P and E. The A site binds an aminoacyl-tRNA; the P site binds a peptidyl-tRNA (a tRNA {{bound to the}} peptide being synthesized); and the E site binds a free tRNA before it exits the ribosome. Protein synthesis begins at a start codon AUG near the 5' end of the mRNA. mRNA binds to the P site of the ribosome first. The ribosome is {{able to identify the}} start codon by use of the <b>Shine-Dalgarno</b> <b>sequence</b> of the mRNA in prokaryotes and Kozak box in eukaryotes.|$|E
500|$|Detailed {{structural}} {{analysis of the}} ROSE RNA thermometer revealed that the mismatched bases are actually engaged in nonstandard basepairing that preserves the helical structure of the RNA (see figure). [...] The unusual basepairs consist of G-G, U-U, and UC-U pairs. [...] Since these noncanonical base pairs are relatively unstable, increased temperature causes local melting of the RNA structure in this region, exposing the <b>Shine-Dalgarno</b> <b>sequence.</b>|$|E
500|$|Translation {{starts with}} a chain-initiation codon or start codon. The start [...] codon alone is not {{sufficient}} to begin the process. Nearby sequences such as the <b>Shine-Dalgarno</b> <b>sequence</b> in E. coli and initiation factors are also required to start translation. The most common start codon is AUG, which is read as methionine or, in bacteria, as formylmethionine. Alternative start codons depending on the organism include [...] "GUG" [...] or [...] "UUG"; these codons normally represent valine and leucine, respectively, but as start codons they are translated as methionine or formylmethionine.|$|E
40|$|The genes coding for the β (rpoB) and β′ (rpoC) {{subunits}} of RNA polymerase are fused in the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori but separate {{in other}} taxonomic groups. To {{better understand how}} the unique fused structure evolved, we determined DNA sequences at and around the rpoB-rpoC junction in 10 gastric and nongastric species of Helicobacter and in members of the related genera Wolinella, Arcobacter, Sulfurospirillum, and Campylobacter. We found the fusion to be specific to Helicobacter and Wolinella genera; rpoB and rpoC overlap in the other genera. The fusion may have arisen by a frameshift mutation {{at the site of}} rpoB and rpoC overlap. Loss of good <b>Shine-Dalgarno</b> <b>sequences</b> might then have fixed the fusion in the Helicobacteraceae, even if fusion itself did not confer a selective advantage...|$|R

40|$|Insertion {{sequences}} (ISs) are mobile genetic {{elements in}} bacterial genomes. In general, intergenic IS elements are probably less deleterious for their hosts than intragenic ISs, {{simply because they}} have a lower likelihood of disrupting native genes. However, since promoters, <b>Shine–Dalgarno</b> <b>sequences,</b> and transcription factor binding sites are intergenic and upstream of genes, I hypothesized that not all neighboring gene orientations (NGOs) are selectively equivalent for IS insertion. To test this, I analyzed the NGOs of all intergenic ISs in 326 fully sequenced bacterial chromosomes. Of the 116 genomes with enough IS elements for statistical analysis, 68 have significantly more ISs between convergently oriented genes than expected, and 46 have significantly fewer ISs between divergently oriented genes. This suggests that natural selection molds intergenic IS distributions because they are least intrusive between convergent gene pairs and most intrusive between divergent gene pairs...|$|R

40|$|A 7 kb {{chromosomal}} DNA fragment from R. melilotii was cloned, which complemented temperature-sensitivity of an E. coli amber mutant in rpsA, {{the gene}} for ribosomal protein S 1 (ES 1). From complementation and maxicell analysis a 58 kd protein was identified as the homolog of protein S 1 (RS 1). DNA sequence analysis of the R. melilotii rpsA gene identified a protein of 568 amino acids, which showed 47 % identical amino acid homology to protein S 1 from E. coli. The RS 1 protein lacked the two Cys residues which had been reported {{to play an important}} role for the function of ES 1. Two repeats containing <b>Shine-Dalgarno</b> <b>sequences</b> were identified upstream of the structural gene.

40|$|AbstractSequence-specific endoribonuclease RegB of {{bacteriophage}} T 4 cleaves early phage mRNAs and {{facilitates the}} transition between early and subsequent phases of T 4 gene expression. The {{great majority of}} RegB targets {{have been identified in}} the intergenic regions of T 4 transcripts, frequently in the <b>Shine–Dalgarno</b> <b>sequences.</b> Here we show that localization of RegB targets is not restricted to intergenic regions of mRNA. We detected 30 intragenic RegB sites in T 4 transcripts that are differently susceptible to cleavage. Four RegB-processed mRNAs were previously shown to undergo further processing at so-called “secondary sites”. We have found three additional transcripts carrying clear targets for both RegB and another endoribonuclease. We show that secondary cuts within RegB-processed T 4 mRNAs are generated mainly by Escherichia coli RNase G, but that in some cases RNase E can recognize the same targets. Using plasmid-phage systems we demonstrate that T 4 infection favours cleavage by the host endoribonucleases at these sites...|$|R

40|$|Lysis gene S of phage lambda has a 107 codon {{reading frame}} {{beginning}} with the codons Met 1 -Lys 2 -Met 3. Genetic data have suggested that translational initiation occurs at both Met 1 and Met 3, generating two polypeptides, S 107 and S 105 respectively. We have proposed a model in which the proper scheduling of lysis depends on the partition of translational initiations between the two start codons. Here, using in vitro methods, we show that two stem-loop structures, one immediately upstream of the reading frame and a second approximately 10 codons within the gene, control the partitioning event. Utilizing primer-extension inhibition or 'toeprinting', we show that the two S start codons are served by two adjacent <b>Shine-Dalgarno</b> <b>sequences.</b> Moreover, the timing of lysis supported by the wild-type {{and a number of}} mutant alleles in vivo can be correlated with the ratio of ternary complex formation over Met 1 and Met 3 in vitro.

Then, levels of the enzymatic activity of DHFR were measured to evaluate the efficiency of promoters and terminators in the fused DNA fragment.
