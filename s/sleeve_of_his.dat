25|$|Cats {{have been}} venerated in the Near East since antiquity, a {{tradition}} adopted by Islam, albeit {{in a much}} modified form. According to many hadiths, Mohammad prohibited the persecution and killing of cats. Muhammad purportedly allowed a cat to give birth on his cloak, and cut off the <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> prayer robe rather than wake his favourite cat, a female named Muezza, who was sleeping on it.|$|E
25|$|Throughout his work, Tricky blurs the {{normally}} clear sexual definitions found within hip hop. Despite the heavy influence he drew from American hip hop in his debut album, Maxinquaye, he fights against typical sexual representations by, for example, dressing {{as a woman}} on the side <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> album cover. As many of his tracks blend elements of varying types of music creating a difficult to define sound, so go his lyrics, creating a more ambiguous and blurry take on sexuality.|$|E
2500|$|... 23 March 1961 was {{the tenth}} {{day of a}} 15-day {{endurance}} experiment in a low pressure altitude chamber at the Institute of Biomedical Problems in Moscow. The chamber's atmosphere was at least 50% oxygen. Bondarenko, having completed work for the day, removed some monitoring biosensors from his body and washed his skin with an alcohol-soaked cotton ball, which he then carelessly threw away. The cotton ball landed on an electric hot plate which he was using to brew a cup of tea. The cotton ignited and Bondarenko tried to smother the flames with the <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> woolen coveralls, which caught fire in the chamber's oxygen-rich atmosphere.|$|E

2500|$|Chapter 4 {{continues}} with the satire {{in the form}} of a debate between Inflammable Gass and Mrs. Sigtagatist. When Sigtagatist tells Gass that he should always attend church on Sundays, Gass declares, [...] "if I had not a place of profit that forces me to go to church I'd see the parsons all hang'd a parcel of lying." [...] Sigtigatist then proclaims [...] "O, if it were not for churches & chapels I should not have liv'd so long." [...] She then proudly recalls a figure from her youth, Minister Huffcap, who would [...] "kick the bottom of the Pulpit out, with Passion, would tear off the <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Gown, & set his wig on fire & throw it at the people he'd cry & stamp & kick & sweat and all for the good of their souls." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Islamic tradition, Muezza (or Muʿizza) (...) was the Islamic Prophet Muhammad's {{favorite}} cat. In legend, Muhammad awoke {{one day to}} {{the sounds}} of the Adhan, the Muslim daily call to prayer. Preparing to attend, he began to dress himself; however, he soon discovered his cat Muezza sleeping on the <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> prayer robe. Rather than wake her, he used a pair of scissors to cut the sleeve off, leaving the cat undisturbed. Another story is, upon returning from the mosque, Muhammad received a bow from Muezza. He then smiled and gently stroked his beloved cat three times. While the folktale of Muezza is found in both Muslim and non-Muslim sources and many hadith reference cats in a positive manner, it {{does not appear to be}} attested before the 20th century. It may be based on a similar story told by the followers of the medieval Sufi sheikh Ahmed ar-Rifa'i, who is also said to have cut his sleeve because a cat was sleeping on it, then stitched it up later and said [...] "nothing changed".|$|E
2500|$|Oldfield is a {{motorcycle}} fan and has five bikes. [...] These include a BMW R1200GS, a Suzuki GSX-R750, a Suzuki GSX-R1000, and a Yamaha R1. He {{says that some}} of his inspiration for composing comes from riding them. Throughout his life Oldfield has also had a passion for aircraft and building model aircraft. Since 1980, he has been a licensed pilot and has flown fixed wing aircraft (the first of which was a Beechcraft Sierra) and helicopters (including the Agusta Bell 47G, which featured on the <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> cover version of the ABBA song [...] "Arrival" [...] as a parody of their album artwork).

He has endorsed the Mercedes-Benz S-Class in the Mercedes UK magazine. [...] Oldfield also considers himself to be a Trekkie (fan of the popular science fiction television series Star Trek). He noted in an interview in 2008 that he had two boats.|$|E

60|$|The {{operations}} that followed were singularly unpleasant, and Frank felt {{a good deal}} less enthusiastic about hunting when he washed his hands and the <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> jacket in the creek after they were over.|$|R
2500|$|The print {{depicts the}} {{character}} Satake Shinjūrō {{in a dramatic}} standing pose. His appearance is that <b>of</b> a samurai, <b>his</b> hair styled in a [...] topknot, his feet bare. Her wears a short, bright red kimono decorated with thin white vertical stripes. Over this, he wears a simple grey [...] jacket whose only decoration is a flower motif [...] family crest, which may be a plum blossom variant. His arms {{have been removed from}} the <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> haori which hang down at his sides, and he has a sageo string holding back the long <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> kimono. Both <b>of</b> these are intended to increase his mobility, particularly in combat.|$|R
60|$|He obeyed, {{slipping}} the {{set into}} the <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> flannel shirt.|$|E
6000|$|Phil Briant, {{on hearing}} this, laid down his paddle, also wiped his {{forehead}} with the <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> coat, and exclaimed--"Ditto, says I." ...|$|E

60|$|Ariel {{looked up}} at him with a broad stare of bewilderment. She pulled impatiently at the <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> jacket to attract his notice.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tut, Colfax," [...] {{said the}} Colonel, pulling {{him by the}} <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> greatcoat, [...] "sit down and let the lad finish. And then?" ...|$|E
60|$|Further on lay a {{man with}} one <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> ragged coat removed, showing an {{unsightly}} sore; and above it a label with some writing.|$|E
60|$|Inga {{said nothing}} and {{appeared}} {{not to notice}} the King's failure. So now Rinkitink, with a serious look on his fat, red face, took off his purple robe and rolled up the <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> tunic and tried again.|$|R
60|$|When Charnock stopped, a {{man without}} a coat and with the <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fine white shirt rolled up came out. He as rather an old man and his {{movements}} were slack; his face was hard, {{but on the whole}} expressionless.|$|R
60|$|Peter Blood, {{stripped}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> coat, the <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> coarse shirt {{rolled to}} the elbow, and holding a bloody rag in his hand, stood at gaze a moment. The lady, turning now to confront him, her lips parting in a smile of recognition, was Arabella Bishop.|$|R

60|$|Newman Noggs was {{the sole}} actor.

60|$|Sometimes, of an evening, when Janet {{was helping}} Mrs. Maturin in her {{planting}} or weeding, Insall would join them, rolling up the <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> flannel shirt and kneeling beside {{them in the}} garden paths.

6000|$|... "It is nothing," [...] said La Tour d'Azyr. [...] "A scratch." [...] But his lip writhed, and {{the torn}} <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fine cambric shirt {{was full of}} blood.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{seems to}} be in a 'urry, ma'am," [...] said one of the former, making way for her, and wiping the seat beside him with the <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> coat.|$|E
6000|$|... "Where is he?" [...] {{asked the}} father, with his {{ruminant}} quiet, pulling off first one <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> overcoat, and pausing for Eunice's answer before {{he pulled off}} the other.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{the colour}} of a {{bleached}} skull, his flesh; {{and the long}} hair which flows below his shoulders is milk-white.
