40|$|Configurations of corotating <b>shocks</b> in {{the outer}} {{heliosphere}} are computed {{on the assumption that}} the <b>shocks</b> move at constant speeds between collisions.

Between the points at which the <b>shocks</b> interact, the <b>shocks</b> have the form of Archimedian spirals. <b>Shock</b> configurations are determined for the case of two corotating <b>shock</b> pairs originating at 2. 5 AU and for a single <b>shock</b> pair at 2. 5 AU. In both cases the heliosphere is divided into several distinct regions distinguished by the number of times the particles have passed through a <b>shock.</b> Since the <b>shock</b> strengths decrease when a forward <b>shock</b> interacts with a reverse <b>shock,</b> corotating <b>shocks</b> are expected to be weaker at larger distances from the sun...|$|R

It is expressed that collisionless <b>shocks</b> as a realistic possibility {{of a state of}} matter have been realized not earlier than roughly half a centruy ago. The basic properties of collisionless <b>shocks</b> are noted in preparing the theory of collisionless <b>shocks</b> and a classification of <b>shocks</b> is given in terms of their physical properties, which is developed in the following chapters.
