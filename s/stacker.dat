5|$|The {{product was}} renamed King Supreme in 2001 {{when it was}} {{slightly}} reformulated {{as part of a}} menu restructuring during a period of corporate decline. A later restructuring eliminated the King Supreme in favor of its new BK <b>Stacker</b> line of sandwiches. When the <b>Stacker</b> line was discontinued in the United States shortly after, the Big King returned in November 2013 as a permanent product.|$|E
5|$|With {{the onset}} of the Great Recession in 2008–2009, this narrowly-defined demographic-based sales plan faltered and sales and profits for the chain declined; Burger King's same-store {{comparable}} sales in the United States and Canada declined 4.6% in the three months ended September 30, while McDonald's posted same-store comparable sales growth of 2.5% within the United States. The <b>Stacker</b> line underwent a minor reformulation in 2011 that involved deleting the top layer of cheese and changing the amount of bacon in the sandwiches, and moving the sandwiches from the core section of its menu to the company's value menu. The changed ingredient list and pricing structure created a situation such that the distribution of ingredients did not scale {{at the same rate as}} increasing numbers of burger patties. Consumer Reports' blog The Consumerist noted that two single Stackers at $1.00 included more cheese and more bacon than one double <b>Stacker</b> for $2.00. Three single Stackers had 50% more cheese and double the bacon of one triple <b>Stacker.</b> The <b>Stacker</b> line and other related calorie-heavy menu items were dropped in 2012 when 3G Capital of Brazil bought the company and initiated a menu restructuring focusing on a broader demographic base.|$|E

5|$|BK targets {{specific}} sub-groups {{within the}} adult market. Products like the BK <b>Stacker</b> and BK XXL {{are aimed at}} late teen to young adult males; health-conscious individuals are offered products such as salads, grilled chicken, and veggie burgers. Products such as the BK Veggie, a meatless burger initially introduced in 2002, target the female and health-oriented demographic using a co-branded marketing program and a patty produced by the Kellogg Company's Morningstar Farms division. Another sub-market in this group is on-the-go parents and commuters; The company's BK Chicken Fries—French-fry cut pieces of breaded chicken—is specifically targeted to this segment. First introduced in 2005, the product was successful enough that Burger King expanded the marketing of chicken fries to the children's demographic with a kid's meal version of the product in 2007. The meal was launched with a cross-promotion in conjunction with Nickelodeon's SpongeBob SquarePants. The series of commercials raised the ire of the American Family Association due to perceived nudity concerns.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1980s, several parties, {{including}} the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), the British Heart Foundation, the City of New York, and the Spanish government, {{have argued that}} Burger King has contributed to obesity and unhealthy eating behaviors in Western nations by producing products that contain large amounts of salt, fat, trans-fat and calories. After its purchase by TPG Capital from former parent company Diageo in 2002, the company introduced several large, over-sized products including its European BK XXL line, the British Angus burger six-pack, the Enormous Omelet Sandwich line and the BK <b>Stacker</b> line. These new offerings, and others like them, have resulted in further international scorn and negative attention due the large portion size and increased amounts of unhealthy fats and trans-fats in these items. Many consumer groups have accused Burger King and other fast food restaurant chains of failing to provide healthier alternatives.|$|E
5|$|In 2020, the Jaeger Gipsy Danger, piloted by {{brothers}} Raleigh and Yancy Beckett, defends Anchorage {{from the}} Kaiju Knifehead. They both engage in combat, with Gipsy gaining {{the upper hand}} and defeating the Kaiju by blasting it with its plasma cannon. Unknown to them, the Kaiju is still alive. Knifehead then reemerges, ambushes them, critically damages Gipsy Danger by severing its left arm and throws Yancy out of the cockpit, killing him. Raleigh manages to pilot Gipsy alone, activating the remaining plasma cannon and finally killing Knifehead. Traumatized by Yancy’s death, Raleigh quits the Jaeger Program. In 2025, the world governments decide to end funding for the continuous construction of Jaegers, in favor of building massive coastal walls, but the Kaiju are growing more powerful, their attacks more frequent and Jaegers are being destroyed faster than they are built. The remaining four Jaegers are relocated to Hong Kong {{under the command of}} Marshal <b>Stacker</b> Pentecost, who plans to end the Kaiju War by destroying The Breach using a nuclear weapon.|$|E

25|$|The car {{returned}} for the 2002 season and Hut Stricklin, {{who had just}} joined the team {{at the end of}} the 2001 season from Donlavey Racing, became the driver and was sponsored by Hills Brothers Coffee, which followed him from Donlavey's No. 90 Ford. However, Stricklin missed the season-opening Daytona 500, and failed to record any top ten finishes. He was released following the night race at Bristol, and Hills Brothers announced it was leaving with Stricklin once the season ended. Needing a sponsor, Davis agreed to terms with Kenny Wallace to join the team. At the time, Wallace was without a full Cup ride and had been racing for his Busch Series team, Innovative Motorsports, in an abbreviated Cup schedule after Steve Park, for whom Wallace had been a long-term injury substitute, returned to competition. With the arrangement Wallace would immediately join BDR and drive the No. 23 Hills Brothers Dodge in all but two of the remaining races (his Busch obligations kept him out of the fall Martinsville race and he was already signed to drive the No. 33 car for Andy Petree Racing at Atlanta as part of an arrangement with AT). Beginning in 2003, Wallace's sponsor <b>Stacker</b> 2 would join him at BDR and sponsor the No. 23. The arrangement only lasted one year as Wallace moved down to the Busch Series with <b>Stacker</b> 2 following the 2003 season.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, Wallace {{signed with}} the unsponsored Eel River Racing team, and also was hired to drive the No. 48 Goulds Pumps-sponsored Chevy in the Busch Series {{full-time}} for Innovative Motorsports. After several DNQ's, Wallace resigned from the team to concentrate on his Busch ride. He won his first race in seven years at North Carolina Speedway and finished tenth in points. He also filled in for Steve Park in the Cup Series, winning one pole and nailing down two top tens, including a second-place finish at Rockingham Speedway, tying a career best. He did not win in 2002, but moved up to seventh in the Busch series standings in the No. 48 Chevrolet now sponsored by <b>Stacker</b> 2. He replaced Kevin Harvick in Richard Childress Racing's No. 29 car at Martinsville after the latter was suspended for deliberately wrecking another driver in the Truck Series race the day before. He was hired {{late in the season}} by Bill Davis Racing to replace Hut Stricklin in the No. 23 Hills Brothers Coffee-sponsored Dodge, and was hired to drive the car full-time in 2003, bringing his <b>Stacker</b> 2 sponsorship with him and continuing to drive in the Busch Series for Davis. After one top ten finish, Wallace and the team moved down to the Busch Series in 2004, garnering ten top tens. He also drove in the Cup Series five times for Michael Waltrip Racing.|$|E

Despite its lukewarm reception, an internet meme relating to the sandwich developed rather quickly.

Amid this new super-fan focused menu expansion the chain introduced its new BK <b>Stacker</b> sandwich in late 2006, a family of sandwiches featuring the same set of toppings served as a single, double, triple or quadruple hamburger. The <b>Stacker</b> line was part of a series of larger, more calorie-laden products introduced by the company to entice the super-fan into the chain's restaurants.
