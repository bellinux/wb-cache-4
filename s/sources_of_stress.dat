Program activities included (1) employee and management education on job stress, (2) changes in hospital policies and procedures to reduce organizational <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress,</b> and (3) the establishment of employee assistance programs. In one study, the frequency of medication errors declined by 50% after prevention activities were implemented in a 700-bed hospital. In a second study, there was a 70% reduction in malpractice claims in 22 hospitals that implemented stress prevention activities. In contrast, there was no reduction in claims in a matched group of 22 hospitals that did not implement stress prevention activities.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Since {{there are}} few studies on stress {{experienced}} by nursing staff in private hospitals, this study aimed to determine the <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> job <b>stress</b> among nurses in private hospitals in southwest of Iran. Method: In a cross-sectional design, nurses in private hospitals in Shiraz were investigated; about 160 nurses were selected by single-stage cluster sampling as the study samples in three selected hospitals. A standard questionnaire on the <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> job <b>stress</b> was used for data collection. The data were analyzed through SPSS, version 21, using Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests. The level of significance was considered as 0. 05. Results: Five important causes <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> among nurses were low income, lack of job security, work-home interface, lack of enough time for work, and exposure with unsuitable physical situation. There were significant associations between the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> and having persons with chronic disease in family and concurrent education and work (P = 0. 021, X 2 = 426. 5 and P = 0. 022, X 2 = 717. 5, respectively). Conclusion: The <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> job <b>stress</b> should be considered for effective working of the hospital. Attention to nurses’ salary and job security reduces job stress...|$|R
