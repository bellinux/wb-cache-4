40|$|The {{hydraulic}} {{interception efficiency}} of a gully grating decreases with the steepness {{of the road}} on which it is installed. This {{can lead to a}} higher potential for flooding at the downstream area of a steep road. In this study, the hydraulic inception efficiency of several types of gully gratings on steep roads, including a new grating with <b>angled</b> <b>bars</b> on a parallelogram cross-section was investigated experimentally. The experimental results for all test gratings show that the hydraulic interception efficiency varies linearly with a non-dimensional parameter expressed as a product of the Froude number, water depth to grating length ratio and flow width to grating width ratio. The empirical relationship can be easily included in numerical models for the detailed study and design of storm water drainage systems. The hydraulic performance of the grating with longitudinal bars and the new grating with <b>angled</b> <b>bars</b> on a parallelogram cross-section was better than that of the existing grating. The relative increase in the efficiency increases with the flow velocity, depth and width. While gratings with longitudinal bars may induce inconvenience to cyclists, gratings with <b>angled</b> <b>bars</b> on a parallelogram cross-section may be used on steep roads to enhance the hydraulic interception efficiency of gullies.

40|$|The load {{carrying}} capacity and failure mechanism of 8 square columns strengthened with high-performance ferrocement laminate (HPFL) and bonded steel plates (BSP) were analyzed {{on the basis of}} experiments on the axial compression performance of these columns. Results show that the reinforcing layer worked together with the original columns as a whole, and the load-bearing capacity significantly increased. When failure of the strengthened column occurred, the mortar and concrete were crushed and bulged outward {{in the middle of the}} columns, the <b>angle</b> <b>bars</b> and longitudinal steel bars buckled, and some stirrups were pulled out. The chamfering of <b>angle</b> <b>bar</b> momentously affected the primary damage of steel strand. The values of the strength reduction factor and pressure effective utilization coefficient of the mortar were suggested. Based on the experiments and existing tests of 35 columns strengthened with HPFL, equations for the axial compression bearing capacity were proposed and all calculation results agreed well with testing results. Therefore, the calculation method could be used in the capacity design of axial compression strengthened columns...|$|R

40|$|The {{full text}} of this article will not be {{available}} in ULIR until the embargo expires on the 20 / 7 / 2019 The increasing use of composite materials for lightweight structural applications and the extended tailoring capabilities offered by variable stiffness laminates requires rapid and robust analysis tools that adequately describe the mechanical behaviour of such structures. In this work, a Rayleigh–Ritz solution for generally restrained multilayered <b>stiffened</b> variable <b>angle</b> tow plates in the post-buckling regime is presented. The plate model is based on first-order shear deformation theory and accounts for geometrical nonlinearity through von Kármán’s assumptions. General symmetric and unsymmetric stacking sequences are considered and Legendre orthogonal polynomials are employed to approximate the unknown displacement field. <b>Stiffened</b> variable <b>angle</b> tow plates are modeled as an assembly of plate-like elements and penalty techniques are used to enforce the displacements continuity of the assembled multidomain structure and also to apply the kinematical boundary conditions. The developed postbuckling analysis is sufficiently versatile to model {{a wide range of}} configurations and load cases for multi-component, variable angle tow, composite structures, and provide the same accuracy level as finite element analysis. The proposed solution is validated by comparison with literature and finite elements analysis and original results are presented for the thermo-mechanical post-buckling solution of multilayered <b>stiffened</b> variable <b>angle</b> tow plates.

An aerodynamic test bench was used to study the coolant flow processes in a TVSA-type fuel assembly bundle. To obtain more detailed information on the coolant flow dynamics, a VVER- 1000 reactor core fragment was selected as the test model, which comprised two segments of a TVSA- 12 PLUS fuel assembly and one segment of a TVSA-T assembly with <b>stiffening</b> <b>angles</b> and an interassembly gap. The studies into the coolant fluid dynamics consisted in measuring the velocity vector both in representative TVSA regions and inside the interassembly gap using a five-channel pneumometric probe. An analysis into the spatial distribution of the absolute flow velocity projections made it possible to detail the TVSA spacer, mixing and combined spacer grid flow pattern, identify the regions with the maximum transverse coolant flow, and determine the depth of the coolant flow disturbance propagation and redistribution in adjacent TVSA assemblies. The results of the studies into the interassembly coolant interaction among the adjacent TVSA assemblies are used at OKBM Afrikantov to update the VVER- 1000 core thermal-hydraulic analysis procedures and {{have been added to the}} database for verification of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes and for detailed cellwise analyses of the VVER- 100 reactor cores...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{downstream}} migrant silver phase American eels Anguilla rostrata to guide along various configurations of <b>angled</b> <b>bar</b> racks (25 - and 50 -mm clear spacing) and louvers (50 -mm clear spacing) was evaluated {{in a laboratory}} flume. Guidance tests were conducted with bar racks and louvers angled at 45 and 15 degrees to the approach flow at velocities of 0. 3 m/s to 0. 9 m/s. A full-depth bypass was used for all tests. Guidance efficiency was calculated by dividing the number of fish recovered from the bypass {{by the total number}} recovered downstream (bypass and entrainment combined). Mean guidance efficiency (MGE) with the 45 -degree, 25 -mm bar rack ranged from a low of 56. 8 % at 0. 6 m/s to a high of 65. 9 % at 0. 9 m/s. MGE of the 45 -clegree, 50 -mm bar rack decreased from 72. 7 % at 0. 3 m/s to 54. 5 % at 0. 9 m/s, while MGE of the 45 -clegree louver ranged from a low of 34. 9 % at 0. 3 m/s to a high of 61. 9 % at 0. 6 m/s. Guidance efficiency was considerably higher for tests with the 15 -degree structures, exceeding 88 % at all velocities during tests with a solid bottom overlay placed over the lower 30 cm of each structure. During tests without the overlay in place and at a velocity of 0. 6 m/s, guidance efficiency of both bar racks and louvers decreased to 83. 3 and 60. 7 %, respectively. The estimated guidance efficiencies indicate that <b>angled</b> <b>bar</b> racks and louvers have potential for diverting American eels away from hydro intakes, particularly if a shallow angle is employed (e. g., 15 degrees to the approach flow). However, we believe our estimates of guidance efficiency are higher than would be experienced at an actual intake due to the full depth bypass, the limited depth of the flume, and the short length of each rack configuration that we evaluated...|$|R
