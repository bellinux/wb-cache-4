5|$|A Rio {{police officer}} who works with Hobbs' team and becomes Dominic's love interest. It was {{confirmed}} on July 16, 2010, that Pataky would take this role. She underwent several days of tactical training with a police/military technical advisor and was required {{to learn how to}} handle her gun in a variety of <b>situations</b> <b>to</b> portray Elena believably.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, Mike Marshall won the award, {{becoming}} the first relief pitcher to win the award. In 1992, Dennis Eckersley was the first modern closer (first player to be used almost exclusively in ninth-inning <b>situations)</b> <b>to</b> win the award, and since then only one other relief pitcher has won the award, Éric Gagné in 2003 (also a closer). A total of nine relief pitchers have won the Cy Young Award across both leagues.|$|E
5|$|Notwithstanding that in NASA's {{judgment}} {{the contractor}} later made {{significant progress in}} overcoming the problems, the committee believes {{it should have been}} informed of the situation. The committee does not object to the position of the Administrator of NASA, that all details of Government/contractor relationships should not be put in the public domain. However, that position in no way can be used as an argument for not bringing this or other serious <b>situations</b> <b>to</b> the attention of the committee.|$|E

50|$|A person's {{attitude}} and behavior both vary from <b>situation</b> <b>to</b> <b>situation.</b> Behaviors may vary {{as when a}} person who rarely edits Wikipedia does so for a class assignment. Attitudes also vary from <b>situation</b> <b>to</b> <b>situation.</b> A college freshman may disapprove of binge drinking, only to subsequently become socialized to practice and celebrate doing so {{in the course of}} tailgating. Sometimes attitudes and behavior may be linked to reduce cognitive dissonance. But this need not be the case.|$|R
5|$|The {{dropping}} {{of final}} short vowels in verb forms tended to erase mood distinctions, {{but also some}} gender distinctions; however, unexpected vowel lengthening occurred in many <b>situations</b> <b>to</b> preserve the distinctions. For example, in the suffix conjugation, first-singular *-tu {{appears to have been}} remade into *-tī already by Proto-Hebrew on the basis of possessive -ī (likewise first singular personal pronoun *ʔana became *ʔanī).|$|E
5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} {{has been}} more broadly described {{as the ability to}} adjust one’s thinking from old <b>situations</b> <b>to</b> new situations as well as the ability to overcome responses or thinking that have become habitual and adapt to new situations. As such, if one is able to overcome previously held beliefs or habits (when it is required for new situations) then they would be considered cognitively flexible. Lastly, the ability to simultaneously consider two aspects of an object, idea, or situation at one point in time refers to cognitive flexibility. According to this definition, when sorting cards based on specific rules, children are considered cognitively flexible if they can sort cards based on the color of the objects and type of objects on the card simultaneously. Similarly, cognitive flexibility has been defined as having the understanding and awareness of all possible options and alternatives simultaneously within any given situation.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the Storm Prediction Center, National Severe Storms Laboratory and National Weather Service Norman Forecast Office {{moved their}} {{respective}} operations into the newly constructed National Weather Center, near Westheimer Airport. Since the agency's relocation to Norman, the 557th Weather Wing at Offutt Air Force Base would assume control of issuing the Storm Prediction Center's severe weather {{products in the}} event that the SPC is no longer able to issue them {{in the event of an}} outage (such as a computer system failure or building-wide power disruption) or emergency (such as an approaching strong tornadic circulation or tornado on the ground) affecting the Norman campus; on April 1, 2009, the SPC reassigned responsibilities for issuing the center's products in such <b>situations</b> <b>to</b> the 15th Operational Weather Squadron based out of Scott Air Force Base.|$|E

5|$|Kakashi was {{originally}} created by Kishimoto to be a harsh teacher but the author decided to avoid that. Instead, he {{made him more}} generous to calm his students in difficult <b>situations</b> <b>to</b> the point of giving him feminine traits. Kakashi's design gave Kishimoto difficulties {{as a result of}} having most of his face covered and as a result it was difficult to show his emotions. For the anime series, he is voiced by Kazuhiko Inoue in Japanese and Dave Wittenberg in the English dub.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the events}} of the series, the {{pioneering}} scientist Professor Humbert invented the Minimiser, a device capable of shrinking people or objects to one third of their original size. After Humbert's death, it was passed down to Father Unwin, who conceals his deceased parishioner's parting gift inside a copy of Milner's Gallery of Nature. The regular focus of the Minimiser is Harding, whom Unwin reduces to a height of two feet (0.6m) to enable him to infiltrate <b>situations</b> <b>to</b> which no ordinary-sized person could make a discreet entry. In this manner, the Harding puppet interacts with life-sized sets and live actors whose faces are excluded from shots. The Minimiser is also used to shrink enemy agents, literally bringing them down to Harding's size.|$|E
5|$|The group {{recorded}} with Finn {{over a period}} of three months at numerous locations in their hometown of San Diego and in Los Angeles. Finn was key in producing the fast-paced, melodic mixes, creating pop punk with a more radio-friendly, accessible polish. Lyrically, the album is inspired by adolescent frustration and relationships. Guitarist Tom DeLonge and bassist Mark Hoppus primarily culled stories from friends and autobiographical <b>situations</b> <b>to</b> craft summery tracks revolving around breakups, suburban parties and maturity, as well as more offbeat subject matter such as UFO conspiracy theories. The cover artwork for Enema of the State features porn star Janine Lindemulder famously clad in a nurse uniform, and the title is a pun on the term enemy of the state.|$|E

5|$|Today, {{the duties}} of the sheriff include law {{enforcement}} services of the two county courthouses and surrounding property, service of court-ordered warrants, writs, protective orders, and other injunctions, and limited patrol responsibility with the County Police. The Domestic Violence Unit has expanded its role in the county to include responding to calls for service that are domestic-related. The creation of the School Resource Deputy division has placed a deputy sheriff at all of the local high schools, replacing the County Police. All other law enforcement services of the county are provided by multiple agencies but mostly left to the separate Prince George's County Police Department (PGPD), though some responsibilities are shared by both agencies. The PGSO, like most other county-level law enforcement agencies in the United States, is a progressive agency with an array of services in tom a Specialized Services Team dealing with high-risk arrest warrants and barricaded <b>situations</b> <b>to</b> community services aiding the county's residents in safety education. Although the agency is not yet nationally accredited, it currently has a unit dedicated to accreditation.|$|E
5|$|With his {{contract}} set to expire after the 2007 season, Rivera sought an extension with the Yankees during spring training. Team management refused to negotiate near {{the start of}} the season, prompting him to respond that he would consider free agency {{at the end of the}} year. In April, Rivera blew his first two save opportunities, compiled two losses, and surrendered nine earned runs in innings pitched. Concerned sportswriters attributed his struggles to infrequent use, as the Yankees presented him with few <b>situations</b> <b>to</b> enter a game. Rivera saved 30 of his next 32opportunities and posted a 2.26ERA over the final five months of the season. In addition, he passed John Franco for third place on the all-time saves list with his 425th career save. Still, Rivera finished 2007 with closer career worsts in earned runs (25), hits (68), and ERA (3.15), and his 30saves in 34opportunities were his second-lowest total since 1997. After the Yankees were eliminated from the playoffs in the opening round, Rivera stated his intentions to test the free agent market. He initially indicated that his decision of where to sign would be influenced by whether long-time manager Joe Torre was re-signed. Although Torre did not return, Rivera remained with the Yankees by agreeing to a three-year, $45million contract, making him the highest-paid reliever in baseball history.|$|E
