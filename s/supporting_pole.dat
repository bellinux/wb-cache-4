50|$|Another {{method was}} {{to bury the}} dog alive leaving only its head {{sticking}} out or attach the dog to a <b>supporting</b> <b>pole,</b> put some food {{in front of the}} dog, cut the dog's neck just when it is about to starve so that the head would fly towards and bite at the food, burn the dog into mere bones, put the remains into a vessel, and deify it. By doing so, it will spiritually possess that person forever, granting their wishes. Another method was to set several dogs to fight against each other, give the one dog remaining alive some fish, cut off that dog's head, and eat the remaining fish. In Yamaga, Hayami District, Ōita Prefecture (now Kitsuki), there were actual cases where a miko did cut off a dogs' heads this way, dried the maggots that gathered at the heads, and sold them calling it inugami, and there were also people who were thankful for these and bought them.|$|E
50|$|Ogawa {{was killed}} in an {{accident}} on lap 27 of a Japanese Formula 3000 race held at Suzuka in May 1992. Ogawa aimed to overtake Andrew Gilbert-Scott's car on the main straight, but the latter held his position while Ogawa moved slightly to the side. He clipped the rear left wheel and the front of his car became lodged in the rear bodywork. Both went down the straight at speed and went into the gravel trap, which was insufficient in slowing down either car. Gilbert-Scott spun, hit the tyre wall and flipped, landing upside-down. Ogawa went in nose-first, hit a mound in the gravel trap and was launched over the tyre barrier, hitting a high-fence <b>supporting</b> <b>pole.</b> Both cars were wrecked and the race was stopped immediately. As a result of the accident at least one cameraman, several photographers, and Gilbert-Scott all sustained injuries.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the electron optical system of an 8 -in. spherical MCP-PMT.

With the simulation software CST, the Finite Integration method and the Monte Carlo method are combined to evaluate the collection efficiency, the time properties and the Earth&# 39;s magnetic field effects. Simulation {{results show that the}} photocathode active solid angle is over 3. 5 pi sr, the average collection efficiency can exceed 95 % with the coated MCP and the mean transit time spread is 2. 2 ns for a typical electric potential of 500 V applied between the photocathode and the MCP input facet.

40|$|The spine is the body's {{support system}} and a <b>supporting</b> <b>pole</b> to the whole skeleton, {{therefore}} {{it is important to}} take good care of it to prevent its deformities, such as scoliosis. Scoliosis is a serious illness which can appear at a really young age. Nowadays, it's timely detection and early treatment is achieved through not only expert orthopaedic check-up, but mainly through radiological examination, mostly skiagraphy. In my bachelor thesis named "Skiascopic and skiagraphic examination of the spine with a focus on scoliosis" I deal with skiagraphic and fluoroscopic options of examining the spine, the issues of scoliosis in general and with specific statistical analysis of incidents of scoliotic changes recorded at the Radiological clinic of the University hospital Brno, at the department of adult medicine. In the introduction, I explain the basic anatomy of the spine including the movement possibilities of individual spinal parts, such as tilting or rotation. The differences between cervical, thoracic and lumbar part of the spine, and their individual vertebrae, are described. In the next part, I focus on the basic principles of skiagraphy and fluoroscopy. It's important to realise what these examination techniques involve, how they work and why are they indispensable parts of examination process of scoliosis. The origin of x-rays and its types are explicated. I also devote a little subchapter to digitalisation, because in modern medicine, it's gradually replacing original technology of recording on film screens, and its use requires minor adjustements of the skiagraphy procedure. The third part of the bachelor thesis focuses on individual skiascopic and skiagraphic examinations of the spine. I describe procedures of skiagraphy of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar part of the spine including the projection of the sacrum. I mention special skiagraphic methods performed in the process of intentional detection or observation of scoliotic changes, including telemetric pictures composed into the long format. From the skiscopic examinations, I marginally chose myelography and discography, application of which is currently almost none thanks to modern examination methods such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. In the next chapter, I'm finnaly dealing with the topic of scoliosis itself. The basic classification according to aetiology is shown, I also explain the difference between idiopathic, congenial and neuromuscular scoliosis. Also, I clarify by what reference is the scoliosis' curvature measured and what terms are used to describe scoliosis. The chapter concludes by brief explanation of therapy used for scoliosis. The second part of the thesis includes my research. I present the goals of the work and anticipated hypothesis. I explain where and in what conditions the data collection took place, including description of the process of telemetrical screening at the forementioned workplace in Brno. I also present outcome achieved by statistical processing of data, including my commentary based on hypothesis and acquired experience. In the discussion, I compared incidents of scoliosis today according to my research with professional literature focused on scoliosis. Furthermore, I mentioned options of spinal issues prevention, including related illnesses. I also enclose suggestion of utilization of my work in practice, which, as I hope, will be a usefull addition to clinical research for University hospital Brno. In the last part of my dissertation, I summarize all my findings from the thesis and enclose, along with the list of used literature and internet links, attachments in the form of expertly described radiographs of scoliotical spines, which I obtained, with the consent of the staff, also ati the University hospital Brno...|$|E
