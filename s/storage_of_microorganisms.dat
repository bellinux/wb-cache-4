40|$|From {{the large}} number of methods used for <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> <b>microorganisms,</b> the more {{effective}} methods are long-term cryopreservation and lyophilization. The temperature change rate, controls transport of water around cell membranes and indirectly likelihood of intracellular freezing. If the cooling is too fast, the membranes cannot carry water out of the cell and freezing inside. Each cell has an optimum cooling rate, while the survival of very low absolute except that cryoprotector is present to reduce freezing damage. In the present study we proposed to determine the efficiency of some techniques on long term microorganisms conservation as cryopreservation and freeze-drying and the influence of cryoprotectants used in various concentrations on survival rate of bacterial strains during cryopreservtion at - 80 ° C in freezer and - 196 ° C in liquid nitrogen. These 7 bacterial strains used for this work came from our collection of cultures, and are represented by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonie, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella enterica., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Lactobacillus casei. The cryoprotectant used are: dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) at a concentration of 5 % and 10 %, ethylene glycol (EG) at a concentration of 5 % and 10 %, glycerol(Gl) at a concentration of 5 % and 10 %, propylene glycol (PG) at a concentration of 5 % to 10 %...|$|E
40|$|Freezing and {{lyophilization}} {{are common}} methods used for preservation and <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> <b>microorganisms</b> during {{the production of}} concentrated starter cultures destined for industrial fermentations or product formulations. The compatible solute trehalose has been widely reported to protect bacterial, yeast and animal cells against a variety of environmental stresses, particularly freezing and dehydration. Analysis of the Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM genome revealed a putative trehalose utilization locus consisting of a transcriptional regulator, treR; a trehalose phosphoenolpyruvate transferase system (PTS) transporter, treB; and a trehalose- 6 -phosphate hydrolase, treC. The objective {{of this study was}} to characterize the tre locus in L. acidophilus and determine whether or not intracellular uptake of trehalose contributes to cryoprotection. Cells subjected to repeated freezing and thawing cycles were monitored for survival in the presence of various concentrations of trehalose. At 20 % trehalose a 2 -log increase in survival was observed. The trehalose PTS transporter and trehalose hydrolase were disrupted by targeted plasmid insertions. The resulting mutants were unable to grow on trehalose, indicating that both trehalose transport into the cell via a PTS and hydrolysis via a trehalose- 6 -phosphate hydrolase were necessary for trehalose fermentation. Trehalose uptake was found to be significantly reduced in the transporter mutant but unaffected in the hydrolase mutant. Additionally, the cryoprotective effect of trehalose was reduced in these mutants, suggesting that intracellular transport and hydrolysis contribute significantly to cryoprotection...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{interaction}} of corrugated and plastic materials with pathogenic and spoiling microorganisms frequently associated to fresh produce. The effect of the two packaging materials on the survival during the <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> <b>microorganisms</b> belonging to the species Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enteritidis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Lactobacillus plantarum, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Aspergillus flavus was studied through traditional plate counting and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results obtained showed that cardboard materials, if correctly stored, reduced the potential of packaging to cross-contaminate food due to a faster viability loss by spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms compared to the plastic ones. In fact, the cell loads of the pathogenic species considered decreased over time independently on the inoculation level and packaging material used. However, the superficial viability losses were significantly faster in cardboard compared to plastic materials. The same behavior was observed for the spoilage microorganisms considered. The SEM microphotographs indicate that the reduction of superficial contamination on cardboard surfaces {{was due to the}} entrapping of the microbial cells within the fibers and the pores of this material. In addition, SEM data showed that the entrapped cells were subjected to more or less rapid lyses, depending on the species, due to the absence of water and nutrients, with the exception of molds. The latter spoilers were able to proliferate inside the cardboard fibers only when the absorption of water was not prevented during the storage. In conclusion, the findings of this work showed the reduction of cross-contamination potential of corrugated compared to plastic packaging materials used in fruit and vegetable sector. However, the findings outlined the importance of hygiene and low humidity during cardboard storage to prevent the mold growth on packaging...|$|E

40|$|Viability of {{lyophilized}} fungus cultures {{was tested}} {{after one year}} storage at a tem-perature of 2 to 6 °C. In 10 of 13 lyophilized cultures a slight but non-significant decrease in viability occurred. Only for 3 lyophilized strains stored in a refrigerator less than 78 % of the fungus units were viable when compared with original values found immediately after lyophilization. This decrease was significant. Viability of all lyophilized cultures stored at room temperature decreased significantly or highly significantly with no differences between samples stored in the dark or light.

40|$|The {{microbiological}} quality of raw milk {{from the perspective}} of the health of dairy products is one of the most important features. The amount <b>of</b> <b>microorganisms</b> is influenced by storage temperature and time of milk. In the thesis was observed dynamics of total bacteria count (TBC) in raw milk depending on the selected factors (months, seasons, point of collection, the length <b>of</b> <b>storage).</b> To life <b>of</b> <b>microorganisms</b> contributes warm weather. The largest increase in TBC was observed in the months of April and May to 108 thousand / 1 Ml. It is necessary to place great emphasis on rapid cooling of milk (max 150 min.) to the desired temperature (8 °C). Increase TBC could be caused by long transportation time of sampling raw milk from a milk vending machine to evaluate the quality and microbiological indicators. In the second part of the thesis are compares the quality and microbiological characteristics of raw milk from selected milk vending machines. When evaluating the samples taken from the farm, average values of TBC were higher (43 thousand/ml) compared to samples collected from the milk vending machines (6 thousand/ml). Reason of higher values from farms could be caused by poor hygiene of the milk and his secondary contaminations. In contrast, the average results from samples taken from the milk vending machines were more than excellent. That´s shows tight control of cooling milk during transportation from the farm to the milk vending machine.

40|$|The {{effects of}} various {{substances}} on {{the viability of}} freeze-dried cells of Pseudomonas fluorescens and Salmonella newport were studied during storage in vacuo for 5 years. Mixtures of two organisms were dried together and studied in two factorial experiments. The first was a complete factorial using six factors and two levels; the second was a fractional replicate with four factors at two levels and three others at four concentrations. A study of ribose binding by cells of S. newport was made by using [U- 14 C]ribose. Substantial improvements in viability were obtained by drying {{in the presence of}} sucrose, glutamate, and semicarbazide. Low concentrations of ribose increased the death rate during drying, but these adverse effects were prevented by equimolar amounts of semicarbazide. Ribose binding increased with storage time and, although its incorporation changed, most of the increase in total ribose occurred after the main decrease in viability. Storage temperature caused larger changes in viability than did level changes of residual water in the cells. Although the results are complicated by a large number of interactions, they confirm and extend the hypothesis that reactions between carbonyl compounds and cellular components are a major cause of the mortality occurring during <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> dried <b>microorganisms.</b> A particular mixture of sucrose, glutamate, and semicarbazide is proposed as a means of reducing death when prolonged storage in the dry state is desired...|$|R

Introduction of Chapter 2 is devoted to foodborne illness ? intoxication and toxic infection, which can occur in humans after ingestion of improperly cooked food or due to poor <b>storage.</b> One <b>of</b> the subsections of Chapter 2 is focused on fungi, which are in search of microbiological work, often neglected, although they are very important pathogens and undesirable elements in food. Another chapter is devoted to meat technology and includes terminology that is used in this field. In addition, summarizes the basic requirements, preconditions and standards associated with the meat industry...|$|R
30|$|Determination and {{quantification}} {{of basic}} physiological groups <b>of</b> <b>microorganisms</b> in rhizosphere soil of chickpea plants was performed using standard microbiological methods [14]. Sowing <b>of</b> <b>microorganisms</b> on culture media {{are made of}} 10 − 3 dilutions (fungi and cellulose destructive bacteria) and 10 − 4 (other <b>microorganisms).</b> Sowing <b>of</b> each dilution was performed at least three times. Calculation {{of the total number}} <b>of</b> <b>microorganisms</b> on nutrient media was performed on the third, fifth, and seventh day of incubation. After counting the number of colonies on the surface, the number <b>of</b> <b>microorganisms</b> in 1  ml of the appropriate dilution was determined. In the estimation of the number <b>of</b> cells <b>of</b> <b>microorganisms</b> in 1  g of wet soil, the result obtained was multiplied by the degree of dilution (103, 104, 105, etc.). To determine the number <b>of</b> <b>microorganisms</b> in 1  g of dry soil, the respective number of cells in 1  g of wet soil was multiplied by a correction factor of soil moisture [12, 14].|$|R
50|$|The spore {{count is}} used as an {{indirect}} measure of the number <b>of</b> <b>microorganisms</b> present. Typically 99% <b>of</b> <b>microorganisms</b> by species will be non-spore forming and able to survive in dormant states, and so the actual number <b>of</b> viable dormant <b>microorganisms</b> remaining on the sterilized spacecraft {{is expected to be}} many times the number <b>of</b> spore-forming <b>microorganisms.</b>|$|R
40|$|Summary. Sugar beet {{is one of}} the {{strategic}} crops for food safety of Russia. The lack of specialized warehouse for harvest does not provide <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> roots for a long time. In the case of a thaw roots that have been defrosted unsuitable for processing. Beet and products of its processing is a good object for the development <b>of</b> <b>microorganisms.</b> Permanent microflora <b>of</b> sugar production are: Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium perfringes, Leuconostoc dextranicum, Torula alba, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Sarcina lutea and other kinds <b>of</b> <b>microorganisms,</b> leading to a problem processing of beet root and reduced quality of sugar. The most dangerous is the slimy bacteriosis is a bacterial disease beet caused by heterofermentative cocci of Leuconostoc (Leuconostoc mesenteroides, L. dextranicum). Product of the vital activity <b>of</b> <b>microorganisms</b> is dextran, which is synthesized from sucrose as a result of dextrany or mucous fermentation and leads to significant technological problems in processing of infected beet. Improving the efficiency of sugar production is connected with decrease in loss of quality of raw material preparation, storing and processing of sugar beet. At sugar plants use a variety of drugs that suppress the growth of pathogenic microflora, but there comes a rapid adaptation <b>of</b> <b>microorganisms,</b> therefore {{there is a need to}} implement new products to prevent damage to roots and improve the quality of produced sugar. To resolve this problem experimentally selected bactericidal drug, defined its rational concentration and conditions for the use in sugar beet production. The use of antibacterial drug in the process of extraction allows to increase the purity of diffusion juice 1. 3 %, reduce the protein content in it (12. 5 %); with the purity of the pure juice increases by 1. 1 %, its color index is reduced by 44. 7 %...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to study the <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> the residue from the {{extraction}} of cassava starch without the use <b>of</b> <b>storage</b> technologies, through chemical evaluation, pH values, temperature, development <b>of</b> <b>microorganisms</b> and mycotoxins. A randomized block design was used with eight treatments (different storage periods: 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21 days) and five replications. There was a significant difference for DM content, as a function <b>of</b> days in <b>storage.</b> The chemical composition of the residue from the extraction of cassava starch did not changed throughout the storage period. A negative linear effect was obtained for the pH values, which decreased with days in storage. There was significance <b>of</b> the <b>storage</b> period only for the fungus and yeast population, which increased up to 17 days <b>of</b> <b>storage,</b> with subsequent reduction. Mycotoxins were detected in the residue from the extraction of cassava starch. Despite it did not showed changes in the chemical composition the <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> residue from the extraction of cassava starch for 21 days proved to be an inefficient preservation process, due to the development of molds and mycotoxin...|$|R

The total number <b>of</b> <b>microorganisms</b> was greatest during the summer. The representatives of genus Pseudomonas predominated in quantitative aspect among the bacteria. Moulds were found during all seasons, regardless of their small quantity in the total number <b>of</b> <b>microorganisms.</b> Actinomycetes were isolated only during the summer months and yeasts were not found. The performed investigations give a possibility pure cultures to be used for recovering of the disrupted ratio <b>of</b> <b>microorganisms</b> in the activated sludge at extreme situations...|$|R
