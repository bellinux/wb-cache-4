60|$|So {{much for}} shame's being a dreadful and horrible thing. But again, it {{is a spiritual}} thing: it grows and works not in our fleshly bodies, but in our spirits, our consciences, our immortal souls. You may see this by {{thinking}} {{of people who are}} not afraid of shame. You do not respect them, or think them the better for that. Not at all. If a man is not afraid of shame; if a man, when he is found out, and exposed, and comes to shame, does not care for it, but 'brazens out his own shame,' as we say, we do not call him brave; we call him what he is, a base impudent person, lost to all good feeling. Why, what harder name can we call any man or woman, than to say that they are 'shameless,' dead to shame? We know that it is the very <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> their <b>being</b> <b>dead</b> in sin, the very <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> God's Spirit having left them; that till they are made to feel shame there is no hope of their mending or repenting, or <b>of</b> any good <b>being</b> put into them, or coming out of them. So that this feeling of shame is a spiritual feeling, which {{has to do with a}} man's immortal soul, with his conscience, and the voice of God in his heart.|$|R
6000|$|At {{that point}} Abraham's trial finished. He had shewn the {{completeness}} of his faith by the completeness of his works, that is, by the completeness of his obedience. He had utterly given up all for God. He had submitted his will completely to God's will. He {{had said in}} heart, as our Blessed Lord said, [...] "Father, if it be possible, let this woe pass from me, nevertheless, not as I will, but as Thou wilt;" [...] and thus I say, he was justified by his works, by his actions; that is, by this faithful action he proved the faithfulness of his heart, as the Angel said to him, [...] "Now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me:" [...] for as St. James says, [...] "Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar? Seest thou," [...] says he, [...] "how his faith wrought with his works;" [...] how his works were the tool or instrument which his faith used; and by his works his faith was brought to perfection, as a tree is brought to perfection when it bears fruit. [...] "And so," [...] St. James continues, [...] "the scripture was fulfilled, which says, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness; and he was called the friend of God. Ye see then," [...] he says, [...] "how that by works a man is justified," [...] or shewn to be righteous and faithful, [...] "and not by faith only;" [...] that is, not by the mere feeling of faith, for, as he says, [...] "as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also." [...] For what is the <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> a <b>being</b> <b>dead?</b> It is its {{not being able to}} do anything, not being able to work; because there is no living and moving spirit in it. And what is the <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> a man's faith <b>being</b> <b>dead?</b> his faith not being able to WORK, because there is no living spirit in it, but it is a mere dead, empty shell and form of words,--a mere notion and thought about believing in a man's head, but not a living trust and loyalty to God in his heart. Therefore, says St. James, [...] "shew me thy faith without thy works," [...] if thou canst, [...] "and I will shew thee my faith by my works," [...] as Abraham did by offering up Isaac his son.|$|R
