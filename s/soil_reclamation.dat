30|$|The layered {{soil type}} {{in our study}} had a {{comparable}} biomass response to FFMM in most scenarios, similar to other studies where layered <b>reclamation</b> <b>soils</b> tended to have intermediate levels of inorganic nitrogen, resulting in an intermediate plant growth response (McMillan et al. 2007). Layering {{may also be a}} viable <b>reclamation</b> <b>soil</b> option because it concentrates the seed bank present in the FFMM to the surface layer rather than burying seeds and propagules at depth (MacKenzie and Quideau 2011). Layering also creates a break in the soil column which can result in a greater water holding capacity, an important factor in drier climates such as in northern Alberta (Li et al. 2014; Zettl et al. 2011).|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} of the work were to study phosphorus (P) dynamics in postmining soils under short rotation coppices {{at different stages of}} Robinia pseudoacacia L. growth (2, 3, 4, and 14 years old). From the results obtained, the amount of total P, total organic P, plant available P, and P stock increased with increasing age of R. pseudoacacia. However, values were very low compared to that recommended for optimum plant growth, reflecting a general deficit in P. Additionally, the P sorption and desorption processes were investigated. The total P sorption capacity obtained from the laboratory experiments was on average, 2. 5 times greater for soils under the oldest R. pseudoacacia than values measured at the younger sites. Values of P saturation factor (α) were comparatively lower compared to that reported in the literature. This may be attributed primarily to the less P saturation of the postmining soils, coupled with rather small contents of oxalate iron Feox and aluminium Alox (sum of 47 [*]mmol[*]kg− 1). Results demonstrate significant difference between 2 and 14 years old R. pseudoacacia; thus establishing of short rotation coppice (SRC) on degraded marginal sites may be a valuable method of <b>soil</b> <b>reclamations...</b>|$|R

40|$|Successful mine <b>soil</b> <b>reclamation</b> {{facilitates}} ecosystem recovery, minimizes adverse environmental impacts, creates additional {{lands for}} agricultural or forestry uses, and enhances the carbon (C) sequestration. Nanoparticles with extremely high reactivity and deliverability {{can be applied}} as amendments to improve soil quality, mitigate soil contaminations, ensure safe land–application of the conventional amendment materials (e. g., manures and biosolids), and enhance soil erosion control. However, there is no report on using nanoenhanced materials for mine <b>soil</b> <b>reclamation.</b> Through reviewing the up-to-date research results on using environment-friendly nanoparticles for agricultural soil quality improvement and for contaminated soil remediation, this paper synthesizes that these nanomaterials with high potentials for mine <b>soil</b> <b>reclamation</b> include zeolites, zero-valent iron nanoparticles, iron oxide nanoparticles, phosphate-based nanoparticles, iron sulfide nanoparticles and C nanotubes. Transport of these particles in the environment and their possible ecotoxicological effects are also discussed. Additionally, this article proposes a practical and economical approach to applying nanotechnology for mine soil reclamation: adding small amounts of nanoparticles to the conventional soil amendment materials and then applying the mixtures for soil quality improvements.

These parameters {{can be used for}} screening brown coals with respect to their suitability for <b>soil</b> <b>reclamation</b> purposes. Structural parameters, such as total cumulative volume, specific surface area, average pore radius, pore size distribution and total porosity were evaluated as a tool for the final selection of the suitable brown coal materials for reclamation purposes. The investigations were carried out using samples of brown coal from the opencast in Livno (Bosnia and Herzegovina) and brown coal material (BC 1) from the Konin (Poland) deposit. Samples were taken from different depths to evaluate the effect of depth on the studied properties. Based on results of S, C, N, ash, humic acids contents, it can be stated that the brown coal from Livno (BC 4) was the worst material {{to be used as a}} soil conditioner and/or for <b>soil</b> <b>reclamation</b> purposes. Brown coal samples from Livno were characterized by a very high acidity, thus in the case of their application for reclamation of soil contaminated with heavy metals, they have to be mixed with lime. The specific and bulk density of brown coal from Konin were lower than for brown coals from Livno.
