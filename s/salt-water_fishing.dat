40|$|When Henry B. Plant {{brought the}} {{railroad}} to Tampa in 1884, {{he opened the}} door for many businesses to locate and flourish here. The railroad {{was at the center of}} the city's economy. From downtown it went to Port Tampa where one could board a Plant steamship to Jamaica, Cuba, New Orleans, Bermuda or other destinations. A spur of the rail line brought the train up to the west front of the hotel so guests could depart the train and walk directly into the lobby. The Tampa Bay Hotel cost approximately 2. 5 million dollars to build and $ 500, 000 to furnish. Consisting of 511 rooms, some of which were suites of 3 - 7 rooms, it provided a degree of luxury never before seen in Tampa. Most of the rooms had their own baths and all had electricity and telephones. In addition, guests were surrounded by a varied collection of furniture, porcelains, Venetian-style mirrors, and sculptures gathered by Mr. and Mrs. Plant in their travels in Europe. The Tampa Bay Hotel opened in 1891 amid wide fanfare and celebration. Henry Plant's dream was now a reality. The newspapers of the day described it as "brightly illuminated, filled with sumptuous decorations, thrilling music and graced with turrets, domes and minarets towering heavenward and glistening in the sun. " It was a Victorian palace. The hotel was a lively place with balls, tea parties, and organized hunts during the winter social season. It was open seasonally from December to April in the 1890 's. Once a guest arrived at the hotel, he needed to be entertained. Guests went wild game hunting as well as fresh and <b>salt-water</b> <b>fishing.</b> Water sports were also included like sailing, rowing, and canoeing. For the less adventuresome, there were bicycles, carriages, and rickshaws to ride you around the property. The hotel also offered golf, tennis, shuffleboard, billiards, and even a racetrack.

Their bodies were white and silvery, and they had staring black eyes. They were not so large as the California flying-fish, nor did they have any blue color. They resembled the California species, however, in that same strange, hunted look which always struck me. To see these flying-fish this way was provocative of thought. They had been pursued by some hungry devil of a fish, and with a birdlike swiftness with which nature had marvelously endowed them they had escaped the enemy.

40|$|Cardiovascular health {{benefits}} associated with omega- 3 fatty acids have been well documented. Seafood is recognized as {{an excellent source of}} omega- 3 fatty acids in the diet. Consumer’s prize and purchase seafood as either fresh or “fresh frozen. ” Unfortunately, seafood is highly perishable with a 14 day shelf-life and techniques to extend shelf-life beyond frozen processing cause quality changes consumer’s will not accept. High pressure processing (HPP) may extend the shelf-life of seafood while maintaining the fresh-like characteristics consumers demand. However, HPP may promote the oxidation of omega- 3 fatty acids, thereby loosing seafood’s nutritional and market advantage. This research was to establish the effect of high-pressure conditions on fatty acid profile, to evaluate high-pressure on fish lipid from freshwater and <b>salt-water</b> <b>fish</b> species, to study high-pressure treatment on a purified fish lipid system, and to investigate high-pressure treatment on the activities of endogenous muscle pro- and antioxidants. HPP reduced bacterial numbers and improved shelf-life of seafood. Reductions of 3 - 6 logs were achieved with HPP and shelf-life could be extended. Lipid oxidation increased as pressure increased especially during storage over 3 - 6 days for all species tested. After HPP, fillets appeared as if they were cooked; although temperature during processing never went above 35 oC. This cooked appearance affected the surface color of the fillet with L-value and b-value increasing with pressure while a-value decreased. Overall, HPP shows promise in extending the shelf-life of seafood; however, {{further research is needed to}} control and understand lipid oxidation and color/appearance changes resulting from this process...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Six {{cases of}} Mycobacierium marinum infections of the deeper sfruc tures {{of the hand}} are {{described}} which clinically and histologically were indistin guishable from tuberculosis.

The organism must be suspected and then cultured at 30 to 32 degrees centigrade {{instead of the usual}} 37 degrees. Chronic infections of the hand can be a baffling problem to the treating physi cian as well as a disabling condition for the involved patient. Mycobacterium mar mum infections of the hand have been mistaken for gout, rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic pyogenic infections and are clinically and histologically indistinguishable from tuberculosis. One should have a high index of suspicion of Mycobacterium mar mum infections when there is a history of abrasion in contaminated water or a punc ture wound from marine life. The diagnosis should be established by culturing sus pect tissue on Lowenstein-Jensen's medium at 30 to 32 degrees centigrade rather than at 37 degrees centigrade (as for tuberculosis and other acid-fast bacilli).

60|$|It is {{probable}} that they are occasionally transported by what may be called accidental means. Thus fishes still alive are not very rarely dropped at distant points by whirlwinds; and {{it is known that}} the ova retain their vitality for a considerable time after removal from the water. Their dispersal may, however, be mainly attributed to changes in the level of the land within the recent period, causing rivers to flow into each other.

The wide differences of the fish on the opposite sides of most mountain-ranges, which are continuous and consequently must, from an early period, have completely prevented the inosculation of the river systems on the two sides, leads to the same conclusion. Some fresh-water fish belong to very ancient forms, and in such cases there will have been ample time for great geographical changes, and consequently time and means for much migration. Moreover, Dr. Gunther has recently been led by several considerations to infer that with fishes the same forms have a long endurance. <b>Salt-water</b> <b>fish</b> can with care be slowly accustomed to live in fresh water; and, according to Valenciennes, there is hardly a single group of which all the members are confined to fresh water, so that a marine species belonging to a fresh-water group might travel far along the shores of the sea, and could, it {{is probable}}, become adapted without much difficulty to the fresh waters of a distant land.|$|R

Data on mothers' milk FA and dietary habits which allowed food selection were recently published (Rocquelin et al., 1998). Most foods were locally produced. Food samples were collected at local markets, bleached if necessary to avoid microbial degradation, and stored at + 4 °C or - 20 °C. They were lyophilized upon their arrival in the laboratory before lipid analyses. FA composition of food lipids was determined by capillary gas chromatography. Staple diets included low-fat, high-carbohydrate foods (processed cassava roots, wheat bread) and high-polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) foods : soybean oil (high in 18 : 2 n- 6 and alpha- 18 : 3 n- 3), bushbutter (#Dacryodes edulis$), peanuts, avocado (high in fat and 18 : 2 n- 6), freshwater and <b>salt-water</b> <b>fish</b> (high in LC n- 3 and/or n- 6 PUFA) and leafy green vegetables (low in fat but very high in alpha- 18 : 3 n- 3). Their frequent consumption by nursing mothers provided enough EFA to meet requirements due to lactation. It also explains why mothers' breast milk was riche in C 8 -C 14 saturated FA (26 % of total FA) and in n- 6, n- 3 PUFA (respectively 15. 0 % and 2. 4 % of total FA) highly profitable for breasted infants' development. From this point of view, dietary habits of Congolese mothers have to be sustained for they are more adequate than most Western-type diets. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Recommendations about {{risks and}} {{benefits}} of seafood intake during pregnancy have been published in the last decade, but the specific health effects of the different categories of seafood remain unknown. Fish and shellfish may differ according to their fatty acid content and their concentration of chemical pollutants and toxins. Not taking these particularities into account may result in underestimating of both the positive and negative effects of seafood on birth outcomes and partly explains inconsistent results on the subject. Methods In the PELAGIE cohort study, including 2398 pregnant women from Brittany, we fit multiple linear and logistic regression models to examine associations of <b>fish</b> (<b>salt-water</b> <b>fish</b> only) and shellfish intake before pregnancy with length of gestation, birthweight, and risks of preterm births, low birthweight or small-for-gestational-age (SGA) babies. Results When fish and shellfish consumptions were considered simultaneously, we observed a decrease in the risk of SGA birth with increasing frequency of fish intake: OR = 0. 57 (95 %CI: 0. 31 to 1. 05) for women eating fish twice a week or more compared with those eating it less than once a month. The risk of SGA birth was significantly higher among women eating shellfish twice a week or more than among those eating it less than once a month: OR = 2. 14 (95 %CI: 1. 13 to 4. 07). Each additional monthly meal including fish was significantly related to an increase in gestational length of 0. 02 week (95 %CI: 0. 002 to 0. 035). No association was observed with birthweight or preterm birth. Conclusion These results suggest that different categories of seafood may be differently associated with birth outcomes, fish consumption with increased length of gestation and shellfish consumption with decreased fetal growth. </p...|$|R

60|$|But {{this power}} in fresh-water {{productions}} of ranging widely, though so unexpected, can, I think, {{in most cases}} be explained by their having become fitted, in a manner highly useful to them, for short and frequent migrations from pond to pond, or from stream to stream; and liability to wide dispersal would follow from this capacity as an almost necessary consequence. We can here consider only a few cases. In regard to fish, I believe that the same species never occur in the fresh waters of distant continents. But on the same continent the species often range widely and almost capriciously; for two river-systems will have some fish in common and some different. A few facts seem to favour the possibility of their occasional transport by accidental means; {{like that of the}} live fish not rarely dropped by whirlwinds in India, and the vitality of their ova when removed from the water. But I am inclined to attribute the dispersal of fresh-water fish mainly to slight changes within the recent period in the level of the land, having caused rivers to flow into each other. Instances, also, could be given of this having occurred during floods, without any change of level. We have evidence in the loess of the Rhine of considerable changes of level in the land within a very recent geological period, and when the surface was peopled by existing land and fresh-water shells. The wide difference of the fish on opposite sides of continuous mountain-ranges, which from an early period must have parted river-systems and completely prevented their inosculation, seems to lead to this same conclusion. With respect to allied fresh-water fish occurring at very distant points of the world, no doubt there are many cases which cannot at present be explained: but some fresh-water fish belong to very ancient forms, and in such cases there will have been ample time for great geographical changes, and consequently time and means for much migration. In the second place, <b>salt-water</b> <b>fish</b> can with care be slowly accustomed to live in fresh water; and, according to Valenciennes, there is hardly a single group of fishes confined exclusively to fresh water, so that we may imagine that a marine member of a fresh-water group might travel far along the shores of the sea, and subsequently become modified and adapted to the fresh waters of a distant land.|$|R

Otolith Ba:Ca of fish was correlated with ambient Ba:Ca. Using the natural relationships of increasing ambient and otolith Ba:Ca with decreasing salinity, fish from fresh- and salt-water environments were distinguishable. Fish caught in fresh water had approximately double the otolith Ba:Ca of those from salt-water estuaries, for both summer and winter collections. Fish with otolith Ba:Ca ≤ 5 µmol·mol– 1 were classified as resident in salt water, and those with ≥ 6 µmol·mol– 1 as resident in fresh water. Transects of Ba:Ca across fish otoliths classified fish to fresh- or <b>salt-water</b> environments. <b>Fish</b> were identified as having migratory patterns typical of residents, migrants with irregular patterns of diadromy, or migrants with cyclic patterns of anadromomy.

40|$|In {{countries}} such as Norway and the United Kingdom, <b>fish</b> farming of <b>salt-water</b> <b>fish,</b> especially salmon, has gained great economic importance in the past 10 to 15 years. A greater rate of cataract formation has been increasingly reported in salmon in these countries over the past 8 years. The increase in cataract frequency, however, cannot be explained using knowledge about fish lens physiology and morphology gained up until now. In the work presened here, the various stages of glycolysis in the fish lens (based on a determination of the specific activity of 5 enzymes in defined lens sections) were investigated using spectrophotometry. Using this methodology, {{it was possible to}} gain an initial insight into the metabolic physiology of the fish lens and the prerequisites for later investigations of possible cataract noxae could be defined. The metabolism of the lens of the salmon {{is similar to that of}} mammals. But, the enzyme activities measured in the fish lens are clearly lower than those found in the lenses of mammals. The lower enzyme activities may represent the expression of an adaptation to the surrounding water temperature. The relatively high LDH activity and PFK activity demonstrate that glycolysis takes place in the crystalline lens of the salmon. The lower PFK activities in the eyes of farm salmon with cataracts may show blockage of this enzyme due to excessive glucose or decoupling of glycolysis due, for example, to organic phosphates. G 6 P-DH provides an indication of the presence of a pentose phosphate pathway. Increased AR activity indicates a latent type II diabetes. This is present in normal lenses of farmed fish and cataract lenses and is an indication that salmon in fish farms is not able to cope with a constant excessive supply of food. Increased SDH activity with an only short-term WSS existing under stress may indicate a protective function. If a WSS takes up to much carbohydrate, then the SDH could work effectively in order to prevent an excessive accumulation of sorbitol. The salmon in fish farms, in contrast, only show low SDH activity, which is a sign of an inability to cope with the constant over supply of glucose. In contrast to wildsalmon, the salmon used for commercial breeding are on account of unnatural conditions (population density, excessive supply of food, light) under constant stress. The metabolism appears – with an already satisfied requirement – to go out of control. As an argument in favour of this hypothesis, the association of BMI (the ratio between height and weight) with frequency of cataracts in humans is cited. A damaging influence of the regular use of pesticides (organophosphates) on the crystalline lens is probable and will be specifically investigated in future studies. The lens appears to tolerate intra-ocular infections with parasites. This could be demonstrated by the absence of any influence of parasites on lens fresh weight (undisturbed tissue growth) or its transparency. In this study reference is made to testing triploid fish for breeding suitability and (osmotic) stress, pesticides, diet, temperature, UV light, oxidative processes, population density and growth speed lised as possible contributory factors to cataracts.

The total number of species include 16,000 species of insects (probably 4,000 more species yet to be described), 20,000 species of algae, 1,800 species of lichen, 1,050 species of mosses, 2,800 species of vascular plants, up to 7,000 species of fungi, 450 species of birds (250 species nesting in Norway), 90 species of mammals, 45 fresh-water species of <b>fish,</b> 150 <b>salt-water</b> species of <b>fish,</b> 1,000 species of fresh-water invertebrates and 3,500 species of salt-water invertebrates. About 40,000 of these species have been described by science. Scientific exploration in the summer of 2010 in Finnmark discovered 126 species of insects new to Norway, of which 54 species were new to science. The red list of 2006 encompasses 3,886 species. 17 species are listed mainly because they are endangered on a global scale, such as the European beaver, even if the population in Norway are not seen as endangered. There are 430 species of fungi on the red list, many of these are closely associated with the small remaining areas of old-growth forests. There are also 90 species of birds on the list and 25 species of mammals. 1,988 current species are listed as endangered or vulnerable as of 2006; of these are 939 listed as vulnerable (VU), 734 species are listed as endangered (EN), and 285 species are listed as critically endangered (CR) in Norway, among these are the gray wolf, the Arctic fox (healthy population on Svalbard) and the pool frog.|$|R
40|$|Vibrio anguillarum is the causative {{agent of}} vibriosis, a fatal hemorrhagic septicemic disease. V. anguillarum infects more than 50 fresh and <b>salt-water</b> <b>fish</b> species {{including}} various species of economic {{importance to the}} larviculture and aquaculture industry. In vibriosis, V. anguillarum invades its host fish through the intestine and skin. Infected fish usually die with systemic infection of V. anguillarum. Bacterial hemolysins are exotoxins that cause lysis of erythrocytes in the host and thus {{the release of the}} intracellular heme, and are therefore identified as important virulence factors. Moreover, hemolysins are known to also cause lysis in other cell types, including mast cells, neutrophils and polymorphonuclear cells. Two hemolysin gene clusters, vah 1 -plp and rtxACHBDE, have been previously identified and described. The activities of the protein encoded by the plp gene were not known. In the first manuscript, we describe the biochemical activities of the plp-encoded protein and its role in pathogenesis. The plp gene, one of the components in vah 1 cluster, encodes a 416 -amino-acid protein (Plp), which has homology to lipolytic enzymes containing the catalytic site amino acid signature SGNH. Hemolytic activity of the plp mutant increased 2 - 3 -fold on sheep blood agar indicating that plp represses vah 1; however, hemolytic activity of the plp mutant decreased by 2 - 3 -fold on fish blood agar suggesting that Plp has different effects against erythrocytes from different species. His 6 -tagged recombinant Plp protein (rPlp) was over-expressed in E. coli. Purified and re-folded active rPlp exhibited phospholipase A 2 activity against phosphatidylcholine and no activity against phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, or sphingomyelin. Characterization of rPlp revealed broad optimal activities at pH 5 – 9 and at temperatures of 30 - 64 °C. Divalent cations and metal chelators did not affect activity of rPlp. We also demonstrated that Plp was secreted using thin layer chromatography and immunoblot analysis. Additionally, rPlp had strong hemolytic activity towards rainbow trout erythrocytes, but not to sheep erythrocytes suggesting that rPlp is optimized for lysis of phosphatidylcholine-rich fish erythrocytes. Further, only the loss of the plp gene had a significant effect on hemolytic activity of culture supernatant on fish erythrocytes, while the loss of rtxA and/or vah 1 had little effect. However, V. anguillarum strains with mutations in plp or in plp and vah 1 exhibited no significant reduction in virulence compared to the wild type strain when used to infect rainbow trout. In the next manuscript, we used degenerate PCR to identify a positive hemolysin regulatory gene, hlyU, from the unsequenced V. anguillarum genome. The hlyU gene of V. anguillarum encodes a 92 -amino acid protein and is highly homologous to other bacterial HlyU proteins. An hlyU mutant was constructed, which exhibited ~ 5 -fold decrease in hemolytic activity on sheep blood agar with no statistically significant decrease in cytotoxicity of the wild type strain. Complementation of the hlyU mutation restored both hemolytic and cytotoxic activity. Both semi-quantitative RT-PCR and real time RT-qPCR were used to examine expression of the hemolysin genes under exponential and stationary phase conditions in wild type, hlyU mutant, and hlyU complemented strains. Compared to the wild type strain, expression of rtx genes deceased in the hlyU mutant while expression of vah 1 and plp was not affected in the hlyU mutant. Complementation of the hlyU mutation restored expression of the rtx genes and increased vah 1 and plp expression to levels higher than in the wild type. The transcriptional start sites in the intergenic regions of both vah 1 /plp and rtxH/rtxB genes were determined using 5 ’-RACE and the binding sites for purified HlyU was discovered using DNA gel mobility shift experiments and DNase protection assays. In the third manuscript, we identified the hns gene, which encodes the H-NS protein, and acts as a negative regulator of both gene clusters. The V. anguillarum H-NS protein shares strong homology with other bacterial H-NS proteins. An hns mutant exhibited increased hemolytic activity and cytotoxicity compared to the wild type strain. Complementation of the hns mutation restored hemolytic activity and cytotoxicity levels to near wild type levels. Further, expression of rtxA, rtxH, rtxB, vah 1 and plp increased in the hns mutant, and decreased in the complemented hns mutant strain when compared to the wild type strain. Additionally, experiments using DNase I, showed that purified recombinant H-NS protected multiple sites in the promoter region of both gene clusters. The hns mutant also exhibited significantly attenuated virulence against rainbow trout. Complementation of the hns mutation restored virulence to wild type levels, suggesting that H-NS regulates many genes that affect fitness and virulence. Previously, we showed that HlyU is a positive regulator of expression for both gene clusters. In this study, we demonstrate that up-regulation by hlyU is hns-dependent, suggesting that H-NS acts to repress or silence both gene clusters, and HlyU acts to relieve that repression or silencing. In the last manuscript, we aimed to create avirulent and immunogenic V. anguillarum strains that {{can be used as a}} live vaccine for fish, without knocking out any of the hemolysin genes. For this purpose, six genes (mdh, icd, sucA, sucC, sdhC, and fumA) encoding enzymes in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and one gene (cra) encoding a fructose metabolism repressor were identified and mutated in wild type V. anguillarum M 93 Sm (serotype O 2 a). Among all mutants, icd mutant showed high attenuation of virulence and lowest cell density limit in two forms of rich media. All mutants exhibited the same or higher levels of hemolysin gene expression compared to wild type during log phase. Further, fish that were pre-treated by immersion with icd mutant protected rainbow trout from the subsequent challenge of V. anguillarum M 93 Sm; and fish that were pre-treated with injection of the icd mutant elicited cross-serotype immunity against the subsequent challenge of V. anguillarum NB 10 (serotype O 1). The results suggest the TCA cycle mutation approach is likely to be an easy method to construct modified live vaccine for a wide variety of pathogenic bacteria...|$|R
