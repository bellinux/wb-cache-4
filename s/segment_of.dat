5|$|M-68 was {{designated}} along a <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> its current roadway in 1936. The roadway connecting Alanson and Indian River {{was given the}} M-68 designation, while US23 was routed between Rogers City and Afton. When US23 was moved to its current lakeshore routing between Rogers City and Cheboygan in 1940, M-33 was extended westerly from Onaway to Afton and north to Cheboygan over the former US23 roadway. The Afton–Onaway <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> M-33 and {{the remainder of the}} former US23 east of Onaway {{was designated}} as a second <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> M-68 as well. The gap between these two segments was eliminated by July 1946.|$|E

5|$|Another <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> freeway {{opened in}} 1987 in Clinton County between US127 near DeWitt and Temp. I-69 near Bath. This section was {{connected}} to the existing freeway at Perry in 1991. The final <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> I-69 to be completed was located southwest of Lansing. It opened on October 17, 1992, when the ribbon was cut by Governor John Engler. This segment marked the last in the state to complete Michigan's portion of the Interstate Highway System. At the time it was completed, I-69 was concurrent with US27 from the state line north to the DeWitt area (exit87) and then concurrent with US127 to exit89 before running alone to Port Huron.|$|E

40|$|The {{determination}} of intersection or contact points between objects in interference {{is not a}} simple task. It could be time-consuming in a computer application. Generally, some real time applications use sophisticated algorithms based on hierarchical structure to isolate the <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> contours of objects in interference, to finally compute locally the contact points. Therefore, we are interested in search for the best way of constructing hierarchical structures bounding objects that allows us to quickly isolate the contour <b>of</b> <b>segments</b> in interference. To achieve that, the bounding must be adapted and fitted to the <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> the objects contours. In this work, we formulate a method to represent, in hierarchic structure, oriented rectangle boxes involving <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> object contours defined by closed cubical B-splines curves. Each oriented box is computed in adapted and fitted form to the <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> the contour by using the second order statistical indicator on some elements <b>of</b> the <b>segments</b> <b>of</b> object contour in multi-resolution representation...|$|R
