It involves joint military exercises held among Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. Joint exercises and war games also been held with Brunei, China, Indonesia and the United States. Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam have agreed to host joint security force exercises to secure their maritime border and tackle issues such as illegal immigration, piracy and smuggling. Previously there are fears that extremist militants activities in the Muslim areas of the southern Philippines and southern Thailand would <b>spill</b> <b>over</b> <b>into</b> Malaysia. Due to this, Malaysia began to increase its border security.|$|E
5|$|In winter 546/7, {{when the}} new Byzantine {{governor}} and commander-in-chief, John Troglita, arrived in Africa, Cutzinas and his followers joined him, and participated in the expedition that saw the defeat and submission of Antalas. Shortly after, Cutzinas received the supreme Roman military rank of magister militum from Troglita. In the summer of 547 Cutzinas accompanied Troglita in his campaign against the Tripolitanian tribes under Carcasan. Before the Battle of Marta he advocated attacking the rebel forces, but the Byzantine army was heavily defeated by Carcasan and Antalas, who had once more risen in revolt. In the same winter, Cutzinas quarreled with another pro-Byzantine Berber leader, Ifisdaias. Their dispute threatened to <b>spill</b> <b>over</b> <b>into</b> open armed conflict, but the intervention of Troglita prevented this and the official John effected a reconciliation between the two.|$|E

25|$|By {{taking the}} Duchy of Milan and {{securing}} the Spanish realms in Italy, the Austrian Habsburgs had fulfilled their major war objective. Nevertheless, the Neapolitan campaign had been {{undertaken in the}} face of opposition from the Maritime Powers, who instead had favoured a diversionary attack on southern France. To assuage his allies Eugene, together with the Duke of Savoy, agreed to attack Toulon in July 1707, but the attempt proved ineffectual and Marshal Tessé thwarted all attacks. The Allies withdrew in August, though not before acquiring some advantage: the French squadron in the harbour had been permanently put out of action during the battle, leaving the Anglo-Dutch fleet uncontested in the Mediterranean. On the diplomatic front that year the Allies also had to contend with King Charles XII of Sweden, whose war against Russia and Saxony-Poland threatened to <b>spill</b> <b>over</b> <b>into</b> the War of the Spanish Succession. Charles XII had invaded Saxony in 1706, but the King had also threatened to interfere in Silesia on behalf of the Emperor's Protestant subjects, and there were fears that he might be inclined to assist the largely Protestant rebels in Hungary. However, once Joseph I had yielded enough concessions and signed the Treaty of Altranstädt on 31 August 1707, Charles XII turned his back on Germany in September, and headed east to Russia and to his eventual defeat at the Battle of Poltava.|$|E
500|$|Danish king Eric Evergood, {{concerned}} that the conflict would escalate, began peace talks between the two kings. Relations had been strained between Denmark and Norway after Magnus' 1096 raids into Halland, and Eric feared that the conflict might <b>spill</b> <b>over</b> <b>into</b> his own country. The three Scandinavian kings eventually agreed to negotiate peace in the border area near Göta älv. After a constructive meeting, they agreed to preserve ancestral borders; by marrying Inge's daughter Margaret (who acquired the byname Fredkulla: [...] "Colleen-of-Peace"), Magnus acquired the lands he claimed {{on behalf of his}} ancestors. Since the marriage was childless, Dalsland never became established as a Norwegian province and was returned to Sweden after his death.|$|E
500|$|In August 1987, the Armenian National Academy of Sciences {{started a}} {{petition}} to transfer Nakhichevan and Nagorno-Karabakh under jurisdiction of Armenia. In the nationalist movement to unite Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia, Armenians [...] "used {{the example of the}} slow [...] "de-Armenianization" [...] of Nakhichevan {{in the course of the}} twentieth century as an example of what they feared would happen to them." [...] During the Nagorno-Karabakh War, clashes occurred between Armenian and Azeri forces in the Nakhichevan-Armenia border, however, the war did not <b>spill</b> <b>over</b> <b>into</b> Nakhichevan. Turkey, Azerbaijan's close ally, threatened to intervene if Armenia invaded Nakhichevan. Nakhichevan was in center of attention during the destruction of the Armenian cemetery in Julfa in the 2000s. According to the Research on Armenian Architecture, most of the Armenian churches, monasteries and cemeteries were destroyed by Azerbaijan in the 1990s.|$|E

500|$|The {{site was}} largely {{preserved}} by the Spanish {{due to their}} alliance with the Kaqchikel against the K'iche'. The site’s central core is flanked by deep ravines and is separated from the main residential area by a defensive ditch. The city developed very quickly and within 50 years of its foundation it had reached its maximum extent. This explosive population growth at the city caused the residential area to <b>spill</b> <b>over</b> <b>into</b> {{the edges of the}} ravines themselves. The site center consists of four large and two small plazas, each of which contained at least two temples. [...] Along with elite palaces, there are two ballcourts, the larger of which is [...] long and had zoomorphic markers. The plazas are named A, B, C, D, E and F, running from northwest (A) to southeast (F). The ceremonial centre of the city was separated from the residential areas by a wall.|$|E
500|$|Academic Eliot A. Cohen, {{professor}} of strategic studies at Johns Hopkins University wrote for The Washington Post that the British Army had [...] "a higher quotient of sophisticated {{leaders who have}} thought hard about the profession of arms" [...] than was found in other armed forces, including the US military, which he believed explained why it [...] "produces generals who write [...] serious, important books" [...] such as the Utility of Force. Cohen wrote that Smith's thesis, {{that the world has}} entered a new era of conflict, is of [...] "central importance" [...] for the United States military, which Cohen believed would have to undergo significant adaptation if Smith was correct. Cohen criticised the book for its limited historical perspective, noting that conventional wars are still fought (for example the Kargil War in 1999) and that several confrontations in Asia threatened to <b>spill</b> <b>over</b> <b>into</b> conventional warfare. Nevertheless, Cohen concluded [...] "Smith has clearly written {{one of the most important}} books on modern warfare in the last decade. We would be better off if the United States had a few more generals like him".|$|E
500|$|Diabetic {{ketoacidosis}} arises {{because of}} a lack of insulin in the body. The lack of insulin and corresponding elevation of glucagon leads to increased release of glucose by the liver (a process that is normally suppressed by insulin) from glycogen via glycogenolysis and [...] also through gluconeogenesis. High glucose levels <b>spill</b> <b>over</b> <b>into</b> the urine, taking water and solutes (such as sodium and potassium) along with it in a process known as osmotic diuresis. This leads to polyuria, dehydration, and polydipsia. The absence of insulin also leads to the release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue (lipolysis), which are converted through a process called beta oxidation, again in the liver, into ketone bodies (acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate). β-Hydroxybutyrate can serve as an energy source in the absence of insulin-mediated glucose delivery, and is a protective mechanism in case of starvation. The ketone bodies, however, have a low pKa and therefore turn the blood acidic (metabolic acidosis). The body initially buffers the change with the bicarbonate buffering system, but this system is quickly overwhelmed and other mechanisms must work to compensate for the acidosis. One such mechanism is hyperventilation to lower the blood carbon dioxide levels (a form of compensatory respiratory alkalosis). This hyperventilation, in its extreme form, may be observed as Kussmaul respiration.|$|E

500|$|After {{returning}} to Australia, Wilton was appointed Brigadier in Charge of Administration at Headquarters Eastern Command, his first administrative post. In November 1955 {{he was assigned}} to the General Staff at AHQ, where he was responsible for intelligence, operations and plans, and took part in Australian preparations for SEATO exercises. He was promoted to major general on 24March 1957, and became Commandant of the Royal Military College, Duntroon. Although not strongly religious, Wilton considered himself responsible for the spiritual and moral development of younger cadets; he made a point of attending church parade regularly, and in 1959 personally launched an appeal for public funds to build the college's Anzac Memorial Chapel, which would open in 1966. His chief goal, though, was academic: concerned that graduates were at risk of falling behind their increasingly tertiary-qualified peers in industry and public service, he worked assiduously to make the college a degree-granting institution; this was realised in 1967. From June 1960 through 1962, Wilton was Chief of the Military Planning Office at SEATO Headquarters, Bangkok. He believed Thailand to be strategically vital, declaring [...] "if you want to hold Southeast Asia, you need to hold Thailand". His position allowed him to closely observe the deteriorating situation in Laos, which threatened to <b>spill</b> <b>over</b> <b>into</b> Thailand, and the Western Powers' growing focus on South Vietnam. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1962 Queen's Birthday Honours, in particular for his [...] "conspicuous devotion to duty and his singleness of purpose" [...] as Commandant of Duntroon. On 21January 1963, Wilton was promoted lieutenant general and became Chief of the General Staff (CGS), succeeding Lieutenant General Sir Reginald Pollard. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1964 New Year Honours.|$|E
