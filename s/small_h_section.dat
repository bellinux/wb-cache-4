40|$|Motivated {{by recent}} quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) {{simulations}} of the quantum Kagome ice model by Juan Carrasquilla, et al., [Nature Communications 6, 7421 (2015) ], we study the ground state properties {{of this model}} on the triangular lattice. In {{the presence of a}} magnetic field h, the Hamiltonian possesses competing interactions between a Z_ 2 -invariant easy-axis ferromagnetic interaction J_±± and a frustrated Ising term J_z. As in the U(1) -invariant model, we obtain four classical distinctive phases, however, the classical phases in the Z_ 2 -invariant model are different. They are as follows: a fully polarized (FP) ferromagnet for large h, an easy-axis canted ferromagnet (CFM) with broken Z_ 2 symmetry for <b>small</b> <b>h</b> and dominant J_±±, a ferrosolid phase with broken translational and Z_ 2 symmetries for <b>small</b> <b>h</b> and dominant J_z, and two lobes with m=〈 S_z〉=± 1 / 6 for <b>small</b> <b>h</b> and dominant J_z. We show that quantum fluctuations are suppressed in this model, hence the large-S expansion gives an accurate picture of the ground state properties. When quantum fluctuations are introduced, we show that the ferrosolid state is the ground state in the dominant Ising limit at zero magnetic field. It remains robust for J_z→∞. With nonzero magnetic field the classical lobes acquire a finite magnetic susceptibility with no S_z-order. We present the trends of the ground state energy and the magnetizations. We also present a detail analysis of the CFM. Comment: 13 pages with 19 figure...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT We have {{performed}} discontinuous molecular dynamic simulations {{of the assembly}} and folding kinetics of a tetrameric b-sheet complex that contains four identical four-stranded antiparallel b-sheet peptides. The potential used in the simulation is a hybrid Go-type potential characterized by the bias gap parameter g, an artificial measure of a model protein’s preference for its native state, and the intermolecular contact parameter h, which measures the ratio of intermolecular to intramolecular native attractions. The formation of the b-sheet complex and its equilibrium properties strongly depend {{on the size of}} the intermolecular contact parameter h. The ordered b-sheet complex in the folded state and nonaligned b-sheets or tangled chains in the misfolded state are distinguished by measuring the squared radius of gyration Rg 2 and the fraction of native contacts Q. The folding yield for the folded state is high at intermediate values of h, but is low at both small and large values of h. The folded state at <b>small</b> <b>h</b> is liquid-like, but is solid-like at both intermediate and large h. The misfolded state at <b>small</b> <b>h</b> contains nonaligned b-sheets and tangled chains with poor secondary structure at large h. Various folding pathways via dimeric and trimeric intermediates are observed, depending on h. Comparison with experimental results on protein aggregation indicates that intermediate h values are most appropriate for modeling fibril formation and <b>small</b> <b>h</b> values are most appropriate for modeling the formation of amorphous aggregates...|$|R
40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} {{using the}} radionuclide 22 Na as a solute tracer {{were conducted in}} microcosms containing the freshwater chironomid larvae Coelotanypus sp. and Chironomus plumosus and the mayfly larvae Hexagenia limbata to determine the exchange of solutes between sediments and overlying water. Three different mathematical models of transient solute transport in bioturbated sediments were applied to the data to evaluate which best quantified solute exchange and to determine how that exchange varied with fauna 1 type and density. Although all three species of larvae constructed burrows and irrigated them, the larger H. limbata frequently abandonded their burrows and vigorously burrowed the sediment. As a result, an enhanced diffusion model, in which the solute diffusion coefficient is higher in the bioturbated zone than in unmixed sediments, best described {{the data for the}} larger H. Zimbata. The enhanced diffusion model generally underestimated solute transport by <b>smaller</b> <b>H.</b> limbatu, C. plumosus and Coelotanypus sp. larvae because it did not account for the effects of burrow irrigation, Both the cylindrical burrow model and the nonlocal exchange model with a constant value of the exchange coefficient in the mixed layer described the transport processes well, presumably because the <b>smaller</b> <b>H.</b> limbata, C. plumosus, and Coelotanypus sp. maintained and actively irrigated their burrows. At natural bottom fauna 1 densities, C. plumosus induced the greatest exchange of solutes between sediment and overlying water, followed by the <b>small</b> <b>H.</b> limbata...|$|R
