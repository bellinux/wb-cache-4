5|$|However, in 2005 Katja Seipel and Volker Schmid {{suggested}} that cnidarians and ctenophores are simplified descendants of triploblastic animals, since ctenophores and the medusa stage of some cnidarians have <b>striated</b> <b>muscle,</b> which in bilaterians {{arises from the}} mesoderm. They did not commit themselves on whether bilaterians evolved from early cnidarians or from the hypothesized triploblastic ancestors of cnidarians.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle layer}} of the heart wall is the myocardium, which is the cardiac muscle – a layer of {{involuntary}} <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> tissue surrounded by a framework of collagen. The cardiac muscle pattern is elegant and complex, as the muscle cells swirl and spiral around the chambers of the heart, with the outer muscles forming a figure 8 pattern around the atria and around the bases of the great vessels, and inner muscles formining a figure 8 around the two ventricles and proceed toward the apex. This complex swirling pattern allows the heart to pump blood more effectively.|$|E
5|$|The panniculus carnosus is a {{layer of}} <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> deep to the panniculus adiposus. Although absent in hominoids, the panniculus carnosus is common in non-hominoid {{primates}} and non-primate mammals. In lower mammals {{the area of the}} panniculus carnosus can be extensive, almost covering the entire body {{in the case of the}} short-beaked echidna. Several human muscles are considered discrete muscles originating from the panniculus carnosus, and some researchers classify the axillary arch as a sporadic vestigial muscle of this type.|$|E
50|$|Invertebrates such as annelids, mollusks, and nematodes, possess obliquely <b>striated</b> <b>muscles,</b> {{which contain}} bands of {{thick and thin}} {{filaments}} that are arranged helically rather than transversely, like in vertebrate skeletal or cardiac muscles. In bivalves, the obliquely <b>striated</b> <b>muscles</b> can maintain tension over long periods without using too much energy. Bivalves use these muscles to keep their shells closed.|$|R

5|$|The {{function}} of TnI is to control <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> contraction and relaxation. Troponin I interacts with all major regulatory proteins in the sarcomeric thin filaments of cardiac and skeletal muscles: troponin C, troponin T, tropomyosin and actin. When cytosolic Ca2+ is low, TnI binds the thin filament {{to block the}} myosin binding sites on actin. The rise of cytosolic Ca2+ results in binding to the N-terminal domain of troponin C and induces conformational changes in troponin C and the troponin complex, which releases the inhibition of myosin-actin interaction and activates myosin ATPase and cross bridge cycling to generate myosin power strokes and muscle contraction.|$|E
5|$|The main {{muscular system}} in {{bivalves}} is the posterior and anterior adductor muscles, although the anterior muscles {{may be reduced}} or even lost in some species. These strong muscles connect the two valves and contract to close the shell. They work {{in opposition to the}} ligament which tends to pull the valves apart. In sedentary or recumbent bivalves that lie on one valve, such as the oysters and scallops, the anterior adductor muscle has been lost and the posterior muscle is positioned centrally. In file shells that can swim by flapping their valves, a single, central adductor muscle occurs. These muscles are composed of two types of muscle fibres, <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> bundles for fast actions and smooth muscle bundles for maintaining a steady pull.|$|E
5|$|The {{esophagus}} is {{innervated by}} the vagus nerve and the cervical and thoracic sympathetic trunk. The vagus nerve has a parasympathetic function, supplying {{the muscles of}} the esophagus and stimulating glandular contraction. Two sets of nerve fibers travel in the vagus nerve to supply the muscles. The upper <b>striated</b> <b>muscle,</b> and upper esophageal sphincter, are supplied by neurons with bodies in the nucleus ambiguus, whereas fibers that supply the smooth muscle and lower esophageal sphincter have bodies situated in the dorsal motor nucleus. The vagus nerve plays the primary role in initiating peristalsis. The sympathetic trunk has a sympathetic function. It may enhance the function of the vagus nerve, increasing peristalsis and glandular activity, and causing sphincter contraction. In addition, sympathetic activation may relax the muscle wall and cause blood vessel constriction. Sensation along the esophagus is supplied by both nerves, with gross sensation being passed in the vagus nerve and pain passed up the sympathetic trunk.|$|E
25|$|The {{muscular system}} of insects ranges {{from a few}} hundred muscles to a few thousand. Unlike {{vertebrates}} that have both smooth and <b>striated</b> <b>muscles,</b> insects have only <b>striated</b> <b>muscles.</b> Muscle cells are amassed into muscle fibers {{and then into the}} functional unit, the muscle. Muscles are attached to the body wall, with attachment fibers running through the cuticle and to the epicuticle, where they can move different parts of the body including appendages such as wings.|$|R
40|$|An {{attempt to}} explore {{urethral}} cytoarchitecture including {{the distribution of}} smooth muscles and fast and slow <b>striated</b> <b>muscles</b> of adult female Sprague Dawley rat [...] a popular model in studying lower urinary tract function. Histological and immunohistochemical stainings were carried out to investigate the distribution of urethral muscle fibers and motor end plates. The urethral sphincter was furthermore three-dimensionally reconstructed from serial histological sections. The mucosa at the distal urethra was significantly thicker than that of other segments. A prominent inner longitudinal and outer circular layer of smooth muscles covered the proximal end of urethra. Thick circular smooth muscles of the bladder neck region (urethral portion) decreased significantly distalward and longitudinal smooth muscles became 2 - to 3 -fold thicker {{in the rest of}} the urethra. An additional layer of <b>striated</b> <b>muscles</b> appeared externally after neck region (urethra) and in association with motor end plates ran throughout the remaining urethra as the striated sphincter layer. Most <b>striated</b> <b>muscles</b> were fast fibers while relatively fewer slow fibers often concentrated at the periphery. A pair of extraneous <b>striated</b> <b>muscles,</b> resembling the human urethrovaginal sphincter muscles, connected both sides of mainly the distal vagina to the dorsal <b>striated</b> <b>muscles</b> in the wall of the middle urethra. The tension provided by this pair of muscles, and in conjunction with the striated sphincter of the urethral wall, was likely to function to suspend the middle urethra and facilitates its closure. Comprehensive morphological data of urethral sphincter offers solid basis for researchers conducting studies on dysfunction of bladder outlet...|$|R

5|$|The muscular {{layer of}} the {{esophagus}} has two types of muscle. The upper third of the esophagus contains <b>striated</b> <b>muscle,</b> the lower third contains smooth muscle, and the middle third contains a mixture of both. Muscle is arranged in two layers: {{one in which the}} muscle fibers run longitudinal to the esophagus, and the other in which the fibers encircle the esophagus. These are separated by the myenteric plexus, a tangled network of nerve fibers involved in the secretion of mucus and in peristalsis of the smooth muscle of the esophagus. The outermost {{layer of the}} esophagus is the adventitia in most of its length, with the abdominal part being covered in serosa. This makes it distinct from many other structures in the gastrointestinal tract that only have a serosa.|$|E
5|$|The tentacles of cydippid ctenophores are {{typically}} fringed with tentilla ("little tentacles"), {{although a few}} genera have simple tentacles without these sidebranches. The tentacles and tentilla are densely covered with microscopic colloblasts that capture prey by sticking to it. Colloblasts are specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis, and have three main components: a domed head with vesicles (chambers) that contain adhesive; a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea; and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and {{is attached to the}} head and to the root of the stalk. The function of the spiral thread is uncertain, but it may absorb stress when prey tries to escape, and thus prevent the collobast from being torn apart. In addition to colloblasts, members of the genus Haeckelia, which feed mainly on jellyfish, incorporate their victims' stinging nematocytes into their own tentacles – some cnidaria-eating nudibranchs similarly incorporate nematocytes into their bodies for defense. The tentilla of Euplokamis differ significantly from those of other cydippids: they contain <b>striated</b> <b>muscle,</b> a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum Ctenophora; and they are coiled when relaxed, while the tentilla of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed. Euplokamis tentilla have three types of movement that are used in capturing prey: they may flick out very quickly (in 40 to 60milliseconds); they can wriggle, which may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms; and they coil round prey. The unique flicking is an uncoiling movement powered by contraction of the <b>striated</b> <b>muscle.</b> The wriggling motion is produced by smooth muscles, but of a highly specialized type. Coiling around prey is accomplished largely by the return of the tentilla to their inactive state, but the coils may be tightened by smooth muscle.|$|E
5|$|Muscle cells (myocytes) {{form the}} active {{contractile}} tissue of the body. Muscle tissue functions to produce force and cause motion, either locomotion or movement within internal organs. Muscle is formed of contractile filaments and is separated into three main types; smooth muscle, skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle. Smooth muscle has no striations when examined microscopically. It contracts slowly but maintains contractibility {{over a wide}} range of stretch lengths. It is found in such organs as sea anemone tentacles and the body wall of sea cucumbers. Skeletal muscle contracts rapidly but has a limited range of extension. It is found in the movement of appendages and jaws. Obliquely <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> is intermediate between the other two. The filaments are staggered and {{this is the type of}} muscle found in earthworms that can extend slowly or make rapid contractions. In higher animals striated muscles occur in bundles attached to bone to provide movement and are often arranged in antagonistic sets. Smooth muscle is found in the walls of the uterus, bladder, intestines, stomach, oesophagus, respiratory airways, and blood vessels. Cardiac muscle is found only in the heart, allowing it to contract and pump blood round the body.|$|E

40|$|Eight {{patients}} with traumatic transverse lesions of {{the spinal cord}} and eight healthy controls were examined {{with respect to the}} function of the anal sphincters.

The patients were more prone than the controls to display a cessation of all electrical activity from the <b>striated</b> <b>muscles</b> in response to rectal distension and they also exhibited a less pronounced inflation reflex. It is concluded that upon rectal distension in normal man the <b>striated</b> <b>muscles</b> are stimulated by a cerebral centre at an unconscious level as well as by a low centre of the spinal cord. The former accounts for an augmented inflation reflex and maintained or increased electrical activity when rectal distension is substantial. The smooth internal sphincter was found to be independent of cerebral influence at rest as well as during rectal distension...|$|R
25|$|It {{appears that}} paruresis {{involves}} a tightening of the sphincter and/or bladder neck {{due to a}} sympathetic nervous system response. The adrenaline rush that produces the involuntary nervous system response probably has peripheral and central nervous system involvement. The internal urethral sphincter (smooth muscle tissue) or the external urethral sphincter (<b>striated</b> <b>muscle),</b> levator ani (especially the pubococcygeus) muscle area, {{or some combination of}} the above, may be involved. It is possible that there is an inhibition of the detrusor command through a reflex pathway as well. The pontine micturition center (Barrington's nucleus) also may be involved, as its inhibition results in relaxation of the detrusor and prevents the relaxation of the internal sphincter.|$|E
25|$|The role of {{pelvic floor}} {{exercises}} and anal sphincter exercises in FI is poorly determined. While {{there may be}} some benefit they appear less useful than implanted sacral nerve stimulators. These exercises aim to increase the strength of the pelvic floor muscles (mainly levator ani). The anal sphincters are not technically part of the pelvic floor muscle group, but the EAS is a voluntary, <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> which therefore can be strengthened in a similar manner. It has not been established whether pelvic floor exercises can be distinguished from anal sphincter exercises in practice by the people doing them. This kind of exercise is more commonly used to treat urinary incontinence, for which there is a sound evidence base for effectiveness. More rarely are they used in FI. The effect of anal sphincter exercises are variously stated as an increase in the strength, speed or endurance of voluntary contraction (EAS).|$|E
25|$|Titin {{is a large}} {{abundant}} protein of <b>striated</b> <b>muscle.</b> Titin's primary {{functions are}} to stabilize the thick filament, center it between the thin filaments, prevent overstretching of the sarcomere, and to recoil the sarcomere like a spring after it is stretched. An N-terminal Z-disc region and a C-terminal M-line region bind to the Z-line and M-line of the sarcomere, respectively, so that a single titin molecule spans half {{the length of a}} sarcomere. Titin also contains binding sites for muscle-associated proteins so it serves as an adhesion template for the assembly of contractile machinery in muscle cells. It has also been identified as a structural protein for chromosomes. Considerable variability exists in the I-band, the M-line and the Z-disc regions of titin. Variability in the I-band region contributes to the differences in elasticity of different titin isoforms and, therefore, to the differences in elasticity of different muscle types. Of the many titin variants identified, five are described with complete transcript information available.|$|E
