500|$|Aki Ross's voice actor, Ming-Na Wen, was {{selected}} for a perceived fit between her personality and Aki's. Ming-Na, who found the role via her publicist, said {{she felt like she}} had given birth with her voice to the character. She gradually accustomed herself to the difficulty of working without the presence and spontaneity of real actors, and commented that the voice-acting work did not take much time, as <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> go into the studio [...] "once or twice a month for about four months" [...] with no need for make-up and costuming sessions. The workload was so light it did not interfere with her acting commitments in the television series ER.|$|E
500|$|Following pleas from Brown {{to resurrect}} Nick, John Altman {{returned}} to the serial again in December 2008, in a storyline that saw Nick attempt to con Dot again, this time aided by a previously unheard of daughter, Dotty (Molly Conlin). [...] Altman explained: [...] "Nick needed something, because I think if he didn’t have little Dotty, for him to walk through that door, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> have treated him as a complete outcast." [...] As the storyline progressed, {{it was revealed that}} Nick and Dotty had intentions to kill Dot for her inheritance; they concocted a plan to make her think she had developed dementia then overdose her with sleeping pills, which fails when Dotty has a change of heart and Nick flees once again after causing an explosion and being disowned by Dot.|$|E
500|$|The Florida Citrus Commission reiterated its {{commitment}} to Bryant by stating that it [...] "wholeheartedly support(ed)" [...] her right to free speech, praising her [...] "courageous leadership on a moral issue that it is tearing up religious and other organizations which have become involved". The commission received thousands of letters both supporting Bryant's stance and condemning the commission; {{at one point the}} U.S. Postal Service installed bomb detection equipment for the mail collected for delivery to the Florida Citrus Commission. The publicity director for the Florida Department of Citrus told a reporter from the Associated Press, [...] "The whole Anita thing is a mess. No matter what we decide, we're only going to lose. I wish <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> resign." [...] Although in 1979 the commission extended their $100,000 annual contract with Bryant, they did not renew it in 1980.|$|E

500|$|Poniewozik complimented the way [...] "Monteith really sold Finn’s {{feeling of}} being {{helpless}} and overmatched", and Canning said that Finn's reaction to Rachel's admission {{that she wanted to}} have sex because of the play was a [...] "solid and true moment". Rachel's reasoning, however, came in for harsh criticism: Brett Berk of Vanity Fair said it was [...] "neither believable nor even amusing" [...] that she would try intercourse for such a reason, Bell called her a [...] "dunce", and VanDerWerff didn't believe that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> blurt it out to Finn. The Star-Ledger Vicki Hyman felt her decision {{to go all the way}} did not [...] "ring quite true", and Poniewozik called it [...] "essentially pity sex". Ausiello had a different view—"I would hardly call it pity sex"—and West said she was [...] "going to choose to believe" [...] that Rachel did not have her first time [...] "just to make him feel better".|$|E
500|$|To {{adjust to}} {{potential}} audio feedback and leakage and obtain a usable take, Chavarria tried having Badu sit in an overstuffed chair six feet behind the mixing console and use alternate microphones {{such as a}} Neumann M 269 or AEA R44 ribbon microphone with Sony MDR-V900 headphones into a Furman headphone mixer. However, Badu felt she could not perceive all of her voice's frequencies with the headphones and often discarded them to move towards the studio monitors. He also considered situating her in an equilateral triangle with the two speakers, one {{of which would be}} placed out of phase in order to have the leakage cancel itself. However, according to him, the mic has to be stationary, while Badu [...] "likes to hold the mic like an MC. She is at home as a live performer." [...] He said of working around audio spills and adapting to Badu's methods, [...] "We worked to make her vocals fit into the track, phase-wise ... What did work was to keep the monitors fairly low and turn the microphone out of phase, and we would move her around the room until she found a spot where the leakage was reasonable and where she felt comfortable and could hear herself. But just as often <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> sit in that chair behind the board in the A Room." ...|$|E
500|$|Sotomayor's {{confirmation}} hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee began on July 13, 2009, {{during which she}} backed away from her [...] "wise Latina" [...] remark, declaring it [...] "a rhetorical flourish that fell flat" [...] and stating that [...] "I {{do not believe that}} any ethnic, racial or gender group has an advantage in sound judgment." [...] When Republican senators confronted her regarding other remarks from her past speeches, she pointed to her judicial record and said she had never let her own life experiences or opinions influence her decisions. Republican senators said that while her rulings to this point might be largely traditional, they feared her Supreme Court rulings – where there is more latitude with respect to precedent and interpretation – might be more reflective of her speeches. Sotomayor defended her position in Ricci as following applicable precedent. [...] When asked whom she admired, she pointed to Justice Benjamin N. Cardozo. In general, Sotomayor followed the hearings formula of recent past nominees by avoiding stating personal positions, declining to take positions on controversial issues likely to come before the Court, agreeing with senators from both parties, and repeatedly affirming that as a justice <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> apply the law. [...] On July 28, 2009, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved Sotomayor's nomination; the 13–6 vote was almost entirely along party lines, with no Democrats opposing her and only one Republican supporting her. On August 6, 2009, Sotomayor was confirmed by the full Senate by a vote of 68–31. [...] The vote was largely along party lines, with no Democrats opposing her and nine Republicans supporting her.|$|E

2500|$|Hepburn toured Central America in February 1989, and {{met with}} leaders in Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. In April, she visited Sudan with Wolders {{as part of a}} mission called [...] "Operation Lifeline". Because of civil war, food from aid {{agencies}} had been cut off. The mission was to ferry food to southern Sudan. Hepburn said, [...] "I saw but one glaring truth: These are not natural disasters but man-made tragedies for which there is only one man-made solution – peace." [...] In October 1989, Hepburn and Wolders went to Bangladesh. John Isaac, a UN photographer, said, [...] "Often the kids would have flies all over them, but <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> go hug them. I had never seen that. Other people had a certain amount of hesitation, but <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> grab them. Children would just come up to hold her hand, touch her – she was like the Pied Piper." ...|$|E
2500|$|Her {{students}} and friends spoke of her lessons in a reverent manner. Luana Haraguchi called Luahine her greatest influence and said, [...] "When she danced, she floated.

That was the dance class." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 2010, Kris Green from Digital Spy {{reported}} that Hassan would join Hollyoaks in August, {{as part of}} an ongoing rejuvenation of the serial. Series producer Paul Marquess believed that Lynsey and the other new characters he was introducing would bring [...] "more fun, drama and sexiness to the show". Hassan had not expected to be asked to join Hollyoaks and said it was an exciting, but scary prospect. The actress relocated to Liverpool for filming. Her character's introduction to Hollyoaks was low-key, which made Hassan believe that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> be kept in the background. She felt like Lynsey was [...] "kind of plodding along" [...] and asked the producer if he was happy with her work. He then revealed that he had been thinking along the same lines and told her that she would be a major part in an upcoming storyline featuring Silas Blissett (Jeff Rawle).|$|E

2500|$|Production {{went very}} well, and as {{expected}} {{with so many}} comic actors and personalities around, was very lively. During production, Hudlin said that whenever David Alan Grier and Martin Lawrence worked, the film's crew usually worked a little slower because wherever they were, there {{would be so much}} comedy being generated and they were so funny that everyone wanted to hang out near where they were throughout the day. In the scene where the new fragrance is being presented to Strangé, the director said that [...] "what Grace was doing on the set while we were shooting was so funny that I remember Halle crying off camera, cause she was trying to keep a straight face but she couldn't. So whenever she was off-camera, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> be literally crying because she was laughing so hard. And fortunately, for her reaction shots she was able to recover." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 2 October 2008 it was {{reported}} that Nick would return to EastEnders on Christmas Day that year after more than seven years away. Executive producer Diederick Santer spoke of his excitement at Nick's return, hailing the character as an [...] "EastEnders legend" [...] and [...] "one of the show's best-remembered and best-loved villains". Altman stated: [...] "After an absence of seven years, I am thrilled to return to Albert Square. The BBC have always given me great storylines as Nick Cotton and I look forward to seeing if Nick will once again spread fear and loathing throughout the Square!" [...] June Brown revealed that she had been asking producers to bring Altman back to the soap for 6 or 7 years, as the two of them share such a good working relationship. After spending time in Walsall, Cotton returns; walking normally again, and he is accompanied by his seven-year-old daughter, Dotty. He explained that he had met Dotty's mother Sandy while living in a squat, and that she was an alcoholic who had recently died, leaving him with custody of Dotty. Altman explained: [...] "Nick needed something, because I think if he didn’t have little Dotty, for him to walk through that door, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>just</b> have treated him as a complete outcast." [...] The actor described other changes to his character since his last appearance, detailing how he had become a plumber, begun dressing more smartly, stopped gelling his hair back and no longer wore an earring.|$|E
