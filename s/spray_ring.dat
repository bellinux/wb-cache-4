40|$|Second-throat {{diffusers}} {{serve to}} isolate rocket engines {{from the effects}} of ambient back pressure. As one of the nation's largest rocket testing facilities, the performance and design limitations of diffusers are of great interest to NASA's Stennis Space Center. This paper describes a series of tests conducted on four diffuser configurations to better understand the effects of inlet geometry and throat area on starting behavior and boundary layer separation. The diffusers were tested for a duration of five seconds with a 1455 -pound thrust, LO 2 /GH 2 thruster to ensure they each reached aerodynamic steady state. The effects of a water <b>spray</b> <b>ring</b> at the diffuser exits and a water-cooled deflector plate were also evaluated. Static pressure and temperature measurements were taken at multiple axial locations along the diffusers, and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were used as a tool to aid in the interpretation of data. The hot combustion products were confirmed to enable the diffuser start condition with tighter second throats than predicted by historical cold-flow data or the theoretical normal shock method. Both aerodynamic performance and heat transfer were found to increase with smaller diffuser throats. <b>Spray</b> <b>ring</b> and deflector cooling water had negligible impacts on diffuser boundary layer separation. CFD was found to accurately capture diffuser shock structures and full-flowing diffuser wall pressures, and the qualitative behavior of heat transfer. However, the ability to predict boundary layer separated flows was not consistent...|$|E

40|$|A unified {{computer}} {{model of the}} process of spray forming Inconel 718 rings has been developed. The target of the model is to optimize the process input parameters to achieve the correct shape, microstructure and minimum porosity. The model is divided in three main parts that correspond to the atomization phase of the material, the flight behaviour of the droplets and the solidification and growth of the ring. Different modelling techniques have been used for each part of the model. For the atomization step, stability analysis for the primary atomization and a tracking model for secondary atomization were used. Computational fluid dynamics calculations for the thermal and mechanical behaviour of the droplets in their travel to the substrate were used for the in-flight behaviour step. Shape and growth models, as well as thermal models, based on finite element calculations were used to predict the final shape and temperature history of the as <b>sprayed</b> <b>ring.</b> Various computer programs have been written to link results between different submodels and to transform the format of intermediate computer files...|$|R
40|$|Results are {{presented}} of observations of a waterspout funnel and <b>spray</b> <b>ring</b> performed under a cumulus line over the Great Salt Lake for about 5 min shortly after sunrise on June 26, 1985. These observations {{were used as}} the basis for a study of the initiation and evolution of waterspouts through a series of numerical experiments at two scales, that of a cloud and a waterspout. The cloud scale was simulated using an improved Goddard-Schlesinger model with nearby Salt Lake City soundings. Results showed that for each mode of cloud initiation, the vortex that started at the anticyclonic center grew faster than those started at other centers. This result strongly suggests that the cloud vorticity was important in its initiation. The greatest azimuthal speed for the bubble-initiated cloud was 11 m/s, when the vortex model was started at 28 -min cloud time with time-varying boundary conditions, whereas it was 21 m/s when started at 12 min in the line-initiated cloud. The results support the hypothesis that, at least in some circumstances, cloud processes alone can produce waterspouts in the absence of external vorticity sources such as surface convergence lines or other shear features...|$|E
40|$|The Waste Dislodging and Conveyance System (WD and CS) {{and other}} {{components}} of the Tank Waste Retrieval System (TWRS) were developed to address the need for removal of hazardous wastes from underground storage tanks (USTs) in which radiation levels and access limitations make traditional waste retrieval methods impractical. Specifically, these systems were developed for cleanup of the Gunite and Associated Tanks (GAAT) Operable Unit (OU) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The WD and CS is comprised {{of a number of}} different components. The three primary hardware subsystems are the Hose Management System (HMS), the Confined Sluicing End-Effector (CSEE), and the Flow Control Equipment and Containment Box (FCE/CB). In addition, a Decontamination <b>Spray</b> <b>Ring</b> (DSR) and a control system were developed for the system. The WD and CS is not a stand-alone system; rather, it is designed for deployment with either a long-reach manipulator like the Modified Light Duty Utility Arm (MLDUA) or a remotely operated vehicle system such as the Houdini{trademark}. The HMS was designed to act as a pipeline for the transfer of dislodged waste; as a hose-positioning and tether-management system; and as a housing for process equipment such as the water-powered jet pump that provides the necessary suction to vacuum slurried waste from the UST. The HMS was designed to facilitate positioning of an end-effector at any point within the 25 -ft- or 50 -ft-diameter USTs in the GAAT OU...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to establish whether commercial sources of dried blood meals available in New Zealand offer useful sources of digestible protein for chinook salmon. Three blood meals were evaluated to assess their suitability as ingredients in salmon feed. In vitro digestibility was determined using the pepsin and pronase digestibility assays. In vivo digestibility was determined by feeding diets to chinook salmon formulated to contain 20 % dried blood meal (batch dried, ring dried or spray dried), and 80 % of a basal diet and by correcting for the digestible protein supplied by the basal diet. Chromic oxide was included in the diets as an indigestible marker. The apparent digestibilities of crude protein and amino acids were determined based on samples of faeces collected after 7 days of feeding the respective test diet to chinook salmon. Feces were collected by a manual stripping of the hindgut. Crude protein contents were uniformly high, at 92. 0 %, 93. 1 % and 89. 6 % for the batch, ring and spray dried blood meals respectively. Amino acid contents were also generally high, with the exception of the essential amino acid methionine. All crude protein digestibility determinations ranked the blood meals as: spray dried > ring dried > batch dried. In vitro N digestibility values determined by pronase assay were 60. 5 %, 25. 5 % and 9. 0 % for <b>spray,</b> <b>ring</b> and batch dried bloods, respectively. The pronase assay yielded significantly (P< 0. 001) higher digestibility values than did the pepsin assay in the case of ring and spray dried blood meals, corresponding values for crude protein digestibility with the pepsin assay were 27. 8 %, 18. 9 % and 8. 4 % for <b>spray,</b> <b>ring</b> and batch dried bloods, respectively. The in vivo apparent faecal digestibility of protein in the dried blood meals determined in the chinook salmon were highest for the spray dried blood meal (68. 4 %), lower in ring dried blood meal (46. 3 %), and very low in the batch dried blood meal. The amino acid digestibilities were similarly ranked, with the difference between ring and spray dried blood meal being statistically significant for 9 of 17 assayed amino acids (P< 0. 05). A secondary aim of the study was an evaluation of the laboratory rat as a model animal for determining protein digestibility in the chinook salmon. Batch dried blood meal was fed to rats in an experimental design closely following that set for the chinook salmon, and the apparent digestibility of nitrogen and amino acids were determined based on sampling of ileal digesta. Ileal crude protein digestibility for this batch dried blood meal in the rat was also very low (3. 9 %), suggesting that the rat may be a suitable model animal for prediction of protein digestibility in chinook salmon. Differences in the protein digestibility of the blood meals appeared to be inversely related to the time spent in processing and drying. It appears that spray and ring dried blood meals may be suitable for inclusion in chinook salmon diets in partial replacement of fishmeal proteins.

40|$|This report {{documents}} the design, assembly, {{and operation of}} a Pilot-Scale Evaporator built and operated by SRTC in support of Waste Treatment Plant (WTP) Project at the DOE's Hanford Site. The WTP employs three identical evaporators, two for the Waste Feed {{and one for the}} Treated LAW. The Pilot-Scale Evaporator was designed to test simulants for both of these waste streams. The Pilot-Scale Evaporator is 1 / 76 th scale in terms of evaporation rates. The basic configuration of forced circulation vacuum evaporator was employed. A detailed scaling analysis was performed to preserve key operating parameters such as basic loop configuration, system vacuum, boiling temperature, recirculation rates, vertical distances between important hardware pieces, reboiler heat transfer characteristics, vapor flux, configuration of demisters and water <b>spray</b> <b>rings.</b> Three evaporation test campaigns were completed. The first evaporation run used water in order to shake down the system. The water runs were important in identifying a design flaw that inhibited mixing in the evaporator vessel, thus resulting in unstable boiling operation. As a result the loop configuration was modified and the remaining runs were completed successfully. Two simulant runs followed the water runs. Test 1 : Simulated Ultrafiltration Recycles with HLW SBS, and Test 2 : Treated AN 102 with Envelop C LAW. Several liquid and offgas samples were drawn from the evaporator facility for regulatory and non-regulatory analyses. During Test 2, the feed and the concentrate were spiked with organics to determine organic partitioning. The decontamination factor (DF) for Test 1 was measured to be 110, 000 (more than the expected value of 100, 000). Dow Corning Q 2 - 3183 A antifoam agent was tested during both Tests 1 and 2. It was determined that 500 ppm of this antifoam agent was sufficient to control the foaminess to less than 5 per cent of the liquid height. The long-term testing (around 100 hours of operation) did not show any fouling of reboiler or other loop piping. The Pilot-Scale Evaporator will be used in the Semi-Integrated Pilot Plant tests. Additionally, the Pilot-Scale design can easily accommodate hardware changes that result from the development of the full-scale evaporator to resolve any issues arising from the startup or operation of the full-scale facility...|$|R

40|$|Russian {{pulsating}} mixer pump (PMP) {{technology was}} identified in FY 1996 during technical exchanges between the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Tanks Focus Area Retrieval and Closure program, the DOE Environmental Management International Programs, and delegates from Russia as {{a technology that}} could be implemented in tank waste retrieval operations in the United States. The PMP is basically a jet mixer powered by a pressure/vacuum supply system. A prototype PMP {{was provided by the}} Russian Mining and Chemical Combine and evaluated as a potential retrieval tool in FY 1997 at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). Based on this evaluation, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and DOE staff determined that a modified PMP would meet project needs for bulk mobilization of sludge from {{one or more of the}} Gunite and Associated Tanks (GAAT) at ORNL. In FY 1998, PMP technology was selected for deployment in one of the GAAT to mobilize settled solids. Deployment of the PMP was expected to reduce operation and maintenance costs required to utilize more expensive retrieval systems. The following series of cold tests and inspections were conducted on one of the three PMP units provided to verify the acceptability and readiness of the mixing system for operation in the GAATs at ORNL: (1) Inspections and measurements designed to evaluate the integrity of the equipment: Fabrication shop inspections, Equipment inspections, Vibration/oscillation measurements, Hydrostatic pressure tests. (2) Functionality of the system components: Tank riser interface functionality, Decontamination <b>spray</b> <b>ring</b> (DSR) functionality, Valves, actuator, sensors, and control system functionality, Support fixture tests; and Contamination control assessment. (3) Mixing and operational performance of the PMP system: DSR performance, PMP debris tolerance, PMP performance with water only, PMP cleaning radius determination, and PMP performance with sludge surrogates. The results from these tests indicate that the PMP should be successful in mixing materials with characteristics similar to sand, kaolin clay, and gravel at moderate operating pressure in a 20 -ft-diam tank similar to the GAAT TH- 4. Minimum cleaning radii in the range of {approx} 5. 5 to {approx} 8 ft were observed. After various control system modifications and improvements, the PMP was successfully operated for several hours in the presence of both floating and submerged debris and various waste surrogates.

40|$|A testing {{facility}} (Cold Test Loop) was constructed and operated {{to demonstrate the}} efficacy of the Accelerated Waste Retrieval (AWR) Project's planned sluicing approach to the remediation of Silos 1 and 2 at the Fernald Environmental Management Project near Cincinnati, Ohio. The two silos contain almost 10, 000 tons of radium-bearing low-level waste, which consists primarily of solids of raffinates from processing performed on ores from the Democratic Republic of Congo (commonly referred to as ''Belgium Congo ores'') for the recovery of uranium. These silos are 80 ft in diameter, 36 ft high {{to the center of the}} dome, and 26. 75 ft to the top of the vertical side walls. The test facility contained two test systems, each designed for a specific purpose. The first system, the Integrated Test Loop (ITL), a near-full-scale plant including the actual equipment to be installed at the Fernald Site, was designed to demonstrate the sluicing operation and confirm the selection of a slurry pump, the optimal sluicing nozzle operation, and the preliminary design material balance. The second system, the Component Test Loop (CTL), was designed to evaluate many of the key individual components of the waste retrieval system over an extended run. The major results of the initial testing performed during July and August 2002 confirmed that the AWR approach to sluicing was feasible. The ITL testing confirmed the following: (1) The selected slurry pump (Hazleton 3 - 20 type SHW) performed well and is suitable for AWR application. However, the pump's motor should be upgraded to a 200 -hp model and be driven by a 150 -hp variable-frequency drive (VFD). A 200 -hp VFD is not much more expensive and would allow the pump to operate at full speed. (2) The best nozzle performance was achieved by using 15 / 16 -in. nozzles operated alternately. This configuration appeared to most effectively mine the surrogate. (3) The Solartron densitometer, which was tested as an alternative mass flow measurement device, did not operate effectively. Consequently, it is not suitable for application to the AWR process. (4) Initially, the <b>spray</b> <b>ring</b> (operated at approximately 2300 psi) and the nozzles provided by the pump vendor did not perform acceptably. The nozzles were replaced with a more robust model, and the performance was then acceptable. (5) The average solids concentration achieved in the slurry before Bentogrout addition was approximately 16 % by weight. The solids concentration of the slurry after Bentogrout addition ranged from 26 % to approximately 40 %. The slurry pump and ITL system performed well at every concentration. No line plugging or other problems were noted. The results of the CTL runs and later ITL testing are summarized in an appendix to this report...|$|E
5000|$|In {{traverse}} hardening systems {{the work}} piece is passed through the induction coil progressively and a following quench <b>spray</b> or <b>ring</b> is utilised. Traverse hardening is used extensively {{in the production of}} shaft type components such as axle shafts, excavator bucket pins, steering components, power tool shafts and drive shafts. The component is fed through a ring type inductor which normally features a single turn. The width of the turn is dictated by the traverse speed, the available power and frequency of the generator. This creates a moving band of heat which when quenched creates the hardened surface layer. The quench ring can be either integral a following arrangement or a combination of both subject to the requirements of the application. By varying speed and power it is possible to create a shaft which is hardened along its whole length or just in specific areas and also to harden shafts with steps in diameter or splines. It is normal when hardening round shafts to rotate the part during the process to ensure any variations due to concentricity of the coil and the component are removed.|$|R

40|$|Fabrication of a {{preliminary}} continuous Sigma 1140 + SiC fibre reinforced MoSi 2 composite monotape by plasma <b>spraying</b> onto a <b>ring</b> shaped substrate {{has been successfully}} demonstrated without any SiC breakage. The MoSi 2 matrix microstructure was typical of a splat quenched plasma spray processed material with porosity < 5 %. Matrix cracking occurred between fibres and was attributed primarily to differences in the {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} of MoSi 2, SiC and the steel substrate. Evidence for the formation of SiC by interfacial reaction between the fibre C coating and the MoSi 2 matrix has been observed, although this reaction was not uniform at all points on the interface. SIC formation has been suggested to affect the bonding between the fibre and the matrix and the subsequent mechanical properties of consolidated material. Pest oxidation bf the MoSi 2 matrix has been used to extract the SiC fibres after plasma spraying to assess the effect of process induced damage on the fiber properties in the matrix. However, the extraction process itself caused some changes to fibre properties which made analysis problematical. The similar to 3. 1 GPa as-supplied mean tensile fibre strength was retained during plasma spraying, but the Weibull modulus reduced from 25 to 11, i. e. the spread of fibre strengths increased. Mean bend strain and Weibull modulus were reduced from 1. 78 to 1. 57 and from 25 to 10 respectively. The fibre surface integrity was affected by both oxidation effects during extraction and by the impact of MoSi 2 droplets during spraying. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science S. A. All rights reserved...|$|R
