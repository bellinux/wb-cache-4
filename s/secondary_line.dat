On the second day, the 16th Infantry Brigade captured the township of Bardia, cutting the fortress in two. Thousands of prisoners were taken, and the Italian garrison now held out only in the northern and southernmost parts of the fortress. On the third day, the 19th Infantry Brigade advanced south from Bardia, supported by artillery and the Matilda tanks, now reduced in number to just six. Its advance allowed the 17th Infantry Brigade to make progress as well, and the two brigades reduced the southern sector of the fortress. Meanwhile, the Italian garrisons in the north surrendered to the 16th Infantry Brigade and the Support Group of the British 7th Armoured Division outside the fortress. In all, some 36,000 Italian prisoners were taken.|$|E
25|$|Many of the Marines of Task Force X-Ray {{had little}} or no urban combat experience, and the US troops were not trained for urban close-quarters combat, so this battle was {{especially}} tough for them. Due to Huế's religious and cultural status, Allied forces were ordered not to bomb or shell the city, for fear of destroying the historic structures. Also, since it was still monsoon season in that area of the country with heavy rain and low clouds on many days during the battle, it was virtually impossible for the U.S. forces to use air support. But as the intensity of the battle increased, the policy was eliminated. PAVN tactics were to hold the Marines close, negating the use of artillery and air support. A forward fighting line was maintained directly opposite the Marines with a <b>secondary</b> <b>line</b> 2 blocks back. Each building on the fighting lines was defended by snipers and machine guns, while spider holes were dug in gardens and streets, creating cross-fire between all buildings and streets. If the Marines penetrated the forward line the PAVN moved to the <b>secondary</b> <b>line</b> and then reoccupied the abandoned positions at night.|$|E

40|$|To {{systematically}} {{study the}} mechanical {{properties of the}} <b>secondary</b> <b>lining</b> for tunnels of the passenger dedicated lines(PDL), in-site monitoring is {{used to measure the}} contact pressures between the primary <b>lining</b> and the <b>secondary</b> <b>lining</b> for some typical tunnels of different Lines, such as Guiguang Line, Lanyu Line and Jinghu Line. According to the research, the contact pressure reaches its maximum value at the moment when the tunnel lining trolley is removed. The load acting on <b>secondary</b> <b>lining</b> is the actual deformation pressure, which is totally different from the loose pressure prescribed in Chinese tunnel criteria. The safety factor for <b>secondary</b> <b>lining</b> under the measured load is higher than that under the criteria load and satisfies the safety requirements. It is therefore possible for the primary lining to sustain the entire surrounding rock pressure with the help of necessary auxiliary method and suitable installation time. The result given in this research enhances our understanding towards the mechanical characteristics of <b>secondary</b> <b>lining</b> for the PDL tunnel and it will be helpful for <b>secondary</b> <b>lining</b> design.

500|$|Meanwhile, {{to support}} his weak right flank, Napoleon ordered Davout's III Corps to force march {{all the way from}} Vienna and join General Legrand's men, who held the extreme {{southern}} flank that would bear the heaviest part of the Allied attack. Davout's soldiers had 48 hours to march [...] Their arrival was crucial in determining the success of the French plan. Indeed, the arrangement of Napoleon on the right flank was very risky as the French had only minimal troops garrisoning there. However, Napoleon was able to use such a risky plan because Davout—the commander of III Corps—was one of Napoleon's best marshals, because the right flank's position was protected by a complicated system of streams and lakes, and because the French had already settled upon a <b>secondary</b> <b>line</b> of retreat through Brunn.

To accommodate a proper dispersal of stores, General Chase ordered an attack to expand the perimeter. An air strike was requested. B-25s of the 345th U.S. Bomb Group were intercepted by an estimated fifteen Japanese fighters. These were driven off by eight escorting P-47 Thunderbolt fighters, which claimed eight Japanese aircraft shot down. Two B-17s of the 69thU.S. Troop Carrier Squadron on a supply dropping run were also attacked, and claimed to have shot one of their attackers down. Two of the four B-25 squadrons dropped bombs in areas occupied by American troops, two of whom were killed and four wounded before the 12th U.S. Air Liaison Party could correct the error. Both squadrons of the 5th Cavalry attacked at 15:00. All objectives were taken and a new, larger defensive perimeter was prepared. The 40th Naval Construction Battalion had landed expecting to work on Momote airstrip. Instead, they were ordered to use their equipment to clear fields of fire and construct fortifications, and were given a section of the perimeter to defend.
