25|$|Journalist Kevin Toolis {{states that}} from 1985 onward, the IRA {{carried out a}} five-year {{campaign}} against RUC and Army bases that resulted in 33 British <b>security</b> <b>facilities</b> destroyed and nearly a hundred seriously damaged. The attacks and bombings in the early 1990s forced the UK government to dismantle several bases and security posts, whose maintenance or reconstruction was not affordable. The presence of the British Army in the region increased from its lowest ebb of 9,000 men in 1985 to 10,500 by 1992 after an escalation of the IRA's mortar attacks.|$|E
25|$|Terminal D and Terminal E were {{upgraded}} in late 2008 {{with a new}} concourse {{connecting the}} two terminals while providing combined security, a variety of shops and restaurants and a link between Baggage Claims D and E.

This is the inverse of the connector between Terminals B and C, which comprises a combined ticket hall but separate <b>security</b> <b>facilities.</b> Terminal D is home to Air Canada, Alaska Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, and Virgin America. This terminal {{is connected to the}} shopping area of Terminals B/C through a post-security walkway.|$|E

Vehicle checks are done by the police when they enter the carparks. The overhead bridge from CityLink Mall to Suntec City has been closed to the public for the meetings. A security office has been temporarily built at the main entrance of Suntec City Mall with metal detectors and x-ray machines being installed, and other <b>security</b> <b>facilities.</b> These machines have also been installed at SICEC for the delegates and CSO protestors.|$|E

50|$|Increasing {{violence}} of some detainees created {{a need for}} a facility where inmates with a high risk of violence could be securely detained.

2500|$|Prisoners in minimum <b>security</b> <b>facilities</b> are {{considered}} to pose little physical risk {{to the public and}} are mainly non-violent [...] "white collar criminals". Minimum security prisoners live in less-secure dormitories, which are regularly patrolled by correctional officers. As in medium <b>security</b> <b>facilities,</b> they have communal showers, toilets, and sinks. A minimum-security facility generally has a single fence that is watched, but not patrolled, by armed guards. At facilities in very remote and rural areas, there may be no fence at all. Prisoners may often work on community projects, such as roadside litter cleanup with the state department of transportation or wilderness conservation. Many minimum <b>security</b> <b>facilities</b> are small camps located in or near military bases, larger prisons (outside the security perimeter) or other government institutions to provide a convenient supply of convict labor to the institution. Many states allow persons in minimum-security facilities access to the Internet.|$|E
2500|$|The {{threat of}} {{violence}} is a constant distraction at DJJ facilities. [...] In 2004, a six-month investigation by the San Jose Mercury News uncovered deep systemic flaws, concluding that violence was predominant, gangs ruled, and fear was pervasive. [...] The Mercury News reported that, at any given time, dozens of young men are held in isolation cells for fighting or other offenses at the state's two maximum <b>security</b> <b>facilities,</b> and that wards sometimes threw human waste, blood or semen through the slots in their cell doors.|$|E

Terminal 2's current capacity is around 8million passengers a year, this will be extended to ultimately handle 25million passengers a year.

2500|$|A rebel unit of army defectors {{launched}} a major offensive against <b>security</b> <b>facilities</b> in Syria’s largest city of Aleppo, and anti-regime forces targeted air bases {{to try to}} reduce the military threat from the skies, activists said. LCC said rebels shot down a helicopter {{in the town of}} Sarmin (Coordinates: [...] ), in the northeastern province of Idlib. An activist in the area also reported a helicopter was downed. Fighting continued elsewhere in Syria on that day, including Damascus, where intense battles have been raging for more than a month. The Observatory and the Local Coordination Committees also reported clashes and shelling between troops and rebels in the southern province of Daraa and the central region of Homs. By late of the day, the observatory said as many as 100 people were killed across Syria. The Free Syria Army has warned airlines to suspend service to Damascus and Aleppo, saying rebel forces could begin attacking airports in the two cities as early as next week.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1980s, the IRA in East Tyrone {{and other}} areas close to the border, such as South Armagh, were {{following}} a Maoist military theory devised for Ireland by Jim Lynagh, a high-profile member of the IRA in East Tyrone (but a native of County Monaghan). The theory involved creating [...] "no-go zones" [...] that the British Army and Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) did not control and gradually expanding them. Lynagh's strategy was {{to start off with}} one area which the British military did not control, preferably a republican stronghold such as east Tyrone. The South Armagh area was considered to be a liberated zone already, since British troops and the RUC could not use the roads there for fear of roadside bombs and long-range harassing fire. Thus it was from there that the IRA East Tyrone Brigade attacks were launched, with most of them occurring in east Tyrone in areas close to south Armagh, which offered good escape routes. The first phase of Lynagh's plan to drive out the British security forces from east Tyrone involved destroying isolated rural police stations and then intimidating or killing any building contractors who were employed to rebuild them. Lynagh's plans met strong criticism from senior brigade member Kevin McKenna, who regarded the strategy as [...] "too impractical, too ambitious, and not sustainable" [...] per journalist Ed Moloney. The IRA Northern Command, however, approved a scaled-down version of the strategy, aimed at hampering the repair and refurbishment of British security bases. Scottish-born journalist Kevin Toolis has written that from 1985 onward, the brigade led a five-year campaign that left 33 <b>security</b> <b>facilities</b> destroyed and nearly 100 seriously damaged.|$|E
