5|$|By the 11th century {{mainland}} southern Longobard and Byzantine {{powers were}} hiring Norman mercenaries, who were {{descendants of the}} Vikings; it was the Normans under Roger I who conquered <b>Sicily,</b> taking {{it away from the}} Arab Muslims. After taking Apulia and Calabria, Roger occupied Messina with an army of 700 knights. In 1068, Roger I of <b>Sicily</b> and his men defeated the Muslims at Misilmeri but the most crucial battle was the siege of Palermo, which led to <b>Sicily</b> being completely under Norman control by 1091.|$|E
5|$|In 1735, Naples and <b>Sicily</b> were reconquered by King Philip V of Spain, a Bourbon, who {{installed}} {{his younger}} son, Duke Charles of Parma, as King CharlesVII of Naples and <b>Sicily,</b> starting a cadet {{branch of the}} house of Bourbon. In 1799 Napoleon conquered Naples, governed by FerdinandIV of Naples (later FerdinandI of the Two Sicilies) at the time. It was formed into the Parthenopaean Republic with French support. Under British pressure, especially from Lord William Bentinck, who was commander of British troops in <b>Sicily,</b> Naples was then handed back to Ferdinand, being forced to create a constitution for the Kingdom of <b>Sicily.</b> The island was under British occupation from 1806-14.|$|E
5|$|In 550, Artabanes was {{appointed}} magister militum per Thracias {{and sent to}} replace the aged senator Liberius in command of an expedition under way against <b>Sicily,</b> which had recently been overrun by the Ostrogoth king Totila. Artabanes failed {{to catch up with}} the expedition before it sailed for <b>Sicily,</b> and his own fleet was driven back and scattered by severe storms in the Ionian Sea. Eventually he arrived in <b>Sicily</b> and took command of the Byzantine forces there. He besieged the Gothic garrisons left behind by Totila after he left the island and soon forced them to surrender. Over the next two years, he remained in <b>Sicily.</b> According to Procopius, the inhabitants of the mainland city of Croton, which was being besieged by the Goths, repeatedly sent to him for help, but he did nothing.|$|E

5|$|Kesselring flew to <b>Sicily</b> {{himself on}} 12 July {{to survey the}} {{situation}} and decided that {{no more than a}} delaying action was possible and that the island would eventually have to be evacuated. Nonetheless, he intended to fight on and he reinforced <b>Sicily</b> with the 29th Panzergrenadier Division on 15 July. Kesselring returned to <b>Sicily</b> by flying boat on 16 July to give the senior German commander, General der Panzertruppe Hans-Valentin Hube, his instructions. Unable to provide much more in the way of air support, Kesselring gave Hube command of the heavy flak units on the island, although this was contrary to Luftwaffe doctrine. In all, Kesselring managed to delay the Allies in <b>Sicily</b> for another month and the Allied conquest of the <b>Sicily</b> was not complete until 17 August.|$|E
5|$|On 9 July the Allies invaded <b>Sicily</b> in Operation Husky.

5|$|The First Punic War {{began in}} 264BC when {{inhabitants}} of <b>Sicily</b> began {{to appeal to}} the two powers between which they lay—Rome and Carthage—to resolve internal conflicts.

5|$|Under the Kingdom, Sicily's {{products}} went to {{many different}} lands. Among these were Genoa, Pisa, the Byzantine Empire, and Egypt. Over {{the course of}} the 12th century, <b>Sicily</b> became an important source of raw materials for north Italian cities such as Genoa. As the centuries went on, however, this economic relationship became less advantageous to <b>Sicily,</b> and some modern scholars see the relationship as frankly exploitative. Furthermore, many scholars believe that <b>Sicily</b> went into decline in the late Middle Ages, though they are not agreed on when this decline occurred. Clifford Backman argues that {{it is a mistake to}} see the economic history of <b>Sicily</b> in terms of victimization, and contends that the decline really began in the second part of the reign of Frederick III, in contrast to earlier scholars who believed that Sicilian decline had set in earlier. Where earlier scholars saw late medieval <b>Sicily</b> in continuous decline, Stephen Epstein argued that Sicilian society experienced something of a revival in the 15th century.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{had been}} formed in October 1941, the British 1st Airborne Division, {{commanded}} by Major-General George Hopkinson, had never before fought as a complete division. The only units with any combat experience were the 1st Parachute Brigade, which had fought with distinction as an independent brigade in North Africa and in Operation Fustian during the Allied invasion of <b>Sicily,</b> and the 1st Airlanding Brigade, understrength with only two battalions, which had also fought in <b>Sicily</b> during Operation Ladbroke. Both brigades had suffered heavy casualties in <b>Sicily</b> and were in no condition to undertake any further assault landings. Of the division's other brigades, the 2nd and 4th Para Brigades, were untried in battle. Also, the 2nd Parachute Brigade was the only full strength unit, as the 4th Parachute Brigade had only two battalions, with its third battalion still forming in Palestine.|$|E
5|$|Another {{reason for}} the gradual decline in the {{development}} of Sicily's Baroque and building in general was that the money was running out. During the 17th century, the aristocracy had lived principally on their landed estates, tending and improving them, and as a result their income also increased. During the 18th century, the nobility gradually migrated towards the cities, in particular Palermo, to enjoy the social delights of the Viceroy's court and Catania. Their town palazzi grew in size and splendour, {{to the detriment of the}} abandoned estates, which were still expected to provide the revenue. The land agents left to run the estates over time became less efficient, or corrupt, often both. Consequently, aristocratic incomes fell. The aristocracy borrowed money using the estates as surety, until the value of the neglected estates fell below the money borrowed against them. Moreover, <b>Sicily</b> was by now as unstable politically as its nobility were financially. Ruled from Naples by the weak Ferdinand IV and his dominant wife, <b>Sicily</b> had declined to the point of no return long before 1798 and again in 1806 when the King was forced by the invading French to flee Naples to <b>Sicily.</b> The French were kept at bay from <b>Sicily</b> only by an expeditionary force of 17,000 British troops, and <b>Sicily</b> was now ruled by Britain in effect if not in name. King Ferdinand then in 1811 imposed the first taxes, at a single stroke alienating his aristocracy.|$|E

5|$|From 872 to 877 {{there was}} {{apparently}} {{a period of}} calm, since the sources are silent on any military operations in <b>Sicily.</b> This was probably chiefly due to internal turmoil in Muslim <b>Sicily,</b> with six governors reported as having taken office during this period, {{as well as the}} weakness of the Aghlabid government on the Ifriqiyan metropolis.

5|$|From {{its initial}} origins in Eastern <b>Sicily,</b> {{especially}} in Catania, the movement got its real impetus {{with the establishment}} of the Fascio of Palermo on June 29, 1892.

5|$|Henry did {{not give}} up on his hopes for a crusade, but became {{increasingly}} absorbed {{in a bid to}} acquire the wealthy Kingdom of <b>Sicily</b> for his son Edmund. <b>Sicily</b> had been controlled by Frederick II of the Holy Roman Empire, for many years a rival of Pope Innocent IV. On Frederick's death in 1250, Innocent started to look for a new ruler, one more amenable to the Papacy. Henry saw <b>Sicily</b> as both a valuable prize for his son and as an excellent base for his crusading plans in the east. With minimal consultation within his court, Henry came to an agreement with the Pope in 1254 that Edmund should be the next king. Innocent urged Henry to send Edmund with an army to reclaim <b>Sicily</b> from Frederick's son Manfred, offering to contribute to the expenses of the campaign.|$|E
5|$|In 1282, {{a revolt}} against Angevin rule, {{known as the}} Sicilian Vespers, threw off Charles of Anjou's rule of the island of <b>Sicily.</b> The Angevins managed to {{maintain}} control in the mainland part of the kingdom, which became a separate entity also styled Kingdom of <b>Sicily,</b> although it is {{commonly referred to as}} the Kingdom of Naples, after its capital.
