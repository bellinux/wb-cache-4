5000|$|The {{vertical}} travel lead, {{referred to as}} [...] "VTL" [...] system, was first developed and patented by C.W. Bermingham in the 1970s. This lead system was developed {{in response to the}} fundamental limitations of either a fixed lead or swinging lead system. The fixed lead system is well suited to level job sites with few obstructions and has the advantage of faster positioning of the lead. The hanging lead is very adaptable to different elevations and batter piles but takes much longer to position. The Vertical Travel Lead was developed to combine the fast and accurate positioning of fixed leads, with the ability to adjust the height of the lead base up or down. The VTL lead is connected to the boom by a <b>sliding</b> <b>connection,</b> which allows the lead to be elevated or lowered below grade. The VTL system has become the industry standard in Canada, US Railway Construction, and many parts of the USA. Vertical Travel Leads come in two main forms: Spud and Box Lead types. Box leads are very common in the Southern United States and Spud Leads are common in the Northern United States, Canada and Europe.|$|E

5000|$|Slip joints {{in large}} {{structures}} {{are used to}} allow independent motion of large components while enabling them to be joined in some way. For example, if two tall buildings are to be joined with a pedestrian skyway at some high level, there are two options in structural engineering. If the buildings are identical in mass and elasticity they will tend to respond similarly to ground motion induced by earthquakes. In this case it may be appropriate to construct a rigid connection between the buildings, although this may require additional supporting members within the structures. On the other hand, a lower cost connection may be made by using a lightweight structure that is not coupled rigidly but instead which is allowed to slide or [...] "float" [...] relative to one or both structures. This is especially suitable where the two structures may respond differently to ground motion. The structure will not be completely free to move but rather may use elastic materials to locate it {{near the center of}} its range of motion and viscous shock absorbers to absorb energy and to restrict the speed of relative motion. When a <b>sliding</b> <b>connection</b> is used it is extremely important that there be sufficient range of motion without failure to accommodate the maximum credible relative motion of the structures.

In the two versions, for vertical and horizontal panels, the out-of-plane force is axial and shear, respectively. A uniaxial test setup with application of constant axial or shear force has been realized, with the possibility to slide with very low friction on mechanical linear guides. The tests show that the connection is able to slide even under the constant application of the maximum out-of-plane load with stable hysteretic cycles, and static and dynamic friction coefficients have been experimentally evaluated. Such coefficients are useful in the design phase, especially regarding the panel-to-foundation connection, which is normally conceived as clamped to avoid geometric changes due to rocking of the panel.

40|$|Two {{full-scale}} architectural {{precast concrete}} (APC) panels {{were tested in}} 2011 on a full-scale five-story steel frame building at the E-Defense shake table facility in Miki, Japan. The panels were designed according to common U. S. practice. The main issues evaluated were: 1) the effect of acceleration on the APC panels, and 2) {{the effectiveness of the}} current slotted-bolt <b>sliding</b> <b>connection</b> to allow for inter-story earthquake motion. The testing represented one type of standard US APC façade design where the APC panel is designed to accommodate inter-story drift through rocking. Instrumentation measured the acceleration of the panels and floors as well as the movement of the slotted connections. The difference between the inter-story drift at the center and corner of the building was large enough to suggest that it may be inaccurate to consider the drift at the floor center to be the same as the drift at the actual panel location, when trying to predict the behavior of an APC panel. Neither panel experienced damage at maximum recorded inter-story deflections of 13. 1 and 22. 7 mm (maximum out-of-plane and in-plane deflections). Displacement and acceleration data from instruments placed on the panels themselves suggest a possible correlation between vertical acceleration recorded on the APC panel and the occurrence of uplift at the base slotted connection (possible rocking). Acceleration amplification ratios were developed as well...|$|E
40|$|Nonstructural {{failures}} have {{accounted for}} the majority of earthquake damage in several recent earthquakes. Thus, it is critical to raise awareness of potential nonstructural risks, the costly consequences of nonstructural failures, and the opportunities that exist to limit future losses. Non-structural parts of a building have the potential to modify earthquake response of the primary structure in an unplanned way. This can lead to severe structural damage or even collapse. Failure of non-structural components may cause death or injury from: Falling panels, masonry or glass, collapsed ceiling components, falling fittings and fixtures, debris blocking exit ways, etc. The configuration of a building could be called its seismic form. An obvious example of poor seismic configuration is a U or L shaped building on plan, if it is not structurally divided into simply shaped blocks. Such a building may suffer damage in an earthquake because the ‘free’ ends on plan will sway in a different way to the corner section, which is stiffer. Columns on re-entrant corners are particularly prone to damage because of the concentration of forces at such points. Therefore should be avoided in the design: irregular configuration, soft-storey, asymmetrical horizontal bracing, short pillars, etc. so as to properly distribute the stresses. Of course, an important starting point in the study and evaluation of this topic is the consideration and the comparison of several local regulations and their approach to the seismic design of non-structural elements. The reason of the importance of considering and evaluating the possible differences among different approaches to the same problem is clearly understandable. These national regulations represent the expression of the “state of the art” about this topic of a specific country or region of the world. In this project analyzes regulations as: European regulation (Eurocode 8), American regulation (ASCE 7 - 10), New Zealand regulation (NZS 1170. 5), Japan regulation and Spanish Regulation (NCSE- 02). Finally we focus on a specific non-structural element such as the facades. Facade systems can be categorized by three main types; infill panels, cladding and a combination of the two. In general, infill panels are constructed within the frame of the structure and cladding facades are attached externally to the primary structure. Each facade system will behave in a particular way when subjected to inter-storey drift. It is important to understand how each facade system behaves in order to determine which parameters are important for the performance based design. How a facade system is connected to the primary structure is the critical aspect in determining the interaction between the two systems. The current practice in seismically active countries such as Japan, USA and New Zealand is to separate the facade system from the frame. For infill panels this is most commonly done using a seismic (or separation) gap between the wall and frame. Similarly to seismic gaps, the interaction between cladding systems and the frame can be minimized using movement connections. These connections commonly consist of a fixed and <b>sliding</b> <b>connection</b> which allows the cladding panels to move and rotate relative to the frame when undergoing seismic excitation. Another possible solution is use of a relative displacement between facade and structure. Facade systems can be integrated with energy dissipative connections that are designed to yield before the facade yields. Finally, having a complete integration of the facade system is often an effective strategy to reduce the drift of a structure because of the additional stiffness provided by the façade. Finally, we analyze a masonry wall brick through a computer application that is based on the finite element method. We analyze a concrete masonry wall (the properties of each masonry wall vary depending on the individual parameters of the masonry and the connection between them) and adjust the model to obtain the stress distribution maps, compare the results with the Spanish regulation (CTE) and to draw conclusions. See as, masonry is a material designed to resist vertical loads, one of the principal factors must be considered in the design is the compressive strength. However, these structures are affected by other actions, such as earthquakes loads, which translate into horizontal forces. This requires considering the shear strength and tensile strength of the masonry. Escuela de Arquitectura e Ingeniería de EdificaciónUniversidad Politécnica de Cartagen...|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{this study}} a total lagrangian 2 D finite element {{formulation}} {{is used to}} model plane frames developing large displacements and rotations considering <b>sliding</b> <b>connections.</b> This kind of connections is usually called prismatic and cylindrical joints. In order to be self-containing, {{the steps of the}} development of a frame finite element of any approximation order that considers the influence of shear strain by means of a generalized Reissner kinematics is presented. The adopted degrees of freedom are positions and rotations. Using positions as degrees of freedom simplifies the total lagrangian description and enables a comprehensive presentation of the proposed connections. Revolute connections are considered by direct degrees of freedom matching. Prismatic connections are modelled by the Lagrange multiplier technique that constrains positions and rotation of a sliding node to the varying position and rotation of a path element. Cylindrical joints are introduced in similar way by Lagrange multipliers releasing the sliding node rotation. The principle of stationary potential energy is used to write the non-linear equilibrium equation including the Lagrange multiplier influence. To solve the non-linear equation a Taylor expansion is carried out and the Newton-Raphson procedure is employed. The frame element is considered elastic, following the Saint-Venant-Kirchhoff constitutive model. Selected examples are used to validate the formulation and to show its possibilities of application...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results {{from a series of}} experimental tests carried out to determine the damping characteristics of a section of a 375 m long pile-supported wharf structure under forced excitation. The test program was designed with two primary objectives: (1) to identify the fundamental damping of the structure by using structural microvibration signals produced by tides, wind and microtremors, and (2) to evaluate the variation of the dynamic properties as a function of response amplitude by applying initial displacements of varying amplitude to the deck using a pull mechanism. Although the wharf was designed as a series of independent deck sections, the study revealed that the non-structural frames and piping supported on top of the wharf tie adjacent sections together and have a significant influence on the dynamic behaviour, particularly in the longitudinal direction. Care must be taken in to provide <b>sliding</b> <b>connections</b> for wharf supported structures or to include the influence of these elements in the original design. From our review of the properties identified under the different excitation levels, it was determined that the wharf has relatively linear behaviour with an equivalent viscous damping of about 3 %.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade {{there has been a}} {{worldwide}} increase in the use of retractable roofs for stadia. This increase has been based on the flexibility and better economic performance offered by venues featuring retractable roofs compared to those with traditional fixed roofs. With this increased interest an evolution in retractable roof systems has followed. This dissertation is concerned with the development of concepts for retractable roof systems. A review is carried out to establish the current state-of-the-art of retractable roof design. A second review of deployable structures is used to identify a suitable retractable structure for further development. The structure chosen is formed by a two-dimensional ring of pantographic bar elements interconnected through simple revolute hinges. A concept for retractable roofs is then proposed by covering the bar elements with rigid cover plates. To prevent the cover plates from inhibiting the motion of the structure a theorem governing the shape of these plate elements is developed through a geometrical study of the retractable mechanism. Applying the theorem it is found that retractable structures of any plan shape can be formed from plate elements only. To prove the concept a 1. 3 meter diameter model is designed and built. To increase the structural efficiency of the proposed retractable roof concept it is investigated if the original plan shape can be adapted to a spherical surface. The investigation reveals that {{it is not possible to}} adapt the mechanism but the shape of the rigid cover plates can be adapted to a spherical surface. Three novel retractable mechanisms are then developed to allow opening and closing of a structure formed by such spherical plate elements. Two mechanisms are based on a spherical motion for the plate elements. It is shown that the spherical structure can be opened and closed by simply rotating the individual plates about fixed points. Hence a simple structure is proposed where each plate is rotated individually in a synchronous motion. To eliminate the need for mechanical synchronisation of the motion, a mechanism based on a reciprocal arrangement of the plates is developed. The plate elements are interconnected through <b>sliding</b> <b>connections</b> allowing them mutually to support each other, hence forming a self-supporting structure in which the motion of all plates is synchronised. To simplify the structure further, an investigation into whether the plate elements can be interconnected solely through simple revolute joints is carried out. This is not found to be possible for a spherical motion. However, a spatial mechanism is developed in which the plate elements are interconnected through bars and spherical joints. Geometrical optimisation of the motion path and connection points is used to eliminate the internal strains that occur in the initial design of this structure so a single degree-of-freedom mechanism is obtained. The research presented in this dissertation has hence led to the development of a series of novel concepts for retractable roof systems...|$|R

Reports have been advocated the reliability of digital slides in routine diagnostics. We have designed a retrospective, comparative study to evaluate the scanning properties and digital slide based diagnostic accuracy. Methods 8 pathologists reevaluated 306 randomly selected cases from our archives. The slides were scanned with a 20 × Plan-Apochromat objective, using a 3 -chip Hitachi camera, resulting 0. 465 μm/pixel resolution. Slide management was supported with dedicated Data Base and Viewer software tools. Pathologists used their office PCs for evaluation and reached the digital <b>slides</b> via intranet <b>connection.</b> The diagnostic coherency and uncertainty related to digital slides and scanning quality were analyzed. Results Good to excellent image quality of slides was recorded in 96 %. In half of the critical 61 digital slides, poor image quality was related to section folds or floatings. In 88. 2 % of the studied cases the digital diagnoses were in full agreement with the consensus. Out of the overall 36 incoherent cases, 7 (2. 3 %) were graded relevant without any recorded uncertainty by the pathologist. Excluding the non-field specific cases from each pathologist's record this ratio was 1. 76 % of all cases. Conclusions Our results revealed that: 1) digital slide based histopathological diagnoses can be highly coherent with those using optical microscopy; 2) the competency of pathologists is a factor {{more important than the}} quality of digital slide; 3) poor digital slide quality do not endanger patient safety as these errors are recognizable by the pathologist and further actions for correction could be taken.

40|$|According to {{the codes}} of {{practice}} for design of concrete structures, the effect of solar radiation has to be given due consideration. However, it is not specifically incorporated in the structural design. Often providing expansion or sliding joints is the common practice to accommodate the effect of solar radiation. The need to provide reinforcement bars at tensile stress regions where thermal stresses may develop within the design life of the structure is currently an undocumented fact. Therefore the main aim {{of this research was}} to investigate the significance of solar radiation effect on concrete water retaining structures and to highlight the occurrence of high stress zones that need attention. The investigation was performed using a finite element model with gathered solar radiation data. The model was simulated with probable thermal properties of concrete and environmental conditions including solar heat flux, to identify the governing parameters. In order to process large amounts of data and for economic reasons, a finite element method of analysis using ANSYS software was considered. This provided the robustness and contributed to focus on the sensitivity of the parameters under investigation. Further, several simplified models were verified with numerical calculations and compared with the finite element model. Characteristic points on stress response curve from the finite element analysis were compared with the numerical results. Comparisons were made with respect to the accuracy and reliability of using the finite element model for the analysis. Based on the verified modeling approach, a typical underground water tank was investigated for sliding and fixed roof slab to wall connectivity. The temperature variation and corresponding stress variations were obtained. It was found that significantly high tensile stresses are developed at the soffit level of the roof slab near the column heads, where normally only compressive stresses are expected. This occurs for both fixed and <b>sliding</b> roof slab-to-wall <b>connections.</b> Also at the mid spans, as the top surface of the roof slab was being compressed due to thermal expansion, the bottom surface was not being compressed due to the comparatively low temperature than the top surface (i. e. the temperature gradient). Therefore the bottom fibers developed tensile stresses, which was significantly more than the tensile stress due to selfweight only. It is conclusive that the solar radiation is significant on concrete water retaining structures and the use of sliding or fixity conditions between the roof slab and wall is not effective in minimizing the tensile stresses due to solar heat gain...|$|R
40|$|In {{view of the}} {{difficulties}} with implementing the innovative components and systems conceived in the I 3 CON project on a dwelled building (because of their early stage of development), {{one of the main}} demonstration activities was building a Mock-up module to test the feasibility (in terms of physical integration and logical interoperability) of these components and systems, and evaluate their overall performance. The design of all the systems involved in the Mock-up has the aim to develop new and more efficient solutions for the common issues in housing and, at the same time, to allow the evaluation of these systems. The values to be measured and monitored are: water (hot and cold), electricity and energy consumptions; temperature (ambient and surface) and relative humidity degree, both indoor and outdoor; presence; water temperature and flow; CO 2 concentration; and light level. This is done by means of a network of sensors, meters and actuators deployed throughout the Mock-up. The following components and systems have been developed by I 3 CON partners and are implemented in the Mock-up, namely: - Façade panels, by Dragados (DRA). - Electro-chromic windows, by Saint-Gobain Recherche (SGR). - Under-floor radiant heating, Water saving system and Domestic fire extinguishing system, by Uponor (UPO). - Multi-service trunking system, by the University of Loughborough (LOU). - Wireless sensor network, by Thales Research & Technologies (TRT). All these systems are controlled by the Building Operating System (BOS) developed by Lonix (LON). Besides, all that information handled by the BOS can be accessed through Mobile Productivity Tools developed by Intracom (ICOM) for carrying out operation and maintenance tasks. Regarding the architectural design of the Mock-up, the innovative effort has been aimed to the development of new prefabricated façade solutions adapting current manufacturing processes, such as the “Sandwich Framex” typology, and the improvement in the thermal and acoustical behaviour of the Mock-up envelope with passive strategies, e. g. by using Phase Change Materials (PCMs) or vegetation. The façade panels of the Mock-up were made up according to one of the following structural configurations, all of them making use of Glass-fibre Reinforced Concrete (GRC) : - GRC Stud-frame: GRC shell attached to a metallic frame. Two panels feature this solution, with a special plasterboard interior sheathing enhanced with PCM micro-capsules whose behaviour will be compared to that of a conventional one. - GRC Sandwich: panel anchored to the main structure by means of cast-in channels and <b>sliding</b> bolt <b>connections</b> to accommodate the assembly tolerances. The innermost surface features a special pattern to improve the acoustical behaviour by diminishing the reverberation time. The outmost surface is covered with different kinds of light composite panels for aesthetics reasons. - Sandwich Framex: it is an evolution which comprises “indoor sandwich + metallic frame + external elements”. One of the main advantages of the Sandwich Framex is the flexibility of the external cladding, which may consist of a great variety of elements configured in a modular way over a common sub-structure (the steel frame) and can be installed {{so that they can be}} easily disassembled for maintenance or upgrade. Different external elements have been selected in response both to bio-climatic concepts and architectural trends, among others: photo-voltaic cells, vegetated modules and a variety of composite/laminated panels. Two of the Mock-up façades which are configured with this solution include, besides, PCM packed in plastic boxes within the sandwich core, in order to improve thermal behaviour. For the sake of a better thermal efficiency, visual comfort (in terms of glare) and privacy, an Electro-Chromic Glazing Unit (ECGU) has been provided in one of the Mock-up rooms. The ECGU is fitted into a standard window frame allowing electrical power and control cabling. The ECGU makes possible certain degrees of shading that are controlled by the BOS according to solar irradiance, presence and indoor temperature, and operated in conjunction with the HVAC system thanks to the integration of all the systems within the BOS. The Water Saving System consists in re-circulating the hot water only when it is needed. The system is connected to the sensor network in the building, and is activated whenever a person is within a predetermined area (kitchen or bathroom) or the water temperature inside the pipes is lower than a set value. Thanks to this solution, less water is wasted and there is less waiting time for hot water to be delivered. The Domestic Fire Extinguisher System stands out for its simplicity: the water supply for the toilet cistern passes through the sprinklers. Thus, every time the toilet is flushed, confirmation is provided that there is no impediment for the water to flow (e. g. incrustations due to hard water) and therefore the system would work if a fire started. The Under-Floor Heating (UFH) system has been installed over the floor concrete slab. Its main virtue is its reduced installation height which makes it especially suitable for renovation works. The use of Cross-linked Polyethylene (PEX) pipes for these systems, installed using the “pipe-in-pipe” method, facilitates the renovation of the pipes given the case. The Multi-Services Trunking System (MSTS) is a very innovative concept that comprises a set of runs for different kinds of media incorporated within a single vertical major artery and horizontal distribution nodes. The MSTS has been manufactured using rapid prototyping techniques, and a small portion has been installed in the Mock-up for proving the concept, delivering hot and cold water, air and electricity. Concerning the monitoring and control of the Mock-up, the following inputs are studied: - Consumptions measured with metering devices: Cold and hot water; Electricity. - Parameters measured by the WSN: CO 2 concentration; Presence by means of Passive Infra-Red (PIR) technology; Relative Humidity (RH) degree; Light level; and Indoor ambient temperature. There is a gateway that converts the radio messages transmitted by the sensors into TCP/IP messages accessible from the BOS. - Sensors deployed at different layers of the façade panels: Ambient and surface temperatures; Relative humidity degree. They are intended to assess the overall performance of the envelope system, with a focus on the effect of PCMs and vegetation. - Parameters measured with wired sensors: Presence; Light level; Water temperature and flow in the pipes; and Ambient and surface temperature (indoor and outdoor). Based on the information gathered by the sensor network, the BOS controls the Mock-up handling the following signals: Readings from the metering devices; Inputs from the sensors located in the kitchen, the bathroom and the test rooms; Data from the HVAC and UFH systems (controlled individually for each room to allow comparisons between them), the heat pump and the water pumps (for consumption simulation); Signals from the façade panels’ temperature and relative humidity degree sensors. Remote access to the Mock-up monitoring and control systems is very important for the measurement plans. Internet connection plays an important role for accessing the data and carrying out dwelling usage simulations. Furthermore, the application of Mobile Productivity Tools (MPTs), for example a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) carried out by the maintenance staff, makes possible that any relevant information about the equipment installed in the building (i. e. the Mock-up), such as the assembly drawings, location in the building lay-out, and any data accessible from the BOS, will be available in real time for the operator working on site. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________En vista de las dificultades para implementar los innovadores componentes y sistemas concebidos en el proyecto I 3 CON en una vivienda habitada (debido a su temprano estado de desarrollo), una de las actividades principales de demostración fue construir un Módulo prototipo para ensayar la viabilidad (en términos de integración física e inter-operatividad lógica) de estos componentes y sistemas y evaluar su comportamiento global. El diseño de todos los sistemas del Módulo tiene como objetivo desarrollar nuevas y más eficientes soluciones a problemas comunes en vivienda y, al mismo tiempo, permitir la evaluación de dichos sistemas. Los valores a medir y monitorizar son: consumos de agua (caliente y fría), electricidad y energía; temperatura (ambiente y superficial) y grado de humedad relativo, tanto interior como exterior; presencia; temperatura y flujo de agua; concentración de CO 2; y nivel de luz. Esto se hace mediante una red de sensores, contadores y actuadores desplegados a lo largo del Módulo. Los siguientes componentes y sistemas han sido desarrollados por socios de I 3 CON e implementados en el Módulo, a saber: - Paneles de fachada, por Dragados (DRA). - Ventanas electro-crómicas, por Saint-Gobain Recherche (SGR). - Calefacción por suelo radiante, Sistema de ahorro de agua y Sistema doméstico de extinción de incendios, por Uponor (UPO). - Sistema de conductos multi-servicio, por la Universidad de Loughborough (LOU). - Red de sensores inalámbricos, por Thales Research & Technologies (TRT). Todos estos sistemas se controlan mediante el Sistema Operativo del Edificio (BOS) desarrollado por Lonix (LON). Además, a toda esa información manejada por el BOS puede accederse a través de las Herramientas de Productividad Móviles de Intracom (ICOM) para operación y mantenimiento. Respecto al diseño arquitectónico del Módulo, el esfuerzo innovador se ha centrado en el desarrollo de nuevas soluciones de fachada prefabricada adaptando procesos de fabricación existentes, tales como la tipología “Sándwich Framex”, y en la mejora del|$|R
