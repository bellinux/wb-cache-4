40|$|AbstractExperimental {{setup for}} force sensing using an optical fibre was developed. The {{plastic optical fibre}} (POF) and {{stainless}} <b>spring</b> <b>sheet,</b> which is a material for beam, were {{used to evaluate the}} performance of the force sensor during macro-bending. The sensor consists of a POF bonded on the surface of a flexible metal beam {{in the form of a}} cantilever configuration. The POF assembled beam was placed on the table with the side with opened ends of cable (connected to the source and the detector) fixed to supports while the detecting end of the beam is to hang with various masses for the equivalent to the applied downward forces. Macro-bending of the detecting beam as the result of applying different forces cause differences in power loss in the POF and therefore in the output optical power. The relation between applied force and output optical power was revealed. This study highlights the potential use of POF sensors for various force sensing applications...|$|E
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Thematic maps were produced for surface water in stratum 46. The presence of {{large amounts of}} surface water, particularly during the May period, is readily apparent in the photoreduced thematic maps. Sheet water comprises much of the water detected in the May scene. <b>Spring</b> <b>sheet</b> water tends to be ephemeral and {{occurs as a result}} of an ice seal which exists within the underlying soil, temporarily preventing the percolation of water. The abundance of water in the May scene is also a result of unusually heavy precipitation which occurred during the spring and the previous fall. A qualitative analysis of the July map indicates surface water is less abundant than during the previous May; however, surface water present in the July 1975 LANDSAT scene was unusually abundant compared to other midsummer LANDSAT scenes obtained since 1972. This condition was particularly apparent for the drift plain...|$|E

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method for melt-free transformation of bundles from polycrystalline fibers into bundles of single crystalline fiber or of fibers with single crystalline area, comprises providing (1) bundles of fibers from polycrystalline material, laterally fanning out (3) the fiber bundles {{in such a way}} that the contacts of the fibers of the bundle are abated among each other, recrystallizing (4) the material contained in the fiber bundles in an oven zone at a temperature that lies below the melting temperature of the fiber material, cooling the fiber bundles, and rolling up (5) the fiber bundles on a cover or simultaneously cutting the fibers of bundles or all bundles vertically to fiber direction {{in such a way that}} short fibers are received. The fibers are transported over a transport line on which the fanning out takes place, where the fanning out takes place by electrostatic loading of the fibers by guiding the fiber bundles through column between two oppositively loaded electrodes, tightening and relaxing the fibers of the fiber bundles in oscillating manner, guiding the fibers through a compressed air pillow and recrystallizing the fibers in a hot gas stream. The process is continuously carried out and the fiber bundle tension is constantly held over the temperature line. The hot gas stream through which the fiber bundle is guided for recrystallization has a temperature of 0. 8 - 0. 85 T of melt related to the absolute melting temperature of the fiber. The hot gas stream is generated through the combustion of propane-oxygen-mixture containing inert gas such as nitrogen or argon. The transport speed of the fiber bundle is 150 - 300 mm/h and/or the fiber bundle tension is 0. 2 - 0. 1 N. The tightening and relaxing of the fiber is carried out by a spiked roller. The fiber bundle tension is adjusted by redirection rods, tensor roller, <b>spring</b> <b>sheet</b> metal and/or transport roller pair in a value of 0. 15 - 0. 18 N. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a fiber bundle. USE - Method for melt-free transformation of bundles of polycrystalline fibers into bundles of single crystalline fiber or fibers with single crystalline area, useful for the production of single crystalline sapphire fibers. ADVANTAGE - The method ensures simple and efficient melt-free transformation of bundles of polycrystalline fibers into bundles of single crystalline fiber or fibers with single crystalline area, with good flexibility...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to determine deflections of fiber glass leaf spring depending on these parameters: form of the leaf spring, number of leafs in spring and contact between spring leafs (comparing springs with lubricated and non-lubricated leaf surfaces). Primarily, the mechanical properties and surface friction coefficient of the fiber glass was measured to get enough information about material used for the study. According selected leaf spring geometry, samples of fiber glass leaf springs were made. Stiffness of these samples was determined during bending tests. Finite element method and analytical formulas was also used to evaluate accuracy of experimental results. Experimentally found, that leaf springs with less uneven form has a greater stiffness. Also found that twice reduced number of leaf <b>spring</b> <b>sheets</b> (and doubled sheet thickness) resulted from 2, 86 to 3, 44 times greater leaf spring stiffness. Noted, that lubrication influence decreases when increases load on leaf spring and decreases number of <b>spring</b> <b>sheets...</b>|$|R
40|$|In this work, a {{methodology}} to create parameterized {{finite element models}} is presented, particularly focusing {{on the development of}} suitable algorithms in order to generate models and meshes with high computational efficiency. The methodology is applied to the modeling of two common mechanical devices: an optical linear encoder and a gear transmission. This practical application constitutes a tough test to the methodology proposed, given the complexity and the large number of components that set up this high-precision measurement device and the singularity of the internal gears. The geometrical and mechanical particularities of the components lead to multidimensional modeling, seeking to ensure proper interaction between the different types of finite elements. Besides, modeling criteria to create components such as compression and torsion <b>springs,</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>springs,</b> bearings, or adhesive joints are also presented in the article. The last part of the work aims to validate the simulation results obtained with the methodology proposed with those derived from experimental tests through white noise base-driven vibration and hammer impact excitation modal analysis...|$|R

40|$|The {{actuator}} concepts for thermal {{shape memory}} alloys like wires, <b>springs</b> and <b>sheet</b> metals have been broadly explored. A {{new form of}} shape memory actuators are bulk actuators with a diameter of 4 to 6 mm and a length of 8 to 12 mm. This new actuator geometry contrasts with the previous variants charged with pressure and not with stretch. Preliminary investigations have shown operating displacements up to 200 µm and forces over 1 kN. This work o ers a first overview of the possible applications based on the material available on the market. An examination of the procedures in the crystal structure is {{outside the scope of}} this work. For the investigation of the usability of the new actuators the three common concepts for wires: spring load, free stroke and antagonistic arrangement are comparatively considered.

40|$|A {{recently}} proposed solid-shell {{finite element}} [1, 2] {{based on the}} Enhanced Assumed Strain (EAS) formulation with a one point quadrature integration scheme is applied to large deformation elastoplastic thin-shell applications including contact. One of the main features of the RESS (Reduced Enhanced Solid Shell) element arises in its minimum number of enhancing parameters (only one), sufficient to circumvent the well-known volumetric and shear locking phenomena, and leading to a computationally efficient performance {{when compared to other}} 3 D or solid-shell enhanced elements. Also, the element can take an arbitrary number of integration points through thickness direction within a single element layer, which provides a great advantage for <b>spring</b> analysis in <b>sheet</b> forming simulation.

40|$|The {{application}} of a higher-order subsonic potential flow panel method to the solution of three-dimensional flow about wing and wing-body combinations with leading-edge vortex separation is presented. The governing equations are the linear flow differential equation and nonlinear boundary conditions which require that the flow be parallel to the wing and body surfaces and that the free vortex <b>sheet,</b> <b>springing</b> from the leading and trailing edges, be aligned with the local flow and support no pressure jump. The vortex core is modeled as a simple line vortex which receives vorticity from the free sheet through a connecting sheet. The Kutta condition is imposed on all appropriate edges of the wing. This set of nonlinear equations is solved by an iterative procedure. The Goethert rule accounts for compressibility. The method has been programmed for the CDC 6600. Delta wings, gothic wings, arrow wings, cambered wings, and wing with body have been analyzed. Initial studies involving variations of panel density, vortex sheet sizing, Jacobian update, and initial geometry demonstrate that the present method generally exhibits good convergence characteristics...|$|R
40|$|The {{fabrication}} {{and operation}} of membrane switches are discussed. The membrane switch functions as a normally open, momentary contact, low-voltage pressure-sensitive device. Its design is a three-layer sandwich usually constructed of polyester film. Conductive patterns are deposited onto the inner side of top and bottom sheets by silk screening. The center spacer is then placed between the two circuit layers to form a sandwich, generally held together by an adhesive. When pressure {{is applied to the}} top layer, it flexes through the punched openings of the spacer to establish electrical contact between conductive pads of the upper and lower sheets, momentarily closing the circuit. Upon release of force the top <b>sheet</b> <b>springs</b> back to its normal open position. The membrane touch switch is being used in a rapidly expanding range of applications, including instrumentation, appliances, electronic games and keyboards. Its board acceptance results from its low cost, durability, ease of manufacture, cosmetic appeal and design flexibility.

In {{the course of}} his travels all over the world, he came into contact with the musical narratives of the West, of the South of India, and these styles are reflected in some of his songs. There are several classifications of his work. The ones that beginners most often use is that based on genre - devotional (Puja Porjaay), romantic (Prem Porjaay) It often becomes difficult, if not impossible, on hearing a song, to determine if it falls in the devotional genre or the romantic. The line between the two is blurred, by certain creations of Tagore himself, e.g. Tomarei Koriyachi Jibonero Dhrubotara. Also, Tagore never made these divisions. Only after his death was the need felt to categorize, compile and thus preserve his work, and the genre-classification system was born out of this need. seasonal (Prokriti Porjaay) - summer (Grishho), monsoon (Borsha), autumn (Shorot), early winter (Hemonto), winter (<b>Sheet),</b> <b>Spring</b> (Boshonto); diverse (Bichitro), patriotic (Deshatmobodhok).

The tightly focused beam of a diode-pumped Q-switched Nd : YAG-laser is scanned with a step size of 20 µm across a sample surface. The emission spectrum of each laser-induced plasma generated by a single laser pulse of 2 mJ energy is guided to a spectrometer of the Paschen-Runge type to detect the line radiation of up to 24 elements simultaneously covering a spectral range from the vacuum ultraviolet to the near infrared. The time resolved spectral signals linked to the respective detector channel are processed to generate maps of the spatial distribution of elements in the sample surface. In a measuring field of typically 1 x 1 cm 2 250 000 measurements are performed within 11 min.
