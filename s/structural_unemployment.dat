25|$|There are {{different}} assumptions as well. According to Richard L. Jensen, cyclical unemployment was a grave matter primarily until 1935. Between 1935 and 1941 <b>structural</b> <b>unemployment</b> became the bigger problem. Especially the unions successes in demanding higher wages pushed management into introducing new efficiency-oriented hiring standards. It ended inefficient labor such as child labor, casual unskilled work for subminimum wages, and sweatshop conditions. In {{the long term}} the shift to efficiency wages led to high productivity, high wages and a high standard of living. But it necessitated a well-educated, well-trained, hard-working labor force.

25|$|<b>Structural</b> <b>unemployment</b> in Muslim {{countries}} {{seems to}} be high for women and economic opportunities are limited. Possible explanations for this phenomenon could the same determinants of high self-employment among females and low rates of female employers: low levels of economic development, gendered employment social norms, or capital-intensive industry. This last explanation may be particularly salient in the oil-rich Muslim nations because petroleum exports are capital-intensive and require very high skilled labor which most Muslim women are incapable of providing given low levels of education. The Great Recession has increased unemployment across the board in many Muslim nations and female workers were not left unaffected. According to the World Bank, in 2009, 22.9% of women were unemployed in Egypt.|$|E

40|$|Abstract : After {{a decade}} of <b>structural</b> reforms, <b>unemployment</b> rates have tripled in Argentina. This paper is {{concerned}} with the measurement of unemployment risk and its distribution. We show the importance of considering re-incidence in the measurement of risk and develop a methodology. Our estimates for Argentina show that, though the typical unemployment spell is short, once re-incidence is taken into account, unemployment risk is high, has risen substantially in the last decade and is shared very unequally in the labor force. This counters the established view that unemployment is a small risk, short-duration phenomenon, which arises when re-incidence is not considered. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims to {{investigate}} the unemployment hysteresis hypothesis, in which the endogenously determined break points are incorporated, by using annual data of actual urban unemployment rates during 1978 - 2009 in China. We treat the break date as unknown and utilize recursive, rolling and sequential tests to determine the endogenous structural breaks which are caused by external shocks. Our empirical findings show that three structural breaks existed in the time series of China’s actual urban unemployment rates {{and we can not}} reject the unit-root hypothesis, which is consistent with the hysteresis hypothesis of <b>unemployment.</b> Key words: <b>Structural</b> breaks; <b>Unemployment</b> hysteresis; External shock...|$|R
40|$|The {{consequences}} of business cycle contingencies in unemployment insurance systems are considered in a search-matching model allowing for shifts between "good" and "bad" states of nature. We show {{that not only}} is there an insurance argument for such contingencies, but also an incentive argument. If benefits are less distortionary in a recession than a boom, it follows that countercyclical benefits reduce average distortions compared to state independent benefits. We show that optimal benefits are state contingent and tend to reduce the <b>structural</b> (average) <b>unemployment</b> rate, although the variability of unemployment may increase. business cycle; incentives; insurance; unemployment benefits,...|$|R

In this chapter we resort to Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) techniques to ascertain which shocks and what propagation mechanism underlie {{the functioning of the}} labour markets in both countries. Our results show that price adjustment is more sticky and that real wage flexibility is higher in Portugal.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the regional aspects of <b>structural</b> change and <b>unemployment</b> in the UK. Manufacturing decline has severely hit the industrial conurbations of the North. Although reflecting long-run trends, this decline has been exacerbated by poor macroeconomic management. New service {{jobs have been}} created {{but most of these}} are in the South. This growing North-South divide is reflected in a southward drift of population. The extent of the northern decline is masked by government expenditures that help to maintain employment in depressed areas. But this is only a temporary solution. As population drifts away from the depressed areas, public expenditures will eventually be cut, causing further loss of employment and population in these areas. Using a simple export base model, the paper quantifies the underlying decline of the northern economy. In relative terms, this decline has been almost as fast in the 1990 s as in the previous decade of industrial crisis. <b>Unemployment,</b> <b>Structural</b> Change, Migration, Regions...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the labor market during the Great Recession and find some startling {{features}} underlying the stagnation and decline of 2007 - 10. The population {{in the labor force}} has stagnated while the population that is out of the labor force has grown sharply. For the first time since we have had adequate data, the likelihood of an individual leaving the labor force from being unemployed is higher than the likelihood that he or she will move from unemployment to employment. We argue that the most plausible reasons for the continued slump in the labor market have to do with inadequate aggregate demand and are not because of structural or skill-mismatch reasons. aggregate demand, cyclical, labor market, labor transitions, <b>structural,</b> underemployment, <b>unemployment,...</b>|$|R
