This paper investigates the design and performance of a virtual packet switched network overlayed on top of cell-based connection-oriented ATM networks. The virtual packet switched network is made possible by utilizing connectionless servers. Two packet forwarding techniques are examined in the context of connectionless service. Forwarding connectionless packets in a cell-by-cell manner (<b>streaming</b> <b>mode)</b> is shown to result in low end-to-end delay. Packet-by-packet forwarding of connectionless data (reassembly mode) can exhibit a comparable packet loss rate, but <b>streaming</b> <b>mode</b> is shown to produce significantly lower packet loss for very small buffers.

30|$|As {{the mode}} {{switching}} between single stream and dual streams is {{done at the}} user side based on maximizing SE, one may argue that the chosen mode {{may not be the}} most energy efficient one. Interestingly, as the total power consumption is the same for the two mode according to the power model given by (4), the choice made at the user side can lead to the most energy efficient mode, which can be explained as follows. Comparing (11) with (19), we can know that the denominators of the expressions on the right side are the same, so the value of estimated EE is determined by the numerators. Thus if the sum of transport block size of the preferred MCS levels for dual <b>stream</b> <b>mode</b> is greater than that for single <b>stream</b> <b>mode,</b> dual <b>stream</b> <b>mode</b> is selected by the user, and vice versa. So the energy efficient criterion for mode selection between single stream and dual streams is the same as maximizing SE criterion.|$|E

The algorithm {{is an example of}} DES-type cryptosystem with a drastically simplified key scheduling. It encrypts 64 -bit messages into 64 -bit cryptograms using 256 -bit keys. The GOST document [5] recommends the following four modes: simple substitution mode (electronic codebook mode), <b>stream</b> <b>mode</b> called the (Γ-mode in [5]), <b>stream</b> <b>mode</b> with feedback, and authentication mode. 2 The description of the GOST algorithm The GOST algorithm consists of 32 iterations (twice more than for the DES).

40|$|Work on the {{generalisation}} of cartographic line data, so {{that small}} scale map {{data can be}} derived from larger scales, has {{led to the development of}} algorithms for a variety of generalisation operations, including line simplification. A major objective when capturing linear digital map data is the creation of accurate representation of naturally occurring lines, using a minimum of processing time and storage. When paper maps are converted into a digital representation using manual digitising methods, one time saving method used is that of <b>stream</b> <b>mode</b> digitising. In <b>stream</b> <b>mode</b> the digitiser samples continuously as the cursor is moved along the manuscript line. Co-ordinate density in <b>stream</b> <b>mode</b> is usually determined by time interval, which can lead to the generation of surplus co-ordinate data. For a number of practical considerations this superfluous data should be eliminated. These considerations include: 1. Reduced storage space: this may reduce a data set by up to 75 % (Jenks 1989), which will result in faster data retrieval and management. 2. Faster vector processing: for example, a simplified polygon boundary will reduce the number of boundary segments to be checked for shading or point in polygon algorithms. 3. Reduced plotting time. For these and other reasons, a multitude of line simplification (conditioning) algorithms have been developed. There are many studies that have discussed the merits of different algorithms, these include McMaster (1983), McMaster (1987) and Zhilin (1988). These studies contain detailed descriptions of many of these algorithms. A brief discussion is given here of the major types of simplification algorithm. Two algorithms, described in detail below, were implemented in the AutoLISP programming language and tested in AutoCAD, a computer aided design package (CAD).

40|$|It {{is crucial}} for ATM to {{efficiently}} support existing data applications. One of the promising methods of supporting data over ATM uses connectionless servers providing a packet switching service in the ATM network. There are two primary methods for forwarding cell based datagrams in a connectionless server: reassembly mode, where the datagrams are reconstructed before forwarding, and <b>streaming</b> <b>mode,</b> where each cell is forwarded as it arrives. The two modes impact the packet loss probability at a connectionless server, the packet delay, the interleaving method used, the AAL used, and the buffer space required. This paper investigates the performance of two forwarding modes. Extensive simulations show that forwarding connectionless packets in <b>streaming</b> <b>mode</b> is shown to result in lower packet loss and endto -end delay than reassembly mode. 1 Introduction The deployment of Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks promises to open opportunities to provide advanced network applications suc [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The {{solar wind}} {{is a highly}} {{supersonic}} outflow of coronal plasma flowing in a close to radial direction out from the Sun. Generally, there are two modes of outflow, a fast <b>stream</b> <b>mode</b> with velocities {{in the range of}} 750 kms− 1 to 800 kms− 1, and a slow <b>stream</b> <b>mode</b> with velocities in the range of 350 kms− 1 to 400 kms− 1. The method of interplanetary scintillation (IPS) is used to obtain solar wind velocity estimates by observing the “twinkling” of radio waves from distant compact sources caused by density variations in the solar wind. The Aberystwyth IPS group has been conducting IPS observations using the European Incoherent SCATter radar (EISCAT) in northern Scandinavia since 1993 and more recently using the Multi-Element Radio-Linked Interferometer Network (MERLIN) radio telescopes in the United Kingdom. This thesis investigates the large-scale structure of the solar wind using IPS observations in conjunction with white-light, extreme ultra-violet (EUV) and X-ray Carrington rotation maps from ground-based: Mauna Loa; and space-based: SOlar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and Yohkoh; as well as in-situ spacecraft observations of solar wind velocity from Wind and Ulysses. A complete study of EISCAT IPS data from 1994 to 2003 is undertaken looking for detections of interaction in terms of shear layers and co-rotating interaction regions (CIRs) by ballistically mapping the IPS observations out to in-situ distances to see how interaction develops. From this, an investigation was carried out with solar minimum (1994 - 1997) EISCAT IPS data investigating a possible bi-modal fast solar wind structure. In addition, the technique of extremely long-baseline IPS measurements (developed from 2002) was used to look at the finer structure of solar wind velocity. This technique was also used to investigate the direction of flow which included observations of fast and slow wind, interaction regions, and the passage of a magnetic cloud.
