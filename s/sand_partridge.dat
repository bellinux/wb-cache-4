25|$|The Eastern Desert has a quite {{different}} range of fauna and has {{much in common with}} the Sinai Peninsula, showing the importance of the broad Nile in separating the two desert regions. Here are found the striped hyena, Nubian ibex, bushy-tailed jird, golden spiny mouse, Blanford's fox and Rüppell's fox. The <b>sand</b> <b>partridge,</b> streaked scrub warbler, mourning wheatear and white-crowned wheatear are typical of this region. The high rocky mountains of Gebel Elba in the south have a distinctive range of animals including the aardwolf, striped polecat, and common genet, and there may still be African wild ass in this area.|$|E
50|$|The <b>sand</b> <b>partridge</b> (Ammoperdix heyi) is a gamebird in the {{pheasant}} family Phasianidae of {{the order}} Galliformes, gallinaceous birds.|$|E
50|$|When disturbed, <b>sand</b> <b>partridge</b> {{prefers to}} run rather than fly, but if {{necessary}} it flies {{a short distance}} on rounded wings. The song is a slurred kwa-kwa-kwa.|$|E
40|$|The {{seasonality}} {{of group}} size and composition in <b>sand</b> <b>partridges</b> was {{studied at the}} Ibex Reserve in central Saudi Arabia. Mean group size and fl ock encounter rate were signifi cantly related to rainfall and temperature. During winter and the breeding season (March to April), the encounter rate on the valley fl oors was distinctly lower than that observed during summer. Although encounter rates did not diff er signifi cantly between valleys, <b>sand</b> <b>partridges</b> {{were more likely to}} be encountered in narrow, stony valleys. Correcting for valley width, encounter rates did not diff er between valleys. Male and female encounter rates were constant throughout the reserve, indicating a constant sex ratio throughout the year. Results are in line with earlier fi ndings reported from more northern habitats such as the Eilat Mountains (Israel) and the Rum Wildlife Reserve (Jordan). Human disturbance in parts of the reserve is high and may have an impact on group size and composition...|$|R
50|$|Among the birds, {{the large}} grey babbler, great grey shrike, king crow, myna, bee-eater, hoopoe, swift, vulture, eagle, kite, owl, <b>sand</b> grouse, quail, <b>partridge,</b> green pigeon and peacock {{are found in}} the {{district}}. Herbivores in the district include sambar, blackbuck, chital, wild sheep, mouse deer, hare and rabbit.|$|R
50|$|The see-see {{partridge}} occurs in southwest Asia, and the <b>sand</b> <b>partridge</b> in Egypt and the Middle East. Both are resident breeders in dry, open country, often in hill areas.|$|E
50|$|This {{partridge}} has {{its main}} native range from southeast Turkey through Syria and Iraq east to Iran and Pakistan. It {{is closely related}} and similar to its counterpart in Egypt and Arabia, the <b>sand</b> <b>partridge,</b> Ammoperdix heyi.|$|E
50|$|This 22-25 cm bird is a {{resident}} breeder in dry, open and often hilly country. It nests in a scantily lined ground scrape laying 5-7 eggs. The <b>sand</b> <b>partridge</b> takes {{a wide variety}} of seeds and some insect food.|$|E
50|$|See-see {{partridge}} is a rotund bird, mainly sandy-brown with wavy {{white and}} brown flank stripes. The male has a grey {{head with a}} black stripe through the eye and a white cheek patch. The neck sides are speckled with white. The head pattern is the best distinction from <b>sand</b> <b>partridge.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>sand</b> <b>partridge</b> is a rotund bird, mainly sandy-brown with wavy {{white and}} brown flank stripes. The male has a grey {{head with a}} white stripe {{in front of the}} eye and a white cheek patch. The neck sides are plain, and not {{speckled}} with white. The head pattern is the best distinction from see-see partridge.|$|E
50|$|The {{combined}} area of Jabal Aja and Northern Ha'il {{has been}} designated an Important Bird and Biodiversity Area because of its importance as a centre for migratory birds especially the demoiselle crane (Grus virgo). Among the important species resident in the reserve are the <b>sand</b> <b>partridge,</b> griffon vulture, Egyptian vulture, desert owl and pale rockfinch. Among the migratory species that visit the reserve in passage or over-winter here are Menetries's warbler, white-throated robin, Finsch's wheatear, cinereous bunting and several species of cranes.|$|E

50|$|Over {{five hundred}} species of bird have been {{recorded}} from Oman. Some of these are resident, others arrive in spring to breed, departing by autumn. Still more are in transit, on migration routes between the Palearctic ecozone, Africa and the Indian Subcontinent. The east coast with its mudflats and lagoons is visited by many species of wader, and the mangrove areas are home to the red-wattled lapwing and the collared kingfisher. The coast and offshore islands are home to gulls, terns and cormorants. The mountainous north of the country attracts many passerines in passage, the desert areas are home to the endangered houbara bustard, <b>sand</b> <b>partridge,</b> four species of sandgrouse, desert larks, pipits, wheatears and buntings. The mountains additionally attract golden eagles and Egyptian vultures. The Dhofar region in the south has {{a great variety of}} breeding and migratory species. The Omani owl (Strix butleri) is a species of owl discovered in 2013, and {{is believed to be the}} only bird endemic to Oman.|$|E
40|$|AbstractSkin lipids play an {{important}} role in the regulation of cutaneous water loss (CWL). Earlier studies have shown that Saudi desert birds exhibit a tendency of reduced CWL than birds from temperate environment due to adaptive changes in composition of their skin lipids. In this study, we used thin-layer chromatography (TLC) for separation and detection of non-polar and polar lipids from the skin of six bird species including sooty gull, brown booby, house sparrow, Arabian waxbill, <b>sand</b> <b>partridge,</b> and laughing dove. The lipids were separated and detected on Silica gel G coated TLC plates and quantified by using densitometric image analysis. Rf values of the non-polar lipids were as follows: cholesterol (0. 29), free fatty acids (0. 58), triacylglycerol (0. 69), fatty acids methyl esters (0. 84) and cholesterol ester (0. 97). Rf values for the polar lipids were: cerebroside (0. 42), ceramide (0. 55) and cholesterol (0. 73). The results showed the abundance of fatty acids methyl esters (47. 75 – 60. 46 %) followed by triacylglycerol (12. 69 – 24. 14 %). The remaining lipid compositions were as follows: cholesterol (4. 09 – 13. 18 %), ceramide (2. 18 – 13. 27 %), and cerebroside (2. 53 – 12. 81 %). In conclusion, our findings showed that TLC is a simple and sensitive method for the separation and quantification of skin lipids. We also reported a new protocol for lipid extraction using the zirconia beads for efficient disruption of skin tissues. This study will help us better understand the role of skin lipids in adaptive physiology towards adverse climatic conditions...|$|E
