60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> in {{her chair}} and {{regarded}} his pinched and determined visage.|$|E
60|$|Gudrun {{knew she}} was being admired. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> from her drawing and looked at Ursula, from under her finely-curved lashes.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{perhaps you}} can't. But I understand"; and <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> in her chair, her chin in one hand, holding her elbow with the other, brimmed up with wrath and chagrin.|$|E
60|$|It was {{the first}} time she had called Mrs. Clark by her given name; the first time <b>she</b> had willingly <b>sat</b> <b>back,</b> a woman of Main Street.|$|R
5000|$|The Cast Member Selema Perry Berry was {{a member}} of Denson Temple Peoples Free Methodist Church as Superintendent of Sunday School. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> on the <b>back</b> row with her Pastor Rev. James Brown.|$|R
60|$|The keys lay in {{the palm}} of Maggie's hand. Her heart had begun to beat quickly. Somehow or other, she was {{conscious}} of a thrill of excitement which she had never before experienced, even when <b>she</b> had <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> in her corner of the railway carriage, watching for the frontier, knowing that the wires were busy with her name, and that men who knew no mercy were on her track.|$|R
6000|$|Presently, I remember, <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> on {{her heels}} and looked up into my face. [...] "We've done wrong--and parting's paying. It's time to pay. We needn't have paid, if we'd kept to the track.... You and I, Master, we've got to be men." ...|$|E
60|$|Ella Stowbody, {{who was a}} professional, having studied elocution in Milwaukee, {{disapproved of}} Carol's enthusiasm for recent plays. Miss Stowbody {{expressed}} the fundamental principle of the American drama: {{the only way to}} be artistic is to present Shakespeare. As no one listened to her <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> and looked like Lady Macbeth.|$|E
60|$|He laughed and, {{going to}} the cabinet, brought another of the old blue china cups and saucers. With very deft fingers she {{manipulated}} the machine. Presently, when her task was finished, <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> in her chair, her coffee cup in her hand, her great eyes fixed upon him. She had {{the air of a}} person entirely content.|$|E
6000|$|... "I rather {{think there}} will be no danger," [...] said Mr. Holiday to his wife, turning towards her as <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> upon the <b>back</b> seat. [...] "The road is pretty level and retired, and he will keep close along behind the carryall." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{returned}} with the box {{and placed it on}} the divan near her. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> cross-legged, leaning <b>back</b> on her arms, in the blue shimmer of her embroidered robe and with the tawny halo of her unruly hair about her face which she raised to mine with an air of resignation.|$|R
60|$|The first break {{was from}} Allen, {{who came in}} tenderly {{with a cup of}} coffee, saying that they thought her time was come for being ready for it. His manner always did her good, and <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> up, pushed <b>back</b> her hair, smiled, took the cup, and thanked him lovingly.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> and screwed {{her eyes}} tight, {{as she had}} always done when puzzled. Something had {{happened}} to her, but how it had happened and when it had happened and why it had happened she could not understand. She only knew that {{now for the first}} time she had been granted a moment of clear vision and was seeing things truly.|$|E
6000|$|Alora {{sat down}} and tried to collect her thoughts. Janet got the breakfast unaided and then came to summon her. Alora quietly {{walked into the kitchen}} and sat down at a little table spread for two. There was a dish of crisp bacon, some toast and coffee. Alora silently ate and drank, {{determined}} to maintain her strength. Having finished her meal <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> and asked: ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Lowder faced a moment, in her massive way, what Sir Luke Strett thought. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> there, {{her knees}} apart, {{not unlike a}} picturesque ear-ringed matron at a market-stall; while her friend, before her, dropped their items, tossed the {{separate}} truths of the matter one by one, into her capacious apron. [...] "But is that all he came to you for--to tell you she must be happy?" ...|$|E
60|$|Katharine Beverley's {{table was}} in a quiet corner, and <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> with her <b>back</b> to the window, but even under such {{circumstances}} the change in her {{during the last few}} days was noticeable. There was a frightened light in her eyes, her cheeks were entirely colourless, her hands seemed almost transparent. Such a change in so short a time seemed almost incredible. Crawshay found himself unable to ignore it.|$|R
6000|$|... {{and when}} she had finished, the horse's fore legs grew shorter and spread into wings, his hind legs became claws, {{feathers}} sprouted all over his body, and <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> on the <b>back</b> of a great bird, which bore her to {{the summit of the}} rock. Here she found a nest made of clay and lined with dried moss, and in the centre a tiny man, black and wrinkled, who gave a cry of surprise at the sight of Bellah.|$|R
60|$|Romola {{had sunk}} {{on the first}} seat in the bright saloon, too much agitated, too sick at heart, to care about her place, or be {{conscious}} of discordance in the objects that surrounded her. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> with her <b>back</b> to the door, resting her head on her hands. It seemed a long while since Monna Brigida had gone, and Romola was expecting her return. But {{when the door opened}} she knew it was not Monna Brigida who entered.|$|R
6000|$|His {{conversation}} took {{an intimate}} turn. He expounded for Nelly's benefit the inner history, {{with all its}} ramifications, of a recent unfortunate rift between himself and [...] "the best little girl in Flatbush"--what he had said, what she had said, what her sister had said, and how it all came right in the end. Jill might have felt a little excluded, but {{for the fact that}} a sudden and exciting idea had come to her. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back,</b> thinking.... After all, what else was she to do? She must do something....|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> languidly, {{her head}} lolling {{sideways}} {{against one of}} the wings of the great chair, and languidly assured them she would be better soon if she were but allowed to rest awhile. Ruth drew up a stool to sit beside her, for all that her soul fretted at this delay. What if in consequence she should reach Zoyland Chase too late--to find that Mr. Wilding had gone forth already? But even as she was about to sit, it seemed that the same thought had of a sudden come to Diana. The girl leaned forward, thrusting--as if by an effort--some of her faintness from her.|$|E
60|$|This, of course, sent {{a thrill}} up the spine {{and through the}} {{imagination}} of Miss Dulphemia Rasselyer-Brown, because it showed that the chauffeur was a gentleman in disguise. She thought it very probable {{that he was a}} British nobleman, a younger son, very wild, of a ducal family; and she had her own theories as to why he had entered the service of the Rasselyer-Browns. To be quite candid about it, she expected that the Philippine chauffeur meant to elope with her, and every time he drove her from a dinner or a dance <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> luxuriously, wishing and expecting the elopement to begin.|$|E
60|$|At length <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> up, put <b>back</b> her hair, {{and stared}} about {{her with a}} bewildered aspect, as if not {{distinctly}} recollecting the scene through which she had passed, nor cognizant {{of the situation in}} which it left her. Her face and brow were almost purple with the rush of blood. They whitened, however, by and by, and for some time retained this deathlike hue. She put her hand to her forehead, with a gesture that made me forcibly conscious of an intense and living pain there.|$|R
60|$|Louisa {{had been}} sitting all this while at the extreme end of the row of chairs, right up against the wall. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> with her <b>back</b> to the wall, her head leaning against it, her hands hidden within the folds of a monumental sable muff lying idly in her lap. She had her father on her right, and beyond him Mr. Dobson and his clerk; she saw them all in profile as they looked {{straight}} before them, at the coroner and at each succeeding witness.|$|R
60|$|The doctor came at last. In {{reality it}} was barely five minutes since he had been sent for, but time dragged itself along slowly in that little room. Directly {{afterwards}} Huber, the manager, returned, followed by a sergeant of the police. We all waited for the doctor's examination. I fetched a chair for the child, and she thanked me with a wan little smile. Always <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> with her <b>back</b> to the sofa. There was something terribly suggestive in her utter lack of sympathy with the wounded man.|$|R
60|$|At {{last she}} moved and tapped her fingers upon {{the table at}} her side. Her pent-up ideas had finally found some channel to advance in. Motions {{became more and more}} {{frequent}} as she laboured to carry further and further the problem which occupied her brain. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> and drew a long breath: she sat sideways and leant her forehead upon her hand. Later still she arose, walked up and down the room--at first abstractedly, with her features as firmly set as ever; but by degrees her brow relaxed, her footsteps became lighter and more leisurely; her head rode gracefully and was no longer bowed. She plumed herself like a swan after exertion.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Sir Claude, [...] "I {{was just}} going to say. Let me tell you it will {{surprise}} you." [...] She had finished breakfast now and <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> in her chair again: she waited in silence to hear. He had pushed the things before him a little way and had his elbows on the table. This time, she was convinced, she knew what was coming, and once more, for the crash, as with Mrs. Wix lately in her room, she held her breath and drew together her eyelids. He was going to say she must give him up. He looked hard at her again; then he made his effort. [...] "Should you see your way to let her go?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Carol was ignored. But Kennicott was blustrously cheerful. He {{shouted to}} a farmer, as he slowed up {{to pass the}} frightened team, [...] "There we are--schon gut!" [...] <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back,</b> neglected, frozen, unheroic heroine in a drama insanely undramatic. She made a {{decision}} resolute and enduring. She would tell Kennicott----What would she tell him? She could not say that she loved Erik. DID she love him? But she would have it out. She was not sure whether it was pity for Kennicott's blindness, or irritation at his assumption that he was enough to fill any woman's life, which prompted her, {{but she knew that}} she was out of the trap, that she could be frank; and she was exhilarated with the adventure of it [...] . while in front he was entertaining Erik: ...|$|E
6000|$|Anne [...] "shooed," [...] but the cat {{would not}} [...] "shoo." [...] As long as <b>she</b> stood he <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> on his {{haunches}} {{and gazed at}} her reproachfully out of his one good eye; when she resumed her walk he followed. Anne resigned herself to his company until she reached the gate of Patty's Place, which she coldly shut in his face, fondly supposing {{she had seen the}} last of him. But when, fifteen minutes later, Phil opened the door, there sat the rusty-brown cat on the step. More, he promptly darted in and sprang upon Anne's lap with a half-pleading, half-triumphant [...] "miaow." ...|$|R
60|$|It was on {{a morning}} in early summer, when the garden had grown to be so red and white and yellow in its flowers, and so green in its leaves and stalks, that the box which edged the path was {{beginning}} to be unnoticed, that a girl sat in a small arbor standing on a slight elevation at {{one side of the}} garden, and from which a view could be had both up and down the road. She was rather a slim girl, though tall enough; her hair was dark, her eyes were blue, and <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> on the <b>back</b> of a rustic bench with her feet resting upon the seat; this position she had taken that she might the better view the road.|$|R
60|$|Three days later, Lenore {{accompanied}} her {{father on the}} ride to the Bend country. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> in the <b>back</b> {{seat of the car}} with Jake--an arrangement very gratifying to the cowboy, but received with ill-concealed displeasure by the driver, Nash. They had arranged to start at sunrise, and it became manifest that Nash had expected Lenore to sit beside him all during the long ride. It was her father, however, who took the front seat, and behind Nash's back he had slyly winked at Lenore, as if to compliment her on the evident success of their deep plot. Lenore, at the first opportunity that presented, shot Nash a warning glance which was sincere enough. Jake had begun to use keen eyes, and there was no telling what he might do.|$|R
60|$|She {{liked him}} on Sundays. Then {{he wore a}} dark suit that showed the lithe {{movement}} of his body. There was a clean, clear-cut look about him. He went on with his thinking to her. Suddenly he reached for a Bible. Miriam liked the way he reached up--so sharp, straight to the mark. He turned the pages quickly, and read her a chapter of St. John. As {{he sat in the}} armchair reading, intent, his voice only thinking, she {{felt as if he were}} using her unconsciously as a man uses his tools at some work he is bent on. She loved it. And the wistfulness of his voice was like a reaching to something, and it was as if she were what he reached with. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> on the sofa away from him, and yet feeling herself the very instrument his hand grasped. It gave her great pleasure.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{said very}} little, {{and that was}} one of the strangest things about her. But she sat and stared and stared and stared at me, as if I were some sort of curiosity on exhibition, and did not answer {{anything}} I said to her. I was awfully nervous, though I knew from the few words she had said that she was not angry with me; but she kept on staring and staring and staring, and then she suddenly leaned forward and put her arms around me and kissed me. Then <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> in her chair again, slapped her two hands upon her knees, and said, speaking to herself, 'It shall be done. I am a fool to have a doubt about it.' And then she went without another word. Now was not that simply amazing? Did she come here, and did she act in that way?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, you have," [...] {{continued}} Camilla. Arabella conceived {{herself at}} this moment to be situated in so delicate a position, that it was best that her sister should talk about it, and that she herself should hold her tongue,--with the exception, perhaps, of a hint here and there which might be of assistance; for Arabella completely understood that the prize was now to be hers, if the prize could be rescued out of the Stanbury clutches. She was aware,--no one better aware,--how her sister had interfered with her early hopes, and was sure, in her own mind, that all her disappointment had come from fratricidal rivalry {{on the part of}} Camilla. It had never, however, been open to her to quarrel with Camilla. There they were, linked together, and together they must fight their battles. As two pigs may be seen at the same trough, each striving to take the delicacies of the banquet from the other, and yet enjoying always the warmth of the same dunghill in amicable contiguity, so had these young ladies lived in sisterly friendship, while each was striving to take a husband from the other. They had understood the position, and, though for years back they had talked about Mr. Gibson, they had never quarrelled; but now, in these latter days of the Stanbury interference, there had come tacitly to be something of an understanding between them that, if any fighting were still possible on the subject, one must be put forward and the other must yield. There had been no spoken agreement, but Arabella quite understood that she was to be put forward. It was for her to take up the running, and to win, if possible, against the Stanbury filly. That was her view, and she was inclined to give Camilla credit for acting in accordance with it with honesty and zeal. She felt, therefore, that her words on the present occasion ought to be few. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>back</b> in her corner of the sofa, and was intent on her work, and shewed by the pensiveness of her brow that there were thoughts within her bosom of which she was not disposed to speak. [...] "You must have heard a great deal," [...] said Camilla, laughing. [...] "You must know how poor Mr. Gibson has been abused, because he wouldn't--" ...|$|E
50|$|Sam {{contacted}} Nicole and {{she visited}} him in prison. It was, however, a deception. Sam escaped using her as leverage, and later held his younger sister hostage in the family home and tied her up. After a failed escape attempt, Sam threatened to pour boiling water over Nicole if she didn't tell him where Sophie was. Russ came home and found Nicole, who told him what had happened. Russ raced to The Dog in The Pond but arrived too late - several people were dead, including Russ's girlfriend Sophie. Nicole and Russ both later refused to attend Sam's funeral. Nicole eventually reversed her decision and attended, seeing her parents as the only others there. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> at the <b>back,</b> emotionless, gave her mother a comforting hand and {{told her she was}} sorry her son had died.|$|R
60|$|Miss Macroyd laughed {{all through}} her talk, {{and she was}} in a final burst of {{laughing}} when the train slowed into Stamford. There a girl came into the car trailing her skirts with a sort of vivid debility and overturning some minor pieces of hand-baggage which her draperies swept out of their shelter beside the chairs. She had to take one of the seats which back {{against the wall of the}} state-room, where she must face the whole length of the car. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> weakly fallen <b>back</b> in the chair and motionless, as if almost unconscious; but after the train had begun to stir she started up, and with a quick flinging of her veil aside turned to look out of the window. In the flying instant Verrian saw a colorless face with pinched and sunken eyes under a worn-looking forehead, and a withered mouth whose lips parted feebly.|$|R
60|$|That {{was when}} we were coming through the hall, and the place was dim, and I could see her only vaguely. The thing which called my {{attention}} to her the second time was, that at a table beyond ours were two very pretty girls, and this great lady came in and sat down between them and me and blotted out my view. She had a handsome face, {{and she was very}} finely formed--perfectly formed, I should say. But she made everybody around her look trivial and commonplace. Ladies near her looked like children, and the men about her looked mean. They looked like failures; and they looked as if they felt so, too. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> with her <b>back</b> to us. I never saw such a back in my life. I would have so liked to see the moon rise over it. The whole congregation waited, under one pretext or another, till she finished her dinner and went out; they wanted to see her at full altitude, and they found it worth tarrying for. She filled one's idea of what an empress ought to be, when she rose up in her unapproachable grandeur and moved superbly out of that place.|$|R
