5|$|The main {{method of}} Candides satire is to {{contrast}} ironically great tragedy and comedy. The <b>story</b> <b>does</b> not invent or exaggerate evils of the world—it displays real ones starkly, allowing Voltaire to simplify subtle philosophies and cultural traditions, highlighting their flaws. Thus Candide derides optimism, for instance, with a deluge of horrible, historical (or at least plausible) events {{with no apparent}} redeeming qualities.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} team {{wanted to}} include iconic {{aspects of the}} Batman mythos, and decided early on in production to have Conroy, Hamill, and Sorkin reprise their roles in Dini's Batman: The Animated Series as Batman, the Joker, and Harley Quinn, respectively. Hamill has thousands of lines of dialogue in the game, and Conroy has relatively few in comparison. After seeing character models of the Joker's Arkham Asylum appearance, Hamill decided to portray the character as dark and gritty while retaining a clownish and playful nature. Although the game features references to plot events in both The Animated Series and Batman comics, the <b>story</b> <b>does</b> not directly follow any singular story or depiction of the character.|$|E
5|$|With his capital {{coming under}} {{bombardment}} from gun batteries {{set up by}} Royal Navy sailors organised into naval brigades, Ernouf marched to meet the British on the plain at Matabar on 3 February. Forming up, Ernouf attacked the British and initially drove them back, before superior numbers forced him to retire after he was outflanked by Wale's force attacking from the north. General Wale {{was wounded in the}} attack, in which his men suffered 40 casualties. One eyewitness, an Irish sailor from HMS Alfred, claimed that Ernouf had laid a large land mine along his line of retreat and planned to detonate it as the British advanced but was prevented from doing so when Beckwith spotted the trap and refused to be drawn into it, although this <b>story</b> <b>does</b> not appear in other accounts. While Ernouf was retreating, Commodore Fahie seized the opportunity to attack the undefended town of Basse-Terre, landing with a force of Royal Marines and capturing the town, cutting off Ernouf's route of escape. Isolated and surrounded, the French general requested a truce at 08:00 on 4 February to bury the dead from the battle the day before. This was accepted, and on 5 February he formally surrendered.|$|E

25|$|Samuel Madden's Memoirs of the Twentieth Century (1733) {{in which}} a narrator from 1728 is given a series of state {{documents}} from 19971998 by his guardian angel, a plot device which is reminiscent of later time travel novels. However, the <b>story</b> <b>does</b> not explain how the angel obtained these documents.|$|E
25|$|One Blade of Grass {{depicts a}} {{situation}} in which the rich wife of a military officer treats a child servant like a slave or actually more like a household appliance. There's a lot of hyperbole in the treatment of master-servant relations here, but the <b>story</b> <b>does</b> a good job at bringing out the features of oppression that one often finds in countries where income inequalities are extreme.|$|E

25|$|In {{another version}} of the story, it is stated by Frederick van Bassen who was a Norwegian historian, that the saviour of King Malcolm III was {{actually}} a Malcolm, son of Friskin, however in other respects the story is the same. This <b>story</b> <b>does</b> not fit with the historical record, however it is of ancient origin and a grain of truth must in some way relate it to real events. A Magbie or MacBeth Hill curiously or coincidentally exists above Stewarton near Old Coreshill Castle. Sir William Montgomery of Giffin acquired these lands, his father being Troilus Montgomery.|$|E
25|$|La Grande Illusion, a 1937 film by Jean Renoir, {{depicts the}} story of two French {{officers}} of the First World War sent to a prisoners’ camp in Germany. They decide to escape by digging a tunnel in perilous conditions. After several aborted escape attempts and repeated transfers, they are placed in a mountain fortress. The <b>story</b> <b>does</b> not portray negative characters: soldiers or guards, the Germans are good guys, while the Allied prisoners perform their duties conscientiously but without excessive heroism. As shown, the prisoners’ camps of 1914-18 do not give the impression of a frightening inferno (at least the officers’ camps).|$|E
25|$|Their <b>story</b> <b>does</b> {{not appear}} to have been widely known in the later Middle Ages, either. There is no mention of the couple in Dante; Chaucer makes a very brief {{reference}} in the Wife of Bath's Prologue (lines 677–8), but no more. One of the first people to show a deeper interest in the couple appears to have been Petrarch, who owned an early 14th-century manuscript of the couple's letters. This silence on what is today seen as a particularly touching story is perhaps surprising, given the Renaissance ideal of courtly love – but {{it is possible that the}} story of Abelard and Héloïse could not be appropriately fitted into the ideals of the lover's devotion to the chaste and unattainable lady.|$|E

25|$|Not {{long after}} his condemnation, Photios had reingratiated himself with Basil, and became tutor to the Byzantine emperor's children. From {{surviving}} letters of Photios written during his exile at the Skepi monastery, {{it appears that}} the ex-patriarch brought pressure to bear on the Byzantine emperor to restore him. Ignatios's biographer argues that Photios forged a document relating to the genealogy and rule of Basil's family, and had it placed in the imperial library where a friend of his was a librarian. According to this document, the Byzantine emperor's ancestors were not mere peasants as everyone believed but descendants of the Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia. True or not, this <b>story</b> <b>does</b> reveal Basil's dependence on Photios for literary and ideological matters. Following Photios's recall, Ignatios and the ex-patriarch met, and publicly expressed their reconciliation. When Ignatios died on October 23, 877, {{it was a matter of}} course that his old opponent replaced him on the patriarchal throne three days later. Shaun Tougher asserts that from this point on Basil no longer simply depended on Photios, but in fact he was dominated by him.|$|E
25|$|Several {{disparate}} Egyptian texts {{address a}} similar theme: {{the birth of}} a divinely fathered child who is heir to the kingship. The earliest known appearance of such a <b>story</b> <b>does</b> {{not appear to be a}} myth but an entertaining folktale, found in the Middle Kingdom Westcar Papyrus, about the birth of the first three kings of Egypt's Fifth Dynasty. In that story, the three kings are the offspring of Ra and a human woman. The same theme appears in a firmly religious context in the New Kingdom, when the rulers Hatshepsut, Amenhotep III, and Ramesses II depicted in temple reliefs their own conception and birth, in which the god Amun is the father and the historical queen the mother. By stating that the king originated among the gods and was deliberately created by the most important god of the period, the story gives a mythical background to the king's coronation, which appears alongside the birth story. The divine connection legitimizes the king's rule and provides a rationale for his role as intercessor between gods and humans.|$|E

500|$|Another theme found {{throughout}} {{the book is the}} hardship of life in the wild. Reviews have note how the <b>story</b> <b>does</b> not cover up the hardships of Clan life. School Library Journal commented on how the story describes the hardships and difficulties of a feral cat's life in detail and how there is no sugarcoating of the violence. Fantasy Book Review also wrote [...] "Erin Hunter does not spare the reader from the grim realities of living in the wild". Kirkus Reviews noted that doing so shows how the Clans are on the brink of survival.|$|E
500|$|... "It's an {{illusion}} to believe himself {{active in the}} <b>story.</b> <b>Does</b> he think he's changing something, watching news programmes, or {{lying on his back}} on the sofa on Sunday afternoon, reading more opinion columns of ungrounded certainties, more long articles about what really lies behind this or that development, or what is surely going to happen next, predictions forgotten as soon as they are read, well before events disprove them?" [...] Physically, Perowne is neither above nor outside the fray but at an angle to it; emotionally his own intelligence makes him apathetic, he can see both sides of the argument, and his beliefs are characterised by a series of hard choices rather than sure certainties.|$|E
