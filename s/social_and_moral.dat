5|$|Iran {{temporarily}} blocked access on December 3, 2006, to YouTube {{and several}} other sites, after declaring them as violating <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> codes of conduct. The YouTube block came after a video was posted online that appeared to show an Iranian soap opera star having sex. The block was later lifted and then reinstated after Iran's 2009 presidential election. In 2012, Iran reblocked access, along with access to Google, after the controversial film Innocence of Muslims trailer was released on YouTube.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{have drawn}} {{on a range}} of sources on Henry, {{including}} the accounts of chroniclers; other documentary evidence, including early pipe rolls; and surviving buildings and architecture. The three main chroniclers to describe the events of Henry's life were William of Malmesbury, Orderic Vitalis, and Henry of Huntingdon, but each incorporated extensive <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> commentary into their accounts and borrowed a range of literary devices and stereotypical events from other popular works. Other chroniclers include Eadmer, Hugh the Chanter, Abbot Suger, and the authors of the Welsh Brut. Not all royal documents from the period have survived, but {{there are a number of}} royal acts, charters, writs, and letters, along with some early financial records. Some of these have since been discovered to be forgeries, and others had been subsequently amended or tampered with.|$|E
5|$|The {{books and}} letters written by Bahá'u'lláh cover {{religious}} doctrine, the proclamation of his claims, <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> teachings {{as well as}} Bahá'í laws; he also wrote many prayers. Jináb-i-Fádil-i-Mázindarání, analyzing Baha'u'llah's writings, states that {{he wrote in the}} different styles or categories including the interpretation of religious scripture, the enunciation of laws and ordinances, mystical writings, writings about government and world order, including letters to the kings and rulers of the world, writings about knowledge, philosophy, medicine, and alchemy, writings calling for education, good character and virtues, and writing about social teachings. All of his works are considered by Bahá'ís to be revelation, even those that were written before his announcement of his prophetic claim. Some of his better known works that have been translated into English include Gleanings, the Hidden Words, the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and the Kitáb-i-Íqán.|$|E

25|$|Defoe was {{particularly}} inclined to use pseudonyms, acquiring {{in this way}} the {{reputation as one of the}} most chameleon-like English writers.

25|$|Elizabeth Blackwell (3 February 1821– 31 May 1910) was a British-born physician, notable as {{the first}} woman to receive a medical degree in the United States, as well {{as the first}} woman on the UK Medical Register.

25|$|American {{psychiatrist}} Thomas Szasz {{insisted that}} psychiatric hospitals are like prisons, not proper hospitals, and that psychiatrists who subject others to coercion function as judges and jailers, not physicians. The French historian Michel Foucault is widely {{known for his}} comprehensive critique of the use and abuse of the mental hospital system in Madness and Civilization. He argued that Tuke and Pinel's asylum was a symbolic recreation of the condition of a child under a bourgeois family. It was a microcosm symbolizing the massive structures of bourgeois society and its values: relations of Family–Children (paternal authority), Fault–Punishment (immediate justice), Madness–Disorder (<b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> order).|$|E

25|$|One of Asturias' {{most famous}} novels, El Señor Presidente, {{describes}} life under a ruthless dictator. Asturias' very public opposition to dictatorial rule led to him spending {{much of his}} later life in exile, both in South America and in Europe. The book that is sometimes described as his masterpiece, Hombres de maíz (Men of Maize), is a defense of Mayan culture and customs. Asturias combined his extensive knowledge of Mayan beliefs with his political convictions, channeling them into a life of commitment and solidarity. His work is often identified with the <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> aspirations of the Guatemalan people.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 1920s and 1930s {{a series}} of conferences, congresses and {{meetings}} were held, dealing with sexual education and prostitution. Much of this attention {{was in response to}} the 1926 passage of the Reglamento para el Ejercicio de la Prostitución (Regulation for the Practice of Prostitution), an ordinance requiring prostitutes to register with authorities and submit to inspection and surveillance. But it also may have been part of a normal phenomenon which occurs at the end of conflict. Katherine Elaine Bliss has noted that often, at the end of armed conflict, citizens turn to reordering the <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> codes, regulating sexuality and redefining social roles.|$|E
25|$|The {{end of the}} seventeenth-century and the {{beginning}} of the eighteenth-century witnessed an increasing concern for vices and immorality spreading all over the country. There was a general sense of falling into the worst possible form of behaviour and a common feeling that avarice, vice, idleness, blasphemy, vagrancy and crime were all entangles together pushing people (poor and wealthy, young and old) into a slippery slope to damnation. A drastic social reformation was required and, at the end of the seventeenth-century, societies for the reformation of manners started emerging with a rank of proper paid agents operating locally. Indeed, Defoe was just one of the many eighteenth-century voices believing that at least part of the falling of the offender was due to a weakening of the <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> values of the English society.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The use of foul {{language}} becomes increasingly popular among youth, yet scientific {{research on this}} topic is grossly missing in the literature. This longitudinal study examined the developmental change of {{foul language}} use and its relations to emotional competence, <b>social</b> competence, <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> competence over high school years. Methods: Data were from a six-year longitudinal study between grade 7 and grade 12 with an annual assessment on 3, 328 Hong Kong adolescents (mean age = 12. 59 +/-. 74 years). Multiplegroup latent growth curve modeling based on six waves of longitudinal data were conducted. Results: Results showed {{that the use of}} foul language increased, but the increase rate slowed down over time; males showed faster increase rate yet faster deceleration than did females. In addition, changes in emotional competence, <b>social</b> competence, <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> competence negatively predicted the change in use of foul language across males and females, respectively. Conclusions: Adolescents are vulnerable to increasing their use of foul language. However, promoting emotional competence, <b>social</b> competence, <b>and</b> <b>moral</b> competence could be helpful to minimize the increasing trend of use of foul language.
