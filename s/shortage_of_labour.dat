5|$|In early January 1944, {{in order}} to rectify a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> in the primary {{production}} sector of the New Zealand economy, the New Zealand Government, {{in consultation with the}} United States and the United Kingdom, decided that it was necessary to release manpower from the military back into the civilian workforce. After some debate, it was decided that this manpower would come from the 3rd Division, while the 2nd New Zealand Division, which was fighting in Italy, would be allowed to remain intact.|$|E
5|$|The {{reintegration}} of French prisoners into {{civilian life}} was facilitated by {{a network of}} Maisons du Prisonnier (Prisoner Houses), established across France, which would help them readjust and find work. Generally, prisoners generally found it easy to regain their pre-war jobs because of the <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour.</b> The government had hoped that returning prisoners of war would be more sympathetic to the Vichy regime, but prisoners coming back were not noticeably more loyal to Vichy than other groups.|$|E
5|$|World War I {{broke out}} in July 1914. By September 1914, the war had spread to Africa as the British and Belgians began a long {{military}} campaign against the German colonial army in German East Africa. In Nyasaland, the major effect {{of the war was}} massive recruitment of Africans to serve as porters in support of the Allied armies. Porters lived in extremely poor conditions which left them exposed to disease and mortality rates among them during the campaigns were high. At the same time, the recruitment of porters created a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> which increased the economic pressures on Africans in Nyasaland. Millenarians at the time believed that World War I would be a form of Armageddon, which they believed would destroy the colonial powers and pave the way for the emergence of independent African states.|$|E
25|$|Most people {{relocated}} {{to the nearby}} villages of Freshwater or Placentia. However what little had been paid as compensation (usually {{no more than a}} few thousand dollars for homeowners in Argentia) proved inadequate for building equivalent new homes due to severe wartime <b>shortages</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> and materials.|$|R
50|$|Work on the {{cemetery}} was halted by wartime <b>shortages</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> and materials, but recommenced in 1945 when {{a survey of}} {{the cemetery}} noted lavatory blocks for men and women, two shelter sheds, a timber sexton's cottage, a timber tool room, motor shed and men's room. A brick staff amenities block was constructed in 1954.|$|R
50|$|<b>Shortages</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> {{for the war}} economy led to a Concentration Camps Inspectorate (CCI) decree on March 26, 1942, {{which was}} {{distributed}} to all camp commandants. In 1942, the CCI was incorporated into the SS-Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt under SS-Obergruppenführer Oswald Pohl as Amt D under SS-Brigadeführer Richard Glücks. The decree was signed by Arthur Liebehenschel, acting in Glücks' stead.|$|R
5|$|Southern Rhodesia's {{other main}} {{economic}} arm, farming, performed less strongly during the war, {{partly because the}} Chartered Company prioritised the strategically important mines {{at the behest of}} British officials. Southern Rhodesian farmers were optimistic at the outbreak of war, surmising that the Empire would become desperate for food and that they would be essentially immune to inflation because they grew their own crops. While these conclusions were on the whole accurate, logistical complications made it difficult for Rhodesian food to be exported, and as in mining there was often a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour.</b> There were a number of drives to increase agricultural yield with the hope of feeding more people in Britain, but because Southern Rhodesia was so far away it was difficult for the colony to make much of an impact. One of the main culinary contributions the territory made to the British wartime marketplace was Rhodesian butter, which first reached England in February 1917.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{reason for}} the {{constant}} <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> was that, with large amounts of cheap land available and lots of landowners searching for workers, free European immigrants were able to become landowners themselves after a relatively short time, thus increasing the need for workers.|$|E
25|$|Since Macau has {{an economy}} driven by tourism, 14.6% of the {{workforce}} is employed in restaurants and hotels, and 10.3% in the gambling industry. With the opening of several casino resorts and other major constructions underway, many sectors reportedly experience a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour,</b> and the government seeks to import labour from neighbouring regions.|$|E
25|$|As often {{proved to}} be the case in Hobart's history, the world {{advanced}} faster than the city. Just as Hobart Town was growing to dominate the international shipbuilding trade, <b>shortages</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> struck the industry, as men migrated en masse to the Victorian goldfields, and the shift towards steam and steel in shipbuilding undermined Hobart's production of quality wooden built ships.|$|R

25|$|The Swan River Settlement (as Western Australia was {{originally}} known), centred on Perth, {{was founded in}} 1829. The colony suffered from a long-term <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour,</b> and by 1850 local capitalists had succeeded in persuading London to send convicts. (Transportation did not end until 1868.) New Zealand was part of New South Wales until 1840 when it became a separate colony.|$|E

25|$|Judith Wright {{was born}} in Armidale, New South Wales. The eldest child of Phillip Wright and his first wife, Ethel, she {{spent most of her}} {{formative}} years in Brisbane and Sydney. Wright was of Cornish ancestry. After the early death of her mother, she lived with her aunt and then boarded at New England Girls' School after her father's remarriage in 1929. After graduating, Wright studied Philosophy, English, Psychology and History at the University of Sydney. At the beginning of World War II, she returned to her father's station to help during the <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> caused by the war.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} {{situation at the}} time that TV was established in Australia exerted a pivotal influence on the foundation and subsequent history of the industry. When {{the decision was made to}} go ahead with granting the first licences for broadcast TV in the early 1950s, Australia was in a recession, with severe <b>shortages</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> and materials and an underdeveloped heavy industrial base, and in this context TV was seen as a drain away from more fundamental projects.|$|R
25|$|Melbourne Trades Hall {{was opened}} in 1859 with Trades and Labour Councils and Trades Halls opening in all cities and most {{regional}} {{towns in the}} following forty years. During the 1880s Trade unions developed among shearers, miners, and stevedores (wharf workers), but soon spread to cover almost all blue-collar jobs. <b>Shortages</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> led to high wages for a prosperous skilled working class, whose unions demanded and got an eight-hour day and other benefits unheard of in Europe.|$|R

25|$|As Perak {{continued}} to increase its mining operations, it suffered a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour.</b> Looking to solve the problem, Malay administrator Long Jaafar invited the Chinese in Penang to work in Perak, particularly at Larut. By the 1840s, Perak's Chinese population exploded. The new immigrants {{more often than not}} were members of Chinese secret societies. Two of the largest were Ghee Hin and Hai San. These two groups regularly tried to increase their influence in Perak and this resulted in frequent skirmishes. These skirmishes were getting out of hand, so that even Ngah Ibrahim, the Menteri Besar, or chief minister, was unable to enforce the rule of law.|$|E
25|$|The English {{government}} {{handled the}} crisis well, {{and the country}} did not experience the extreme reactions that were seen elsewhere in Europe. The most immediate consequence was {{a halt to the}} campaigns of the Hundred Years' War. In the long term, the decrease in population caused a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour,</b> with subsequent rise in wages, resisted by the landowners, which caused deep resentment among the lower classes. The Peasants' Revolt of 1381 was largely a result of this resentment, and even though the rebellion was suppressed, in the long term serfdom was ended in England. The Black Death also affected artistic and cultural efforts, and may have helped advance the use of the vernacular.|$|E
25|$|The Finns did not {{pay much}} {{attention}} to the living conditions of the Soviet POWs {{at the beginning of the}} war, as the war was expected to be of short duration. The quantity and quality of camp personnel was very low, as the more qualified men were at the front. It was not until the middle of 1942 that the quantity and quality of camp personnel was improved. There was a <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> in Finland and authorities assigned POWs to forest and agricultural work, as well as the construction of fortification lines. Some Soviet officers cooperated with the Finnish authorities and were released from prison by the end of the war.|$|E

5|$|The {{demobilisation}} of the Australian military after World War II involved discharging almost 600,000 men {{and women}} from the military, supporting their transition to civilian life and reducing the three armed services to peacetime strengths. Planning for the demobilisation process began in 1942 and thousands of service{{men and women}} were discharged {{in the last years of}} the war in response to <b>shortages</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> in the domestic war economy. The general demobilisation of the military began in October 1945 and was completed in February 1947. The demobilisation process was largely successful, though some military personnel stationed in the South West Pacific complained that their repatriation to Australia was too slow.|$|R
25|$|The Black Death also {{affected}} {{arts and culture}} significantly. It was inevitable that a catastrophe of such proportions would affect some of the greater building projects, {{as the amount of}} available labour fell sharply. The building of the cathedrals of Ely and Exeter was temporarily halted in the years immediately following the first outbreak of the plague. The <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> also helped advance the transition from the Decorated style of building to the less elaborate Perpendicular style. The Black Death may also have promoted the use of vernacular English, as the number of teachers proficient in French dwindled. This, in turn, would have contributed to the late-fourteenth century flowering of English literature, represented by writers such as Geoffrey Chaucer and John Gower.|$|E
25|$|Another notable {{consequence}} of the Black Death was the raising of the real wage of England (due to the <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> {{as a result of}} the reduction in population), a trait shared across Western Europe, which in general led to a real wage in 1450 that was unmatched in most countries until the 19th or 20th century. The higher wages for workers combined with sinking prices on grain products led to a problematic economic situation for the gentry. As a result, they started to show an increased interest for offices like justice of the peace, sheriff and member of parliament. The gentry took advantage of their new positions and a more systematic corruption than before spread. A result of this was that the gentry as a group became highly disliked by commoners.|$|E
500|$|Radical {{rebuilding}} schemes {{poured in}} for the gutted City and were encouraged by Charles. If it had been rebuilt under some of these plans, London would have rivalled Paris in Baroque magnificence (see Evelyn's plan on the right). The Crown and the City authorities attempted to establish [...] "to whom all the houses and ground did in truth belong" [...] to negotiate with their owners about compensation for the large-scale remodelling that these plans entailed, but that unrealistic idea had to be abandoned. Exhortations to bring workmen and measure the plots on which the houses had stood were mostly ignored by people worried about day-to-day survival, {{as well as by}} those who had left the capital; for one thing, with the <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> following the fire, it was impossible to secure workmen for the purpose. Apart from Wren and Evelyn, it is known that Robert Hooke, Valentine Knight, and Richard Newcourt proposed rebuilding plans.|$|E

The issue is seen {{from the perspective of the}} dynamics of development in what was in 1900 an overwhelmingly land-abundant region characterised by <b>shortages</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> and capital, by perhaps surprisingly extensive indigenous market activities and by varying but often low levels of political centralisation. The differential impact of French and British rule is explored, but it is argued that a bigger determinant of the differential evolution of poverty, welfare and structural change was the contrast between “settler” and “peasant” economies...|$|R

50|$|After World War II it {{was decided}} to replace the London Underground trains that {{remained}} with hand-operated sliding doors. R Stock was ordered to replace such trains on the District line and the LPTB considered 200 cars were needed, but due to the <b>shortages</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> and materials following the war only 143 new cars were authorised. Some Q stock trailers that had been built in 1938 were converted into R Stock driving motor (DM) cars. The new cars were designated R47 and built by Birmingham RC&W and Gloucester RC&W and the 82 Q Stock trailers converted by Gloucester RC&W from Q38 trailer were designated R38/1. The first car arrived in 1949 and entered service in 1950.|$|R
500|$|Rapid {{expansion}} of plantations in the 19th century {{increased demand for}} African slaves {{at a time when}} supplies were reduced. The supply <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> for production was exacerbated by the British abolition of trade in slaves in the Slave Trade Act 1807. The population consisted of 2,500 whites, 2,500 freed blacks, and 77,000 slaves. Ethnically, there were 34,462 African-born as against 39,956 [...] "creole Negroes" [...] by 1823 in Demerara and Essequibo. Treatment of slaves were markedly different from owner to owner, and from plantation to plantation. Plantations managed by agents and attorneys for absentee owners were common. Caucasian owners and managers were prevalent, and there were very few mixed-race [...] "mulattoes" [...] who advanced to become managers and owners. Lower-class whites and coloureds were considered [...] "superior", giving them access to skilled work. Blacks who performed skilled work, or worked within households and enjoyed greater autonomy, were regarded as having higher-status than other slaves. Slaves who toiled in the fields would work under drivers also slaves, but who had delegated authority of plantation overseers.|$|E
500|$|Stanley, as Port Jackson {{was soon}} renamed, officially became {{the seat of}} {{government}} in 1845. Early in its history, Stanley had a negative reputation due to cargo-shipping losses; only in emergencies would ships rounding Cape Horn stop at the port. Nevertheless, the Falklands' geographic location proved ideal for ship repairs and the [...] "Wrecking Trade", the business of selling and buying shipwrecks and their cargoes. Aside from this trade, commercial interest in the archipelago was minimal due to the low-value hides of the feral cattle roaming the pastures. Economic growth began only after the Falkland Islands Company, which bought out Lafone's failing enterprise in 1851, successfully introduced Cheviot sheep for wool farming, spurring other farms to follow suit. The high cost of importing materials, combined with the <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> and consequent high wages, meant the ship repair trade became uncompetitive. After 1870, it declined as the replacement of sail ships by steamships was accelerated by the low cost of coal in South America; by 1914, {{with the opening of}} the Panama Canal, the trade effectively ended. In 1881, the Falkland Islands became financially independent of Britain. For more than a century, the Falkland Islands Company dominated the trade and employment of the archipelago; in addition, it owned most housing in Stanley, which greatly benefited from the wool trade with the UK.|$|E
2500|$|The {{greatest}} constraint {{to economic}} development was a chronic <b>shortage</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour.</b> [...] Pushed into {{the interior of the}} island and decimated by alcohol addiction, venereal disease, smallpox, and sleeping sickness, the indigenous Bubi population of Bioko refused to work on plantations. Working their own little cocoa farms gave them a considerable degree of autonomy. Moreover, beginning in the late nineteenth century, the Bubi were protected from the demands of the planters by the Spanish Claretian missionaries, who were very influential in the colony and eventually organised the Bubi into little mission theocracies reminiscent of the famous Jesuit Reductions of Paraguay. Catholic penetration was furthered by two small insurrections in 1898 and 1910 protesting the conscription of forced labour for the plantations. Afterwards the Bubi were disarmed in 1917, and left dependent on the missionaries.|$|E
40|$|Domestic {{demand was}} the main force behind growth in 2007. The high level of both, gross fixed {{investments}} of firms and private consumption, led to extended industrial production capacities and increased demand of imports. Extraordinarily high was the demand for the output of construction firms. Rising employment and wages and the continuing expansion of loans to the household sector supported the private consumption growth. The high levels of capacity utilization coincide with <b>shortages</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour.</b> First responses to this were wage hikes, which pushed the unit labour costs and led to some increase in consumer price inflation. In 2008, expansion of economic activity will continue at only some lower level, driven by investments and consumption. ...|$|R

40|$|Two {{main reasons}} {{underlie}} the increasinginterest in the {{labour market participation}} ofindividuals with disabilities. One stems from employment equity and human rights legislation, which ensures access to the labour market for those with disabilities. Examining differences in labour force par-ticipation, education, and occupation and industry pro-files may allow governments and employers to better target programs and policies for these individuals. A second and equally important reason is to deter-mine how to include more individuals with disabilities in the labour force.
