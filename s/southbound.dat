5|$|The {{northbound}} partial interchange with Willets Point & Bell Boulevards {{leads to}} Cross Island Parkway, while a <b>southbound</b> interchange {{leads to the}} <b>southbound</b> Cross Island Parkway, all before reaching the Throgs Neck Bridge. The expressway then crosses the bridge.|$|E
5|$|Unusually, {{traffic to}} and from the Highway400 {{extension}} enters and exits at the right of the roadway, while traffic {{to and from}} Highway400A/11 simply continues on the same roadway. The interchange is also incomplete; drivers must either use the Forbes Road and Penetanguishene Road interchanges, or continue <b>southbound</b> into Barrie and switch direction at Duckworth Street in order to travel from <b>southbound</b> Highway400A to northbound Highway400 or from <b>southbound</b> Highway400 to northbound Highway400A.|$|E
5|$|According to THSR's April 2017 timetable, {{there are}} 967 train {{services}} per week of operation, with operation times between 06:30 to 24:00 every day. Most <b>southbound</b> trains originate from Nangang station and most northbound trains originate from Zuoying; however, a few trains operate just between Nangang and Taichung or between Taichung and Zuoying. <b>Southbound</b> trains are designated by odd train numbers, and northbound trains by even train numbers.|$|E
5|$|Following this, {{the road}} becomes East 4th Street and heads north-{{northwest}} across the Christina River on a drawbridge. US 13/DE 9 curves northwest and passes under Amtrak's Northeast Corridor railroad line, {{at which point}} northbound US 13 splits from the road by turning northeast on North Church Street at the crossing of a railroad spur. A block later, the concurrency between DE 9 and <b>southbound</b> US 13 ends {{at the point where}} <b>southbound</b> US 13 joins the road from North Spruce Street. DE 9 continues northwest through residential and commercial areas as a four-lane undivided road, entering downtown Wilmington. Here, it intersects US 13 Bus., which is routed on the one-way pair of North Walnut Street northbound and North King Street <b>southbound.</b> In between these two streets, the road runs to the south of the New Castle County Court House.|$|E
5|$|Heather Anderson {{completed}} the trail, <b>southbound,</b> on September 24, 2015, in 54 days 7 hours and 48 minutes.|$|E
5|$|In May 2005 it was {{reported}} that the <b>southbound</b> services had overnight parking facilities for 60 lorries. This was a chargeable service.|$|E
5|$|In Saginaw, the two {{parallel}} streets continue east and meet M-84 which runs north–south along Bay Street. The {{distance between the}} {{two parallel}} streets decreases east of North Carolina Street when Davenport Avenue shifts to the south. The intersection with Hill Street {{marks the beginning of}} the connections to the exit3 interchange along a bend in the I-675 freeway. Hill Street is one-way carrying traffic <b>southbound</b> exiting from <b>southbound</b> I-675 to either direction of M-58. Two blocks east, Michigan Avenue carries traffic northbound under the freeway, connecting to a ramp to northbound I-675 before continuing north through the city of Saginaw. East of this intersection, State Street curves to the north, intersecting Davenport Avenue and merging into the ramp for <b>southbound</b> I-675. A loop ramp across the freeway provides access from northbound I-675 to Davenport Avenue. This interchange complex marks the eastern terminus of M-58.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the three}} {{original}} HOV lanes in Ontario opened on Highway404 in late 2005; {{the other two were}} the lanes on Highway403. In early 2004, construction began on a new ramp to westbound Highway401, curving beneath the <b>southbound</b> lanes of Highway404. On 13 December 2005, the <b>southbound</b> HOV lane was opened to traffic.|$|E
5|$|Originally, a toll {{was paid}} for each {{direction}} of travel with sets of toll booths on both carriageways. In 1997, the northbound toll was doubled (from 40p to 80p) and the <b>southbound</b> toll abolished on the presumption that almost all traffic makes a return journey across the bridge, and that {{the removal of the}} <b>southbound</b> toll would result in a reduction of congestion without reducing revenue.|$|E
5|$|PA 222 {{heads into}} {{downtown}} Allentown, where it splits into a one-way pair at 12th Street. Northbound PA 222 turns south onto 12th Street and east onto Walnut Street while <b>southbound</b> PA 222 runs west along Linden Street to 12th Street, following 12th Street south to Hamilton Street. Walnut Street is two lanes and two-way until 10th Street, where it becomes one-way with two northbound lanes heading east, while Linden Street {{is one way}} <b>southbound</b> with two lanes heading west. The one-way paring continues east past homes and businesses in the downtown area. <b>Southbound</b> PA 222 passes {{to the north of}} the PPL Center sports arena, where the Lehigh Valley Phantoms of the American Hockey League and the Lehigh Valley Steelhawks of the National Arena League play, between 8th and 7th streets. PA 222 intersects 7th Street, which carries <b>southbound</b> PA 145, before it reaches its northern terminus at 6th Street, which carries northbound PA 145.|$|E
5|$|Platform 10 {{was added}} in 1913, as another <b>southbound</b> East Lancashire through platform, which trains {{accessed}} via a short tunnel underneath a rebuilt Butler Street entrance.|$|E
5|$|Platform 9 was {{the main}} <b>southbound</b> East Lancashire through platform, {{containing}} more buildings and linked to the Butler Street station entrance.|$|E
5|$|Route 87 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with U.S. Route 30 in Atlantic City, {{heading to the}} northeast on Huron Avenue, an undivided road with two northbound lanes and three <b>southbound</b> lanes. Immediately after beginning, it passes under the Atlantic City – Brigantine Connector and comes to a ramp that provides access from <b>southbound</b> Route 87 to the <b>southbound</b> connector. From here, the route widens to seven lanes, with two northbound lanes and five <b>southbound</b> lanes. It passes by the Borgata casino, with a ramp from the casino to the northbound direction. The road becomes a four-lane divided highway and passes under a ramp from the Atlantic City – Brigantine Connector to the Borgata before heading under northbound direction of the connector. Here, a ramp from the connector provides access to Route 87. A short distance later, the route comes to the northern terminus of Route 187 and turns north to follow Brigantine Boulevard, which is a four-lane divided highway.|$|E
5|$|Situated {{half a mile}} to {{the north}} of the <b>southbound</b> services, the {{northbound}} services are set back from the motorway. The main building is an unusual design based on curves and circles. Unlike the <b>southbound</b> site, the cash machines are located outside and both the car and lorry parking is to the front of the building.|$|E
5|$|South of Mill Point Road to Roe Highway {{the freeway}} has three lanes in each direction, without any bus lanes except for bus-only ramps at the Canning Bridge interchange. At the Roe Highway interchange, an extra <b>southbound</b> lane is added, {{providing}} four lanes <b>southbound</b> and two lanes northbound, until the Armadale Road/Beeliar Drive interchange in Cockburn, where the freeway {{is reduced to}} two lanes in each direction until Pinjarra Road. Works are currently underway to add an extra lane <b>southbound</b> between Armadale Road/Beeliar Drive, and Russell Road in Hammond Park. The median strip of the freeway north of The Spectacles also houses the Mandurah railway line. A shared pedestrian and bicycle path is built alongside the freeway.|$|E
5|$|<b>Southbound,</b> {{the freeway}} {{is divided into}} two {{carriageway}}s, both of which provide access to the DVP. The outer carriageway also provides access from Sheppard and to Highway401, including the westbound express lanes, while the inner carriageway is intended for DVP-bound traffic. The HOV lane also provides access to westbound Highway401 via a dedicated tunnel, which passes beneath the other <b>southbound</b> lanes.|$|E
5|$|Strong northwesterly winds likely created <b>southbound</b> lake {{currents}} on {{the eastern}} shores, forming beach structures from sediment imported from the north into the lake.|$|E
5|$|The Maugans Avenue diamond {{interchange}} {{may have a}} loop ramp added from westbound Maugans Avenue to <b>southbound</b> I-81.|$|E
5|$|The {{first section}} of Highway404 between Highway 401 and Steeles Avenue opened in late 1977, {{including}} the flyover ramp from <b>southbound</b> Woodbine Avenue.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{has never}} been {{publicly}} signed as Highway400A. Instead, northbound it is indicated as Highway11 and <b>southbound</b> as Highway400.|$|E
5|$|The ramp to the <b>southbound</b> parkway did {{not open}} until December 2008.|$|E
5|$|The station's {{escalators}} and the <b>southbound</b> platform were {{featured in}} the Bollywood hit film Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{becoming}} the NorthSouth Freeway, Route 42 crosses into Gloucester Township, Camden County {{and comes to}} the first numbered exit for County Route 705, which provides access to Route 168. Following that, the freeway reaches the County Route 673 (College Drive) interchange, serving Camden County College {{to the east and}} the Gloucester Premium Outlets to the west. County Route 534 interchanges with a <b>southbound</b> exit and northbound entrance and then Coles Road interchanges with a northbound exit and <b>southbound</b> entrance. Next, Route 42 encounters Exits 9B and 10A for Route 168. Exit 9B serves northbound Route 168 and provides access to the New Jersey Turnpike, and Exit 10A serves <b>southbound</b> Route 168. County Route 681 interchanges after Route 168, with a <b>southbound</b> exit and northbound entrance, and Route 42 enters Gloucester County again in Deptford Township after crossing the South Branch of Big Timber Creek.|$|E
5|$|Access to an air {{ambulance}} base {{is at the}} rear of the site. The site also has a budget-chain hotel located within the service area. In May 2005 it was reported that the <b>southbound</b> services had overnight parking facilities for 100 lorries. This was a chargeable service.|$|E
5|$|After DE 9A, DE 9 enters Wilmington {{and heads}} through urban areas as an {{undivided}} road, crossing Norfolk Southern's Shellpot Secondary before intersecting the northbound direction of US 13. At this point, DE 9 splits into a one-way pair with the northbound direction becoming concurrent with northbound US 13 on one-way New Castle Avenue and the <b>southbound</b> direction following <b>southbound</b> US 13 on South Heald Street, briefly turning east along with northbound US 13 on D Street {{at the south}} end of the one-way pair. The one-way pair, which carries two lanes in each direction, passes rowhomes and businesses, with New Castle Avenue merging onto South Heald Street. Here, US 13/DE 9 continue north-northeast on four-lane undivided South Heald Street, coming to an intersection with the northern terminus of DE 9A.|$|E
5|$|After the US127 interchange, I-75 turns northward, {{and passes}} {{to the east}} of Grayling. There are a pair of {{interchanges}} on either end of town for BL I-75, and the southern one is a partial interchange; only northbound I-75 traffic may access the business loop and traffic entering the freeway may only access <b>southbound</b> I-75. There is no interchange further north for M-72; access to that highway is provided through the business loop. On the north side of Grayling, there is a full interchange for BL I-75/M-93 that provides the <b>southbound</b> I-75 connection to M-72 as well as access from both directions to the Hartwick Pines State Park.|$|E
5|$|Approaching I-96 {{from the}} south, the freeway passes {{east of the}} DeltaPlex Arena, and it median widens further {{across the river from}} Comstock Riverside Park in Walker. An extra lane is added on the left, {{widening}} the freeway to four lanes. Unsigned I-296 occupies the left two lanes that form the left exit for I-96 from US131. At the split between I-296 and US131, I-296 curves northwest, and US131 curves northeast to follow a bend in the Grand River. Once I-296 diverges from US131, the highway crosses a rail line owned by CSX Transportation and passes over West River Drive. To the northwest of these crossings, exits emerge on the right for eastbound I-96 and the left for northbound M-37 (Alpine Avenue). Past these exits, I-296 merges into westbound I-96 and terminates. <b>Southbound</b> unsigned I-296 begins where the ramps to US131 <b>southbound</b> split from eastbound I-96 at the Alpine Avenue overpass, merging with <b>southbound</b> US131 north of Ann Street.|$|E
5|$|As the {{original}} freeway begins, it passes under an extension to the 1925 Avenue 26 Bridge, {{one of four}} bridges over the Arroyo Seco that predate the parkway's construction. A <b>southbound</b> exit and northbound entrance at Avenue 26 complement the Figueroa Street ramps, and similar ramps connect Pasadena to both directions of I-5. SR 110 continues northeast alongside the Arroyo Seco, passing under the Gold Line light rail and Pasadena Avenue before junctioning Avenue 43 at {{the first of many}} folded diamond interchanges that feature extremely tight (right-in/right-out) curves on the exit and entrance ramps. The next interchange, at Avenue 52, is a normal diamond interchange, and soon after is Via Marisol, where the northbound side has standard diamond ramps, but on the <b>southbound</b> side Avenue 57 acts as a folded diamond connection. The 1926 Avenue 60 Bridge is the second original bridge, and is another folded diamond, with <b>southbound</b> traffic using Shults Street to connect. The 1895 Santa Fe Arroyo Seco Railroad Bridge (now Gold Line) lies just beyond, and after that is a half diamond interchange at Marmion Way/Avenue 64 with access towards Los Angeles only. After the freeway passes under the 1912 York Boulevard Bridge, the pre-parkway bridge, <b>southbound</b> connections between the freeway and cross street can be made via Salonica Street. As the Arroyo Seco curves north to pass west of downtown Pasadena, the Arroyo Seco Parkway instead curves east, crossing the stream into South Pasadena. A single northbound offramp on the Los Angeles side of the bridge curves left under the bridge to Bridewell Street, the parkway's west-side frontage road.|$|E
5|$|At Ditmas Avenue, the Culver Ramp {{ends and}} the {{underground}} line becomes elevated. This is a three-track Dual Contracts elevated on the former BMT line over McDonald (formerly Gravesend) Avenue. Just before the station, the <b>southbound</b> local track merges into the <b>southbound</b> express track, while the northbound express track becomes the El's bidirectional center express track. During the 1990s and 2000s, the center express track in this section was occasionally used for non-revenue testing. After Avenue X station, a ramp diverges to the surface {{for access to the}} Culver Yard of the Coney Island Yards complex. At this point the Culver Line narrows to a two-track structure bearing one more station–Neptune Avenue–before curving into West Eighth Street–New York Aquarium station on Coney Island.|$|E
