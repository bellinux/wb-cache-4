40|$|Summary Methane {{emission}} {{rates from}} rice-vegetated paddy fields followed a seasonal pattern different {{to that of}} weed-covered or unvegetated fields. Presence of rice plants stimulated the emission of CH 4 both in the laboratory and in the field. In unvegetated paddy fields CH 4 was emitted almost exlusively by ebullition. By contrast, in rice-vegetated fields more than 90 % of the CH 4 emission was due to plant-mediated transport. Rice plants stimulated methanogenesis in the <b>submerged</b> <b>soil,</b> but also enhanced the CH 4 oxidation rates within the rhizosphere so that only 23 % of the produced CH 4 was emitted. Gas bubbles in vegetated paddy soils contained lower CH 4 mixing ratios than in unvegetated fields. Weed plants were also efficient in mediating gas exchange between <b>submerged</b> <b>soil</b> and atmosphere, but did not stimulate methanogenesis. Weed plants caused a relatively high redox potential in the <b>submerged</b> <b>soil</b> so that 95 % of the produced CH 4 was oxidized and did not reach the atmosphere. The e mission of CH 4 was stimulated, however, when the cultures were incubated under gas atmospheres containing acetylene or consisting of O 2 -free nitrogen. (IFU...|$|E

40|$|The {{decomposition}} and {{accumulation of}} organic materials in <b>submerged</b> (anaerobic) <b>soils</b> and sediments differ considerably {{from those in}} their aerobic counterparts. This {{is caused by the}} lack of oxygen or anaerobiosis. Compared to aerobic soils, there is preferential accumulation of organic matter in <b>submerged</b> rice <b>soils.</b> This paper reviews the current literature to establish basis or bases for organic matter accumulation in wetland soils and sediments. The decomposition or destruction of organic materials is lessened and incomplete, and the humification of organic matter is decreased under flooded conditions. Consequently, the overall organic matter decomposition rates are slower in <b>submerged</b> <b>soils</b> than those in aerobic soils and this results in net accumulation of organic matter in soils or sites that remain flooded for several years. Also, high organic matter soils or Histosols are developed in permanently waterlogged sites or soils because the rate of organic matter destruction is slower than its accumulation. The balance between organic matter inputs and decomposition is the primary determinant of organic matter accumulation or depletion. Several hypotheses have been postulated to explain the accumulation of organic matter in <b>submerged</b> <b>soils.</b> They include the deleterious effects on microbial activity of reduction products produced such as hydrogen sulfide or volatile fatty acids and toxic concentrations of ammonia, aluminium, iron, and other cations in soil solution. The absence of electron acceptors such as iron oxides and hydroxides in <b>submerged</b> <b>soils</b> and sediments slows down organic matter oxidation and mineralization. Formation of recalcitrant complex organic molecules with organic matter fractions, e. g., through enrichment of organic matter with phenolics in intensified irrigated rice production system, may render them less available for microbial attack and utilization. Moreover, the net primary productivity of wetlands is higher than other ecosystems.
