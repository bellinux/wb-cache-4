In order to accommodate the intended indoor and outdoor uses of thiacloprid in Belgium, the EMS proposed to raise the existing MRLs for thiacloprid in <b>spinach</b> and <b>similar</b> leaves group or only in spinach and beet leaves to 0. 15 mg/kg. Belgium drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA, the submitted residue trials data on lettuce are not sufficient to support the residue data extrapolation to the whole group of <b>spinach</b> and <b>similar</b> leaves. Alternatively, the EMS proposed to extrapolate four outdoor residue trials data on open leaf lettuce to spinach and beet leaves only. Although this extrapolation is not explicitly mentioned in the European guidance document, EFSA is of the opinion that the proposal is acceptable, considering the morphological similarities between spinach/beet leaves and open leave varieties of lettuce and taking into account that spinach and beet leaves are minor crops. Thus, a MRL proposal of 0. 15 mg/kg is derived. Based on the risk assessment results EFSA concludes that the intended use of thiacloprid on spinach and beet leaves will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values and therefore is unlikely to pose a public health concern...|$|R

The high accumulations of Zn and Cu that were found in the roots of both water spinach and okra was possibly due to the translocation these metal ions from soil into the roots because Zn and Cu are required micronutrients that are routinely taken by plants for life processes (Hopkins 1999; Mengel et al. 2001).|$|R

30|$|Additions of N to {{the soil}} {{increased}} N concentration in plant shoot (Table  4). Although {{at all levels of}} the applied N, the effect of MWC on shoot N concentrations was not significant (Table  4), enhancement in MWC additions increased N uptake by tomato plant from 140 to 246  mg per pot (nutrients uptake data have not been shown but can be calculated using nutrients concentration and plant dry weight). This can probably be attributed to low C:N ratio of MWC. Applied MWC had a suitable C:N ratio (15 : 1) (Table  2) which could lead to the net mineralization of N in soil. Maftoun et al. (2004) reported that consumption of MWC and poultry manure with low C:N ratios (12.8 and 7.6, respectively) significantly increased the concentration of N in <b>spinach</b> plants. <b>Similar</b> results were also reported by Lehrsch and Kincaid (2007) in field-grown corn. In contrast to the stated achievements, Giannakis et al. (2014) found an inhibition of plant growth with increasing dose of municipal solid waste compost in greenhouse-grown lettuce and tomato. Growth inhibition was associated with a sharp decrease in soil NO 3 –N content. Their findings provided evidences that N immobilization and/or decreased N mineralization were responsible for inhibited growth by constraining N availability.|$|R

Antisera prepared against holoenzyme, LS, and SS were purified by antigen-affinity column chromatography. Purified anti-holoenzyme immunoglobulin G (IgG) and anti-LS IgG cross-reacted with holoenzyme and LS but not with SS. Anti-SS IgG reacted neither with holoenzyme nor with LS.

40|$|The oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) of photosystem II (PS II) {{consists}} {{of at least}} three extrinsic membrane-associated protein subunits, OE 33, OE 23, and OE 17, with associated Mn 2 +, Ca 2 +, and Cl- ions. These subunits are bound to the lumen side of PS II core proteins embedded in the thylakoid membrane. Our experiments reveal that a significant fraction of each subunit is normally present in unassembled pools within the thylakoid lumen. This conclusion was supported by immunological detection of free subunits after freshly isolated pea thylakoids were fractionated with low levels of Triton X- 100. Plastocyanin, a soluble lumen protein, was completely released from the lumen by 0. 04 % Triton X- 100. This gentle detergent treatment also caused the release from the thylakoids of between 10 and 20 %, 40 and 60 %, and 15 and 50 % of OE 33, OE 23, and OE 17, respectively. Measurements of the rates of oxygen evolution from Triton-treated thylakoids, both in the presence and absence of Ca 2 +, and before and after incubation with hydroquinone, demonstrated that the OEC was not dissociated by the detergent treatment. Thylakoids isolated from <b>spinach</b> released <b>similar</b> amounts of extrinsic proteins after Triton treatment. These data demonstrate that physiologically active chloroplasts contain significant pools of unassembled extrinsic OEC polypeptide subunits free in the lumen of the thylakoids...|$|R
40|$|Room {{temperature}} chlorophyll a fluorescence {{was used}} {{to determine the effects of}} developmental history, developmental stage, and leaf age on susceptibility of spinach to in vivo low temperature (5 °C) induced photoinhibition. Spinach (Spinacia oleracea cv Savoy) leaves expanded at cold hardening temperatures (5 °C day/night), an irradiance of 250 micromoles per square meter per second of photosynthetic proton flux density, and a photoperiod of 16 hours were less sensitive than leaves expanded at nonhardening temperatures (16 or 25 °C day/night) and the same irradiance and photoperiod. This differential sensitivity to low-temperature photoinhibition was observed at high (1200) but not lower (500 or 800 micromoles per square meter per second) irradiance treatment. In spite of a differential sensitivity to photoinhibition, both cold-hardened and nonhardened <b>spinach</b> exhibited <b>similar</b> recovery kinetics at either 20 or 5 °C. Shifting plants grown at 16 °C (day/night) to 5 °C (day/night) for 12 days after full leaf expansion did not alter the sensitivity to photoinhibition at 5 °C. Conversely, shifting plants grown at 5 °C (day/night) to 16 °C (day/night) for 12 days produced a sensitivity to photoinhibition at 5 °C similar to control plants grown at 16 °C. Thus, any resistance to low-temperature photoinhibition acquired during growth at 5 °C was lost in 12 days at 16 °C. We conclude that leaf developmental history, developmental stage, and leaf age contribute significantly to the in vivo photoinhibitory response of spinach. Thus, these characteristics must be defined clearly in studies of plant susceptibility to photoinhibition...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn plants Ca 2 + plays {{a crucial}} role as second messenger. Thus calmodulin {{is one of the most}} {{important}} signal transducing molecules for metabolic regulation in plants. Previously we showed that bovine testis calmodulin can be covalently coupled at one site to ubiquitin in a Ca 2 +-dependent manner in the presence of ATP/Mg 2 + by ubiquityl-calmodulin synthetase. Since calmodulin from spinach has 13 amino acid sequence differences to bovine calmodulin - two of them in Ca 2 +-binding loops - it was unclear, whether a conjugation of ubiquitin to this molecule would be possible. In this paper it is shown that calmodulin from <b>spinach</b> and a <b>similar</b> calmodulin from the mold Neurospora crassa can be covalently conjugated to ubiquitin in a Ca 2 +-dependent manner. It is shown that higher molecular mass conjugates containing up to three ubiquitin molecules per calmodulin are obtained. Experiments with methylated ubiquitin demonstrate that, as with vertebrate calmodulins, only one lysine residue is linked to ubiquitin and that the incorporation of addditional ubiquitin molecules leads to a polyubiquitin chain...|$|R

Heavy metal pollution is an increasing phenomenon and contamination of these heavy metals has {{detrimental effects on the}} environment and humans. The concentrations of metals in the soil, leaves, stem bark and flowers of Moringa ovalifolia sampled from Okahandja, Okaukuejo, Halali and Tsumeb in Namibia were investigated. Acid digestion of all samples was performed utilising the microwave technique. Determination of elements from the extracts were analysed by inductively coupled plasma - optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). No lethal amounts of heavy metals were found in the soil, leaves, stem bark and flowers of Moringa ovalifolia. The results from Moringa ovalifolia was compared to <b>spinach</b> from another <b>similar</b> study. On average, Moringa leaves contained more or less similar amounts of Zn (29. 4 mg kg- 1) and Cr (13. 2 mg kg- 1) but higher higher amounts of Fe (263. 8 mg kg- 1) concentrations than spinach, with values of Zn (30. 0 mg kg- 1), Cr (20. 0 mg kg- 1) and Fe (190 mg kg- 1) from a previous study. In this study, selected statistical methods such as correlation analysis and principal component analysis were used to identify the origin of these metals in the soil, leaves and stem bark collected from the Moringa farm, national parks and the road side in Namibia.

40|$|Spinach {{has become}} an {{important}} vegetable crop in most {{regions of the world}} and remarkable changes in production amounts have occurred in the past decades due to demand increase in many countries. Fifty-four spinach landraces collected from diverse geographical regions of Iran were evaluated for several qualitative and quantitative traits. Landraces indicated a high variability for measured morphologic characteristics regarding results of variance analysis and descriptive statistics. The first three factors of factors analysis explained 76. 8 % of variation of spinach landraces. The first extracted factor can be regarded as a leaf property vector; the extracted second factor could be named as yield vector and the third factor was female plants percent vector. The dendrogram of cluster analysis generated from genotypes distance matrices showed that in a distance linkage of 800, the 54 spinach landraces could be agglomerated into sixteen clusters. The number of clusters was verified by multivariate analysis of variance test through Wilks' Lambda statistics. Some spinach landraces such as G 10 G 13, G 38 and G 41 were individual cluster and were not similar to the other collected genotypes while some of the <b>spinach</b> landraces were <b>similar</b> to each other and grouped as one cluster such as cluster 9 (C 9). The cluster C 14 (landrace Karaj 2) was the most favorable genotype due to good performance for most measured quantitative traits.

40|$|Spinach (Spinacia oleracea) leaves {{formed an}} active sink for {{atmospheric}} H 2 S. Upon short-term exposure, H 2 S flux to the leaves showed saturation kinetics {{with respect to}} the H 2 S concentrations and could be described by the Michaelis-Menten equation. The kinetics of H 2 S flux to <b>spinach</b> leaves were <b>similar</b> for plants grown in a nutrient solution and in soil, and plants exposed in light and in darkness. The apparent J(H 2 S) max was about 1. 7 pmol cm- 2 s- 1 and K[H 2 S] (concentration at which 1 / 2 J(H 2 S) max was reached) ranged from 5 to 11 pmol cm- 3 H 2 S (0. 12 to 0. 26 -mu- 11 (- 1) H 2 S). The H 2 S flux to spinach leaves depended on the exposure temperature, with low fluxes at low and high fluxes at high temperatures. The apparent J(H 2 S) max increased from 0. 4 pmol cm- 2 s- 1 at 1 -degrees-C to 2. 4 pmol cm- 2 s- 1 at 32. 5 -degrees-C. H 2 S exposure did not affect diffusive conductance of leaves to aqueous vapor efflux at the various conditions. At exposure temperatures of 12 -degrees-C and higher and at low atmospheric H 2 S concentrations (4 pmol cm- 3 and lower), H 2 S deposition velocities were close to that of diffusive conductance of leaves to aqueous vapor efflux, illustrating a very low internal resistance of the leaves to H 2 S. The internal resistance to H 2 S increased with increasing atmospheric H 2 S concentrations. At exposure temperatures of 8 -degrees-C and lower, the internal resistance to H 2 S was high, even at low H 2 S concentrations. It is proposed that the internal resistance of plant leaves to H 2 S is determined by the rate of metabolism of the deposited H 2 S...|$|R
40|$|Plant water {{channels}} {{are members of}} the very old Major Intrinsic Protein (MIP) family, with representatives in bacteria, fungi, animals, and plants. The genome of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana contains 35 MIP genes. Based on protein sequence comparisons, the MIP family has been divided in four subfamilies: the PIP (Plasma membrane Intrinsic Protein), the TIP (Tonoplast Intrinsic Protein), the NIP (NOD 26 -like Intrinsic Protein), and the SIP (Small basic Intrinsic Protein) subfamilies. In order to harmonise the names of MIP members in all plant species, a nomenclature has been proposed, which is now broadly accepted. The increasing number of sequences from various plant species, including non-vascular plants, angiosperms, and conifers, provides information concerning the evolution of the MIP family in plants. In particular, the highly conserved PIP subfamily is divided into two groups, PIP 1 and PIP 2. The relatively large number of PIPs (13 in Arabidopsis) and the high degree of conservation within this subfamily point to important roles for these proteins in plants and to the existence of a high selective pressure on genes of both the PIP 1 and the PIP 2 groups in evolution. The recently solved structures of a mammal aquaporin, AQP 1, and a bacterial glycerol facilitator, GlpF indicate that the overall fold of all members of the MIP family is likely to be conserved. However, a comparison of the sequences of these proteins and that of plant MIPs from different subfamilies indicates that members of the different MIP subfamilies probably exhibit different substrate specificities. Interestingly, PIP 1 and PIP 2 proteins purified from spinach show clear structural differences, implying that members of the two different groups in the PIP subfamily have different transport properties. MIP genes {{have been shown to be}} regulated at the transcriptional level by abiotic and biotic factors. Microarrays have been designed in order to investigate the expression of all Arabidopsis MIP genes. Data from a study of the organ specificity of MIP genes are presented. Results of reverse genetics studies suggest that the major substrate of PIPs is water. Immunolabelling studies of two PIP 1 isoforms in <b>spinach,</b> together with <b>similar</b> studies in other species, indicate that PIP 1 homologues are involved in phloem transport and guard cell movements.

40|$|Phenolic {{compounds}} in African green leafy vegetables (GLVs) {{may have a}} significant impact on human health. However, there is little information on the phenolic composition, antioxidant properties, as well as biological and cellular protective effects of these vegetables. The effects of boiling and extraction solvent on these compounds and on their antioxidant properties are also unknown. Phenolic content, antioxidant activity and cellular protective effects of four African GLVs in comparison with spinach, an exotic GLV, was determined. African GLVs had appreciable levels of total phenolics and antioxidant activity and in higher quantities compared to spinach. Boiling decreased the antioxidant content and activity of these vegetables and 75 % acetone was more effective in extracting antioxidants from the GLVs compared to water. GLVs with high levels of phenolics also contained higher levels of antioxidant activity, suggesting that phenolics are likely to have contributed to radical scavenging activity of these vegetable extracts, even though the degree of scavenging varied in each extract of the vegetable species. The flavonoid compositions of raw and boiled African GLVs and spinach were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. Epicatechin and rutin were the most dominant flavonoids found in both water and 75 % acetone extracts. Among water extracts, pumpkin contained higher concentrations of detected flavonoids, while among the acetone extracts, cowpea exhibited higher concentrations. The effect of boiling was dependent on the type of vegetable and the specific flavonoids. There were no major differences observed between the type of flavonoids detected in extracts of African GLVs and those in <b>spinach.</b> However, <b>similar</b> to the results of total phenolics and antioxidant activity, the 75 % acetone extracts of African GLVs also exhibited higher amounts of flavonoids than spinach. The protective effects of GLVs against oxidative haemolysis were dependent on the type of vegetable species. Boiling had variable effects depending on the species. The highest level of protection of erythrocytes against oxidative damage was offered by amaranth extracts, while extracts of raw jute mallow contributed to the damage of erythrocytes. The highest antioxidant protection activity against oxidative damage in plasmid DNA was offered by extracts of jute mallow and lowest by spinach. <p. For the cell viability assays, GLVs were evaluated to determine their cytotoxicity levels and functional role in oxidative damage. The results of the long-term cell viability (i. e. MTT, NR and CV) assays indicated no cytotoxicity, while the short-term cell viability (i. e. DCF) assay indicated that all extracts of raw GLVs were significantly (p < 0. 05) cytotoxic to SC- 1 fibroblast and human adenocarcinoma colon cancer (Caco- 2) cells than extracts of cooked samples, and the levels of toxicity in the extracts of spinach was higher than in African GLVs. These results indicate that there was an initial cytotoxic effect as extracts of raw GLVs were added to the cells. However, after about 72 h, the cells recovered from the initial shock and started proliferating as usual. In the presence of peroxyl radicals, extracts of African GLVs exhibited higher protective effects against oxidative damage in both types of cell cultures than extracts of spinach. These results indicate that these protective effects could be attributed to the presence of phenolics and antioxidant properties of these extracts. Although boiling reduced the antioxidant content and activity of African GLVs, the levels remained higher than in spinach. Boiling also decreased the cytotoxicity and cell damage caused by extracts of raw GLVs samples. African GLVs are consumed after boiling, and therefore the observed cytotoxicities might not be experienced in practical terms. African GLVs have therefore a potential to reduce the risk and development of diseases associated with oxidative stress in communities that consume these vegetables.

However, {{little is known about the}} relationship between the δ 15 N of the N source and the 14 N/ 15 N fractionation in plants under ammonium (NH 4 +) nutrition. When NH 4 + is the major N source, the two forms, NH 4 + and NH 3, are present in the nutrient solution. There is a 1. 025 thermodynamic isotope effect between NH 3 (g) and NH 4 + (aq) which drives to a different δ 15 N. Nine plant species with different NH 4 + -sensitivities were cultured hydroponically with NO 3 - or NH 4 + as the sole N sources, and plant growth and δ 15 N were determined. Short-term NH 4 + /NH 3 uptake experiments at pH 6. 0 and 9. 0 (which favours NH 3 form) were carried out in order to support and substantiate our hypothesis. N source fractionation throughout the whole plant was interpreted on the basis of the relative transport of NH 4 + and NH 3. Results Several NO 3 - -fed plants were consistently enriched in 15 N, whereas plants under NH 4 + nutrition were depleted of 15 N. It was shown that more sensitive plants to NH 4 + toxicity were the most depleted in 15 N. In parallel, N-deficient pea and spinach plants fed with 15 NH 4 + showed an increased level of NH 3 uptake at alkaline pH that was related to the 15 N depletion of the plant.

Conclusions This article proposes that the negative values of δ 15 N in NH 4 + -fed plants are originated from NH 3 uptake by plants. Moreover, this depletion of the heavier N isotope is proportional to the NH 4 + /NH 3 toxicity in plants species. Therefore, we hypothesise that the low affinity transport system for NH 4 + may have two components: one that transports N in the molecular form and is associated with fractionation and another that transports N in the ionic form and is not associated with fractionation. </p...|$|R

Therefore, we hypothesise that the low affinity transport system for NH 4 + may have two components: one that transports N in the molecular form and is associated with fractionation and another that transports N in the ionic form and is not associated with fractionatio...|$|R
40|$|Background: In plants, nitrate (NO 3 -) {{nutrition}} {{gives rise}} to a natural N isotopic signature (δ 15 N), which correlates with the δ 15 N of the N source. However, {{little is known about the}} relationship between the δ 15 N of the N source and the 14 N/ 15 N fractionation in plants under ammonium (NH 4 +) nutrition. When NH 4 + is the major N source, the two forms, NH 4 + and NH 3, are present in the nutrient solution. There is a 1. 025 thermodynamic isotope effect between NH 3 (g) and NH 4 + (aq) which drives to a different δ 15 N. Nine plant species with different NH 4 +-sensitivities were cultured hydroponically with NO 3 - or NH 4 + as the sole N sources, and plant growth and δ 15 N were determined. Short-term NH 4 +/NH 3 uptake experiments at pH 6. 0 and 9. 0 (which favours NH 3 form) were carried out in order to support and substantiate our hypothesis. N source fractionation throughout the whole plant was interpreted on the basis of the relative transport of NH 4 + and NH 3. Results: Several NO 3 [...] fed plants were consistently enriched in 15 N, whereas plants under NH 4 + nutrition were depleted of 15 N. It was shown that more sensitive plants to NH 4 + toxicity were the most depleted in 15 N. In parallel, N-deficient pea and spinach plants fed with 15 NH 4 + showed an increased level of NH 3 uptake at alkaline pH that was related to the 15 N depletion of the plant. Tolerant to NH 4 + pea plants or sensitive <b>spinach</b> plants showed <b>similar</b> trend on 15 N depletion while slight differences in the time kinetics were observed during the initial stages. The use of RbNO 3 as control discarded that the differences observed arise from pH detrimental effects. Conclusions: This article proposes that the negative values of δ 15 N in NH 4 +-fed plants are originated from NH 3 uptake by plants. Moreover, this depletion of the heavier N isotope is proportional to the NH 4 +/NH 3 toxicity in plants species. Therefore, we hypothesise that the low affinity transport system for NH 4 + may have two components: one that transports N in the molecular form and is associated with fractionation and another that transports N in the ionic form and is not associated with fractionation.
