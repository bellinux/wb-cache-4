It deals with general factors {{of increase in}} public expenditures, important growth theories and their efficiency. This thesis explains the formation and {{the character of the}} public administration, reasons for its decentralisation. It shows the position of the regional structure in the public administration system and it handles with the basic ideas of the regional policy. The second part presents the public administration and the <b>stucture</b> of public expenditures in the Czech Republic. The analysis of expenditures of the state budget in the Czech Republic during the period 1995 [...] 2007 follows. It observes their <b>stucture,</b> development and the most important growth factors where the influence of growth in GDP and the inflation excels. The main chapter deals with the analysis of regional expenditures during last years. It uses the regional contribution to GDP and the number of the population for the comparison of expenditures of the particular regions and demonstration of their minor disproportions. In the sphere of managing of regional expenditures it denominates recognized deficiencies and suggests some solutions to problemes such as the breatch of plans, non-transparent subsidies, unnoticed documentation, missing penal system, slow implementation of modern budgeting methods...|$|E

40|$|In Petroleum {{exploration}} it {{is often}} {{important to understand the}} flow of liquids through porous media, which can be described by conservation of fluid, and the assumption (Darcy' Law) that the fluid flux is given by arP where P is the pressure and a is the permeability of the porous media. Three major problems are associated with solving this problem in the situation of interest. First, the permeability a can range over many orders of magnitude (10 orders being typical). Second, the distribution of the permeability can form complicated geometric <b>stuctures</b> associated with geological <b>stuctures</b> such as faults and permeable layers with different flow characteristics. Finally, the permeability data and description of the problem can come in arbitrary sizes depending on the experimental data which is available.
