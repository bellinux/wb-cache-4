During the rising and the declining phases, the mode frequencies are strongly correlated with the activity proxies whereas during the low- and high-activity periods, the frequencies have significantly lower correlation with all the activity proxies considered here.

40|$|We apply a new {{approach}} based on three relativistic groups (bradyon, tachyon and instanton) forming the `Lorentz groupoid' which allows, in particular, to consider tachyons without introducing imaginary masses and negative energies (related, as known, to violation of causality and unitarity). This leads to effectively scalar conglomerate composed of tachyonic neutrino and antineutrino spinor wave functions as a viable model for stationary dark matter. We also briefly discuss a relevant early non-stationary high-energy stage of the universe evolution.

40|$|Non-linear maps can possess various {{dynamical}} behaviors varying {{from stable}} steady states and cycles to chaotic oscillations. Most models assume that individuals {{within a given}} population are identical ignoring the fundamental role of variation. Here we develop a theory of inhomogeneous maps and apply the general approach to modeling heterogeneous populations with discrete evolutionary time step. We show that {{the behavior of the}} inhomogeneous maps may possess complex transition regimes, which depends both on the mean and the variance of the initial parameter distribution. The examples of inhomogeneous models are discussed.

40|$|An Ising antiferromagnet on a stacked {{triangular}} lattice in zero {{field is}} studied by Monte Carlo simulations, {{focusing on the}} character of the low-temperature phase and the effect of the relative strength of the exchange interaction in the stacking direction α. Our results support the presence of the 3 D Wannier phase, with the sublattice magnetization structure (m, -m, 0) and power-law decaying m with the lattice size. The extent of this low-temperature phase shrinks with decreasing α, however, it appears even at very low values if it is accessed from higher temperatures by sufficiently slow cooling.

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the effective-field theory with correlations we investigate effects of an external magnetic field and random site dilution on basic thermodynamic quantities, such as the magnetization and the magnetic susceptibility, of the geometrically frustrated triangular lattice Ising antiferromagnet. Behavior of these quantities is presented in the temperaturefield parameter space for selected mild degrees of dilution. It is found that, besides the anomalies associated with phase transitions from the ferrimagnetic to the paramagnetic state, in some regions of the parameter space these functions display some more anomalies and peculiarities, as a result of joint effects of the geometrical frustration, magnetic dilution, thermal fluctuations and the applied magnetic field.

40|$|We {{consider}} a high-frequency response of electrons {{in a single}} miniband of superlattice subject to dc and ac electric fields. Action of ac electric field causes oscillations of electron's effective mass in miniband, which result in a parametric resonance. We have established a theoretical feasibility of phase-sensitive parametric amplification at the resonance. The parametric amplification does not require operation in conditions of negative differential conductance. Therefore a formation of destructive domains of high electric field inside the superlattice can be prevented. Here we concentrate on the parametric up- and down-conversion of electromagnetic radiation from available frequencies to desirable THz frequency range.
