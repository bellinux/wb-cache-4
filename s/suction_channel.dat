30|$|Introduction Bronchoscopy can be {{particularly}} challenging in patients with acute respiratory distress (ARDS) who required lung-protective ventilation strategies. In a previous study, we showed that a bronchoscope with an external diameter of 4  mm (or less) would allow safer bronchoscopic interventions. Diameter reduction cannot be {{at the expense of}} the <b>suction</b> <b>channel</b> which needs to be sufficient to easily removed thick secretion. From the single-use bronchoscope technology, we proposed an innovation of flexible bronchoscope with a variable outer diameter as follows: a proximal 4  mm diameter for the part inserted in the endotracheal tube, distal head camera with classical diameter (5.3  mm), and 2  mm diameter for the <b>suction</b> <b>channel.</b> The aim of our study was to demonstrate that our prototype of flexible bronchoscope: (1) does not disrupt the protective ventilation, while it is in place in the endotracheal tube (ETT); and (2) enables an efficient suctioning capacity.|$|E

40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at www. springerlink. comLarge (111 +/- 3. 0 pS) K+ channels were recorded in membrane patches from adult rat ventricular myocytes using patch-clamp techniques. The channels were not blocked by 4 -AP (5 mM), intracellular TEA (5 mM) or glybenclamide (100 mM). Applying stretch to the membrane (as pipette <b>suction)</b> increased <b>channel</b> open probability (Po) in both cell-attached and isolated patches (typically, Po approximately equals 0. 005 with no pressure; approximately equals 0. 328 with 90 cm H 2 O: Vm = 40 mV, pHi = 7. 2). The channels were activated by a decrease in intracellular pH; decreasing pHi to 5. 5 from 7. 2 increased Po to 0. 16 from approx. 0. 005 (no suction, Vm held at 40 mV). These properties {{are consistent with those}} demonstrated for TREK- 1, a member of the recently cloned tandem pore family. We confirmed, using RT-PCR, that TREK- 1 is expressed in rat ventricle, suggesting that the channel being recorded is indeed TREK- 1. However, we show also that the channels are activated by millimolar concentrations of intracellular ATP. At a pH of 6 with no ATP at the intracellular membrane face, Po was 0. 048 +/- 0. 023, whereas Po increased to 0. 22 +/- 0. 1 with 1 mM ATP, and to 0. 348 +/- 0. 13 with 3 mM (n = 5; no membrane stretch applied).

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the magnetohydrodynamic flow and heat transfer in a viscous incompressible fluid between two parallel porous plates experiencing a discontinuous change in wall temperature. An explicit finite difference scheme has been employed {{to solve the}} coupled non-linear equations governing the flow. The flow phenomenon has been characterized by Hartmann number, <b>suction</b> Reynolds number, <b>channel</b> Reynolds number and Prandtl number. The effects of these parameters on the velocity and temperature distribution have been analyzed {{and the results are}} presented with the aid of figures. It is observed that a growing suction parameter R retards the velocity of the flow field both in MHD as well as non-MHD flow. The effect of increasing Hartmann number is to decrease the transverse component of velocity for both suction and injection and in absence of suction and injection, while it decreases the axial component of velocity up {{to the middle of the}} channel and beyond this the effect reverses. There is a sharp fluctuation in temperature near the walls and at the middle of the channel which may be attributed to the discontinuous change in wall temperature.

40|$|TREK- 1, a mechanosensitive K channel {{from the}} two-pore family (K 2 P), is {{involved}} in protective regulation of the resting potential in CNS neurons and other tissues. The structure of TREK- 1 and {{the basis of its}} sensitivity to stretch and variety of lipid-soluble factors remain unknown. Using existing K channel structures as modeling templates, TREK- 1 was envisioned as a two-fold symmetrical complex with the gate formed primarily by the centrally positioned TM 2 b helices of the second homologous repeat. Opening was modeled as a conical expansion of the barrel separating TM 2 b's accompanied by extension of TM 2 a helices with the cytoplasmic TM 2 a-TM 1 b connector. Seeking first experimental support to the models we have accomplished thermodynamic analysis of mouse TREK- 1 gating and functional testing of several deletion mutants. The predicted increase of the channel in-plane area (ΔA) of ∼ 5 nm 2 in models was supported by the experimental ΔA of ∼ 4 nm 2 derived from the slope of open probability versus membrane tension in HEK- 293 T cells and their cytoskeleton-depleted blebs. In response to steps of <b>suction,</b> wild-type <b>channel</b> produced transient currents in cell-attached patches and mostly sustained currents upon patch excision. TREK- 1 motifs not present in canonical K channels include divergent cytoplasmic N- and C-termini, and a characteristic 50 -residue extracellular loop in the first homologous repeat. Deletion of the extracellular loop (Δ 76 – 124) reduced the average current density in patches, increased spontaneous activity and generated a larger sub-population of high-conductance channels, while activation by tension augmented by arachidonic acid was fully retained. Further deletion of the C-terminal end (Δ 76 – 124 /Δ 334 – 411) removed voltage dependency but otherwise produced no additional effect. In an attempt to generate a cysteine-free version of the channel, we mutated two remaining cysteines 159 and 219 in the transmembrane region. C 219 A did not compromise channel activity, whereas the C 159 A/S mutants were essentially inactive.

40|$|Hormone-stimulated {{pancreatic}} function tests (PFTs) {{are considered}} {{the gold standard for}} measuring pancreatic exocrine function. PFTs involve the administration of intravenous secretin or cholecystokinin, followed by collection and analysis of pancreatic secretions. Because exocrine function may decline in the earliest phase of pancreatic fibrosis, PFTs are considered accurate for diagnosing chronic pancreatitis. Unfortunately, these potentially valuable tests are infrequently performed except at specialized centers, because they are time consuming and complicated. To overcome these limitations, endoscopic PFT methods have been developed which include aspiration of pancreatic secretions through the <b>suction</b> <b>channel</b> of the endoscope. The secretin endoscopic pancreatic function test (ePFT) involves collection of duodenal aspirates at 15, 30, 45 and 60 min after secretin stimulation. A bicarbonate concentration greater than 80 mmol/L in any of the samples is considered a normal result. The secretin ePFT has demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity compared with various reference standards, including the &#x 201 C;Dreiling tube&#x 201 D; secretin PFT, endoscopic ultrasound, and surgical histology. Furthermore, a standard autoanalyzer can be used for bicarbonate analysis, which allows the secretin ePFT to be performed at any hospital.

This paper will review the literature validating the use of ePFT in the diagnosis of exocrine insufficiency and chronic pancreatitis.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{use of a}} {{flexible}} or rigid fiberoptic bronchoscope belongs to the standard repertoire in anesthesiology. Besides a lack of training these procedures may be considerably compromised by endoscopic lens fogging. Several antifogging approaches are commercially available but to date no controlled studies regarding the efficacy of these devices in bronchoscopes exists. The aim {{of the present study}} was to compare the efficacy of different commercially available anti-fogging techniques for rigid and flexible bronchoscopes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was performed at the department of anesthesia in a university children's hospital. An artificial airway model was created to simulate in vivo conditions with respect to airflow, temperature and atmospheric moisture. A test picture was inserted into the artificial airway for assuring a standardized view through the bronchoscopes. Antifogging efficacy of two liquid antifog solutions (Ultrastop and Anti-Fog), two antifog wipes (Lina Clear and Reso Clear) and an induction endoscope preheater system (used after one and two induction preheating phases) was assessed by video taping of the bronchoscope view of the test picture. In addition the administration of continuous oxygen airflow of 2 l min⁻¹ through the <b>suction</b> <b>channel</b> of the flexible bronchoscope was tested as an alternative method to prevent lens fogging. All final pictures were rated by 10 staff anesthesiologists who were blinded to the antifog devices used. To assess the clinical relevance of the results, ratings were classified into a 5 grade rating scale (ranging from no visualization of any structure to excellent endoscopic view allowing safe endotracheal intubation). In addition, the failure rate of each anti-fog technique was calculated. RESULTS: A total of 300 endoscopic test pictures were taken and assessed. Using the flexible bronchoscope, the use of anti-fog solution (failure rate 3...|$|E

Cricothyroid {{membrane}} injections and the applica-tion of {{a coarse}} fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB) below the vocal cords for topical anesthesia {{have a number}} of limitations for certain patients. Thus, the aim of the present observational study was to assess the effect of a novel modified topical anesthesia method using the effective sedation drugs, remifentanil (Rem) or dexmedetomidine (Dex), during awake fiberoptic orotra-cheal intubation (AFOI). In total, 90 adult patients, who had been classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists I‑II, were included in the study. The patients had anticipated difficult airways and were to undergo orotracheal intubation for elec-tive surgery. The patients were enrolled in the double‑blinded randomized pilot study and received Rem or Dex for sedation during the modified AFOI procedure. The two groups received 2 % lidocaine for topical anesthesia via an epidural catheter, which was threaded through the <b>suction</b> <b>channel</b> of the FOB. The main clinical outcomes were evaluated by graded scores representing the conditions for intubation and post‑intubation. Additional parameters analyzed included airway obstruction, hemodynamic changes, time required for intubation, amnesia level and subjective satisfaction. All 90 patients were success-fully intubated using the modified AFOI technique. The comfort scores and airway events during intubation did not significantly differ between the two groups. However, the Rem group experienced less coughing, and less time was required for tracheal intubation when compared with the Dex group. No statistically significant differences were observed in the changes to the mean arterial pressure and heart rate at any time point between the two groups. Therefore, the current study demonstrated that the modified AFOI method is feasible and effective for difficult airway management, and that Dex and Rem exhibit similar efficacy as adjuvant therapies...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aim: Contamination of {{endoscopy}} suites with bacteria during procedures is {{of concern}} particularly through droplets during handling of biopsy specimens. It has been advocated that suctioning while removing the biopsy forceps could help to reduce potentially hazardous bioaerosols. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the efficacy of air suctioning during removal of the biopsy forceps. Materials and Methods: Airborne bacteria were collected by an impactor air-sampler (MAS- 100). Fifty liters of air were collected continuously for 30 seconds at a 30 cm distance from the colonoscope <b>suction</b> <b>channel.</b> Room air samples were taken in the endoscopy suite in the morning prior to the beginning of the endoscopy program, during colonoscopy with a sham biopsy in the descending colon with and without suctioning and at the end of the procedure day. Standard 90 mm Petri dishes containing a selective medium for gram-positive cocci (CNA blood agar) were used with the impaction sampler and colony forming units/m 3 (cfu) were determined. Results: Measurements were performed at fifty consecutive colonoscopies. Prior to the beginning of the endoscopy program, the bioaerosol burden in the colonoscopy suite reached a mean of 4. 2 cfu/m 3. During colonoscopies performed without suctioning at biopsy the bioaerosol burden increased to 29. 4 cfu/m 3 whereas this burden increased only to 15. 1 cfu/m 3 when the suctioning was applied during removal of the biopsy forceps. The difference in bioaerosol burden between suctioning and no suctioning was highly significant (p < 0. 0005). At the end of the procedure day the airborne bacteria count dropped to 15. 6 cfu/m 3. The analysis of the colonies on the CNA blood agar identified predominantly enterococci. Staphylococci spp. and other gram-positive bacteria were rarely isolated. Conclusion: The present study indicates that the bioaerosol burden during handling of biopsy specimens is not neglectable but can be reduced by the simple habit of applying suctioning during acquisition of biopsies. This practice might be an important infection-control measure during gastrointestinal endoscopies...|$|E

Durante ventilación mecánica (VM) la fibrobroncoscopía (FB) se limita a tubos endotraqueales (TET) > 4, 5 mm de diámetro ya que el fibrobroncoscopio con canal de succión más pequeño es de 3, 5 mm. Nuestro objetivo fue evaluar la utilidad de la ML para FB en niños sometidos a VM con TET Laryngeal mask (LM) {{has been used}} to manage airways during general anesthesia, in both {{children}} and adults, to avoid tracheal intubation. Lately its use has been extended to perform flexible bronchoscopy (FB). In an infant under mechanical ventilation (MV), most of FB require an endotracheal tube # 4. 5 because the smallest instrument with a <b>suction</b> <b>channel</b> has a 3. 5 mm diameter. Our objective was to evaluate the use of LM while performing FB in patients on MV. Patients were sedated (atropine- midazolam and vecuronium), and monitored with transcutaneous oxygen saturation and cardiorespiratory monitor in an Intensive Care Unit setup. LM was introduced, and its position was verified by clinical auscultation. FB Olympus BF C- 30, with 3. 5 mm diameter was used. From December 1997 to October 1998 eleven procedures were done in 6 patients. Their mean age was 6. 2 months (range: 0. 5 - 33), weight 4. 9 kg (2. 7 - 10. 5). MV parameters were FiO 2 0. 45 (0. 4 - 1), MIP 28. 4 cm H 2 O (20 - 60) and PEEP 5, 18 cm H 2 O (3 - 8). In all patients we used LM # 1. 0, with an internal diameter 5. 25 mm. Indications for FB were: atelectasis (6), tracheobronchomalacia (2), hemoptisis (2) and subglotic stenosis (1). LM was introduced during the first attempt in 9 procedures, without complications. We maintained positive pressure ventilation without displacements of LM. After the FB, the patients were reintubated, with similar parameters compared to prior procedure. To sum up, we found that LM provides a safe artificial airway to ventilate patients who need FB during mechanical ventilation on small endotracheal tubes. This technique allows bronchial visualization, and aspiration and to perform bronchoalveolar lavage to carry out cell counting and culture...|$|E
