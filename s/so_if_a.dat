5|$|The child's sex can be {{influenced}} by factors that affect temperature, including the weather, the wind direction, diet, and the father's age. Features other than sex also depend on whether the semen overpowers the menses, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> man has strong semen, he will have sons who resemble him, while if the semen is weak, he will have daughters who resemble their mother.|$|E
5|$|Archaea {{reproduce}} asexually by binary {{or multiple}} fission, fragmentation, or budding; meiosis does not occur, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> species of archaea exists {{in more than}} one form, all have the same genetic material. Cell division is controlled in a cell cycle; after the cell's chromosome is replicated and the two daughter chromosomes separate, the cell divides. In the genus Sulfolobus, the cycle has characteristics that are similar to both bacterial and eukaryotic systems. The chromosomes replicate from multiple starting-points (origins of replication) using DNA polymerases that resemble the equivalent eukaryotic enzymes.|$|E
5|$|Proteins are {{essential}} to life. Cells produce new protein molecules from amino acid building blocks based on information coded in DNA. Each type of protein is a specialist that usually only performs one function, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> cell needs to do something new, it must make a new protein. Viruses force the cell to make new proteins that the cell does not need, but are needed for the virus to reproduce. Protein synthesis consists of two major steps: transcription and translation.|$|E
30|$|<b>So,</b> <b>if</b> <b>an</b> image's region R has n neighbors, it {{will have}} n {{neighborhood}} functions (see Figure 8 (right)).|$|R
50|$|Many of Atmel's {{microcontrollers}} in {{this line}} have similar instruction sets, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>an</b> engineer learns the instruction set from one of their microprocessors, this knowledge is transferable to other microcontrollers in the line.|$|R
50|$|The gelatin test is used {{to analyze}} whether a microbe can hydrolyze gelatin with the enzyme gelatinase.  The gelatin makes the agar solid, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>an</b> {{organism}} can produce gelatinase and consume gelatin as an energy and carbon source, the agar will become liquid during growth.|$|R
5|$|Roberts' son, Kenny Roberts Jr., won the 2000 500cc World Championship, {{making them}} the only {{father and son}} duo to have won the title. Ironically, Roberts has stated that he {{considers}} himself a dirt tracker at heart and only took up road racing because {{it was necessary to}} do <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> rider was going to compete for the Grand National championship. He also said that he would have preferred to remain in the United States to compete in the Grand National championship if Yamaha or another manufacturer had been able to construct a dirt track racer capable of competing with Harley-Davidson.|$|E
5|$|Being unemployed, {{we spent}} {{almost all of}} each weekday at the school, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> tuition fee had been applicable, Mrs Mac would have earned a tidy sum of money. That, of course, was not her way of doing things. She {{required}} no payment for the training she provided, and I suspect that she was quite out of pocket over the whole affair... It would be true {{to say that a}} great number of the pilots whose futures were finally fulfilled in airlines in Australia owe a deal to Mrs Mac... There was no other school operating in Sydney at the time, providing Morse training to potential airline pilots, and no other school then or thereafter giving such training completely free of charge.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} {{prominent}} {{features on the}} ECG: the P wave (atrial depolarisation), the QRS complex (ventricular depolarisation) and the T wave (ventricular repolarisation). As the heart cells contract, they create a current that travels through the heart. A downward deflection on the ECG implies cells are becoming more positive in charge ("depolarising") {{in the direction of}} that lead, whereas an upward inflection implies cells are becoming more negative ("repolarising") {{in the direction of the}} lead. This depends on the position of the lead, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> wave of depolarising moved from left to right, a lead on the left would show a negative deflection, and a lead on the right would show a positive deflection. The ECG is a useful tool in detecting rhythm disturbances and in detecting insufficient blood supply to the heart. Sometimes abnormalities are suspected, but not immediately visible on the ECG. Testing when exercising can be used to provoke an abnormality, or an ECG can be worn for a longer period such as a 24-hour Holter monitor if a suspected rhythm abnormality is not present at the time of assessment.|$|E
50|$|NTFS-3G {{supports}} partial NTFS journaling, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>an</b> unexpected {{computer failure}} leaves the file system in an inconsistent state, the volume can be repaired. As of 2009, a volume having an unclean journal file is recovered and mounted by default. The ‘norecover’ mount option {{can be used}} to disable this behavior.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} a collective-bargaining session or process, {{parties may}} either reach an {{agreement}} or fail to do <b>so.</b> <b>If</b> <b>an</b> agreement is reached, a collective agreement is concluded. If no agreement is reached, parties may agree on mediation or arbitration, or decide to exert pressure on each other through industrial action.|$|R
50|$|A {{filtered}} and purified Influenza A {{vaccine for}} humans {{is being developed}} and many countries have recommended it be stockpiled <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>an</b> Avian influenza pandemic starts jumping to humans, the vaccine can quickly be administered to avoid loss of life. Avian influenza is sometimes called avian flu, and commonly bird flu.|$|R
25|$|Minnesota's {{fiscal year}} runs from July 1 to June 30, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> {{biennial}} budget isn't {{passed by the}} end of June in an odd-numbered year, the effect is a government shutdown, as happened in 2005 and again in 2011.|$|E
25|$|Mitochondrial genome {{mutations}} {{are passed}} on 100% {{of the time}} from mother to all her offspring. <b>So,</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> female has a mitochondrial trait, all offspring inherit it. However, if a male has a mitochondrial trait, no offspring inherit it.|$|E
25|$|There is an {{intravenous}} preparation available, {{but it is}} irritant to veins, causing phlebitis. Most people {{absorb the}} drug extremely well after taking it orally, <b>so,</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> patient can swallow, {{there is not much}} need to administer it intravenously, even if used to treat endocarditis (infection of the heart chambers).|$|E
50|$|The OSP {{is limited}} to {{implementations}} {{to the extent that}} they conform to those specifications. This allows for conformance to be partial. <b>So</b> <b>if</b> <b>an</b> implementation follows the specification for some aspects, and deviates in other aspects, then the Convent Not to Sue applies only to the implementation's aspects which follow the specification.|$|R
5000|$|The {{classical}} virtual directory {{based on}} proxy cannot modify underlying data structures or create new views {{based on the}} relationships of data from across multiple systems. <b>So</b> <b>if</b> <b>an</b> application requires a different structure, such as a flattened list of identities, or a deeper hierarchy for delegated administration, a virtual directory is limited.|$|R
60|$|The {{painter who}} {{represents}} only the sunny side of nature portrays a one-sided, {{and therefore a}} false view of things, for, as everyone knows, nature is not all sunshine. <b>So,</b> <b>if</b> <b>an</b> author makes his pen-and-ink pictures represent only the amusing and picturesque view of things, he does injustice to his subject.|$|R
25|$|Bivectors and axial vectors {{are related}} by Hodge dual. In a real vector space the Hodge dual relates a {{subspace}} to its orthogonal complement, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> bivector {{is represented by}} a plane then the axial vector associated with it is simply the plane's surface normal. The plane has two normals, one on each side, giving the two possible orientations for the plane and bivector.|$|E
25|$|Some {{aspects of}} the {{physical}} world are so inevitable that it is always reasonable to impute knowledge of their incidence. <b>So</b> <b>if</b> <b>A</b> abandons B on a beach, A must be taken to foresee that the tide comes in and goes out. But the mere fact that B subsequently drowns is not enough. A court would have to consider where the body was left and what level of injury A believed that B had suffered. If B was left in a position that any reasonable person would consider safe but a storm surge caused extensive flooding throughout the area, this might be a novus actus. That B was further injured by an event within a foreseen class does not of itself require a court to hold that every incident falling within that class is a natural link in the chain. Only those causes that are reasonably foreseeable fit naturally into the chain. <b>So</b> <b>if</b> <b>A</b> had heard a weather forecast predicting a storm, the drowning will be a natural outcome. But if this was an event like a flash flood, an entirely unpredictable event, it will be a novus actus.|$|E
25|$|A read, burst terminate, or {{precharge}} command may {{be issued}} {{at any time}} after a read command, and will interrupt the read burst after the configured CAS latency. <b>So</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> read command is issued on cycle 0, another read command is issued on cycle 2, and the CAS latency is 3, then the first read command will begin bursting data out during cycles 3 and 4, then {{the results from the}} second read command will appear beginning with cycle 5.|$|E
50|$|The {{value of}} a Queen is 3 points, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> you capture <b>a</b> queen with another queen, you acquire the double point, that is 6 points.The {{value of a}} King is 4 points, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> you capture <b>a</b> king with another king, you acquire the double point, that is 8 points.Capturing a Jack with a Jack is as scored follows:- The value of a Jack is 12.5, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> you capture <b>a</b> Jack with another Jack, you acquire 25 points.|$|R
5000|$|The Option key {{can also}} provide access to dead key functionality. For example, holding down [...] while {{pressing}} [...] will create a highlighted grave accent which {{will be added to}} the next letter <b>if</b> possible - <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>an</b> [...] is then pressed, the resultant character is è. <b>If</b> <b>an</b> [...] is pressed instead, the two characters are not compatible so the result is `r.|$|R
5000|$|...As a consequence, {{aircraft}} {{with the}} same CL at takeoff under the same atmospheric conditions will have takeoff speeds proportional to [...] <b>So</b> <b>if</b> <b>an</b> aircraft's wing area is increased by 10% and nothing else changed, the takeoff speed will fall by about 5%. Likewise, <b>if</b> <b>an</b> aircraft designed to take off at 150 mph grows in weight during development by 40%, its takeoff speed increases to [...] = 177 mph.|$|R
25|$|The {{most common}} caliper design uses a single {{hydraulically}} actuated piston within a cylinder, although high performance brakes use {{as many as}} twelve. Modern cars use different hydraulic circuits to actuate the brakes on each set of wheels as a safety measure. The hydraulic design also helps multiply braking force. The number of pistons in a caliper {{is often referred to}} as the number of 'pots', <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> vehicle has 'six pot' calipers it means that each caliper houses six pistons.|$|E
25|$|In general, one pin is scored {{for each}} pin that is knocked over. <b>So</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> player bowls over three pins {{with the first}} shot, then six with the second, the player would receive a total of nine pins for that frame. If a player knocks down nine pins with the first shot, but misses with the second, the player would also score nine. When a player fails to knock down all ten pins after their second ball it is known as an open frame.|$|E
25|$|Although a small DOF {{implies that}} {{other parts of}} the image will be unsharp, it does not, by itself, {{determine}} how unsharp those parts will be. The amount of background (or foreground) blur depends on the distance from the plane of focus, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> background is close to the subject, {{it may be difficult to}} blur sufficiently even with a small DOF. In practice, the lens f-number is usually adjusted until the background or foreground is acceptably blurred, often without direct concern for the DOF.|$|E
50|$|Both themes {{have the}} same tonic, but in {{opposite}} modes, <b>so</b> that <b>if</b> <b>A</b> is major, B is minor, and vice versa.|$|R
50|$|Protected memory — memory {{protection}} <b>so</b> that <b>if</b> <b>an</b> application corrupts its memory, {{the memory of}} other applications will not be corrupted.|$|R
50|$|As signed numbers can {{represent}} negative numbers, they lose {{a range of}} positive numbers {{that can only be}} represented with unsigned numbers of the same size (in bits) because half the possible values are non-positive values (<b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>an</b> 8-bit is signed, positive unsigned values 128 to 255 are gone while -128 to 127 are present). Unsigned variables can dedicate all the possible values to the positive number range.|$|R
25|$|A blank-firing adapter or blank-firing {{attachment}} (BFA), {{sometimes called}} a blank adapter or blank attachment, is a device {{used in conjunction}} with blank ammunition. Blank firing adapters are required for allowing blanks to cycle most automatic firearms. It can also be a safety feature designed <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> live round is mistakenly fired, most of the energy is spent smashing through the BFA reducing both the range and damage inflicted. A BFA may also divert the hot gases from a blank discharge out to the sides, reducing the risk of injury to the target of an aimed shot.|$|E
25|$|For instance, {{breast cancer}} cells {{look the same}} whether they {{are found in the}} breast or have spread {{to another part of the}} body. <b>So,</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> tissue sample taken from a tumor in the lung {{contains}} cells that look like breast cells, the doctor determines that the lung tumor is a secondary tumor. Still, the determination of the primary tumor can often be very difficult, and the pathologist may have to use several adjuvant techniques, such as immunohistochemistry, FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization), and others. Despite the use of techniques, in some cases the primary tumor remains unidentified.|$|E
25|$|These earlier methods had flaws {{that were}} easily exploitable. The average run-rate method took no {{account of how}} many wickets were lost by the team batting second, but simply {{reflected}} how quickly they were scoring when the match was interrupted. <b>So</b> <b>if</b> <b>a</b> team felt a rain stoppage was likely, they could attempt to force the scoring rate without regard for the corresponding highly likely loss of wickets, skewing the comparison with the first team. The most productive overs method also took no account of wickets lost by the team batting second, and effectively penalized the team batting second for good bowling, by ignoring their best overs in setting the revised target.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} theorized that the Chryse basin may have {{contained}} a large lake or an ocean during the Hesperian or early Amazonian periods {{since all of}} the large outflow channels entering it end at the same elevation, at which some surface features suggest an ancient shoreline may be present. Chryse basin opens into the North Polar Basin, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>an</b> ocean was present Chryse {{would have been a}} large bay.|$|R
50|$|This equation, called Schrödinger's equation, {{describes}} {{the behavior of}} an isolated or closed quantum system, that is, by definition, a system which does not interchange information (i.e. energy and/or matter) with another system. <b>So</b> <b>if</b> <b>an</b> isolated system is in some pure state |ψ(t) ∈ H at time t, where H denotes the Hilbert space of the system, the time evolution of this state (between two consecutive measurements).|$|R
