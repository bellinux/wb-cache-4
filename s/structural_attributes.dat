One specific example in the Chilean evergreen rainforest is the abundant flora of endemic epiphytic plants that depend on emergent trees (Díaz et al. 2010) and their greater frequency on trees with large diameters (Muñoz et al. 2003). Furthermore, bird species diversity in the evergreen forest type can be predicted {{by the presence of}} emergent trees, and their diversity is consequently higher in old-growth than in early or mid-successional forest stands (Díaz et al. 2005). It follows that a certain number of large-sized, especially emergent trees, in managed stands is crucial for biodiversity conservation.

5000|$|In {{the mid to}} {{late nineteenth}} century, it became popular for type {{foundries}} to offer reverse-contrast variants of Clarendon, a popular slab serif type genre, especially in the United States, creating large block serifs at {{the top and bottom of}} the letter. This was known as French Clarendon type. The advantage of French Clarendon type was that it allowed very large, eye-catching serifs while the letters remained narrow, suiting the desire of poster-makers for condensed but very bold type. French Clarendon types are often associated with wild-west printing and seen on circus posters and wanted notices in western movies, although the style was really used in many parts of the world during this period. The style is sometimes called 'circus letter'. The practice was less popular with Arts and Crafts movement printers: DeVinne commented in 1902 that [...] "To be hated, it needs but to be seen." [...] In Europe the style was sometimes called Italienne, matching the Caslon name. In contrast to the original Caslon type, which features horizontals in the middle of the letter (like the cross-bar in the H) that are often but not always thick, French Clarendon types have the only thick lines at the top and botton, and all inner horizontals thin. Although Bodoni and Didot fuelled their designs with the calligraphic practices of their time, they created new forms that collided with typographic tradition and unleashed a strange new world, where the <b>structural</b> <b>attributes</b> of the letter-serif and stem, thick and thin strokes, vertical and horizontal stress-would be subject to bizarre experiments...Fonts of astonishing height, width and depth appeared: expanded, contracted, shadowed, inlined, fattened, faceted and floriated. Serifs abandoned their role as finishing details to become independent architectural structures, and the vertical stress of traditional letters canted in new directions. Ellen Lupton French Clarendon designs were often created in wood type, used for large-print letters on posters. The University of Texas at Austin, which maintains a large archive of American wood type, reports that the first known wood French Clarendon type was issued by William Hamilton Page in 1865. Their collection shows the many other names used for wood type which display reverse-contrast characteristics, including 'Celtic', 'Belgian', 'Aldine' and 'Teutonic', as well as Italian again and sometimes 'Tuscan' or 'Etruscan' also. (At the time a separation did not fully exist between genre names and typeface names, so these may be the names of individual types, or if they proved popular the name of the subgenre they created.) At least one sans-serif typeface with reverse contrast was developed in this period.|$|E
30|$|We {{examined}} {{changes in}} forest structure and tree species composition {{as well as}} possible detrimental effects on key attributes of old-growthness in stands managed through single-tree selection cutting. Through both harvest variants, high and low residual basal areas (HRBA and LRBA), a balanced, uneven-aged structure with reverse-J diameter distribution and forest cover were maintained. Also, a sufficient growing stock of small-sized trees was kept. Moreover, neither tree species richness, diversity and evenness, nor the presence of less frequent species were negatively affected on the short term. As the effects on tree regeneration remain unknown, {{using a combination of}} HRBA and LRBA may be advisable to support good development of relatively fast-growing and valuable mid-tolerant tree species associated with shade-tolerant ones. The only negative effect detected was the clearly lower number of large-sized and emergent trees in managed plots (especially for LRBA), which are a key <b>structural</b> <b>attribute</b> of old-growth forests and crucial for biodiversity conservation. These results suggest that single-tree selection cutting, if adjusted to retain a certain number of large-sized and emergent trees, can serve as a possible means to preserve many old-growth <b>structural</b> and compositional <b>attributes</b> of the evergreen forest type in managed stands while harvesting timber for the landowners. Future experiments should test the effects of alternative selection cutting upon structural heterogeneity, diversity and productivity to balance the varied societal demands of ecosystem services expected from forest management.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In recent years, many {{networks}} have become available for analysis, including social networks, sensor net-works, biological networks, etc. Graph clustering has shown its effectiveness in analyzing and visualizing large networks. The goal of graph clustering is to partition vertices {{in a large}} graph into clusters based on various criteria such as vertex connectivity or neighborhood similarity. Many existing graph clustering methods mainly focus on the topological structures, but largely ignore the vertex properties which are often heterogeneous. Recently, a new graph clustering algorithm, SA-Cluster, has been proposed which combines <b>structural</b> and <b>attribute</b> similarities through a unified distance measure. SA-Cluster performs matrix multiplication to calculate the random walk distances between graph vertices. As the edge weights are iteratively adjusted to balance the importance between <b>structural</b> and <b>attribute</b> similarities, matrix multiplication is repeated in each iteration of the clustering process to recalcu-late the random walk distances which {{are affected by the}} edge weight update. In order to improve the efficiency and scalability of SA-Cluster, in this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm Inc-Cluster to incrementally update the random walk distances given the edge weight increments. Complexity analysis is provided to estimate how much runtime cost Inc-Cluster can save. Experimental results demonstrate that Inc-Cluster achieves significant speedup over SA-Cluster on large graphs, while achieving exactly the same clustering quality in terms of intra-cluster <b>structural</b> cohesiveness and <b>attribute</b> value homogeneity.
