In an effort to advance understanding of hypersexuality, we review the largely separate literatures on hypersexuality and emotion dysregulation, which has recently been suggested to be {{a critical factor in}} the development and maintenance of mental health problems. Unfortunately, there is also a lack of consensus on the various primary and intervening factors involved in development of emotion regulation or emotion dysregulation. First, we review theories and empirical evidence to try to explain how emotion dysregulation could contribute to the onset of hypersexuality or other inappropriate sexual behavior. Next, an attachment-theory perspective is used to develop a common etiological model for both emotion dysregulation and hypersexuality. Finally, we address the issue of hypersexual behavior in the context of couple relationships, taking an interpersonal perspective on emotion and emotion regulation.

40|$|Studies on prototypical {{systems that}} {{consist of a}} set of complex <b>attachments,</b> <b>coupled</b> to a primary {{structure}} characterized by a single degree of freedom system, have shown that vibratory energy can be transported away from the primary through use of complex undamped resonators. Properties and use of these subsystems as by energy absorbers have also been proposed, particularly using attachments that consist of a large set of resonators. These ideas have been originally developed for linear systems and they provided insight into energy sharing phenomenon in large structures like ships, airplanes, and cars, where interior substructures interact with a master structure, e. g., the hull, the fuselage, or the car body. This paper examines the effects of nonlinearities that develop in the attachments, making them even more complex. Specifically, two different nonlinearities are considered: (1) Those generated by impacts that develop among the attached resonators, and (2) parametric effects produced by time-varying stiffness of the resonators. Both the impacts and the parametric effects improve the results obtained using linear oscillators in terms of inhibiting transported energy from returning to the primary structure. The results are indeed comparable with those obtained using linear oscillators but with special frequency distributions, as in the findings of some recent papers by the same authors. Numerically obtained results show how energy is confined among the attached oscillator...|$|R

A blurry input image (third image) {{and the result}} of our method (fourth image). The blur kernel at each corner of the image is shown at 2 × size. We present a deblurring algorithm that uses a hardware <b>attachment</b> <b>coupled</b> with a natural image prior to deblur images from consumer cameras. Our approach uses a combination of inexpensive gyroscopes and accelerometers in an energy optimization framework to estimate a blur function from the camera’s acceleration and angular velocity during an exposure. We solve for the camera motion at a high sampling rate during an exposure and infer the latent image using a joint optimization. Our method is completely automatic, handles per-pixel, spatially-varying blur, and out-performs the current leading image-based methods. Our experiments show that it handles large kernels – up to at least 100 pixels, with a typical size of 30 pixels. We also present a method to perform “ground-truth” measurements of camera motion blur. We use this method to validate our hardware and deconvolution approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses 6 DOF inertial sensors for dense, per-pixel spatially-varying image deblurring and the first work to gather dense ground-truth measurements for camera-shake blur. ...|$|R

40|$|Although a {{relationship}} {{has been found in}} some studies between paternal attachment and female sexual behavior, knowledge of this relationship in African Americans has been limited. The purpose of this research was to determine if there was {{a relationship}} between father-daughter attachment, parent teen sexual risk communication and early sexual activity, condom use, history of sexually transmitted infection, global/sexual self-esteem and teen pregnancy in African-American females. An anonymous consent and survey was administered online to N= 113 African American college women (age 18 - 21) attending a southeastern university. Measurements included the Parent Attachment Questionnaire (Father), Rosenberg’s Self-Esteem, Sexual Self-Esteem Inventory (short scale), the PTSRC and a sexual history. Findings of high levels of father attachment were found in this mostly middle class sample but neither attachment nor parent teen sexual risk communication was related to age of vaginal/oral initiation, condom use or sexually transmitted infections. However, attachment was predictive of global self-esteem. In addition, those {{with a high level of}} attachment were 1. 0 times more likely to also have a positive pregnancy test history when maternal support for the father–daughter relationship was low. No relationship was found between sexual self-esteem and paternal attachment or between sexual self-esteem and condom use. Paternal monitoring was associated with older ages of vaginal initiation. Conclusion: Higher paternal <b>attachment</b> <b>coupled</b> with paternal monitoring may facilitate global self-esteem and be a protective factor against early sexual initiation (vaginal). Fathers are in need of education as to how to stay connected with daughters and to engage in direct and indirect sexual risk communication.
