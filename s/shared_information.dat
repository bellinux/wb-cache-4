5|$|The head of {{the project}} was Yoshihisa Hashimoto, Square Enix's Chief Technology Officer, who had moved over to the company from Sonic Team in 2009 and became {{involved}} with development in 2011. Other key Square Enix staff members working on Luminous Studio include Takeshi Nozue, Akira Iwata and Hiroshi Iwasaki. While ground work was being laid for Luminous, members of the team traveled to look at engine technology being developed by IO Interactive, Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montréal, western video game developers who became subsidiaries after the company bought out Eidos Interactive. Square Enix's western subsidiaries <b>shared</b> <b>information</b> about game engine development from their experience developing the CDC and Glacier 2 game engines and shared their source code with the Luminous Studio team. During 2012, one third of the final development team was from western subsidiaries of the company. Luminous was developed based on high-end DirectX 11 technology. While designed for eighth-generation video games, it was said to also be compatible with any console and hardware that could handle shaders, such as PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Its compatibility with Nintendo's seventh-gen hardware such as the Wii and Nintendo 3DS was doubted, as those consoles did not support shaders. During this early stage, they were looking into the possibility of adjusting the engine for use on Wii U. The company were hoping to promote Luminous as a kind of brand, showing off the logo and tech demo when they were ready.|$|E

40|$|This study proposes {{and tests}} an {{integrative}} model {{to examine the}} relationships among customers’ willingness to <b>share</b> <b>information,</b> satisfaction, perceived value, and loyalty in a retailing context. This study extends research on customers’ willingness to <b>share</b> <b>information</b> from trust and privacy concerns toward key outcome measures such as perceived value, customer satisfaction, and loyalty, and is thus {{among the first to}} model customers’ willingness to <b>share</b> <b>information</b> with companies in robust theoretical retailing frameworks. The proposed relationships were tested using data from two retailing contexts – groceries (N = 429) and do-it-yourself (DIY) (N = 895). Findings from the two samples suggest that both perceived value and satisfaction are significant determinants of customers’ willingness to <b>share</b> <b>information</b> with a company. Although some differences emerge in the two studies, structural modeling largely supports the hypothesized framework and positions customers’ willingness to <b>share</b> <b>information</b> as an important antecedent of their loyalty intentions and behavior. This study provides practitioners with preliminary insight into the relationship between willingness to <b>share</b> <b>information</b> and perceived value, customer satisfaction, and customer loyalty. This study advances retailing research, as {{it is one of the}} few empirical studies investigating the role of customers’ willingness to <b>share</b> <b>information</b> in driving loyalty and its relationship with perceived value and satisfaction in a retailing context...|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{coherence}} directories track <b>sharing</b> <b>information</b> at a cache-line granularity. In practice, however, as {{data sharing}} occurs at a coarser granularity {{in a large}} region of memory, common sharing patterns tend to be observed across multiple proximate lines. Hence, the directory entries for the lines replicate the same <b>sharing</b> <b>information,</b> resulting in inefficient use of space, power, and energy. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate "region-level sharing pattern locality", that is, {{a small number of}} distinct sharing patterns are observed across proximate lines within a large region of memory, e. g., a page unit. We leverage this phenomenon to propose a new representation of <b>sharing</b> <b>information,</b> called Region-level <b>Sharing</b> <b>information</b> Tracking (RST), that dynamically maintains common <b>sharing</b> <b>information</b> in a space-efficient manner at a region-level.

40|$|We {{provide the}} first {{systematic}} empirical analysis of how asymmetric information and {{competition in the}} credit market affect voluntary <b>information</b> <b>sharing</b> between lenders. We study an experimental credit market in which <b>information</b> <b>sharing</b> can help lenders to distinguish good borrowers from bad ones. Lenders may, however, also lose market power by <b>sharing</b> <b>information</b> with competitors. Our results suggest that asymmetric information in the credit market increases the frequency of <b>information</b> <b>sharing</b> between lenders significantly. Stronger competition between lenders reduces <b>information</b> <b>sharing.</b> In credit markets where lenders may fail to coordinate on <b>sharing</b> <b>information,</b> the degree of information asymmetry, rather than lender competition, drives actual <b>information</b> <b>sharing</b> behavior. ...|$|R

The eventual flow of intercepted and decrypted information was tightly and capriciously controlled. At times, even President Roosevelt did not receive all information from code-breaking activities. There were fears of compromise as a result of poor security after a memo dealing with Magic was found in the desk of Brigadier General Edwin M. (Pa) Watson, the President's military aide.|$|E
40|$|The model studies <b>information</b> <b>sharing</b> and the {{stability}} of cooperation in cost reducing Research Joint Ventures (RJVs). In a four-stage game-theoretic framework, firms decide on participation in a RJV, <b>information</b> <b>sharing,</b> R&D expenditures, and output. An important feature of the model is that voluntary <b>information</b> <b>sharing</b> between cooperating firms increases information leakage from the RJV to outsiders. It is found {{that it is the}} spillover from the RJV to outsiders which determines the decision of insiders whether to <b>share</b> <b>information,</b> while it is the spillover affecting all firms which determines the level of <b>information</b> <b>sharing</b> within the RJV. RJVs representing a larger portion of firms in the industry are more likely to <b>share</b> <b>information.</b> It is also found that when <b>sharing</b> <b>information</b> is costless, firms never choose intermediate levels of <b>information</b> <b>sharing</b> : they <b>share</b> all the <b>information</b> or none at all. The size of the RJV is found to depend on three effects : a coordination effect, an <b>information</b> <b>sharing</b> effect, and a competition effect. Depending on the relative magnitudes of these effects, the size of the RJV may increase or decrease with spillovers.
