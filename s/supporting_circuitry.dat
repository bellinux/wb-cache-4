40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 158 - 162) This paper {{presents a}} systems {{approach to the}} proper selection of a microprocessor CPU (central processing unit). This selection process is addressed {{in the context of}} incorporating the microprocessor as the general purpose, stored program, digital computer element in a ground support equipment controller. Addressing the problem in this manner allows quantitative illustration of the methodology involved. However, the basic approach is applicable wherever it is desired to incorporate microprocessor technology into a controller design. The approach taken in this paper consists of two phases, termed the functional capability review phase, and the cost effectiveness evaluation phase. The functional capability review phase addresses the important functions and features of the CPU integrated circuit, and the required <b>support</b> <b>circuitry</b> to enable it to function as a digital computer. Also discussed are the hardware/software development aids which are required and most often desired, to develop the microcomputer (CPU plus <b>support</b> <b>circuitry)</b> hardware and its associated software. Having gained a detailed understanding of the functional capabilities and interrelationships of the CPU, <b>support</b> <b>circuitry,</b> and hardware/software development aids, the systems designer evaluates this capability in relation to the design problem requirements through a cost effectiveness evaluation. The cost effectiveness evaluation, developed using utility theory and sensitivity analysis, enhances the knowledge gained from the functional capability review by projecting the impacts of the capabilities into the probability of success of the system design. This two-phase approach extends the system designer's decision making ability by allowing him to couple the technical intricacies of microprocessor technology with insights into the ultimate cost effectiveness resulting from the alternative courses of action available to him for implementing the microprocessor based design...|$|R

50|$|The JX-8P, JX-10 and the MKS-70 use vacuum {{fluorescent}} displays {{which give}} the instruments their characteristic green/blue glowing display. In some cases these displays can fail with age, indicating 888888888888 or having other issues. One cause {{of these problems}} is the corrosion of a small coil component in the display driver circuit. While Roland used similar displays across a number of products at this time, interchangeability of displays between products is limited.

5000|$|Additional 1108 {{hardware}} instructions included {{double precision}} arithmetic, double-word load, store, and comparison instructions. The processor could {{have up to}} 16 input/output channels for peripherals. The 1108 CPU was, {{with the exception of}} the 128-word (200 octal) ICR (Integrated Control Register) stack, entirely implemented via discrete component logic cards, each with a 55-pin high density connector, which interfaced to a machine wire wrapped backplane. Additional hand applied twisted pair wiring was utilized to implement backplane connections with sensitive timing, connections between machine wire wrapped backplanes, and connections to the I/O channel connector panel in the lower section of the CPU Cabinet. The ICR (Integrated Control Register) stack was implemented with [...] "new" [...] integrated circuit technology, replacing the thin film registers on the 1107. The ICR consisted of 128 38-bits, with a half-word Parity Bit calculated and checked with each access. The ICR was logically the first 128 memory addresses (200 Octal), but was contained in the CPU. The core memory was contained in a one or more separate cabinet(s), and consisted of two separate 32K modules, for a total capacity of 64K 38-bit words (36-bits data and a Parity Bit for each 18-bit half-word). The basic cycle time of the core memory was 750 ns, and the <b>supporting</b> <b>circuitry</b> was implemented with the same circuit card/backplane technology as the 1108 CPU.|$|E
5000|$|The {{prototype}} {{produced by}} Yannes had {{very few of}} the features required for a real computer, so Robert Russell at Commodore headquarters had to coordinate and finish large parts of the design under the codename Vixen. The parts contributed by Russell included a port of the operating system (kernel and BASIC interpreter) taken from John Feagans design for the Commodore PET, a character set with the characteristic PETSCII, an Atari 2600-compatible joystick interface, and a ROM cartridge port. The serial IEEE 488-derivative CBM-488 interface (which could use far cheaper cabling than a real IEEE-488 as was used on the PET) was designed by Glen Stark. Some features, like the memory add-in board, were designed by Bill Seiler. Altogether, the VIC 20 development team consisted of five people, who referred to themselves as the VIC Commandos. According to one of the development team, Neil Harris, [...] "We couldn't get any cooperation {{from the rest of the}} company who thought we were jokers because we were working late, about an hour after everyone else had left the building. We'd swipe whatever equipment we needed to get our jobs done. There was no other way to get the work done! ... they'd discover it was missing and they would just order more stuff from the warehouse, so everybody had what they needed to do their work." [...] At the time, Commodore had an oversupply of 1 kbit×4 SRAM chips, so Tramiel decided that these should be used in the new computer. The end result was arguably closer to the PET or TOI computers than to Yannes' prototype, albeit with a 22-column VIC chip instead of the custom chips designed for the more ambitious computers. As the amount of memory on the VIC-20's system board was very small even for 1981 standards, the design team could get away with using more expensive SRAM due to its lower power consumption, heat output, and less <b>supporting</b> <b>circuitry.</b> The original Revision A system board found in all silver-label VIC-20s used 2114 SRAMs and due to their tiny size (only 512 bytes per chip), ten of them were required to reach 5k of system RAM. The Revision B system board, found in rainbow logo VIC-20s (see below) switched to larger 2048 byte SRAMs which reduced the memory count to five chips: 2 x 2048 bytes chips + 3 x 2114 (the 1024 x 4 bits) chips.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a method of}} using an FPGA-based {{emulation}} system for fault grading. The real-time sim-ulation capability of a hardware emulator could signifi-cantly improve the run-time of fault grading, {{which is one of}} the most resource-intensive tasks in the design process. A serial fault emulation algorithm is employed and enhanced by two speed-up techniques. First, a set of independent faults can be emulated in parallel. Second, simultaneous injection of multiple dependent faults is also possible by adding extra <b>supporting</b> <b>circuitry.</b> Because the reconfigura-tion time spent on mapping the numerous faulty circuits into the FPGA boards could be the bottleneck of the whole pro-cess, using extra logic for injecting a large number of faults per configuration can reduce the number of reconfigura-tions, and thus, significantly improve the efficiency. Some modeling issues that are unique in the fault emulation envi-ronment are also addressed. The performance estimation indicates that this approach could be several orders of mag-nitude faster than the existing software approaches for large designs. ...|$|E
