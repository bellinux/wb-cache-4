25|$|The {{ignition}} coil {{consists of two}} transformer windings — the primary and secondary. These windings share a common magnetic core. An alternating current in the primary induces an alternating magnetic field in the core and hence an alternating current in the secondary. The {{ignition coil}}'s secondary has more turns than the primary. This is a <b>step-up</b> <b>transformer,</b> which produces a high voltage from the secondary winding.|$|E
25|$|A {{general-purpose}} amplifier {{with typical}} low-impedance output is used. Its output {{is connected to}} the primary of an external <b>step-up</b> <b>transformer.</b> Special-purpose transformers can tailor the system design to the project's target power levels. Multiple amplifiers can be combined together via transformers to yield higher voltage and higher current capacity lines. For instance, three 70-volt amplifiers have been used to make a 210-volt line by connecting them to a special-purpose external output transformer that has three primaries and a single secondary.|$|E

25|$|Most nuclear {{stations}} require {{two distinct}} sources of offsite {{power feeding station}} service transformers that are sufficiently separated in the station's switchyard and can receive power from multiple transmission lines. In addition in some nuclear stations the turbine generator can power the station's house loads while the station is online via station service transformers which tap power from the generator output bus bars {{before they reach the}} <b>step-up</b> <b>transformer</b> (these stations also have station service transformers that receive offsite power directly from the switch yard). Even with the redundancy of two power sources total loss of offsite power is still possible. Nuclear power stations are equipped with emergency power.|$|E

It may be powered {{by one or more}} batteries depending on manufacturer and model. The amount of amperage generated depends on what stunning capabilities are desired, but without proper amperage calculations, the cause and effect of high voltage is muted. Output voltage is claimed to be in the range of 100 V up to 6 KV; current intensity output is claimed to be in the range of 100 to 500 mA; individual impulse duration is claimed to be in the range of 10 to 100 µs (microseconds); frequency of impulse is claimed to be in the range of 2 to 40 Hz; electrical charge delivered is claimed to be in the range of 15 to 500 µC (micro-Coulomb); energy delivered is claimed to be in the range of 0.9 to 10 J.|$|E

50|$|A common {{modified}} {{sine wave}} inverter topology found in consumer power inverters is as follows:An onboard microcontroller rapidly switches on and off power MOSFETs at high frequency like ~50 kHz. The MOSFETs directly pull from a low voltage DC source (such as a battery). This signal then goes through <b>step-up</b> <b>transformers</b> (generally many smaller transformers are placed in parallel to reduce the overall size of the inverter) to produce a higher voltage signal. The output of the <b>step-up</b> <b>transformers</b> then gets filtered by capacitors to produce a high voltage DC supply. Finally, this DC supply is pulsed with additional power MOSFETs by the microcontroller to produce the final modified sine wave signal.|$|R

500|$|An {{electrostatic}} speaker {{has only a}} frame to support the charged diaphragm. It uses ultra-thin stretched Mylar (Biaxially-oriented polyethylene terephthalate) film as {{the main component of}} its drive units. There are two perforated plates with a potential difference of up to 10,000 volts, between which a very thin film, coated with a mildly electrically conductive substance, is sandwiched. Sound is produced when the audio signal [...] amplified by a <b>step-up</b> <b>transformer</b> [...] sets the film diaphragm into motion. The different charge between the two plates allows the diaphragm to be alternately attracted and repelled by each plate.

500|$|VFDs are {{available}} with voltage and current ratings covering {{a wide range of}} single-phase and multi-phase AC motors. Low-voltage (LV) drives are designed to operate at output voltages equal to or less than 690V. While motor-application LV drives {{are available}} in ratings of up to the order of 5or6 MW, economic considerations typically favor medium-voltage (MV) drives with much lower power ratings. [...] Different MV drive topologies (see Table 2) are configured in accordance with the voltage/current-combination ratings used in different drive controllers' switching devices such that any given voltage rating is {{greater than or equal to}} one to the following standard nominal motor voltage ratings: generally either 2.3/4.16kV (60Hz) or 3.3/6.6kV (50Hz), with one thyristor manufacturer rated for up to 12kV switching. In some applications a <b>step-up</b> <b>transformer</b> is placed between a LV drive and a MV motor load. MV drives are typically rated for motor applications [...] greater than between about 375kW (500HP) and 750kW (1000hp).

2500|$|The {{advantage}} of the ribbon microphone when introduced was that the light ribbon had a much higher natural resonant frequency than diaphragms in existing microphones, above hearing range, so it had flatter response at high frequencies. [...] The voltage output of older ribbon microphones is typically quite low compared to a dynamic moving coil microphone, and a <b>step-up</b> <b>transformer</b> is used to increase the voltage output and increase the output impedance. Modern ribbon microphones do not suffer from this problem due to improved magnets and more efficient transformers and have output levels that can exceed typical stage dynamic microphones.|$|E

2500|$|The {{generator}} voltage {{for modern}} utility-connected generators ranges from [...] in smaller units to [...] in larger units.

50|$|The {{short circuit}} {{inductance}} {{value of the}} <b>step-up</b> <b>transformer</b> is further increased {{from that of the}} three-times resonance design. The capacitance component of the secondary side circuit is also increased.|$|E
50|$|The {{transformer}} {{which is}} actually used in the so-called three-times resonance circuit has a flat shape. Although the magnetic path structure is closed, the leakage of the magnetic flux is considerably more {{than that of the}} conventional type. The transformer therefore has a larger short circuit inductance value. The design (refer to figure of the “past generation of technology“) is such that the short circuit inductance value of the <b>step-up</b> <b>transformer</b> is increased to some degree, whereby a resonance circuit is created by the short circuit inductance (Lsc in the figures) and a capacitance component obtained on the secondary side of the <b>step-up</b> <b>transformer.</b> The resonance frequency of the circuit is set to a frequency three times as high as the operating frequency of the inverter circuit in order to generate a third-order harmonic in the secondary side circuit. The lamp current waveform has a trapezoid shape. The ballast capacitor Crb also functions as a resonance capacitor. As a result the conversion efficiency of the inverter circuit is considerably improved, and the <b>step-up</b> <b>transformer</b> is further miniaturized.|$|E

50|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, {{the need for}} a sub-transmission network became apparent, and in 1967 the AEPB {{established}} its first 33 kV subtransmission lines and zone substations, supplied by three 11/33 kV <b>step-up</b> <b>transformers</b> at Ashburton substation. In 1971, the last 6.6 kV lines were converted to 11 kV. As irrigation loads increased and the subtransmission network was extended into the 1980s, two 110/33 kV grid connections were established at Ashburton and Cairnbrae, near Methven, to supply the network. The AEPB also established a 1.8 MW hydroelectric power station at Montalto in 1982.|$|R

50|$|A further {{transient}} {{problem is}} that with a single coil construction and a star switch, the autotransformer acts as a <b>step-up</b> <b>transformer</b> during the <5 microsecond period at contact separation of the Star point switch.
