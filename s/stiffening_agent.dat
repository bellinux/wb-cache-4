40|$|Implantable {{devices to}} record and stimulate neural {{circuits}} {{have led to}} breakthroughs in neuroscience; however, technologies capable of electrical recording at the cellular level typically rely on rigid metals that poorly match the mechanical properties of soft brain tissue. As a result these electrodes often cause extensive acute and chronic injury, leading to short electrode lifetime. Recently, flexible electrodes such as Carbon Nanotube fibers (CNTf) have emerged as an attractive alternative to conventional electrodes and {{studies have shown that}} these flexible electrodes reduce neuro-inflammation and increase the quality and longevity of neural recordings. Insertion of these new compliant electrodes, however, remains challenge. The <b>stiffening</b> <b>agents</b> necessary to make the electrodes rigid enough to be inserted increases device footprint, which exacerbates brain damage during implantation. To overcome this challenge we have developed a novel technology to precisely implant and actuate high-performance, flexible carbon nanotube fiber (CNTf) microelectrodes without using a <b>stiffening</b> <b>agents</b> or shuttles. Instead, our technology uses drag forces within a microfluidic device to drive electrodes into tissue while minimizing the amount of fluid that is ejected into the tissue. In vitro experiments in brain phantoms, show that microfluidic actuated CNTf can be implanted at least 4. 5 mm depth with 30 μm precision, while keeping the total volume of fluid ejected below 0. 1 μL. As proof of concept, we inserted CNTfs in the small cnidarian Hydra littoralis and observed compound action potentials corresponding to contractions and in agreement with the literature. Additionally, brain slices extracted from transgenic mice were used to show that our device can be used to record spontaneous and light evoked activity from the cortex and deep brain regions such as the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). Overall our microfluidic actuation technology provides a platform for implanting and actuating flexible electrodes that significantly reduces damage during insertion...|$|R
30|$|Starch accumulates {{in plants}} {{as a complex}} {{carbohydrate}} form. There are various types of starch: the common corn/maize starch, tapioca starch, and wheat, rice and potato starch. The starch is insoluble in cold water, but dissolves in warm water. Dissolved starch in warm water makes starch paste [16]. The starch paste is used as thickening, <b>stiffening</b> or gluing <b>agent.</b> In this study, the tapioca starch (Pine Brand, Sitthinan Company Ltd.) from Central Department Store, Rattanathibet, Nonthaburi Province, Thailand was used.|$|R
40|$|It {{is usually}} {{difficult}} for a beginner to understand precisely and quickly the three-dimensional (3 D) construction of gastric lesions in a gastric X-ray examination with barium meal. In this study, a training-use stomach phantom was developed using the stomach segment to provide beginners {{with an understanding of}} 3 D stomach construction. The hook-shaped phantom (the shape of the stomach when a patient is in the supine position) was formed by using styrene, wire, and clay. It was then coated with dental <b>stiffening</b> <b>agent,</b> and wires were attached along the stomach segment. After drying, the stomach phantom was cut off and the oil clay was removed. The phantom then was immersed in water and the oil clay was dried. After that, the phantom again was glued together with a dental <b>stiffening</b> <b>agent.</b> The usefulness of the phantom was determined by an evaluation experiment. Ten students, as observers, were selected randomly for evaluation from 40 students of the Department of Radiological Technology, College of Medical Technology, Hokkaido University. Eight films were shown to the observers, 4 films with segment and 4 films without segment. The observers checked 5 markers in different positions of the phantom and recorded the results on an answer sheet with segment picture. The significance of position recognition was identified by Wilcoxon's sign rank sum test (p= 0. 021) between the segment film and non-segment film. 臨床技...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, poly (vinylalcohol glycidyl ether) (PVAGE) was {{synthesized}} as a novel reactive <b>stiffening</b> <b>agent</b> {{to improve}} the stiffness of cotton fabric. Cotton fabric could be grafted with PVAGE under high temperature and the grafting rate would increase {{with the increase of}} PVAGE concentration. The cotton fabric grafted with PVAGE has excellent washing durability. The wearability of cotton fabric grafted with PVAGE was also studied. As the increase of grafting rate, the flexural stiffness increased dramaticly; tensile strength increased a little; cockle elastic decreased slightly; and air permeability and whiteness also decreased but were still in acceptable range...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Petrographic {{evidence}} of thin sheet-like or platelet-shaped quartz cement parallel to bedding is documented in deeply buried, originally smectite-rich, Late Cretaceous mudstones from well 6505 / 10 - 1 in the Vøring Basin, offshore Norway. The platelets are mainly built up of areas of patchy continuous quartz cement with various amounts of earlier-formed interlock-ing microquartz crystals. Cathode luminescence (CL) spectra confirm an authigenic origin for the quartz cement. The quartz platelets may originate as flakes (at c. 90 – 100 (C) that may evolve into well-developed near-continuous patchy quartz cement identified at 4300 m/ 150 (C. The quartz cement is probably sourced from silica {{released by the}} clay dissolution-precipitation processes (smectite and smectite/illite to illite and kaolinite to illite). At temperatures above about 90 – 100 (C, the continuous supply of silica from these clay mineral reactions results in precipitation of quartz flakes and sheet-like quartz cement. The quartz sheets may act as a mudrock <b>stiffening</b> <b>agent,</b> reinforcing and further cementing together the microquartz networks and aggregates and possibly also enhancing the schistosity and anisotropy of these mudstones during increasing burial. The quartz sheets may also act as vertical permeability barriers in the sediment possibly contributing to over-pressure formation during chemical compaction...|$|E
50|$|In industry, starch is {{converted}} into sugars, for example by malting, and fermented to produce ethanol {{in the manufacture}} of beer, whisky and biofuel. It is processed to produce many of the sugars used in processed foods. Dissolving starch in warm water gives wheatpaste, which {{can be used as a}} thickening, <b>stiffening</b> or gluing <b>agent.</b> The biggest industrial non-food use of starch is as an adhesive in the papermaking process. Starch can be applied to parts of some garments before ironing, to stiffen them.|$|R
40|$|A multi-scale {{method is}} {{utilized}} to determine {{some of the}} constitutive properties of a three component graphite-epoxy-nanotube system. This system is of interest because carbon nanotubes have been proposed as <b>stiffening</b> and toughening <b>agents</b> in the interlaminar regions of carbon fiber/epoxy laminates. The multi-scale method uses molecular dynamics simulation and equivalent-continuum modeling to compute three of the elastic constants of the graphite-epoxy-nanotube system: C 11, C 22, and C 33. The 1 -direction is along the nanotube axis, and the graphene sheets lie in the 1 - 2 plane. It {{was found that the}} C 11 is only 4 % larger than the C 22. The nanotube therefore does have a small, but positive effect on the constitutive properties in the interlaminar region...|$|R
5|$|While {{historically}} {{thought of}} as simple leathery structures composed of skin, research has since shown that the wing membranes of pterosaurs were highly complex dynamic structures suited to an active style of flight. The outer wings (from the tip to the elbow) were strengthened by closely spaced fibers called actinofibrils. The actinofibrils themselves consisted of three distinct layers in the wing, forming a crisscross pattern when superimposed on one another. The function of the actinofibrils is unknown, as is the exact material from which they were made. Depending on their exact composition (keratin, muscle, elastic structures, etc.), {{they may have been}} <b>stiffening</b> or strengthening <b>agents</b> in the outer part of the wing. The wing membranes also contained a thin layer of muscle, fibrous tissue, and a unique, complex circulatory system of looping blood vessels.|$|R
40|$|In Sri Lanka, farmers get a {{very good}} yield in some rice growing seasons, {{and as a result}} there is excess rice in the country causing storage problems. Rice starch {{production}} is a way of adding value to this excess rice, there by reducing post harvest losses. There are many useful applications of rice starch in the food industries such as noodles, rice bread, baby foods and it is also used as dairy alternatives. In addition, it is being used as a dusting powder and as a filler in the pharmaceutical industry and as a laundry <b>stiffening</b> <b>agent</b> in the textile industry (Burrell, 2003). Currently there is no rice starch production in Sri Lanka and the total local requirement is met by imported starches. Hence it will be beneficial to produce rice starch locally to meet the demand for starch in Sri Lanka. Most important part of the production of rice starch is to remove rice protein and the separation of small starch granules by using an appropriate method. The removal of rice protein is important as the surface activity of protein can lead to foaming in starch processing, reduction of starch yield by endoamylolytic activity of some surface-bound enzymes and formation of Maillard products during hydrolysis of starch. Rice protein consists of glutelin (80 %), albumin (5 %), globulin (12 %) and prolamin (3 %) which is dissolved in alkali, water, salt and ethanol respectively (Juliano, 1985). Chemical, physical and biological methods are used in rice starch manufacturing process...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} the switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), a biomass crop being {{developed}} in North America and Europe, was tested as a <b>stiffening</b> and reinforcing <b>agent</b> in polypropylene (PP) composites {{with and without}} maleic anhydride grafted PP (MAPP) as a compatibiliser and to evaluate the effect of pulping and different sources of switchgrass on composite characteristics. The refiner pulping yield for two switchgrass varieties was estimated between 70 ¿ 80 &Eth;The addition of 30 øby weight) switchgrass pulp resulted in an increase of the flexural modulus {{by a factor of}} about 2. 5 compared to pure polypropylene. Which was only slightly lower than values found for jute and flax. The flexural strength of PP composites reinforced with pulped switchgrass and MAPP was almost doubled compared to pure PP and approached values found for jute and flax. The compatibilising effect of MAPP has been visualised by micrographs. The good mechanical properties are achieved despite the severe fibre length reduction as a result of thermoplastic compounding which is shown by fibre length analysis. The impact strength of switchgrass/PP composites was much lower than for pure PP. The use of different switchgrass varieties and harvesting time had a minor to no effect on the mechanical performance of the respective composites. The chemical composition of different varieties was fairly constant. The low price and the relatively good mechanical characteristics should make switchgrass an attractive fibre for filling and stiffening in thermoplastic composites. Further improvement of composite mechanical properties should be possibl...|$|R
