25|$|Corgan played (during the Gish-Siamese Dream era) a {{customized}} '57 Reissue Fender Stratocaster equipped with three Fender Lace Sensor pickups (the Lace Sensor Blue {{in the neck}} position, the Lace Sensor Silver in the middle position, and the Lace Sensor Red at the bridge position). It also has a five-position pickup selector switch which he installed himself. This battered <b>Strat</b> became his number one guitar by default. He owned a '74 <b>Strat</b> that was stolen shortly after Gish was completed.|$|E
25|$|The 0001 <b>Strat</b> is a Fender Stratocaster {{electric}} guitar, {{with a white}} body, maple neck, three-way pick up selector and {{an unusual}} gold colour scratch plate and hardware, owned by David Gilmour. He bought it from guitar technician Phil Taylor, who had purchased it from Seymour Duncan. This guitar {{is one of the}} most notable in his collection as it has the 0001 serial number. Gilmour used the guitar in the 2004 <b>Strat</b> Pack show that commemorated the 50th anniversary of the Stratocaster at Wembley Arena along with one of his Candy Apple Red Strats (famous for their appearances with Gilmour from 1987-2004). It is not the first Fender Stratocaster ever made as prototypes had already been constructed before this one. The origin of the guitar is unknown, and isn't clear whether it is the real 0001 <b>Strat</b> because the neck (which has the 0001 serial number on it) could have been taken off the original.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the paint}} {{was removed from the}} guitar in 1967 or 1968 during the Taste period, as {{evidenced}} from contemporary photographs. No further paint loss was seen over the subsequent twenty five years. Although the <b>Strat</b> was left abandoned in a rainy ditch for days after being stolen from the back of a tour van in Dublin, this is not believed to have caused any ill effect. The paint removal and appearance of extensive road wear was in keeping with Gallaghers public persona and image. A borrowed Telecaster was also stolen at the same time but never recovered. When the <b>Strat</b> was recovered two weeks later, Gallagher swore he would never sell it or paint it.|$|E

25|$|During the {{sessions}} for A Little Ain't Enough, Becker used various Carvin, Ibanez, ESP and Valley Arts guitars, {{as well as}} a Les Paul on some tracks and a Gibson acoustic for select things. Becker has also been pictured with a few Hamer superstrats as well. From 1989–1991, Becker used various guitars, most notably a Peavey custom model with the numbered fretboard markers. Also used were an Ibanez Custom Shop guitar (probably based on an RG), a custom from Performance Guitars, a couple of various unknown <b>Strat</b> style guitars and a black Hurricane with 3 single coil pickups.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, he {{published}} an album featuring Jad Fair and the French noise artist Philippe Petit. He also started a two piece band called Bismuth with multi-instrumentalist Arnold van de Velde. In {{the same year}} he started his <b>Strat</b> Eraser Project and built a series of instruments for direct sale, along with the workshop exclusive models. In November he gave a TEDx talk. Around this time, he began to depart from building stringed instruments. Inspired by the percussive works of Lou Harrison, John Cage, and the Belgian sound artist George Smits, {{and the sounds of}} Indonesian Gamelan instruments, he created a collection of metal percussion instruments and amplified them with guitar pickups. These instruments are widely used on the recordings of Bismuth and in his live performances. Also, he built a set of motor instruments and invented an instrument made from soda pop PET bottles.|$|E
500|$|Peter Frampton {{played two}} natural-finish maple body Pensa-Suhr <b>Strat</b> types, hand-made by New York-based John Suhr. For the song [...] "Zeroes", {{he used a}} Coral {{electric}} sitar, given {{to him in the}} late 70s and previously owned by Jimi Hendrix. Carlos Alomar played on six Kramer American series guitars and one custom Alembic. Multi-instrumentalist Erdal Kizilcay played Yamaha DX7, Emax, Korg SGI and Yamaha CS70 keyboards. He also played a Tokai Stratocaster, a Yamaha GS1000 bass and a Pedulla fretless bass. Additional instruments played included a set of Latin Percussion timbales and white congas, a cowbell, 6- and 8-inch Zildjian cymbals, Promark drum sticks, a Simmons SDS-9, a cornet and a 17th-century Italian viola. Richard Cottle played on two Prophet 5s, an Oberheim, a Yamaha DX7, DX7-IID and KX5 keyboards as well as a Selmer alto saxophone. Carmine Rojas used two Spector basses, and Alan Childs played on Tama Artstar II drums.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, Corgan {{released}} to the market his own Fender Stratocaster. This new guitar was made to Corgan's exact specs to create his famous mid-'90s buzzsaw tone; the instrument features three DiMarzio pickups (two custom for this instrument), a string-through hardtail bridge and a satin nitrocellulose lacquer finish. When playing live, he uses both his signature <b>Strats</b> {{as well as two}} other Fender <b>Strats,</b> one in red with a white pick guard and one in silver-grey with a black pick guard; a Gibson Tony Iommi signature SG; and his Schecter C-1 (only used on the Zeitgeist song [...] "United States").|$|R

500|$|Frusciante's musical {{style has}} evolved {{over the course of}} his career. Although he {{received}} moderate recognition for his early guitar work, it was not until later in his career that music critics and guitarists alike began to fully recognize it: in October 2003, he was ranked eighteenth in Rolling Stones list of the [...] "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time". Frusciante attributes this recent recognition to his shift in focus, stating that he chose an approach based on rhythmic patterns inspired by the complexity of material Jimi Hendrix and Eddie Van Halen produced. On earlier records, however, much of his output was influenced by various underground punk and new wave musicians. In general, his sound is also defined by an affinity for vintage guitars. All the guitars that he owns, records, and tours with were made before 1970. Frusciante will use the specific guitar that he finds appropriate for a certain song. All of the guitars he owned before quitting the band were destroyed when his house burned down in 1996. The first guitar he bought after rejoining the Chili Peppers was a 1962 red Fender Jaguar. His most-often used guitar, however, is a 1962 Sunburst Fender Stratocaster that was given to him as a gift from Anthony Kiedis after Frusciante rejoined the Chili Peppers in 1998. He has played this guitar on every album since rejoining the Chili Peppers, and their ensuing tours. He also owns a 1955 Fender Stratocaster, his only <b>Strat</b> with a maple neck. [...] Frusciante's most highly appraised instrument is a 1955 Gretsch White Falcon, which he used twice per show during the By the Way tour. He has since stopped using it, saying there was [...] "no room for it". Virtually all of Frusciante's acoustic work is played with a 1950s Martin 0–15.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2006, Fender Custom Shop {{announced}} two {{reproductions of}} Gilmour's [...] "Black" [...] <b>Strat</b> for release on 22 September 2008. Phil Taylor, Gilmour's guitar tech, supervised this release {{and has written}} a book on the history of this guitar.

Both guitars are based on extensive measurements of the original instrument, each featuring varying degrees of wear.

A pristine copy of the guitar is also made, called the David Gilmour NOS Stratocaster.|$|E

The first—used during the recording of Eric Clapton—was [...] "Brownie", which in 1973 became the backup to the most famous of all Clapton's guitars, [...] "Blackie". In November 1970 Eric bought six Fender Stratocasters from the Sho-bud guitar shop in Nashville, Tennessee while on tour with the Dominos.
