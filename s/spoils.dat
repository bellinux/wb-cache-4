50|$|Effective {{management}} of <b>spoil</b> is necessary because its volume is in general {{three times that}} which it was before excavation. Best practice involves removing the <b>spoil</b> away from the excavation site by mechanical earth moving equipment, or the creation of barrow run fed <b>spoil</b> heaps. In the barrow run method, a ramp is built using <b>spoil</b> transported in barrows along the barrow runs. The <b>spoil</b> heap is progressively enlarged by tipping off the vertical end face of the barrow-run. This method is efficient in storing {{the maximum amount of}} <b>spoil</b> in the minimum area, where there is no mechanised means of removing <b>spoil</b> a long distance from the site.|$|R
40|$|To {{present a}} {{framework}} in which time-varying gradients are applied with RF <b>spoiling</b> to reduce unwanted signal, particularly at high flip angles. A time-varying gradient spoiler scheme compatible with RF <b>spoiling</b> is defined, in which spoiler gradients cycle through the vertices of a hexagon, which we call hexagonal <b>spoiling.</b> The method is compared with a traditional constant <b>spoiling</b> gradient both in the transition to and in the steady state. Extended phase graph (EPG) simulations, phantom acquisitions, and in vivo images {{were used to assess}} the method. Simulations, phantom and in vivo experiments showed that unwanted signal was markedly reduced by employing hexagonal <b>spoiling,</b> both in the transition to and in the steady state. For adipose tissue at 1. 5 Tesla, the unwanted signal in the steady state with a 60 [*]° flip angle was reduced from 22 % with constant <b>spoiling</b> to 2 % with hexagonal <b>spoiling.</b> A time-varying gradient spoiler scheme that works with RF <b>spoiling,</b> called "hexagonal spoiling," has been presented and found to offer improved <b>spoiling</b> over the traditional constant <b>spoiling</b> gradient...|$|R

40|$|Coal mining {{produces}} {{large quantities}} of waste rock (<b>spoil)</b> of generally sedimentary origin. Current practice involves stacking this <b>spoil</b> in piles up to 150 m high. Plans for future mining are considering <b>spoil</b> piles up to 400 m high. Under the corresponding burial stresses, the <b>spoil</b> materials undergo substantial compressions, leading to decreases in void ratio and increases in their degree of saturation (S r) at constant water content. In this study, a typical <b>spoil</b> derived from Permian-aged sandstones and mudrocks, is subjected to stresses up to 20 MPa, with the corresponding changes in degree of saturation and suction measured. The results show that loose <b>spoil</b> with a water content of around 12 % (S r = 25 %) will collapse to become saturated under a stress of 7 MPa. In contrast, loose <b>spoil</b> with a higher water content of around 16 % will collapse to become saturated under a stress of only 1. 5 MPa. From these results, a phenomenon is identified whereby <b>spoil</b> in the seepage and capillary zones {{at the base of}} very high <b>spoil</b> piles can collapse to a state of saturation. A discussion is provided on the consequences of this for the matric suction and unsaturated shear strength of these <b>spoil</b> materials, which constitute the foundation layer of the pile...|$|R

40|$|<b>Spoil</b> piles are {{produced}} routinely in open cut coal mines. <b>Spoil</b> piles may contain waste coal and other carbonaceous horizons. Coal and carbonaceous materials react with {{oxygen in the}} atmosphere, producing heat. If {{the rate at which}} heat is generated is greater than the rate at which heat can be dissipated, the temperature of the <b>spoil</b> pile rises. If the heating remains unchecked, spontaneous combustion can occur. Spontaneous combustion poses significant safety, environmental and economic problems if it should become established in <b>spoil</b> piles. Using the basic features of self heating in <b>spoil,</b> the use of model is directed toward developing quantitative prediction of spontaneous combustion in open cut coal mine <b>spoil</b> piles...|$|R

40|$|Slope {{failures}} of <b>spoil</b> piles pose a significant safety risk in open-cut strip mining due to slaking over time due to overburden pressure and water saturation. Most <b>spoil</b> pile failures {{occur when the}} pit has been previously filled with water and then subsequently dewatered. It {{is important to understand}} how the mechanical properties of base <b>spoil</b> material are affected by slaking when designing safe <b>spoil</b> pile slope angles, heights, and dewatering rates. A new laboratory slaking chamber (360 mm ID, 400 mm high with 20 mm wall thickness) has been designed and constructed to accommodate approximately 60 kg of <b>spoil</b> (unit weight, 18 kN/m 3) and a simulated overburden pressure of 1000 kPa. Consolidation of the <b>spoil</b> can be measured through a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) attached to the system. Using this apparatus, a fresh <b>spoil</b> material collected from a coal mine in Brown Basin Coalfield of Queensland, Australia was subjected to high overburden pressure (0 – 900 kPa) under saturated condition and maintained {{over a period of time}} (0 – 6 months) allowing the material to slake and successfully tested for classification, permeability, and strength properties. Results suggested that the slaking of saturated coal mine <b>spoil</b> increase with overburden pressure and the time duration over which the overburden pressure was maintained. Shear strength and permeability of <b>spoil</b> decreased with increase in <b>spoil</b> slaking...|$|R
5|$|Soon {{after taking}} office, Cleveland {{was faced with}} the task of filling all the {{government}} jobs for which the president had the power of appointment. These jobs were typically filled under the <b>spoils</b> system, but Cleveland announced that he would not fire any Republican who was doing his job well, and would not appoint anyone {{solely on the basis of}} party service. He also used his appointment powers to reduce the number of federal employees, as many departments had become bloated with political time-servers. Later in his term, as his fellow Democrats chafed at being excluded from the <b>spoils,</b> Cleveland began to replace more of the partisan Republican officeholders with Democrats.; this was especially the case with policy making positions. While some of his decisions were influenced by party concerns, more of Cleveland's appointments were decided by merit alone than was the case in his predecessors' administrations.|$|E

5|$|The {{city was}} {{thoroughly}} sacked and plundered; {{according to the}} Arab accounts, {{the sale of the}} <b>spoils</b> went on for five days. The Byzantine chronicler Theophanes Continuatus mentions 70,000 dead, while the Arab al-Mas'udi records 30,000. The surviving population were divided as slaves among the army leaders, except for the city's military and civic leaders, who were reserved for the caliph's disposal. After allowing Theophilos's envoys to return to him with the news of Amorium's fall, Mu'tasim burned the city to the ground, with only the city walls surviving relatively intact. Among the <b>spoils</b> taken were the massive iron doors of the city, which al-Mu'tasim initially transported to Samarra, where they were installed at the entrance of his palace.

40|$|Despite its {{importance}} to mine planning, very few coal mine operators routinely and accurately measure the net bulking of <b>spoil</b> from their mines. With increasing environmental restrictions and space constraints being imposed on mine sites, {{a better understanding}} of the net bulking of <b>spoil</b> is important, as it affects volume storage requirements both in-pit and, more importantly, out-of-pit. Laboratory compression tests have been undertaken on scalped (to a given maximum size to allow testing) <b>spoil</b> specimens to estimate the self-weight and collapse settlement of coal mine <b>spoil.</b> Degradation testing was carried out by exposing scalped soil to the weather and monitoring its degradation and settlement. The results of these tests were used as input into a predictive tool for estimating the net bulking of coal mine <b>spoil.</b> This paper focuses on the laboratory testing program of two <b>spoil</b> types, representing the range from uncemented to cemented coal mine <b>spoil,</b> and presents an estimate of their net bulking based on the predictive tool...|$|R
40|$|In open-cut strip mining, waste {{material}} is placed in-pit to minimise operational mine costs.
