5|$|The urban {{morphology}} of Skopje {{was deeply}} {{impacted by the}} 26th of July 1963 earthquake which destroyed 80% {{of the city and}} by the reconstruction that followed.

5|$|This {{class of}} {{objections}} is more radical than the above, claiming {{that a major}} aspect of evolution is not merely unscientific or implausible, but rather impossible, because it contradicts some other law of nature or is constrained in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> it cannot produce the biological diversity of the world.|$|E

5|$|Both non-selective {{glucocorticoids}} {{and selective}} glucocorticoid receptor agonists work by binding to and activating the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). In contrast to glucocorticoids, which activate the GR {{to work through}} (at least) two signal transduction pathways, SEGRAMs activate the GR in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> it only operates {{through one of the}} two main possible pathways.|$|E
5|$|In VLSI {{integrated}} circuit design, if {{a collection of}} modules must be connected by wires that can each bend at most once, then again there are two possible routes for the wires, {{and the problem of}} choosing which of these two routes to use, in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> all wires can be routed in a single layer of the circuit, can be solved as a 2-satisfiability instance.|$|E
5|$|In particular, the {{emotional}} {{part of the}} collective consciousness overrides our egoism: as we are emotionally bound to culture, we act socially because we recognize it is the responsible, moral way to act. A key to forming society is social interaction, and Durkheim believes that human beings, when in a group, will inevitably act in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> a society is formed.|$|E

5|$|Just like glucocorticoids, SEGRAMs bind to and {{activate}} GR. However, {{in contrast}} to glucocorticoids, SEGRAMs selectively activate the GR in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> they yield an improved therapeutic benefit. Generally, for specific inflammation-based diseases, SEGRAMs should more strongly transrepress than transactivate, or better yet solely transrepress and fail to transactivate. This type of selective GR activation should result in fewer side effects than the expected side effects that appear with a chronic treatment with classic glucocorticoids.|$|E

5|$|The amendment's {{first section}} {{includes}} several clauses: the Citizenship Clause, Privileges or Immunities Clause, Due Process Clause, and Equal Protection Clause. The Citizenship Clause provides a broad definition of citizenship, nullifying the Supreme Court's decision in Dred Scott v.

30|$|Clustering {{algorithm}} groups set of pixels in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> pixels in <b>a</b> {{group are}} {{more similar to}} each other than the pixel in other groups. Lee and Chen (2014) presented an approach based on fuzzy c-mean clustering (FCM) by using type- 2 fuzzy set algorithm (Zadeh 1975). They also utilized the 3 D color constancy algorithm to minimize the affects of skin tone variations and shadows in images at pre-processing stage. In another approach, fuzzy c-mean clustering and density based clustering (DBSCAN) is utilized for the segmentation of lesion from background skin on mobile platforms (Mendi et al. 2014).|$|R

5|$|To combine glyphs, rongorongo employs {{consistent}} rules. First, the ‘defining feature’ of a glyph is identified, and {{the rest}} is discarded. Then, this ‘defining feature’ is grafted onto a ‘main body’ glyph which retains most of its original shape (except for the addition of the ‘defining feature’). This is done in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> aesthetic unity is maintained. Typically, either one or two ‘defining features’ may be grafted onto a single ‘main body’.|$|E
