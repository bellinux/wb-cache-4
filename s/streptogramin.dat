50|$|By themselves, streptogramins A and B are bacteriostatic. However, {{when used}} in {{conjunction}} with one another, the streptogramins can inhibit bacterial growth and are bactericidal. <b>Streptogramin</b> A first binds to the peptidyl transferase domain of the 50s ribosomal subunit, preventing the early events of elongation. The binding of <b>streptogramin</b> A causes a conformational change that increases the ribosomal binding activity of <b>streptogramin</b> B 100-fold. Upon binding the ribosome (which <b>streptogramin</b> B can accomplish at any stage of protein synthesis), <b>streptogramin</b> B prevents protein chain extension and can initiate the release of incomplete peptides. When both streptogramins are bound to the ribosome, they form an extremely stable ternary complex.|$|E
50|$|Streptogramins A and B synergically inhibit cell {{growth of}} gram positive, less so gram {{negative}} bacteria by inhibiting protein synthesis, but separately they are bacteriostatic. The molecular target of streptogramins is the 23S rRNA. Both <b>streptogramin</b> A and B bind to the P binding {{site of the}} 50S ribosome subunit. The type A <b>streptogramin</b> binding causes a conformational change to the 50S subunit, which increases {{the activity of the}} type B <b>streptogramin</b> by a 100-fold. <b>Streptogramin</b> B prevents the elongation of protein chains and causes the release of incomplete peptides.|$|E
50|$|<b>Streptogramin</b> A is a polyketide in nature, but {{contains}} some amino acid components as well. Its gene cluster codes for a hybrid PKS-NRPS protein {{that consists of}} eight PKS modules and two NRPS modules. Other enzymes are required for tailoring of <b>streptogramin</b> A, particularly for the unusual methylation reaction. The figure below shows {{the origins of the}} synthetic components of <b>streptogramin</b> A.|$|E
40|$|Protein {{synthesis}} is catalysed by ribosomes and cytoplasmic factors. Bacterial ribosomes (70 S) {{are made}} up of 2 subunits (50 S and 30 S) containing ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and ribosomal proteins: the 30 S binds messenger RNA and begins the ribosomal cycle (initiation), whereas 50 S binds transfer RNA (tRNA) derivatives and controls elongation. The key reaction, peptide bond formation, is promoted by the catalytic centre of 50 S (the peptidyl transferase centre), and the growing peptide chain (peptidyl-tRNA) attached at the donor P site undergoes peptide linkage with an aminoacyl-tRNA at the acceptor A site. This reaction is inhibited by several antibiotics, the best known being chloramphenicol, and the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS) group. These inhibitors have a reversible action, except for <b>streptogramins</b> that are composed of A and B components, which are bacteriostatic alone, but bactericidal when combined. The peptidyl transferase centre has been identified at the 50 S surface, and the binding sites of inhibitors have been mapped within this domain: some of these sites overlap (e. g. those of macrolides, and type B <b>streptogramins,</b> which compete for binding to ribosomes). Chloramphenicol blocks the catalytic portion, and A <b>streptogramins</b> the substrate sites of the peptidyl transferase centre. Macrolides and type B <b>streptogramins</b> interfere with the formation of long polypeptides and cause a premature detachment of incomplete peptide chains. The synergism between types A and B <b>streptogramins</b> is due to induction by type A <b>streptogramins</b> of an increased ribosome affinity for type B <b>streptogramins.</b> Microbial resistance to antibiotics mainly involves inactivation of inhibitors and modification of targets (mutations of ribosomal proteins or rRNA genes). Alterations of rRNA bases can induce resistance to a single inhibitor or to a group of antibiotics (e. g. MLSB). The impact of resistance in chemotherapy is less important for <b>streptogramins</b> than for other inhibitors, because the synergistic effect of A and B <b>streptogramins</b> also applies to strains resistant to the MLSB group. It is proposed that mutations and modifications of rRNA bases induce conformational ribosomal changes that prevent antibiotics binding to the target. Conformational changes are also triggered by type A streptogramins: they are responsible for their synergism with type B <b>streptogramins...</b>|$|R

Resistance was mainly due to the presence of ermA or ermC genes, which were detected in 259 strains (88 %), in particular those resistant to methicillin (78 % of the strains). Macrolide resistance due to msrA was more prevalent in coagulase-negative staphylococci (14. 6 %) than in S. aureus (2. 1 %). Genes related to linA/linA′ and conferring resistance to lincomycin were detected in one strain of S. aureus and seven strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci.

40|$|SummaryStreptogramin {{antibiotics}} {{are comprised}} of two distinct chemical components: the type A polyketides {{and the type}} B cyclic depsipeptides.

50|$|<b>Streptogramin</b> A is {{group of}} {{antibiotics}} {{within the larger}} family of antibiotics known as streptogramins. They are synthesized by the bacteria Streptomyces virginiae.

While structurally different, these two groups of antibiotics act synergistically, providing greater antibiotic activity than the combined activity of the separate components.
