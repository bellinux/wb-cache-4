50|$|A study {{conducted}} by four <b>sociology</b> <b>professors</b> found that individuals who typify criminals as disproportionately Hispanic are more supportive of punitive crime control policies. This means that those who associate Hispanics and Latinos with violent crimes and other injustices {{are more likely to}} support disciplinary crime control policies. This stems from the negative stereotypes associated with Hispanics, making them out to be more violent and likely to commit crimes. In effect, this singles out Hispanics and Latinos, grouping millions of individuals into one category.|$|R
50|$|Hunt had {{difficulty}} deciding on an undergraduate major, {{so he started}} with biology, and then moved to philosophy, economics, and sociology.

These professors:“…suggest that theater, more generally, provides structure for cruel performance, and that violent land conflict, together with forest destruction, constitutes a predictable tragedy of theatrical events. In other words, violent land conflict in Amazonia, with all its terrible implication for people and environment, can be grasped as a theatrical structure with philosophic and material consequences for mind and body.” ...|$|R

25|$|In the United States two photographers got {{involved}} {{at the end}} of the 19th century in favor of people on the margins of society, Jacob Riis and Lewis Hine. For them the camera was an instrument of accusation against social injustice. In 1890 Riis documented the living conditions of the unemployed and homeless in New York ("How the Other Half Lives"). He was also interested in the fate of immigrants, many of whom lived in extreme poverty in the New York slums. Riis clearly takes sides for the people he photographed and appeals to the social conscience of society. In 1908 the National Child Labor Committee hired Hine, a <b>sociology</b> <b>professor</b> who advocated photography as an educational medium, to document child labor in American industry. In the early 20th century Hine would publish thousands of photographs designed to pull at the nation's heartstrings. Child Labor was widespread in the U.S. in the early 20th century. Hine equally drew attention to the situation of immigrants. The work of Riis and Hine had political influence. Riis' commitment to the people in the Mulberry Bend neighborhood led to its demolition. The building of schools and educational programs can also be attributed to Riis. Hine's work culminated in a law against child labor, the Keating-Owen Act of 1916, which was repealed shortly after the entry of the U.S. into the First World War.|$|E

Pilgrim explains how the exaggerated features serve their discriminatory purpose by emphasizing the differences of the depicted race, thereby reinforcing the idea that the caricaturized race is inferior.|$|E

Veronica tells Sheriff Lamb (Michael Muhney) that she ran into the room and heard Parker having sex, and Parker berates her for not checking to see what was happening. Keith (Enrico Colantoni) hikes through the desert after fleeing from Cormac Fitzpatrick (Jason Beghe); Cormac later realizes that Keith has disappeared and starts following him. Wallace (Percy Daggs III) and Logan's (Jason Dohring) <b>sociology</b> <b>professor</b> recruits volunteers for a Stanford prison experiment-like study. Veronica interviews for a photography position at the college newspaper, but the editor tasks her with writing an exposé of the Theta Beta sorority, where Parker was during the night of her rape. Parker’s parents appear at Hearst and announce {{that they are going to}} remove her from the college in light of her assault. During her investigation, Veronica poses as a potential recruit, {{but she does not}} note any suspicious activity. In the sociology experiment, Logan is assigned to the role of a prisoner, while Wallace acts as a [...] "guard". While tracking Keith, Cormac gets stuck in a bear trap; his brother Liam (Rod Rowland) appears and shoots him. Veronica is invited to attend a [...] "private party", which she believes will be the key to her exposé. At the party, Veronica encounters Dick (Ryan Hansen) and learns that Parker's room was easily accessible. Veronica pretends to be drunk in order to ascertain whether or not the sorority members collaborate with the rapist, but they just drive her home.|$|E
500|$|Parody and satire of est and The Forum in {{television}} {{has taken a}} more direct approach than in literature and film.

[...] In the episode, David Letterman portrayed an Erhard-like character {{by the name of}} [...] "Ellsworth" [...] offering ERK or Ellsworth Revitalization Konditioning. [...] In a 1982 article in the journal Theory & Society, Lewis & Clark College <b>sociology</b> <b>professor</b> Robert Goldman compared and contrasted Letterman's [...] "Ellsworth" [...] character and his training program to that of Werner Erhard. [...] Goldman noted that the episode spent time: [...] "lampooning Werner Erhard and est-like commercial pop psychologies." [...] However, Goldman went on to note that the inherent problem with [...] "Ellsworth Revitalization Konditioning" [...] was not the training - but Ellsworth himself. [...] Ellsworth is seen not just as a parody of Werner Erhard, but also of consumerism: [...] "As the self-help entrepreneur, Ellsworth is portrayed as a walking collection of lifestyle-status points and sign-values ("I've got my Rolls-Royce!"). Conspicuous consumption and commodity fetishism define his personality." [...] Goldman explained that the Mork and Mindy episode succeeded in distinguishing between criticism of the Ellsworth training, and criticism of Ellsworth, citing Ellsworth's character traits of: [...] "tyranny, selfishness, open greed, and flaunting of the accoutrements of his vulgar money-making." [...] In the end of the segment of the episode parodying est, Mork wins out over the Ellsworth philosophy by instead calling to mind universal humanistic moral values. [...] David Letterman received positive praise for his portrayal of [...] "Ellsworth" [...] in the episode.|$|E
