25|$|Product {{and process}} design can be largely {{improved}} using modern modeling, simulation and optimization techniques. The key question in optimal design {{is the measure}} of what is good or desirable about a design. Before looking for optimal designs {{it is important to}} identify characteristics which contribute the most to the overall value of the design. A good design typically involves multiple criteria/objectives such as capital cost/investment, operating cost, profit, quality and/or recovery of the product, efficiency, process <b>safety,</b> <b>operation</b> time etc. Therefore, in practical applications, the performance of process and product design is often measured with respect to multiple objectives. These objectives typically are conflicting, i.e. achieving the optimal value for one objective requires some compromise on one or more of other objectives.|$|E

50|$|Machine tool {{monitoring}} {{is explained}} with Acoustic Emission (AE) Sensors. AE Sensor is commonly {{defined as the}} sound emitted as an elastic wave by a solid when it is deformed or struck, caused by the rapid release of localized stress energy. Therefore, it is an occurrence phenomenon which releases elastic energy into the material, which then propagates as an elastic wave. The detection frequency range of acoustic emission is from 1 kHz to 1 MHz. Rapid stress-releasing events generate a spectrum of stress waves starting at 0 Hz and typically falling off at several MHz. AE {{can be related to}} an irreversible release of energy. It can also be generated from sources not involving material failure including friction, cavitation and impact. The three major applications of AE sensors phenomena are: a) Source location - determine the locations of occurrence of an event b) Material mechanical performance - evaluate and characterize materials/structures; and c Health monitoring - monitors the <b>safety</b> <b>operation.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{proposes a}} novel fault {{tolerant}} control with torque limitation {{based on the}} fault mode for the ten-phase permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) under various open-circuit and short-circuit fault conditions, which includes the optimal torque control and the torque limitation control based on the fault mode. The optimal torque control is adopted to guarantee the ripple-free electromagnetic torque operation for the ten-phase motor system under the post-fault condition. Furthermore, we systematically analyze the load capacity of the ten-phase motor system under different fault modes. And a torque limitation control approach based on the fault mode is proposed, which was not available earlier. This approach is able to ensure the <b>safety</b> <b>operation</b> of the faulted motor system in long operating time without causing the overheat fault. The simulation result confirms that the proposed fault tolerant control for the ten-phase motor system is able to guarantee the ripple-free electromagnetic torque and the <b>safety</b> <b>operation</b> in long operating time under the normal and fault conditions...|$|E
