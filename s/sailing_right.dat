About 6pm, Commodore Jones ordered Pallas to ride directly in his wake, to confuse the opposition about the squadron’s strength, and {{half an hour later}} he hoisted signals ordering all vessels to form a single-file line of battle, to make best use of their broadsides as they passed the two British ships. Captain Landais, who unlike Jones {{had a great deal of}} formal training in naval leadership and tactics (and was aware of the latest French battle plans, used with considerable success against the Royal Navy at this time), decided to try a different plan. He used Alliance’s superior handling to sail off to one side, against the wind. In order to prevent him from <b>sailing</b> <b>right</b> past and chasing the convoy, Captain Thomas Piercy of the Countess of Scarborough had to do the same, leaving Serapis alone against the remaining three American ships. Finally, a little after 7pm, Bonhomme Richard was within pistol-shot of the battle-ready Serapis. In the gathering dark, Pearson then hailed the potentially hostile ship to ask some pertinent questions: its name, its nationality etc. The answer was a few evasive remarks, followed by a shot (as he recalled it, but possibly a broadside) which Serapis answered with a broadside. A minute or two later, as soon as he was within range, Landais fired his own broadside at the Countess of Scarborough (theoretically just over [...] of shot from 18 guns). Piercy soon replied (his maximum broadside being about 60lb from 10 guns).|$|E

60|$|For a {{few moments}} or an hour--no one will ever know how long--we ran round him, raising the dust, {{scattering}} the stones, breaking the branches, dodging his onslaughts. He leaped at us to {{the full length of}} his tether, <b>sailing</b> <b>right</b> into our faces, a fierce, uncowed, tigerish beast. If it had not been for the collar and swivel he would have choked himself a hundred times. Quick as a cat, supple, powerful, tireless, he kept on the go, whirling, bounding, leaping, rolling, till it seemed we would never catch him.|$|E

She threw on the body of her dress; and, her long yellow hair--which she had in default of better means been trying to comb out with a bit of wood--streaming behind her, she took the child by the hand, and flew as fast as she could go down the little rocky {{promontory}} off which Bill and Johnnie had met their end. Before she got half-way down it, she saw that the child's tale was true--for there, <b>sailing</b> <b>right</b> up the fjord from the open sea, was a large vessel. She was not two hundred yards from where she stood, and her canvas was being rapidly furled preparatory to the anchor being dropped.|$|E

And at that sight {{there was not a}} man but was on deck at once, and not a mouth but was giving its opinion of what should be done. Some were for <b>sailing</b> <b>right</b> into the roadstead, the breeze blowing fresh toward the shore (as it usually does throughout those islands in the afternoon). However, seeing the billows break here and there off the bay's mouth, they thought it better, for fear of rocks, to run by quietly, and then send in the pinnace and the boat. Yeo would have had them show Spanish colors, for fear of alarming the caravel; but Amyas stoutly refused, [...] "counting it," [...] he said, [...] "a mean thing to tell a lie in that way, unless in extreme danger, or for great ends of state." ...|$|E

50|$|Roberts' {{plan called}} for him to sail {{directly}} for the Swallow in order to quickly pass her and then escape. By doing this the Swallow would have to turn about to engage or chase the Royal Fortune which would give Roberts valuable time to flee. The plan however had one default, by <b>sailing</b> <b>right</b> past the British frigate, the Royal Fortune would be exposed to one of Swallows deadly broadsides. Captain Roberts set out for his escape and issued the command for Little Ranger and the merchantman to leave. The following action ended badly for the pirates. When Royal Fortune was off Swallows beam, the British released a massive broadside which raked the ship. The pirates opened fire and then an additional broadside from the Swallow raked the deck where Black Bart was commanding. The pirates got clear and ran ahead of the wind, leaving the 'Swallow' behind. The action took place during a fierce tropical storm, {{and just as the}} 'Royal Fortune' seemed to have escaped the ship hit the 'eye' of the storm, and were suddenly becalmed for half an hour. This gave the unaffected 'Swallow' time to catch up, and when they were in range, they fired their swivels (guns mounted on the bow which fired grape shot) at the 'Royal Fortune'. Three men died, one of them being Bartholomew Roberts. A piece of shot no bigger than a penny, hit him in the throat, severed his spinal column, and he died instantly. He settled down onto a gun, to initial observers that he was taking a rest but when the smoke had cleared away Black Bart was dead and Captain Ogle later allowed his crew to bury him at sea, which they did in all his finery, including a diamond studded six inch cross on a chain which he wore around his neck.|$|E
50|$|The Patriots {{opened the}} game with a 14 play, 80-yard drive, {{converting}} three third-downs and taking eight-and-a-half minutes off the clock, scoring on a one-yard touchdown pass to Chandler. The Giants needed just 0:51 seconds to score. After a 4-yard run by Rashad Jennings, Eli Manning hit Odell Beckham Jr. on 87-yard catch-and-run for a touchdown. After both teams went three-and-out, the Patriots drove {{all the way to the}} Giants 8, but on 3rd-and-4 Brady was sacked by Craig Dahl for a 5-yard loss and Gostkowski gave the Patriots the lead with a 31-yard field goal. On the ensuing drive, the Giants drove all the way to the Patriots 16, but Manning was strip-sacked by Chandler Jones with Justin Coleman recovering at the Patriots 16. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Giants drove all the way to the Patriots 11, but settled for a 29-yard field goal by Josh Brown, tying the game 10-10. After a Patriots punt, the Giants engineered a 7 play, 74-yard drive, scoring on a 1-yard touchdown pass to Dwayne Harris, giving the Giants a 17-10 lead with 0:13 left in the half. Brady took a knee and the game went to halftime. The Giants took the opening kick of the second half and marched 60 yards to the Patriots 20 and Brown extended the Giants lead to 20-10 on a 38-yard field goal. Later, after forcing the Giant to a three-and-out, Amendola returned the punt 82 yards to the Giants 7. Three plays later, scoring on a 1-yard touchdown run by Blount, trimming the deficit to 20-17. The Giants countered, driving all the way to the Patriots 35 with Brown draining a 53-yard field goal increasing the lead to 23-17. On the first play of the fourth quarter, Brady was strip-sacked by Jasper Brinkley with Markus Kuhn returning it 8 yards to the Patriots 31. Ninkovich sacked Manning for a 13-yard loss on the first play and the Patriots forced the Giants to a three-and-out. Starting at their own 14, two completions moved the Patriots to the 24. On the next play, Brady hit Gronk on a 76-yard catch-and-run for a touchdown, giving the Patriots a 24-23 lead. After a Giants three-and-out, facing a 3rd-and-4, Brady hit LaFell on a 54-yard bomb to the Giants 15. Four plays later, Blount scored on a 1-yard touchdown run, but the play was nullified by a holding penalty on David Andrews. Three plays later, Brady was intercepted at the Giants 1 by Trumaine McBride who returned it 2 yards to the 3. The Giants drove to the Patriots 5 and Manning hit Beckham for the go-ahead touchdown, but after official review, it was ruled that he stepped out of bounds before becoming a runner, and it was ruled an incomplete pass. After an incomplete pass, Manning was sacked for a 6-yard loss. Brown kicked a 29-yard field goal, giving the Giants a 26-24 lead with 1:47 remaining in the game. On the very first play, Brady was seemingly intercepted by Landon Collins on a deep pass attempt for Aaron Dobson, but Collins didnt maintain control and it was ruled an incomplete. After two straight incomplete passes, Brady hit Amendola for a 12-yard gain on 4th-and-10. The Patriots drove to the Giants 36, and Gostkowski made the 54-yard field goal after the kick seemed to be <b>sailing</b> <b>right,</b> giving the Patriots a 27-26 lead with :01 left. The Giants tried a lateral on the ensuing kick, but Beckham was knocked out of bounds at the Giants 11 and the Patriots escaped, keeping their undefeated season alive. With the win, the Patriots improved to 9-0 for the first time since their undefeated regular season of 2007, and snapped their three-game losing streak against the Giants. With a Bengals loss to the Texans the same week, the Patriots remain the only undefeated team in the AFC.|$|E
