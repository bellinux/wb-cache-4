50|$|Norman de Bruyne had a meeting, on 9 April 1936, with de Havilland {{aircraft}} {{and received a}} cheque for £1000 and a consultancy to research into reinforced phenolformaldehyde resins for use in propeller manufacture. This decision by De Havilland Propellers division {{turned out to be}} one of considerable importance as it led directly to the acceptance and use of <b>structural</b> <b>adhesive</b> bonding in many, if not all, aircraft from the mid-1940s to the present day.|$|E
50|$|The {{aerospace}} industry manufactures {{small numbers of}} very expensive products and is thus able to afford the high capital and unit operating costs of autoclaves. Typically, this entails applying carefully controlled levels of heat and pressure to parts and assemblies. The curing of composites requires compacting the piles of material, pressing this material against the mold, forcing out volatiles and excess resin, and holding everything motionless during the entire cure cycle. In <b>structural</b> <b>adhesive</b> bonding, the autoclave forces the parts together and holds them while the adhesive cures. Unlike a press, the autoclave applies pressure uniformly, irrespective of {{the shape of the}} workload.|$|E

50|$|The {{first use}} of {{honeycomb}} structures for structural applications had been independently proposed for building application and published already in 1914. In 1934 Edward G. Budd patented a welded steel honeycomb sandwich panel from corrugated metal sheets and Claude Dornier aimed 1937 to solve the core-skin bonding problem by rolling or pressing a skin which is in a plastic state into the core cell walls. The first successful <b>structural</b> <b>adhesive</b> bonding of honeycomb sandwich structures was achieved by Norman de Bruyne of Aero Research Limited, who patented an adhesive with the right viscosity to form resin fillets on the honeycomb core in 1938. The North American XB-70 Valkyrie made extensive use of stainless steel honeycomb panels using a brazing process they developed.|$|E

30|$|Nowadays, <b>structural</b> <b>adhesives</b> are {{increasingly}} being used for new applications, replacing conventional bonding methods. Epoxy resins {{are the most common}} <b>structural</b> <b>adhesives</b> used due to their suitable mechanical, thermal and chemical properties, despite their low ductility. In the past decades, several researchers have found it crucial to reverse these properties and find new ways to increase the ductility of these adhesives. The inclusion of particles (nano or micro) is an effective method to improve ductility of <b>structural</b> <b>adhesives.</b> In the present study, natural micro particles of cork are used with the objective of increasing the ductility of a brittle epoxy adhesive. The concept is for the cork particles to act like as a crack stopper leading to more energy absorption. The influence of the cork particle size, amount and the presence of a surface treatment were studied. The maximum strain of the adhesive was assessed through tensile tests. A Taguchi design experiments was used to understand the influence of each parameter under study (amount, size and presence of surface treatment) and their interaction. Through this research it was possible to settle that cork can improve ductility and cork amount, size and the use of plasma surface treatment have influence on the mechanical properties.|$|R

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the {{development}} of design rules for <b>structural</b> <b>adhesive</b> bonded joints. In daily practice engineers are confronted with the problem to verify the reliability of their designs. This can be done with use of an experimental programme, but for the marine, transport, building and civil engineering sectors this will not be an option, because it is too expensive and time consuming. The use of design rules might be an alternative, but current guidelines for <b>structural</b> <b>adhesive</b> bonded joints do not guarantee the reliability. To develop design rules that meet the required level of reliability, new approaches have to be used. Such a systematic approach is presented in this article. It is based on the current <b>structural</b> <b>adhesive</b> bonding technology and on structural reliability methods. Partial factors are used to take the required reliability level into account. Additional conversion factors are introduced to cover the effects of ageing. Methods are discussed how to calibrate these factors.

40|$|The {{study of}} <b>structural</b> <b>adhesive</b> {{connections}} between glass and metals {{belongs to a}} relatively juvenile field of research in building construction. Mechanical tests to assess the structural performance of such connections and to comprehend the behaviour of the adhesive joint under loading are therefore essential. One of the difficulties encountered during mechanical tests is the practical inability of traditional measuring techniques, such as strain gauges, to determine the strain distribution in the adhesive layer. Strains, from which stresses can be calculated, are of fundamental importance as the design of <b>structural</b> <b>adhesive</b> glass-metal connections is based on cohesive failure of the adhesive layer. For that reason, Digital Image Correlation (DIC) could be an innovative and reliable alternative to measure full-field strain in the adhesive layer during mechanical testing. In this research, the application possibilities and limits of DIC are investigated to characterise strains in the cross-section of the adhesive layer of linear adhesive cold-formed steel-glass connections during experimental tests. This paper reports on the possibilities and pitfalls of this measurement technique for the considered application and deals with practicalities and points of interest. DIC-results obtained during experimental tests, referred to as case studies, are presented as well. From these case studies, the conclusion was drawn that in <b>structural</b> <b>adhesive</b> glass-metal connection testing for practical applications or design purposes, digital image correlation is highly complementary to conventional strain measurement techniques...|$|E
