40|$|We {{present the}} results of lattice QCD {{calculations}} of the magnetic moments of the lightest nuclei, the deuteron, the triton, and [superscript 3]He, {{along with those of}} the neutron and proton. These calculations, performed at quark masses corresponding to m[subscript π] ~ 800 [*][*]MeV, reveal that the structure of these nuclei at unphysically heavy quark masses closely resembles that at the physical quark masses. In particular, we find that the magnetic moment of [superscript 3]He differs only slightly from that of a free neutron, {{as is the case in}} nature, indicating that the shell-model configuration of two spin-paired protons and a valence neutron captures its dominant structure. Similarly a shell-model-like moment is found for the triton, μ 3 [subscript H] ~ μ[subscript p]. The deuteron magnetic moment is found to be equal to the nucleon isoscalar moment within the uncertainties of the calculations. Furthermore, deviations from the <b>Schmidt</b> <b>limits</b> are also found to be similar to those in nature for these nuclei. These findings suggest that at least some nuclei at these unphysical quark masses are describable by a phenomenological nuclear shell model. United States.

25|$|In 1964, <b>Schmidt</b> was <b>limited</b> to nine games. His {{season ended}} on November 9 when he {{sustained}} yet another dislocated shoulder {{in a loss}} to the Packers. After sustaining the injury, Schmidt announced {{that he intended to}} retire as a player. However, he quickly rescinded his resignation and stated his intent to attempt a comeback in 1965.|$|R
40|$|Recent on-line nuclear {{orientation}} measurements of nuclear magnetic dipole moments by {{the method of}} NMR on oriented nuclei (NMR/ON) have yielded significant new odd-A moments. These include those closest to double magic 132 Sn, namely, 133 Sb [132 Sn plus one g 7 / 2 + proton] and 133 Tem [132 Sn {{with a pair of}} g 7 / 2 + protons and one hole in the h 11 / 2 - neutron sub-shell]. These close-to-double-magic results allow stringent tests of nuclear moment theory including, as main contributions to deviations from the simple free nucleon (<b>Schmidt</b> <b>limit)</b> values, configuration mixing in the nuclear wavefunction and mesonic exchange current modification to the dipole moment operator. Comparison with theoretical prediction, using established approaches to both these corrections, is discussed showing success in medium mass nuclei comparable to results previously established in light [to 40 Ca] and heavy [near 208 Pb] nuclei...|$|R
40|$|The nucleus 49 Sc, {{having a}} single f(7 / 2) proton outside doubly magic 48 Ca (Z= 20, N= 28), {{is one of}} the very few {{isotopes}} which makes possible testing of the fundamental theory of nuclear magnetism. The magnetic moment has been measured by online β NMR of nuclei oriented at milli-Kelvin temperatures to be (+) 5. 616 (25) [*][*]μ(N). The result is discussed in terms of a detailed theory of the structure of the magnetic moment operator, showing excellent agreement with calculated departure from the f(7 / 2) <b>Schmidt</b> <b>limit</b> extreme single-particle value. The measurement completes the sequence of moments of Sc isotopes with even numbers of f(7 / 2) neutrons: the first such isotopic chain between two major shells for which a full set of moment measurements exists. The result further completes the isotonic sequence of ground-state moments of nuclei with an odd number of f(7 / 2) protons coupled to a closed subshell of f(7 / 2) neutrons. Comparison with a recent shell-model calculation of the latter sequence is made...|$|R
500|$|Generals Kurt Student and <b>Schmidt</b> desired a <b>limited</b> {{air attack}} to {{temporarily}} paralyse the defences, allowing the tanks {{to break out}} of the bridgehead; severe urban destruction was to be avoided as it would only hamper their advance. However, Luftwaffe commander Hermann Göring, worried about the fate of his surrounded airborne troops, hoped to force an immediate Dutch national capitulation by a much more extensive bombardment. His head of operations, General Otto Hoffmann von Waldau, described this option as a [...] "radical solution" [...] (Radikallösung). Despite misgivings by Albert Kesselring about its scope and necessity, at 11:45 ninety Heinkels took off for a carpet bombing of the inner city of Rotterdam.|$|R
40|$|Online Digital Sky Survey (DSS) {{material}} {{is often used}} to obtain information on newly discovered variable stars for older epochs (e. g. Nova progenitors, flare stars, [...] .). We present here the results of an investigation of photometry on online digital sky survey material in small fields calibrated by CCD sequences. We compared different source extraction mechanisms and found, that even down near to the sensitivity limit, despite the H-compression used for the online material, photometry with an accuracy better than 01 rms is possible on DSS-II. Our investigation shows that the accuracy depends strongly on the source extraction method. The SuperCOSMOS scans, although retrieved with an higher spatial resolution, do not give us better results. The methods and parameters presented here, allow the user to obtain good plate photometry in small fields down to the <b>Schmidt</b> plate survey <b>limits</b> with a few bright CCD calibrators, which may be calibrated with amateur size telescopes. Especially for the events mentioned above, new field photometry for calibration purposes mostly exists, but the progenitors were not measured photometrically before. Also the follow up whether stellar concentrations are newly detected clusters or similar work may be done without using mid size telescopes. The calibration presented here is a "local" one for small fields. We show that this method presented here gives higher accuracies than "global" calibrations of surveys (e. g. GSC-II, SuperCOSMOS and USNO-B) Comment: 8 pages, 12 figures, accepted in MNRA...|$|R
