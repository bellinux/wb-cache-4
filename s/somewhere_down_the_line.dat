500|$|On {{a special}} episode of Raw dubbed Thursday Raw Thursday, Michaels vacated the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. He {{explained}} to fans {{that he was}} informed by doctors that he had conjured a knee injury {{and that he had}} to retire. His speech was regarded as controversial, as Michaels was allegedly unwilling to lose to Bret Hart at WrestleMania 13 (since it was noted {{that he was going to}} have a rematch with Hart at WrestleMania). Michaels contemplated thoughts of retirement and stated that he [...] "had to find his smile again", which he had [...] "lost" [...] <b>somewhere</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> After knee surgery by Dr. James Andrews, Michaels returned a few months later, briefly teaming with Stone Cold Steve Austin to win the WWF Tag Team Championship. In his autobiography, Michaels reveals about his real-life feud with Bret Hart, claiming that Hart did interviews on live television claiming that he [...] was faking his whole injury.|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{of these}} surviving versions in Middle English is Ipomadon and {{occurs in the}} manuscript Chetham 8009 (Manchester), which contains a unique copy of an 8,891-line tail-rhyme romance, dating in composition to [...] "anywhere between {{the last decade of}} the fourteenth century and the middle of the fifteenth century" [...] This version of the tale follows Hue de Rotelande's story quite closely, although abridging it somewhat by cutting battle details and most of Hue's rather coarse or prosaic narrative intrusions. Composed in a dialect that suggests that it was originally written by a West Yorkshireman in his native West Yorkshire, in the north of England, the manuscript copy itself dates to the late-fifteenth century, is from a London Scriptorium and contains clues that the work from which this copy was taken had itself been re-copied, <b>somewhere</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> in the southwest of England.|$|E

5000|$|In September 2010, Bradley Walsh {{revealed}} that he may reprise his role as Danny Baldwin on Coronation Street in the future. Walsh told Holy Soap: [...] "If {{the time was right}} for them and Danny Baldwin needs to go back, and the time is right for me where I've actually got some time to do it. Because you can't just go in and do one, two or three weeks - you have to really put your mind to it. The scripts come four months in advance, so the timing has to be absolutely right. It's a bit like the alignment of the moon and the stars to get it right. So if that came about <b>somewhere</b> later <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> I would love to go back, of course. It was a fantastic show and a great character." ...|$|R

2500|$|The main feud {{heading into}} In Your House 13 was between Bret Hart, Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Undertaker, and Vader over the finish of the Royal Rumble. As per stipulation, {{the winner of}} the Rumble match would face the WWF Champion for his title at WrestleMania 13. At the Royal Rumble event, Shawn Michaels won the title from Sycho Sid in the main event {{following}} the Rumble match and avenged the loss he suffered at the hands of Sid at Survivor Series the previous November. According to Bret Hart, Michaels was scheduled to drop the title to him at WrestleMania in return for Hart having dropped the title to Michaels at the same event one year earlier. Michaels later suffered a legitimate knee injury during a three-way match with Sid and Bret Hart two weeks after the Royal Rumble, and on the February 13, 1997 edition of Raw, known as Thursday Raw Thursday, Michaels vacated the title by speaking to the fans, telling them that he was told by doctors that he suffered a very bad knee injury and that he should at least consider retirement. He stated that he [...] "had to find his smile again", which he had [...] "lost" [...] <b>somewhere</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> Michaels spent time rehabbing his knee at the same time Steve Austin was rehabbing his knee injury at HealthSouth in San Antonio. This did not sit well with Hart, who had legitimate backstage problems with Michaels at this time and who also thought Michaels' injury was not as severe as he was claiming it to be.|$|E
