60|$|Yet on {{the other}} hand it is certain that {{mathematics}} generally, and particularly geometry, owes its existence to the need which was felt of learning something about the relations of real things to one another. The very word geometry, which, of course, means earth-measuring, proves this. For earth-measuring {{has to do with the}} possibilities of the disposition of certain natural objects with respect to one another, namely, with parts of the earth, measuring-lines, measuring-wands, etc. It is clear that the <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>concepts</b> of axiomatic geometry alone cannot make any assertions as to the relations of real objects of this kind, which we will call practically-rigid bodies. To be able to make such assertions, geometry must be stripped of its merely logical-formal character by the co-ordination of real objects of experience with the empty conceptual frame-work of axiomatic geometry. To accomplish this, we need only add the proposition:--Solid bodies are related, with respect to their possible dispositions, as are bodies in Euclidean geometry of three dimensions. Then the propositions of Euclid contain affirmations as to the relations of practically-rigid bodies.|$|E

Approaches to Legal OntologiesThis paper addresses legal classifications by comparing legal doctrine and computational ontologies. In recent years legal ontologies have attracted a growing interest, not only from knowledge engineers but also from legal scholars. Indeed, several controversial issues arise concerning the elicitation and structuring of domain (legal) knowledge, and legal theory can provide useful insights in this respect. The existing tradition of definition and classification <b>of</b> legal <b>concepts</b> by legal doctrine can provide a source for the extraction and characterisation <b>of</b> <b>concepts</b> to be included in legal ontologies. The question arises as to what extent doctrinal structures can be reused in the construction of legal ontologies, and as to what extent doctrinal analyses can draw inspiration from computational ontologies. Firstly, different theoretical approaches to legal conceptualisation are presented. Special emphasis is put on the tension existing in the law between the possibility <b>of</b> defining legal <b>concepts</b> in abstract and the need to define them in the context of each norm, which is a specially relevant issue for legal ontology building, since it concerns capturing the semantics <b>of</b> legal <b>concepts.</b> Secondly, <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>concepts</b> in legal doctrine are analysed and compared, considering both their structure as well as the kind of semantic relationships they include. Through the examination of several examples taken from a broad temporal span in the history of legal thought, it is observed that the <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> legal <b>concepts</b> in doctrine have different levels of abstraction (from very general legal categories encompassing the whole legal domain, to specialised conceptual systems representing particular domains like private law) and different structures (from is-a hierarchies to more complex functional networks <b>of</b> <b>concepts).</b> Some conclusions are drawn as to the possible mappings between doctrinal <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>concepts</b> and computational ontologies. Further lines of research are suggested to better exploit the possible cross-fertilisation between legal doctrine and ontological research in the framework of knowledge representation for intelligent legal information management...|$|R

There was a need to develop a high-level programming language, but there was a problem: the absence of an appropriate translator for better human/computer communication. L.I. Kaluzhnin, a professor at Kyiv University, who taught a course on mathematical logic in the 1950-70s, made a significant advancement in the understanding of this problem and formalized a scheme of interfacing with the program. Following this development, in 1955, Yushchenko developed the programming language, which was a language-based on two general principles for the computer work: addressing and software management. Creating a convenient <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>concepts</b> for describing the computer architecture and its system instructions, the language thus became the means of manipulation of the second-rank addresses.
