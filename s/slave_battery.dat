5|$|The {{division}} {{would use}} approximately 350 gliders for the operation, {{the majority of}} which would transport 6th Airlanding Brigade. This number included thirty-four Hamilcars; four would land in landing zone 'N' between 03:00 and 04:30 {{in support of the}} operations of 3rd Parachute Brigade and 5th Parachute Brigade, and would carry four 17-pounder anti-tank guns and their transport vehicles and crews. The other thirty would land at approximately 21:00 in landing-zone 'W' as part of a reinforcement lift. Twenty of the Hamilcars would carry Tetrarch light tanks and their crews which belonged to 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment, four more carried three Rota trailers without crews, and another three carried Universal Carriers with their crews. The last three carried two Universal Carriers converted to accommodate a 3-inch mortar, one Universal Carrier which carried a <b>slave</b> <b>battery,</b> sixteen motorcycles and a jeep. The four Hamilcars which were to land in support of 3rd and 5th Parachute Brigades took off from Tarrant Rushton at 02:10 on 6 June and were due to land at approximately 03:30; however, only two landed successfully. One suffered a broken tow rope shortly after it took off, although it was able to land safely at an airfield in England; the other reached the Normandy coast, but the tow rope was disconnected too early and it landed a considerable distance away from the landing zone. When dawn broke, it was discovered by German forces and attacked; four of the crew and passengers were killed and one captured, but the rest managed to escape.|$|E
500|$|Planes {{returning}} from the first missions were refuelled and repaired where required and made ready to tow the gliders that evening. The airlift included 226 Airspeed Horsa gliders, each piloted by two men from the Glider Pilot Regiment. With a wingspan of [...] and a length of , the Horsa had a maximum load capacity of [...] as well as space for two pilots, a maximum of twenty-eight troops or two jeeps, one jeep and an artillery gun or one jeep with a trailer. The division's heavier equipment was carried in thirty General Aircraft Hamilcar gliders. Twenty of these would carry Tetrarch light tanks and their crews belonging to 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment, four more carried three Rota trailers carrying fuel supplies without crews, another three transported, Universal Carriers with their crews. The last three carried two Universal Carriers converted to accommodate a 3-inch mortar, one Universal Carrier equipped with a <b>slave</b> <b>battery,</b> sixteen motorcycles and a jeep.|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} {{for use of}} robotic systems in remote applications arenas has long motivated development of robust and stable means of teleoperated control of slave systems. However, telerobotic systems face challenges stemming from the devices themselves, environmental factors, communication and control complexities. To address these challenges, we will adopt the passivity based synchronization framework [1] and study its applicability to safely synchronize two heterogeneous Lagrangian systems. Within this framework, an adaptive controller identifies and stabilizes {{the dynamics of the}} master and slave systems and renders the dynamics passive to a secondary coupling input. The passive mapping used to couple the output states of the master and slave systems and is made insensitive to lossy and delayed communication medium. Specifically, an adaptive passive synchronization teleoperation controller is developed between an Omni haptic device that serves as our master and a differentially driven nonholonomic Wheel Mobile Robot (WMR) as the <b>slave</b> system. A <b>battery</b> of hardware-in-the-loop simulations are used to verify the proposed controller. ...|$|R
