500|$|Agricultural {{and urban}} growth in Arizona {{eventually}} outstripped {{the capacity of}} local rivers; these concerns were reflected {{in the creation of}} a Pacific Southwest Water Plan in the 1950s, which aimed to build a project that would permit Arizona to fully utilize its [...] allotment of the river. The Pacific Southwest Water Plan was the first major proposal to divert water to the Colorado Basin from other river basins – namely, from the wetter northwestern United States. It was intended to boost supplies for the Lower Basin states of Arizona, California and Nevada as well as Mexico, thus allowing the Upper Basin states to retain native Colorado River flows for their own use. Although there was still a <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> in the Colorado Basin during the mid-20th century, the Bureau of Reclamation predicted, correctly, that eventually population growth would outstrip the available supply and require the transfer of water from other sources.|$|E

50|$|In 2300 BC, the {{waterway}} from the Nile {{to the natural}} lake was widened and deepened to make a canal which {{is now known as}} the Bahr Yussef. This project was started by Amenemhat III, or perhaps by his father Senusret III. This canal fed into the lake. This was meant to serve three purposes: control the flooding of the Nile, regulate the <b>water</b> level <b>of</b> the Nile during dry seasons, and serve the surrounding area with irrigation. There is evidence of ancient Egyptian pharaohs of the twelfth dynasty using the natural lake of Faiyum as a reservoir to store <b>surpluses</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> for use during the dry periods.|$|R

60|$|If the <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> {{upon the}} Abyssinian {{mountains}} had been constant and uniform, the stream, in its passage across the desert, would have communicated very little fertility to the barren sands which it traversed. The immediate {{banks of the}} river would have, perhaps, been fringed with verdure, but {{the influence of the}} irrigation would have extended no farther than the water itself could have reached, by percolation through the sand. But the flow of the water is not thus uniform and steady. In a certain season of the year the rains are incessant, and they descend with such abundance and profusion as almost to inundate the districts where they fall. Immense torrents stream down the mountain sides; the valleys are deluged; plains turn into morasses, and morasses into lakes. In a word, the country becomes half submerged, and the accumulated mass of waters would rush with great force and violence down the central valley of the desert, which forms their only outlet, if the passage were narrow, and if it made any considerable descent in its course to the sea. It is, however, not narrow, and the descent is very small. The depression in the surface of the desert, through which the water flows, is from five to ten miles wide, and, though it is nearly two thousand miles from the rainy district across the desert to the sea, the country for the whole distance is almost level. There is only sufficient descent, especially for the last thousand miles, to determine a very gentle current to the northward in the waters of the stream.|$|E

5000|$|Irrigation as the {{artificial}} application <b>of</b> <b>water</b> {{to the soil}} was used to some extent in Ancient Egypt, a hydraulic civilization (which entails hydraulic engineering). In crop production it is mainly used to replace missing rainfall in periods of drought, as opposed to reliance on direct rainfall (referred to as dryland farming or as rainfed farming). Before technology advanced, the people of Egypt relied on the natural flow of the Nile River to tend to the crops. Although the Nile provided sufficient watering survival domesticated animals, crops, {{and the people of}} Egypt, there were times where the Nile would flood the area wreaking havoc amongst the land. [...] There is evidence of the ancient Egyptian pharaoh Amenemhet III in the twelfth dynasty (about 1800 BCE) using the natural lake of the Fayûm as a reservoir to store <b>surpluses</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> for use during the dry seasons, as the lake swelled annually with the flooding of the Nile. Construction of drainage canals reduced the problems of major flooding from entering homes and areas of crops; but because it was a hydraulic civilization, much <b>of</b> the <b>water</b> management was controlled in a systematic way.|$|R
50|$|Perennial {{irrigation}} was {{practiced in}} the Mesopotamian plain whereby crops were regularly watered throughout the growing season by coaxing water through a matrix of small channels formed in the field. Ancient Egyptians practiced Basin irrigation using the flooding of the Nile to inundate land plots which had been surrounded by dykes. The flood water was held until the fertile sediment had settled before the surplus was returned to the watercourse. There is evidence of the ancient Egyptian pharaoh Amenemhet III in the twelfth dynasty (about 1800 BCE) using the natural lake of the Faiyum Oasis as a reservoir to store <b>surpluses</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> for use during the dry seasons. The lake swelled annually from flooding of the Nile.The Ancient Nubians developed a form of irrigation by using a waterwheel-like device called a sakia. Irrigation began in Nubia some time between the third and second millennium BCE. It largely depended upon the flood waters that would flow through the Nile River and other rivers {{in what is now}} the Sudan.|$|R

The immense waterworks undertaken by the ancient Egyptian pharaohs of the twelfth dynasty to transform the lake into a huge water reservoir gave the impression that the lake itself was an artificial excavation, as reported by classic geographers and travellers.

But, during the summers of 1928 and 1929, the area experienced a drought, once again forcing a search for new sources of water. A temporary pumping station was established on the Naßbach, near its confluence with the Preinbach, but this water had to be chlorinated.

50|$|Learning of the {{breaking}} of the truce upon his return from Rome, Silva marches the 5000 men of the 10th Legion to the foot of Masada and lays a siege to the apparently impregnable fortress. He directs Quadratus and Merovius on a suicidal assault of the fortress in order to remove them from his forces and make them an example to any others who share their political leanings. Rubrius Gallus directs that a ramp be built to almost the summit of the mountain intent on breaking through the Masada walls {{with the aid of a}} 50-foot siege tower that is being constructed out of sight of the rebels. When Eleazar successfully attacks the Roman soldiers building the ramp with catapulted stones, Silva quickly rounds up hundreds of Jews from the surrounding area to use as slaves to continue the work, believing correctly that Eleazar will not attack fellow Jews. This makes Eleazar change his tactics to psychological warfare, allowing the heat of the sun and revealing the <b>surplus</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> on Masada to demoralize the Roman troops. Also, he acts to capitalize on the Romans' belief in reading the future from the entrails of sacrificed goats, leading a party through the Roman sentries at night to feed the goats maggots, knowing that their discovery during the rituals will be seen as a bad omen. Eleazar’s problems are further compounded by his own religious doubts and opposition from the more pacifist groups on Masada.|$|E

50|$|After the {{partition}} of India in 1947 into Pakistan and India, the Indus basin was bisected with India gaining {{the upper reaches of}} the Indus river and its tributaries while Pakistan gained the lower reaches. This led to a situation in which utlisation and development <b>of</b> <b>water</b> resources in one country would hamper the same in another. While negotiations for resolving the dispute were in progress in 1954, activities had already started in India in anticipation of a treaty. Although the issue <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>of</b> Sutlej river was resolved through the Bhakra Nangal project, the issue <b>of</b> <b>surplus</b> <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> Ravi river and Beas river excluding the pre-Partition use remained. On 29 January 1955, the states of Punjab, PEPSU, Rajasthan and Jammu and Kashmir came to an agreement regarding the distribution <b>of</b> <b>water</b> from the rivers, with Punjab being allocated 5.9 MAF (million acre-feet) and PEPSU gaining 1.3 MAF out of the estimated 15.85 MAF <b>of</b> <b>water</b> while Rajasthan gained 8 MAF and Jammu and Kashmir gaining the remaining 0.65 MAF.

It is not far from there that the Paimpont Biological Station of the University of Rennes 1, built in 1966 and 1967, dominates the lake of Chatenay. The varied forest and its surroundings constitute a framework favorable to many training courses in which the Rennes 1 biology students as well as foreign researchers take part.
