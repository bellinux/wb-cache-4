40|$|Wireless Standards such as ANSI- 41 and WIN are {{dynamic in}} nature, {{continuously}} evolving to meet <b>subscriber</b> <b>requirements</b> with ever shorter intervals for standards development. The current timelines {{at which a}} new version of the specification is to be completed to the needed level of precision, quality and completeness cannot be accommodated using existing specification techniques. A key assumption is that future standards work must apply techniques that can be automated. The use of formal documentation techniques using commercial tools will shorten the standards development cycle, introduce a formal test methodology, and assist in rapid validation and verification, harmonization, and evolution of ANSI- 41 /WIN standards. This paper begins with an introduction of certain relevant documentation techniques. The techniques utilized for the creation of ANSI- 41 and the Wireless Intelligent Network (WIN) standard are examined and analyzed. This is used to identify opportunities to utilize docu [...] ...|$|E

We focus on physical media and transmission technologies, <b>subscriber</b> <b>requirements</b> and ongoing trials and offered services. We examine the physical media drawbacks and the transmission technologies which extract out of each medium as much bandwidth as possible {{through the use of}} clever modulation techniques. Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) technologies (e. g. ADSL) allow broadband delivery over copper phone lines while cable modems provide the bandwidth to support multimedia services over the coaxial cable. Finally the wireless solution can be realized through the use of microwaves (e. g. LMDS) or via communication satellites. All the above transmission technologies have been developed in order to extend the fiber optic backbone distribution network to the peoples premices through the use of media less costly than fiber.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a mathematical model}} for the automated design of fixed wireless access networks (FWA) through the automatic selection and configuration of base station sites. An optimisation algorithm is presented which generates the fixed wireless access network infrastructure design, and results are presented to illustrate {{the use of the}} model and its implementation. Economic measures based on the net present value (NPV) are defined to assess the financial viability of potential network designs. The NPV is used within the mathematical optimization framework to produce cost-effective deployments that maximize economic performance while maintaining technical constraints on the network. The model takes into account time-varying input parameters on CapEx, OpEx, revenues and <b>subscriber</b> <b>requirements</b> to model the dynamic nature of the market. Technical radio constraints taken into account include downlink area coverage, interference, capacity and availability. The model and optimisation framework are illustrated by considering the deployment and configuration of infrastructure for three scenarios representing urban, suburban and rural regions. Experiments illustrating the staged deployment of infrastructure over a number of time periods are also presented...|$|E
40|$|The Service Broker adds {{additional}} {{capabilities to}} static service brokering functions {{provided by the}} initial Filter Criteria in the S-CSCF and enables the possibility of dynamic service brokering functions in IMS. Given a set of IMS applications, depending on the <b>subscriber's</b> <b>requirements</b> there may be multiple sequences or ways of integrating these applications. With the initial Filter Criteria, only a static order of chaining these applications is possible. We propose that the Service Broker, via the service invocation history in the ISC and rule-based interaction logic provisioned offline, can provide this additional function of dynamically chaining the IMS services at the run time based on service invocation history. Note that the existing iFC mechanism in S-CSCF {{will continue to be}} utilized and {{play a key role in}} enabling these dynamic service brokering functions.

40|$|Providing delay-reduced routing is {{important}} in publish-subscribe systems where timely delivery of event notifications is a critical factor affecting system operation or user experience. However, common research focused primarily on alleviating false-positives. More recent efforts aim towards quality related issues through adapting the overlay according to <b>subscriber</b> <b>requirements</b> but leaving underlying network characteristics aside. It is commonly accepted that efficient routing can only be achieved when underlying network characteristics are respected. Even so, incorporating underlay-aware strategies to build low-stretch overlays is not considered in many distributed environments. This work focuses on solving the problem of establishing an efficient underlay-aware routing mechanism in a content-based publish-subscribe system. In particular, we strive to reduce end-to-end delay among communication partners. Thereby, our contributions are twofold: We will develop a topology inference scheme for unstructured peer-to-peer networks and introduce a routing mechanism reducing overall end-to-end delay among peers. Experimental evaluations will be given for different Internet-like router topologies showing that the approach is capable of modeling an underlay network in an efficient and accurate manner. Furthermore, we will show the {{positive impact on the}} stretch of the overlay to outline the concept as a source for efficient event notification delivery in a publish-subscribe environment...|$|E
40|$|When the Swedish {{electricity}} {{market was}} re-regulated in 1996 the trading with electricity {{was exposed to}} competition and the net service henceforth should be comprised by a monopoly comprised by a regulation. The regulation {{was based on a}} review of the costs of the network companies. No attention were paid to if the network was efficient. The following years many of the networks were sold from the municipalities to power companies, to increasing merger prices. The increasing prices in the mergers were followed by increasing prices to the subscribers of the network services. The regulator tried to stop the fast increasing prices, but didn’t succeed. The regulation paradigm couldn’t face the new realities and had to be revised. In 1998 the author of this thesis was commissioned by the Swedish Regulator to propose a new regulation model for the Swedish grid companies. Existing models were reviewed but none of them fulfilled the requirements from the regulator; to be self-regulating and give incentives to improved efficiency and distribution reliability. Therefore a new approach was launched. The new approach was to change perspective from a company focus to a consumer focus – a performance-based regulation. The solution was to base the regulation of the creation of a standard asset, a Reference Network. From this a new model – the Network Performance Assessment Model (NPAM) – was defined. The Reference Network is defined by four definitions, concerning the elements and topology of a Reference Network, the <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Requirements</b> and the Objective Prerequisites. These definitions grants the transparency of the model. The model is sharp and is run into operation in 2004. The final test of the model indicated that the Swedish network companies are overcharging their subscribers with approximately 20 %. This thesis is an explanation of the model and the definitions, and a review of the thoughts and research which formed the model. Moreover there is a discussion of some topics reported by others in articles about the model. Finally in the conclusion there are topics of simplicity and transparency. QC 2010120...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Efficient {{video-on-demand}} (VoD) is {{a highly}} desired service for media and telecom providers. VoD allows subscribers to view any item in a large media catalog nearly-instantaneously. However, systems that provide this service currently require large amounts of centralized resources and significant bandwidth to accommodate their <b>subscribers.</b> Hardware <b>requirements</b> become more substantial as the service providers increase the catalog size or number of subscribers. In this paper, we describe how cable companies can leverage deployed hardware in a peer-topeer architecture to provide an efficient alternative. We propose a distributed VoD system, and use real measurements from a deployed VoD system to evaluate different design decisions. Our results show that with minor changes, currently deployed cable infrastructures can support a video-on-demand system that scales to {{a large number of}} users and catalog size with low centralized resources.

40|$|Abstract. Monitoring and {{analyzing}} logs {{has become increasingly}} important to provide security and optimal functionality. We need a system to monitor logs from any source (e. g. applications, hardware devices and network), analyze them and give notifications of any problematic or unusual activity like firewall attacks, system failures or other warnings, {{in order to make}} proper decisions in near real-time. Publish/Subscribe is a system which make users able to express their interests (subscriptions) in events (publications). It gets events from information publishers and event <b>requirements</b> from <b>subscribers,</b> and sends events to <b>subscribers</b> whose <b>requirements</b> match the events. Log monitoring requires to handle stateful subscriptions that span multiple events and notify users with witness events as soon as their query has been satisfied. In this master thesis, we study how well publish/subscribe system can be used for log monitoring. In this context, we propose some advances, specially for dealing with out-of-order streams...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Current {{distributed}} publish/subscribe systems {{assume that}} all participants have similar QoS requirements and equally contribute to the system’s resources. However, inmany real-world applications, themes-sage delay tolerance of individual peers may differ widely. Disseminating messages according to individual delay requirements not only allows for the satisfaction of user-specific needs but also significantly improves the utilization of the resources in a publish/subscribe system. In this paper, we propose a peer-to-peer-based approach to satisfy the individual de-lay <b>requirements</b> of <b>subscribers</b> {{in the presence of}} bandwidth constraints. Our approach allows subscribers to dynamically adjust the granularity of their subscriptions according to their bandwidth constraints and de-lay <b>requirements.</b> <b>Subscribers</b> maintain the publish/subscribe overlay in a decentralized manner by establishing connections to peers that provide messages meeting exactly their subscription granularity and complying to their delay requirements. Evaluations show that for practical workloads, the proposed system scales up to a large number of subscribers and per-forms robustly in a very dynamic setting. ...|$|R
40|$|How Exchange and Vendor {{allocate}} {{responsibility for}} use {{and distribution of}} Information by Client; extent that Vendor is responsible for compliance by Client with Exchange requirements. ● These issues are usually addressed by: * The form and content of Subscriber agreement under which Client receives Information. * Obligations on Vendor to discontinue supply of Information to certain Clients on request by the Exchange. Business Consideration: Exchanges, Vendors and above all Clients have a common interest in ensuring that contract requirements for use of Exchange Information by Clients are simple, broadly consistent between Exchanges and interpreted in a broadly consistent manner by Vendors. Globally consistent Subscriber Agreement terms for Exchange Information would enable Clients to develop standard reporting and compliance systems, improving the efficiency and cutting the cost of market data administration for all parties. The fundamental <b>Subscriber</b> Agreement <b>requirement</b> is stated with admirable brevity by the New Zealand Stock Exchange contract. The NZSE contract does not require Vendor-Subscriber agreements to protect the Exchange’s right to obtain and audit all information necessary to confirm compliance and assess applicable fees. With this exception, it provides a brief but comprehensive requirement specification and point of comparison for the more detailed Exchange specifications and requirements.

50|$|In most areas, one carrier held a {{monopoly}} on local service. The landline telephone system was originally constructed in an era before transistorisation, remote concentrators or cabinetisation. Individual lines from subscribers ran not to a remote concentrator but directly to the nearest village community dial office, to be terminated at an automated mechanical switch or manual exchange. To keep <b>subscriber</b> loop wiring <b>requirements</b> manageable, local exchanges were built in each tiny hamlet. Rural subscribers often made do with party line service. Each village was a separate rate center for long-distance calls and each had its own block of ten thousand numbers (the largest that reasonably could fit on a small-town manual cord switchboard with a jack and indicator for each line). In most small villages, many of these numbers would remain unused. In large cities, multiple exchanges were created to cover individual districts or neighbourhoods; each had its own series of distinctive prefixes, and multiple blocks of ten thousand numbers each. The first few digits of a number uniquely identified a village, a town or a neighbourhood of a big city.|$|R
40|$|Due to spatio-temporal {{variation}} of mobile <b>subscriber's</b> data traffic <b>requirements,</b> traffic load experienced by base stations present at different cell sites exhibit highly dynamic behavior in traditional cellular systems. This non-uniform and dynamic traffic load leads to under {{utilization of the}} base station computing resources at cell sites. Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN) is an innovative architecture which addresses this issue and keeps the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) under safe limit for cellular operators. In C-RAN, the baseband processing units (BBUs) are segregated from cell sites and are pooled in a central cloud data center thereby facilitating shared access {{for a set of}} Remote Radio Heads (RRHs) present at cell sites. In order to truly exploit the benefits of C-RAN, the BBU pool deployed in the cloud has to efficiently serve clusters of RRHs (i. e., many-to-one mapping between RRHs and BBUs in the BBU pool) and thereby minimizing the required number of active BBUs. In this work, potential benefits of C-RAN are studied by considering realistic traffic loads of base stations deployed in urban areas by using statistical models. We propose a lightweight and load-aware algorithm, Dynamic RRH Assignment (DRA), which achieves BBU pooling gain close to that of a well known First-Fit Decreasing (FFD) bin packing algorithm. Using extensive simulations, we show that DRA consumes only 25 % of time on average compared to FFD for the case of urban cellular deployment of 1000 RRHs. DRA slightly overestimates the required number of active BBUs as compared to FFD by 1. 7 % and 1. 4 % for weekdays and weekends, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{progress}} in telecommunication and introduction of wireless phones has revolutionized the way, {{in which the}} analog signal is treated. High Radio Frequency (RF) pollution caused by increased number of <b>subscribers</b> imposes new <b>requirements</b> {{on the quality of}} transmitted RF signal. These requirements are met by introduction of Digital Direct Synthesis (DDS) of Intermediate Frequency (IF). The DDS eliminates the analog IF mixing stage, which is responsible interference with modulated signal. The high accuracy of DDS modulation is possible only with high quality digital-to-analog conversion. The design of Digital-to-Analog Converters (DAC) providing high-speed and high-resolution is extremely difficult. To overcome problems caused by manufacturing process variation numerous techniques such as thermometer coding or calibration are utilized in DAC design. However, in many cases implementation of these techniques becomes a source of new problems such as clock jitter or glitch. To solve them simulation of DAC, depicting numerous effects of physical phenomena, is an absolute necessity. Unfortunately such simulation with utilization of off-the-shelf mixed signal simulators is very demanding. Therefore simulation of all DAC circuit becomes impractical due to long simulation time or lack of good models of still studied phenomena such as glitch. A novel method allowing for simultaneous and accurate representation of numerous phenomena and significantly increasing simulation speed is proposed. The method is called a Perfect Sampling Technique (PST) and it allows for precise calculation of most important in telecommunication dynamic DAC performance metric [...] -the Spurious Free Dynamic Range (SFDR). The technique was primarily built to overcome the deficiencies of popular Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). This novel approach allows for concurrent simulation of the following phenomena: deterministic and random clock jitter, random and graded current source mismatch, and the glitch and output finite impedance. The implemented in Visual C++ simulator provides means of representation of various DAC structures: segmentation (thermometer and binary coding), 2 D layout of current source matrix and analog switch dynamic characteristics. It utilizes behavioral models of DAC building blocks (analog switches) in custom-built extremely fast event driven simulation framework. It also provides means for parametric, statistical, transient and spectral analysis of DAC...|$|R
