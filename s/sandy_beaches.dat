5|$|Caribbean {{monk seals}} {{were found in}} warm temperate, {{subtropical}} and tropical waters of the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and the west Atlantic Ocean. They probably preferred to haul out at sites (low <b>sandy</b> <b>beaches</b> above high tide) on isolated and secluded atolls and islands, but occasionally would visit the mainland coasts and deeper waters offshore. This species may have fed in shallow lagoons and reefs.|$|E

5|$|Although Carmarthenshire is less frequented as {{a tourist}} {{destination}} than some other counties in Wales, it offers {{a wide range of}} outdoor activities. Much of the coast is fairly flat; it includes the Millennium Coastal Park, which extends for ten miles to the west of Llanelli; the National Wetlands Centre; a championship golf course; and the harbours of Burry Port and Pembrey. Further west are the <b>sandy</b> <b>beaches</b> at Llansteffan and Pendine, and Dylan Thomas' boathouse at Laugharne. Further inland {{there are a number of}} medieval castles, hillforts and standing stones.|$|E
5|$|Destruction and {{encroachment}} {{of habitat}} by humans is another threat to loggerhead sea turtles. Optimum nesting beaches are open-sand beaches above the high-tide line. However, beach development deprives them of suitable nesting areas, {{forcing them to}} nest closer to the surf. Urbanization often leads to the siltation of <b>sandy</b> <b>beaches,</b> decreasing their viability. Construction of docks and marinas can destroy near-shore habitats. Boat traffic and dredging degrades habitat and can also injure or kill turtles when boats collide with turtles {{at or near the}} surface.|$|E

5|$|The Republic of Senegal {{placed an}} {{emphasis}} on tourism early in its history. The results were promising, and developing the industry further became a priority in the country's 4th Economic and Social Plan (19731977). Casamance subsequently became the main tourist destination in the country.

Each beach has nearby cafés, restaurants and public houses, and a European Blue Flag Award is shared between them due to their cleanliness and safety.|$|E
40|$|Resilient <b>sandy</b> <b>beach</b> {{ecosystems}} {{adapt to}} sea level rise while preserving their structure, function and feedbacks. Coastal processes, such as landward migration, enable <b>sandy</b> <b>beach</b> ecosystems to retreat as sea levels increase. Migrating beaches provide refugia where species can persist over geological timescales. However, bouldered beachwalls, {{used to protect}} coastal development from coastal erosion, form barriers that significantly impede beach retreat. The extent beachwalls change the resilience of <b>sandy</b> <b>beach</b> ecosystems is unknown. Through synthesis of existing research, we propose a framework that theoretically assesses the resilience of <b>sandy</b> <b>beach</b> ecosystems using the characteristic properties of resilient ecosystems, elasticity, amplitude, hysteresis and malleability. Resilience behaviour of <b>sandy</b> <b>beach</b> ecosystems is critically influenced by beachwalls. Beachwalls decrease elasticity: the rate of recovery, and amplitude: the ability to withstand disturbance. Beachwalls also restrict recovery via the reverse of degradation, thereby increasing hysteresis. Malleability increases as the resemblance of <b>sandy</b> <b>beach</b> ecosystems after recovery diverges from pre-impact condition. Our findings highlight the significance of integrating ecosystem resilience into the design and implementation of coastal management strategies that facilitate the preservation of suitable habitats in which species can persist...|$|R

5|$|Adults {{make their}} homes within holes in various {{mangrove}} trees and maintain an arboreal existence whereas the young are strictly terrestrial {{for the first}} year of their lives. As the Utila iguana cannot successfully lay its eggs in the mangrove swamps, the gravid females are forced to migrate to nearby <b>sandy</b> <b>beaches</b> in order to bury their clutches of eggs so they can incubate in the hot sun. After digging their nest burrows and laying their eggs, the females abandon the nests and return to the mangroves. Sixty to seventy-four days later the hatchlings emerge and move back to the swamps.|$|E

The coastline includes shifting sandbanks and <b>sandy</b> <b>beaches.</b> There are areas of quicksand close to the harbour. Nouakchott is largely flat and only a few meters above sea level. It is threatened by the sand dunes advancing from its eastern side which pose a daily problem. There have been efforts to save particular areas, including work by Jean Meunier. Owing to the rapid build-up, the city is quite spread out, with few tall buildings. Most buildings are one-story.|$|E

In Shark Bay, Western Australia, juvenile milk sharks inhabit seagrass meadows composed of Amphibolis antarctica and Posidonia australis. Although some sources state this species avoids low salinities, it has been reported several times from fresh water in Cambodia, as far upstream as the Tonlé Sap. Milk sharks may be found anywhere in the water column from the surface to the bottom. Off KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, its numbers fluctuate annually with a peak in summer, suggesting some form of seasonal movement.|$|E
5|$|Since 1725, the iodine-rich seawaters of Póvoa, {{due to the}} {{peculiar}} high quantities of seaweed that ends up in Póvoa beaches from the sheltered bay to Cape Santo André, brought by ocean currents, lead that Benedictine monks choose to take sea-baths in there, searching cures for skin and bone problems. Still in the 18th century, other people went to Póvoa with the same concerns. In the 19th century, the town became popular as a summer destination for the wealthy of Entre-Douro-e-Minho province and Portuguese Brazilians, due to its large <b>sandy</b> <b>beaches</b> {{and the development of}} theaters, hotels and casinos.

5|$|The Hawaiian monk seal, as {{the name}} suggests, lives solely in the Hawaiian archipelago.

The Isthmus of Panama closed the Seaway approximately 3 million years ago. The species may have evolved in the Pacific or Atlantic, but in either case, came to Hawaii long before the first Polynesians.
