He was befriended and mentored by the RAAF's top-scoring ace, Clive [...] "Killer" [...] Caldwell, who became godfather to Waddy's daughter. Waddy's first operational sortie was as Caldwell's wingman; {{he found the}} ensuing dogfight <b>so</b> <b>fast</b> <b>and</b> confusing {{that he had no}} idea what was happening and afterwards had to ask the more experienced pilot how things had gone. On 9December, he registered his first victory—in a Tomahawk that had previously been Caldwell's personal mount—when he shared in the destruction of a Messerschmitt Bf110 twin-engined fighter near El Adem.|$|E

[...] 411Mania's Ron Martin described the episode as having a [...] "ridiculous set up". Andre Dellamorte of Collider thought negatively of the episode as well, calling it [...] "Mannered {{to the point of}} ridiculousness." [...] While he didn't consider it the worst episode he's ever seen, he criticized the episode's pacing and lack of satire, writing [...] "it’s just that the plates spin <b>so</b> <b>fast</b> <b>and</b> so pointlessly that it becomes just about the gags. [...] the satire is gone; it’s just incident after incident to set up gags (some of which are funny) and get the show to an end time." ...|$|E

Taking {{advantage}} of the Dark Blues' struggle in rough water by Craven Cottage, Cambridge slowly drew ahead and held a three-quarter length lead by the time the crews passed the Mile Post.

500|$|Phagocytosis is {{the process}} of taking in {{particles}} such as bacteria, parasites, dead host cells, and cellular and foreign debris by a cell. It involves a chain of molecular processes. Phagocytosis occurs after the foreign body, a bacterial cell, for example, has bound to molecules called [...] "receptors" [...] that are {{on the surface of the}} phagocyte. The phagocyte then stretches itself around the bacterium and engulfs it. Phagocytosis of bacteria by human neutrophils takes on average nine minutes. Once inside this phagocyte, the bacterium is trapped in a compartment called a phagosome. Within one minute the phagosome merges with either a lysosome or a granule to form a phagolysosome. The bacterium is then subjected to an overwhelming array of killing mechanisms and is dead a few minutes later. Dendritic cells and macrophages are not <b>so</b> <b>fast,</b> <b>and</b> phagocytosis can take many hours in these cells. Macrophages are slow and untidy eaters; they engulf huge quantities of material and frequently release some undigested back into the tissues. This debris serves as a signal to recruit more phagocytes from the blood. Phagocytes have voracious appetites; scientists have even fed macrophages with iron filings and then used a small magnet to separate them from other cells.|$|E

[...] In regards to Jack's love triangle, Rabin opined that this arc [...] "could easily have worn out its welcome long ago" [...] but that Alec Baldwin, Julianne Moore, and Elizabeth Banks [...] "have kept lively and vibrant." [...] In conclusion, he gave it an A− grade rating. Meredith Blake, writing for the Los Angeles Times, was positive about Liz getting engaged, noting that she has become a woman, and concluded that [...] "it will no doubt be one of television's most memorable weddings" [...] if Liz and Wesley get married. Nick Catucci of New York magazine said that [...] "Emanuelle Goes to Dinosaur Land" [...] was good, [...] "aybe the best episode ever."

Of the episode she said, [...] "The suspects pile up <b>so</b> <b>fast</b> <b>and</b> furious, that it's difficult to figure out the perpetrator until they are ready to tell you. She added that she had [...] "much respect for that method of storytelling". She continued, [...] "There is nothing I enjoy less than watching the crime being committed in the first minutes of a show and then watching the respective squad of police and detectives miss clues we already know. Body of Proof isn't afraid to allow the audience to use their intellect". Pavlica also enjoyed the relationship between Megan and Lacey, calling it [...] "heart wrenching" [...] saying that she had a tear in eye due to the scenes. [...] "I'm enjoying how the writers are piecing together the strained relationship they had, in a realistic, no holds barred way". However, Pavica was afraid to [...] "jinx" [...] the show, as she had [...] "no idea of Body of Proofs place in the ratings", adding that she was [...] "nervous" [...] as it is up against shows such as The Good Wife and Parenthood.|$|E

Some officers of the Nazi German Ordnungspolizei felt uneasy about killing non-Jewish Poles. Their unit shot 4,600 Jews by September 1942, but disproportionately only 78 ethnic Poles.
