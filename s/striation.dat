40|$|A {{new theory}} of a {{stationary}} state of <b>striations</b> is presented. <b>Striations</b> {{are treated as}} slowly varying with the height wave-guides that trap upper-hybrid resonance (UHR) oscillations. Modes with different discrete eigennumbers are retained in <b>striations.</b> Each mode interacts with a pump wave within a restricted range of heights. Thus the vertical ionospheric inhomogeneity determines the amplification of UHR oscillations. Anomalous absorption of the pump wave associated with the excitation of UHR oscillations in <b>striations</b> is calculated. Typical transversal scales and increase of the electron temperature in <b>striations</b> are estimated...|$|R

Previous re-search has shown the proportion of <b>striations</b> in cartilage fallsfollowing decomposition. This project has investigated theeffects of taphonomic alteration and documentation methodsof <b>striations</b> in porcine skin. Fresh, decomposed, mummified,burnt and waterlogged stab wounds in a porcine analoguewere excised and imaged using photography, stereo-opticalmicroscopy and micro-CT. The proportion of <b>striations</b> ineach taphonomic group was determined from the images byindependent analysts. <b>Striations</b> were observed more frequent-ly in serrated blade wounds, although they were also identifiedin non-serrated blade wounds. The proportion of woundsshowing <b>striations</b> declined following decomposition. An in-versely proportional linear correlation between advancing de-composition and proportion of <b>striations</b> existed. Dehydration(mummification and burning) rendered serrated and non-serrated blade wounds indistinguishable.

5|$|Both the {{function}} {{and the appearance}} in life of the extremely elongated and bifurcated vertebral spines remain elusive. Salgado and Bonaparte (1991) suggested the spines represented defense weapons against predators, arguing that they tapered towards their tips. In a subsequent skeletal reconstruction drawing, Salgado (1999) depicted the neural spines supporting a keratinous sheath, which could have added significantly to the total length of the spines. The presence of a covering, either of keratin or skin, is shown by a <b>striation</b> pattern {{on the surface of}} the spines similar to the bony horn cores of today's bovids. American science writer Gregory Paul (2000) argued that the spines, if elongated by a keratinous sheath, could have been used as a weapon both against predators and members of the same species, as the animal might have been able to point its most anterior spines forward by bending its neck. He also hypothesized that the spines could have been clattered together to generate sound. In 2016, Mark Hallett and Mathew Wedel suggested that the backwards-directed spines might have been able to skewer predators when the neck was abruptly drawn backwards during an attack. A similar defense strategy is found in today's giant sable antelope and Arabian oryx, which can use their long, backwards directed horns to stab attacking lions. Apart from the possible function in defense, the spines may have been used for display, either for the intimidation of rivaling individuals or for courtship. Hallett and Wedel also hypothesized that rival males might have interlocked their spines for neck wrestling.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} numerically {{the interaction}} between ionospheric magnetic field-aligned density <b>striations</b> and a left-hand circularly polarized (L) -mode wave. The L -mode wave is scattered into upper hybrid (UH) waves which are partially trapped in the <b>striations,</b> but leak energy to electromagnetic waves in the Z -mode branch. For small-amplitude (1 %) <b>striations,</b> this loss mechanism leads to {{a significant reduction in}} amplitude of the UH waves. For several <b>striations</b> organized in a lattice, the leaking of Z -mode waves is compensated by influx of Z -mode radiation from neighboring <b>striations,</b> leading to an increased amplitude of the weakly trapped UH waves. For large-amplitude (10 %) <b>striations</b> the trapped UH waves rapidly increase in amplitude far beyond the threshold for parametric instabilities, and the Z -mode leakage is less important.

500|$|Prior to September 2005, {{comparative}} bullet-lead {{analysis was}} performed on bullets found at a scene that were too destroyed for <b>striation</b> comparison. The technique would attempt to determine the unique elemental breakdown of the bullet and compare it to seized bullets possessed by a suspect. Review of the method found that the breakdown of elements found in bullets could be significantly different enough to potentially allow for two bullets from separate sources to be correlated to each other. However, {{there is not enough}} differences to definitely match a bullet from a crime scene to one taken from a suspect's possession. An additional report in 2004 from the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) found that the testimony given regarding comparative bullet-lead analysis was overstated and potentially [...] "misleading under the federal rules of evidence".

2500|$|Oscar Tiegs' {{doctoral}} thesis work {{was to be}} the basis for much of his later work, in embryological studies, and the study of fine structures in muscle.

He also found a similar condition in vertebrate muscles. Later he discovered that former histologists had recorded the same thing, but their observations had received little attention. He contended that helicoidal <b>striation</b> is a general feature of muscles and that muscular conduction takes place along this helicoidal path, even though the evidence for this generality was against him, yet his cinematographic records supported his interpretation for arachnids and other arthropods.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between coherent eddies and zonally elongated <b>striations.</b> The investigation involves an analysis of two baroclinic quasigeostrophic models of a zonal and double-gyre flow {{and a set of}} altimetry sea level anomaly data in the North Pacific. <b>Striations</b> are defined by either spatiotemporal filtering or empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs), with both approaches leading to consistent results. Coherent eddies, identified here by the modified Okubo???Weiss parameter, tend to propagate along well-defined paths, thus forming ???eddy trains??? that coincide with <b>striations.</b> The <b>striations</b> and eddy trains tend to drift away from the intergyre boundary at the same speed in both the model and observations. The EOF analysis further confirms that these <b>striations</b> in model simulations and altimetry are not an artifact of temporal averaging of random, spatially uncorrelated vortices. This study suggests instead that eddies organize into eddy trains, which manifest themselves as <b>striations</b> in low-pass filtered data and EOF modes...|$|R

Results reveal that <b>striations</b> coincide with both polarized eddy tracks and the offshore formation of new eddies in the subtropical front and coastal transition zone, without any significant decay over time that discards random eddies as a primary driver of the <b>striations.</b> Localized patches of vortex stretching and relative vorticity advection, alternating meridionally near {{the eastern edge of the}} subtropical front, are associated with topographic steering of the background flow in the presence of steep topography, and with baroclinically and barotropically unstable meridional flow. These sinks and sources of vorticity are suggested to generate the banded structure further west, consistently with a -plume mechanism. On the other hand, zonal/meridional eddy advection of relative vorticity and the associated Reynolds stress covariance are consistent with eddy deformation over rough topography and participate to sustain the <b>striations</b> in the far field. Shear instability of mean <b>striations</b> is proposed to feedback onto the eddy field, acting to maintain the subtropical front eddy streets and thus the <b>striations...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Andrews {{was forced}} to quit the show {{towards the end of}} the Broadway run in 1997 when she {{developed}} hoarseness in her voice.

60|$|We here {{encounter}} a great difficulty. How can the contraction of the unstriped and involuntary arrectores pili have been co-ordinated {{with that of}} various voluntary muscles for the same special purpose? If we could believe that the arrectores primordially had been voluntary muscles, and had since lost their stripes and become involuntary, the case would be comparatively simple. I am not, however, aware {{that there is any}} evidence in favour of this view; although the reversed transition would not have presented any great difficulty, as the voluntary muscles are in an unstriped condition in the embryos of the higher animals, and in the larvae of some crustaceans. Moreover in the deeper layers of the skin of adult birds, the muscular network is, according to Leydig,[20] in a transitional condition; the fibres exhibiting only indications of transverse <b>striation.</b>|$|E

40|$|Electron {{microscope}} {{studies have}} been conducted on individual fibers of human deoxyhemoglobin S (sickle cell hemoglobin). The fibers are obtained by injection of gelled samples into a large excess of glutaraldehyde, which quickly stabilizes the fibers by cross-linking. The fibers are negatively stained with phosphotungstic acid or shadowed with platinum-carbon. The fibers are approximately 200 Å in diameter, and display long and short helical <b>striations</b> with an opposite handedness. The long <b>striations</b> occur at an angle of about 15 ° from the fiber axis, and complete one turn around the helix at a distance of about 2 × 103 Å along the fiber axis. The short <b>striations</b> occur at an angle of about 80 ° from the fiber axis, with a spacing of about 65 Å, and complete one turn around the helix at a distance along the fiber axis of about 130 Å. The structure of the fiber appears to be a sextuple helix in terms of the long <b>striations,</b> and a double helix in terms of the short <b>striations.</b> The shadowed samples are consistent with a left-handed screw sense for the short <b>striations,</b> thus implying a right-handed sense for the long <b>striations.</b> A structural model incorporating these features is compatible with the atomic structure of hemoglobin, with individual molecules oriented with their dyad axis of symmetry perpendicular to the fiber axis and their α 1 -β 1 pseudo-dyad axis roughly parallel to the fiber axis. This orientation places the two β- 6 regions of each molecule (sites of the sickle cell mutation) in contact with the β- 6 regions of the molecules above and below along the long <b>striations.</b> Both the long and short <b>striations</b> are accounted for by individual hemoglobin molecules arranged in double helical arrays with 6. 4 molecules per turn in each array...|$|R

Fresh-water shells are also subject to great variation, so that there is much uncertainty as to the number of species; and variations are especially frequent in the Planorbidae, which exhibit many eccentric deviations from the usual form of the species--deviations which must often affect the form of the living animal. In Mr. Ingersoll's Report on the Recent Mollusca of Colorado many of these extraordinary variations are referred to, and it is stated that a shell (Helisonia trivolvis) abundant in some small ponds and lakes, had scarcely two specimens alike, and many of them closely resembled other and altogether distinct species.[17] ...|$|E
60|$|Bone.--Small smooth bits of {{the dried}} hyoidal bone of a fowl {{moistened}} with saliva were placed on two leaves, and a similarly moistened splinter of an extremely hard, broiled mutton-chop bone on a third leaf. These leaves soon became strongly inflected, and remained so for an unusual length of time; namely, one leaf for ten {{and the other two}} for nine days. The bits of bone were surrounded all the time by acid secretion. When examined under a weak power, they were found quite softened, so that they were readily penetrated by a blunt needle, torn into fibres, or compressed. Dr. Klein was so kind as to make sections of both bones and examine them. He informs me that both presented the normal appearance of decalcified bone, with traces of the earthy salts occasionally left. The corpuscles with their processes were very distinct in most parts; but in some parts, especially near the periphery of the hyoidal bone, none could be seen. Other parts again appeared amorphous, with even the longitudinal <b>striation</b> of bone not distinguishable. This amorphous structure, [page 106] as Dr. Klein thinks, may be the result either of the incipient digestion of the fibrous basis or of all the animal matter having been removed, the corpuscles being thus rendered invisible. A hard, brittle, yellowish substance occupied the position of the medulla in the fragments of the hyoidal bone.|$|E
60|$|All {{important}} existing {{forms are}} owing to disintegration, or {{the action of}} water. That of ice had been curiously over-rated. As an instrument of sculpture, ice is much less powerful than water; the apparently energetic effects of it being merely the exponents of disintegration. A glacier did not produce its moraine, but sustained and exposed the fragments which fell on its surface, pulverizing these by keeping them in motion, but producing very unimportant effects on the rock below; the roundings and <b>striation</b> produced by ice were superficial; while a torrent penetrated into every angle and cranny, undermining and wearing continually, and carrying stones, at the lowest estimate, six hundred thousand {{times as fast as}} the glacier. Had the quantity of rain which has fallen on Mont Blanc in the form of snow (and descended in the ravines as ice) fallen as rain, and descended in torrents, the ravines would have been much deeper than they are now, and the glacier may so far be considered as exercising a protective influence. But its power of carriage is unlimited, and when masses of earth or rock are once loosened, the glacier carries them away, and exposes fresh surfaces. Generally, the work of water and ice is in mountain surgery like that of lancet and sponge--one for incision, the other for ablution. No excavation by ice was possible on a large scale, any more than by a stream of honey; and its various actions, with their limitations, were only to be understood by keeping always clearly in view the great law of its motion as a viscous substance, determined by Professor James Forbes.|$|E

The earlier phase was probably due to compression from the NNW in the Mesozoic and produced strike slip faults striking 1000 and 1700 C.
