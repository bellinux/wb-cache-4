5|$|After {{peace was}} {{achieved}} with France in 1558, military attention shifted towards the Spanish {{threat to the}} increasingly prosperous south-west side of England. Tensions with Spain grew and invasion appeared likely in 1589, resulting in royal permission being given to reuse the stonework from the East Blockhouse for new coastal defences, but this work was not carried out. The fort continued to decay until the 20th century. With {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War in 1939, the East Blockhouse was adapted for use by the British military. The interior was cleared out and a shed was built in one corner. A slit trench was dug on the north <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> a rifle embrasure formed on the east <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> and a machine-gun position was dug out and protected with sandbags outside it.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, two Port Orford cedar {{trees were}} {{planted on the}} east side of City Hall. One tree was planted on the north side and the second tree on the south <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> to {{reinforce}} the symmetrical aspects of the building. The south tree was replaced in 1999 due to poor health. In 1910, the city added passenger elevators to the open stairwells.|$|E

5|$|On June 17, 1996, a -long boom {{portion of}} a {{construction}} crane crashed at the construction site, scraping the stone on the east <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> but not injuring anyone. Due to the fragile sandstone exterior, the damage on the rotunda was not repaired. In January 1997, construction crews finished the demolition portion {{of the project and}} finished the structural reinforcement part before they began the interior construction phase.|$|E
5|$|Only in 2007, 17 {{years after}} his death, was a small {{memorial}} plaque placed on the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> where he lived in Rostov-on-Don. There is also a memorial wall with his name engraved on it in Boston. A street was named in his honor in Safed, Israel, and a stone memorial erected in Tel Aviv more recently.|$|E
5|$|The 2006 New York City {{plane crash}} {{occurred}} on October 11, 2006, when a Cirrus SR20 general aviation, fixed-wing, single-engine light aircraft {{crashed into the}} Belaire Apartments in New York City at about 2:42p.m. local time (18:42 UTC). The aircraft struck the north <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> located on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, causing a fire in several apartments, which was extinguished within two hours.|$|E

5|$|The {{north side}} of the DeKalb County Courthouse is not as ornately {{decorated}} as the south face but each has its own distinctive qualities. The courthouse drive, entering from Exchange Street, crosses below a stone porte-cochere on the courthouse property. The back <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> features four pilasters with composite capitals which give the courthouse a temple appearance.|$|E
5|$|The railway has two tracks (partly {{located in}} Rome, outside the gateway), {{but only one}} is served by a station platform. Two {{terminal}} load tracks, for freight wagons, are situated on the northeast <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> They {{are linked to the}} main track that ends in a headshunt in a tunnel.|$|E
5|$|The south {{leg of the}} Chicago Transit Authority {{elevated}} rail loop runs next to the building on Van Buren Street; the CTA's Brown, Orange, Pink, and Purple Lines are served by the Library-State/Van Buren stop one block to the east.

5|$|The tower has two outdoor {{terraces}} {{as part of}} Trump's {{agreement with}} the city during construction. There is a terrace {{on the fifth floor}} on the northern (57th Street) <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> with a smaller fourth-floor terrace on the southern (56th Street) side. The fifth-floor north-side terrace has several trees and a fountain, while the fourth-floor south-side terrace has little more than a few granite benches. There is also a passageway to a glass-roofed POPS at 590 Madison Avenue.|$|E
5|$|According to Dickens {{specialist}} Trey Philpotts, {{the newest}} arrival was usually placed with the youngest prisoner {{who was living}} alone. A wealthier prisoner could pay his roommate to go away—"buy out the chum"—for half-a-crown a week in 1818, while the outcast chum would sleep in the tap room or find another room to rent in the prison. The only prisoners not expected to pay chummage were debtors who had declared themselves insolvent by swearing an oath that they had assets worth less than 40 shillings. If their creditors agreed, they could be released after 14days, but if anyone objected, they remained confined to the poor <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building,</b> near the women's side, receiving a small weekly allowance from the county and money from charity.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{city hall}} was {{partially}} destroyed. Along {{the northwest corner}} of the building, the exterior wall in its entirely collapsed, while the north tower was destroyed. The bay at the northeastern <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> was removed. Additionally, the roof suffered complete destruction. As a result, Lake Worth was without a functional center for city government. A temporary city hall was established at the Lauriston building. Damage in Lake Worth reached approximately $4million. Three deaths occurred in Lake Worth, two from illnesses related to exposure to the storm; the other was a man who suffered from apoplexy, blamed on excessive exertion {{in the aftermath of the}} hurricane.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War, Liverpool's {{importance}} {{as a major}} port saw it become a target for the Luftwaffe and during the May Blitz of 1941, a heavy bomb exploded in the basement, on the eastern <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> The damage from the explosion was significant with the eastern wing being seriously damaged by fire. Nonetheless the building's structural integrity meant {{that much of the}} building could be re-occupied with only temporary repairs. In the aftermath of the war the building was fully restored; the cost of restoration exceeding the original construction costs.|$|E
5|$|Encompassing , the Seeley G. Mudd Chemistry Building stood {{three stories}} tall. The second and first floors (the latter of which lies {{partially}} below ground) contained laboratory space while {{the third floor}} consisted of communal and teaching spaces like classrooms and offices. Other offices {{on the first floor}} were lit via skylights. The stairwells in Mudd were designed with the purpose of discouraging students from passing through lab spaces to get from one <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> to the other. In spite of this, Michael J. Crosbie reported in Architecture in 1986 that students had taken to passing through the building as a shortcut instead of going around it. Furnishings and carpeting in the building were deep blue and rust-colored.|$|E
5|$|In Arlington County, Virginia, 125 Pentagon workers {{lost their}} lives when Flight 77 crashed into the western <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> Of these, 70 were civilians and 55 were {{military}} personnel, many of them {{who worked for the}} United States Army or the United States Navy. The Army lost 47 civilian employees, six civilian contractors, and 22 soldiers, while the Navy lost six civilian employees, three civilian contractors, and 33 sailors. Seven Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) civilian employees were also among the dead in the attack, as well as an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) contractor. Lieutenant General Timothy Maude, an Army Deputy Chief of Staff, was the highest-ranking military official killed at the Pentagon.|$|E

5|$|Plans {{for a new}} {{building}} on the site have gone through several generations. The first design consisted of a six-storey building (including basement), which had a large shop on the ground floor, {{as well as an}} underground car park and four floors of residential apartments, with a top level to hold the building's mechanics. Each floor would have 4,000 square feet (372 m2), and {{there would have been a}} leaning tower to the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b> The design was given planning permission in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Production on {{the film}} was {{temporarily}} shut down after a fire destroyed several soundstages at Paramount Studios, {{one of which was}} adjacent to the set for the Genesis planet. Initially, the set's pyrotechnics were suspected of causing the fire, but the cause was ruled to be arson. Shatner was among the cast members who grabbed fire hoses to stop the flames. Correll hoped the place would burn down so that he would get his chance to film in Hawaii. While most of the set was undamaged, holes in the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> had to be covered with heavy black curtains to prevent outside light from leaking in.|$|E
5|$|The 1857 {{house is}} in Regency {{architectural}} style. It was {{oriented so that}} its long side, facing north-east, was roughly parallel to Linwood Avenue. Rectangular in floor plan, the Linwood Avenue frontage had five bays, with the central bay pedimented, which gave the house a symmetrical look. An 1871 photo by Alfred Charles Barker, held by the Canterbury Museum, shows a verandah on the north-west <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> only. This verandah was later extended to cover the front as well, and it mirrors the pedimented central bay. A hipped roof was hidden behind a balustrade.|$|E
