The structural systems employed in these machines are predominately welded structures consisting of hot-rolled structural members with open or tubular profiles. The design of the overall systems {{as well as the}} members is often governed by stability and fatigue. Large proportion of these structural systems has already passed their initial design life and hence the management of <b>structural</b> <b>integrity</b> to ensure safety and reliability of operation is a significant technical challenge.

Analysis of the structural system is undertaken using FE models which are calibrated using measurements. The critical members and connections for inspections are identified from analysis and measurements. Guidelines are provided to site staff to respond appropriately if defects are found during inspections.

Moreover, to avoid damages caused by resonance, natural frequencies of vibration for the given tracking PV system are also determined.

A reasonable agreement between the simulations and experimental measurements is found such that the constructed FEA model is validated {{to be effective in}} assessment of the <b>structural</b> <b>integrity</b> for PV <b>systems</b> under self-weight.
