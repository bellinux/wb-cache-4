The Z-10 contained an IR searchlight (Spanner-Anlage) for the <b>Spanner</b> infrared detection system. A single Kauz II was equipped with and tested the Lichtenstein radar.|$|E

5|$|Abi starts dating Jordan, but {{months later}} he is {{attacked}} by Ben with a <b>spanner,</b> leaving him in a coma. They split up, but remain friends. Abi starts to {{take an interest in}} Max's lodger Darren Miller (Charlie G. Hawkins), who is left uncomfortable when she tries to kiss him, telling her she is too young and is heartbroken when Darren proposes to Jodie Gold (Kylie Babbington). Abi forms a close friendship with her mother's fiancé Greg Jessop (Stefan Booth). She later develops a crush on Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick), and the two begin dating. Believing Jay is only interested in Abi for sex, Max tries to split them up, but fails to do so. Jay and Abi plan to have sex several times, but on each occasion, they are unable to go through with it. At one time, Jay and Abi cuddle up as they are watching television, but Max believes they are about to have sex, so he throws Jay out and rips Abi's bridesmaid dress to Greg and Tanya's wedding. They go to buy a new one, but they have a car crash on Greg and Tanya's wedding day. They suffer minor injuries and both recover.|$|E

5|$|In 1150, {{it looked}} like Caithness and the whole earldom of Orkney {{were going to come}} under {{permanent}} Scottish control. However, David's plans for the north soon began to encounter problems. In 1151, King Eystein II of Norway put a <b>spanner</b> in the works by sailing through the waterways of Orkney with a large fleet and catching the young Harald unaware in his residence at Thurso. Eystein forced Harald to pay fealty as a condition of his release. Later in the year David hastily responded by supporting the claims to the Orkney earldom of Harald's rival Erlend Haraldsson, granting him half of Caithness in opposition to Harald. King Eystein responded in turn by making a similar grant to this same Erlend, cancelling the effect of David's grant. David's weakness in Orkney was that the Norwegian kings were not prepared to stand back and let him reduce their power.|$|E
5|$|The game retains some {{platforming}} traits; {{the player}} may disembark {{from a vehicle}} and explore the environment {{in a manner similar}} to that of the previous games. On foot the duo can grab ledges, swim underwater, balance on tightropes and perform basic jumps. Kazooie's <b>spanner</b> can also be used as a melee weapon outside of the vehicle, in addition to levitating lopsided vehicles. Banjo and Kazooie have limited attack power and agility on foot at first, but the duo can upgrade their speed, stamina and strength by visiting Boggy's gym in the game's hub world. Scattered around the game's six worlds are musical notes, which serve as currency for the player to purchase certain items such as blueprints, parts, and access to advanced vehicles. Musical notes vary in value as determined by its colour; gold, silver or bronze. Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts also features an online multiplayer; players can compete in challenges such as races and combat over Xbox Live. In addition, players can share their own vehicle designs and blueprints online.|$|E

40|$|Our article {{contributes}} {{to the understanding of}} the micro-foundations of dynamic capabilities by showing how middle managers adopting the role of boundary <b>spanners</b> influence the organizational capacities to sense/shape and seize opportunities. Organizations should constantly monitor their environment in order to detect and create opportunities. How such access, detection and creation actually occur still needs to be investigated. Boundary <b>spanners</b> are individuals with rare competencies who link the organization to its environment. They play an important role in knowledge transfer, diffusion and exploitation. They also influence innovation and organizational change. However, not all boundary <b>spanners</b> are equal when it comes to succeeding in these functions, sometimes despite high expertise and individual talent. Research has explored the characteristics and levers of performance of boundary <b>spanners.</b> As few studies have done, we propose to analyze how boundary <b>spanners</b> influence the important dynamic capabilities of sensing/shaping and seizing opportunities. From a qualitative study of a case of an inter-professional association on diversity management, four boundary spanning roles are identified in relation to the shaping/sensing and seizing of opportunities.

40|$|It is well {{established}} in the public management literature that boundary <b>spanners</b> – people or groups that work across departments or sectors – are {{critical to the success}} of whole of government and joined-up working. In studying recent unprecedented change to central government agencies in the Australian context, our research identified that intra-departmental boundary <b>spanners</b> also play a critical role in the functioning of government departments, particularly during restructuring. Although most contemporary literature in public management concentrates on boundaries across formal organisational entities (departments, agencies, sectors), boundaries also exist within departments. Our research has found that without dedicated intra-departmental boundary <b>spanners,</b> significant role confusion and dysfunctional practices arise. In turn, this has serious implications for the quality of policy advice given to Cabinet. Further research needs to be undertaken into both the role of intra-departmental boundary <b>spanners</b> and how to nurture and manage the practice of intra-departmental boundary <b>spanners.</b> This is especially the case if changes in Australia represent a fundamental shift more broadly in the way central government agencies operate...|$|R

25|$|In late 1952 Bristol {{made the}} {{surprise}} announcement {{that the car}} was to be redesigned as a two-seat sports car, for entry into the following year's Le Mans race. Over the following few months the G-type was comprehensively redesigned and rebuilt by Bristol's new motor sport department, with the design team led by David Summers. The chassis itself was founded on twin, oval-section rails running {{the length of the}} car, which were changed to simple circular-section members for the Bristol. To these, the G-Type's double wishbone front and de Dion tube rear suspension were attached. The wheelbase was relatively long at 8ft 1¼ in (247cm), especially considering the car's narrow track of 4ft 3 in (130cm). Inboard brakes at the rear and an innovative hub/rim arrangement reduced unsprung weight. These innovative wheels consisted of a large hub spider – through which driveshafts could be switched without needing to remove the wheels and brakes – to which a wheel consisting of little more than a rim was attached. For the 1955 Le Mans race, to save further time during pit stops, Bristol developed an equally innovative multi-barreled, powered <b>spanner,</b> which could remove all five wheel nuts simultaneously. In {{much the same way as}} for modern Formula One wheel changes, the <b>spanner</b> would then retain the wheel nuts and allow precise reattachment of the new wheel to the car, applying the correct amount of torque to each nut.|$|E
