50|$|Wayne Acoustic Guitars {{produced}} a spider bridge resonator guitar in the 1940s and 1950s in Australia. They were crudely {{made out of}} what {{was at the time}} cheap Australian timber using a tone ring rather than a tone well but their biggest problems were no neck reinforcement and a very different pressed (rather than <b>spun)</b> <b>cone.</b> This is often called a pillow cone due to the shapes pressed into the face to strengthen the cone. Many examples exist today and if the neck is straight and a good cone is used can give a reasonable sound. As of 2010, Don Morrison was producing highly regarded resonators under the Donmo brand name.|$|E

In this research {{and in order}} to improve <b>spinning</b> <b>cone</b> column design and predict tower capacity, the flooding limits, pressure drop, the effect of tray speed, cone spacing, flooding for both industrial and small scale operation have been assessed using artificial neural network. Furthermore, variation of gas and liquid flow rate in an industrial scale <b>spinning</b> <b>cone</b> column has also been studied. From {{the findings of this study}} and from the flooding graph obtained from this work, the <b>spinning</b> <b>cone</b> column capacity in different operating conditions could be estimated. The findings of this study reveal that the predictions of this work are much accurate than those obtained from the existing empirical correlation (about 10 %). There also exists a good compatibility between the predicted pressure drop values of the present study and the experimental data in both dry and wet state (MSE[*]=[*] 0.0021, MAE[*]=[*] 5 %, and NB[*]=[*]; 0.00232). Therefore, the findings of this study shows that the artificial neural nets technique with multilayer perceptron structure and Levenberg-Marquart training algorithm could be applied as a powerful tool and a cost and time effective way in predicting the <b>spinning</b> <b>cone</b> column capacity and the pressure drop.|$|R
50|$|The use of <b>spinning</b> <b>cones,</b> {{and other}} {{technologies}} such as reverse osmosis, was banned in the EU until recently, although for many years they could freely be used in wines imported into the EU from certain New World wine producing countries such as Australia and the USA. In November 2007, the Wine Standards Branch (WSB) of the UK's Food Standards Agency banned {{the sale of a}} wine called Sovio, made from Spanish grapes that would normally produce wines of 14% ABV. Sovio runs 40-50% of the wine over <b>spinning</b> <b>cones</b> to reduce the alcohol content to 8%, which means that under EU law it could not be sold as wine as it was below 8.5%; above that, under the rules prevailing at the time, it would be banned because <b>spinning</b> <b>cones</b> could not be used in EU winemaking.|$|R

5000|$|Improvements in {{viticulture}} and warmer vintages {{have led}} to increasing levels of sugar in wine grapes, which have translated {{to higher levels of}} alcohol - which can reach over 15% ABV in Zinfandels from California. Some producers feel that this unbalances their wine, and use <b>spinning</b> <b>cones</b> to reduce the alcohol by 1-2 percentage points. In this case the wine is passed through the column once to distill out the most volatile aroma compounds which are then put to one side while the wine goes through the column a second time at higher temperature to extract alcohol. The aroma compounds are then mixed back into the wine. Some producers such as Joel Peterson of Ravenswood argue that technological [...] "fixes" [...] such as <b>spinning</b> <b>cones</b> remove a sense of terroir from the wine; if the wine has the tannins and other components to balance 15% alcohol, Peterson argues that it should be accepted on its own terms.|$|R

50|$|In {{the context}} of wine production, terroir {{is a concept that}} {{encompasses}} the varieties of grapes used, elevation and shape of the vineyard, type and chemistry of soil, climate and seasonal conditions, and the local yeast cultures. The range of possible combinations of these factors can result in great differences among wines, influencing the fermentation, finishing, and aging processes as well. Many wineries use growing and production methods that preserve or accentuate the aroma and taste influences of their unique terroir. However, flavor differences are less desirable for producers of mass-market table wine or other cheaper wines, where consistency takes precedence. Such producers try to minimize differences in sources of grapes through production techniques such as micro-oxygenation, tannin filtration, cross-flow filtration, thin-film evaporation,and <b>spinning</b> <b>cones.</b>|$|R
