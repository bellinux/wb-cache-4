40|$|Amazon {{has been}} enjoying a rapid pace of {{growth over the}} last few years. One unfortunate side effect of this growth is the overall {{increased}} complexity of the network Amazon utilizes to deliver packages from the Amazon warehouses (coined "fulfillment centers" or "FCs") to the final customers. Specifically, Amazon now requires the outbound docks of the FCs to handle more volume that needs to be delivered to more locations. The increased number of outbound locations necessitates more package sorting operations on the dock. This thesis focuses on the operation of the outbound docks and performs time studies, capacity analyses, various warehouse case studies, and discrete event simulations to discover the ultimate bottleneck of a dock as more of these sorts are added. This <b>sorting</b> <b>capacity</b> analysis uncovers that the space available on a dock as an inventory buffer between the sorting and truck loading operations to ultimately be the source of constraint as more sorts are required from a building. This buffer constraint is then explored and quantified to create a mathematical formulation for estimating the ultimate outbound <b>sorting</b> <b>capacity</b> of an FC. Given the max <b>sorting</b> <b>capacity</b> of an FC, this thesis then dives in to the practical applications of operations management principles for executing on a sort plan. The principles of minimizing non-value added work, optimizing the number of packages going through the most labor efficient process paths, worker interference on labor efficiencies, and employing flexible capacity will be explored and applied to the outbound dock. by Matthew O.

To meet these high service levels, complex logistics networks need to be planned and operated. Such networks are typically divided into transportation of letters or parcels from customer locations to a local sorting terminal (collection), inter-terminal transportation, and transportation from a terminal to customer locations (delivery). Within postal logistics networks the interaction of processing at and transportation between different kinds of facilities plays a vital role. Normally, collection and initial sorting, as well as inter-terminal transportation and final sorting need to be finished before certain cut-off times. Thus, guaranteeing the subsequent transportation to start on time. The talk presents various optimization problems within {{the part of a}} postal logistics network where collection takes place.

40|$|The ErbB 2 {{receptor}} is a {{clinically validated}} cancer target whose internalization and trafficking mechanisms remain poorly understood. HSP 90 inhibitors, such as geldanamycin (GA), {{have been developed}} to target the receptor to degradation or to modulate downstream signaling. Despite intense investigations, the entry route and postendocytic sorting of ErbB 2 upon GA stimulation have remained controversial. We report that ErbB 2 levels inversely impact cell clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) capacity. Indeed, the high levels of the receptor are responsible for its own low internalization rate. GA treatment does not directly modulate ErbB 2 CME rate but it affects ErbB 2 recycling fate, routing the receptor to modified multivesicular endosomes (MVBs) and lysosomal compartments, by perturbing early/recycling endosome structure and <b>sorting</b> <b>capacity.</b> This activity occurs irrespective of the cargo interaction with HSP 90, as both ErbB 2 and the constitutively recycled, HSP 90 -independent, transferrin receptor are found within modified endosomes, and within aberrant, elongated recycling tubules, leading to modified MVBs/lysosomes.

40|$|Experimental and {{clinical}} studies often require highly purified cell populations. FACS {{is a technique}} of choice to purify cell populations of known phenotype. Other bulk methods of purification include panning, complement depletion and magnetic bead separation. However, FACS has several advantages over other available methods. FACS is the preferred method when very high purity of the desired population is required, when the target cell population expresses a very low level of the identifying marker or when cell populations require separation based on differential marker density. In addition, FACS is the only available purification technique to isolate cells based on internal staining or intracellular protein expression, such as a genetically modified fluorescent protein marker. FACS allows the purification of individual cells based on size, granularity and fluorescence. In order to purify cells of interest, they are first stained with fluorescently-tagged monoclonal antibodies (mAb), which recognize specific surface markers on the desired cell population (1). Negative selection of unstained cells is also possible. FACS purification requires a flow cytometer with <b>sorting</b> <b>capacity</b> and the appropriate software.

40|$|A public {{logistics}} network (PLN) {{was proposed}} {{as a means}} to allow multiple firms to cooperate in providing ground parcel transport. To support fast and flexible shipping, a PLN would require sorting in terminals. In this research, we address to find an upper bound on the terminal cost for a PLN system such that its total transport costs would be {{the same as that of}} the a private logistics network like UPS. The labor costs in current terminals are high because of lots of human handling [10]. In order to reduce high labor costs and provide efficient <b>sorting</b> <b>capacity,</b> we want to use automatic equipment in the PLN terminals. Since the biggest parcel delivery company, UPS, is a hub-and-spoke (HUB) transportation system, the total logistics network cost in a PLN should be higher than UPS’s. The total logistics network cost includes line-haul transportation cost, pick-up/delivery (P/D) routing cost, and terminal cost. By analyzing each cost in the logistics network, we define an upper bound terminal cost for a PLN based on a similar level of service with HUB. A hypothetical network of 36 terminals in the southeastern U. S. is used as an example PLN in the analysis. In the example, we observed that transportation cost in a PLN is lower than in a HUB, and the saving transportation cost of PLN contributes to among that can be spent on sorting equipment at the terminals. The upper bound sorting cost for whole hypothetical network is around $ 5 – 11 billion for 4 – 10 years. The average upper bound cost for each terminal is around $ 163 – 318 million for 4 – 10 years. According to the number of sorts need in the hypothetical network, the upper bound sorting cost per truck stop, $ 91, 832 – 179, 289, is offered to determine the size of terminals based on their sorting needs.
