50|$|Square and {{hexagonal}} wires were possibly {{made using}} a <b>swaging</b> <b>technique.</b> In this method a metal rod was struck between grooved metal blocks, or between a grooved punch and a grooved metal anvil. Swaging {{is of great}} antiquity, possibly dating {{to the beginning of}} the 2nd millennium BCE in Egypt and in the Bronze and Iron Ages in Europe for torcs and fibulae. Twisted square-section wires are a very common filigree decoration in early Etruscan jewelry.|$|E
40|$|Tubular inserts {{reinforce}} joints, reducing {{incidence of}} leaks. In new <b>swaging</b> <b>technique,</b> tubular inserts placed inside ends of both tubes to be joined. Made from thicker-wall tubing with outside diameter that matches inside diameter of thin tubing swaged, inserts support tube ends at joint. They ensure more uniform contact between swage fitting and tubing. New <b>swaging</b> <b>technique</b> developed for Al/Ti/V-alloy hydraulic supply lines...|$|E
40|$|Microstructures and tensile {{properties}} of commercial pure magnesium processed by rotary <b>swaging</b> (RS) <b>technique</b> were investigated. Bulk and gradient textures in the RS processed Mg were characterised byneutron and synchrotron diffractions, respectively. Grains of the pure Mg were gradually refined withincrease in the RS passes, which largely {{contributed to an}} increase in the tensile yield strength. A dominatedbasal fibre texture was observed in the RS processed pure Mg. Accommodated twinning deformationwas also observed. Both the optical observations and texture analyses through the diameter of theswaged rod showed a gradient evolution in microstructure...|$|R
25|$|As <b>swaging</b> is a <b>technique</b> {{in which}} cold metal is formed over a grooved tool or swage, {{the term was}} adopted {{in the field of}} {{automotive}} styling to describe when two panels were brought together, an edge of one panel was swaged so to overlap the other to create the impression of one continuous surface.|$|R
40|$|This {{study shows}} the {{possibility}} of processing titanium aluminide wires by cold deformation and annealing. An accumulative <b>swaging</b> and bundling <b>technique</b> is used to co-deform Ti and Al. Subsequently, a two step heat treatment is applied to form the desired intermetallics, which strongly depends on the ratio of Ti and Al in the final composite and therefore on the geometry of the starting composite. In a first step, the whole amount of Al is transformed to TiAl 3 by Al diffusion into Ti. This involves the formation of 12 % porosity. In a second step, the complete microstructure is transformed into the equilibrium state of -TiAl and TiAl 3. Using this approach, {{it is possible to}} obtain various kinds of gradient materials, since there is an intrinsic concentration gradient installed due to the <b>swaging</b> and bundling <b>technique,</b> but the processing of pure -TiAl wires is possible as well...|$|R
40|$|An {{accumulative}} <b>swaging</b> and bundling <b>technique</b> is used {{to prepare}} composite wires made of Ti and an Al alloy. These wires show reasonable higher yield stresses than expected from the pure material flow curves. The additional strengthening in the composite is analyzed using nanoindentation measurements, tensile testings and investigations of the microstructure. In addition, these properties are analyzed {{in relation to the}} fracture surface of the mechanically tested wires. Additional strengthening due to the presence of phase boundaries could be verified. Indications for residual stresses are found that cause a global hardness gradient from the center to the wire rim. Finally, the yield stress of the wires are calculated based on local hardness measurements...|$|R
