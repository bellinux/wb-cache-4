40|$|The Lincang {{germanium}} deposit, Yunnan, SW China, contains {{at least}} 1000  tonnes of Ge {{at an average}} grade of ~ 850  ppm Ge, {{and is one of}} the largest Ge deposits in the world. The deposit is hosted within coal seams of the Miocene Bangmai Formation, deposited on top of a Ge-rich granite batholith. The Bangmai Formation is divided into eight units among which three are coal-bearing. The Ge-bearing coal seams are inter-layered with siliceous rocks and <b>siliceous</b> <b>limestones</b> in the basal coal-bearing unit. The coal seams of the other two coal-bearing units are not interbedded with siliceous rocks and <b>siliceous</b> <b>limestones,</b> and are also barren with respect to Ge. Equant or elongate Ge-orebodies are generally located at fault intersections. Germanium is mainly associated with organic matter within the coal seams and is concentrated at the top and bottom of the coal seams, where the latter are in contact with the layered siliceous rocks or <b>siliceous</b> <b>limestones.</b> Major and trace element contents, and O- and C-isotopes of the siliceous rocks and <b>siliceous</b> <b>limestones,</b> are similar to those of hydrothermal sediments, indicating formation by hydrothermal sedimentation. Compared with barren coals, Ge-rich coals are notably rich in Nb, Li, Sb, W, Bi and U and show substantial enrichment of HREE which increase together with Ge. Germanium-rich coals contain disseminated pyrite with δ 34 S ranging from 17. 2 to 51. 4 ‰, similar to pyrite in barren coals, and thin vein-like pyrite with δ 34 S ranging from - 5. 4 to 1. 9 ‰, similar to sulfides in granite-related quartz veins. We propose that circulating hydrothermal fluids leached abundant Ge and other elements from Ge-rich granites in the basement, and were then discharged into the basin, mainly along fault intersections, to form layer-like siliceous rocks and <b>siliceous</b> <b>limestones</b> by depositing Si and Ca.

The thermal barrier on the liquidus associated with the congruent melting of lamite in the system CaO-SiO_ 2 is eliminated by solution of a few percent CO_ 2 at pressures greater than about 1 kbar; the CO_ 2 causes expansion of the liquidus fields for calcite and wollastonite until they meet and exclude both spurrite and lamite from the CO_ 2 -saturated liquidus field boundary.

The Calcare Selcifero di Fonzaso consists of pelagic <b>siliceous</b> <b>limestones</b> of Middle to Late Jurassic age for a total thickness of about 70 m. A 24 metres thick package of resedimented limestone is interstratified. This research is focused on the lowermost part, 9 metres thick, that mainly consists of red and green siliceous micrites with interbedded clay beds and abundant chert lenses and nodules. The studied interval lies between the lower member of the Rosso Ammonitico Veronese Formation below and the resedimented limestone above. The recovered radiolarian assemblages indicate a Callovian age for the base of the Calcare Selcifero di Fonzaso. Correlation with other sections of the Trento Plateau reveals a significant diachronism in siliceous sedimentation that we relate to highly irregular sea-bottom paleotopography. The base of siliceous deposits can be even older (Bathonian) on the eastern margin of the Trento Plateau, but younger (Oxfordian) on its western margin. The Callovian succession of the Belluno Trough consists of radiolarian-bearing micrite alternating with oolitic limestone.

Interpretation of laboratory phase equilibrium experiments is not always unambiguous. Experiments in small crucibles {{in the presence of}} water under pressure satisfied many petrologists that batholithic granites involved partial fusion of crustal rocks during the culmination of regional metamorphjsm. Then, the concept of subducted oceanic lithosphere provided a relatively high-silica source material for magma generation at mantle depths, and dehydration of the sinking slab provided water to lower the melting temperature of overlying mantle peridotite. Batholiths may include material derived from magmas whose genesis was initiated in all three environments. Phase equilibrium data are available to explore the melting products of subducted micaceous sediments and calcareous oozes trapped within basalt. <b>Limestones</b> or <b>siliceous</b> <b>limestones</b> could escape complete dissociation or melting to considerable depths, possibly for long-term storage in the mantle. Phase relationships in the system basalt-andesite-rhyolite-H_ 2 O through the pressure interval from depths where metamorphosed basaltic ocean crust melts, to the near-surface levels where batholiths are emplaced and andesites are erupted, is fundamental for understanding this magmatic system. On balance, the phase equilibrium data do not favor the concept of primary granite or tonalite from mantle or subducted crust. Primary water-undersaturated granite magma is a normal product of partial fusion of the crust, but temperatures of normal regional metamorphism are too low to generate tonalite liquids.

In contrast, regional sedimentary–diagenetic pyrites display a large variation of their 34 S values between - 45. 4 and + 9. 3. There is little evidence for significant modification of the hydrothermal fluid during deposition and the S isotope signatures suggest that the sulphur of the stibnite mineralization was not locally derived.
