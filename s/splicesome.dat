5000|$|Alternative {{splicing}} is {{a mechanism}} by which different forms of mature mRNAs (messengers RNAs) are generated from the same gene. It is a regulatory {{mechanism by which}} variations in the incorporation of the exons into mRNA leads {{to the production of}} more than one related protein, thus expanding possible genomic outputs. RBPs function extensively in the regulation of this process. Some binding proteins such as neuronal specific RNA-binding proteins, namely NOVA1, control the alternative splicing of a subset of hnRNA by recognizing and binding to a specific sequence in the RNA (YCAY where Y indicates pyrimidine, U or C). These proteins then recruit splicesomal proteins to this target site. SR proteins are also well known for their role in alternative splicing through the recruitment of snRNPs that form the <b>splicesome,</b> namely U1 snRNP and U2AF snRNP. However, RBPs are also part of the <b>splicesome</b> itself. The <b>splicesome</b> is a complex of snRNA and protein subunits and acts as the mechanical agent that removes introns and ligates the flanking exons. Other than core <b>splicesome</b> complex, RBPs also bind to the sites of Cis-acting RNA elements that influence exons inclusion or exclusion during splicing. These sites are referred to as exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs), exonic splicing silencers (ESSs), intronic splicing enhancers (ISEs) and intronic splicing silencers (ISSs) and depending on their location of binding, RBPs work as splicing silencers or enhancers [...]|$|E

50|$|The EJC {{is made up}} {{of several}} key protein {{components:}} RNPS1, Y14, SRm160, Aly/REF and Magoh, among others. RNPS1 can function as a coactivator of splicing, but along with Y14, it also takes part in the process of nonsense-mediated decay in eukaryotes. SRm160 is another coactivator that has been proposed to enhance mRNA 3â€™ end processing. The protein component Magoh is thought to facilitate the subcytoplasmic localization of mRNAs while Aly is engaged in nuclear mRNA export. Aly is believed to be recruited to the exon junction complex by the protein UAP56. UAP56 is recognized as an RNA helicase but acts as a splicing factor required for early <b>splicesome</b> assembly. Another factor involved in the EJC pathway is DEK. This component is known {{to take part in a}} variety of functions ranging from splicing to transcriptional regulation and chromatin structure.|$|E
50|$|The Dreyfuss Lab is {{interested}} in various projects studying the function and biogenesis of non-coding RNA and the proteins that interact with RNA. A primary research goal of the lab is to elucidate the function of Survival of Motor Neuron protein, SMN, which assembles a heptameric ring of Sm proteins on U snRNAs to form snRNPs that are essential components of the <b>splicesome.</b> Moreover, loss of functional SMN is directly linked to spinal muscular atrophy, a debilitating neurodegenerative disease that is characterize by the eventual death of motor neurons and muscular wasting. The Dreyfuss Lab is conducting research to understand the role of SMN in SMA pathology and using high throughput screening to discover potential therapeutics. The lab also studies the dynamic mechanism of RNA splicing, the RNA-binding proteins that determine exonic specificity, and snRNAs that are important regulators of splicing and mRNA maturation.|$|E
50|$|A {{splice site}} {{mutation}} is a genetic mutation that inserts, deletes or changes {{a number of}} nucleotides in the specific site at which splicing takes place during the processing of precursor messenger RNA into mature messenger RNA. Splice site consensus sequences that drive exon recognition are located at the very termini of introns. The deletion of the splicing site results {{in one or more}} introns remaining in mature mRNA and may lead to the production of abnormal proteins. When a splice site mutation occurs, the mRNA transcript possesses information from these introns that normally should not be included. Introns are supposed to be removed, while the exons are expressed. The mutation must occur at the specific site at which intron splicing occurs: within non-coding sites in a gene, directly next to the location of the exon. The mutation can be an insertion, deletion, frame shift, etc. The splicing process itself is controlled by the given sequences, known as splice-donor and splice-acceptor sequences, which surround each exon. Mutations in these sequences may lead to retention of large segments of intronic DNA by the mRNA, or to entire exons being spliced out of the mRNA. These changes could result in production of a nonfunctional protein. An intron is separated from its exon by means of the splice site. Acceptor-site and donor-site relating to the splice sites signal to the <b>splicesome</b> where the actual cut should be made. These donor sites, or recognition sites, are essential in the processing of mRNA. The average vertebrate gene consists of multiple small exons (average size, 137 nucleotides) separated by introns that are considerably larger.|$|E
40|$|The name of SR {{proteins}} {{is derived}} from their typical RS domain that is rich in serine (Ser, S) and arginine (Arg, R). They are conserved in evolution. Up to now, 10 members of the SR protein family {{have been identified in}} humans. SR proteins contain one or two RNA binding motifs aside from the RS domain, and also possess special biochemical and immunological features. As to the functions of SR proteins, they facilitate the recruitment of the components of <b>splicesome</b> via protein-protein interaction to prompt the assembly of early splicesome; while in alternative splicing, tissue-specifically expressed SR protein along with the relative ratio of SR protein and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) is composed of two main regulative mechanisms for alternative splicing. Almost all of the biochemical functions are regulated by reversible phosphorylation...|$|E
40|$|Splicing of mRNA {{precursors}} (pre-mRNA) is {{preceded by}} {{assembly of the}} pre-mRNA with small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) and protein factors to form a <b>splicesome.</b> Here we show that stimulating Ser/Thr-specific protein dephosphorylation selectively inhibits an early step during mammalian spliceosome assembly. Treatment of HeLa nuclear splicing extracts with human protein phosphatase 1 (PP 1) expressed in Escherichia coli, or PP 1 purified from rabbit skeletal muscle, prevents pre-spliceosome E complex (early complex) formation and stable binding of U 2 and U 4 /U 6. U 5 snRNPs to the pre-mRNA. PP 1 does not inhibit splicing catalysis if added after spliceosome assembly has taken place. Addition of purified SR protein splicing factors restores spliceosome formation and splicing to PP 1 -inhibited extracts, consistent with SR proteins being targets regulated by phosphorylation. These data extend earlier observations showing that splicing catalysis, but not spliceosome assembly, is blocked by inhibiting protein phosphatases. It therefore appears that pre-mRNA splicing, in common with other biological processes, can be regulated both positively and negatively by reversible protein phosphorylation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractGeneral mRNA {{processing}} {{factors are}} traditionally thought to function {{only in the}} control of global gene expression. Here we show that the Sm proteins, core components of the <b>splicesome,</b> also regulate germ granules during early C. elegans development. Germ granules are large cytoplasmic particles that localize to germ cells and their precursors during embryogenesis of diverse organisms [1]. In C. elegans, germ granules, called P granules, are segregated to the germline precursor cells during embryogenesis by asymmetric cell division, and they remain in germ cells at all stages of development [2]. We found {{that at least some}} Sm proteins are components of P granules. Moreover, disruption of Sm activity caused defects in P granule localization to the germ cell precursors during early embryogenesis. In contrast, loss of other splicing factor activities had no effect on germ granule control in the embryo. These observations suggest that the Sm proteins control germ granule integrity and localization in the early C. elegans embryo and that this role is independent of pre-mRNA splicing. Thus, a highly conserved splicing factor may have been adapted to control both snRNP biogenesis and the localization of components important for germ cell function...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSm and Sm-like {{proteins}} are core {{components of}} the <b>splicesome</b> but have other functions distinct from pre-mRNA processing. Here, we show that Sm proteins also regulate germ cell specification during early C. elegans embryogenesis. SmE and SmG were required to maintain transcriptional quiescence in embryonic germ cell precursors. In addition, depletion of SmE inhibited expression of the germ lineage-specific proteins PIE- 1, GLD- 1, and NOS- 2, but did not affect maintenance of several maternal mRNAs. PIE- 1 had previously been shown to activate transcriptional silencing and NOS- 2 expression. We found that PIE- 1 also promotes GLD- 1 expression by {{a process that is}} independent of transcriptional silencing. Thus, Sm proteins could control transcriptional silencing and maternal protein expression by regulating PIE- 1. However, loss of SmE function also caused defects in P granule localization and premature division in early germline blastomeres, processes that are independent of PIE- 1 function. Therefore, the Sm proteins control multiple aspects of germ cell precursor development. Because depletion of several other core splicing factors did not affect these events, these Sm functions are likely distinct from pre-mRNA splicing. Sm family proteins assemble into ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) that control RNA activities. We suggest that novel Sm RNPs directly or indirectly influence posttranscriptional control of maternal mRNAs to promote germ cell specification in the early C. elegans embryo...|$|E
40|$|The {{eukaryotic}} genome is {{a mosaic}} of eubacterial and archaeal genes {{in addition to those}} unique to itself. The mosaic may have arisen as the result of two prokaryotes merging their genomes, or from genes acquired from an endosymbiont of eubacterial origin. A third possibility is that the eukaryotic genome arose from successive events of lateral gene transfer over long periods of time. This theory does not exclude the endosymbiont, but questions whether it is necessary to explain the peculiar set of eukaryotic genes. We use phylogenetic studies and reconstructions of ancestral first appearances of genes on the prokaryotic phylogeny to assess evidence for the lateral gene transfer scenario. We find that phylogenies advanced to support fusion can also arise from a succession of lateral gene transfer events. Our reconstructions of ancestral first appearances of genes reveal that the various genes that make up the eukaryotic mosaic arose at different times and in diverse lineages on the prokaryotic tree, and were not available in a single lineage. Successive events of lateral gene transfer can explain the unusual mosaic structure of the eukaryotic genome, with its content linked to the immediate adaptive value of the genes its acquired. Progress in understanding eukaryotes may come from identifying ancestral features such as the eukaryotic <b>splicesome</b> that could explain why this lineage invaded, or created, the eukaryoticniche...|$|E
30|$|In practice, {{for many}} {{macromolecular}} complexes that exhibit heterogeneity with dynamic conformations and thereby an infinite conformational states, the above classification methods may {{not produce a}} good result. A typical scenario is that the macromolecular complex comprises a number of stable modules (such as domains, subunits, or sub-complexes) that can be treated as rigid bodies, the overall flexibility of the complex {{is due to the}} dynamic slight fluctuations of the relative orientations and positions between rigid modules. In these cases, the conventional SPA approach will yield a 3 D reconstruction with smeared densities (i.e. a decreased resolution) because SPA approach assumes that all the particles within a class have an identical structure while this is not correct for such flexible complexes and the assigned parameters could be inaccurate for all of the modules. In addition, conventional classification approaches are also not able to classify the infinite continuous conformations of the complex into a finite number of discrete states with enough homogeneity within a class. Examples for these kinds of macromolecular complexes include the ribosome containing two subunits with relative motion (Bai et al., 2013) and the <b>splicesome</b> with substantial flexibility among subunits that is still poorly resolved by cryo-EM SPA approach (Azubel et al., 2004). Besides developing new sample preparation and freezing procedures to reduce the flexibility and heterogeneity, there is a great need of new image-processing algorithms to adequately treat the dynamic conformation problem.|$|E
40|$|Carcinoma of the uterine cervix is {{a common}} {{malignancy}} among women that {{has been found to}} show loss of heterozygosity in the chromosome 11 p. Recent studies have localized the TSG 101 gene in this region, and also demonstrated a high frequency of abnormalities of this gene in human breast cancer. To determine the role of the TSG 101 gene in the carcinogenesis of cervical and uterine carcinoma, 19 cases of cervical carcinoma and five cases of endometrial carcinoma, as well as nearby non-cancerous tissue from the same patients, and 16 blood samples from healthy persons as normal control were analysed by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA, reverse transcription of the TSG 101 mRNA followed by PCR amplification and sequencing of the products. We found that abnormal transcripts of the TSG 101 gene were common both in cancerous or non-cancerous tissues of the uterus and cervix and in normal peripheral mononuclear cells. There was no genomic deletion or rearrangement in spite of the presence of abnormal transcripts, and no definite relationship between the abnormal transcripts and HPV infection was found. Although the frequency of abnormal transcripts was higher in cancerous than in non-cancerous tissue, normal peripheral mononuclear cells also had abnormal transcripts. Given these findings, the role of the TSG 101 gene as a tumour-suppressor gene should be re-evaluated. Because some aberrant transcripts could be found at the first PCR reaction, we suggest that the aberrant transcripts might be the result of imperfect minor <b>splicesome</b> products.

40|$|Increasing {{studies have}} shown that mature {{spermatozoa}} contain many transcripts including mRNAs and miRNAs. However, the expression profile of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in mammalian sperm has not been systematically investigated. Here, we used highly purified RNA to investigate lncRNA expression profiles in mouse mature sperm by stranded-specific RNA-seq. We identified 20, 907 known and 4, 088 novel lncRNAs transcripts, and the existence of intact lncRNAs was confirmed by RT-PCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization on two representative lncRNAs. Compared to round spermatids, 1, 794 upregulated and 165 downregulated lncRNAs and 4, 435 upregulated and 3, 920 downregulated mRNAs were identified in sperm. Based on the "Cis and Trans" RNA-RNA interaction principle, we found 14, 259 targeted coding genes of differently expressed lncRNAs. In terms of Gene ontology (GO) analysis, differentially expressed lncRNAs targeted genes mainly related to nucleic acid metabolic, protein modification, chromatin and histone modification, heterocycle compound metabolic, sperm function, spermatogenesis and other processes. In contrast, differentially expressed transcripts of mRNAs were highly enriched for protein metabolic process and RNA metabolic, spermatogenesis, sperm motility, cell cycle, chromatin organization, heterocycle and aromatic compound metabolic processes. Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed that the differentially expressed lncRNAs were involved in RNA transport, mRNA surveillance pathway, PI 3 K-Akt signaling pathway, AMPK signaling pathway, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum. Metabolic pathways, mRNA surveillance pathway, AMPK signaling pathway, cell cycle, RNA transport <b>splicesome</b> and endocytosis incorporated with the differentially expressed mRNA. Furthermore, many lncRNAs were specifically expressed in testis/sperm, and 880 lncRNAs were conserved between human and mouse. In summary, this study provides a preliminary database valuable for identifying lncRNAs critical in the late stage of spermatogenesis or important for sperm function regulation, fertilization and early embryo development...|$|E
40|$|Mitogen-activated {{protein kinase}} (MAPK) cascades are the conserved and {{universal}} signal transduction modules in all eukaryotes, which play the vital roles in plant growth, development {{and in response}} to multiple stresses. In this study, we used bioinformatics methods to identify 86 MAPKKK protein encoded by 73 MAPKKK genes in Brachypodium. Phylogenetic analysis of MAPKKK family from Arabidopsis, rice and Brachypodium has classified them into three subfamilies, of which 28 belonged to MEKK, 52 to Raf and 6 to ZIK subfamily respectively. Conserved protein motif, exon-intron organization and splicing intron phase in kinase domains supported the evolutionary relationships inferred from the phylogenetic analysis. And gene duplication analysis suggested the chromosomal segment duplication happened before the divergence of the rice and Brachypodium, while all of three tandem duplicated gene pairs happened after their divergence. We further demonstrated that the MAPKKKs have evolved under strong purifying selection, implying the conservation of them. The splicing transcripts expression analysis showed that the <b>splicesome</b> translating longest protein tended to be adopted. Furthermore, the expression analysis of BdMAPKKKs in different organs and development stages as well as heat, virus and drought stresses revealed that the MAPKKK genes were involved in various signaling pathways. And the circadian analysis suggested there were 41 MAPKKK genes in Brachypodium showing cycled expression in at least one condition, of which seven MAPKKK genes expressed in all conditions and the promoter analysis indicated these genes possessed many cis-acting regulatory elements involved in circadian and light response. Finally, the co-expression network of MAPK, MAPKK and MAPKKK in Brachypodium was constructed using 144 microarray and RNA-seq datasets, and ten potential MAPK cascades pathway were predicted. To conclude, our study provided the important information for evolutionary and functional characterization of MAPKKK family in Brachypodium, which will facilitate the functional analysis of BdMAPKKK genes, and also will facilitate better understanding the MAPK signal pathway in Brachypodium and beyond...|$|E
40|$|The U 4 /U 6. U 5 tri-snRNP {{is a key}} {{component}} of spliceosomes. By using chemical reagents and RNases, we performed the first extensive experimental analysis of the structure and accessibility of U 4 and U 6 snRNAs in tri-snRNPs. These were purified from HeLa cell nuclear extract and Saccharomyces cerevisiae cellular extract. U 5 accessibility was also investigated. For both species, data demonstrate the formation of the U 4 /U 6 Y-shaped structure. In the human tri-snRNP and U 4 /U 6 snRNP, U 6 forms the long range interaction, that was previously proposed to be responsible for dissociation of the deproteinized U 4 /U 6 duplex. In both yeast and human tri-snRNPs, U 5 is more protected than U 4 and U 6, suggesting that the U 5 snRNP-specific protein complex and other components of the tri-snRNP wrapped the 5 ' stem-loop of U 5. Loop I of U 5 is partially accessible, and chemical modifications of loop I were identical in yeast and human tri-snRNPs. This reflects a strong conservation of the interactions of proteins with the functional loop I. Only some parts of the U 4 /U 6 Y-shaped motif (the 5 ' stem-loop of U 4 and helix II) are protected. Due to difference of protein composition of yeast and human tri-snRNP, the U 6 segment linking the 5 ' stem-loop to the Y-shaped structure and the U 4 central single-stranded segment are more accessible in the yeast than in the human tri-snRNP, especially, the phylogenetically conserved ACAGAG sequence of U 6.

40|$|Candida albicans is a {{commensal}} fungus in humans, but {{can cause}} infections with high mortality rates. Cell proliferation and differentiation between yeast and hyphae {{are important for}} virulence and survival in the host. An understanding of their regulation may reveal new targets for therapeutic strategies. My work aimed to elucidate the regulation of mitosis in C. albicans, a poorly understood process, and focussed on characterizing the roles of a Polo-like kinase (Plk), Cdc 5 p. Plks are critical regulators of many aspects of mitosis in diverse organisms. Previous work demonstrated that depleting Cdc 5 p in C. albicans yeast resulted in a block in spindle elongation and mitosis, followed by formation of filaments and expression of hyphal-specific virulence genes, under yeast growth conditions. However, the mechanisms underlying Cdc 5 p function, mitotic progression, formation of novel filaments and expression of virulence genes, remained unclear. In order to address these questions, I first investigated a putative Cdc 5 p target, the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C). In Chapter 2, I showed that APC/C co-activators Cdc 20 p and Cdh 1 p had some conservation in mitotic function, and may lie downstream of Cdc 5 p. However, additional novel features suggest variations in the mitotic circuitry. I next investigated {{the identity of the}} Cdc 5 p-depleted filaments, since this was controversial. We hypothesized that the cells were elongated yeast buds that failed to switch from polar to isometric growth, but adapted a hyphal fate over time due to maintenance of polarized growth. In Chapter 3, time course assays demonstrated that hyphal-diagnostic features emerged in Cdc 5 p-depleted filaments at only later growth stages, in agreement with our hypothesis. Our results expand on the strategies that C. albicans can utilize to modulate growth and virulence determinants. I further addressed the mechanisms of Cdc 5 p function during mitosis and morphogenesis in Chapter 4 by screening for interacting factors. I discovered a novel, Candida-specific factor, CPI 1 (C. albicans Plk-interacting protein), which was not essential for growth but required to maintain mitotic arrest and may interact with the <b>splicesome.</b> Collectively, the work enhances our knowledge of mitotic regulation in C. albicans, and underscores variations in the regulatory circuitry that have important implications for controlling growth...|$|E
40|$|Significant {{progresses}} {{have been}} made in genetic research in MDS. Through RNA interference technology, knockdown of RPS 14 recapitulated the pathological process of decreased erythropoiesis [1]. Transgenic expression of RPS 14 in 5 q- MDS cells rescued the phenotype of insufficient erythropoiesis. This strongly suggests that haploinsufficiency of RPS 14 is one of the molecular mechanisms in the pathogenesis of 5 q- MDS. SF 3 B 1 is a core component of RNA <b>splicesome</b> and involved in the regulation of the mitochondrial pathway. In a study of 533 patients (pts) with MDS, 150 (28. 1 %) was found to have SF 3 B 1 gene mutation, which has a positive predictive value of 97. 7 % for RARS and correlates well with better overall survival (OS) and lower risk for AML transformation [2, 3]. Hypomethylating therapy represents a significant milestone in myelodysplasia (MDS) management. TET 2, IDH 1 / 2, and DNMT 3 A are regulators of DNA methylation [4]. EZH 2 and UTX were found {{to be involved in the}} histone H 3 K 26 and H 3 K 27 methylation. ASX 1 was found to be deleted in 11 - 15 % of MDS pts. In a study of 88 pts with MDS, mutations of DNMT 3 A, IDH 1 / 2, and TET 2 were found to be correlated with responses to azacytidine /decitabine(64 % in mutated vs 35 % wild type, P= 0. 01) [5]. microRNA- 21 may also serve as a biomarker for therapy response to hypomethylating agents in MDS. In a study of 63 pts, lower level of serum miR- 21 correlated with higher PFS and OS (p 0. 003 and 0. 001, respectively) [6]. In terms of therapy, azacytidine (75 mg /m 2 x 5) was studied in combination with lenalidomide (10 mg x 21) in 36 refractory pts (IPSS=> 1. 5). Overall response rate (ORR) was 71 % (CR 40, PR 31) [7]. Azacytidine (75 mg /m 2 x 5) was also studied in combination with vorinostat (200 mg TID x 5) in 30 untreated MDS pts with poor clinica...|$|E
40|$|We are {{developing}} an alternative therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) using antisense oligonucleotides (AO) to displace factors {{involved in the}} normal splicing of the dystrophin exons during pre-mRNA processing. Masking selected motifs involved in splicing prevents normal <b>splicesome</b> assembly so that specific exons are omitted from the mature mRNA along with the flanking introns. In this manner, an exon containing a nonsense mutation could be by-passed {{as long as the}} reading frame was not disrupted. The most common type of mutations in the dystrophin gene are genomic deletions of one or more exons which disrupt the reading frame. Specific removal of one or more exons flanking the genomic deletions could restore the reading frame. The dystrophin gene should be a most amenable target for this type of AO approach as it has been well established that the complete dystrophin protein is not required for near normal activity. A milder allelic version of DMD, Becker Muscular Dystrophy, arises from in-frame deletions in the dystrophin gene, which allows synthesis of a shorter but still functional protein. Furthermore, dystrophin-positive revertant fibres, which arise from some naturally occurring exon skipping mechanism, have been detected in dystrophic tissue of many DMD patients and animal models of the disease. The mdx mouse model of muscular dystrophy carries a nonsense mutation in exon 23 of the dystrophin gene. AO-induced removal of this exon will by-pass the premature termination codon without disrupting the reading frame so that a dystrophin protein missing only 71 amino acids can be produced. Refinement of AO design and targeting has resulted in high levels of induced exon 23 skipping in the induced dystrophin mRNA, thereby restoring dystrophin synthesis in transfected cultured cells. In vivo administration through intramuscular injection of AOs into the tibialis anterior of mdx mice has resulted in strong and sustained dystrophin expression with correct sub-sarcolemmal localization. AO treated muscle shows significant improvement in muscle strength over untreated dystrophic mdx muscle after as few as a two injections of 1 ug AO:liposome complex. Other AO chemistries (morpholino and peptide nucleic acids) {{can also be used to}} displace splicing factors. These have uncharged backbones and, although very resistant to nuclease degradation, have been limited by poor cellular/nuclear uptake. We have annealed sense-strand oligonucleotide leashes to the uncharged AO to allow complex formation with cationic liposomes. Although the PNA:leash:liposome complex was unable to induce any exon skipping, the morpholino AO:leash:liposome complex induced exon skipping at concentrations more than three orders of magnitude lower than other groups have demonstrated antisense effects with uncomplexed morpholino AOs in cultured cells...|$|E
40|$|Preimplantation embryo {{development}} in the mouse {{is a time of}} rapid cellular morphological and molecular changes leading to embryo implantation for the generation of offspring. The Mager lab studies these events occuring between fertilization and implantation in order to better understand the initial events which set the stage for all future aspects of development. The result of this research impacts many scientific disciplines including in-vitro based means of embryo culture, establishment of epigenetic marks, differentiation and cellular reprogramming and can be used in translational research for the improvement of in-vitro culture techniques and develop novel therapies such as cell replacement in the case of macular degeneration (Bin, L., 2009). Through the use of in-vitro embryo culture, RNA interference (RNAi) approaches and daily observations, gene function required in preimplantation {{embryo development}} can be determined. In the initial published body of work evaluating gene knockdown using our RNAi approach (Maserati M 2011), WDR 74 was characterized in preimplantation embryo development. We now understand that WDR 74 is implicated in RNA production and/or stability as gene knockdown at the 1 cell stage significantly depletes mRNA within the embryo by the morula stage. Furthermore, double knockdown of Trp 53 and Wdr 74 results in a partial rescue of blastocyst formation suggesting p 53 mediated apoptosis in the failure to make a blastocyst phenotype. The initial characterization of 4 RNA processing genes (SF 3 b 14, SF 3 b 1 /SAP 155, Rpl 7 l 1 and Rrp 7 a) required for blastocyst formation was later evaluated. The results of this work has been submitted for publication and will be published soon in the journal Zygote. SF 3 b 14 and SF 3 b 1, identified as being part of the <b>splicesome</b> complex, disproportionally contributes to gene transcription of those genes containing more than 1 exon verifying a role in RNA splicing. Rpl 7 l 1, identified by GO terms as a possible ribosomal gene, was found to be present in the cytoplasm and, surprisingly, in the nucleus. It is surmised this gene influences polymerase 2 activity as Rpl 7 l 1 gene knockdown embryos demonstrate reduced active polymerase 2 activity at the morula stage. Rrp 7 a was identified as being critical in blastocyst formation and is present in the cytoplasm while excluded from the nucleus. Based on location and GO terms, this suggests a role in translation. Taken together, these 4 genes act in 3 different ways impacting RNA production, splicing or translation promoting blastocyst formation in the mouse. The final gene evaluated in this work was Bcl- 6 corepressor (Bcor). As opposed to our previous work with RNA processing factors, this gene knockdown does not result in a failure to make a blastocyst. Bcor knockdown increases the rate of physiologically normal blastocysts in both murine and bovine models. Although further characterization must be done, temporary Bcor gene knockdown might be a useful improvement of in-vitro embryo culture systems including murine, bovine, equine and possibly even human. This manuscript is divided into 4 chapters, the first of which is a review of preimplantation embryo development. This covers selected and relevant events between fertilization and just before implantation of the embryo into the uterus. I mainly focus on events after fertilization and the necessary changes required for zygotic genome transcription and lineage specification. The second chapter characterizes WDR 74, a gene we identified as critical in the formation of a blastocyst in a reverse genetic screen. As state before, we assess WDR 74 function with the developing embryo and conclude the protein plays a role in RNA production and/or stability of RNA transcripts. We also test to rescue blastocyst formation in WDR 74 knockdown embryos in an attempt to further evaluate WDR 74 function. We continue the characterization of genes whose temporary reduction causes the failure of blastocyst formation in the third chapter. Here we report on four additional RNA processing genes in a body of work which has been published in the journal Zygote. Since these genes contained similar GO terms, we assumed they may all function in a similar way so they were assayed together as a group. As function of these genes were unknown, we determined protein localization within the cell, function in RNA splicing, alternative splicing and to determine if the failure to make a blastocyst is due to lineage specification. In the final chapter, BCOR gene expression is characterized in preimplantation embryo development as in the former 2 chapters. However, the result of this gene knockdown does not lead to the failure to make a blastocyst, rather this improves the number of blastocysts formed during the correct physiological time; the same time that blastocysts form invivo. Undoubtedly, this could lead to possible commercial applications which are reviewed along with the preliminary data {{we have been able to}} collect thus far. Specifically, the continuation of the BCOR gene knockdown research in preimplantation embryo development is pitched in the form of academic and international business collaboration with InvitroBrasil for the production of cloned bovine, equine and ICSI in equine...|$|E
