40|$|The {{motivation}} for the study {{is to examine the}} effects of several trends on the IT workforce. The purpose of the study is to understand several key mid-level roles in IT client organizations, which are gaining importance for organizations as they employ alternative sourcing arrangements. Mid-level positions, such as project manager, <b>senior</b> <b>system</b> <b>analyst,</b> relationship manager and system architect, continue to be in demand in the organizations we study. Organizations use these roles to design solutions and coordinate their delivery. They also use these roles as a way to allow up-and-coming talent to demonstrate their leadership and problem-solving capabilities. Employees view these roles as an important opportunity to extend their knowledge and skills and to use their experience as a stepping stone toward a management career. This study is intent on better understanding the characteristics, traits and motivations of those who successfully fill these positions and identifying best practices for organizations to identify, develop and retain personnel to fill these roles. Justification for our topic and approach, along with preliminary results, are presented for this work-in-progress...|$|R

50|$|The {{system was}} {{introduced}} in 1982 in Europe, and was first used in the USA by Mobil in 1986. Paul Luthra, who had graduated {{at the top of}} his class at National Institute of Technology, Kashmir with subsequent graduate degrees from XLRI- Xavier School of Management and the William E. Simon Graduate School of Business Administration, was working for Ponderosa Steakhouse and Bonanza Steakhouse in Dayton, Ohio as a <b>Senior</b> <b>Systems</b> <b>Analyst.</b> On a rainy day in 1978, his manager and mentor Bill Fessler (a graduate of Miami University) stopped at a gas station. Paul watched Bill from the car and noticed the two trips to the cashier hut. At that moment, with the mind-set of a time and motion engineer, Paul saw that an application of ATM technology at the pumps would make it convenient and quicker to buy gas. Banks had recently adopted the ATM technology. He shared his thoughts with Bill. Subsequently Bill Fessler changed jobs and joined Mobil, got funded to the tune of $3 million for research and development and got the system implemented. The system allows customers the convenience of not having to walk far from their vehicle, wait in line, or wait for the human station attendant to process the transaction. It also provides the attendants the advantage of being able to tend to other duties rather than being busy with customers. Only 13 percent of convenience stores had the technology by 1994, but 80 percent of U.S. convenience stores used the technology by 2002, and virtually all stores do today. In 2004, Sheetz was the first to use touch-screen kiosks by the pump where customers can also order in-store foodservice items that they pick up after fueling.In 2012 Zarco USA was the first to have ordering touch screens on the pump.|$|E

A major source for the report was NSA senior officer Thomas Andrews Drake. Drake had been complaining to his superiors for some time about problems at the agency, and about the superiority of ThinThread over Trailblazer, for example, at protecting privacy. Drake gave info to DoD during its investigation of the matter. Roark also went to her boss at the House committee, Porter Goss, about problems, but was rebuffed. She also attempted to contact William Rehnquist, the Supreme Court Chief Justice at the time.|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify the relative importance of selected skills that a <b>systems</b> <b>analyst</b> may need when performing systems development tasks and the relative importance of the systems development tasks as perceived by practicing <b>systems</b> <b>analysts.</b> The impact of selected dimensions of the system development environment was also investigated by evaluating the importance of skills within different system development contexts. A survey was sent to a national sample of organizations and 134 <b>systems</b> <b>analysts</b> from 77 different organizations participated in the study. The participating <b>systems</b> <b>analysts</b> were asked to rate the relative importance of 35 selected <b>systems</b> <b>analyst</b> tasks. The <b>systems</b> <b>analysts</b> rated the tasks on a 5 -point scale from "very important" to "very unimportant. " The respondents were instructed to rate the importance of the tasks by considering how each task aided them in successfully developing and maintaining computerized information systems at their organization. After rating the 35 tasks, the <b>systems</b> <b>analysts</b> were asked to rank the relative importance of four skill categories for each task. The four skill categories assessed were interpersonal skills, technical skills, analytical skills, and communication skills. The <b>systems</b> <b>analysts</b> ranked the four skill categories for each of the 35 activities from 1 to 4. For each task, every skill category received a unique ranking. The skill category rankings were weighted by the individual task ratings to determine an overall weighted skill category ranking. The overall weighted skill category rankings were grouped and analyzed based on four dimensions of the systems analysts' typical system development environment. The size of the system developed, the interpersonal environment in which the system was developed, the reason for undertaking a system project, and the individual who typically initiates system projects were assessed to determine their impact on the relative importance of each of the four skill categories. The results showed that regardless of the dimensions of the system development environment, analytical skills were consistently ranked the most important skill by the <b>systems</b> <b>analysts.</b> Although the computed average weighted ranking for technical skills was higher than communication skills, the rankings for these two skill categories were statistically equivalent. Interpersonal skills were consistently ranked last...|$|R
