5|$|An earth {{structure}} is a building or other structure made largely from soil. Since <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> a widely available material, {{it has been}} used in construction since prehistoric times.|$|E
5000|$|Salty (saline) <b>soils</b> <b>are</b> <b>soils</b> {{that have}} a high salt content. The {{predominant}} salt is normally sodium chloride (NaCl, [...] "table salt"). Saline <b>soils</b> <b>are</b> therefore also sodic soils but there may <b>be</b> sodic <b>soils</b> that <b>are</b> not saline, but alkaline.|$|R
30|$|AMF {{community}} {{composition in}} EXO and NAT <b>soils</b> <b>were</b> dissimilar. Available phosphorus, diversity index, spore abundance, and species richness {{were the main}} factors differing between the EXO and NAT soils. In general, the most dominant order present in the <b>soils</b> <b>were</b> Glomerales (44.8 %) and Gigasporales (41.4 %). The most abundant AMF genus in all studied <b>soils</b> <b>was</b> Funneliformis.|$|R

5|$|In 1836, native Vermonter John Deere set {{out from}} Rutland, Vermont to Grand Detour, Illinois, founded by his friend and fellow Vermont native Leonard Andrus. The town lacked a local blacksmith, Deere's trade, and within two days Deere had a forge and new {{business}} established. In Vermont, Deere produced plows made from cast-iron and when he first arrived in Illinois he produced the same plows. Soil conditions in Illinois differ from those in Vermont. In Vermont the <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> sandy and falls easily away from the plow blade but in Illinois the <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> thicker and wetter; it stuck to the plow {{and had to be}} scraped off by the farmer as he plowed.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{quantities}} of Sarawak soil are lithosols, up to 60 percent, and podsols, around 12 percent, while abundant alluvial <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> found in coastal and riverine regions. 12 percent of Sarawak {{is covered with}} peat swamp forest.|$|E

30|$|The {{collected}} bulk <b>soils</b> <b>were</b> air-dried spreading on a {{sheet of}} paper. The air-dried sample was then broken by crushing it gently using a wooden hammer, mixed thoroughly and were passed through 2 -mm sieve. The processed <b>soil</b> <b>was</b> used for plant growth.

30|$|<b>Soil</b> <b>was</b> {{randomly}} {{collected from}} the Teaching and Research Farm, Modibbo Adama University of Technology, Yola from the depth zone of 0 – 20  cm using a spade. <b>Soil</b> samples <b>were</b> bulked into composite sample.

5|$|The {{hills of}} Darjeeling {{are part of}} the Lesser Himalaya. The <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> chiefly {{composed}} of sandstone and conglomerate formations, which are the solidified and upheaved detritus of the great range of Himalaya. However, the <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> often poorly consolidated (the permeable sediments of the region do not retain water between rains) and is not considered suitable for agriculture. The area has steep slopes and loose topsoil, leading to frequent landslides during the monsoons. According to the Bureau of Indian Standards, the town falls under seismic zone-IV, (on a scale of I to V, in order of increasing proneness to earthquakes) near the convergent boundary of the Indian and the Eurasian tectonic plates and is subject to frequent earthquakes.|$|E
5|$|The main soils in the {{watershed}} of Messers Run are the Leck Kill soil and the Hazleton soil. The Leck Kill soil {{occurs in the}} northwestern part of {{the watershed}} (in its lower reaches). The Hazleton <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> found {{throughout the rest of}} the watershed.|$|E

30|$|The <b>soil</b> samples <b>were</b> air dried at room {{temperature}} (25 ± 2 °C) for one week. <b>Soils</b> <b>were</b> ground and passed through a 1.0 mm stainless steel sieve {{in order to improve}} the homogeneity of the soil.

50|$|Alkali, or alkaline, <b>soils</b> <b>are</b> clay <b>soils</b> {{with high}} pH (> 8.5), a poor soil {{structure}} {{and a low}} infiltration capacity. Often they have a hard calcareous layer at 0.5 to 1 metre depth. Alkali soils owe their unfavorable physico-chemical properties mainly to the dominating presence of sodium carbonate, which causes the soil to swell and difficult to clarify/settle. They derive their name from the alkali metal group of elements, to which sodium belongs, and which can induce basicity. Sometimes these <b>soils</b> <b>are</b> {{also referred to as}} alkaline sodic soils.Alkaline <b>soils</b> <b>are</b> basic, but not all basic <b>soils</b> <b>are</b> alkaline.|$|R

According to the Bureau of Indian Standards, Coimbatore falls under the Class III/IV Seismic Zone, having experienced an earthquake of magnitude 6.0 on the Richter scale on February 8, 1900.|$|E
5|$|The <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> {{moistened}} {{so it will}} compact into {{a stable}} structure when packed into woven polypropylene or burlap sacks or tubes. Plastic mesh is sometimes used. Polypropylene (pp) sacks are most common, since they are durable when covered, cheap, and widely available.|$|E

5|$|Hamersley's <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> an {{infertile}} yellow-brown sand {{composed of}} fine to coarse quartz grains, with Tamala Limestone beneath. Locally known as Karrakatta Sand, {{it is almost}} certainly the leached remnants of coastal sand deposited by eolian processes in the late Pleistocene period, between 11,000 and 100,000 years ago. Below the sand are Paleozoic rocks of the Perth Basin. The sand contains an unconfined aquifer with large supplies of low-salinity potable groundwater which is recharged by rainfall.|$|E
5|$|Most of Carabane {{is covered}} in mangroves, forming an impassable jungle {{that can only be}} crossed in {{constructed}} passages. Mangroves are among the few species capable of adapting to the highly saline environment, where the quantity of oxygen in the <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> low. In recent decades there has been concern that the mangroves are less prevalent. There are various reasons for the degradation, including crustaceans and the unregulated exploitation of wood. Efforts have been made to safeguard the mangroves and to educate children about their importance.|$|E
5|$|Nepenthes rajah usually {{grows in}} open, grassy clearings on old land slips and flat ridge tops, {{particularly}} {{in areas of}} seeping ground water, where the <b>soil</b> <b>is</b> loose and permanently moist. Although these sites can receive very high rainfall, excess water drains away quickly, preventing the soil from becoming waterlogged. N. rajah can often be found growing in grassy undergrowth, especially among sedges.|$|E
5000|$|The term “duplex” {{is used in}} Australia for soils with {{contrasting}} texture between soil horizons, {{although such}} <b>soils</b> <b>are</b> found {{in other parts of}} the world. Duplex <b>soils</b> <b>are</b> also termed “texture contrast soils”.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Aiming {{to reduce}} {{herbicide}} leaching, “in situ ” adsorption of herbicide−micelle formulations to <b>soils</b> <b>was</b> explored. Sulfentrazone or metolachlor were solubilized in cationic micelles, and these herbicide−micelle formulations {{were applied to}} sandy and alluvial soils. Sulfentrazone adsorption to the <b>soils</b> <b>was</b> negligible; however, its adsorption via its solubilization in micelles and their adsorption to the <b>soil</b> <b>was</b> significant and in good agreement with the Freundlich and Langmuir models. Adsorption of solubilized herbicide to the sandy <b>soil</b> <b>was</b> higher than to the alluvial soil. The low ratio between the surfactant concentration and the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of the alluvial soil brought upon micelle decomposition and reduction in herbicide adsorption. Therefore, an optimized ratio between surfactant and <b>soil</b> CEC <b>was</b> chosen to maximize herbicide retention. Even upon adding relatively low loadings of surfactant (0. 075 − 0. 3 % w/w soil), herbicide leaching through the <b>soils</b> <b>was</b> significantly reduced (2 − 5 -fold) {{in comparison with the}} commercial formulations...|$|R
