40|$|Practical and {{theoretical}} {{results have been}} found concerning the use of global storage allocation for the instances of applied occurrences of an attribute. The practical results focus on the necessary and sufficient conditions to decide at evaluator construction time whether an evaluator can allocate the instances of an applied occurrence {{to a number of}} global variables, <b>stackes</b> and queues. Checking these conditions takes polynomial time for a simple multi-visit evaluator and exponential time for an absolutely non-circular evaluator. The theoretical results are concerned with the data structures that are required for the global storage allocation of the instances of applied occurrences in simple multi-X evaluators, where X € {pass, sweep, visit}. For this purpose, the general class of basic linear data structures is introduced.

40|$|Three effects {{related to}} the wide {{incidence}} angles in crosswell reflection imaging, phase shift at postcritical incidence angles, in-plane Fresnel zone effect, and wave stretch in image, were investigated separately with model studies. To isolate the above effects, crosswell data were modeled with both a ray tracing and a finite difference approach based on the acoustic wave equation. Phase shifts occur at postcritical incidence angles degrading the stacked (over incidence angle) reflection image. The Fresnel zone effect produces a misalignment of the wavelet peak without the phase shift. However, these misalignments do not degrade the stack quality significantly compared with the post-critical incidence angle effect. The wavelet stretch effect produced in the imaging operation (mapping or migration) broadens the bandwidth of the stacked reflections, but it also introduces a vertically and laterally variable wavelet due to the variable reflection incidence angle coverage of each <b>stacke</b> [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. One {{proves that}} each almost local-global semihereditary ring R has the stacked base {{property}} and is almost Bézout. More precisely, if M is a finitely presented module, its torsion part tM {{is a direct}} sum of cyclic modules where the family of annihilators is an ascending chain of invertible ideals. These ideals are invariants of M. Moreover M/tM is a projective module which is isomorphic to a direct sum of finitely generated ideals. These ideals allow to define a finitely generated ideal whose isomorphic class is an invariant of M. The idempotents and the positive integers defined by the rank of M/tM are invariants of M too. It follows that each semihereditary ring of Krull-dimension one or of finite character, in particular each hereditary ring, enjoys the stacked base property. These results was already proved for Prüfer domains by Brewer, Katz, Klinger, Levy and Ullery. It is also shown that every semihereditary Bézout ring of countable character is an elementary divisor ring. It is well-known {{for a long time}} that every Dedekind domain satisfies the <b>stacke...</b>|$|E
40|$|We present {{here the}} first results for present-day {{conditions}} of the ongoing implementation of water stables isotopes in {{the latest version of}} the ECHAM atmospheric general circulation model, ECHAM 6, enhanced by the JSBACH interactive land surface scheme (ECHAM 6 -wiso). Major changes with respect to its predecessor ECHAM 5 {{have to do with the}} treatment of shortwave radiative transfer, the development of a new surface albedo representation, a new aerosol climatology, the height of the model top, and a more complex representation of the land surface [1]. Besides, a new five-layer soil hydrology scheme can be used instead of the single soil moisture reservoir in ECHAM 5 /JSBACH [2]. Our first analyses of the ECHAM 6 -wiso results concentrate on a detailed comparison to the previous model release, ECHAM 5 -wiso, and potential improvements in simulating the water stable isotopes signal due to overall model enhancements. This study represents the first step of the incorporation of water stable isotope tracers in all components of the fully coupled Earth system model MPI-ESM.

40|$|Elasto-hydrodynamic {{lubricated}} (EHL) contacts can {{be found}} in various machine elements or systems, like rolling element bearings, cam followers or gear transmissions. The service life of these elements and systems are depending to some extent on the performance of EHL contacts. Today most tribological contacts are lubricated with the same type of lubricant throughout the entire service life. However operating conditions can change over the components service life and the contacts will therefore require different lubricant properties. In order to expend the service life of the component, the lubrication of the tribological contacts has to be optimized based on the current operating conditions. A future vision is to develop machine elements which can adopt to the actual operating condition, so called triboactive systems. A first step of necessary research in order to develop such systems is presented in this work. In order to enable operation dependent lubrication the mechanism of monitoring techniques and their interaction with different operating conditions have to be investigated. In this work the effect of surface topography, slide to roll ratio and additives on the running-in and the monitoring by contact impedance were studied. Characteristic dependences between the surface parameter Rq and the contact capacitance and between the surface parameter Rz and the contact resistance were found. Further tests with iron oxide (FE 3 O 4) contaminated bearings, monitored by vibration and acoustic emission were carried out. Premature failure due to iron oxide contamination is the most common problem for rolling element bearings operating in mining environment. Thereby the effect of iron oxide contamination on the vibration and acoustic emission monitoring for two different types of greases were investigated. It was found that a simple RMS analysis of the vibration and acoustic emission signals enables the detection of improvements of contaminated contacts by lubrication. Both vibration and acoustic emission from the investigated bearings were reduced by adding extreme pressure additives (EP) to the contaminated contacts. Monitoring of the lubrication condition is necessary to generate information about the current performance of the tribological contact. However, in order to improve the performance of tribological contacts by changes of the lubricant or additives, the effect of such additives on the lubrication condition and the performance of the tribological contact need to be studied more in detail. The presented running-in tests in this work showed that EP additives are only favourable in the very first stage of running-in. The advantage of EP additives for running-in increases with increased surface roughness and increased slide to roll ratio. Another advantage of EP additives was observed during the tests with iron oxide contaminants. The use of EP additives reduced the acoustic emissions of the tribological contact by 70 % and reduced the increase of surface roughness of the raceways by as much as 60 %. Furthermore the tests indicate a lower wear rate for contaminated EHL contacts lubricated with greases containing EP additives in comparison to plain grease without EP additives, in case of iron oxide contaminated EHL contacts.
