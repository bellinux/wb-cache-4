40|$|Survival {{analysis}} {{concerns the}} characterization or comparison {{of one or}} more distributions of the time to a well defined event. The log-rank test is the most common method used to compare the survival distributions of two samples. When data within the two groups are stratified according to some risk factors, then a stratified log-rank test is employed. Stratified analysis is a procedure used to compare outcomes in different groups {{while at the same time}} correcting for the effects of confounders. It is one way to ensure that important prognostic factors are equally distributed among different treatments. The ordinary log-rank test is known to be conservative when treatments have been assigned by a stratified design. The stratified log-rank test is valid even when the <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>strata</b> differ. Schoenfeld and Tsiatis modified the log-rank test with a variance adjustment reflecting the dependence <b>of</b> survival on <b>strata</b> <b>size.</b> Their method is shown to be more efficient than the ordinary stratified log rank test when the number <b>of</b> <b>strata</b> is large, and it remains valid when the censoring distributions differ across treatment groups. In this thesis, we investigate these three log-rank tests for survival analysis. The effect <b>of</b> the <b>stratum</b> <b>sizes</b> on each type of analysis is evaluated using simulated data. Our results show that the modified log rank test is beneficial for stratified survival analysis in most cases especially when there are large numbers <b>of</b> <b>strata</b> and the strata sizes get small. The statistical power of the modified log-rank test is relatively stable even with very small strata sizes and high strata effects. The public health relevance of this thesis is that the modified log-rank test we investigated and implemented using the R programming language provides an alternative and more efficient way to accommodate higher amounts of stratification in analyzing survival data. More efficient statistical methods indirectly have public health impact as such methods lead to analyses which better identify treatments, interventions or factors that influence health outcomes.

30|$|The {{conventional}} {{sampling method}} is UTSM {{which is based}} on equal time interval sampling. Although the amount of data can be reduced by increasing the sampling interval, it will lose high-frequency components which are used to accurately describe the fast change of polarizability. If the sampling interval is too short, the amount of data will be too large, and it will overload the data flow of the logging instrument. So UTSM is not practical in the applications of in situ well logging. LTSM takes sampling points based on logarithmic time interval, and can match the attenuation characteristics of polarization curve, so it greatly reduces the amount of sampling data. However, since the lithology <b>of</b> actual rock <b>strata</b> is complex, the length of IP relaxation process changes greatly. The LTSM can only be set to a fixed sampling length, which leads to the difficulty of improving the vertical resolution. This paper presents a new way of sampling—UASM, based on equal amplitude interval sampling, which is expected to describe the polarization decay curve accurately with less sampling data. We compare the three methods in terms of the adaptability of the downhole instrument to different pore <b>sizes</b> and distributions <b>of</b> <b>strata,</b> the relationship between number of sampling points and the inversion error, and the vertical resolution to different lithology <b>of</b> <b>strata.</b> Lastly, we give the most suitable number of sampling points by using UASM.|$|R

40|$|Moist-soil {{managers}} manipulate hydrology, soils, {{and vegetation}} to provide habitat and foods for waterfowl {{and other wildlife}} in seasonally flooded herbaceous wetlands. Increasing seed availability for waterfowl is a priority, but managers also provide resources such as invertebrates, tubers, and browse (Fredrickson and Taylor 1982). An important principle in moist-soil management is maintaining a large component of early-successional plant species whose reproductive strategies include production of abundant seed (Cronk and Fennessy 2001). Low and Bellrose (1944) first referred to the annual species that colonize mudflats as moist-soil plants and documented their potential seed production. Fredrickson and Taylor (1982) developed guidelines for modern moistsoil management in the 1970 s and use of moist-soil methods increased rapidly thereafter (Fredrickson 1996). In the Mississippi Alluvial Valley (MAV), state and federal wildlife agencies now manage 3 ̆e 8, 000 ha in 300 impoundments for moist-soil habitat (U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2002). Several methods {{have been used to}} quantify seed availability in moist-soil habitats. Harvesting seeds from inflorescences has been the most common method of estimating seed production of individual plant species (Low and Bellrose 1944, Fredrickson and Taylor 1982, Haukos and Smith 1993). Other researchers have tried to simplify estimating seed production by developing species-specific predictive models relating seed yield to plant morphology (Laubhan and Fredrickson 1992; Gray et al. 1999 a,b). We believe more effort is needed to develop methods to estimate seed availability for management units rather than for individual species because of the increasing number of impoundments managed and the need to understand the role of moist-soil habitat in meeting food requirements of nonbreeding waterfowl (Reinecke and Loesch 1996, Miller and Newton 1999). Double sampling for stratification (hereafter double sampling; Thompson 1992 : 143) potentially increases precision of estimates but does not assume that the <b>stratum</b> membership <b>of</b> plots or the <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>strata</b> are known. Sample units (plots) are assigned to strata during the first sampling period based on predetermined criteria, and stratum sizes are estimated as proportions of plots assigned to strata in the first sample. Successful stratification reduces sampling costs by decreasing the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the second sample needed to achieve the desired level of precision to inform management decisions. We used double sampling to estimate seed availability in moist-soil impoundments. Our strategy involved 2 sampling steps. We selected a large first sample of plots and used qualitative criteria that we believed were correlated to seed availability to assign plots to different <b>strata</b> (levels <b>of</b> seed availability). Then we selected a second (sub) sample of the first sample, and in these plots we measured seed availability by collecting soil cores and plant inflorescences just before waterfowl arrived. We used double sampling to achieve the increased precision associated with stratified designs, and we measured seed availability by collecting soil cores and inflorescences just before waterfowl arrived to assess the abundance of resources actually available to the birds. Previous studies (Low and Bellrose 1944, Laubhan and Fredrickson 1992, Haukos and Smith 1993) have assumed that no mortality of seeds occurs between the time seeds are harvested by researchers during the growing season and the time waterfowl arrive in fall or winter. Our general objective was to determine if double sampling would provide precise, cost-effective, and unbiased estimates of seed availability in moist-soil impoundments. Specific objectives were to (1) estimate mean seed availability for 3 impoundments in each of 2 years; (2) compare the statistical and cost efficiency of double sampling to that of simple random sampling; and (3) determine if incomplete seed recovery from soil cores leads to biased estimates of seed availabilit...|$|R

OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed at {{comparing}} the effect of 3 vitamin D(3) derivatives on the epidermis, microvasculature and DD in psoriasis. METHOD: Twenty men suffering from chronic plaques of psoriasis on the trunk were enrolled in this study. They applied twice a day for 3 weeks calcipotriol, tacalcitol and calcitriol, each to one plaque. Another similar lesion received petrolatum as a placebo treatment. Skin biopsies were taken at entry and at completion of the 3 -week treatment phase. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the lectin of Ulex europaeus and an antibody to factor XIIIa. Computerized image analysis served to measure the stratum Malpighii area, the microvasculature area and the DD numerical density in the papillary dermis. RESULTS: At entry in the study, the 4 test sites were indistinguishable with regard to the stratum Malpighii area, the papillary microvasculature area and the papillary DD density. The 3 histometric parameters appeared correlated with each other. At completion of the 3 -week treatment phase, the 3 vitamin D derivatives had decreased the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stratum</b> Malpighii. In addition, calcitriol had also reduced the DD density in the papillary dermis. No other significant changes were yielded.
