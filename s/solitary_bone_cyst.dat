Objectives: To discuss a <b>solitary</b> <b>bone</b> <b>cyst</b> {{originating}} from the pedicle of the first lumbar vertebra. Summary of Literature Review: The <b>solitary</b> <b>bone</b> <b>cyst</b> in the spinal colume is extremely rare. Since Dawson reported the first case in fourth cervical vertebral body, only 8 cases have been reported. The <b>solitary</b> <b>bone</b> <b>cyst</b> originating in the pedicle of the lumbar vertebra is the first reported case. Materials and Methods: A 53 -year-old female patient visited the emergency room for severe radiating pain to the left lower extremity. T 2 weighted MRI image showed a <b>solitary</b> <b>bone</b> <b>cyst</b> in the left pedicle of the first lumbar vertebra. Results: The medial wall of the pedicle showed cortical breakage causing nerve root compression. Pathology revealed fibrous membrane corresponding to a bone cyst. On postoperative 2 years of follow up, the patient was pain-free enjoying normal daily life. Conclusion: A case report of a <b>solitary</b> <b>bone</b> <b>cyst</b> in the left pedicle of the first lumbar vertebra accompanied with severe radiat...|$|E
40|$|<b>Solitary</b> <b>bone</b> <b>cyst</b> (SEC) {{is a rare}} {{disorder}} of the jaw bones, {{as well as other}} skeletal bones, particularly the long bones. It usually occurs in the metaphyseal region of long bones comprising only around 2 % of all bone cysts affecting this area. <b>Solitary</b> <b>bone</b> <b>cyst</b> is an asymptomatic, slow growing, usually nonexpansile lesion commonly diagnosed incidentally during routine radiographic examination of the jaw bones. Its etiology is not clear and trauma has not been definitely determined to be the cause. It occurs mainly in children and young adults, and the body of the mandible is the most common site On the basis of the literature available, opinions concerning the etiology, pathogenesiss and treatment of this disorder have been presented. A case of incidentally diagnosed <b>solitary</b> <b>bone</b> <b>cyst</b> of the mandible in a 22 years old female patient is presented. The clinical, radiographic and histopathologic features of this cyst have been demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Pathologists and clinicians who are pathologically minded {{have long}} debated the {{question}} of the etiology of the <b>solitary</b> <b>bone</b> <b>cyst,</b> benign giant-cell tumor, and osteitis fibrosa and their relation to malignancy. Schlange’ was probably the first {{to call attention to the}} similarity between the micro-scopic changes in the fleshy lining of a bone cyst and those noted in known cases of low-grade osteomyelitis and his conclusions were supported by the studies of Tietze 2 and Bischoff 3, while Mallory 4 and Bloodgoodtm agreed that the changes in the cyst wall are those of chronic inflammation. The clinical and roentgenological similarity between the benign giant-cell tumor and the <b>solitary</b> <b>bone</b> <b>cyst</b> is well recognized, and in some instances a microscopic examination of the tissues does not clearly differentiate the lesions. While both conditions have been studied in detail by the pathologist, few reports of attempts to culture organisms from either type of lesion have been made.

40|$|<b>Solitary</b> <b>bone</b> <b>cysts</b> are benign osteolytic lesions rarely {{involving}} the mandibular condyle.

40|$|The {{following}} review {{investigates the}} term and {{concept of the}} globulomaxillary cyst as a correct clinico-pathological diagnosis to describe a so-called fissural cyst said {{to be caused by}} epithelial entrapment between the nasal and maxillary process. After analyzing the available literature it has to be concluded that neither from an embryologic nor from a clinical or pathohistological standpoint the term globulomaxillary cyst represents a real entity by itself. Therefore, globulomaxillary cysts have to be diagnosed alternatively after a thorough clinical, radiological and histological examination as other odontogenic cysts like dentigerous cysts or odontogenic keratocysts, odontogenic tumors like ameloblastoma, central giant cell tumors, <b>solitary</b> <b>bone</b> <b>cysts,</b> etc. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

As the number of septa increased, an increased difficulty in obtaining an equal distribution of MPA inside the cyst and {{a higher incidence of}} incomplete healing of the cyst was encountered...|$|E
30|$|Despite an {{extensive}} {{literature on the}} unicameral bone cyst (UBC), there remains an uncertainty regarding optimal treatment. Bensahel et al. [42] have stated the <b>solitary</b> <b>bone</b> <b>cyst</b> has not revealed all its secrets. Surgical therapy of a UBC may be divided into open and percutaneous procedures. Success is quite varied and {{the very definition of}} success has also varied amongst authors [43]. The initial treatment of the patient with UBC of the distal fibula in this series was of curettage and bone grafting, after which shortening and deformity occurred. We applied EBI monolateral fixator for lengthening and deformity correction.|$|E
40|$|Simple bone cysts (SBC) are pseudocysts {{occurring}} less commonly in the maxillofacial region. The {{uncertain and}} unclear etiopathogenesis led to numerous synonyms to refer this particular cyst. These cysts are devoid of an epithelial lining {{and are usually}} empty or contain blood or straw-colored fluid. In jaws initially it mimics a periapical cyst and later can lead to cortical bone expansion warranting for radical approach, which is seldom required. SBC is predominantly diagnosed in first two decades of life. Here we report a case of <b>solitary</b> <b>bone</b> <b>cyst</b> mimicking a periapical cyst of a mandibular molar in a 37 -year-old patient...|$|E
40|$|<b>Solitary</b> <b>bone</b> <b>cysts</b> (SBCs) exist {{generally}} as asymptomatic solitary lesions {{and have}} no epithelial lining. They are uncommon in the jaws and are often polymorphic, show scalloped borders when located between the roots. They have higher predilection for the posterior mandible, mostly occurring near the mental foramen. Various pathomechanisms were proposed, but the triggering factor still remains to be ascertained. Currently, osteolytic pathogenesis is speculated, which {{may be due to}} vascular alteration leading to aseptic osseous necrosis. Fibro-osseous lesions are occasionally associated with SBCs, but concomitant presence with tooth agenesis has not been reported. We present a unique case of SBC with familial tooth agenesis in a 16 -year-old female patient with a brief review...|$|R
40|$|The ulna {{is a rare}} site {{of origin}} for osteosarcoma, and purely osteolytic osteosarcomas are uncommonly noted on {{conventional}} radiographs. We present a patient with a lytic lesion of the distal ulna for which imaging findings suggested an aneurysmal <b>bone</b> <b>cyst.</b> The lesion was histologically confirmed to be a fibrob-lastic osteosarcoma. steosarcoma {{is the second most}} common primary malignant bone tumor, accounting for approximately 15 % of all primary bone tumors confirmed at biopsy (1). Osteosarcomas most frequently affect long bones, particu-larly around the knee, and rarely the ulna (1, 2). On radiographs, osteosarcomas classi-cally appear as aggressive destructive lesions with a mixed osteolytic and sclerotic pattern, associated periosteal reaction, and soft-tissue mass. The purely osteolytic form of osteosarcoma occurs in about 10 % of all cases (3). The differential diagnosis of lytic and expansive <b>bone</b> lesions includes <b>solitary</b> <b>bone</b> <b>cysts,</b> aneurysmal <b>bone</b> <b>cysts,</b> giant cell tumors, enchondromas, and telangiectatic osteosarcomas (4).

40|$|<b>Solitary</b> <b>bone</b> <b>cysts</b> (SBCs) of {{the jaws}} are often polymorphic, show {{scalloped}} borders when located between the teeth roots, are devoid of an epithelial lining, {{and are usually}} empty or contain blood or a straw-colored fluid. The numerous synonyms referring to these lesions reflect their uncertain nature (eg, traumatic <b>bone</b> <b>cyst,</b> simple <b>bone</b> <b>cyst).</b> SBC, also found in other skeletal locations, is often suspected after epidemiologic and radiologic test results and confirmed at surgery. Histology usually shows fibrous connective tissue or only bone. The various etiologic elements responsible for SBC include tumor degeneration, trauma, or abnormalities during bone growth. The pathogenesis of the SBC is unknown, but it is widely accepted {{that it could be}} the result of a vascular dysfunction leading to a local posthemorrhagic ischemia, inducing an osseous aseptic necrosis.

40|$|ABSTRACTSolitary bone cyst of the {{mandible}} is an intra-osseous cavity lacking epithelial lining {{considered a}} pseudocyst. Due to its uncertain etiology and pathogenesis, {{it has received}} several names such as traumatic bone cyst or idiopathic bone cyst. From a clinical perspective, it is oftentimes an asymptomatic lesion, with festooned borders when located between dental roots. It is an empty cavity but might contain blood, serous or serous-hematic fluid and can be perceived in routine X-ray examinations.

40|$|Introduction. Spinal simple <b>bone</b> <b>cysts,</b> {{also known}} as solitary cysts, are {{extremely}} unusual benign primary bone tumors with few cases reported in the literature. Case Presentation. Incidental Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) finding of a C 2 Simple <b>bone</b> <b>cyst</b> in a 13 -year-old female patient is reported. Complementary studies suggested the benign nature of the lesion. Patient underwent cervical curettage followed by tumor excision. A lateral submandibular approach to the upper cervical spine was used and careful bone resection was possible with a radiofrequency assisted burr and no instrumentation or fixation was required. The stability of the defect was ensured by filling it with bone allograft and by prescribing a postsurgical plastic cervical collar to maintain neck immobilization. Histological examination supported the diagnosis of simple <b>bone</b> <b>cyst.</b> At 6 – 12 -month follow-up the patient presented no recurrence or symptomatology. Conclusions. <b>Solitary</b> <b>bone</b> <b>cysts</b> are infrequent entities in the cervical vertebrae and preservation of spine stability without instrumentation to avoid neurological complications is often challenging. In this case, {{the proximity of the}} cyst to the right vertebral artery and the risk of injury were high; however the surgical approach used was successful and no recurrence or instability was evidenced on postoperative MRI...|$|R
30|$|Nonvascularized grafts are {{technically}} {{much easier}} to use than vascularized grafts and provide excellent structural bone support at the recipient side [16]. Successful long-term results of surgical en bloc resection and replacement with nonvascularized, autologous fibular or tibial graft {{have been reported in}} the literature for the treatment of large benign humeral lesions [9, 10, 16]. Grezegorzewski et al. [9] reported the long-term results in 20 patients with unilateral benign humeral lesions where steroid injection, curettage and bone grafting or pathological fracture failed to restore bone integrity. Lesions included ABCs, <b>solitary</b> <b>bone</b> <b>cysts</b> and fibrous dysplasia. No recurrence of the pathology, pain, graft fracture or limitation in range of motion were noted. There were 2 – 6  cm shortening of the humerus in three cases at the time of the last follow-up examination. Humeral shortening was observed only in those patients in whom the cyst was adjacent to the proximal growth plate of the humeral bone.|$|R
40|$|Aims To {{assess the}} immunophenotypic and mRNA {{expression}} of sclerostin in human skeletal tissues {{and in a}} wide range of benign and malignant bone tumours and tumour-like lesions. Methods and Results: Sclerostin expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and quantitative PCR. In lamellar and woven bone, there was strong sclerostin expression by osteocytes. Osteoblasts and other cell types in bone were negative. Hypertrophic chondrocytes in the growth plate and mineralized cartilage cells in zone 4 of hyaline articular cartilage strongly expressed sclerostin but most chondrocytes in hyaline cartilage were negative. In primary bone-forming tumours there was patchy expression of sclerostin in mineralized osteoid and bone of bone-forming tumours including osteosarcomas. Sclerostin staining was seen in woven bone in fibrous dysplasia, osteofibrous dysplasia and in reactive bone formed in fracture callus, myositis ossificans and in the wall of <b>solitary</b> <b>bone</b> <b>cysts</b> and aneurysmal <b>bone</b> <b>cysts.</b> Sclerostin was expressed by hypertrophic chondrocytes in osteochondroma and chondroblasts in chondroblastoma but not by tumour cells in other bone tumours including myeloma and metastatic carcinoma. mRNA expression of sclerostin was identified by quantitative PCR in osteosarcoma specimens and cell lines. Conclusions Sclerostin is an osteocyte marker which is strongly expressed in human woven and lamellar bone and mineralizing chondrocytes. This makes it a useful marker to identify benign and malignant osteogenic tumours and mineralizing cartilage tumours, such as chondroblastomas and other lesions in which there is bone formation. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The <b>solitary</b> <b>bone</b> <b>cyst</b> is {{a typical}} tumor-like lesion of the {{immature}} skeleton, whose etio-pathogenesis is still unclear. The purpose of this work is to perform {{a review of the}} literature about the different surgical approaches focusing on the role of bone substitutes and growth factors. Literature analysis shows injection techniques of substances such as methylprednisolone, autologous bone marrow, demineralized bone matrix, calcium sulphate and surgical techniques that involve the resection and curettage associated with bone graft and/or intramedullary nailing. Although there are good results currently associated to these techniques and the different ways of treatment, the only evidence-based treatment is given by injections of steroids. However, given the high rate of failure, autologous bone marrow and platelet gel represent a viable therapeutic option...|$|E
40|$|Fifty-nine {{cases of}} lesions {{presenting}} in the patella were identified after {{review of the}} databases of four European bone tumour registries.

40|$|Dentin {{matrix protein}} 1 (DMP- 1) is highly {{expressed}} by osteocytes {{and is a}} non-collagenous matrix protein found in dentin and bone. In this study, we determined the expression of DMP- 1 in mature and immature human bone and examined whether DMP- 1 is useful in distinguishing osteoid/bone-forming tumours from other primary and secondary bone tumours. DMP- 1 expression was immunohistochemically determined in paraffin sections {{of a wide range}} of benign and malignant primary bone tumours and tumour-like lesions (n[*]=[*] 353). DMP- 1 mRNA expression was also examined in osteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma cell lines as well as bone tumour specimens (n[*]=[*] 5) using real-time PCR. In lamellar and woven bone, DMP- 1 was expressed in the matrix around osteocyte lacunae and canaliculi; osteoblasts and other cell types in the bone were negative. Matrix staining of the osteoid and bone was seen in bone-forming tumours including osteoma, osteoid osteoma, osteoblastoma and osteosarcoma. DMP- 1 staining was also seen in fibrous dysplasia, osteofibrous dysplasia and chondroblastoma and in reactive <b>bone</b> in <b>solitary</b> <b>bone</b> <b>cysts</b> and aneurysmal <b>bone</b> <b>cysts.</b> DMP- 1 was not expressed in the tumour component of other bone neoplasms including Ewing sarcoma, chondrosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, giant cell tumour of bone and metastatic carcinoma.

DMP- 1 is a matrix marker expressed around osteocytes in human woven and lamellar bone and is useful in identifying osteosarcoma and other bone-forming tumours...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Data on {{childhood}} bone {{tumors are}} mainly confined to reports on malignant tumors or on institutional registries. Incidence figures on both benign and malignant bone tumors in childhood are lacking. Methods: From January 1999 to December 2003, 1474 newly diagnosed bone tumors in children up to 18 years were registered in Pathologisch Anatomisch Landelijk Geautomatiscerd Archief (the nationwide network and registry of histopathology and cytopathology in The Netherlands). Data provided were diagnosis, date of birth, age at diagnosis, and localization. For incidence calculations, data on {{age and sex}} in each year of investigation {{were obtained from the}} StatLine database of Statistics Netherlands (www. cbs. nl). Results/Conclusions: Incidence of pathology-proven bone tumors in children is low. Incidence of pathology-proven bone tumors in The Netherlands is 79. 3 per 1, 000, 000. From the very first year of life, incidence increases from 3. 9 per 1, 000, 000 to a peak at 13 to 15 years of 142. 9 per 1, 000, 000. Osteochondromas are the most prevalent tumors, followed by aneurysmal <b>bone</b> <b>cysts.</b> The overall incidence is higher for male compared with female patients, mainly due to different frequencies found in aneurysmal <b>bone</b> <b>cysts,</b> Ewing sarcoma, and osteochondroma. Shifts in incidence differ among the various tumors. In infants, bone tumors are mainly chondromas and fibrous dysplasia, which both show a steady increase at older ages. Tumors most prevalent at older ages are osteochondromas, osteosarcomas, osteoid osteomas, and chondromas. A peak incidence at approximately the age of 10 is noted for <b>solitary</b> <b>bone</b> <b>cysts,</b> nonossifying fibromas, and osteoblastomas. Small children more often have localizations in the skull and facial bones. Comparison with literature data showed significant differences due to referral-based institutionally bias, whereas tumor registries only give data for specific tumor type...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjective is to {{identify}} epidemiologic and radiologic criteria allowing specific diagnoses of tumors and tumor-like lesions in the hip region and pelvis, and to optimize pre-operative staging. Patients with pelvic tumors are usually older, and their tumors are larger relative to patients with tumors in extremities. The majority of tumors in the pelvis are malignant (metastases, myeloma, chondrosarcoma, Ewing-, osteo-, and MFH/fibrosarcoma), while those in the proximal femur are in majority benign (fibrous dysplasia, <b>solitary</b> <b>bone</b> <b>cyst,</b> and osteoid osteoma). Soft tissue masses in the thigh in the elderly are typically sarcomas without tumor specific signs. Common tumor-like lesions occurring in the hip and pelvis that can mimic neoplasm are: infections (including tuberculosis), insufficiency/avulsion fractures, cysts, fibrous dysplasia, aneurysmal bone cyst, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and Paget's disease. Local MR staging {{is based on the}} compartmental anatomy. The psoas and gluteal muscles are easily invaded by sarcoma originating in the ileum. The pectineus muscle protects the neurovascular bundle {{at the level of the}} hip.

40|$|Introduction. Difference {{in length}} of upper {{extremities}} has mainly esthetic significance {{and is therefore}} not so often a subject of operative treatment, compared to lower extremities. Case Outline. We are presenting {{a case of a}} 16 ­year­old patient in whom a shortening of 9 cm of the right humerus was determined at the end of growth. This shortening was the result of surgical treatment of <b>solitary</b> <b>bone</b> <b>cyst</b> at the proximal end of the humerus done at the age of 10 years. In order to correct the length of the humerus we applied distraction osteogenesis with a compressive­distracting device according to Mitkovic (Traffix), and we achieved the lengthening of 7. 5 cm. During the period of distraction we encountered the following complications: minimal suppuration {{at the site of the}} wedges that was successfully resolved with intensive local treatment, while pain and paresthesias along the N. radialis were resolved with a temporarily slowing of the distraction process. Fixation with a plate, i. e. bone grafting was not necessary, and final functional and esthetic result was excellent. Conclusion. Successful lengthening of the shortened humerus can be achieved with a unilateral compressive­distracting device according to Mitkovic as its application up to a complete bone reconstruction does not require additional plate fixation or bone grafting. The patient was capable of performing usual daily activities during application of the device...|$|E
30|$|Unicameral <b>bone</b> <b>cyst</b> (UBC) is {{a benign}} lesion that mostly affects {{children}} and adolescents, and represents about 3  % of primary tumors {{in the first}} two decades of life [1, 2, 3].

The typical location is in the metaphysis adjacent to the growth plate of the tubular bones, mostly the humerus and femur [3]. Based on the distance between the cyst and the growth plate, UBC is classified as active when the distance is less than 5  mm, and latent when the distance is larger than 5  mm [4]. Other locations of UBC may include the pelvis, ribs, vertebrae and the tarsal bones, especially calcaneus.

The largest number of patients referred, to age interval from 11 to 30 years (69, 6 %). More than half of cases were osteochondromas (54 %), then <b>solitary</b> <b>bone</b> <b>cyst</b> (14, 5 %) and chondromas (13 %). Other nosologic forms were met significantly seldom. Two groups of patients were examined: the main group (with crio-influence) - 44 patients and group of comparison (without crio-influence) - 87 patients. The plot of operation was in flat, border-line, intrafocusal or segmental resection of damaged section, crio-instillation or contact curio-processing of bone and auto- or allopathic of respected defect. The results of treatment were estimated in a year after operation. After usage of curio-surgical method there were observed positive results in 41 patients, satisfactory - in 2 and unsatisfactory - in 1. The results of treatment with traditional method were positive in 79 cases, satisfactory - in 2, unsatisfactory - in 6. The worked-out method of curio-surgical treatment of foot bone tumours includes resection of pathological focus, itraoperative crio-influence on bone tissue and bone plastic transplantation of resected, defect.

40|$|Background: Fibro-osseous lesions (FOLs) of {{the jaws}} {{comprise}} a diverse and interesting group of conditions with variable classification systems that challenge the diagnostic acumen. Microscopically they are characterised by a fibrous stroma containing various combinations of bone and/ cementum like material. Methodology: Among 106 cases of bone lesion biopsies submitted to our department from 2004 to 2015, 69 (65 %) cases were diagnosed as FOLs. The demographic data, radiographic and histological findings were corroborated and statistical analysis {{was done and}} compared with similar studies present in the literature. Results: The most common lesion {{was found to be}} (0 F) ossifying fibroma (26 %) followed by (COF) Cemento-ossifying fibroma (24. 6 %), (CGG) Central giant cell granuloma (21. 7 %), (CF) cementifying fibroma (11. 5 %) and (FD) fibrous dysplasia (11. 5 %) with least occurrence of (COD) cement-osseous dysplasia (2. 8 %) and (SBC) <b>solitary</b> <b>bone</b> <b>cyst</b> (1. 4 %).

30|$|The simple bone cyst (SBC), {{also known}} as <b>solitary</b> <b>bone</b> <b>cyst,</b> {{traumatic}} bone cyst, haemorrhagic cyst or idiopathic bone cavity is filled with serous or haemorrhagic fluid and is characterised {{by the absence of}} an epithelial lining. Therefore, SBC is not a true cyst but rather a pseudocyst. SBC of the mandible usually occurs secondary to trauma, typically after tooth extraction with subsequent intramedullary haemorrhage. Most SBCs occur before the age of 20 with female predominance [18]. In up to 75  % of all cases, SBCs are seen in the marrow of the posterior mandible. Most lesions are asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on dental radiographs. SBC occurs in close proximity to a vital tooth and is not associated with bone swelling unless there is associated infection. Surgical exploration may be necessary in selected cases to exclude other unilocular radiolucent lesions, such as keratocysts. On imaging, most SBCs appear as unilocular, well-defined radiolucent lesions that vary in size. Rarely, poorly defined borders are observed. Extension to the cortical bone is rare and usually there is no tooth displacement [18]. The superior margins are irregular and scallop around teeth roots. CT and MRI can provide information on the haemorrhagic content but the density or signal intensity, respectively, may vary depending on the age of the haemorrhage. On MRI, the cysts display a homogeneous intermediate signal on T 1, homogeneous high signal on T 2, and no enhancement after injection of intravenous contrast media. Treatment consists of bone curettage, leading to bleeding with subsequent scar formation.|$|E

A 4 -year-old Shih-Tzu, {{referred}} for an enlarged left carpus, {{was diagnosed with}} a unicameral <b>bone</b> <b>cyst.</b> A customized titanium device was inserted into cystic lesion and fixed by titanium screws. Sufficient strength of the affected bone with the device inserted to maintain limb function was established after resection of contents of cystic lesion. There was no deterioration of the lesion of <b>bone</b> <b>cyst,</b> and acceptable function of the affected limb with no clinical signs of lameness was maintained during 36 months follow-up. The results of this study demonstrated that <b>bone</b> <b>cyst</b> curettage and use of a customized titanium device could provide an effective alternative treatment of huge lesion of unicameral <b>bone</b> <b>cysts</b> with the intent of preventing pathologic fractures.
