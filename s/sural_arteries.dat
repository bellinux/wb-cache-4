5000|$|The <b>sural</b> <b>arteries</b> (inferior muscular arteries) are {{two large}} branches, which are {{distributed}} to the gastrocnemius, soleus, and plantaris muscles. The term applies to any {{of four or five}} arteries arising from the popliteal artery, with distribution to the muscles and integument of the calf, and with anastomoses to the posterior tibial, medial and lateral inferior genicular arteries.|$|E
30|$|This flap was {{conceived}} on a sound anatomical basis. The popliteal artery in the popliteal fossa gives two dominant branches, one each to the medial and lateral head of gastrocnemius and another branch, which continues as the <b>sural</b> <b>artery.</b> The <b>sural</b> <b>artery</b> divides into median, lateral and medial branches. The {{first one is}} constant {{and the other two}} are reciprocal in size. There is also a reciprocal relationship in size between direct cutaneous sural vessels and muscular branches supplying the gastrocnemius heads. The median <b>sural</b> <b>artery</b> accompanies the <b>sural</b> nerve and vein until the proximal calf region. The median <b>sural</b> <b>artery</b> supplies the posterior mid-calf skin and subcutaneous tissue. This suprafascial vascular network arborises both longitudinally and radially and anastomoses with septocutaneous perforators of the peroneal artery in the distal third region of the calf. This reliable plexus between two different sources, the peroneal artery and the median <b>sural</b> <b>artery</b> via the septocutaneous perforators, forms the basis of the distally based fasciocutaneous sural flap from the posterior and posterolateral aspect of the mid-calf region. Among many septocutaneous perfortaors, the distal most is given at 5  cm above the lateral malleolus.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The reverse <b>sural</b> <b>artery</b> flap is a {{generally}} accepted means of soft tissue reconstruction for defects of the distal {{third of the}} legs. The routine sacrifice of the sural nerve with its consequential temporary loss of sensation on the lateral aspect of the foot can be of concern to early rehabilitation of some patients. Method This is a case report of a 24 years old male who had Gustillo and Anderson type IIIB injury involving {{the upper part of}} the distal 3 rd and the middle 3 rd of tibia. A reverse <b>sural</b> <b>artery</b> flap was raised without transecting the sural nerve to cover the distal part of the defect. Result The distal part of the exposed bone was covered with the reverse <b>sural</b> <b>artery</b> flap without loss of sensation at anytime to the lateral part of the foot. Conclusion The reverse <b>sural</b> <b>artery</b> flap can be raised to cover the upper portion of the distal leg without severing the sural nerve. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} the feasibitity of distally based superficial <b>sural</b> <b>artery</b> flap in treating the defects of lower leg, ankle and heel. Patients & Methods: The medical records {{of patients with}} lower leg, ankle and heel defects undergoing reconstructive surgery using the distally based superficial <b>sural</b> <b>artery</b> flaps at Lampang Regional Hospital between January 1998 and December 2001 were reviewed. During the study period, 15 patients underwent such reconstructive surgery for soft tissue defects due to trauma (9), open fractures (2) and chronic ulcers (4). The defects were in non weight bearing heels in 6 patients, in the ankle areas, weight bearing heels, and distal tibia 1 areas in 5, 2 and 3 patients, respectively. The average time of the operations was 60 minutes. Three patients developed minor flap complications, i. e. partial necrosis, venous congestion, and superficial infection. Overall, all 15 flaps survived. The distally based superficial <b>sural</b> <b>artery</b> flap is a feasible reconstructive procedure for treating the defects of lower leg, ankle and heel...|$|R
40|$|El colgajo sural fasciomiocutáneo es ampliamente utilizado en la reparación de defectos profundos de tejidos blandos del miembro {{inferior}} distal. Este estudio describe su base anatómica mediante la morfometría de las arterias perforantes en una {{muestra de}} nuestra población chilena. Material y Método: Se utilizaron 8 miembros inferiores de amputaciones supracondileas. Previa repleción con látex coloreado vía poplítea, se procedió a disecar los miembros inferiores para así obtener un colgajo fasciomiocutáneo sural de pedículo distal. Una vez obtenida la isla, se procedió a elevar el colgajo y disecar su pedículo. Luego se realizó la mor-fometría de las arterias perforantes tanto por lateral como por medial al pedículo, desde el punto pívot definido a 5 cm cefálico al maléolo lateral, hasta la base de la isla fasciomiocutánea. Se describió la distribución de la irrigación y se realizó registro fotográfico de los hallazgos. Resultados: El paquete vasculonervioso sural con un nervio fue identificado en todas las disecciones. La morfología arterial predominante fue la distribución como plexo perineural. Se reconocen tres arterias surales (lateral, mediana y medial). Fueron identificadas 3 a 6 perforantes hacia medial y 4 a 5 hacia lateral del pedículo. Conclusiones: La distribución de la arteria sural es variable y en la mayoría de los casos se presenta como plexo perineural. Dados los hallazgos de las perforantes, consideramos que el punto de giro del colgajo se encuentra aproximadamente a 5, 5 cm del maleolo lateral, lo cual coincide con el punto ideal para la viabilidad del colgajo informado en otras series. Background: The distally based sural fasciomyocutaneous flap {{is widely used}} in the coverage of deep soft tissue defects on the distal third of lower limbs. Aim: To perform a morphometric description of the perforating arteries that supplies the flap. Material and Methods: We used eight lower limbs from amputations performed above the knee. The limbs were injected through the popliteal artery with red colored latex. After the injection, the limbs were dissected to obtain a distally based sural fasciomyocutaneous flap. Once the fasciomyocutaneous island was obtained, the flap was elevated dissecting its pedicle. Once the whole flap was dissected, a morphometric registry of the lateral and medial perforating arteries was performed. The pivot point for the flap was set 5 cm above the upper border of the lateral malleolus. The distance between the upper border of the lateral malleolus {{and the emergence of}} each perforating artery was measured. Results: The sural nerve was identified in all eight dissections. A perineural plexus was the source of the blood supply of the flap, in three of the eight dissections. In two dissections, three <b>sural</b> <b>arteries</b> were identified (medial, median and lateral). The lateral sural artery was identified in two dissections and the medial and lateral arteries in one. Three to six perforating arteries were identified in the medial part of the pedicle and four to five perforating arteries in the lateral part of the pedicle. Conclusions: The distribution of the sural artery along the flap's pedicle is very variable. The most common distribution in these dissections was {{in the form of a}} perineural plexus. Considering the distance from the lateral malleolus to the emergence of the perforating arteries, the pivot point of the flap, should be set approximately at 5. 5 centimeters above the lateral malleolus...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Background. The radial forearm flap is {{frequently}} considered {{the first choice}} for tongue reconstruction, but the disadvantages of donor site morbidity are well known. The search for another thin skin flap as an alternative {{has led to the}} application of the medial <b>sural</b> <b>artery</b> perforator flap. Methods. We used 12 medial <b>sural</b> <b>artery</b> perforator flaps to reconstruct tongue and floor of mouth following cancer ablation. We paid attention to the major perforator (vein 1 mm) as the vascular relay. Results. Most flaps were raised with a single perforator. The size of the skin paddle varied from 9 cm 3 5 cm to 14 cm 3 12 cm. The mean thickness of the flap was 5. 2 mm. We reex-plored 1 patient for venous insufficiency and could not salvage the flap.

40|$|Hemophilia B {{is a rare}} blood {{coagulation}} disorder. Complications such as {{bleeding and}} hematoma can cause necrosis of flaps, wound disruption, and the disturbance of wound healing. In particular, guidelines for flap operations in hemophilia B patients have still not been defined, and case reports are rare. We reconstructed the heel of a 41 -year-old male hemophilia B patient using a reverse <b>sural</b> <b>artery</b> flap operation. The patient presented with mild hemophilia, having 27 % of the normal value of coagulation factor IX. Coagulation and the changing value of the coagulation factor were regularly measured, and 70 % of the normal value of coagulation factor IX was maintained through the injection of recombinant coagulation factors and antihemorrhagics. Hematoma developed twice (postoperative day [POD] 5 and POD 7) and in each case the hematoma was removed. Injections of recombinant coagulation factors and antihemorrhagics were continuously administered until postoperative week 2. When the coagulation factors were within normal ranges. In this article, a hemophilia B patient underwent reverse <b>sural</b> <b>artery</b> flap surgery and the healing progress was analyzed. We conclude that higher than baseline levels of coagulation factors are needed for successful healing in reverse <b>sural</b> <b>artery</b> flap surgery...|$|R

40|$|Achilles tendon rupture is {{the most}} common ruptur of tendon in the lower limb despite being one of the toughest tendons. This rupture {{presents}} a complex problem to the treating surgeon especially if it is associated with tendon and soft tissue loss. The case in this study is one patient (male, age 30 -year old) with a spectrum of acute and infected open tendon-achilles rupture that includes loss of tendon of up to 5 cm, tendon defect with no distal attachment, and partial loss of the calcaneum. The skin defect measured after debridement ranged from 8 x 5 cm to 15 x 10 cm. The ruptured tendon was sutured using gastrocnemius-soleus turn down flap technic to calcaneus bone. A reverse <b>sural</b> <b>artery</b> was used to provide soft tissue cover. The flap survived. The patient had normal gait, were able to stand on tip toes, had active plantar flexion, and had returned to his original occupation 2 months after reconstruction. He had full range of movement at the ankle. Augmented repair of Achilles tendon rupture with large soft tissue defect using gastrocnemius- soleus turn down flap and <b>sural</b> <b>artery</b> flap are stable enough to allow early weight-bearing with favorable clinical result for this patient.

40|$|The distal {{third of}} the tibia, ankle and heel area is {{difficult}} to reconstruct. For small to medium size defects, local flaps are often an easier alternative than free flap. In lower limb surgery, the sural flap is based on this principle and this flap is becoming increasingly popular. The distally based superficial <b>sural</b> <b>artery</b> flap, first described as a distally based neuro skin flap by masquelet et al., is a skin island flap supplied by the vascular axis of the sural nerve. The main disadvantage of distally based <b>sural</b> <b>artery</b> flap is sacrifice of the sural nerve because it is described the concept of neurocutaneus island flap.

40|$|Combined {{extended}} {{nerve and}} soft tissue defects {{of the upper}} extremity require nerve reconstruction and adequate soft tissue coverage. This study focuses on {{the reliability of the}} free vascularized sural nerve graft combined with a fasciocutaneous posterior calf flap within this indication. An anatomical study was performed on 26 cadaveric lower extremities that had been Thiel fixated and color silicone injected. Dissection of the fasciocutaneous posterior calf flap involved the medial sural nerve and superficial <b>sural</b> <b>artery</b> (SSA) with its septocutaneous perforators, extended laterally to include the lateral cutaneous branch of the sural nerve and continued to the popliteal origin of the vascular pedicle and the nerves. The vessel and nerves diameter were measured with an eyepiece reticle at 4. 5 × magnification. Length and diameter of the nerves and vessels were carefully assessed and reported in the dissection book. A total of 26 flaps were dissected. The SSA originated from the medial <b>sural</b> <b>artery</b> (13 cases), the popliteal artery (12 cases), or the lateral <b>sural</b> <b>artery</b> (one case). The average size of the SSA was 1. 4 ± 0. 4 mm. The mean pedicle length before the <b>artery</b> joined the <b>sural</b> nerve was 4. 5 ± 1. 9 cm. A comitant vein was present in 21 cases with an average diameter of 2. 0 ± 0. 8 mm, in 5 cases a separate vein needed to be dissected with an average diameter of 3. 5 ± 0. 4 mm. The mean medial vascularized sural nerve length was 21. 2 ± 8. 9 cm. Because of inclusion of the vascularized part of the lateral branch of the sural nerve (mean length of 16. 7 ± 4. 8 cm), a total of 35. 0 ± 9. 6 cm mean length of vascularized nerve could be gained from each extremity. The free vascularized sural nerve graft combined with a fasciocutaneous posterior calf flap pedicled on the SSA offers a reliable solution for complex tissue and nerve defect. Clin.

Accompanying the lateral sural nerve in the initial segment, it pierces the fascia {{at the level of}} the middle third and upper third of the lower leg junction, and travels with the lesser saphenous vein, sending out several branches along its course (to the medial/lateral sural nerve, lesser saphenous vein, deep fascia, and subcutaneous fat layer) in the upper segment of the posterior-lateral leg (Fig.  1 b).|$|R
40|$|BackgroundA recent {{advancement}} in microsurgery, the free flap {{is widely used}} in {{the reconstruction of the}} lower leg and foot. The simple and effective methods of local flaps, including transposition and advancement flaps, have been considered for patients with chronic debilitation who are unable to endure long surgical procedures or general anesthesia. However, the location and size of the wound may restrict the clinical application of a local flap. Under these circumstances, a sural flap can be an excellent alternative, rendering satisfying clinical outcomes in chronically debilitated patients. MethodsBetween 2008 and 2012, 39 patients underwent soft tissue defect treatment by <b>sural</b> <b>artery</b> flap as a final method. All of the patients had at least one chronic disease or more (diabetes, hypertension, vascular disease, etc.). Also, all of the patients had a history of chronic lower extremity ulceration, which revealed no response to several months of conservative treatment. ResultsThe results of the 39 cases had a success rate of 100 % with 39 complete recoveries. Nine cases suffered complications: partial necrosis (n= 4), wound dehiscence without necrosis (n= 3), hematoma (n= 1), and infection (n= 1). ConclusionsThe <b>sural</b> <b>artery</b> flap is not only useful for the lower leg but also for the heel, and other various parts. Furthermore, it is a relatively simple surgical technique for reconstructing the defect area for patients with various chronic conditions with a high surgical risk or contraindications to surgery...|$|R
30|$|The {{nutrient}} vessel of {{the lesser}} saphenous vein and the lateral sural nerve originates from the superficial <b>sural</b> <b>artery,</b> musculocutaneous perforators of the posterior tibial artery, and septocutaneous perforators of the peroneal artery in different {{segment of the}} calf. Meanwhile, these vessels have many sub-branches nourishing subcutaneous tissue and skin, form a favorable vascular chain around the nerve and the vein, and also communicate with vascular plexus of superficial and deep fascia. Among 15 flaps, 13 showed complete survival (86.66  %), while marginal flap necrosis occurred in one patient (6.67  %) and distal wound dehiscence in another (6.67  %). Their appearance and function were satisfactory, with feeling maintained in the heel and lateral side of the foot.|$|R
40|$|BackgroundThe {{distally}} based <b>sural</b> <b>artery</b> flap is a reliable, local reconstructive {{option for}} small soft tissue defects of the distal {{third of the}} leg. The {{purpose of this study}} is to describe an adipofascial flap based on a single sural nerve branch without sacrificing the entire sural nerve, thereby preserving sensibility of the lateral foot. MethodsThe posterior aspect of the lower limb was dissected in 15 cadaveric limbs. Four patients with soft tissue defects over the tendo-achilles and ankle underwent reconstruction using the adipofascial flap, which incorporated the distal peroneal perforator, short saphenous vein, and a single branch of the sural nerve. ResultsFrom the anatomical study, the distal peroneal perforator was situated at an average of 6. 2 cm (2. 5 - 12 cm) from the distal tip of the lateral malleolus. The medial and lateral sural nerve branches ran subfascially and pierced the muscle fascia 16 cm (14 - 19 cm) proximal to the lateral malleolus to enter the subcutaneous plane. They merged 1 - 2 cm distal to the subcutaneous entry point to form the common sural nerve at a mean distance of 14. 5 cm (11. 5 - 18 cm) proximal to the lateral malleolus. This merging point determined the pivot point of the flap. In the clinical cases, all patients reported near complete recovery of sensation over the lateral foot six months after surgery. All donor sites healed well with a full range of motion over the foot and ankle. ConclusionsThe distally based <b>sural</b> <b>artery</b> adipofascial flap allowed for minimal sensory loss, a good range of motion, an aesthetically acceptable outcome and can be performed by a single surgeon in under 2 hours...|$|R
30|$|There {{are several}} {{techniques}} {{to cover the}} soft tissue defects of distal two-thirds of the tibia and foot [1 – 13]. The description of the neurocutaneous Masquelet flaps has revolutionised the osteoplastic armamentarium of surgeons not conversant with microvascular free flaps [14]. The reliability of septocutaneous perforators has been well documented. Hence, raising a flap based on this reliable anastomosis of peroneal <b>artery</b> and median <b>sural</b> <b>artery,</b> along with the sural nerve and short saphenous vein has been described to be successful. The posterior and posterolateral aspect of the calf is usually spared in cases of distal lower limb soft tissue defects. In addition, the distally based flap can be easily elevated and rotated to cover the defects over a large area.|$|R
30|$|In our research, the distally-based sural neuro-veno-fasciocutaneous flap was pedicled {{with the}} {{nutrient}} arteries of the lateral sural nerve and the lesser saphenous vein originating from the superficial <b>sural</b> <b>artery</b> and the musculocutaneous perforators of the {{posterior tibial artery}} {{as well as the}} interseptum perforators of the downward peroneal artery. These formed chain-linked vascular plexuses by connecting with each other and the anastomosis of the vascular networks from the superficial fascia, deep fascia and subdermis. There are abundant communicating branches between these vascular networks, meaning that the arteries to nerves, veins, fascia, and skin share a common origin, thus forming a multisegmental vascular plexus along the whole nerve trunk with ample blood supply. This provides abundant blood perfusion for the flap.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Soft tissue defects over {{ankle and}} foot region are {{encountered}} quite frequently following road traffic trauma and surgery. Management of such cases is a challenging task for any reconstructive surgeon because of paucity {{of skin and}} relative poor vascular status of skin in this region. Hence, invariably such cases require microsurgical free flap coverage, expertise for {{which may not be}} available at all the centers, such procedures require long operating hours and suitable recipient vessel may not be available in crush injuries. Materials and Methods: Thirty consecutive patients having soft tissue defects around ankle and foot region who underwent various reconstructive procedures in a medical college hospital during last 2 years form the basis of this study. This study was carried out to enlist various etiological factors and reconstructive surgical procedures employed to manage such cases without microsurgery. Results: The age of these patients ranged from 9 to 72 years. Twenty-five patients were males while 05 were females, {{with a mean age of}} 25 years. Road traffic accidents happened to be the primary cause of such defects in as many as 15 patients, cycle spoke trauma in 02 patients, implant exposure following orthopedic surgery in 6 patients, diabetic angiopathy in 4 patients and chronic osteomyelitis in 3 patients. The site of the defect was lower fourth of tibia in 16 patients, dorsum of foot in 2 patients, sole in 5 patients, medial aspect of ankle in 02 cases, lateral aspect in 02 cases and retro calcaneal region in 03 cases. In 10 cases distally based superficial <b>sural</b> <b>artery</b> flap was used to reconstruct the defect. In step rotation flap was used to provide sensory flap cover in the weight bearing heel in 04 cases. Inferiorly based fasciocutanenous flaps in 09 cases and muscle flaps were used in 07 cases. Conclusion: Distally based <b>sural</b> <b>artery</b> based flaps are very handy to provide skin cover around ankle and malleolar regions. Muscle flap can be used when the defect is small but deep to obliterate the cavity and it can be covered with skin graft...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The sensory {{loss and}} {{alteration}} of {{the shape of}} the foot make the foot liable to trauma and pressure, and subsequently cause more callus formation, blisters, and ulcers. Foot ulcers usually are liable to secondary infection as cellulitis or osteomyelitis, and may result in amputations. Foot ulcers are a major problem and a major cause of handicaps in leprosy patients. The current study is to present our clinical experience and evaluate the use of sural flap with posterior tibial neurovascular decompression (PTND) in recurrent foot ulcers in leprosy patients. Patient and methods: A total number of 9 patients were suffering from chronic sequelae of leprosy as recurrent foot ulcers. All the patients were reconstructed with the reverse <b>sural</b> <b>artery</b> fasciocutaneous flap with posterior tibial neurovascular decompression from September 2012 to August 2015. Six patients were male and three were female {{with a mean age of}} 39. 8 years (range, 30 – 50 years). All the soft tissue defects were in the weight-bearing area of the inside of the foot. The flap sizes ranged from 15 / 4 to 18 / 6 cm. Mean follow-up period was 21. 2 months (range, 35 – 2 months). Results: All the flaps healed uneventfully. There was no major complication as total flap necrosis. Only minor complications occurred which were treated without surgical intervention except in two patients who developed superficial necrosis of the skin paddle. Surgical debridement was done one week later. The flap was completely viable after surgery, and the contour of the foot was restored. We found that an improvement of sensation occurred in those patients in whom the anesthesia started one year ago or less and no sensory recovery in patient in whom the anesthesia had lasted for more than two years. Conclusion: The reverse <b>sural</b> <b>artery</b> flap with posterior tibial neurovascular decompression provides a reliable method for recurrent foot soft tissue reconstruction in leprosy patients with encouraging function and aesthetic outcomes. It is a quick and easy procedure...|$|R
40|$|Background: Skin {{coverage}} for defects {{in the lower}} 2 / 3 of leg, ankle region and posterior heel {{has always been a}} difficult challenge for reconstructive surgeon. Methods: We describe our experience with the distally based superficial <b>sural</b> <b>artery</b> flap coverage in 48 patients with moderate sized defects in these difficult areas. Results: One out of 48 flaps (in 48 patients) was lost totally and 3 suffered marginal necrosis which did not require any secondary procedure. These complications could have been avoided by proper selection of cases and refining technical skills. Conclusion: This simple procedure could be an important and versatile tool for any reconstructive surgeon in providing skin coverage in the distal leg and proximal foot. Preservation of major arteries of the lower limb, minimal donor defect, relatively uninjured donor area in compound fracture or poly trauma involving distal leg are some of the advantages of the flap...|$|R
40|$|Wounds of {{the hands}} and fingers are a com-mon {{challenge}} for most hand surgeons, and frequently, the wounds are complex and extensive.

These ideas are good in theory, but the flap donor sites are far from the hand. There are possible reconstructive op-tions that could be undertaken in the upper limb...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Defects of {{the foot}} and ankle with exposed tendons or bone require either local or free flap coverage. Several {{publications}} {{in recent years have}} proven popularity of fasciocutaneous flaps for the coverage of defects {{of the foot}} and ankle. However, complications of these flaps are being discussed rarely in literatures. Material and Method: We used distally based superficial <b>sural</b> <b>artery</b> island flaps, distally based lateral supramalleolar flaps and free thoracodorsal artery perforator (TDAP) flaps for the reconstruction of dorsal foot defects in 20 patients between 2005 and 2010. The surgical techniques and complications for each of fasciocutaneous flaps are discussed. Result: Better results were obtained with free TDAP flaps according to the other fasciocutaneous flaps. Discussion: As compared to other flaps, the free TDAP flap is a reliable flap with consistent anatomy and a long, constant pedicle diameter. Its versatility, in which thickness and volume may be adjusted, leads to a perfect match for reconstruction of dorsal foot defects...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} {{of use of}} the integument of themedial calf as a free flap donor site based on musculocutaneous branches of the medial sural vessels was first investigated in cadaver dissections by Taylor and Daniel. 1 Montegut and Allen 2 presented this at a regional meeting as a local flap alterna-tive to the gastrocnemius myocutaneous flap. At the 5 th International Course on Perforator Flaps in Gent, Belgium (2001), the anatomical basis of the requisite perforators to the medial <b>sural</b> <b>artery</b> flap was given as a free paper, 3 immediately followed by Cavadas et al explaining their clinical series in using this as a free flap. 4 Since then, these original anatomical findings have been verified, 5 – 8 and clinical applications as a thin perforator flap have run the gamut throughout the body proving versatility {{in the head and}} neck 9, 10 to the distal extremities, 5, 9, 11 – 14 indeed head...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Gastrocnemius {{muscle is}} a {{workhorse}} flap to cover upper third tibial defects {{but has a}} limitation in covering middle one-third tibial defects. The inferiorly based hemi gastrocnemius muscle flap can be useful for reconstruction of the middle third of the leg. The arterial communication between the gastrocnemius muscle heads has been demonstrated, the consistent location, however, was not studied in large specimens. Materials and Methods: This study was conducted on sixty specimens of gastrocnemius muscles harvested from thirty fresh cadavers to determine arterial communication between two heads of gastrocnemius muscle using radio-opaque contrast with future application of taking one head of muscle distally based for coverage of middle third defect of tibia. A total of 60 specimens were obtained from thirty fresh cadavers. In thirty specimens, medial <b>sural</b> <b>artery</b> ligated and divided and 20 ml iohexol (350) given through popliteal artery. In remaining thirty specimens lateral <b>sural</b> <b>artery</b> ligated and divided and 20 ml iohexol (350) given through popliteal artery. Digital X-rays of gastrocnemius muscle specimens were taken, and collaterals between two bellies in lower half were noted and the distance of collaterals from the muscles top edge was also noted. Results: We found the communications between both bellies of the gastrocnemius muscle in all specimens in both legs. The mean distance of communications from the upper edge of the medial belly was 15. 88 cm and from upper edge of the lateral belly was 14. 72 cm in the right leg, respectively. The mean distance of communications from upper edge of the medial belly was 16. 01 cm and from upper edge of the lateral belly was 13. 78 cm in the left leg. The distal communications between gastrocnemius bellies were not constant in their location, but all the connections were present in distal 3. 79 cm of raphe. Conclusion: This study supports the future application of inferior-based hemigastrocnemius muscles flap to cover defects of middle third leg. When distally based hemigastrocnemius flap is planned roughly 1 / 3 rd of distal attachment or distal 3. 79 cm of connection between raphe should be maintained to preserve the vascular communications between the two bellies...|$|R
40|$|Microsurgical free tissue {{transfer}} {{is a valuable}} technique for the reconstruction of soft-tissue defects around the knee, and the medial <b>sural</b> <b>artery</b> (MSA) is an ideal recipient vessel for anastomosis. Previously, the vessel {{has been described as}} the dominant supply to the medial gastrocnemius, but no research has addressed the subsequent effect to the muscle after interruption of MSA. The volume of the postoperative medial gastrocnemius of 4 patients treated with free flap reconstruction using MSA as recipient, was assessed clinically and using magnetic resonance imaging, with muscle function assessed using a patient questionnaire, and measurement of ankle torque with concurrent electromyography. Magnetic resonance imaging volume assessment revealed the postoperative medial head of gastrocnemius proportional to its synergist of separate blood supply, the lateral gastrocnemius and functional assessment suggest little difference between limbs such that the MSA should be used with confidence as recipient vessel for free flap reconstruction of soft-tissue defects around the knee.

30|$|Ever since Ponten first {{reported}} the fasciocutaneous flap {{from the lower}} leg in [13], the vascularization of the sural region of the lower leg has been extensively investigated, and the concepts of neurocutaneous, neuro-veno-fasciocutaneous, and fasciomusculocutaneous flaps have been realized [1, 12, 14 – 18]. Nakajima et al. [19] described that accompanying arteries of the lesser saphenous vein and sural nerve gave off venocutaneous and neurocutaneous perforators which nourish the skin from the calf down to the ankle. Based on this concept, Nakajima et al. [14] considered that raised flaps were based only on the circulation from the accompanying artery of the lesser saphenous vein, thus preserving the sural nerve and the sensation along the lateral border of the foot. Anatomical studies showed that the major blood supplies of neurocutaneous flaps are the segmental arteries of the cutaneous nerve along the cutaneous nerve trunk [6, 20]. Two intraneural and paraneural vascular networks with a vertical chain-like anastomosis guarantee a long-distance supply [21]. The distally based superficial <b>sural</b> <b>artery</b> flap {{is one of these}} neurocutaneous flaps, and its circulation depends on the anastomosis of the perisural nerve vasculature with distal perforators of the peroneal artery near the lateral malleolus. Zhang et al. [22] demonstrated that {{there are two kinds of}} nutrient vessels of the lesser saphenous vein (the nutrient vessels of nerve–vein and vein–nerve) which constitute the para-vein vascular trunk and the vein–wall vascular plexus of the lesser saphenous vein. In this study, we identified the arterial anatomy of the upper lateral leg and found that the superficial <b>sural</b> <b>artery</b> was the major supply vessel. In addition, 3 – 5 musculocutaneous perforators of the posterior tibial artery were identified at the middle one-third of the leg, with the biggest giving off several branches to bridge the perforators of the peroneal artery. In the lower half of the leg, we observed the intermuscular branches of the peroneal artery along with the largest terminal branch of the peroneal artery at the lateral supramalleolar. These findings provided the vascular basis for flap design. Distally based compound flaps (including musculocutaneous, fasciomusculocutaneous, osteocutaneous, and myo-osteocutaneous flaps) of the sural nerve and lesser saphenous vein have been used for the repair and coverage of lower leg ulcers, osteomyelitis, bone exposures, and exposed internal hardware [6, 12].|$|R
30|$|The CTA volumes were {{segmented}} {{using the}} Vitrea 6.7. 4 software (Vital Images, Inc., Minnetonka, MN, USA) into skin, bone, muscle, and vascular models by the consultant radiologist. The vascular models were produced with segmentations of both venous and arterial vessels {{of the lower}} leg. Where appropriate, the trunks of the medial <b>sural</b> <b>artery</b> perforators (MSAPs) were segmented together with the associated site of perforation through the muscle fascia. The lengths of the trunk and its branches were calculated using the Vitrea built-in vascular tools and the approximate site of each perforator was measured relative to the medial femoral epicondyle. Skin segmentations were performed using the Vitrea autoskin function, whereby a combination of voxel thresholding and morphological operations rapidly identifies the outer tissue layer. This facilitates accurate hands-free registration of models to their respective patients. In addition, the bone segmentations allowed for accurate correlation with anatomical landmarks such as the tibial tuberosity. Before surgery, each case was discussed with the surgical team to explain the models and anatomy and to confirm the choice of perforator. It was not uncommon to mark a selection of perforators so that a decision could be made {{at the time of}} surgery.|$|R
40|$|Abstract––When humans voluntarily and maximally {{contract}} {{a muscle}} under isometric conditions, the average firing rate of motor units decreases from an initially high value over several tens of seconds. The mechanisms underlying the rate reduction are probably manifold. One mechanism could involve {{changes in the}} motoneuron afterhyperpolarization, another reflex eVects of group III–IV muscle aVerents that are excited during developing muscle fatigue. It appears possible that changes in motoneuron afterhyper-polarization are mediated by these aVerent inputs. We therefore studied eVects on motoneuron afterhyperpolarization of small-diameter muscle aVerents excited by intra-arterially injected metabolites such as bradykinin and serotonin. In decerebrate and mostly spinalized cats, lumbosacral á-motoneurons were recorded intracellularly. Current pulses were injected to test for input resistance and elicit action potentials and afterhyperpolarizations. Afterhyperpolarizations were averaged from c. 10 successive stimulus repetitions. Measurements were taken of afterhyperpolarization amplitude, half-width and area; and exponential functions were fitted to the afterhyperpolarization decay phase to determine afterhyper-polarization decay time-constants. In selected cases, the entire afterhyperpolarization trajectory was fitted with a sum of two exponentials to assess more precisely changes in afterhyperpolarization trajectory. Small catheters were inserted into side-branches of the <b>sural</b> <b>artery</b> and the accompanying vein to appl...|$|R
