25|$|With {{the help}} of French experts, he {{organized}} a system of indirect taxation, which provided the state with more revenue than direct taxation. Frederick the Great commissioned Johann Ernst Gotzkowsky to promote the trade and — {{to take on the}} competition with France — put a <b>silk</b> <b>factory</b> where soon 1,500 people found employment. Frederick the Great followed his recommendations in the field of toll levies and import restrictions. In 1763 when Gotzkowsky went broke during a financial crisis, which started in Amsterdam, Frederick took over his porcelain factory, known as KPM, but refused to buy more of his paintings.|$|E
25|$|Achille Ratti {{was born}} in Desio, in the {{province}} of Milan, in 1857, the son of an owner of a <b>silk</b> <b>factory.</b> He was ordained a priest in 1879 and embarked on an academic career within the Church. He obtained three doctorates (in philosophy, canon law and theology) at the Gregorian University in Rome, and then from 1882 to 1888 was a professor at the seminary in Padua. His scholarly specialty was as an expert paleographer, a student of ancient and medieval Church manuscripts. Eventually, he left seminary teaching to work full-time at the Ambrosian Library in Milan, from 1888 to 1911.|$|E

25|$|In 1844, {{she joined}} the Northampton Association of Education and Industry in Northampton, Massachusetts. Founded by abolitionists, the {{organization}} supported women's rights and religious tolerance as well as pacifism. There were, in its four-and-a-half year history, a total of 240 members, though no more than 120 at any one time. They lived on , raising livestock, running a sawmill, a gristmill, and a <b>silk</b> <b>factory.</b> While there, Truth met William Lloyd Garrison, Frederick Douglass, and David Ruggles. In 1846, the group disbanded, unable to support itself. In 1845, {{she joined the}} household of George Benson, the brother-in-law of William Lloyd Garrison. In 1849, she visited John Dumont before he moved west.|$|E
25|$|The first {{beginnings}} of the factories came in 1402. Giovanni di Bicci began a partnership to run a wool factory with an experienced manager, Michele di Baldo di ser Michele. This first wool shop {{was followed by a}} second one in 1408, this time with Taddeo di Filippo. The first one was ended in 1420; de Roover speculates that it was poorly run and so not very profitable. Eventually another one was opened in 1439; the original eventually came to an end between 1458 and 1469 for unknown reasons ("probably because of the manager's death."). The last shop was apparently being liquidated in 1480 amidst a general decline in the Florentine textile industry, and does not appear again in the tax records. The silk shop is known to have not existed before 1430; the libro segreto ("secret records", the second set of books kept to record partners' profits, and generally more accurate than the public books, inasmuch as they state the real profits and losses and which depositers were real) mention that they entered into a short partnership with two silk manufacturers. When the partnership ended, one of the two manufacturers became the manager of the <b>silk</b> <b>factory</b> until his death in 1446 or 1447. The silk shop endured until 1480, when the last descendant of that partner died.|$|E
25|$|Signs of a {{recovering}} economy emerged slowly under the Portuguese economic renewal policy. The city grew gradually to 250,000 inhabitants who settled in all geographical directions, occupying the new neighbourhoods of Estrella and Rato, while its new industrial centre concentrated around the recent water supply {{brought by the}} aqueduct to the water tower of Alcântara. Many factories arose in the area, including the royal ceramic factory and the <b>silk</b> <b>factory</b> of Amoreiras, where mulberry trees were grown to provide leaves to feed the larvae of the silkworms used by the local silk factories. The Prime Minister tried continually to stimulate the rise of middle class, which he saw as essential to the country's development and progress. The first cafes owned by Italians were founded in the city around this time: some survive today such as Martinho da Arcada (1782) in the Palace Square and the Nicola in Rossio Square, whose Liberal owner, among others, illuminated the façade after each Progressive political victory. The richest burghers acquired the habit of holding social soirées, with the unprecedented participation of women, while among the conservative nobility women held their traditional place and did not participate. In this manner a self-conscious bourgeois middle class rose again from the people of Lisbon, composed of both New Christians and Old Christians; these were {{the source of the}} national Liberal and Republican political movements, their presence manifested by the publication of several new newspapers in the capital.|$|E

50|$|Urban {{development}} {{continued to}} expand and {{change the face of}} the city, with the silk-processing industry playing a dominant role in the economy. By the end of the 19th century Lyon had 310 <b>silk</b> <b>factories</b> with 210,000 workers, and 320 silk traders. Exports went mainly to North America and England, but even to India and China.|$|R
500|$|The {{population}} of Middlewich rose during the 19th and 20th centuries. Some of this rise {{is attributable to}} a number of parishes being combined, for example parts of Newton were added to Middlewich in 1894, with Sutton having previously been added to Newton in 1892. [...] Some will also be due to a general increase in {{population of}} the United Kingdom, and some of the increase would have been required to provide a labour force for the increased number, and scale, of salt and chemical works in the town. In the middle of the 19th century Middlewich was described as a town with principal works being the surrounding farming district, a <b>silk</b> <b>factory,</b> and the salt works in Kinderton and Newton.|$|E

Inside the complex, visitors could see signposts to major landmarks accessible by the tunnels, such as Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City, and could see chambers labeled with their original functions, such as cinemas, hospitals, or arsenals. A portrait of Mao Zedong could be seen amidst murals of locals volunteering to dig the tunnels and fading slogans such as [...] "Accumulate Grain", and [...] "For the People: Prepare for War, Prepare for Famine". [...] Rooms with bunk beds and decayed cardboard boxes of water purifiers {{could be seen in}} areas not open to tourists. Visitors on the official tour would also pass by a functioning <b>silk</b> <b>factory</b> in one of the underground staff meeting rooms of the complex, and be given a demonstration of the process of obtaining silk from silkworm cocoons.

2500|$|Shusha {{sits on a}} mountaintop {{overlooking}} the NKR's highly populated capital, Stepanakert (just 5km away), from an elevation of 600m. An old fortress with high walls, the town is five kilometers (four miles) {{to the south of}} Stepanakert and perched on a mountaintop with limited vehicular access to reach it. From a geographical standpoint Shusha was well-suited for Azerbaijani shelling of Stepanakert. The main type of artillery used in the bombardment, which began on January 10, 1992, was the Soviet-made BM-21 GRAD multiple rocket launcher, which was capable of firing 40 rockets in one volley. The GRAD launcher was similar to the World War II-era Katyusha in that it did not have a guided missile system and hence the location of where it would hit was difficult to determine. Dubbed [...] "flying telephone poles" [...] due to their long, shaped charges, the missiles caused devastating damage to buildings including the destruction of residential houses, schools, the city's <b>silk</b> <b>factory</b> and maternity hospital.|$|E
2500|$|Flintshire - A {{subsidiary}} of a German company, the British Glanzstoff Manufacturing Company started an artificial <b>silk</b> <b>factory</b> in Flint in 1907. During World War I the factory closed down but {{was taken over}} by Courtaulds in 1917. In 1913, the company had started making the synthetic fibre viscose rayon, made from cellulose derived from imported wood pulp or cotton waste. Courtaulds in September 1919 bought the old Muspratt Alkali factory in Flint from United Alkali Co Ltd and called it Castle Works, where after conversion they started production in 1922 of manufactured viscose rayon yarn. Courtaulds also in December 1927 bought the Holywell Textile Mill in Flint which they called Deeside Mill and after reconstruction and alterations was used for yarn processing. At its height Courtaulds employed over 10,000 people at four sites. At Greenfield, some [...] further down the Dee estuary, two additional large rayon production facilities existed from 1936 onwards, named Number 1 and Number 2. These mills employed over 3,000 people. Textile production declined from 1950, and Aber works shut initially in 1957, opened for rayon in 1966, and pulled down in 1984. Castle works closed in 1977 and Deeside Mill in 1989. The number 1 facility at Greenfield was mothballed in 1978, and the entire site was decommissioned in the mid 1980s.|$|E
60|$|I could {{pour out}} on the reader many other Pisan statistics, but they would be at second-hand. After long vicissitude, the city is again almost as prosperous as {{she was in the}} heyday of her {{national}} greatness, when she had commerce with every Levantine and Oriental port. We ourselves saw a <b>silk</b> <b>factory</b> pouring forth a tide of pretty girls from their work {{at the end of the}} day; there was no ruin or disrepair noticeable anywhere, and the whole city was as clean as Rome, with streets paved with broad, smooth flagstones where you never missed the rubber tires which your carriage failed of. But Pisa had a great air of resting, of taking life easily after a tumultuous existence in the long past which she had put behind her. Throughout the Middle Ages she was always fighting foreign foes without her walls or domestic factions within, now the Saracens wherever she could find them or they could find her, now the Normans in Naples, now the Cor-sicans and Sardinians, now Lucca, now Genoa, now Florence, and now all three. Her wars with these republics were really incessant; they were not so much wars as battles in one long war, with a peace occasionally made during the five or ten or fifteen years, which was no better than a truce. When she fell under the Medici, together with her enemy Florence, she shared the death-quiet the tyrants brought that prepotent republic, and it was the Medicean strength probably which saved her from Lucca and Genoa, though it left them to continue republics down to the nineteenth century. She was at one time an oligarchy, and at another a democracy, and at another the liege of this prince or that priest, but she was never out of trouble as long as she possessed independence or the shadow of it. In the safe hold of united Italy she now sits by her Arno and draws long, deep breaths, which you may almost hear as you pass; and I hope the prospect of increasing prosperity will not tempt her to work too hard. It does not look as if it would.|$|E

40|$|Based upon a {{wide range}} of archive records, the article covers issues {{relating}} to particular aspects of life and living standards of <b>silk</b> weaving <b>factory</b> workers’ families in a village of Fryanovo of Moskovski county in XVIII — fi rst quarter of XIX centuries. Workers’ daily life was signifi cantly infl uenced by living conditions. It is via this article that we analyze dimensions and types of living premises provided to workers by the factory owners, as well as its improvements. The Fryanovo factory offi ce records that remain intact allow consideration of issues relating to food for workers, including sources for providing Fryanovo inhabitants with bread and other food products, the composition and the average amount thereof. One chapter of the article is specifi cally devoted to workers’ worship service attendance, as well as diff erences in religion belief of Fryanovo inhabitants. In addition to the orthodox Christian majority of its population, there were also Catholics and Old Believers among its inhabitants. The issues directly relating to working at the <b>silk</b> weaving <b>factory</b> include work schedule and rules, average age of workers, wage payment methods, as well as workers motivation by the <b>silk</b> weaving <b>factory</b> owner. Considered are the issues relating to employment of children and women at the <b>silk</b> weaving <b>factory.</b> An important part of the research relates to living conditions of non-working population groups: young children, retired and handicaps who were given some money or bread, on monthly bases, by <b>silk</b> weaving <b>factory</b> owners. Medical services for the <b>silk</b> weaving <b>factory</b> workers, personal taxation and other fees, participation by factory workers, in recruitments, penalties and fi nes system as implemented by the <b>silk</b> weaving <b>factory</b> in Fryanovo are also within the spectrum of questions that are discussed within the article.
