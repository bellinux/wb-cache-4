50|$|The {{most basic}} recipe calls for slowly {{simmering}} milk and sugar, <b>stirring</b> almost <b>constantly,</b> although other ingredients such as vanilla may be added for flavour. Much {{of the water}} in the milk evaporates and the mix thickens; the resulting dulce de leche is usually about a sixth of the volume of the milk used.

50|$|The pigment was {{originally}} prepared {{by making a}} solution of sodium carbonate at a temperature of around 90 °C, then slowly adding arsenious oxide, while <b>constantly</b> <b>stirring</b> until everything had dissolved. This produced a sodium arsenite solution. Added to a copper sulfate solution, it produced a green precipitate of effectively insoluble copper arsenite. After filtration the product was dried at about 43 °C. To enhance the color, the salt was subsequently heated to 60-70 °C. The intensity of the color depends on the copper : arsenic ratio, which in turn was affected by {{the ratio of the}} starting materials, as well as the temperature.|$|R
50|$|The rice {{is first}} cooked briefly in a soffritto of onion and butter or olive oil, to coat each grain {{in a film}} of fat, called tostatura; white wine is added and must be absorbed by the grains. When it has been absorbed the heat is raised to medium high, and boiling stock is {{gradually}} added in small amounts, while <b>stirring</b> <b>constantly.</b> The constant stirring, with {{only a small amount}} of liquid present, forces the grains to rub against each other and release the starch molecules from the outside of the grains into the surrounding liquid, creating a smooth creamy-textured mass. When the rice is cooked the pot is taken off the heat for mantecatura, vigorously beating in refrigerated balls of grated parmesan cheese and butter, to make the texture as creamy and smooth as possible. It may be removed from the heat a few minutes earlier and left to cook with its residual heat.|$|E
5000|$|Burmese tofu (တိုဖူး; [...] or [...] ) is a food of Shan origin, {{made from}} water and flour ground from yellow split peas and the Burmese version of {{chickpea}} flour, {{also known as}} besan flour, in a fashion similar to polenta. The flour is mixed with water, turmeric, and a little salt and heated, <b>stirring</b> <b>constantly,</b> until it reaches a creamy consistency. It is then transferred into a tray and allowed to set. It can also be made using dried chickpea instead of processed flour. In this process, dried chickpeas are soaked overnight. Once the peas have been re-hydrated, they are pureed {{in a food processor}} with some of the liquid used to soak the peas, then allowed to set for a couple of hours. Much of the top layer of clear liquid is then skimmed off and the remaining puree is brought to a boil with turmeric and salt and cooked and set {{in the same manner as}} the version using chickpea flour. It is matte yellow in colour, jelly-like but firm in consistency, and does not crumble when cut or sliced. It may be eaten fresh as a salad or deep fried. It may also be sliced and dried to make crackers for deep frying. Despite the name, Burmese tofu is unrelated to Chinese tofu, which is made from soy milk with added coagulants.|$|E

5000|$|Dark roux: The Cajuns {{inherited}} the roux from the French. However, unlike the French, {{it is made}} with oil or bacon fat and more lately olive oil, however, not normally with butter. It {{is used as a}} thickening agent, especially in gumbo and étouffée. Preparation of a dark roux is probably the most involved or complicated procedure in Cajun cuisine, involving heating fat and flour very carefully, <b>constantly</b> <b>stirring</b> for about 15-45 minutes (depending on the color of the desired product), until the mixture has darkened in color and developed a nutty flavor. The temperature should not be too high, as a burnt roux renders a dish unpalatable.|$|R
50|$|During {{the day the}} goby {{rests on}} the burrow floor, half out of the opening, or may make forays further afield to feed. It eats small {{invertebrates}} that it picks out of the sediment that has been disturbed by the shrimp or takes mouthfuls of sediment and extracts any edible matter. The shrimp is mainly a detritus feeder and is <b>constantly</b> <b>stirring</b> up the substrate. The shrimp cannot see well and extends its antennae behind the goby which uses a flick of its tail to alert the shrimp to approaching fish whereupon the shrimp rapidly retreats. The goby distinguishes between predators, bottom-stirring fish that may damage the burrow and harmless species and reacts appropriately. When the goby takes fright and swims into the burrow head first, the shrimp darts in immediately.|$|R
5000|$|Dark roux: A dark roux, {{with its}} strong (dense) nutty flavor will {{completely}} overpower a simple seafood gumbo, {{but is the}} perfect complement to a gumbo using chicken, sausage, crawfish or alligator. Chicken will just settle into the darker flavor, while sausage and dark roux balance each other well. A dark roux is approximately the color of milk chocolate. Preparing a dark roux is complicated. It involves heating oil or fat and flour very carefully, <b>constantly</b> <b>stirring</b> for 15-45 minutes (depending on the darkness desired), until the mixture has turned quite dark and developed a rich, nutty flavor and smell. It's very easy to burn the flour as it moves toward a darker brown, and burnt roux renders a dish unpalatable. A heavy-bottomed pot can help protect the roux from burning.|$|R

30|$|Homogenous {{and uniform}} ZnO {{nanoparticles}} were deposited using the sol–gel spin coating method [28]. Before seed layer deposition, the ZnO solution was prepared using {{zinc acetate dihydrate}} [Zn (CH 3 COO) 2 [*]·[*] 2 H 2 O] as a precursor and monoethanolamine (MEA) as a stabilizer. In this study, methanol (MeOH), ethanol (EtOH), isopropanol (IPA), and 2 -methoxyethanol (2 -ME) were used as solvents. All of the chemicals were used without further purification. ZnO sol (0.2  M) was obtained by mixing 4.4  g of zinc acetate dihydrate with 100  ml of solvent. To ensure that the zinc powder was completely dissolved in the solvent, the mixed solution was stirred on a hot plate at 60 °C for 20  min. Then, 1.2216  g of MEA was gradually added to the ZnO solution, while <b>stirring</b> <b>constantly</b> at 60 °C for 2  h. The milky solution was then changed into a homogenous and transparent ZnO solution. The solution was stored for 24  h to age at room temperature (RT) before deposition.|$|E

30|$|In {{the next}} set of experiments, we {{synthesized}} four separate aqueous solution of PVP which were prepared by dissolving 0, 1.5, 3.5, and 5.5 g of polymer in 100 ml of deionized water at 363 K before mixing 0.2 mmol of iron nitrate and 0.1 mmol of nickel nitrate (Fe/Ni = 2 : 1) into the polymer solution and <b>constantly</b> <b>stirring</b> for 2 h using a magnetic stirrer until a colorless, transparent solution was obtained. A glass electrode was used to determine the pH of the solution, which ranged from 1 to 2. No precipitation of materials was observed before the heat treatment. The mixed solution was poured into a glass Petri dish and heated at 353 K in an oven for 24 h to evaporate the water. The dried, orange, solid nickel ferrite that remained was crushed and ground in a mortar to form powder. The calcination of the powders was conducted at 723 K for 3 h for the decomposition of organic compounds and the crystallization of the nanocrystals.|$|R
50|$|The {{ingredients}} {{often include}} butter or margarine, molasses, sugar, and sometimes white vinegar. The molasses {{is the critical}} ingredient, for it is less sweet than sugar and has a slightly bitter flavour that gives bonfire toffee its unique taste. One recipe calls for 230 g of butter, 230 g of treacle, and 450 g of brown sugar. The mixture is cooked {{over medium heat until}} melted, and allowed to boil (while <b>constantly</b> <b>stirring</b> rapidly) for 15 minutes. The hot mixture is then poured into buttered forms (such as a cake pan or special forms). Recipes calling for the use of vinegar vary these ingredients. For example, one recipe from 1922 calls for 550 g of dark brown sugar, 280 ml of molasses, one tablespoon (15 ml) of vinegar, one tablespoon (15 ml) of butter, and one teaspoon (5 ml) of sodium bicarbonate (or baking soda). White vinegar gives the toffee a slightly sharper taste, and alters the chemistry of the toffee so that it is not so brittle. It also helps the toffee to set. Other recipes call for about 5 imppt L of water, and vary the amount of the other ingredients. Some recipes call for the use of golden syrup (In the US this is light molasses mixed with corn syrup) instead of molasses/treacle.|$|R
5000|$|Lawrence had a {{sinister}} reputation in France, both {{during his lifetime}} and even today, being seen as an implacable [...] "enemy of France"; {{the man who was}} supposedly <b>constantly</b> <b>stirring</b> up the Syrians to revolt against French rule throughout the 1920s. The French historian Maurice Larès wrote that the real reason for France's problems in Syria was that the Syrians {{did not want to be}} ruled by France, and the French needed a [...] "scapegoat" [...] to blame for their difficulties in ruling the country. Larès wrote that far from being a Francophobe, as he is usually depicted in France, Lawrence was really a Francophile. Larès wrote: [...] "But we should note that a man rarely devotes much of his time and effort to the study of a language and of the literature of a people he hates, unless this is in order to work for its destruction (Eichmann's behavior may be an instance of this), which was clearly not Lawrence's case. Had Lawrence really disliked the French, would he, even for financial reasons, have translated French novels into English? The quality of his translation of Le Gigantesque (The Forest Giant) reveals not only his conscientiousness as an artist but also a knowledge of French that can scarcely have derived from unfriendly feelings". Larès concluded that the popular thesis in France that Lawrence had [...] "virulent anti-French prejudices" [...] is not supported by the facts.|$|R
40|$|Achieving a {{desirable}} percutaneous absorption of drug molecule {{is a major}} concern in formulating dermatological products. The use of penetration enhancers could provide a successful mean for this purpose. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect ofincorporating a few common penetration enhancers (in different concentrations) into a 0. 5 % w/w piroxicam (model drug) gel formulation, on the permeability rate of drug through rat abdominal skin in vitro. For this purpose various concentrations of oleic acid (OA), urea (UR), lecithin (LEC) and isopropyl myristate (IPM) were used as the penetration enhancer. In order to investigate the effect of penetration enhancers used in this study on the permeability rate of piroxicam through sections of excised rat skin, Franz-type diffusion cells were employed. The receptor phase was <b>constantly</b> <b>stirring</b> 0. 9 % w/v sodium chloride solution at 32 °C. At setintervals up to 8 h, 5 ml samples were removed from the receptor compartment and the amount of piroxicam permeated through the skin calculated by determining the UV absorbance of drug at 353 nm. Results show that among the penetration enhancers used, the use of OA at a concentration of 1. 0 % w/w had the greatest effect on the permeability rate of piroxicam, and produced the highest enhancement ratio among all the penetration enhancers examined. The other penetration enhancers used were found to have a far smaller effect on the permeability rate of piroxicam through rat skin. The enhancement ratio of the penetration enhancers used in the formulation of piroxicam gel were found to increase in the order of OA>> IPM > LEC > UR...|$|R
30|$|A solution–imidization {{technique}} was utilized to synthesize organo-soluble polyimide (6 FDA– 6 FpDA–COOH) with carboxylic acid end groups [28]. The molecular weight and end group functionality were {{controlled by the}} reactant stoichiometry. Firstly, 2.01  g (0.006  mol) of 4, 4 ′-(hexafluoroisopropylidene)dianiline (6 FpDA) was added into a 100 -ml three-necked round-bottom flask, and 29.1  ml of NMP was used to dissolve the reactants. 5.331  g (0.012  mol) of 4, 4 ′-(hexafluoroisopropylidene)diphthalic anhydride (6 FDA) was then slowly added into the above solution with vigorous stirring under nitrogen purging. The mixture was allowed to react for 8  h at room temperature. Secondly, 1.6457  g (0.012  mol) of 4 -aminobenzoic acid (4 ABA) and 7.2  ml of 1, 3 -dichlorobenzene {{were added to the}} above solution. The 20  wt% of poly(amic acid) (PAA) solution was thus formed after <b>constantly</b> <b>stirring</b> the reactants for 16  h at room temperature. The PAA solution was then thermally imidized in a 1800  °C silicon oil bath for another 8  h and cooled to room temperature. The homogeneous 6 FDA– 6 FpDA– 4 ABA–COOH solution was precipitated with 500  ml of methanol and re-dissolved in 30  ml of THF twice. A white-gray precipitate was recovered and dried in a vacuum oven at 1500  °C for 24  h to obtain 2.136  g of 6 FDA– 6 FpDA– 4 ABA–COOH (yield, 23.8  %). The average acid value of 6 FDA– 6 FpDA– 4 ABA–COOH was found to be 14  mg KOH/ 0.5  g polyimide using titration. The average molecular weight estimated by the acid value was around 4000. The weight average molecular weight estimated by GPC was 4276 with a polydispersity index of 1.31. It is noted that the yield of 6 FDA– 6 FpDA– 4 ABA–COOH could be improved to nearly 50  % if monomers 6 FDA, 6 FpDA, and 4 ABA were purified at 244 – 247, 195 – 198, and 187 – 189  °C, respectively, by sublimation/condensation procedure before the polyimide synthesis. The 6 FDA– 6 FpDA– 4 ABA–COOH film was prepared using the following procedure: 0.5  g of 6 FDA– 6 FpDA– 4 ABA–COOH was dissolved in 5  ml of DMAc while being stirred. The solution was filtered with a 0.45 -m PTFE filter prior to use and spin-coated on to a silicon wafer at 1000  rpm for 20  s. The film was then baked at 60  °C on a hot plate for 10  min and at 150  °C for another 30  min to evaporate the solvent. The characteristic peaks of the FTIR spectrum for IB 0 were observed as follows: 3434  cm− 1 (COOH), 1788  cm− 1 (CO), 1726  cm− 1 (CO), 1610  cm− 1 (C 6 H 5), 1517  cm− 1 (C 6 H 5), 1438  cm− 1 (C 6 H 5), and 1370  cm− 1 (CN) [28]. Next, the IBX hybrid solutions were prepared. The PI was mixed with different weight ratios of BaTiO 3 (0, 2, 5, 8, 10, and 12  wt%, i.e., IB 0 –IB 12) in DMAc solvent and stirred uniformly to form the IBX hybrid solution. To prepare the IBX hybrid thin films, the precursor solution was spin-coated onto a silicon substrate. Finally, the hybrid dielectric thin films were baked at 60  °C for 30  min, 100  °C for 30  min, and 150  °C for 60  min [28 – 30].|$|R
40|$|In {{these studies}} normal guinea pigs {{were exposed to}} tuberculous cage mates in two {{different}} degrees of crowding, some in ordinary cages, where the food became contaminated with the excreta, laden with tubercle bacilli, of the inoculated animals, and some in special cages with wire-mesh floors, where these excreta were largely excluded {{as a source of}} contagion. The results are summarized in Table V. In all these experiments crowding has always increased the incidence of the disease both in the ordinary and the special cages. However, due to the accident of eating of tuberculous animals in the more crowded cages these results are not conclusive, but they are in accord with the results of the previous study (2). It was found that the incidence of tuberculosis was lower among the guinea pigs exposed to contagion in the special cages, in which little of the contaminated excreta remained in direct contact with the normal animals. In fact in the less crowded special cages the incidence of tuberculosis was only a little higher than among the same total number of guinea pigs exposed {{at the same time in}} the same room but not confined with tuberculous cage mates. In the special cages, especially in the less crowded, where nearly all the contaminated excreta were removed, the disease acquired was largely respiratory in origin and was characterized by an extensive tuberculosis of the tracheobronchial lymph nodes with little or no affection of the mesenteric nodes. The pulmonary disease in the guinea pigs that acquired tuberculosis in these cages was more often extensive than that acquired in the ordinary cages. However no definite evidence of primary lesions in the lung in the former was found, due to the dissemination of the disease at the time of death. The tuberculosis acquired by the contacts in the ordinary cages, on the other hand, was usually enteric in origin, although both routes were involved, especially in the less crowded cages. Moreover, a striking fact appears if we compare the course of tuberculosis in these two types of cages in both degrees of crowding: the contacts that developed tuberculosis in the ordinary cages survived an average of 106 and 114 days longer than the corresponding animals in the special cages. It is well known that the respiratory route is a far more dangerous avenue of infection in tuberculosis than the alimentary canal. This fact has again been clearly brought out in the recent studies of Bruno Lange and his associates (3), who have shown that although guinea pigs may occasionally be infected by way of the mouth with quantities as low as 0. 000, 001 mg. of virulent tubercle bacilli they often escape infection even when fed 0. 1 mg. or more. On the other hand if guinea pigs are made to inhale even the smallest quantities of tubercle bacilli they regularly contract tuberculosis. Furthermore they have also shown that the alimentary infection produces a disease far more chronic in character than that acquired by the respiratory route. It would therefore seem that the more acute type of disease is acquired in the special cages because in these cages the respiratory route plays by far the more important rô 1 e whereas in the ordinary cages the disease is largely of enteric origin. However, it appears that in the ordinary cages where the guinea pigs were <b>constantly</b> <b>stirring</b> up their sawdust or peat-moss bedding, laden with tubercle bacilli, there was an even greater opportunity for respiratory infection than in the special cages where there was no bedding at all and where most of the excreta were removed from immediate contact with the normal animals. That the respiratory mode of infection plays a rô 1 e even in the ordinary cages was shown in a previous communication (2) as well as in this paper. In both studies it was found that only in the more crowded ordinary cages is the disease almost entirely of enteric origin but in the less crowded ordinary cages infection takes place by the respiratory tract as well, though to a smaller degree than by the alimentary. It would therefore appear that in the ordinary cages both routes are open for infection but the relatively larger doses of tubercle bacilli ingested determine a disease of enteric origin and hence of a chronic nature, suppressing at the same time the engrafting of the disease by way of the lungs, and that in the special cages where the alimentary sources of infection have been reduced to a minimum, the disease is engrafted by way of the lungs and is therefore of more acute type. Although in the special cages the intensity of exposure even to tubercle bacilli entering by the respiratory tract is less than in the ordinary cages, nevertheless the disease so produced is more acute, presumably because the inhibitory or retarding effect of enteric infection upon the development of respiratory disease is absent. This explains the paradoxical effect observed of a greater incidence and a more chronic type of disease in the ordinary cages and a lower incidence and a more acute type of disease in the special cages, for the intensity of exposure by both routes is greater in the ordinary cages, and of the two, much greater by the enteric route...|$|R
