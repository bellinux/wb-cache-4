40|$|The {{splash plate}} <b>slurry</b> <b>spreader</b> is {{inexpensive}} and robust {{but it is}} not environmentally friendly. It releases most of the ammonia (NH 3) in slurry, emits strong odours and distributes the remaining nutrients unevenly. The object of this report is to identify improvements to slurry spreaders that may eliminate these shortcomings. Several gases are released during and after slurry spreading. NH 3 contributes to acidification of the environment and is emitted almost entirely from agriculture. Over 30 % of European NH 3 emissions come from slurry spreading. The Gothenberg agreement (UNECE, 1999) requires a reduction in national NH 3 emission to 8 % below 1990 levels. Emission of this gas from band, TF (trailing foot) and injector slurry spreaders is 40, 40 and 20 % respectively of that from conventional splash plate machines. A switch to spreaders with lower emissions would provide sufficient reduction to satisfy the Gothenberg objective. Odour from livestock units gives rise to many complaints but {{there is little evidence that}} it is a health hazard. Emission of the vapours from slurry spreaders is in the order; (splash plate) >(band) > (TF and injector). Other gases (methane and nitrous oxide) are released primarily after injection. Infection of humans by slurry-borne organisms is not common. In general the differences between spreaders in regard to pathogens are not significant but this conclusion may not apply in all cases. Slurry nutrients amount to 40 % of the N and 65 % of the P required in agriculture. Several commercial and experimental methods exist to measure slurry nutrient content. Field application using a splash plate and vacuum tanker gives highly variable distribution. Any of the other spreaders reviewed here combined with a fixed displacement pump achieve more uniform application. Accurate spreading reduces the need for excess application so losses to water from soil are reduced. This conforms to the Water Framework Directive. Deep injection and incorporation can reduce loss of P from slurry but other spreading methods will not normally reduce the risk of P loss at spreading time. The proposed tanker consists of a closed tank with running gear fit for road and field conditions. A TF spreader is fitted at the back. The slurry is handled by a fixed displacement pump which fills the tank or empties it through the spreader. The pump must be protected from obstacles so an intake filter or chopper filter should be included. This <b>slurry</b> <b>spreader</b> would reduce emission of NH 3 and odour and increase the recycling of slurry nutrients to crops. It is more expensive than splash plate machines but if widely adopted it could be an economical solution to the UNECE requirement to reduce NH 3 emissions. Alternatives to improving spreaders exist. These include digesting slurry, and reducing emissions from livestock housing and slurry storage. With the exception of digestion these offer poor prospects of success especially in relation to odour reduction and exploitation of slurry nutrients. The cost of providing this equipment on Irish farms is likely to be between € 200 m and € 800 m and depends on the options chosen. End of Project Repor...|$|E
40|$|Discussions with farmers using {{band and}} {{injection}} <b>slurry</b> <b>spreaders</b> {{suggested that the}} rate of breakdown due to blockages, in these machines, was approximately one per day. This report shows how the use of an intake filter and a modified distributor on a band spreader can reduce this problem. A set of obstacles was assembled on the basis of information from farmers and from literature. Ten classes of obstacles were selected, at random, and between size limits. Two prototype filters, a commercial filter and an open pipe were tested while drawing slurry from an open tank to a tanker. During each test, obstacles were thrown into the slurry stream. Obstacles retained by the filter were counted afterwards. A second filter trial was organised to test the tendency of filters to clog. Obstacle tests with 3 prototype distributors and a control were conducted in a similar manner to the first filter trial but, in this case, preliminary tests were conducted in water and final tests in slurry. The initial tests identified the best prototype. This was then compared to the control distributor using slurry. The open pipe allowed 80 % of obstacles to pass while the filters allowed only 4 – 19 % through. The new filters offered no improvement over the commercial unit. Filters required 16 hours agitation but the open pipe required 4 hours or less. The best prototype had the same diameter as the control but had an obstacle trap attached at the side. In a test using obstacles and slurry, the control was obstructed by 56 % of the obstacles while the prototype allowed only 21 % to cause a blockage. Flow through the prototype was initially too large. Slowing down the rotor in the distributor and restricting the outlet from the obstacle trap with a single long pipe, connected to two nozzles, controlled the flow. The results of the filter and distributor trials were combined. Of the seventy obstacles dropped above the filter, six passed through. Four of these caused blockages in the control distributor, but only one became stuck in the prototype. The blockage rate in the distributor and nozzles was significantly reduced compared to the original unit. End of Project Repor...|$|R
