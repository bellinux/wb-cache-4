50|$|A {{good example}} for {{producer}} responsibility organizations are the member organizations of PRO EUROPE. PRO EUROPE s.p.r.l. (Packaging Recovery Organisation Europe), founded in 1995, is the umbrella organization for European packaging and packaging waste recovery and recycling schemes. Product stewardship organizations like PRO EUROPE are intended to relieve industrial companies and commercial enterprises of their individual obligation to take back used products through the operation of an organization which fulfills these obligations on a nationwide basis {{on behalf of their}} member companies. The aim is to ensure the recovery and recycling of packaging waste in the most economically efficient and ecologically sound manner. In many countries, this is done through the Green Dot trademark of which PRO EUROPE is the general licensor. The Green Dot has evolved into a proven concept in many countries as implementation of Producer Responsibility. In twenty-five nations companies are now using the Green Dot as the financing symbol for the organization of recovery, sorting and recycling of <b>sales</b> <b>packaging.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Abony {{was part}} of the private equity {{syndicate}} that acquired Der Grüne Punkt (Green Dot) [...] "DSD" [...] from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in 2011. Abony sits on the board of DSD and is one of its largest shareholders. DSD was founded in 1990 and was the first company to introduce a dual take-back system in Germany, in response to the Packaging Ordinance & Waste Act. The Green Dot (German: Der Grüne Punkt) is the license symbol of a European network of industry-funded systems for recycling the packaging materials of consumer goods. The logo is trademark protected worldwide. DSD employs 247 people in Germany, and is considered the largest dual take-back systems provider in Europe. In 2009, DSD recovered approximately 2.75 million tons of <b>sales</b> <b>packaging,</b> saved 60 billion megajoules of energy and reduced CO2 emissions (and its equivalents) by 1.5 million tons. According to Reuters, DSD a former non-profit organization, had 2009 sales of 684 million euros ($943 million).|$|E
40|$|For a {{long time}} plastic {{packaging}} {{was considered to be}} a major problem in the <b>sales</b> <b>packaging</b> sector because of the apparently limited number of recovery and recycling techniques. Today, the situation has changed dramatically: Used plastic packaging has now become a new raw material. Three different methods are available for recycling and recovering this packaging: Mechanical recycling, feedstock recycling and energy recovery. In compliance with the provisions of the German Packaging Ordinance, however, plastic packagiong collected by the Dual System may only be reycled using mechanical or feedstock techniques. In the recent past, the environmental impacts caused by the individual techniques have attracted much more attention, leading to controversial discussions in some cases. This study showes that the ecological significance is not, as is often falsely assumed, dependent on whether post-consumer plastics are recycled into their starting products. On the contrary, the efficiency with which primary resources are replaced with post-consumer plastics is of primary importance. The suitability of mechanical recycling, feedstock recycling and energy recovery techniques for this purpose naturally differs depending on the initial situation. Therefore it is impossible to make a global statement such as: Mechanical recycling is better than feedstock recycling...|$|E
40|$|The {{work of the}} DKR is {{a clearly}} defined task set by legislation. The company {{implements}} {{the requirements of the}} German Packaging Ordinance and, in this way, enables the plastics industry to accept responsibility for its products, as specified in the Recycling and Waste Management Act. Each year, the DKR forwards around 600, 000 tonnes of plastic <b>sales</b> <b>packaging</b> for recycling, thus exceeding the recycling targets set by German legislation. With the in-depth processing and recycling audit and consistent quality management, the company has created effective control instruments for plastics recycling. The logistics system with its modern data technology ensures that the material streams are rigorously controlled and, last but not least, the comprehensive mass flow verification documents that the plastic packaging has been recycled properly. In addition to providing services that ensure reliable recycling, the goal of eco-efficient plastics recycling is steadily becoming more important. Decreasing costs and ecological benefits are the standards used to measure plastics recycling today. The DKR therefore promotes competition in order to find the most efficient recycling concepts and supports the opening up of new markets for recycled products. (orig.)

40|$|The German “Dual System” – the {{packaging}} industry's private association for recycling <b>sales</b> <b>packaging</b> - {{has been in}} existence for around 15 years. The “Dual System” {{is considered to be}} a prime example of “regulated self-regulation”, a concept in which the state uses the threat of regulatory guidelines as a means to force the private sector to find their own solutions to problems. However, in the case of the “Dual System”, this threat is not a strong one: carrying it out would render the politically defined recycling goals unachievable. As the “Dual System” obviously functions anyway, “regulated self-regulation” is an inadequate theoretical concept for explaining the “Dual System”. It needs to be replaced by an interpretation which accentuates the efficiency of autonomous private organisation. This interpretation is provided by the theory of social systems. Das “Duale System” – ein Zusammenschluss der Verpackungsindustrie zur Verwertung von Verkaufsverpackungen – existiert in Deutschland seit 15 Jahren. Es gilt der Theorie vom “Gewährleistungsstaat” als Musterbeispiel der “regulierten Selbstregulierung”. Danach wird private Selbstorganisation durch staatliche Drohung mit ordnungsrechtlichen Pflichten erzwungen. Die Drohung mit dem Ordnungsrecht ist im Falle des “Dualen Systems” aber leer: Würde sie umgesetzt, könnten die politisch definierten Verwertungsziele nicht erreicht werden. Weil das “Duale System” aber dennoch funktioniert, ist das theoretische Konzept der “regulierten Selbstregulierung” für das “Duale System” inadäquat. Es muss durch ein Deutungsmodell ersetzt werden, das die Funktionsfähigkeit autonomer privater Selbstorganisation akzentuiert. Dieses Modell liefert die Systemtheorie...|$|E
40|$|Against the {{backdrop}} of advancing prices for blast furnace coke and primary energy carriers based on fossil fuels the ironmaking industry tries to utilize secondary raw materials to the maximum feasible extent. In Germany among others plastic granulate material produced from recycled <b>sales</b> <b>packaging</b> that arises from the “Green Dot” system, {{is used as a}} substitute reducing agent and energy source. Up to particle sizes of 10 mm the material can be injected into the blast furnace via the tuyères by using a pneumatic conveying system and by means of several injection lances. Although the physical and chemical parameters of the applied recycling products are specified in principle there can be deviations resulting from inefficient material processing. Particularly with regard to particle size individual lots can contain a higher amount of fine and fibrous particles that build up fluff agglomerates when being agitated as it is the case during pneumatic conveying and injection, in consequence of which the pipes and filters of the system are choked. The occurrence of fluff therefore requires additional treatment of the material. At the Institute of Mechanical Process Engineering & Solids Processing of the Technical University of Berlin the dry separation of the fluff material fraction has been systematically investigated in the framework of a cooperation project with ironmaking industry. The paper presents results from bench scale tests using a laboratory zigzag sifter. The analysis of separation efficiency with respect to finding the optimal process parameters in terms of volumetric air flow rate and solids throughput comprised the evaluation of material recovery and grade efficiency curves. Based on the results a process for industrial application can be designed. ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: In {{the light}} of {{anthropogenic}} resource depletion and the resulting influences on the greenhouse effect as well as globally occurring famine, food waste has garnered increased public interest in recent years. The {{aim of this study}} is to analyze the environmental impacts of food waste and to determine to what extent consumers' behavior influences the environmental burden of food consumption in households. Methods: A life cycle assessment (LCA) study of three food products is conducted, following the ISO 14040 / 44 life cycle assessment guidelines. This study addresses the impact categories climate change (GWP 100), eutrophication (EP), and acidification (AP). Primary energy demand (PED) is also calculated. For adequate representation of consumer behavior, scenarios based on various consumer types are generated in the customer stage. The customer stage includes the food-related activities: shopping, storage, preparation, and disposal of food products as well as the disposal of the <b>sales</b> <b>packaging.</b> Results and discussion: If the consumer acts careless towards the environment, the customer stage appears as the main hotspot in the LCA of food products. The environmental impact of food products can be reduced in the customer stage by an environmentally conscious consumer. Shopping has the highest effect on the evaluated impact categories and the PED. Additionally, consumers can reduce the resulting emissions by decreasing the electric energy demand, particularly concerning food storage or preparation. Moreover, results show that the avoidance of wasting unconsumed food can reduce the environmental impact significantly. Conclusions: Results of this study show that the influence of consumer behavior on the LCA results is important. The customer stage of food products should not be overlooked in LCA studies. To enable comparison among results of other LCA studies, the LCA community needs to develop a common methodology for modeling consumer behavior...|$|E
