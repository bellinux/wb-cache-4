40|$|Electron-beam-induced {{deposition}} (EBID) is {{a versatile}} micro- and nanofabrication technique based on electron-induced dissociation of metal-carrying gas molecules adsorbed on a target. EBID {{has the advantage}} of direct deposition of three-dimensional structures on almost any target geometry. This technique has occasionally been used in focused electron-beam instruments, such as scanning electron microscopes, scanning transmission electron microscopes (<b>STEM),</b> or lithography <b>machines.</b> Experiments showed that the EBID spatial resolution, defined as the lateral size of a singular deposited dot or line, always exceeds the diameter of the electron beam. Until recently, no one has been able to fabricate EBID features smaller than 15 – 20 ?nm diameter, even if a 2 -nm-diam electron-beam writer was used. Because of this, the prediction of EBID resolution is an intriguing problem. In this article, a procedure to theoretically estimate the EBID resolution for a given energetic electron beam, target, and gaseous precursor is described. This procedure offers the most complete approach to the EBID spatial resolution problem. An EBID model was developed based on electron interactions with the solid target and with the gaseous precursor. The spatial resolution of EBID can be influenced by many factors, of which two are quantified: the secondary electrons, suspected by almost all authors working in this field, and the delocalization of inelastic electron scattering, a poorly known effect. The results confirm the major influence played by the secondary electrons on the EBID resolution and show that the role of the delocalization of inelastic electron scattering is negligible. The model predicts that a 0. 2 -nm electron beam can deposit structures with minimum sizes between 0. 2 and 2 ?nm, instead of the formerly assumed limit of 15 – 20 ?nm.

40|$|Mechanical {{loosening}} is {{a common}} mode of joint replacement failure. For cemented implants, loosening at the implant-cement interface may be affected by stem surface design. Altering the surface topography facilitates the infiltration of bone cement onto the stem, creating a mechanical interlock, improving interface stability. However, few in-vitro studies have investigated this. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} thesis was to investigate the effect of stem surface treatments and substrate materials on stem-cement interface stability in-vitro. Four separate studies were performed to assess the stability of various stem surface treatments, with two substrate materials, under three loading modes. Titanium and cobalt chrome implant <b>stems</b> were custom <b>machined</b> and treated with one of four surfaces: smooth, sintered beads, plasma spray, and circumferential grooves. Sintered bead and plasma sprayed stems were tested in independent torsion, compression and bending; circumferential groove designs were compared in torsion and then compression. All stems were potted in aluminum tubes using PMMA, and loaded cyclically using a materials testing machine. A custom optical tracking system (resolution under 5 μm) was validated for use, and subsequently employed to measure stem-cement interface motion during loading. Overall, results showed surface treatments improved stability, but this was affected by substrate material. Across all loading modes, beaded treatments applied to titanium stems, and plasma spray treatments applied to cobalt chrome stems, improved interface stability and strength when large surface treatment areas were employed. Additionally, the machining of circumferential grooves onto the stem surface improved interface strength in compression, with no influence in torsion. A final study was performed using μ-CT imaging to observe stem and cement motion under bending loads. A custom-built loading device applied static loads to smooth titanium stems, while acquiring CT images of the stem-cement interface. Interface motion was quantified by comparing scans before and after the stem underwent cyclic loading. Results indicated the stem and the surrounding cement had displaced following loading, yet the stems remained relatively stable. These studies offer valuable information regarding the effect of stem surface treatments on stem-cement interface mechanics under various loading modes and will be used in the development of future implant systems...|$|R
40|$|Ankara : Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Graduate School of Engineering and Science of Bilkent University, 2011. Thesis (Master's) [...] Bilkent University, 2011. Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 83 - 92 There is {{a growing}} demand for highly accurate micro-scale parts from various industries including medical, biotechnology, energy, consumer, and aerospace. Mechanical micro-machining which is capable of fabricating three dimensional micro-scale features {{on a wide range}} of engineering materials such as metals, polymers, ceramics and composites is a viable micro-manufacturing technique to effectively address this demand. Miniature machine tools (MMTs) are developed and used in mechanical micro-machining since their small size improves the accuracy and efficiency of the process. The output quality of the final product manufactured on an MMT depends on choosing the optimum machining parameters. However, the full potential of micro-machining can not be achieved due to challenges that reduce the repeatability of the process. One of the most significant challenges in micro-machining is the deterioration of output quality due to the MMT vibrations. This thesis demonstrates the development of a threeaxis miniature machine tool, the performance evaluation of its micro-scale milling process, and the characterization of its dynamic behaviour using finite element simulations and experiments. The MMT is designed and constructed using precision three-axis positioning slides (2 micrometers positioning accuracy, 10 nanometers positioning resolution, 60 mm x 60 mm x 60 mm workspace), miniature ultra-high speed spindles (ceramic bearing electrical spindle with maximum 50, 000 rpm rotational speed and air bearing air turbine spindle with maximum 160, 000 rpm rotational speed), a miniature force dynamometer, and a microscope. Three dimensional finite element simulations are performed on the developed MMT to obtain the static and dynamic characteristics of the spindle side. A maximum static deflection of 0. 256 µm is obtained on the designed base when 20 N forces in three directions are applied to the center of the spindle. Dynamic finite element analysis predicts the first three natural frequencies as 700 Hz, 828 Hz and 1896 Hz; hence corresponding spindle speeds should be avoided for successful application of micro-machining. To demonstrate the capability of MMT for manufacturing three dimensional (3 D) features, micro-milling is proposed as a novel method for fabricating Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) polymer micro-needles. The micro-machinability of PMMA and PLGA polymers is investigated experimentally by machining a group of 3 mm length and 100 µm depth slots using 50, 000 and 100, 000 rpm spindle speeds with different feedrates (5, 10, 15, and 20 µm/flute). The micro-machinability study concludes that PLGA has better machinability than PMMA. It is also observed that the machining parameters of 50, 000 rpm spindle speed and 20 µm/flute feedrate give better output quality. Using these machining parameters, micro needles with different geometries are successfully manufactured from PMMA and PLGA polymers. During this study, it is observed that polymer pillars bend due to machining forces and vibrations, which causes dimensional errors. To address the deterioration of the output quality due to vibrations <b>stemming</b> from <b>machining</b> forces and high-speed-rotations, MMT vibrations particularly focusing on the spindle side dynamics are investigated experimentally using runout (spindle axis offset) measurements and experimental modal analysis techniques. The results are compared with those from three-dimensional finite element simulations. The investigation of MMT vibrations indicates that the developed MMT is convenient for accurate applications of micro-machining using air-turbine air bearing spindle. However, the selection of the operation frequencies for electrical spindle is challenging at certain speeds with this design because most of the critical natural frequencies of the developed MMT appear in the operating frequency range of electrical spindle. Runout measurements using two laser doppler vibrometer (LDV) systems and experimental modal analyis which utilizes an impact hammer and accelerometer are conducted to obtain spindle side dynamics. Runout measurements performed on the miniature ultra-high speed ceramic bearing electrical spindle show that both magnitude and shape of the runout errors vary considerably with spindle speed. A peak of 1. 62 µm synchronous runout is observed at 15, 000 rpm. Asynchronous runout errors become significant between spindle speeds of 40, 000 and 50, 000 rpm and reach to a maximum of 0. 21 µm at 45, 000 rpm. On the other hand, experimental modal analysis is conducted to obtain both the steady-state and speed dependent frequency response functions (FRFs) of the mechanical structures. Steady state FRFs indicate that 750 Hz and 850 Hz are two important natural frequencies for successful application of micro-machining. Compared to the three dimensional finite element simulations, there is 7...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the growing}} world population, the {{agricultural}} sector needs more productive and more energy-efficient agricultural machinery in order to adequately address the growing demand for food and biomass. Therefore, the sector significantly invests in the optimization of agricultural machinery. Historically, the optimization of agricultural machinery was done by trial and error. Design improvements of agricultural machinery are still often based on the experience and the insights of engineers and farmers. To test whether an adjustment has a positive effect, a prototype is developed and validated during field tests. This optimization method, however, has some disadvantages. Developing and constructing a prototype is costly. Moreover, prototypes can only be validated in field conditions during the growing season. These two factors oblige agricultural machinery manufacturers to opt for small adaptations with a high success rate. The current generation of agricultural machinery is, therefore, the result of decades of evolution. Now that computing power increases, another opportunity to improve the design of agricultural machinery presents itself. Models and simulations facilitate the optimization of machines. However, an accurate virtual crop model is missing. A simulation model that accurately describes the interactions between individual crop stems and the interactions between crop <b>stems</b> and <b>machine</b> components {{could be used to}} improve the design of stem processing agricultural machinery. In this thesis, such a simulation model was developed for the processing of crop stems in a baler. It has previously been shown that the Discrete Element Method (DEM) can be used to simulate and optimize particulate processes. For this, two requirements need to be met. Realistic particle geometries and realistic deformation models are required to obtain accurate simulation results. The virtual crop stems, therefore, need to be compressible and bendable. Also the frictional and tensional properties need to be realistic. A first step {{in the development of the}} DEM simulation model included an analysis of the bending behaviour of crop stems. It was observed that there are two phases during bending: ovalisation and buckling. The forces that occur during ovalisation result in a flattening of the cross-section of the stem and this reduces the bending resistance. This process continues until the maximum force has been reached and the stem buckles. Buckling is associated with a strong reduction of the resistance to bending. The influence of the stem diameter, the thickness of the stem wall and the presence of a core-rind structure were examined for wheat and barley stems. All were found to affect the bending behaviour significantly. The acquired knowledge was used to develop a data based bending model for flexible particles (i. e. crop stems) in DEM. The influences of the stem length, the support distance and the number of segments which make up the virtual stem, were examined. The same data based method was also used for developing a compression model for virtual stems in DEM. For this purpose, the interactions between individual stems and the interaction between a stem and a plate were studied and modelled. The models were successfully validated by comparing bulk compression simulations and measurements. For this purpose 250 stems were compressed in a box by the movement of a plunger. To study the influence of friction on the processing of stems, measurements were performed on the stem level. The measured coefficients of friction were significantly lower than those found in the literature, which have been measured on a bulk level. The influence of friction on bulk compression was evaluated and it was found that a small change in the coefficient of friction at stem level has a significant effect on the bulk behaviour. The last stem parameter that was studied was the tensional stiffness. Stem measurements were again performed for this purpose. The force was found to increase linearly with increasing deformation up to the point where the stem broke. A linear tensional model was therefore implemented in DEM. Afterwards, the influence of the tensional resistance on the bulk deformation behaviour was examined. The effects of the tensional model parameters were found to be very limited. Therefore, the model parameters of the tensional model were selected in such a way that the computation time was minimized. The effect of strain rate on the force-deformation behaviour at the stem level was studied using a pendulum device. However, no significant effects could be observed for the tests at low and high speed with the used set-up. When the stem properties were measured and after they were modelled in DEM, the influence of the stem variability (e. g. the variability in physical and mechanical properties) on the bulk deformation behaviour was determined. To this end, simulations were performed with different degrees of variability. As a validation, bulk compression tests were performed. It was observed that a limited number of stem measurements can be sufficient to obtain accurate DEM simulations. As more stems are measured and as the stem database becomes larger, the accuracy of the simulations increases. However, the accuracy gained by measuring additional stems decreases with an increasing crop database. A statistical method was therefore presented to determine the minimum number of stem measurements needed to obtain accurate DEM simulations. When the behaviour of crop stems was fully characterized and modelled and after insights were obtained on the influence of stem variability, DEM simulations were performed regarding the processing of crop stems by the rotor of a large square baler. First, a method was developed to create virtual swaths. Scalability was demonstrated with these swaths. This reduced the computation time of thesimulations. Again, friction was found to have a significant impact on the crop processing as a higher coefficient of friction led to a higher energy consumption. When stems are damaged, less energy is required for their processing. Also, the feed rate was found to have an influence. The energy demand increased as more stems were processed simultaneously. Finally, the shape of the swath was also found to have a major impact on the required torque. An evenly filled swath was found to require less processing energy than an unevenly filled swath. In a final step, the filling of the pre-compression chamber was also simulated and successfully validated with stationary measurements. An increasing swath mass, the presence of the trip sensors (determining when the the pre-compression chamber is full) and a reduced rotor speed were found to have a negative impact on the required energy. The crop flow in the simulations was visually compared to the crop flow in the measurements. A high-speed camera was used for this purpose. The crop flows were found to be similar. However, a quantitative analysis should be performed to confirm this. The simulation model is now ready for the optimization of the design of the pick-up and feeding sections of the agricultural baler. The knowledge that was gained in this dissertation is more broadly applicable and could, for example, also be used for optimizing sections of the combine and the forage harvester. However, more research is required to accurately simulate nodes, leafs and ears. The influence of the strain rate and the number of stem measurements required to obtain accurate DEM simulations of crops should also be studied in more detail. Modelling the cutting and breaking of stems would have a positive effect on the accuracy and the applicability of the simulations. Since in many processes air currents have a major impact, a coupling with a CFD software is also necessary. nrpages: 184 status: publishe...|$|R
