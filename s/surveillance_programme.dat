25|$|The Bongo <b>Surveillance</b> <b>Programme,</b> working {{alongside}} the Kenya Wildlife Service, have recorded photos of bongos at remote salt licks in the Aberdare Forests using camera traps, and, by analyzing DNA extracted from dung, have confirmed {{the presence of}} bongo in Mount Kenya, Eburru and Mau forests. The programme estimate as few as 140 animals left in the wild – spread across four isolated populations. Whilst captive breeding programmes {{can be viewed as}} having been successful in ensuring survival of this species in Europe and North America, the situation in the wild has been less promising. Evidence exists of bongo surviving in Kenya. However, these populations are believed to be small, fragmented, and vulnerable to extinction.|$|E
500|$|West Nile virus, a flavivirus, [...] {{was first}} {{identified}} in 1937 {{when it was}} found in the blood of a feverish woman. The virus, which is carried by mosquitoes and birds, caused outbreaks of infection in North Africa and the Middle East in the 1950s and by the 1960s horses in Europe [...] fell victim. The largest outbreak in humans occurred in 1974 in Cape Province, South Africa and 10,000 people became ill. An increasing frequency of epidemics and epizootics (in horses) began in 1996, around the Mediterranean basin, and by 1999 the virus had reached New York City. Since then the virus has spread throughout the US. In the US, mosquitoes carry the highest amounts of virus in late summer, and the number of cases of the disease increases in mid July to early September. When the weather becomes colder, the mosquitoes die and the risk of disease decreases. In Europe, many outbreaks have occurred; [...] in 2000 a <b>surveillance</b> <b>programme</b> began in the UK to monitor the incidence of the virus in humans, dead birds, mosquitoes and horses. The mosquito (Culex modestus) that can carry the virus breeds on the marshes of north Kent. This mosquito species was not previously thought to be present in the UK, but it is widespread in southern Europe where it carries West Nile virus.|$|E

40|$|Consequences of {{classical}} swine fever (CSF) epidemics depend on the control measures, {{but also on the}} number of infected herds {{at the end of the}} high-risk period (HRP). <b>Surveillance</b> <b>programmes</b> aim to keep this number as low as possible, so the effectiveness of <b>surveillance</b> <b>programmes</b> can be measured by the number of infected herds at the end of the HRP. In this paper, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the following five Dutch CSF <b>surveillance</b> <b>programmes</b> is presented: (1) routine gross pathology of severely diseased pigs; (2) routine virological tests of tonsils of all pigs, submitted under 1; (3) daily clinical observation by the farmer; (4) periodic clinical inspection by a veterinarian; (5) leucocyte counts in blood samples from diseased animals on a herd where antimicrobial 'group therapy' is started. The evaluation was done by a modelling study, in which virus transmission, disease development, and actions and diagnostic tests in <b>surveillance</b> <b>programmes</b> were simulated. Also, the yearly costs of the programmes were calculated, and direct costs of CSF epidemics were related to the number of infected herds at the end of the HRP. It appeared that the current Dutch <b>surveillance</b> <b>programmes,</b> without the leucocyte counts, keep the number of infected herds at the end of the HRP below 20 with 95 % probability. Leaving out the most-expensive programme of periodic inspection (12. 5 M¿ per year) does not change this result - indicating that (for CSF <b>surveillance)</b> the <b>programme</b> could well be stopped. If the leucocyte programme, which is currently not effective due to the low sample submission rate, optimally were applied, the 95 th percentile could be reduced to 10 infected herds. However, whether application is beneficial is unclear, because of uncertainty of the economic benefits due to the many expected false-positive herds each year...|$|R

METHODRepresentatives from 38 CP <b>surveillance</b> <b>programmes</b> {{were invited to participate}} in an online survey and submit their data collection forms. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize information submitted. RESULTSTwenty-seven <b>surveillance</b> <b>programmes</b> participated (25 functioning registers, two closed owing to lack of funding). Their aims spanned five domains: resource for CP research, surveillance, aetiology/prevention, service planning, and information provision (in descending order of frequency). Published definitions guided decision making for the definition of CP and case eligibility for most programmes. Consent, case identification, and data collection methods varied widely. Ten key data items were collected by all programmes and a further seven by at least 80 % of programmes. All programmes reported an interest in research collaboration. INTERPRETATIONDespite variability in methodologies, similarities exist across programmes in terms of their aims, definitions, and data collected. These findings will facilitate harmonization of data and collaborative research efforts, which are so necessary on account of the heterogeneity and relatively low prevalence of CP.

Diagnosis and treatment of helminthiasis, especially with low worm load is an unmet public health need in such settings. The infection may sometimes become manifest when a second pathology leads to purgation of the gastrointestinal tract. Two cases of helminthiasis are presented in which the infections only became amenable to diagnosis due to acute diarrhoea caused by giardiasis and lactulose administration. In the first case, acute giardiasis revealed Ascaris lumbricoides infestation, {{and in the second}} case primary helminthiasis (strongyloidiasis) was revealed by lactulose, and also led to Vibrio cholera bacteremia.
