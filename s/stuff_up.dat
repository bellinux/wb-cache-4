500|$|Jackson’s initial {{role was}} to provide score for Trevor’s missions, and he took {{influence}} from artists such as The Mars Volta and Queens of the Stone Age. When he learnt that the team would be building off each other’s work, he voiced concern that the finished product could be disjointed. After sharing his work with the team, he was particularly impressed by Froese's contributions. [...] "Edgar evolved the music, made it into a whole other thing", Jackson said. Froese had interpolated funk sounds with Jackson’s hip-hop influences. Froese and Jackson then sent their work between The Alchemist and Oh No, who heavily sampled it. The Alchemist opined, [...] "We were sampling, taking a piece form here, a piece from there...We pitched <b>stuff</b> <b>up,</b> chopped it, tweaked it. Then we chose the tracks that worked and everyone came in and layered on that". DJ Shadow then mixed the team's creations together and matched it to the gameplay. Pavlovich considered [...] "how to make the hip-hop and rock score not sound like they were instrumentals of songs on the radio, but rather something unique to the score" [...] a challenge.|$|E
500|$|Flight Unlimited {{was placed}} in direct {{competition}} with several major flight simulator franchises. Before the game's release, Shelby Bateman of Next Generation Magazine wrote, [...] "1995 {{is going to be}} a real dogfight in the flight-sim and aerial-combat categories, and LookingGlass [...] is betting its bankroll ... that it can capture significant market share from the likes of Microsoft Flight Simulator and the debut of Spectrum HoloByte's Falcon 4.0, among others." [...] Describing the situation, Johnny L. Wilson of Computer Gaming World wrote, [...] "The games that sell big are the ones that allow you to blow <b>stuff</b> <b>up,</b> so, if anything, that could be a problem for Flight Unlimited." [...] Doug Church explained that, because the game did not feature combat and bore little resemblance to Microsoft Flight Simulator, the team spent [...] "many late nights" [...] on marketing strategies. However, he noted that the game had a wide appeal among those who tested it during development, which he called [...] "a really good sign". Talking to Bernie Yee of PC Gamer US, Paul Neurath said that he thought the game would sell well. Yee noted that Neurath [...] "fully [...] it to prove more popular than Microsoft Flight Simulator".|$|E
500|$|For the {{majority}} of the recordings, Saadiq played most of the instruments, including bass, keyboard, guitar, Mellotron, percussion, and drums, and he also layered each recorded instrumental part afterwards. Brungardt used a Neumann U 47 microphone to record each of Saadiq's instrument parts. Saadiq recorded his vocals on a dynamic microphone alone in the recording studio's control room, an approach encouraged to him earlier in his career by record producer and audio engineer Gerry Brown. According to Brungardt, [...] " [...] voice benefits from a dynamic mic because it tends to give him more bottom and presence. Plus dynamic mics can sound a little older when pushed". With the songs' guitar parts, Brungardt wanted to create additional distortion in order to produce a grittier guitar sound for the songs, a stylistic preference Saadiq and he had acquired from listening to a great deal of indie rock at the time. He applied several techniques to achieve this sound, including increasing the gain on Saadiq's Fender Twin guitar amplifier, using a software plug-in for the recordings in post-production, and re-amping Saadiq's guitar parts. In his interview for EQ Magazine, Brungardt discussed using a Massey TapeHead, one of his preferred plug-ins, in the recording process, stating [...] "I’ll use that {{on a lot of things}} to get a little more grit. It thickens <b>stuff</b> <b>up</b> nicely if you record something that’s a little too bright. I usually go a lot for darker tones when recording and mixing".|$|E

500|$|Beginning {{with the}} periodical's 30th issue in 1979, Greenwood {{published}} {{a series of}} short articles that detailed the setting in The Dragon magazine, {{the first of which}} was about a monster known as the curst. Greenwood wrote voluminous entries to Dragon magazine, using the Realms as a setting for his descriptions of magic items, monsters, and spells. In 1986, the American game publishing company TSR began looking for a new campaign setting for the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game, and assigned Jeff Grubb {{to find out more about}} the setting used by Greenwood as portrayed in his articles in Dragon. According to Greenwood, Grubb asked him [...] "Do you just make this <b>stuff</b> <b>up</b> as you go, or do you really have a huge campaign world?"; Greenwood answered [...] "yes" [...] to both questions. TSR felt that the Forgotten Realms would be a more open-ended setting than the epic Dragonlance setting, and chose the Realms as a ready-made campaign setting upon deciding to publish AD 2nd Edition. Greenwood agreed to work on the project, and began working to get the Forgotten Realms officially published. Greenwood sent TSR a few dozen cardboard boxes stuffed with pencil notes and maps, and sold all rights to the Realms for a token fee. Greenwood noted that TSR altered his original conception of the Realms being a place that we could travel to from our world, [...] "Concerns over possible lawsuits (kids getting hurt while trying to 'find a gate') led TSR to de-emphasize this meaning".|$|E
500|$|In December 2009, {{director}} Joe Johnston {{indicated that}} he planned to start filming in April 2010. In a separate interview that month, he described the film's pre-production: [...] "Rick Heinrichs is production-designing and we're set up down in Manhattan Beach, California.... We have eight or ten really talented artists, and we all just sit around all day and draw pictures and say, 'Hey, wouldn't it be cool if we could do this?' It's that phase of the production where money doesn't matter: 'Let's put all the greatest <b>stuff</b> <b>up</b> on the wall and [...] see what we can afford. The film, he said, will begin [...] "in 1942, 1943" [...] during World War II. [...] "The stuff in the '60s and '70s [...] we're sort of avoiding. We're going back to the '40s, and then forward to what they're doing with Captain America now." [...] In February 2010, Johnston stated that the Invaders will appear in [...] "the entire second half" [...] of the film, leading fans to speculate this was the World War II-era Marvel superhero team of that name, and in November Johnston refuted speculation that the Sub-Mariner, an Invaders team-member in the comics, would be included. Johnston later explained that [...] "the Invaders" [...] had been discussed simply as a possible name for the squad of commandos Captain America leads in the film. Christopher Markus, one of the screenwriters, said the unnamed group was [...] "called the Howling Commandos in the script, but no one says that out loud." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{this period}} quarterback Charlie Conerly emerged. Conerly was the team's {{starting}} quarterback from 1948 to 1960, {{and had a}} franchise-record string of 12 consecutive seasons in which he led the team in passing. A former US Marine, Conerly was renowned among his teammates for his toughness. [...] "There was a time my rookie year when I really saw it", recalled running back Frank Gifford. [...] "He broke his nose really badly, they literally called a timeout and then they called another one while they stopped the bleeding, they stuck <b>stuff</b> <b>up</b> there until it would stop bleeding. You {{try to get them}} to do that today. They'd be yelling, 'Get my agent!'". In 1951, the Giants finished 9–2–1, but their inability to beat division rival Cleveland cost them an opportunity to play in the Championship Game. Fullback Eddie Price led the league in rushing and set a league record for rushing attempts in a season, and defensive linemen Arnie Weinmeister and Al Derogatis, linebacker Jon Baker, and offensive tackle Tex Coulter all made the All-Pro team. The following year New York fell to 7–5, but Tunnell continued to impress. [...] "Tunnell returned interceptions, punts, and kickoffs with such electric flair that he actually outgained the league rushing leader in yards gained" [...] according to one publication. Tunnell amassed 924yards, while never lining up on offense, whereas the league rushing leader totalled 894. The Giants offense struggled in 1953, and they fell to a 3–9 record. Gifford was forced to play both ways due to a depleted roster, and in the second to last game of the season they lost 62–14 to division rival Cleveland.|$|E

But apart from that problem {{of not being able to}} match the soundtrack, I {{thought it was}} a wonderful show. Unfortunately it caused a lot of havoc, because the guy who took over as head of drama in Sydney had been an ex-sound recordist, and he regarded it as beneath his golden standard, so he was very willing to sabotage it. And it was a great excuse for the Sydney mob to say you <b>stuffed</b> <b>up</b> down there ...|$|R

2500|$|On November 30, 2003, Zuckerberg told Cameron Winklevoss in {{an email}} {{that he did}} not expect {{completion}} of the project to be difficult. Zuckerberg writes: [...] "I read over all the stuff you sent and it seems like it shouldn't take too long to implement, so we can talk about that after I get all the basic functionality up tomorrow night." [...] The next day, on December 1, 2003, Zuckerberg sent another email to the HarvardConnection team. [...] "I put together one of the two registration pages so I have everything working on my system now. I'll keep you posted as I patch <b>stuff</b> <b>up</b> and it starts to become completely functional." [...] On December 4, 2003, Zuckerberg writes: [...] "Sorry I was unreachable tonight. I just got about three of your missed calls. I was working on a problem set." [...] On December 10, 2003: [...] "The week has been pretty busy thus far, so I haven't gotten a chance to do much work on the site or even think about it really, so I think it's probably best to postpone meeting until we have more to discuss. I'm also really busy tomorrow so I don't think I'd be able to meet then anyway." [...] A week later: [...] "Sorry I have not been reachable for the past few days. I've basically been in the lab the whole time working on a cs problem set which I'm still not finished with." [...] On December 17, 2003, Zuckerberg met with the Winklevosses and Narendra in his dorm room, allegedly confirming his interest and assuring them that the site was almost complete. On the whiteboard in his room, Zuckerberg allegedly had scrawled multiple lines of code under the heading “Harvard Connection,” however, this would be the only time they saw any of his work. On January 8, 2004, Zuckerberg emailed to say he was [...] "completely swamped with work [...] week" [...] but had [...] "made some of the changes ... and they seem to be working great" [...] on his computer. He said he could discuss the site starting the following Tuesday, on January 13, 2004. On January 11, 2004, Zuckerberg registered the domain name thefacebook.com. On January 12, 2004, Zuckerberg e-mailed Eduardo Saverin, saying that the Facebook site [...] was almost complete and that they should discuss marketing strategies. Two days later, on January 14, 2004, Zuckerberg met again with the HarvardConnection team; however, he allegedly failed to disclose registering the domain name thefacebook.com or developing a competing social networking website. Rather, he allegedly reported progress on HarvardConnection, told the team he would continue to work on it, and would email the group later in the week. On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched thefacebook.com, a social network for Harvard students, designed to expand to other schools around the country.|$|E
