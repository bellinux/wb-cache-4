50|$|Research {{commissioned}} by the Beyond 2011 programme identified there were risks associated with over reliance on administrative data drawn from governmental department sources due to process changes, such as benefits and welfare payments and the necessity to include full access to statistical data as part as proposed legislation affecting administrative programmes. Issues identified also included the accuracy of administrative data sets for geographical areas below that of local authorities, problems associated with estimation {{and the use of}} address registers. ONS on behalf of the UK Statistics Authority has taken on board the recommendations of the <b>Skinner</b> <b>Report</b> into methodology work and has proposed three research strands to determine the 'optimum blend' of online census, administrative data and surveying methods for the 2021 census and indeed subsequent censuses.|$|E
50|$|Mr Farley {{bought a}} large estate - Riverside House - in Blackboys, Sussex, {{not far from}} Gatwick. It had a croquet lawn, a tennis court, an orchard, a paddock and a {{swimming}} pool. It cost £420,000 and after the purchase was complete on 28 February 1991, he spent £125,000 improving it. He also had a flat in London, a house in Brighton and one overseas. He hired Mr Skinner to survey the house, particularly to determine levels of aircraft noise. <b>Skinner</b> <b>reported</b> that the noise was of acceptable level, whereas in reality, at 6 am the noise was intolerable. Holding patterns formed right above the house. This distressed Mr Farley as he often spent early mornings in his garden.|$|R

50|$|According to {{a report}} in the Daily Mirror, he had been a {{significant}} local drug dealer in Bedford, known on the street as <b>Skinner.</b> The <b>report</b> stated that he became increasingly radicalised in prison, mixing with extremist Islamists, and promising to sell drugs to aid their cause.|$|R
500|$|Historian and {{political}} philosopher Quentin Skinner {{points out that}} Otto of Freising (c. 1114–1158), a German bishop visiting north Italy during the 12th century, noticed a widespread new form {{of political and social}} organization, observing that Italy appeared to have exited from Feudalism so that its society was based on merchants and commerce. Linked to this was anti-monarchical thinking, represented in the famous early Renaissance fresco cycle Allegory of Good and Bad Government in Siena by Ambrogio Lorenzetti (painted 1338–1340), whose strong message is about the virtues of fairness, justice, republicanism and good administration. Holding both Church and Empire at bay, these city republics were devoted to notions of liberty. <b>Skinner</b> <b>reports</b> that there were many defences of liberty such as the Matteo Palmieri (1406–1475) celebration of Florentine genius not only in art, sculpture and architecture, but [...] "the remarkable efflorescence of moral, social {{and political}} philosophy that occurred in Florence at the same time".|$|R
5000|$|In an {{anonymous}} case <b>reported</b> in <b>Skinner's</b> <b>Reports,</b> 404, in 1693, Lord Chief Justice John Holt {{said that the}} privilege would extend to a law scrivener, because he would be counsel to a man with whom he would advise. But he {{is reported to have}} added [...] "otherwise of a Gentleman, Parson etc." [...] Badeley maintains that Lord Holt did not mean this last assertion to be general and exclusive. This may conceivably be so. It is recorded in another anonymous case, which we find in Lord Raymond's [...] "Reports", 733, that the same judge refused to admit the evidence of a person entrusted by both the parties to the cause to make and keep secret a bargain. He added that [...] "him a trustee should not be a witness in order to betray the trust". But the last decision cannot be said to be in agreement with the law of evidence as generally laid down.|$|R

30|$|Leverage (LEV) {{captures the}} impact of debt {{contracting}} on EM. The relationship between EM and leverage is subject to two posing empirical findings. Sweeney (1994) and Press and Weintrop (1990) suggested that high leverage firms tend engage in aggressive EM. They find that firms respond to debt contracting by reporting discretionary accruals (Becker et al. 1998; Richardson et al. 2002). In contrast, Dechow and <b>Skinner</b> (2000) <b>report</b> that firms with high leverage {{are less likely to}} report small earnings increases. Chung and Kallapur (2003) do not find a relation between abnormal accruals and leverage at all, suggesting that the relation between leverage and EM is uncertain.|$|R
40|$|ResumenSe ofrece una nota ilustrada sobre los ganchos de tiradera (o garrucha) en el contexto de la arqueología de Cuba. Skinner reportó el primer gancho de tiradera en la {{literatura}} arqueológica del Caribe en 1925. En 1977, el autor reconoció un gancho de tiradera en Indian Creek, isla de Antigua, y se empezaron a identificar estos artefactos en el resto de Las Antillas; excepto en Cuba. Una ojeada a la literatura arqueológica cubana muestra que sí se habían reportado antes, pero no se identificaron como tales. También se añaden datos sobre la eficiencia de las tiraderas o garruchas, y se esboza el inicio de una tipología de sus ganchos. Se hacen observaciones acerca de las tiraderas o garruchas en otros contextos arqueológicos del Caribe. Se mencionan los dardos usados. Las tiraderas se comparan al arco débil que usaban los taínos del oriente de Cuba. AbstractAn illustrated note {{is offered}} on the spear-thrower (or atlatl) spurs {{in the context}} of the archaeology of Cuba. <b>Skinner</b> <b>reported</b> the first spear-thrower spur in the archaeological literature of the Caribbean in 1925. In 1977, the author recognized a spear-thrower spur in Indian Creek, island of Antigua, and these artifacts began to be identified in the rest of the West Indies; except for Cuba. A look at the Cuban archaeological literature shows that they indeed had been reported before, but not identified as such. Also added are data on the efficiency of the spear-throwers or atlatl, and a beginning is made on a typology of their spurs. Ob-servations are made about the spear-throwers or atlatl in other archaeological contexts of the Caribbean. The darts used are mentioned. The spear-throwers are compared to the weak bow used by the Tainos of eastern Cuba...|$|R

These changes came under the notice and criticism of Lord George Sackville and <b>Skinner</b> wrote a <b>report</b> describing their inefficiency and arbitrariness. The two of them attended the House of Commons in 1758 where O'Hara harangued Skinner who took the anger in good humour.

30|$|Some {{selective}} {{agents have}} been previously used for selective enumeration of Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobium sp. from soils and non-sterile inoculants. Selective agents included antibiotics, heavy metals, dyes and metabolic inhibitors (Danso et al, 1973; Graham, 1969; Thompson, 1967; Van Schreven, 1970). Pattison and <b>Skinner</b> (1974) <b>reported</b> a formulation that contained pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB), brilliant green (BG), sodium azide, crystal violet, and penicillin. Gómez et al. (1995) proposed two selective media for the enumeration of B. japonicum from soybean inoculants (at that time mostly using non-sterile peat as carrier) containing tetracycline, rifampicin and chloramphenicol to control bacteria and cycloheximide and pimafucin to control fungal contaminants. In our study, most fungal contamination could be prevented by using previously reported PCNB concentrations on the YEM base medium (P-YEM). However, {{the presence of}} large mucoid colonies of some gram-positive bacilli after one week incubation prevented {{in most cases the}} differentiation and enumeration of typical rhizobium colonies. Our use of the combined PV-YEM medium allowed a significant improvement in the efficiency of on-seed rhizobial enumeration as it effectively prevented the growth of Gram-positive bacteria and fungi (Figure 1).|$|R
50|$|St. James' Church, {{also known}} as Skinner's Church, was {{commissioned}} by Skinner after he had vowed, while lying wounded in the battlefield of Uniara in 1800, to build one if he survived. It was built at his own expense and {{at a cost of}} Rs95,000. Designed by Major Robert Smith it was built between 1826-36 to a cruciform plan, with three porticoed porches and a central octagonal dome. It was consecrated on 21 November 1836 by the Right Reverend Daniel Wilson D.D. the Bishop of Calcutta, making it the oldest church in Delhi. <b>Skinner</b> is also <b>reported</b> to have built a temple and a mosque, though details of them are unknown.|$|R
5000|$|The {{controversial}} season nine episode [...] "The Principal and the Pauper" [...] heavily altered Skinner's backstory, revealing {{him as an}} impostor. Born as Armin Tamzarian in 1953, he was {{a troubled}} orphan from Capital City, who was forced into the US Army during the Vietnam War. There, {{he served as a}} Green Beret under Sgt. Seymour Skinner, whom he came to idolize and befriend. When <b>Skinner</b> was <b>reported</b> missing and presumed dead, Tamzarian returned to Springfield to inform Skinner's mother, but she deliberately mistook him for Seymour, so he assumed his identity and followed Skinner's dream of becoming a school principal. The real Seymour Skinner (voiced by Martin Sheen), had been alive after all, and briefly returned to Springfield to take his rightful place as Springfield Elementary School Principal, but had proved hopelessly unpopular and the Springfielders ran him out of town on the railroad. Judge Snyder granted Tamzarian Skinner's [...] "name, and his past, present, future, and mother", and decreed that no one will mention his true identity again [...] "under penalty of torture" [...] (although Lisa uses the real name in the episode [...] "I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot"). The episode provoked a very negative reaction both from fans and the show's staff. A clip from the episode was used in season eleven's [...] "Behind the Laughter" [...] {{as an example of the}} show's increasingly [...] "gimmicky and nonsensical plots". The continuity of the series appears to revert to the original story of Seymour Skinner in the 2010 episode [...] "Boy Meets Curl", as he is clearly shown to kick Agnes Skinner in utero, establishing him as Agnes' biological son after all.|$|R
30|$|ROS {{accumulated}} {{in response to}} various stresses are counteracted by intrinsic antioxidant systems including enzymatic scavengers like ascorbate peroxidase (APX). In plants, APX plays {{crucial role in the}} removal of H 2 O 2. In the present study, the transcript expression of the cytosolic APX gene as well as the ascorbate content induced earlier in response to 2  h cold exposure in transgenic tomato. Whereas, in wild type tomato plants, the induction in transcript expression was delayed and induced only on 24  h cold exposure. The ascorbate content analysis in wild type plant also revealed reduced ascorbate content on 2  h of cold exposure whereas on 24  h of cold exposure, the ascorbate content was similar to that of untreated control. Baek and <b>Skinner</b> (2003) have <b>reported</b> induced transcript expression of thylakoid bound APX during cold acclimation in near-isogenic lines (NILs) of wheat, differing in the Vrn 1 -Fr 1 chromosome region that conditions winter versus spring wheat growth habit. Similarly, Lin and Pu (2010) reported increased transcript accumulation of cytosolic APX in salt tolerant sweet potato cultivar than the sensitive. The earlier induction in transcript expression of APX as well as the ascorbate content in Osmotin transgenic tomato than the wild type could have resulted in better antioxidant defense, as revealed in our earlier experiments, leading to cold tolerance (Goyary 2009).|$|R
40|$|The pre-antibiotic era was characterised by {{the lack}} of {{antibiotics}} and hence, the lack of adequate means for the treatment of numerous infectious diseases. The ground-breaking discovery of penicillin and other antibiotics, which came to be widely used in clinical practice, brought great benefit and contributed to the increase of the average human life expectancy from 47 years in 1900 to 74 years (in men) and 80 years (in women) in 2000 in the USA (Lederberg 2000). Furthermore, in 1941 <b>Skinner</b> and Keefer <b>reported</b> a shocking 82 % mortality among 122 consecutive patients who had been treated for Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia before antibiotics were available (Skinner and Keefer 1941), as contrasted to 20 - 40 % mortality rates being reported in the post-antibiotic era (Mylotte, McDermott et al. 1987; Shurland, Zhan et al. 2007). The use of antimicrobials is not limited to clinical applications. Currently antimicrobials, such as, for example, chitosan based products, triclosan and various bacteriocins, are widely used in hand washing products, toothpastes and in the food industry to increase the shelf life of various products (Stephen, Saxton et al. 1990; Waaler, Rolla et al. 1993; Barkvoll and Rolla 1994; Bhargava and Leonard 1996; Gould 1996; Jones, Jampani et al. 2000; Haas, Marie et al. 2005; Galvez 2007; Dutta, Tripathi et al. 2009). By comparison to chemical disinfectants, these natural products are generally less toxic and also provide great advantages, such as biodegradability, biocompatibility as well as chemical and physical versatility (Gould 1996; Dutta, Tripathi et al. 2009). Nevertheless, the use of antibiotics for the treatment of diseases historically remains the main focus of antimicrobial research. Ever since the discovery of penicillin there have been many attempts to find novel antimicrobials due to the inevitability of development of bacterial resistance towards the widely used antibiotics. In the past years much of the effort in that direction was focused on terrestrial sources. Nowadays, more than ever before, the exploration of new and under-explored sources becomes extremely important in the process of finding biologically active compounds (“bioactives”) with novel chemical structures. The majority of antibiotics currently used in clinical practice are of natural product origin (Newman, Cragg et al. 2003; Singh and Barrett 2006; Von Nussbaum, Brands et al. 2006). For example, 70 out of the 90 antibiotics marketed in the years 1982 – 2002 originated from natural products (Newman, Cragg et al. 2003). Notably, the quinolones or fluoroqinones, {{one of the most successful}} classes of synthetic antibiotics, are also based on the structure of the natural product quinine (Demain and Sanchez 2009) (Figure 1). In fact, chemical modifications based on a natural product scaffold is a widely used approach in modifying the chemical and physical properties of the molecule, thus making it useful for a particular pharmacological application (Walters, Murcko et al. 1999; Leeson, Davis et al. 2004). It has been suggested that the success of natural compounds is due to the fact that they have undergone natural selection and, therefore, are best suited to perform their activities (Nisbet and Moore 1997; Muller-Kuhrt 2003; Koehn and Carter 2005). Thus, further research on bioactive natural products may provide a source of new chemical structures that can guide the design of novel chemical compounds (Breinbauer, Vetter et al. 2003; Nicolaou, Chen et al. 2009), as well as reveal yet unknown modes of action (Urizar, Liverman et al. 2002). 32 page(s...|$|R
