Mornings in the DeBuono {{household}} were usually hectic. Kate barely had time to dress herself between getting Natalie, her four-year old daughter, ready for school while her husband, Andrew, gets ready for work. Making breakfast and feeding Natalie was a daily struggle. Cleaning up, bagging lunches, and wrestling to get Natalie’s shoes on her feet and out to the car was always a challenge. This morning, Kate had met with Natalie’s teacher and therapists because she was concerned about her daughter’s progress. Even though Natalie’s individualized education plan (IEP) goals were written to help her improve her language and work on getting around better, Natalie still didn’t seem to interact well with other children and was fallin...|$|E

She was now tearfully regarding the meeting of Paulina with her sister Angela. The latter {{had been brought to}} the consulate by Bacri, along with her mistress and some other members of the Jew's household, and the delight of the two sisters at this unexpected meeting afforded the susceptible Zubby inexpressible--we might almost say inconceivable--joy, as was evidenced by the rising of her black cheeks, the shutting of her blacker eyes, and the display of her gorgeous teeth--front and back--as well as her red gums.|$|R

5000|$|From a press obituary: One of {{the wealthiest}} women in Great Britain, her great gifts to benevolent, educational, and {{religious}} purposes were often anonymous, and few knew what {{a large portion of}} her riches she devoted to the needs of others, particularly in South Wales, of which she was the true Lady Bountiful. During the last two years, owing to failing health, she was unable to spend much time in the Principality, but lived in quiet and retirement in London, only seeing her intimate friends. Despite her indisposition, <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> interest in war charities, providing two large Y.M.C.A. huts in Glamorgan, and converting Penrice Castleinto an officers' hospital, which she equipped and maintained at her own expense. Only recently she provided a capital sum sufficient to produce £1,500 a year for a chair of preventive medicine at the medical school in connection with Cardiff University. ... To the Church, too, she was a queenly benefactress, and her name was a household word in Wales[...] [...] [...] She combined with a benevolent spirit a rare business aptitude, and to her foresight and energy may be largely attributed the development and prosperity of Port Talbot from a small village to a thriving town possessing docks, steel works, and important railway junctions. In the welfare of the folk dependent on her <b>she</b> <b>took</b> the deepest interest, and on one occasion, an unremunerative colliery falling into her hands, she, rather than discharge the miners and close it down, kept it working for several years {{for the sake of the}} women and children, at a loss to herself of nearly £100,000. quoted in C.

She turned upward, trying to locate the direction of the new turn; but here too there was no footing. Down river she felt solid rock beneath her feet. Ah! this was the way, and boldly she stepped out, the water already above her knees. Two, three steps <b>she</b> <b>took,</b> and with each one her confidence and hope arose, and then the fourth step--and there was no footing. She felt herself lunging into the stream, and tried to draw back and regain the ledge; but the force of the current was too much for her, and, so suddenly it seemed that she had thrown herself in, she was in the channel swimming for her life.|$|R

6000|$|On Wednesday, in due course, the Reverend John Creedy {{arrived at}} the vicarage, and much curiosity there was {{throughout}} the village of Walton Magna that week to see this curious new thing, a coal-black parson. Next day, Thursday, an almost equally unusual event occurred to Ethel Berry, for, to her great surprise, she got a little note in the morning inviting her up to a tennis party at the vicarage the same afternoon. Now, though the vicar called on Aunt Emily often enough, and accepted her help readily for school feasts and other village festivities of the milder sort, the Berrys were hardly up to that level of society which is commonly invited to the parson's lawn tennis parties. And the reason why Ethel was asked on this particular Thursday must be traced to a certain pious conspiracy between the vicar {{and the secretary of}} the Gold Coast Evangelistic Society. When those two eminent missionary advocates had met a fortnight before at Exeter Hall, the secretary had represented to the vicar the desirability of young John Creedy's taking to himself an English wife before his departure. [...] "It will steady him, and keep him right on the Coast," [...] he said, [...] "and it will give him importance {{in the eyes of the}} natives as well." [...] Whereto the vicar responded that he knew exactly the right girl to suit the place in his own parish, and that by a providential conjunction <b>she</b> already <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> interest in foreign missions. So these two good men conspired in all innocence of heart to sell poor Ethel into African slavery; and the vicar had asked John Creedy down to Walton Magna on purpose to meet her.|$|R
40|$|Imagine a theater. Build {{one in your}} mind. I do {{not care}} {{if it is the}} largest theater in the {{universe}} or if it {{is the size of a}} shoebox. The theater can be an elaborate construction with gilded cherubs and priceless jewels. If you would prefer the theater to be a minimal design, imagine it that way. Maybe the theater is made out of glass or crystal. You can be all alone in the theater or maybe you are seated next to an alien, a cave man, or a robot. As the curtain rises an enormous pipe organ is spewing out J. S. Bach 2 ̆ 7 s Toccata and Fugue in D minor. The sound is colossal. The stage is designed to look like a filthy and bleak art studio. Sculptures that look like decaying flesh hang from the ceiling. Papers and dirty painting rags are scattered all over the floor. A roach crawls towards some moldy food in the wastebasket. A piece of beef jerky sits next to a pile of paint tubes and paintbrushes. Canvases are stacked against the wall. Dried paint is splattered everywhere. A woman enters stage left. As she begins to speak, the music fades. 2 ̆ 2 My most recent paintings are meant to serve as gateways between daily life and an exotic utopian fantasy. These strange psychological spaces function as portals into a new frontier inhabited with the most stupendous creatures. Active volcanoes, carnivorous plants, terrible lizards, pink Chihuahuas, flesh-eating insects, unidentified flying objects, and a host of other amazing things coexist in this cruel tropical paradise. 2 ̆ 2 Everything I do is a self-portrait and a disguise. I imagine the characters in my paintings to be mutant clones. The act of painting is like looking in the mirror. I like to spend most of my time doing one or the other. I am driven by an insatiable urge to see what I truly look like. I suffer from an unfulfilled desire to meet myself. I am frustrated with impressions and reflections. These confessions reveal my work as possibly the most disgusting display of narcissism in the entire history of art. 2 ̆ 2 The act of painting is an absurd and self-indulgent enterprise. I paint with the ridiculous and frivolous purpose of delighting the eye. Nevertheless, my hope is that my paintings capture an important aspect of my utopian fantasy with their sumptuous surroundings embellished with rainbows, natural disasters, butterflies, exotic grasses and bizarre costumes. 2 ̆ 2 My paintings can be read on many different levels from surface to deep allegory. The finished product is the result of hours upon hours of painting, pondering, and dreaming. Below the surface lies a nauseating abyss. 2 ̆ 2 My work is a delicious feast for the aesthetic consumer. I am a villainous mad scientist with a hunger for immortality. My eyes are gluttonous fools. I am a mystery and a deception. Vermillion is my opulent fetish. Lemon yellow is my nemesis. 2 ̆ 2 The music grows louder again. The woman begins to cackle. <b>She</b> then <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> breath and <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> and more dramatic bow.
