5|$|On the {{day after}} Yuichi's return, he is out with Nayuki who is showing him around city. Nayuki remembers {{that she has to}} buy things for dinner, but Yuichi is {{reluctant}} to go into the store with her. Moments after Nayuki leaves him waiting on the sidewalk, a strange girl named Ayu Tsukimiya collides with him with little warning. Upon recovering, she drags him away to a nearby café and confesses to inadvertently stealing a bag filled with taiyaki after being accidentally scared away by the salesman before she had a chance to pay. They decide to meet up again another day and Ayu scampers off. A few days after he has been in the city, Yuichi is accosted by a girl named Makoto Sawatari who has lost her memories, though <b>still</b> <b>remembers</b> that she has a grudge against him from when he last visited the city. After she collapses in the street, he takes her home and learns about her situation. Akiko gives her permission to live with them for the time being, which is against Yuichi's plan to hand her over to the police.|$|E
25|$|Mario Cuomo, Carl McCall, and Carter F. Bales {{were among}} the many people who started their careers in public service in the Lindsay administration. Rev.

Alfred Scott decided to migrate to USA on personal reasons since then and currently living in Brooklyn suburbs for 35 years.

25|$|In 1940 Proudfoot was conscripted {{into the}} Royal Air Force (RAF). After a mixed {{career in the}} RAF, Proudfoot became an NCO and served in the {{education}} branch where {{he was responsible for}} providing basic instruction in English, mathematics and technical skills to new recruits, many of whom came from an educationally disadvantaged background. As a Training Instructor he “… taught hundreds of conscripts stuff they weren’t really bothered about. He took it as a challenge to interest them and keep them entertained – an achievement he <b>still</b> <b>remembers</b> with pride” - from the Proudfoot School of Hypnosis website.|$|E
500|$|Ruby's {{credibility}} builds throughout Season 3. In [...] "Sin City", she restores {{power to}} the Colt for the Winchesters to use in their war against demons. The episode [...] "Malleus Maleficarum" [...] provides her backstory, revealing {{that she had been}} a witch during the Plague who sold her soul to a demon. She confides in Dean that, unlike other demons, she <b>still</b> <b>remembers</b> {{what it is like to}} be human, citing this trait as the reason she is helping the brothers against other demons. She returns in [...] "Jus in Bello" [...] to save the brothers from an attacking horde of demons. Upon learning that they have lost the Colt, she decides to perform a spell that will destroy all the demons in the area, including herself. However, because the spell requires a human virgin's heart, Dean does not allow her to perform it. Although the plan he comes up with instead saves himself and his brother, the people they leave behind get killed by demons pursuing Sam and Dean, which Ruby uses to rebuke the brothers for not listening to her.|$|E

2500|$|Jackson {{was well}} known in South Africa for her fast bowling, and was even advised by {{teammates}} {{that it was not}} necessary to bowl so quickly. [...] Recalling this, Jackson recounts: [...] "Shame, I <b>still</b> <b>remembers</b> how I split one of the girl's fingers open with one of my deliveries." [...] In 1960, eight days of trials were held to select a Test side to play the touring England team. [...] Jackson, Eastern Province's only representative at the trials, caused an upset when she claimed the wickets of Joy Irwin and Eleanor Lambert, Natal's record-breaking openers for only 20 runs. [...] Only {{the final day of the}} trial, she took the wickets of three of the previous day's high-scorers for 23 runs.|$|E
2500|$|The spell is {{explained}} as a complicated memory-altering magic. But {{it is not}} as simple as erasing the memory of everyone directly, as this is merely Subtractive Magic. Also, simply attempting to erase the memory because it uses Subtractive Magic, has a strong probability of destroying portions of the mind, thus killing the subject. A death spell, can for instance, make it seem like a person is dead, but everyone <b>still</b> <b>remembers</b> the person existed. [...] Also, if you tried to erase the knowledge of even a simple person like a woodcutter, the nature of reality would be such that all too obvious gaps in memory would be noticed, such as how the woodcutter's wife got her food and wood if she were crippled. For this reason, some wizards came up with a workaround, using some energy to warp reality itself or at least human perception of it. [...] False memories are automatically created to fill the gaps in reality, almost as if someone went back in time and changed them.|$|E

60|$|In this continual variety {{the mind}} is kept vividly alive. It is a changeful place to paint, a {{stirring}} place to live in.

The levity seems to have already impressed you. I am now reduced to showing you the obstinacy." [...] He {{sat down in a}} chair near the door and folded his arms, still beaming pleasantly at his uncle.|$|E
60|$|It {{is only to}} be {{regretted that}} the {{collection}} is not so extensive at it is interesting and choice. Perhaps its existence is not so generally known as it deserves to be. One would think that every Eton man would be as proud of his name being registered as a donor in the Catalogue of this Library, as a Venetian of his name being inscribed in the Golden Book. Indeed an old Etonian, who <b>still</b> <b>remembers</b> with tenderness the sacred scene of youth, could scarcely do better than build a Gothic apartment for the reception of the collection. It cannot be doubted that the Provost and fellows would be gratified in granting a piece of ground for the purpose.|$|E

60|$|Though Peter <b>still</b> <b>remembers</b> Maimie he is {{become as}} gay as ever, and often in sheer {{happiness}} he jumps off his goat and lies kicking merrily on the grass. Oh, {{he has a}} joyful time! But he has still a vague memory {{that he was a}} human once, and it makes him especially kind to the house-swallows when they revisit the island, for house-swallows are the spirits of little children who have died. They always build in the eaves of the houses where they lived when they were humans, and sometimes they try to fly in at a nursery window, and perhaps that is why Peter loves them best of all the birds.|$|E
60|$|Ernest. It cannot be. Much as I love my freedom, I love {{my honor}} more; and I am bound until my conqueror shall give back my plighted word, to seek no freedom till he shall bid me go. Nay, do not sigh, kind friend; I {{am no longer}} sad. From this day forth captivity is sweet. Tell thy fair {{mistress}} all my thanks are hers; but I may not take the gift she offers, for with freedom comes dishonor, and I cannot break my word to her stern father. Tell her she hath made my fetters light, this cell a happy home, by the sweet thought that she is near and <b>still</b> <b>remembers</b> one who looks upon the hour when first we met as the happiest he hath known.|$|E
60|$|They took a peep at the Temple and its garden.

It was all very well to know that Shakespeare's 'Twelfth Night' was played in Middle Temple Hall, that the York and Lancaster roses grew here, that Dr. Johnson lived No. 1 Inner Temple Lane, and that Goldsmith died No. 2 Brick Court, Middle Temple; these actual events and people seemed far less real than the scenes between Pendennis and Fanny, John Westlock and little Ruth Pinch. For their sakes Livy {{went to see the}} place; and for their sakes she <b>still</b> <b>remembers</b> that green spot in the heart of London, with the June sunshine falling on it as it fell that day.|$|E
