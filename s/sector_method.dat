Direct approaches such as the rotating <b>sector</b> <b>method</b> have restrictions that hinder their expansion or application to the wide variety of types of radical reactions of chemical interest. In addition, direct methods such as flash photolysis and pulse radiolysis require a relatively large amount of time and expensive equipment.

40|$|The SCIAMACHY {{instrument}} onboard the ESA satellite ENVISAT allows {{measurements of}} various atmospheric trace gases, such as NO 2. A unique feature of SCIAMACHY is that measurements are made alternately in limb and nadir mode. The limb measurements {{provide an opportunity}} for directly determining stratospheric column densities (CDs), which are needed to extract tropospheric CDs from the total CD measurements performed in (quasi simultaneous) nadir geometry. Here we discuss the potential and limitations of SCIAMACHY limb measurements for estimating stratospheric CDs of NO 2 in comparison to a simple reference <b>sector</b> <b>method,</b> and the consequences for the resulting tropospheric CDs. A direct, absolute limb correction scheme is presented that improves spatial patterns of tropospheric NO 2 column densities at high latitudes, but results in artificial zonal stripes at low latitudes. Subsequently, a relative limb correction scheme is introduced that successfully reduces stratospheric artefacts in the tropospheric data product without introducing new ones. This relative limb correction scheme is rather simple, robust, and, in essence, based on measurements alone. The effects of the different stratospheric estimation schemes on tropospheric CDs are discussed with respect to zonal and temporal dependencies. In addition, we define error quantities from the nadir/limb measurements that indicate remaining systematic errors as a function of latitude and day. Our new suggested stratospheric estimation scheme, the relative limb correction, improves mean tropospheric slant CDs significantly, e. g. from − 1 × 10 15 molec/cm 2 (using a reference <b>sector</b> <b>method)</b> to ≈ 0 in the Atlantic ocean, and from + 1 × 10 15 molec/cm 2 to ≈ 0 over Siberia, at 50 ° N in January 2003 – 2008...|$|E

Unstable cracking at moderate velocities (10 − 2 to 1 m sec − 1) seems to be produced by an isothermal/adiabatic transformation; an analysis for the onset of instability is given. At temperatures below 283 K, changes in toughness behaviour are seen, and below 243 K no stable cracking at all was obtained.

Results and discussions This investigation leads to the identification of the prevalence of non-market forms of medical care in the countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Furthermore, the health care system has a distinctive characteristic from other economic sectors: it is the intersection between social welfare and innovation systems. The relationship between technological innovation and cost in the health care sector is surveyed. Finally, the Brazilian case is discussed {{as an example of a}} developing country. Conclusion The peculiarities of labour in the health care sector suggest the need to recognize the worth of sectoral labour and to cease to treat it separately. This process should take into account the rapid development of the health innovation system and one important consequence: the obsolescence of the acquired knowledge.
