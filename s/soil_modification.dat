2500|$|Soil {{stabilization}} is {{the permanent}} {{physical and chemical}} alteration of soils to enhance their physical properties. Stabilization can increase the shear strength of a soil and/or control the shrink-swell properties of a soil, thus improving the load-bearing capacity of a sub-grade to support pavements and foundations. Stabilization {{can be used to}} treat a wide range of sub-grade materials from expansive clays to granular materials. Stabilization can be achieved with a variety of chemical additives including lime, fly ash, and Portland cement. Proper design and testing is an important component of any stabilization project. This allows for the establishment of design criteria, and determination of the proper chemical additive and admixture rate that achieves the desired engineering properties. Stabilization process benefits can include: Higher resistance (R) values, Reduction in plasticity, Lower permeability, Reduction of pavement thickness, Elimination of excavation - material hauling/handling - and base importation, Aids compaction, Provides [...] "all-weather" [...] access onto and within projects sites. Another form of soil treatment closely related to soil stabilization is <b>soil</b> <b>modification,</b> sometimes referred to as [...] "mud drying" [...] or soil conditioning. Although some stabilization inherently occurs in <b>soil</b> <b>modification,</b> the distinction is that <b>soil</b> <b>modification</b> is merely a means to reduce the moisture content of a soil to expedite construction, whereas stabilization can substantially increase the shear strength of a material such that it can be incorporated into the project's structural design. The determining factors associated with <b>soil</b> <b>modification</b> vs soil stabilization may be the existing moisture content, the end use of the soil structure and ultimately the cost benefit provided. Equipment for the stabilization and modification processes include: chemical additive spreaders, soil mixers (reclaimers), portable pneumatic storage containers, water trucks, deep lift compactors, motor graders.|$|E

The potential for significant <b>soil</b> <b>modification,</b> such as the development of authigenic carbonates and alteration of the generally expected background geotechnical properties may provide constraints to flowline routing, foundation installation and engineering lifetime performance. This paper presents {{a review of the}} current state of knowledge of the authors with special reference to recent investigations in deepwater offshore Angola, and a suggested method for identification, characterization and prediction. Interpretation of 3 D exploration seismic, enhanced by AUV (Chirp) data facilitates an initial identification of areas prone to hydrocarbon infiltration and the vertical and spatial extent of potential <b>soil</b> <b>modification.</b> A first pass geotechnical characterisation is developed by targeted seabed CPTs and soil sampling. The generation of an integrated predictive model requires a multidisciplinary advanced testing programme, including geophysical, geotechnical, geochemical and geological analyses. Once the extent, nature, and formative processes of hydrocarbon-related <b>soil</b> <b>modification</b> are understood, an assessment can be made of the challenges posed to a field development.

Pastures are {{the main}} source of energy and {{nutrients}} for dairy cows in the irrigated dairy region of northern Victoria, yet annual production and utilisation of pasture have remained static over the last 20 years. Previous small plot research has shown that pasture yields can be increased through systems of <b>soil</b> <b>modification</b> that improve soil structure and alleviate limitations to root growth. Wecompared the yield andnutritive characteristics of 4 forage species [tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea), lucerne (Medicago sativa), phalaris (Phalaris aquatica) and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) ] on soils which had been modified using commercially-available equipment and using spray irrigation at 2 frequencies. In year 1 (2000 – 01), annual yields of the forages were tall fescue: 21. 2 t dry matter (DM) /ha; lucerne: 20. 5 t DM/ha; phalaris: 19. 8 t DM/ha; and perennial ryegrass: 20. 8 t DM/ha. In the second year of the experiment, annual yields averaged 28. 9 t DM/ha for tall fescue, 26. 1 t DM/ha for lucerne, 31. 6 t DM/ha for phalaris and 23. 2 t DM/ha for perennial ryegrass.

The soil was a red-brown earth. The forages were spray irrigated fromAugust toMaywhen evaporationminus rainfall (E – R) reached 45 – 50 mm (frequent) or 90 – 100 mm (infrequent).

40|$|Invasive {{plants are}} capable of modifying {{attributes}} of soil to facilitate further invasion by conspecifics and other invasive species. We assessed this capability in three important plant invaders of grasslands in the Great Plains region of North America: leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula), smooth brome (Bromus inermis) and crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum). In a glasshouse, these three invasives {{or a group of}} native species were grown separately through three cycles of growth and soil conditioning in both steam-pasteurized and non-pasteurized soils, after which we assessed seedling growth in these soils. Two of the three invasive species, Bromus and Agropyron, exhibited significant self-facilitation via <b>soil</b> <b>modification.</b> Bromus and Agropyron also had significant facilitative effects on other invasives via <b>soil</b> <b>modification,</b> while Euphorbia had significant antagonistic effects on the other invasives. Both Agropyron and Euphorbia consistently suppressed growth of two of three native forbs, while three native grasses were generally less affected. Almost all intra- and interspecific effects of invasive soil conditioning were dependent upon presence of soil biota from field sites where these species were successful invaders. Overall, these results suggest that that invasive modification of soil microbiota can facilitate plant invasion directly or via ‘cross-facilitation’ of other invasive species, and moreover has potential to impede restoration of native communities after removal of an invasive species. However, certain native species that are relatively insensitive to altered soil biota (as we observed {{in the case of the}} forb Linum lewisii and the native grasses), may be valuable as ‘nurse’ species in restoration efforts...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Due to {{the similar}} {{dielectric}} constants of buried nonmetallic targets and dry soils, {{it is often}} difficult to detect and identify nonmetallic targets with ground penetrating radar. The addition of properly chosen chemical agents to modify soil properties can potentially provide improved detection. Previous studies using waveguide experiments have shown that the addition of water improves dielectric contrasts but also increases loss so that target detectability is not necessarily improved. The addition of liquid nitrogen to wet soils can reduce background medium loss and restore target visibility, and waveguide studies of target detection through controlled depth of nitrogen penetration have shown that scattering can be significantly enhanced if an optimal amount of nitrogen is added. In this paper, a simple physical optics (PO) model for scattering from a three-dimensional target buried below a half space is presented, and it is shown that the radar cross section of the target depends on the dielectric contrast with and attenuation in the background medium. The model is validated through comparison with a Method of Moments code and found to yield accurate predictions for near normal incidence geometries. Analytical studies of target detection with two concepts of <b>soil</b> <b>modification</b> are then described: obtaining an “optimal ” homogeneous soil water content and the addition of a large quantity of water along with an optimal amount of liquid nitrogen. Finally, initial tests of these <b>soil</b> <b>modification</b> techniques with a dielectric rod antenna ground penetrating radar are performed and demonstrate that the addition of liquid nitrogen to excessively wet soils can reduce loss and enhance target visibility.

40|$|Three {{economic}} {{analyses were conducted}} {{on the results of}} dairy forage production experiments undertaken in Victoria. The first analysis investigated the level of pasture production increases {{that would have to be}} achieved to warrant the investment in different <b>soil</b> <b>modification</b> options. This analysis took pasture production data and using a computer program "UDDER" (Larcombe 1990) generated farm data which was then applied to development budgets. The increase in pasture growth rate required was such that it is unlikely that investment in the <b>soil</b> <b>modification</b> systems tested here will produce a satisfactory return on investment. The second analysis investigated the use of different pasture species combinations on a dairy farm in northern Victoria. A linear programming model was developed that balanced the energy requirements of the milking herd with the energy supplied from pasture and supplements. The results showed that the most profitable mix of pasture depended on the energy supply profile of the pasture and the requirements of the herd. The proportion of autumn and spring calving cows in the herd in part determined the most profitable pasture mix. The effect of grazing management on profit was the subject of the third study. A farm model was constructed that balanced the energy, protein and neutral detergent fibre requirements of the milking herd with that supplied by pasture and supplements and optimised operating profit. The results of a grazing trial conducted in south-west Victoria were entered into the model and the operating profits for each treatment compared. The results suggested that while Operating profit was related to total pasture consumption, the timing of the pasture consumption impacted on operating profit. The results also suggested that grazing frequency may have affected operating profit more than grazing intensity. Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|E
