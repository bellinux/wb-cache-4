40|$|Sea <b>star</b> <b>tube</b> feet {{consist of}} an {{enlarged}} and flattened distal extremity (the disc), which makes {{contact with the}} substratum, and a proximal contractile cylinder (the stem), which acts as a tether. In this study, the different forces brought into play during tube foot functioning were investigated in two related species. The tube feet of Asterias rubens and Marthasterias glacialis attach to glass with a similar mean tenacity (0. 24 and 0. 43 MPa, respectively), corresponding to an estimated maximal attachment force of 0. 15 and 0. 35 N. The contraction force of their retractor muscle averages 0. 017 N. The variation of the retractor muscle contraction with its extension ratio follows a typical bell-shaped length-tension curve in which a maximal contraction of approximately 0. 04 N is obtained for an extension ratio of approximately 2. 3 in both sea star species. The tensile strength of the tube foot stem was investigated considering the two tissues that could assume a load-bearing function, i. e. the retractor muscle and the connective tissue. The latter is a mutable collagenous tissue presenting a fivefold difference in tensile strength between its soft and stiff state. In our experiments, stiffening was induced by disrupting cell membranes or by modifying the ionic composition of the bathing solution. Finally, the force needed to break the tube foot retractor muscle was found to account for 18 - 25 % of the tube foot total breaking force, showing that, although the connective tissue is the tissue layer that supports most of the load exerted on the stem, {{the contribution of the}} retractor muscle cannot be neglected in sea stars. All these forces appear well-balanced for proper functioning of the tube feet during the activities of the sea star. They are discussed in the context of two essential activities: The opening of bivalve shells and the maintenance of position in exposed habitats. © 2010. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

The present investigation is concerned with the physics of the escape of net azimuthal flux from a star.

The buoyancy of an isolated horizontal magnetic flux tube beneath the surface of a <b>star</b> causes the <b>tube</b> to rise at a rate comparable to the Alfven speed. The necessary conditions for escape of the flux are considered along with aspects of magnetic buoyancy, and the conditions on the sun.

40|$|The "warp drive" metric {{recently}} {{presented by}} Alcubierre has {{the problem that}} an observer {{at the center of}} the warp bubble is causally separated from the outer edge of the bubble wall.

We analyze and generalize a metric, originally proposed by Krasnikov for two spacetime dimensions, which does not suffer from the first difficulty. As a consequence, the Krasnikov metric has the interesting property that although the time for a one-way trip to a distant star cannot be shortened, the time for a round trip, as measured by clocks on Earth, can be made arbitrarily short. In our four dimensional extension of this metric, a "tube" is constructed along the path of an outbound spaceship, which connects the Earth and the <b>star.</b> Inside the <b>tube</b> spacetime is flat, but the light cones are opened out so as to allow superluminal travel in one direction.

40|$|Sea {{stars are}} common {{invertebrates}} that inhabit all oceans. These organisms {{belong to the}} phylum Echinodermata, which include sea cucumbers, sand dollars and sea urchins. The sea star Pisaster ocharaceus is native to the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Northern Alaska to Northern California. They appear in different color morphs, ranging from purple to orange and even brown. Like other sea <b>stars</b> they have <b>tube</b> feet, which give them {{the ability to move}} and secure themselves on any surface, making it difficult for predators, including humans to obtain it. They normally thrive on common bivalves such as muscles, but also consume barnacles and chitons, however during their larval stage they mostly feed on algae. Using their tube feet they can latch on to different prey and bring them to their mouth to feast. Pisaster ochraceus is known to have its mating Pisaster sea stars have separate sexes, which can be determined by making a slight incision {{at the base of the}} arm and locating the gonads, which will contain either sperm or eggs.. Many sea stars have the capacity to regenerate body parts lost during their lifetime, but only in their adult stages. However, I am more interested in learning about this mechanism during their larval stage. Not only does regeneration affect different organs in the specimen, but also different cells (Carnevali 2006). This paper will show the processes of obtaining the specimens, bisecting the larval sea stars, and finally displaying them in different colors, allowing viewers to not only see the common organs such as the mouth, anus, esophagus and stomach, but also different muscle tissues.

30|$|Nanostructured {{materials}}, {{which are}} defined as materials with structural elements, such as clusters, crystallites or molecules, with dimensions in the 1 to 100 -nm range, have been the interest of both academic and industrial fields {{over the past few}} decades because nanosize scaling allows materials to exhibit novel and significantly improved physical, chemical, and biological properties [1 – 3]. In addition, nanostructures can provide unprecedented understanding on materials and devices. For these reasons, fabrication methods and characterizations of various nanostructured materials have been extensively investigated. Zinc oxide (ZnO), with a wide band gap (3.37 [*]eV), has been actively studied due to its excellent chemical/electrical/optical properties and the ease of nanostructure growth applicable to nanoscale functional devices, such as sensors, solar cells, light emitting diodes, and ultraviolet lasers [4 – 7]. It is important to fabricate and control the nanostructure size, density, and shape to produce ZnO nanostructures for specific purposes. ZnO nanostructures in the shapes of rods, belts, nails, <b>tubes,</b> <b>stars,</b> and flowers have been prepared by the thermal evaporation of zinc powder and hydrothermal synthesis [8 – 12]. Metal organic chemical vapor deposition, spray pyrolysis, laser ablation, sputter deposition, and template-assisted growth synthesis methods are typically employed for these nanostructures. In particular, synthesis of ZnO via a chemical solution route provides an easy and convenient method and is very effective for scale-up, even at low temperature. In this hydrothermal method, various shapes and dimensions of ZnO nanostructures can be obtained by tuning the pH, process temperature, concentration of precursors, and seed layer [13 – 16]. Among them, the seed layer plays an important role in promoting high-density nucleation through reduction of the thermodynamic barrier [16]. Although previous results have demonstrated methods for successful control of the ZnO nanostructure shape, there are additional challenging factors in ZnO nanostructure growth such as (a) preparation of a pure ZnO chemical composition without undesired element incorporation from a seed layer and (b) production of preferential structural growth over large areas [17 – 19]. The latter factor is crucial to maximize reactive sites of ZnO in specific orientations for surface chemical applications (e.g., gas sensor and heterogeneous catalysis supports). In this regard, achievement of large areas with a (100) ZnO surface orientation is very useful as it has reactive O- and Zn-polar sites [20 – 22]; however, this part remains a technical challenge in ZnO nanostructure.|$|R
