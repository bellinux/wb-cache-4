5|$|Egypt in 2015 {{reportedly}} {{expressed an}} interest again in the JF-17 despite buying French and Russian planes earlier that year. This has come as a <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> analysts who had considered the possibility of Egypt acquiring the JF-17 to be lost.|$|E
5|$|According to plan, the Syrians {{attacked}} {{from the}} southern Golan Heights, {{just south of the}} Sea of Galilee through al-Hama and the Yarmouk River, hitting a densely populated Jewish area of settlement. This came as a <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> the Haganah, which expected an attack from south Lebanon and Mishmar HaYarden. The Jewish villages on the original confrontation line were Ein Gev, Masada, Sha'ar HaGolan and both Deganias.|$|E

5|$|Following {{extensive}} {{discussions on}} the fighting ability of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam, the Political Bureau approved the General Staff’s plan, which had selected the Central Highlands as the main battlefield for the upcoming offensive. The Central Highlands campaign was codenamed ‘Campaign 275’ and {{the goal was to}} capture the city of Ban Me Thuot. To achieve that objective, North Vietnamese General Văn Tiến Dũng placed great emphasis on the principles of massed force, secrecy, and <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> draw South Vietnamese forces away from the main objective. For the element of <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> be successful, North Vietnamese forces needed to launch strong diversionary attacks on Pleiku and Kon Tum, thereby leaving Ban Me Thuot completely exposed. Once the element of surprise had been achieved, the North Vietnamese would mass their forces on Ban Me Thuot, and prevent South Vietnamese reinforcements from retaking the city.|$|E

5|$|Only one of {{the small}} {{detachment}} of marines on board participated in the mutiny. While the half-dozen remaining were too outnumbered and taken by <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> fulfill their role of shipboard police and oppose the mutineers, they did insist on being treated as prisoners of war by the Spanish and were accordingly exchanged six months later, along with the surviving warrant officers.|$|E

5|$|Pre-election public-opinion polls {{had promised}} victory to the communists. Thus the total {{defeat of the}} PZPR and its {{satellite}} parties came as a <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> all involved: {{after the first round}} of elections, it became evident that Solidarity had fared extremely well, capturing 160 of 161 contested Sejm seats, and 92 of 100 Senate seats. After the second round, it had won virtually every seat—all 161 in the Sejm, and 99 in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} not commercially acclaimed, which {{came as a}} <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> Sire since they had insisted the band record with Gouldman {{in an effort to}} {{increase}} fan-base; it peaked at number fifty-eight on the Billboard 200 and only charted outside of the US in Sweden. The album was not critically acclaimed either, as it received several mixed articles by reviewers, who insisted the album to be less playable than their first four albums.|$|E
5|$|The defense {{continued}} a {{few more}} days with testimony from a Navy psychiatrist who verified that the immense explosion would generate fear in each man. A black petty officer under Delucchi testified that he had heard no derogatory remarks or conspiratorial comments and that it had been a <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> everybody when all of the men suddenly refused to march toward the docks on August 9.|$|E

5|$|Allied {{planners}} considered tactical <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> be {{a necessary}} {{element of the}} plan for the landings. Information on the exact date and location of the landings was provided only to the topmost levels of the armed forces. Men were sealed into their marshalling areas {{at the end of}} May, with no further communication with the outside world. Troops were briefed using maps that were correct in every detail except for the place names, and most were not told their actual destination until they were already at sea. A news blackout in Britain increased the effectiveness of the deception operations. Travel to and from the Republic of Ireland was banned, and movement within several kilometres of the coast of England restricted.|$|E
5|$|At the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con, a {{preliminary}} teaser trailer (labeled as TR2N {{and directed by}} Joseph Kosinski) was shown as a <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> convention guests. It depicted a yellow Program engaged in a light cycle battle with a blue Program, and it prominently featured Jeff Bridges reprising his role as an aged Kevin Flynn (from the first film). At {{the end of the}} trailer, the yellow Program showed his face, which appeared identical to Flynn's earlier program Clu (resembling the younger Flynn in Tron).|$|E
5|$|Darabont's {{departure}} as showrunner in July 2011 {{during the}} second season came as <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> many, as it came shortly after the season's premiere {{and a few days}} after that year's Comic-Con, where Darabont helped to promote the show. It was speculated that he was unable to adjust to the schedule of running a television series. However, The Hollywood Reporter reported that AMC had fired him. There had been reported difficulties in the production of the second season, including disputes over planned budget cuts and executive meddling, and it was known that Darabont and AMC had several discussions relating to these factors. However, neither Darabont, AMC, nor the cast nor crew of The Walking Dead spoke about the reasons for his firing.|$|E

5|$|Elgar's {{recordings}} {{were released}} on 78-rpm discs by both HMV and RCA Victor. After World War II, the 1932 {{recording of the}} Violin Concerto with the teenage Menuhin as soloist remained available on 78 and later on LP, but the other recordings {{were out of the}} catalogues for some years. When they were reissued by EMI on LP in the 1970s, they caused <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> many by their fast tempi, in contrast to the slower speeds adopted by many conductors in the years since Elgar's death. The recordings were reissued on CD in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his fifth}} Stanley Cup win, with Toronto, the New York Rangers claimed Olmstead in the Intra-League Draft on June 4, 1962. This {{came as a}} <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> Olmstead, who refused {{to report to the}} team. The Canadiens offered to acquire him from the Rangers, within a month; Olmstead demanded an {{immediate}} trade. Since no deal came, he retired at the age of 35. During his 14-year NHL career, Olmstead scored 181goals and 421assists, for 602points; in the playoffs, he collected 59points, in 115games. In his 14seasons, Olmstead appeared in the Stanley Cup final 11times. He won five times, four of them with the Montreal Canadiens, and once with the Toronto Maple Leafs.|$|E
5|$|Further {{attacks were}} {{conducted}} against Saipan during late November {{in an attempt}} to disrupt the American offensive. On November24, Marianas-based B-29s conducted their first raid against Japan, bombing targets in and around Tokyo. Three days later the Japanese mounted two raids against their bases. During the early hours of November27, two G4Ms flying from Iwo Jima struck Isley Field from low altitude and escaped after destroying one B-29 and damaging eleven others. This attack came as a <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> the Americans, and construction lights were still on at Isley {{at the start of the}} raid.|$|E

"We were <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> {{find it in}} the {{possession}} of such men," [...] replied Harnett, with a laugh, [...] "and perhaps also a little <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> learn that we could have put so much faith in any one of your assertions. But now, with such eminent authority on the subject, I am anxious to get back, and look at the land for myself." ...|$|R

5|$|General Bell {{had been}} the manager {{of one of the}} coal mines in Cripple Creek where the strike was taking place. It wasn't any <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> Haywood that {{soldiers}} seemed to be working {{in the interests of the}} employers; he had seen that situation before. But when the Colorado legislature acknowledged the complaints of organized labor and passed an eight hour law, the Colorado supreme court declared it unconstitutional. So the WFM took the issue to the voters, and 72 percent of the state's voters approved the referendum. But the Colorado government ignored the results of the referendum.|$|E
5|$|In {{the battles}} of Modrica and Meçad 7,000 Ottoman forces were left {{dead on the}} {{battlefield}} along with thousands of horses. The Albanians had suffered 1,000 casualties themselves and, in their exhaustion, they refused to pursue the fleeing Ottoman forces. Hamza Pasha and his staff were ransomed to the sultan. Raimon d'Ortafà reported Skanderbeg's victory to Alfonso who received it with great exuberance. Skanderbeg's victory over a ruler even more powerful than Murad came as a great <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> the Albanians. Skanderbeg's reputation among his allies was redeemed and the Dukagjini opted for a reconciliation.|$|E
5|$|In the end, the Russian {{declaration}} of war came as a <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> both Carol and Kogălniceanu, {{who had not been}} informed of the exact date (April 23) when the Imperial Russian Army would start moving into Moldavia—hence, Romanians tended to regard it as an invasion. Also alarming for Kogălniceanu, the official Russian proclamation addressed Romanians as protegés of the Empire. Bilateral tensions were somewhat alleviated by Russian apologies and, later, by the Ottoman pledge to annex Romania; addressing a discontented Parliament, Kogălniceanu asserted that the Russian road was the country's only choice.|$|E
