5|$|By now {{the castle}} was in disrepair, and the bailey and the {{earthworks}} {{were covered with}} a combination of pigsties, cabbage gardens and a <b>skittle</b> alley used by a local pub. Local tradition states that the visiting Queen of Portugal, Maria II of Portugal, complained about the condition of the site to Queen Victoria, which resulted in Hugh Percy, the 3rd Duke of Northumberland and the castle's constable, landscaping the area to create a public park between 1840 and 1842 at a cost of £3,000. The south gatehouse was repaired, and the remains of the north gatehouse turned into stables. Hugh sold off his local interests in 1864 and the Northumberlands' control of the post of constable lapsed with the death of his brother Algernon Percy, the 4th duke, the following year. The post lay vacant until in 1883 the local Member of Parliament, Hardinge Giffard, was appointed as the constable by the then Prince Edward in his capacity as the Duke of Cornwall.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall {{showed his}} {{versatility}} {{again in the}} First Test in Brisbane, scoring an unbeaten 38 in the second innings to extend Australia's lead to 373. When South Africa attempted to chase the target, Lindwall took 5/60 to cut them down 96 runs short of victory. Lindwall was reunited with Miller when the latter returned from injury for the Second Test at Melbourne, and despite the old combination taking 12 wickets, with Lindwall taking match figures of 5/116, Australia fell 82 runs short and South Africa had its first Test win against Australia in 42 years. The teams moved to the home ground of Miller and Lindwall for the Third Test in Sydney, and the local pair delivered, taking seven wickets between them to <b>skittle</b> the tourists for 173, with Lindwall taking 4/40. With Australia having taken a 270 first innings lead, Lindwall allowed Australia to seize the initiative, removing both openers in his first three overs, before ending with 4/72 to ensure an innings victory and a 2–1 series lead. The value of Lindwall and Miller were demonstrated during the final two Tests. At the Fourth Test in Adelaide, both broke down mid-game and left Australia two bowlers short. Chasing 377, the South Africans managed {{to stave off the}} bowling and secure a draw. Both were absent for the Fifth Test in Melbourne and South Africa capitalised, defeating the Australians by six wickets despite the home side having scored 520 in their first innings. The absence of Lindwall and Miller's new ball partnership allowed South Africa to fight back and draw the series 2–2, making it the first series that Australia had not won since 1938. Lindwall had taken 19 wickets at 20.16 in just three and a half Tests for the series, and Australia seemed unlikely to find replacements for their leading strike pair anytime soon; their eventual successors Richie Benaud and Alan Davidson were still to become regular internationals.|$|E

The skittles are placed on a square court, each resting on a round piece of wood called pitere or pitet, 2.20m apart from each other. A <b>skittle</b> measures about 96cm and weighs 3kg, and is made of beech wood. The bowl (ball) weighs about 6kg and has a 30cm diameter; it is made of walnut wood. There is also an eight-pin version, quilles de huit (8), and a version played with a mallet, quilles au maillet, which is obviously related to ground billiards and its variants such as croquet and paille-maille, and which has experienced a resurgence in Gascony since 1973.|$|E

25|$|A Player scoring no pins after bowling three {{balls in}} the leg is known as scoring a 'Spider'.

The maximum score in a 9-pin frame is 27, however this is virtually unheard of, the highest spare {{in the history of the}} Worcester and District was thought to be a 24 scored by Gary Sandbrook whilst playing for the Independents <b>Skittle</b> team in the early 1990s, the highest spare in the friendly league was achieved by Scott Heywood with a full house score of 27 at the Alma tavern whilst playing for the Rushwick Cavalier on 18 September 2014.
