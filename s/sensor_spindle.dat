This paper describes a condition monitoring system applied to the spindle of a NC machining centre. During idle run the acoustic emission and vibrations were measured using sensors installed in prepared places. A large number of tests were carried out with varying <b>sensor</b> location, <b>spindle</b> rotating speed and spindle load. Measurements were performed in real industrial environment nine times with six weeks intervals in order to obtain trends. The spindle run out was determined at every measurement time as well...|$|R
30|$|The spindle is {{the core}} {{component}} with complex assembly mechanical structure in heavy-duty CNC machine tool. The spindle consists of the rotating shaft, {{the front and rear}} bearings, and the spindle base. For the motorized spindle, it also includes the rotor and stator. As the structure of the spindle is very compact and narrow, to fix the temperature <b>sensor</b> inside the <b>spindle</b> is difficult. The thermogenesis of spindle’s front bearings is a research hotspot that has great influence to the thermal error of the heavy-duty CNC machine tool.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} new method {{to predict the}} spindle {{deformation}} based on temperature data. The method introduces ANFIS (adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system). For building the predictive model, we first extract temperature data from <b>sensors</b> in the <b>spindle,</b> and then they are used as the inputs to train ANFIS. To evaluate {{the performance of the}} prediction, an experiment is implemented. Three Pt- 100 thermal resistances is used to monitor the spindle temperature, and an inductive current sensor is used to obtain the spindle deformation. The experimental results display that our prediction model can better predict the spindle deformation and improve the performance of the spindle...|$|R
40|$|In this {{research}} work, the authors use displacement <b>sensors</b> in the <b>spindle</b> structure to monitor cutting forces for intelligent machining. However, the monitoring {{quality in the}} long term is a problem because sensor signals involve offset drift, which is mainly attributable to the thermal displacement of the spindle. To solve this problem, we attached thermal sensors in the machine and cooling system. The estimation of the spindle thermal displacement based on temperature data from these thermal sensors can provide more information for monitoring of cutting forces. For accurate monitoring of cutting forces, thermal displacement compensation scheme is proposed, and the monitoring tests of cutting forces in end milling operations are carried out as cases study. With thermal displacement compensation scheme implemented, the experimental result shows that the monitoring of small and medium scale cutting forces is possible, if cutting process is intermittent...|$|R
40|$|When {{people are}} asked to palpate a novel soft object to discern its {{physical}} properties such as texture, elasticity, and even non-homogeneity, they not only regulate probing behaviors, but also the co-contraction level of antagonistic muscles to control the mechanical impedance of fingers. It is suspected that such behavior tries to enhance haptic perception by regulating the function of mechanoreceptors at different depths of the fingertips and proprioceptive sensors such as tendon and <b>spindle</b> <b>sensors</b> located in muscles. In this paper, we designed and fabricated a novel two-degree of freedom variable stiffness indentation probe to investigate whether the regulation of internal stiffness, indentation, and probe sweeping velocity (PSV) variables affect {{the accuracy of the}} depth estimation of stiff inclusions in an artificial silicon phantom using information gain metrics. Our experimental results provide new insights into not only the biological phenomena of haptic perception but also new opportunities to design and control soft robotic probes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Any passive rigid {{inertial}} {{object that}} we hold in our hand, e. g., a tennis racquet, imposes {{a field of}} forces on the arm that depends on limb position, velocity, and acceleration. A fundamental characteristic of this field is that the forces due to acceleration and velocity are linearly separable in the intrinsic coordinates of the limb. In order to learn such dynamics {{with a collection of}} basis elements, a control system would generalize correctly and therefore perform optimally if the basis elements that were sensitive to limb velocity were not sensitive to acceleration, and vice versa. However, in the mammalian nervous system proprioceptive <b>sensors</b> like muscle <b>spindles</b> encode a nonlinear combination of all components of limb state, with sensitivity to velocity dominating sensitivity to acceleration. Therefore, limb state in the space of proprioception is not linearly separable despite the fact that this separation is a desirable property of control systems that form models of inertial objects. In building internal models of limb dynamics, does the brain use a representation that is optimal for control of inertial objects, or a representation that is closely tied to how peripheral sensors measure limb state? Here we show that in humans, patterns of generalization of reaching movements in acceleration-dependent fields are strongly inconsistent with basis elements that are optimized for control of inertial objects. Unlike a robot controller that models the dynamics of th...|$|R
40|$|This work {{documents}} {{an investigation}} of the degradation of a variety of different tools whilst conducting milling operations on a computer numerical controlled (CNC) milling machine. The potential of a range of sensors to detect tool degradation has been investigated and the outputs have been incorporated into a monitoring system. Progressive degradation under nominal rough and finish face milling and rough groove milling has been investigated using a two point grooving tool and four and eight point face milling tools on En 8, En 24 and En 24 T workpiece materials. Rapid degradation of the cutting tool has also been observed under rough milling conditions using four and eight point face milling tools, whilst machining n 8 and En 24 T materials in a variety of simulated and actual tool breakage situations. A limited investigation of the effect of the individual wear geometries associated with both progressive and instantaneous tool degradation has been conducted by simulating these geometries and carrying out rough miffing tests using a four point face milling tool on a workpiece of En 8 material. Similarly, a limited investigation of the effect of machining on different machines has also been undertaken. A number of different sensing technologies have been used, including conventional <b>sensors</b> such as <b>spindle</b> current and cutting force but also novel sensing techniques such as Acoustic Emission. These have been combined using artificial intelligence techniques to provide automatic recognition of the tool wear state. Similarly, the feasibility of breakage detection/prediction has also been demonstrated. CEC - BRITE EURAM Programm...|$|R
40|$|The lack of multi-scale {{empirical}} measurements (e. g. recording simultaneously from neurons, muscles, whole body, etc.) complicates {{understanding of}} sensorimotor function in humans. This {{is particularly true}} for the understanding of development during childhood, which requires evaluation of measurements over many years. We have developed a synthetic platform for emulating multi-scale activity of the vertebrate sensorimotor system. Our design benefits from Very Large Scale Integrated-circuit (VLSI) technology to provide considerable scalability and high-speed, as much as 365 x faster than real-time. An essential component of our design is the proprioceptive <b>sensor,</b> or muscle <b>spindle.</b> Here we demonstrate an accurate and extremely fast emulation of a muscle spindle and its spiking afferents, which are computationally expensive but fundamental for reflex functions. We implemented a well-known rate-based model of the spindle (Mileusnic et al., 2006) and a simplified spiking sensory neuron model using the Izhikevich approximation to the Hodgkin-Huxley model. The resulting behavior of our afferent sensory system is qualitatively compatible with classic cat soleus recording (Matthews, 1964; 1972; Crowe and Matthews, 1964 b). Our results suggest that this simplified structure of the spindle and afferent neuron is sufficient to produce physiologically-realistic behavior. The VLSI technology allows us to accelerate this behavior beyond 365 x real-time. Our goal is to use this testbed for predicting years of disease progression {{with only a few}} days of emulation. This is the first hardware emulation of the spindle afferent system, and it may have application not only for emulation of human health and disease, but also for the construction of compliant neuromorphic robotic systems...|$|R
40|$|Fish {{possess a}} greater degree of agility, maneuverability, and energy {{efficiency}} over current underwater vehicles constructed by engineers. Kinematics studies show that a high degree of three-dimensional control of multiple active surfaces distributed around an undersea vehicle's center of mass is critical to achieve fish-like superior performance. However, current technology has yet to exploit the use of actively controlled surfaces for underwater locomotion. Major obstacles limiting effectively achieving designs capable of active deformations in multiple degrees of freedom lie in the complexity associated with traditional actuators and their associated manufacturing techniques. Conducting polymers possess numerous desirable physical and active properties which make it possible to grow rather than build artificial muscles for an articulated device. Their potential for co-fabrication make it possible to implement simpler more integrated designs as they have been shown to provide all the basic elements required for a Biomimetic robot including: force sensors (analogous to the Golgi organs in tendons), strain <b>sensors</b> (like muscle <b>spindles),</b> structural elements (such as bones, joints, and webbing), and actuators (akin to muscle). Rapid prototyping and molding techniques were used to begin the development of a co-fabrication process for a pectoral fin which will be made from and actuated by conducting polymers. Conducting polymer actuators provide the necessary structural flexibility while exceeding the 800 kN/m² force requirements typical of fish muscle by 40 fold. (cont.)

40|$|The {{encapsulated}} sensory endings of mammalian skeletal {{muscles are}} all mechanoreceptors. At {{the most basic}} functional level they serve as length <b>sensors</b> (muscle <b>spindle</b> primary and secondary endings), tension sensors (tendon organs), and pressure or vibration sensors (lamellated corpuscles). At a higher functional level, the differing roles of individual muscles in, for example, postural adjustment and locomotion {{might be expected to}} be reflected in characteristic complements of the various end-organs, their sensory endings and afferent nerve fibres. This has previously been demonstrated with regard to the number of muscle-spindle capsules; however, information on the other types of end-organ, as well as the complements of primary and secondary endings of the spindles themselves, is sporadic and inconclusive regarding their comparative provision in different muscles. Our general conclusion that muscle-specific variability in the provision of encapsulated sensory endings does exist demonstrates the necessity for the acquisition of more data of this type if we are to understand the underlying adaptive relationships between motor control and the structure and function of skeletal muscle. The present quantitative and comparative analysis of encapsulated muscle afferents is based on teased, silver-impregnated preparations. We begin with a statistical analysis of the number and distribution of muscle-spindle afferents in hind-limb muscles of the cat, particularly tenuissimus. We show that: (i) taking account of the necessity for at least one primary ending to be present, muscles differ significantly in the mean number of additional afferents per spindle capsule; (ii) the frequency of occurrence of spindles with different sensory complements is consistent with a stochastic, rather than deterministic, developmental process; and (iii) notwithstanding the previous finding, there is a differential distribution of spindles intramuscularly such that the more complex ones tend to be located closer to the main divisions of the nerve. Next, based on a sample of tendon organs from several hind-foot muscles of the cat, we demonstrate the existence in at least a large proportion of tendon organs of a structural substrate to account for multiple spike-initiation sites and pacemaker switching, namely the distribution of sensory terminals supplied by the different first-order branches of the Ib afferent to separate, parallel, tendinous compartments of individual tendon organs. We then show that the numbers of spindles, tendon organs and paciniform corpuscles vary independently in a sample of (mainly) hind-foot muscles of the cat. Grouping muscles by anatomical region in the cat indicated the existence of a gradual proximo-distal decline in the overall average size of the afferent complement of muscle spindles from axial through hind limb to intrinsic foot muscles, but with considerable muscle-specific variability. Finally, we present some comparative data on muscle-spindle afferent complements of rat, rabbit and guinea pig, one particularly notable feature being the high incidence of multiple primary endings in the rat...|$|R
40|$|The aim {{of flight}} {{simulation}} {{is to create}} an environment for the pilot wherein he or she can perform the piloting task {{in such a way that}} the objective of the simulation, training or research, is reached. To simulate the flight environment in a simulator models describing the aircraft dynamic behavior and its systems, the atmosphere, the geographical and navigational environment, etc. are used. To fulfill his task, the pilot needs to perceive all relevant information and must have the means to control the simulated aircraft. This means that the pilot-aircraft interface, the cockpit with all its displays and controls, the aircraft motions, etc. has to be simulated accurately so that the pilot can perform in the simulator as in the real aircraft. Not only all cockpit systems have to provide the pilot with the proper stimulation of his senses but also the cockpit controls need to produce the proper control force-stick displacement characteristics. To make that possible not only all aircraft systems to be simulated have to be understood but also all human systems i. e. the characteristics of the senses (visual, vestibular, auditory, proprioceptive, etc.) and the actuation mechanisms have to be known. Based on this broad knowledge the pilot - aircraft interface for simulation can be specified, designed and employed. The MST Motion Working Group is currently documenting on the human capabilities and simulator systems. In this paper the neuromuscular system will be discussed. Both the physiology of the muscle and the <b>sensors,</b> the muscle <b>spindle</b> and the Golgi tendon organ, and the components of the nervous system regulating the force and position of the limb, as well as the adaptation of the neuromusculosketal system to the task requirements are discussed. Recently a neuromusculosketal system model was developed at Delft University. This model is used to explain the adaptation to three typical tasks in response to stick forces: resisting forces (maintaining a constant position), ignoring forces (minimizing muscle activity) and giving way to them (maintaining a constant force). Based on the model it is shown which parts of the system are adaptable and how the model parameters change to adapt the admittance, the external force/displacement characteristic, to the task.

40|$|In {{an effort}} to {{increase}} machining efficiency and minimize costs, research into tool condition monitoring (TCM) systems has focused on developing methods to allow for unmanned machining. For drilling processes, such systems typically use indirect approaches to monitoring the tool condition by measuring spindle torque and feed force as well as vibrations including acoustic emission (AE – mechanical vibrations faster than 100 kHz). This project aimed to advance the state-of-the-art {{in the area of}} TCM by developing a method to detect sudden tool failures in large diameter (> 25 mm) indexable insert drills. This project was a continuation of the research conducted by Mr. R. Griffin (a former MSc student), who developed a model capable of predicting long term wear trends in indexable insert drills [1]. Notably, his model was unable to react to sudden tool breakage due to tool chipping, which was addressed by this project as presented in this thesis. In order to develop and train models able to detect sudden tool failure, an experiment was developed and installed in the field of the industry partner of this project. The experiment’s main feature was a pair of AE sensors added to the existing torque and force sensors. On this setup, experiments were conducted by drilling 2251 holes in workpieces using indexable insert drills with or without the insert breaking. When drilling holes without the insert breaking, the holes were named as good ones; and when drilling holes with the insert breaking they were named as bad holes. During the drilling process, data was collected from current sensors attached to the spindle motor and feed motor as well as from an AE <b>sensor</b> on the <b>spindle</b> and on the workpiece. From the signals from the spindle motor current and feed motor current sensors, algorithms were developed to identify and divide the signals of drilling a hole into different sections of the drilling cycle (i. e. entrance, steady-state, exit, etc.). Steady-state time-domain features were extracted from the sensor signals measured for all holes drilled in the experiments and the extracted features were used to train and test the classifier models. These models were cross validated to determine which type of model was the best fit for the drilling data collected. The results from the classifier models show that most of the classifiers tested have the ability to identify sudden tool breakage based on the data recorded in the present study, with varying degrees of success. The naïve Bayes classifier was able to detect the most failures but suffered from a large number of falsely detected failures. Both the classification tree and linear discriminant analysis classifiers had lower failure detection rates than the naïve Bayes classifier, but did not suffer from the same amount of false positives; as such, these two classifiers had higher overall classification rates than the naïve Bayes. These results suggest that classification tree and linear discriminant analysis methods are better suited for the drilling application and that the time-domain features should be complemented by others, such as the features extracted from the frequency domain, to accurately diagnose the tool condition. Future research should focus on extracting frequency and time-frequency domain features as these features might contain more information on tool condition. In addition, methods of examining features at the entrance and exit of the holes should be investigated as these two points in the drilling cycle are the most prone to sudden tool failure...|$|R
40|$|Milling is a {{processing}} technology massively {{applied in}} the metal manufacturing industry. The continuous demand for higher productivity and product quality asks for better understanding {{and control of the}} machining process. A better understanding can be achieved through experimental measurement and theoretical simulations and modelling of the process and its resulting product. In particular process monitoring and control is desirable for automated control and optimization of the process and in turn of productivity and product quality. However, due to the high complexity of the process, in particular of the interaction system/process/product, the above goals have only partially been achieved today, to a limited, unsatisfactory extent. The here presented research addresses the above needs and their progress by developing and starting to implement and study a highly sophisticated sensor and analysis platform for machining with the objectives of (i) advanced measurement and analysis of the milling process and (ii) advanced process monitoring and control. For a certain highly advanced high speed machining centre a comprehensive concept has been developed for the integration different kinds of sensors to the system. In particular the complex concept takes into account sophisticated analysis, research and development through the cooperation between different experimental and theoretical methods. The present thesis presents the developed platform concept. Due to the complexity of this sensor and analysis platform and its early stage of development, the here presented research work focuses on the implementation and investigation of selected sensors and analysis methods. Paper I screens and discusses the possibilities of the applied machining centre for sensor integration, particularly aiming at process monitoring. From the large variety of relevant sensors, particularly promising turned out to be acoustic emission sensors, force sensors, accelerometers, temperature sensors and optical sensors. Their potential and limitations are discussed. The specific concept developed for the addressed high speed machining centre is described in Paper II. Force <b>sensors</b> measuring the <b>spindle</b> force components, flexible accelerometers measuring the vibrations at almost any desired spindle or product location and Laser Doppler Vibrometry (LDV) for non-contact measurement of vibrations {{turned out to be the}} most promising sensors, to be implemented and studied in more detail in the following. Moreover, the concept recommends the cooperation of the sensors with modelling, simulation and analysis at different levels. Experimentally, the simulation of a static load to the spindle or even oscillating load through a magnetic shaker was realised in order to simulate the processing conditions for measuring and characterizing the spindle behaviour. The LDV- measurement enables precise identification of spindle oscillations at different locations. A particular challenge is the identification of stable operating points at high rotational speeds through stability lobes. For this purpose the vibrations of a certain complex, thin walled aerospace structure were measured by LDV and in good agreement simulated by FEA for different machining process stages in order to derive stable lobe areas. Beside implementation and first testing of the above mentioned methods, the paper describes and discusses possible concepts for a closed loop control of the process. In Paper III the LDV method is for the first time and successfully applied for measuring the fee-running rotating spindle of a high speed machining centre. In particular the roundness of the dummy tool applied was measured at high accuracy during rotation, as verified by mechanical measurement. Moreover, the LDV permits the measurement of misalignment of other geometrical and kinematical imperfections of the spindle rotation. Paper IV describes in more detail the verification of FEA through LDV for the complex aerospace structure, presented in Paper II. Both, vibrations of the unconstrained and of the clamped workpiece are studied. Moreover, the workpiece vibration characteristics was studied at four different machining stages, starting from aluminium stock and ending in a thin walled structure after removal of 97 % of the material. In particular the corresponding stability lobes were predicted by the aid of the FEA, compared with modal analysis and with selected milling experiments. When machining a monolithic structure that reduces it's volume to such an extent gives several problem: Clamping of a thin walled structure is hard due to its flexibility, The changing dynamics of the workpiece has the affect that prediction of the vibrational properties is very hard to realise and finally the milling is hard because of the fact that the walls of the structure bends when a force is applied from the milling tool. Paper V discusses the suitability of different sensors for process monitoring, by applying them on-line during machining experiments for steel and aluminium, each at three different feed rates. The signals of force sensors in three dimensions arranged below the workpiece, of accelerometers in two directions mounted at the spindle housings and of LDV spotting the tool fixture ring were acquired on-line. The six signals were analysed, extracting mean values that were compared to the achieved surface roughness for the six different milling conditions. From evaluation of the stability of the signal and its coherence with the surface roughness trends the suitability of each sensor was discussed. While the sensors lateral and vertical to the feeding direction were not suitable, the sensors measuring in feeding direction were most promising, in particular the accelerometer and the corresponding LDV. The context between the roughness, process and sensor signals is discussed. Summarizing, a sophisticated sensor and analysis platform concept was developed. Selective sensors and methods have been implemented and studied with the purpose of system characterization, process understanding and process monitoring. The promising results encourage for continuation of this research programme. Godkänd; 2006; 20070109 (haneit...|$|R
