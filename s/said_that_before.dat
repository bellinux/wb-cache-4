25|$|Monmouth was {{beheaded}} by Jack Ketch on 15 July 1685, on Tower Hill.

It is <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>before</b> laying {{his head to the}} block Monmouth specifically bade Ketch finish him at one blow, saying he had mauled others before. Disconcerted, Ketch did indeed inflict multiple blows with his axe, the prisoner rising up reproachfully the while – a ghastly sight that shocked the witnesses, drawing forth execrations and groans. Some say a knife was at last employed to sever the head from the twitching body. Sources vary; some claim eight blows, the official Tower of London fact sheet says it took five blows, while Charles Spencer, in his book Blenheim, puts it at seven.|$|E

500|$|The {{first series}} was {{therefore}} the first BBC radio comedy to use stereophonic techniques.

The production had one eight track tape recorder at their disposal {{and so many of}} the effects in the programme were mixed [...] "live" [...] with tape loops of background sound effects strung around the recording studio. Actors whose speech needed to be modified in post-production by Radiophonic technicians, such as Stephen Moore's performance as Marvin the Android, were recorded in isolation from the main [...] "humanoid" [...] characters.
