5|$|One of the {{activities}} that became synonymous with Belle Vue was <b>speedway</b> (known {{at the time as}} dirt track racing), which was introduced on 28 July 1928 in the recently built greyhound racing arena. The sport proved to be very popular, and the decision was taken to convert the 1887 athletics ground into a <b>speedway</b> stadium, which opened on 23 March 1929. It was at the time the largest purpose-built <b>speedway</b> stadium in the country, possibly in the world. Eventually it became the first home of the Belle Vue Aces, but it was also used for many other events, such as football, cricket, rugby league (Belle Vue Rangers), baseball, stock car racing and tennis. The stadium had covered accommodation for 40,000spectators. As the <b>speedway</b> bikes ran on wood alcohol (known as dope), they were unaffected by fuel rationing during the Second World War and racing was able to continue, although many other attractions in the gardens were forced to close.|$|E
