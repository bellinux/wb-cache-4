Experimental results obtained on samples before ageing and after accelerated thermal and electrical ageing are presented.

50|$|The {{concrete}} lining {{surrounding the}} disposal site will slowly increase its permeability over time due to degradation. This presents {{the possibility of a}} radionuclide leak into the groundwater <b>system.</b> <b>Degradation</b> occurs in part due to attack by sulfates, corrosion and expansion of steel reinforcements, leaching and loss of calcium, and other various chemical interactions caused by interaction with the water table. Dissolution by sulfate attack is estimated to be 1.03*10^-3 cm/yr, which has been determined to be negligible. Leaching of calcium hydroxide is calculated to be 2*10^-3 cm/yr, also determined to be insignificant. However, attack by chlorides on the steel has determined to be 4.3*10^-2 cm/year, resulting in complete degradation after 1400 years; these values are hardly negligible and represent warnings of the possibility of leaching of radionuclides due to a weakened barrier.|$|E
50|$|All {{that remains}} to {{calculate}} the LCOE is the expected production. Modules are generally warranted for 25 years and suffer only minor degradation during that time, so {{all that is needed}} to predict the generation is the local insolation. According to PVWatts a one-kilowatt system in Matsumoto, Nagano will produce 1187 kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity a year. Over a 25-year lifetime, the system will produce about 29,675 kWh (not accounting for the small effects of <b>system</b> <b>degradation,</b> about 0.25% a year). If this system costs $5,000 to install ($5 per watt), very conservative compared to worldwide prices, the LCOE = 5,000/29,675 ~= 17 cents per kWh. This is lower than the average Japanese residential rate of ~19.5 cents, which means that, in this simple case which skips the necessary time value of money calculation, PV has reached grid parity for residential users in Japan.|$|E

As the dye solutions are sensitive towards γ–irradiation, decolouration occurs on irradiation. The G–values for the doses in between the range of 0. 035 kGy to 0. 125 kGy were found to be practically constant for pure aqueous systems.

40|$|In multi-camera {{tracking}} systems, camera placement {{can have}} a significant impact on the overall performance. In feature-based motion capture <b>systems,</b> <b>degradation</b> can come from two major sources, low image resolution and target occlusion. In order to achieve better tracking and automate the camera placement process, a quantitative metric to evaluate the quality of multi-camera configurations is needed. We propose a quality metric that estimates the error caused by both image resolution and occlusion [...] It includes a probabilistic occlusion model that reflects the dynamic self-occlusion of the target. Using this metric, we show the impact of occlusion on optimal camera pose by analyzing several camera configurations. Finally, we show camera placement examples that demonstrate how this metric can be applied toward the automatic design of more accurate and robust tracking systems. ...|$|R

By this time open sores will develop on the upper torso. Some will be the size of dimes, others will be large enough to stick a couple fingers into. They will crust up, causing cohesion to any fabric the sores touch, which is extremely painful to remove.

Recurrent AF is extremely rare. Bone lesions typically resolve with treatment, but residual radiographic changes, such as sclerosis and hyperostosis, may remain.

With such software it is possible to demonstrate the possibilities of so called energy aware systems. During the project two scenarios were investigated and implemented, one is a simple state-based monitor. This monitor application can observe and visualize the effects of power management on a computer system. It shows that by utilizing <b>system</b> <b>degradation,</b> the lifetime of a system can be prolonged. The other scenario consists of a prototype for a firefighter coordinator application. It allows a rescue leader to observe firefighters at an emergency scene. This application can interact with the power management, by requesting a desired life time of a hand-held device carried by the firefighter. This shows that these techniques can be utilized without knowledge of the underlying power management software...|$|E

In some cases, diagnostics system could not catch the starting of <b>system</b> <b>degradation,</b> because the degradation phenomenon could not be monitored. This happens when the degradation is due to internal system wears and tears and it is too difficult to have direct sensor readings of its deviation from normal values. In this case, using AI techniques to learn the relation between monitored parameters and system health is the best solution. Many tools from the data mining community can be used to discover the hidden relationships between the monitored parameters to explain the strange behavior of <b>system</b> <b>degradation.</b>|$|E

Characterized in details has been the juvenile hormone <b>degradation</b> <b>system</b> of the D. melanogaster. For the first time, the reaction of the juvenile hormone <b>degradation</b> <b>system</b> of the this species on stressing effect has been studied. It has been established, that the females respond to the stressor action by the decrease of activity of the juvenile hormone-esterase and juvenile hormone-epoxydhydrase. The similar reaction of the males is absent. For the first time, the analysis of the juvenile hormone-esterase (JHE) activity genetic control of the D. melanogaster has been performed. It has been detected, that the activity of the ferment in the norm and with stress is being controlled by the different genes. The gene, controlling the juvenile hormone-esterase activity under the normal conditions, is realized in chromosome 2. The tissue expression of the JHE gene of the D. melanogaster has been studied. For the first time, it has been shown, that the gene is being expressed in the ovuries.
