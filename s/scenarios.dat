5|$|In Rewrite Harvest festa!, {{there are}} six {{separate}} <b>scenarios,</b> one for each heroine. The player is initially given the choice to play the <b>scenarios</b> for Kotori, Chihaya and Lucia from a character selection screen. Once these three <b>scenarios</b> are completed, the routes for Sizuru and Akane become available, and after those two are completed, Kagari's scenario is made available. After the completion of Kagari's scenario, a dungeon exploration role-playing minigame called Rewrite Quest becomes available.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{announcement}} of the game on January 4, 2005, a trial version was released on September 7, 2005. This contained a cut-down version of the game, introducing new features, such as two campaign <b>scenarios,</b> two random map <b>scenarios</b> (New England and Texas) and access to two civilizations (British and Spanish), and a variety of modifications. An updated demo version was made available with the game's release on September 22, 2005.|$|E
30|$|The {{impact on}} the {{percentage}} of new pensions that are limited by the upper cap varies from <b>scenario</b> to <b>scenario,</b> as shown in Fig. 4. The effects start to be evident in 2036 in <b>scenario</b> 2 [or <b>scenario</b> (1, 0.5)], in 2031 in <b>scenario</b> 3 [or <b>scenario</b> (1, 0.3)], and in 2021 in <b>scenario</b> 4 or extreme <b>scenario.</b> In Fig. 4, we show the projected trend of percentage of pensioners affected in the coming decades. By 2051, 51 % of new pensions would be capped in <b>scenario</b> 2, while in the most extreme <b>scenario</b> this proportion rises to 75 %. In this case, <b>scenario</b> 4, the effects would begin in 2021 {{and the percentage of}} capped pensions would rise over time exceeding 70 % by 2051 and reaching 100 % in 2071.|$|R
30|$|As {{the market}} {{competition}} increases, the equilibrium price and producers’ total profit decreased, while the total trading volume, consumers’ surplus {{and social welfare}} increased. The total social welfare increased by 10.2, 10.9 and 12.0 % in <b>Scenario</b> 2, <b>Scenario</b> 3 and <b>Scenario</b> 4, respectively, compared with <b>Scenario</b> 1. Therefore, a single policy (in <b>Scenario</b> 2 and <b>Scenario</b> 3) is Pareto improving compared with the complete monopoly <b>scenario</b> (<b>Scenario</b> 1), and the combined policies (<b>Scenario</b> 4) is Pareto improving compared with a single policy <b>scenario.</b> From the aspect of total social welfare, combined policies will make a better market equilibrium, because {{as the number of}} market participants increases, the market power of each company is undermined and consumers’ market power is enhanced.|$|R

5|$|For {{work on the}} scenario, Jun Maeda contributed {{along with}} {{composing}} some of the game's music. Further writers include Leo Kashida who had worked on , and two new scenario writers to Key—Yūto Tonokawa, and Chika Shirokiri. Maeda wrote the <b>scenarios</b> for Rin and the entire male cast; Kashida wrote the scenario for Mio; Tonokawa wrote the <b>scenarios</b> for Komari and Yuiko; finally, Shirokiri wrote the <b>scenarios</b> for Haruka and Kudryavka. In an interview of Maeda and Tonokawa in the August 2007 issue of Push!!, {{it was reported that}} the story of Little Busters! is twice as long as Air's, but only half as long as Clannad's. However, this {{does not take into account}} the minigames in Little Busters! which serve to lengthen the game. The music in the game, not counting Maeda's, was composed by Key's signature composers Shinji Orito and Magome Togoshi, in addition to Manack and members of PMMK. Togoshi left Key in October 2006 before the visual novel went on sale.|$|E

The interface allows the Storyteller to create or modify <b>scenarios</b> by placing items, monsters, and characters across the map. Character statistics, such as experience points, abilities, and disciplines, can also be modified. Finally, the Storyteller can assume the role of any character at any given time. These functions allow the Storyteller to dynamically manipulate the play environment while the other players traverse it.|$|E

5|$|The game {{is divided}} into three {{separate}} <b>scenarios,</b> with each one surrounding the story of the three main characters: Terra, Aqua and Ventus. While the first ten minutes of the story are the same regardless of which character is chosen, the events that follow differ in each scenario, with each character's narrative occurring parallel to the others. The gameplay of each scenario differs based on the abilities of each character such as their power, speed and magic: Terra is the most powerful in terms of physical damage, Ventus is the fastest character and Aqua specializes in magic. Players may choose which of the three <b>scenarios</b> they wish to start with near the beginning of the game. The recommended scenario order of play by Nomura is Terra, followed by Ventus, and lastly Aqua, allowing the player to best understand the story. Completing all three <b>scenarios</b> will unlock the story's final chapter.|$|E

5|$|The {{creation}} of user-made <b>scenarios</b> or series of <b>scenarios</b> (campaigns) {{for the game}} was made possible using the Scenario Builder. This tool is simpler and easier to learn than comparable editors used in more modern games, but it has fewer capabilities as a result. Ensemble Studios used the Scenario Builder to make the single-player campaigns which shipped with the retail game. Various unofficial sites exist where custom <b>scenarios</b> can be submitted and downloaded. In late 2005, {{it was discovered that}} by modifying various data files, units present in the beta versions of the game could be made available in the editor. Some obscure units include a spaceship and a hero that changes ownership when units move near it. Through data editing, the rules of unit placement can also be modified. This allows units to be placed on any terrain and on top of other units, which creates new possibilities for design. Other significant discoveries include new terrain templates, a mode to triple each unit's hitpoints and a tool to edit map sizes.|$|E

Likewise, the game's character designs were split amongst four artists. Misato Mitsumi provided the character designs and illustrations for Konomi and Yuma; Hisashi Kawata for Lucy and Karin; Tatsuki Amazuyu for Tamaki and Manaka; and Takeshi Nakamura for Sango, Ruri, and Yūki. The game's music was composed by Shimokawa, Junya Matsuoka, Shinya Ishikawa, Kazue Nakagami, and Michio Kinugasa.|$|E

The BC plans should reflect the requirements to recover the business in the widest possible damage. The risk assessment should cater to developing impact <b>scenarios</b> that are applicable to the business or the premises it operates. For example, it might not be logical to consider tsunami in the region of Mideast since the likelihood of such a threat is negligible.|$|E

30|$|Furthermore, <b>scenario</b> {{traceability}} {{is understood}} as a subjective category depending on the access to information about ‘ingredients’ and their ‘mixing’ (e.g., by internals vs. externals). In addition, perceived traceability might also {{be influenced by the}} method expertise and the individual background knowledge of a <b>scenario’s</b> user, as well as the effort (s)he invests into tracing a <b>scenario</b> construction process. Particularly in combined <b>scenario</b> processes, <b>scenario</b> traceability is assumed to be an issue for internal users too: In integrated <b>scenario</b> processes, scenario-groups, modelers and scenario-experts are, depending on the design of actor inclusion, internals to some of the <b>scenario</b> construction activities—but external to others. Therefore, this definition distinguishes between internal <b>scenario</b> traceability, i.e., traceability for internal actors of the entire process, 19 and external <b>scenario</b> traceability, i.e., traceability for completely external actors, i.e., actors that have not participated during any of the <b>scenario</b> construction activities. 20 Furthermore, it distinguishes between the perceptions of users that are (method) experts (e.g., modeling experts, <b>scenario</b> experts) and those that are rather lay persons with respect to the methods used. In this sense, an internal qualitative <b>scenario</b> expert might be a lay person with respect to the numerical model, for example.|$|R
