As the composites {{were subjected to}} multiple uniaxial tensile load/unload cycles up to applied stresses of 1650 MPa, load transfer from the matrix to the <b>stiffer</b> <b>particles</b> was observed. At low applied loads, where the particles are elastic, agreement with Eshelby elastic predictions for stress partitioning between matrix and particles is found, indicating good bonding between the phases. At high applied loads, departure from the elastic stress partitioning is observed when the particles reach the von Mises yield criterion, as expected when plasticity occurs in the particles. Multiple mechanical excursions in the particle plastic region lead to strain hardening in the particles, as well as evolution in the residual strain state of the unloaded composite. I...|$|E
40|$|The linear {{viscoelastic}} {{and steady}} shear flow properties of high phase volume suspensions {{of a range}} of agar microgel particles have been measured and are found to depend upon the deformability (or modulus) of the particles. Agar concentrations in the range 0. 5 - 5 wt % are utilized, giving a range of particle modulus spanning 2. 4 - 185 kPa. On increasing the particle modulus, in suspensions with phase volumes above maximum packing, the storage modulus increases by two orders of magnitude although the loss tangent (tan delta) also increases due to increasing viscous dissipation. The flow properties of the suspensions at high shear stresses also showed significant differences due to changing particle rigidity. The suspensions containing the hardest particles are found to display limited evidence of shear-thickening behavior at high stresses, while those containing the softest particles continue to shear thin. A high-shear plateau in the viscosity is observed for suspensions with particles of medium rigidity. The suspensions containing the <b>stiffer</b> <b>particles</b> also have a considerably higher viscosity for the same degree of space filling. Empirical expressions linking the viscoelastic and flow properties to the particle modulus have been derived. (C) 2004 The Society of Rheology...|$|E
40|$|Using {{experiments}} and simulations, we study {{the flow of}} soft particles through quasi-two-dimensional hoppers. The first experiment uses oil-in-water emulsion droplets in a thin sample chamber. Due to surfactants coating the droplets, they easily slide past each other, approximating soft frictionless disks. For these droplets, clogging at the hopper exit requires a narrow hopper opening only slightly larger than the droplet diameter. The second experiments use soft hydrogel particles in a thin sample chamber, where we vary gravity by changing the tilt angle of the chamber. For reduced gravity, clogging becomes easier, and can occur for larger hopper openings. Our simulations mimic the emulsion {{experiments and}} demonstrate that softness is a key factor controlling clogging: with <b>stiffer</b> <b>particles</b> or a weaker gravitational force, clogging is easier. The fractional amount a single particle is deformed under its own weight is a useful parameter measuring particle softness. Data from the simulation and hydrogel experiments collapse when compared using this parameter. Our results suggest that prior studies using hard particles were in a limit where the role of softness is negligible which causes clogging to occur with significantly larger openings.

40|$|The work {{presented}} {{is based}} on an imaging method using dual-frequency band pulses for imaging of nonlinear scatters from <b>stiff</b> <b>particles</b> like micro calcifications. The pulse complex consist of a high-frequency imaging pulse and a low-frequency manipulation pulse which overlap in time. The frequency ratio between the two pulses is in the range of 10 : 1. This technique has already demonstrated to perform well while imaging resonant nonlinear scatters from such as micro bubbles. However, imaging of lower intensity nonlinear scatters from <b>stiff</b> <b>particles</b> has not yet been achieved. It can be shown that the magnitude and the polarity of the nonlinear scatters follows the magnitude and the polarity of the low-frequency pulse. Imaging of <b>stiff</b> <b>particles</b> requires higher manipulation pressure, but the manipulation pressure does not change the scattering only. The co-propagating high frequency pulse observes a non homogeneous low frequency pressure and becomes distorted. This distortion of the high frequency pulse masks the nonlinear scattering, and to achieve sufficient suppression of the linear scattering the distortion must be corrected for. In this thesis two agar based phantoms have been made. In both phantoms reverberation layer(s) of plastic was mounted. Steel wires with diameters 0. 5 mm, 0. 3 mm were positioned below the plastic layer(s) together with calcium particles of bead size 190 micrometer. Images of both phantoms have been compared using conventional B-mode imaging and the presented method. In the first phantom, Phantom A, the SNR for two steel wires and a calcium particle were increased by 8 - 9 dB while class 3 reverberations were suppressed down to the backscatter noise level. Similarly for the second phantom, Phantom B, class 1, 2 reverberations were suppressed and the SNR for two steel wires were increased by 11 - 12 dB. </p...|$|R

The two components of the binary mixture have unequal membrane rigidities. The problem is studied numerically using an accelerated implementation of the boundary integral method. The effect {{of a variety of}} parameters was investigated, including the capillary number, rigidity ratio between the two species, volume fraction, confinement ratio, and the number fraction of the more floppy particle $X_f$ in the mixture. It was observed that in suspensions of pure species, the mean wall normal positions of the stiff and the floppy particles are comparable. In mixtures, however, the <b>stiff</b> <b>particles</b> were found to be increasingly displaced towards the walls with increasing $X_f$, while the floppy particles were found to increasingly accumulate near the centerline with decreasing $X_f$. The origins of this segregation is traced to the effect of the number fraction $X_f$ on the localization of the stiff and the floppy particles in the near wall region [...] the probability of escape of a <b>stiff</b> <b>particle</b> from the near wall region to the interior is greatly reduced with increasing $X_f$, while the exact opposite trend is observed for a floppy particle with decreasing $X_f$. Simple model studies on heterogeneous pair collisions involving a stiff and a floppy particle mechanistically explain this observation. The key result in these studies is that the <b>stiff</b> <b>particle</b> experiences much larger cross-stream displacement in heterogeneous collisions than the floppy particle. A unified mechanism incorporating the wall-induced migration of deformable particles and the particle fluxes associated with heterogeneous and homogeneous pair collisions is presented.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to predict the thermomechanical behavior of 2080 aluminum alloy reinforced with SiC particles using the Mori–Tanaka theory combined with the finite element method. The influences of particle volume fraction, stiffness, aspect ratio and orientation were examined in terms of effective Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio and coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the composite. The microstructure induced local stress and strain field was obtained through the numerical models of the representative volume element. Results suggested that particle volume fraction had significant impact on the effective Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio and CTE of the composite. <b>Stiffer</b> <b>particles</b> could improve the effective Young’s modulus of the composite, while the overall sensitivity of the effective Poisson’s ratio and CTE with respect to the particle stiffness was minimal. Particles with larger aspect ratio generally led to a composite with increased effective Young’s modulus, as well as reduced Poisson’s ratio and CTE. The overall material properties of the composite were insensitive to the particle aspect ratio beyond 10. The particle orientations significantly impacted the effective material properties of the composite, especially along the longitudinal direction. Random 3 D dispersed particles exhibited the effective isotropic behavior, whereas anisotropy has been observed for random 2 D and unidirectional aligned particles.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study of}} wave propagation in fluid saturated granular materials is presented. Because of their microstructure, granular materials are multi-phase, composed of solid particles along with pore fluid and/or gas. The mechanical response of such materials is quite complicated {{and difficult to}} model with classical continuum mechanics. Due to the microscopic heterogeneity of the particulate media, wave propagation in porous or granular materials is governed y complex physical behaviors which are sensitive to slight variations in fluid content or of the solid microstructure. The numerical routine used to stimulate the wave propagation processes was the discrete element method (DEM). Idealized particulate assemblies are used to model real granular materials. The DEM method uses the simplifying assumption of Newtonian rigid-body dynamics to calculate the translational and rotational motion of each particle in these model assemblies. A new normal contact law governing particle interactions through a fluid was developed based on the theory of elastohydrodynamics. Tangential interactions were accounted for by using a simple shearing approximation and a Coulomb law. Using these new contact laws, simulations of one- and two-dimensional model assemblies were performed. Specific results for wave speed and amplitude attenuation are presented, and relationships are established between the microstructure or fabric of particulate materials and its macroscopic wave propagation behaviors. Results include the effects of particle size, wavelength, viscosity, interparticle gap spacing, etc. on dynamic load transfers in porous media. It was observed {{that the presence of}} pore fluid can have significant effects on the macroscopic dynamic behaviors of particulate materials by changing the contact response between adjacent particles through hydrodynamic squeeze-film action. Wave attenuation increases and wave velocity decreases with increasing interparticle gap spacing, and these effects are more pronounced at smaller inter particle gap spacing. It was found that there was a slight increase in wave velocity with increasing pore fluid viscosity. Wave velocity was found to be higher through assemblies of <b>stiffer</b> <b>particles.</b> It also can be concluded that wave propagational behaviors of particulate materials are directly related to the microstructure or fabric of them...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the influence of the particle size ratio on texture and force transmission in two-dimensional cohesionless binary granular composties by using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Four numerical composite samples, which differ in terms of the particle size ratios, are used in this study. The samples are composed of two constitutive materials with a stiffness ratio of four between the higher one termed as <b>stiff</b> <b>particle</b> and another termed as soft particle. The samples are subjected to an uniaxial confined vertical compression on the upper wall. The results under static conditions show that the particle size ratio mainly affects the contact sub-networks. The coordination number decreases when the particle size ratios (Dstiff/Dsoft = 1. 2 − 3. 0) increase, contrary to stiff-any case. Considering the spatial arrangement of contact directions, contacts between <b>stiff</b> <b>particles</b> exhibit an anisotropic distribution. On the contrary, the other contacts, i. e. soft-soft and stiff-soft contacts play a role to support the granular system in equilibrium. It is interesting to note that for all the particle size ratios, an exponential distribution and power-law are observed for the strong and weak network, respectively. Furthermore, almost 60 % of the entire contacts transmit the weak forces...|$|R

In this presentation we discuss, in particular, one major source of macro-scale model error for given mesostructural morphology and constitutive models of the meso-constituents: The size, or degree of "representativeness", of the RVE.

Characterization is carried out by dynamic light scattering, quartz crystal microbalance, field emission scanning electron microscopy, tensile tests and dynamic mechanical analysis. The nanostructured biocomposite was produced in volume fractions of 0, 8, 22 and 56 % chitin nanofibers. Favorable chitin-chitosan synergy for colloidal dispersion is demonstrated. Also, lowered moisture sorption is observed for the composites, probably due to the favorable chitin-chitosan interface.

Both particle elasticity and friction at the contact level are treated implicitly and simultaneously, and the contact algorithm is cast into a mathematical programming-based contact dynamics framework. The framework provides the advantages of implicit time integrators (for e. g., stability and larger time steps) and ability to handle both rigid and highly <b>stiff</b> <b>particles.</b> By allowing for particle non-convexity, modeling flexibility is significantly enhanced, to a level that is comparable with isogeometric methods.

The effect of <b>stiff</b> <b>particles</b> in the film are studied for systems where the film is under residual tensile stresses. The particles, when they are fully bonded to the matrix, increase the stiffness of the composite film. In cases where the particles debond from the matrix material, the stiffness of the composite film decreases. The conditions under which the debonding process is stable are studied. For systems properly designed, a controlled debonding process of the particles can thus be used to reduce the stress levels in composite film lowering the risk for delamination of the composite film from the substrate {{as well as the}} risk of through cracks in the film. The work includes finite element based unit cell calculations of interface debonding between spherical particles and the film, and the release of residual stresses following this.

The suspension forming bacteria may be considered as system of living active ultrafine particles (size 1 μm). Present investigation addresses to the simulation of the S. aureus bacterium-surface interactions in a framework of the Discrete Element Method (DEM). Bacterium is of the spherical shape, while the glass surface is flat and considered as elastic. In this work the theoretical model for bacteria is similar to that used for the ultrafine size <b>stiff</b> <b>particles.</b> We investigate the behaviour of the active particle by applying two known Derjaguin, Müller, Toporov (DMT) [1] and Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey, Overbeek (DLVO) [2, 3] models, which are used for simulation of ultrafine size objects. These models are enhanced by applying suggested dissipation mechanism related to the adhesion. It was assumed that energy can be dissipated and the force-displacement hysteresis can occur through the adhesion effect, where an amount of dissipated energy is fixed and independent on initial kinetic energy. This force-displacement hysteresis was observed at the physical experiments with bacteria provided by the means of the atomic force microscopy (AFM), Ubbink and Schär-Zammaretti (2007) [4]. It was illustrated that the presented adhesive-dissipative model, which applies DEM, offers the opportunity to capture dissipation effect during the contact.

Furthermore, it was demonstrated that specimen thickness has, in comparison to the influence of particle size, a small influence on permeability increase due to microcracking...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{behavior of}} polymer blends containing 80 wt% of HDPE and 20 wt% of TPS and compatibilized with HDPE-g-MA grafted copolymer was investigated. Unmodified HDPE/TPS blends exhibit high fracture resistance, however, the interfacial modification of those blends by addition of HDPE-g-MA {{leads to a}} dramatic drop in fracture resistance. The compatibilization of HDPE/TPS blends increases the surface area of TPS particles by decreasing their size. It was postulated that the addition of HDPE-g-MA induces a reaction between maleic anhydride and hydroxyl groups of the glycerol leading to a decrease of the glycerol content in the TPS phase. This phenomenon increases the stiffness of the modified TPS <b>particles</b> and <b>stiffer</b> TPS <b>particles</b> leading to an important reduction in toughness and plastic deformation, {{as measured by the}} EWF method. It is shown that the main toughening mechanism in HDPE/TPS blends is shear-yielding. This article demonstrates that stiff, low diameter TPS particles reduce shear band formation and consequently decrease the resistance to crack propagation.

40|$|Abstract Superelastic NiTi and NiTi-TiC {{composites}} {{were subjected}} to static uniaxial compressive loading while neutron diffraction spectra were simultaneously acquired. A methodology was established to obtain quantitative strain, texture and phase volume fraction information during the forward and reverse stress-induced martensitic transformation. Despite the presence of 10 vol. % of <b>stiff</b> TiC <b>particles,</b> a macroscopic compressive strain of 3 % was obtained in the composite on loading and was fully recovered on unloading. The observed behavior suggests that the martensite accommodates the mismatch with the transforming austenite (while they co-exist) and the TiC particles (in {{the case of the}} composite). Superelastic NiTi was also subjected to simultaneous neutron diffraction and uniaxial compressive cycling. The average phase strain in the mechanically-loaded austenite (at a given stress) remained unaltered during the load-unload cycles. However, differences in both volume fraction and texture of austenite and martensite were noted as cycling progressed, suggesting that these factors are responsible for the changes in the macroscopic stress-strain response of NiTi with mechanical cycling. 1...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{controlled}} assembly of nanostructured materials remains a major challenge, we often turn to biological systems for inspiration. For example, the lipid molecules found in cell membranes are amphiphilic, with oily hydrophobic tails and polar hydrophilic headgroups. In water, lipids self-assemble bilayer membranes a few nanometers thick, with the tails {{hidden from the}} water behind the heads [1]. Non-biological amphiphilic molecules such as block copolymers self-assemble artificial membranes by the same principle [2]. In their recent article [3], Barry and Dogic describe how to self-assemble monolayer membranes in solution {{in a way that}} relies on the geometry of the constituents, rather than the amphiphilic property. Again, biology plays a crucial role: the membranes are composed of fd viruses, <b>stiff</b> rod-like <b>particles</b> ≈ 880 nm in length and ≈ 7 nm in diameter. t= 0 ms t= 60 ms Figure 1 : Left panel: DIC micrograph (above) and schematic (below) of disks formed from self-assembled fd virus particles.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose a {{continuum}} micromechanics model for the simulation of uniaxial compressive and tensile tests on lime-based mortars, in order to predict their stiffness, compressive and tensile strengths, and tensile fracture energy. In tension, we adopt an incremental strain-controlled form of the Mori-Tanaka scheme with a damageable matrix phase, while a simple $J_ 2 $ yield criterion is employed in compression. To reproduce the behavior of lime-based mortars correctly, the scheme must take into account shrinkage cracking among aggregates. This phenomenon is introduced into the model via penny-shaped cracks, whose density is estimated on the basis of a particle size distribution combined with the results of finite element analyses of a single crack formation between two spherical inclusions. Our predictions show a good agreement with experimental data and explain the advantages of compliant crushed brick fragments, often encountered in ancient mortars, over <b>stiff</b> sand <b>particles.</b> The validated model provides a reliable tool for optimizing the composition of modern lime-based mortars with applications in conservation and restoration of architectural heritage.

40|$|Previous work by {{the authors}} [1 - 3] on rapid {{prototyping}} composite (gypsum/epoxy) was done {{with respect to the}} experimental characterization of mechanical properties and morphology study. This current paper deals with development of numerical homogenization models, capable to predict mechanical properties of gypsum composite as well as other similar materials with unconnected <b>stiff</b> inclusions (<b>particles)</b> and considerable amount of voids. Large number of elements was needed to build up 3 D representative unit cell (RUC) with realistic particle and void size and shape distributions. Due to numerical complexity, parallel calculations were carried out with the in-house developed FEM code. This code was verified by cross-comparison of some of results with commercial FEM package ANSYS. The detailed digital model of gypsum/epoxy composite, containing accurate gypsum particle and void distribution was employed as RUC. The SEM micrograph of material along with example of 3 D model used in calculations are shown in Fig. 1. The results of numerical modeling were compared with experimental results and predictions of simpler micro-mechanical models. Numerical modeling was also used to perform comprehensive parametric analysis with respect to mechanical properties of composite...|$|R
40|$|Our {{statistical}} thermodynamics model of solution of <b>stiff,</b> platelike, biaxial <b>particles</b> interacting solely via repulsion on contact (athermal limit) [Phys. Rev. E 62, 5011 (2000) ] is extended to incorporate dispersion {{interactions between the}} particles. Dispersion forces between anisotropic particles are accounted for using the Imura-Okano approach. Numerical calculations specialized to solutions of either rods or disks show that besides the isotropic-nematic biphasic coexistence range, inclusion of attractive forces resulted in the appearance of nematic-nematic coexistence in both, disks and rods, solutions. The critical divergence {{of the difference between}} the order parameters and concentrations of the two nematics is observed while approaching the critical temperature. The minimum aspect ratio of rods or disks for the formation of the nematic phase is also discussed...|$|R
