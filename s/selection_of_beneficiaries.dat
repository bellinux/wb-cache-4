Scheduled Areas are areas identified by the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution of India. Scheduled Areas are found in ten states of India which have predominant population of tribal communities. The Scheduled Areas, were not covered by the 73rd Constitutional Amendment or Panchayati Raj Act of the Indian Constitution as provided in the Part IX of the Constitution. PESA was enacted on 24 December 1996 to extend the provisions of Part IX of the Constitution to Scheduled Areas, with certain exceptions and modifications. PESA sought to enable the Panchayats at appropriate levels and Gram Sabhas to implement a system of self-governance with respect to a number of issues such as customary resources, minor forest produce, minor minerals, minor water bodies, <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>beneficiaries,</b> sanction of projects, and control over local institutions. PESA is an Act to provide for the extension of the provisions of Part IX of the Constitution relating to the Panchayats and the Scheduled Areas. PESA was viewed as a positive development for tribal communities in Scheduled Areas who had earlier suffered tremendously from engagement with modern development processes and from the operation of both colonial laws and statutes made in independent India. The loss of access to forest, land, and other community resources had increased their vulnerability. Rampant land acquisition and displacement due to development projects had led to large scale distress in tribal communities living in Scheduled Areas. PESA was seen as a panacea for many of these vulnerabilities and sought to introduce a new paradigm of development where the tribal communities in such Scheduled Areas were to decide by themselves the pace and priorities of their development.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this report is to conduct a re-evaluation of the targeting methods used by PROGRESA {{in light of the}} revisions adopted by the PROGRESA administration regarding how households are selected as eligible for PROGRESA benefits. Soon after completion of the report by Skoufias, Davis and Behrman in June 1999 we were informed that PROGRESA had added new households to the list <b>of</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> through a process called densification since it was felt that the original selection method was biased against the elderly poor who no longer lived with their children. As a result of the “densification” process the percent of households classified as eligible for program benefits increased from 52 % of the sample to 78 % of the sample. Given this large expansion in the number of eligible households it was felt that it is imperative to re-evaluate the targeting methods used by PROGRESA by adopting the same approach and methods used in the June 1999 report. Under the circumstances the June 1999 report should be considered as more relevant for providing detailed information about the methods used to evaluate PROGRESA’a targeting whereas this report should be considered as containing the definitive results of the evaluation of PROGRESA’s targeting methods. PROGRESA’s methodology consists of three stages: (1) the <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> localities; (2) the <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>beneficiary</b> households within selected localities, and (3) finalizing the list <b>of</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> after feedback from the community assemblies about families excluded or included incorrectly.

And third, do social assistance programmes benefit the chronically poor? The paper finds that by promoting longer-term human capital investment and protecting household assets and facilitating asset building, social transfers can directly or indirectly tackle persistent deprivation. The discussion notes that current knowledge on the outcomes of social transfers encourages strong expectations on its potential role in addressing long-term poverty, but that this can only be confirmed when current programmes reach maturity. This draws attention to the importance of extending the scope, depth and especially length of academic research into these relevant questions. ...|$|E

One of the priorities for the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development (MEMD) in the medium term is to increase access to modern energy services through rural electrification and renewable energy development. Among the key interventions for achieving this priority, is the Energy for Rural Transformation (ERT) programme. This programme is supporting the development of mini- hydro power plants and the provision of solar Photovoltaic panels among others. The overall goal of ERT with respect to health service provision is to improve delivery of health services in rural health centres through increased access to modern energy services and Information and Communications Technology (ICT).

Smaller farms have inclined towards non-farm income more than the medium and large farms. On the other hand, medium and large farms have diversified more than smaller farms with a departure from grain-based systems to vegetable-based farming systems. This asks for a holistic farm planning and extension intervention than confining efforts to technology transfer alone. India, along {{with a large number}} of countries having agrarian society, has entered the open economy regime and need to establish economic efficiency for their smallholder system (Birner et al.

The paper identifies four distinctive features of the programme that were revolutionary in their own right. First, the Progresa-Oportunidades embraced a multidimensional approach to poverty, linking income transfers with simultaneous interventions in health, education and nutrition. Second, the programme focused on the poor. This is in clear contrast to generalised food subsidies and other targeted interventions that dominated the antipoverty agenda in the past. Third, the programme followed a complex system of identification and <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> to prevent discretionary political manipulation of public funds. Finally, an independent impact evaluation protocol proved to be critical for both improving the programme’s effectiveness and strengthening its legitimacy across different political factions and constituencies. The paper concludes that the success of Progresa-Oportunidades must be understood in a broader context, where a harsh economic and political environment, coupled with a rapid democratisation and increasing political competition, laid down the foundations for the introduction and then sustained expansion of the programme...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the question of how donors select charitable beneficiaries, {{and the extent to which}} assessments of need are a factor in giving decisions. The study is based on interviews with 60 committed donors, representing a spread of gender, age and income levels. There is a widespread belief that charities exist primarily to help needy people and that the desire to meet needs is a key criterion in the <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> charitable <b>beneficiaries.</b> However, this study finds that people do not give to the most urgent needs, but rather they support causes that mean something to them. In particular, the study finds four non‑needs‑based criteria that commonly influence donors’ decision‑making: Donors’ tastes, preferences and passions, acquired ■■ as a result of an individual’s social experiences. These motivate many giving decisions, even among donors who perceive themselves to be motivated by meeting needs. ■■ Donors’ personal and professional backgrounds, which shape their ‘philanthropic autobiographies’ and influence their choice <b>of</b> <b>beneficiaries.</b> ■■ Donors’ perceptions of charity competence, notably the efficiency with which they are believed to use their money, often judged on the basis of the quality and quantity of direct mail. ■■ Donors’ desire to have a personal impact, such that their contribution makes a difference and is not ‘drowned out’ by other donors and government funding. Given the voluntary nature of charitable activity, these are not surprising conclusions. Giving and philanthropy have always been supply-led rather than demand-driven: the freedom to distribute as much as one wants, to whom one chooses, is what distinguishes giving from paying tax. Yet the methods used to encourage donations tend to assume that philanthropy depends on objective assessments of need rather than on donors’ enthusiasms. The tendency to overestimate the extent to which people act as rational agents results in fundraising literature that often focuses on the dimensions and urgency of the problem for which funding is sought. The assumption underlying this approach is that donations are distributed in relation to evidence of neediness, when in fact much giving could be described as ‘taste-based’ rather than ‘needs-based’...|$|R

40|$|The European Union has {{a common}} rural {{development}} policy, {{motivated by the}} fact that more than 90 % of the entire European territory can be classified as rural and 56 % of European citizens live in rural areas. Each Member State sets out a Rural Development Programme (RDP) focused on three main axes: economic development, environment protection and quality of life. Within the first axis, several measures are finalized to stimulate the investments for diversifying the agricultural activities; increasing the competitiveness of the businesses; improving the production and transformation processes and the commercialization towards a more sustainable direction. The measure 123 "Adding value to agricultural and forestry products" {{is one of the most}} important in terms of public resources spent. It aims at increasing the competitiveness of the agro-food industry and the value of products and it supports the investments in technological and organizational innovations in the transformation process. The policy is managed at regional level and every Italian Region is responsible for allocating the founds, selecting the enterprises that would benefit from the economic support and evaluating the impact of its financing. This paper presents the results of a research carried out to measure the impact of the 123 RDP measure in the Piedmont region, in Italy. The economic performances (ROI, ROE, ROA) of two different groups <b>of</b> firms ? <b>beneficiaries</b> and non-beneficiaries <b>of</b> the public support ? from the entire population of industrial agro-food enterprises of Piedmont, during the period 2005 - 2012, were compared. Despite the economic crises affected negatively all the firms analyzed in that period, those that benefited from the public funds showed better growth rates and profitability indexes. The authors propose different explanations for the results. From one hand, the RPD funds can be really determinant in sustaining the investments and improving the competitiveness of the firms involved in the programme. From the other hand, the beneficiaries are already the best performing firms of the territory and for this reason they are more competitive in the process of applying for the subsidy and <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> the <b>beneficiaries,</b> with a "picking the winners" effect.
