500|$|It was {{the first}} Final Fantasy title to be rated M for Mature by the Entertainment Software Rating Board for its North American release. For the western release, a collector's edition similar to that {{released}} in Japan was created, which included the card replicas and soundtrack selection. In addition, it included an English translation of the game's prequel manga, a steelbook holding the game disc and soundtrack selection featuring the logo and kanji artwork, and an 80-page artbook with a forward written by Tabata. The winners of a separate special <b>sweepstake</b> received a themed PS4 or Xbox One, along with promotional artwork posters specific to each console, a Play Arts Kai mini-figurine of Ace, and a gold Vermillion Bird pin.

500|$|Henry V {{built the}} first {{permanent}} fortifications of Portsmouth. In 1416, a number of French ships blockaded Portsmouth, which housed ships that were set to invade Normandy. Instead, Henry gathered a fleet at Southampton and invaded the Norman coast in August of that year. Recognising the town's growing importance, he ordered a wooden Round Tower to be built {{at the mouth of}} the harbour, which was completed in 1426. Henry VII rebuilt the fortifications with stone, assisted Robert Brygandine and Sir Reginald Bray in the construction of the world's first dry dock, and raised the Square Tower in 1494. During his reign, HenryVII made Portsmouth a Royal Dock, and was England's only dockyard to be considered [...] "national" [...] at the time.

500|$|After {{leaving the}} House of Commons, Bottomley denounced {{parliament}} {{in the pages}} of John Bull as a [...] "musty, rusty, corrupt system" [...] that urgently needed replacement. Through his newly formed Business League he addressed large crowds as he called for government run by businessmen not politicians. As always, Bottomley's lifestyle required fresh sources of income, and in 1912 John Bull began to organise competitions for cash prizes. Bottomley successfully sued the secretary of the Anti-Gambling League for suggesting that many of the prizewinners were John Bull nominees or employees, but received only a farthing in damages. These competitions helped to raise the magazine's circulation to 1.5million. In 1913 Bottomley met a Birmingham businessman, Reuben Bigland, and together they began running large-scale sweepstakes and lotteries, operated from Switzerland to circumvent English law. Again doubts arose about the genuineness of declared winners; the winner of the £25,000 <b>sweepstake</b> for the 1914 Derby proved on enquiry to be the sister-in-law of one of Bottomley's close associates. Bottomley insisted this was a coincidence; years later, it was revealed that all but £250 of the prize had been paid into a bank account controlled by Bottomley.|$|E
500|$|When Samuel White's widow, Anne, died in 1880, she bequeathed {{the estate}} to her late husband's nephew, John Thomas, 6th Baron Massy. The Massys were a Protestant Ascendancy family {{who had come}} to Ireland in 1641 and owned {{extensive}} lands in Counties Limerick, Leitrim and Tipperary. Massy used Killakee House to entertain guests while shooting game on nearby Cruagh and Glendoo mountains. He also used the house to host parties during major events on the Dublin social calendar such as the Dublin Horse Show, the Punchestown Races and the Dublin Castle Season. During these events long lines of guests' carriages could be seen stretched along the road leading to the house. However, as a result of declining rental income and poor investment decisions, John Thomas Massy was in considerable debt when he died in 1915. By the time John Massy's grandson, Hugh Hamon Charles, 8th Baron Massy, inherited the estate, the family's finances were in an irreversible decline and in 1924 he was declared bankrupt and evicted from Killakee House. The Massys initially moved into the Stewards House before taking up residence in Beehive Cottage, the estate's gate lodge, by agreement with the bank. Hamon Massy, unable to find a job on account of his alcoholism became dependent on his wife, Margaret, whose modest salary from a job with the Irish Hospitals' <b>Sweepstake</b> was the family's only income. In the years up to his death in 1958, Hamon Massy, who became known as the [...] "Penniless Peer", could be seen collecting firewood in the woods of his former family estate.|$|E

5000|$|Because {{of their}} {{potential}} for abuse, <b>sweepstakes</b> are heavily regulated in many countries. The U.S., Canada, and individual U.S. states all have laws covering <b>sweepstakes,</b> {{so that there are}} special rules depending on where the entrant lives. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission exercises some authority over <b>sweepstakes</b> promotion and <b>sweepstakes</b> scams in the United States. Notably, <b>sweepstakes</b> in Canada, Australia and several European countries require entrants to solve an (elementary school level) mathematical puzzle or answer a (fairly simple) knowledge question or solve a (trivial) fill-in-the-blanks guessing competition, making it (in theory at least) a contest of skill, in order to overcome requirements that would classify <b>sweepstakes</b> as a form of gambling under their country's legal definition.

2500|$|The inaugural two-mile Melbourne Cup on 7 November 1861 at Flemington was an eventful affair. Three of the {{seventeen}} starters fell {{during the}} race (two of them died); two jockeys sustained broken bones; one horse bolted off the course, but the race continued. At the final turn the favourite, Mormon, made his run but Archer caught and passed him. Before a crowd of about 4,000, Archer (a Sydney outsider, who was injured during training {{a few days before}} the race and attracted slight betting interest) defeated Mormon by six lengths in a time of 3:52.0– the slowest time in Melbourne Cup history. Archer also defeated Mormon at Randwick in May over 2½ miles in the Australia Plate. In the first Melbourne Cup Archer won for de Mestre his prize was the <b>sweepstake,</b> 710 gold sovereigns (1 sovereign = £1), and a trophy (a hand-beaten gold watch). Before the race Archer was dismissed by the bookies, but after de Mestre of Terara made his wager Archer’s odds shortened and he started as the 6-1 second favourite. The winning bets on Archer took money from Melbourne, [...] "refuelling interstate rivalry" [...] and adding to the excitement of the Cup. The next day, Archer won another two-mile race at Flemington (the Melbourne Town Plate) with the same time.|$|E
2500|$|Six {{weeks later}} (on 13 November 1862) Archer won his second Melbourne Cup {{carrying}} [...] – – at 2–1 odds {{in a time}} of 3:47.0. The race, held before a crowd of about 7,000 (nearly double the previous year's crowd), had 20 starters– the largest field of horses ever to start in Australia at that time. Again it was an exciting race; Cutts initially reined Archer back so that he was running last by several lengths, and appeared {{to be out of the}} running. He then gradually passed his opponents until reaching the leaders, when the long-striding horse galloped into first place. Archer won by eight lengths, with Mormon again running second. His winning margin is the Melbourne Cup record, unmatched until 1969 by Rain Lover. With a larger field meaning a larger <b>sweepstake,</b> Archer won 810 gold sovereigns and a trophy (a hand-beaten gold watch). Winning the Melbourne Cup two years in a row was a feat not repeated until Peter Pan won the race twice more than 70 years later. Two days later, Archer won the one-mile All-Aged Stakes at Flemington. Archer, Exeter and de Mestre arrived back in Sydney on the steamer Wonga Wonga on 29 November. The following week they caught another steamer to Wollongong, and traveled overland the 50 miles (80km) to Terara.|$|E
