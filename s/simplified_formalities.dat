30|$|Development of China's {{producer}} services {{demands a}} significant amount of capital. Given the continuous increase of the national wealth, financial investment should properly favor producer services and guide other social capital to invest in the service industry. Of course, investment of financial capital in producer services must meet the requirements of public finance and the market economy, follow the principle of ‘doing what is right, and refraining from doing what is wrong,’ give full play to the role of financial capital in ‘achieving the great with little,’ and focus on producer services in key areas, weak links, and areas with obvious externalities. Of course, it is not adequate to rely merely on government investment to develop the service industry, and we should gradually change the pattern of investment solely by government to investment by diversified sources including government, enterprises, individuals, and society. To this end, we should break the industry monopoly, lower the threshold, <b>simplify</b> <b>formalities,</b> and mobilize various social forces such as foreign capital and private capital to invest in producer services.|$|R

This service operated between Rio de Janeiro-Santos Dumont Airport and São Paulo-Congonhas and comprised regular hourly departures, common check-in counter, and <b>simplified</b> tickets and <b>formalities.</b> The service was an instant success. Transbrasil joined the partnership in 1968. Starting in 1975 the service was operated exclusively by Varig's Lockheed L-188 Electras. In 1999 this service came to an end because airlines decided to operate their own independent services.|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, as the {{increasingly}} intense {{international trade and}} logistics, the administrative burden of customs has been dramatically raised. In order to reduce repetitive taxing work and promote automatic administration, custom warehouses with electronic declaration systems are introduced and implemented by EU countries. The owner of custom warehouses can postpone the payment of import duties {{under the supervision of}} customs in case these goods are re-exported. The implementation of customwarehouses has significantly <b>simplified</b> custom <b>formality</b> and enhance administrative efficiency. However, its successful management highly depends on the accuracy and reliability of inventory information. Inaccurate inventory records may lead to a variety of undesirable effects, such as troubles in taxing and compliance failure with custom terms. As the common way to address this problem in the past, the traditional physical auditing is always time-consuming and costly, especially when the inventory is various and massive. Moreover, since the multiple stakeholders involvement in custom warehouses, the fault detection and diagnosis processes for inventory record inaccuracy in reality are usually problematic and complicated. Without the effective communication and cooperation between different stakeholders, it is difficult to solve inventory record inaccuracy issues and to guarantee the efficiency and reliability of customwarehousemanagement.

50|$|In 2006, Saudi Arabia made {{it easier}} to start a {{business}} by simplifying processes at its Ministry of Commerce and cut registration time from 64 days to 39. The Saudi Arabian General Investment Agency (SAGIA) finalized agreements with 17 government agencies to remove impediments and introduce incentives for businesses. SAGIA also launched its “10/10” project targeting the top ten by 2010. The reform continued in 2007, the time for start-up dropped from 39 days to 15 days by eliminating layers of bureaucracy. Procedures at its Ministry of Commerce were sped up, publication requirements were merged and social security registration with the Chamber of commerce was automated. The reforms cut 6 procedures for forming a new company from 13 to 7 and the cost from 59% of income per capita to 32%. The commercial registration fees with its Ministry of Commerce were reduced by 80%, reducing the time to start a business by two days. It eliminated the requirement to publish the summary Articles of Association in the local newspaper. Instead, they need to be published only in the official gazette, at a cost of just 1,500-3,000 riyals. Saudi Arabia continued to <b>simplify</b> regulation <b>formalities,</b> in 2009 one-stop system was created at the Ministry of Commerce for business registration and permits.

40|$|Customs administrations {{require an}} active use of {{information}} and communication technologies (ICT) to become more effective and efficient. The objective is to use electronic data instead of paper documents and to connect different computer systems of government agencies and businesses. Against the backdrop of a fast-changing international trade environment and information technology innovation, the Single Window concept emerged and has been adopted by several governments with a view to streamlining and simplifying regulatory requirements in the trans-border movement of goods. Single window systems aim to <b>simplify</b> border <b>formalities</b> for traders and other economic operators by arranging for a single electronic submission of information to fulfill all cross-border regulatory requirements, and it is thus preeminently a tool for trade facilitation. This research paper, which constitutes part of the WCO Single Window Compendium: How to build a Single Window Environment, summarizes the results of a WCO survey that aimed to provide a global snapshot of single window implementation using a convenience sample of WCO Members. The main purpose of the study is to offer an overview of Customs cargo clearance systems that are the basis for a single window environment; to outline the implementation of single window in its practical and operational dimensions; to shed light on technical tools for data harmonization such as the WCO Data Model as well as security frameworks (as an enabler of information exchange between border agencies); and to present challenges in developing and advancing a single window system.
