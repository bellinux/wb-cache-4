5|$|I was {{as student}} in the sixties, engaged {{in the civil rights}} movement, anti-Vietnam War protests. I'd come from New York to attend the University of Wisconsin. It was an {{exciting}} time. A lot of active students wound up in different cities and communities as organizers. I chose Racine, Wisconsin. I spent three years there. We had developed a legal clinic and we had a whole health program, but the city was too small. I had, of course, heard about Uptown in Chicago, and the challenges. So I wound up here in 1976. I waited tables. I did photography, took pictures for attorneys. Ultimately we <b>started</b> <b>our</b> own print shop in order to print our own newspapers and magazines.|$|E
25|$|I {{think we}} were all pretty naive about what we, what we were achieving—we were having too much fun to get kind of caught up. We'd just {{released}} our second album overseas on an independent label; and, spent time in America as an independent act. And that was around about the time where we <b>started</b> <b>our</b> own label, just to, um, release, maybe, release a few, some bands of friends of ours, in bands.|$|E
25|$|Matsuhashi and Hallett's {{study can}} be {{summarized}} thus. The researchers hypothesized that, if our conscious intentions are what causes movement genesis (i.e. the start of an action), then naturally, our conscious intentions should always occur before any movement has begun. Otherwise, if we ever become aware of a movement only after {{it has already been}} <b>started,</b> <b>our</b> awareness could not have been the cause of that particular movement. Simply put, conscious intention must precede action if it is its cause.|$|E

25|$|Set {{off from}} Paris on Friday 21 June 1895 at 5.25am from the Porte Maillot, where Monsieur Haufert, {{timekeeper}} of the Union, {{gave us the}} starting signal, we crossed the Bois de Boulogne towards Versailles. The weather was cold, that damp coldness of some mornings in June which makes you search for a light jacket and freezes your hands; but we were full of ardour, replete with good advice and lots of energy and it was happily that Richard and I on the tandem and our trainer Lambert on a bicycle <b>started</b> <b>our</b> long journey for the record from Paris to Agen.|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the songs}} on Slap-Happy were {{recorded}} before the band decided to form Wax Tadpole. Sparks and Gardner wrote all the songs, usually at Gardner's home, even though the whole group contributed to the album {{in one form or}} another. Unlike its predecessor, Slap-Happy was made with a low budget. According to Sparks, [...] "We utilized a lot of home studios, did a lot of our tracking ourselves, used a lot of first takes. I think there's a lot of life in this record, and yet I think when we <b>started</b> <b>our</b> own label we were fearing having to take a major step down in production because of the financial aspects." [...] The album was produced by Brian Haught, a friend of the band who let the band use his studio [...] "just out of the kindness of his heart." [...] It was recorded and mixed at Synical Labs, PCS Studios, Sound City, de Prume Studios, Sonors Studios, and King Sound and Pictures in Los Angeles. Audio mastering took place at Precision Mastering in Los Angeles.|$|E
2500|$|After [...] "Greatest Hits" [...] was released, {{the band}} {{announced}} a two-year break. On 15 April 2006, Marie Serneholt's Swedish website officially {{announced that the}} A-Teens had parted ways. A reason for the departure was yet to be announced. In one magazine Marie Serneholt stated, [...] "The A-Teens are nothing but a memory now, we have all <b>started</b> <b>our</b> own projects." [...] Another member of the group, Dhani Lennevald, confirmed his former groupmate's comment.|$|E

2500|$|McMahon ran as an outsider, {{criticizing the}} Senate for its {{connection}} to Wall Street and federal banking bailouts. Her campaign ads emphasized her distance from politics, stressing she was [...] "not a career politician". She criticized the current Senate for passing large bills in a perfunctory manner, particularly the $800 billion stimulus package. Her first televised political ad, [...] "Perseverance", touted her {{experience as a}} business leader, stating, [...] "Thirty years ago, my husband and I <b>started</b> <b>our</b> business. It wasn’t always easy but we grew it into a publicly traded company that’s creating jobs here in Connecticut today." ...|$|E

60|$|Summoned noiselessly by the cook, Bill came up {{from the}} forecastle, and on {{learning}} what was required of him pursed up his lips and <b>started</b> <b>our</b> noble anthem with a whistle of such richness and volume that the horrified skipper was almost deafened with it. It acted on the mate like a charm, and he came from below and closed Bill's mouth, none too gently, with a hand which shook with excitement. Then, as quietly as possible, he closed the companion and secured the fastenings.|$|E
60|$|The trail {{continued}} wet, muddy, {{and full}} of slippery inclines, but we camped on a beautiful spot {{on the edge of}} a marshy lake two or three miles in length. As we threw up our tent and <b>started</b> <b>our</b> fire, I heard two cranes bugling magnificently from across the marsh, and with my field-glass I could see them striding along in the edge of the water. The sun was getting well toward the west. All around stood the dark and mysterious forest, out of which strange noises broke.|$|E

6000|$|Upon the {{following}} day, which was October tenth, we <b>started</b> <b>our</b> bear hunting. Haught's method {{appeared to me}} to lack something. He sent the hounds down below the rim with George; and taking R.C. and me, and Lee and Nielsen, he led us over to what he called Horton Thicket. Never would I forget my first sight of that immense forest-choked canyon. It was a great cove running up from the basin into the rim. Craggy ledges, broken, ruined, tottering and gray, slanted down into this abyss. The place was so vast that these ledges appeared far apart, yet they were many. An empire of splintered cliff! ...|$|E
60|$|Strange to relate, it was {{not till}} my Viking, with a rueful face, {{reminded}} me of the fact, that I bethought me of a circumstance somewhat alarming at the first blush. We must push off without chart or quadrant; though, as will shortly be seen, a compass was by no means out of the question. The chart, to be sure, I did not so much lay to heart; but a quadrant was more than desirable. Still, it was by no means indispensable. For this reason. When we <b>started,</b> <b>our</b> latitude would be exactly known; and whether, on our voyage westward, we drifted north or south therefrom, we could not, by any possibility, get so far out of our reckoning, as to fail in striking some one of a long chain of islands, which, for many degrees, {{on both sides of the}} equator, stretched right across our track.|$|E
6000|$|Poor Bill {{found very}} soon that {{his house and}} {{furniture}} were to be kept at such an ideal point of perfection that he needed another house to live in,--for, poor fellow, he found the difference between having a house and a home. It was only {{a year or two}} after that my wife and I <b>started</b> <b>our</b> ménage on very different principles, and Bill would often drop in upon us, wistfully lingering in the cosy armchair between my writing-table and my wife's sofa, and saying with a sigh how confoundedly pleasant things looked there,--so pleasant to have a bright, open fire, and geraniums and roses and birds, and all that sort of thing, and to dare to stretch out one's legs and move without thinking what one was going to hit. [...] "Sophie is a good girl!" [...] he would say, [...] "and wants to have everything right, but you see they won't let her. They've loaded her with so many things that have to be kept in lavender that the poor girl is actually getting thin and losing her health; and then, you see, there's Aunt Zeruah, she mounts guard at our house, and keeps up such strict police regulations that a fellow can't do a thing. The parlors are splendid, but so lonesome and dismal!--not a ray of sunshine, in fact not a ray of light, except when a visitor is calling, and then they open a crack. They're afraid of flies, and yet, dear knows, they keep every looking-glass and picture-frame muffled to its throat from March to December. I'd like, for curiosity, to see what a fly would do in our parlors!" ...|$|E
