Two pairs of residues at positions 190 – 191 and 198 – 208 (Arno numbering) in <b>Sec</b> 7 <b>d</b> contribute equally to the stability of BFA binding, which is also sensitive to mutation of H 80 in ARF 1.

As shown in Table 4, all SECs carry out the functions listed under the first heading of educational research, with one exception: Institutions B 1 and D 2 do not partner with institutional research to explore base-line data.

For each of these SECs, the research and development component of their mission provides emphasis in this area, and their director’s expertise leads to rich opportunities. While SEC F 3 does not have a role in developing innovative curricula, it does partner with the Center for Teaching and Learning to provide assessment expertise for faculty and departments who are implementing innovations.

Gli esemplari analizzati, che coprono un arco cronologico tra il III sec. a. C. ed il I <b>sec.</b> <b>d.</b> C., attestano l’esistenza di più varianti: in un primo gruppo il rapporto tra leonté e testa è più proporzionato, la criniera è poco folta e la mandibola poggia sotto l’orecchio; nel secondo la criniera assume volume ed una spalla compare in primo piano; nel terzo la leonté arretra verso la nuca e copre tempie ed orecchio. L’origine del tipo va ricondotta all’identificazione tra Alessandro ed il giovane Eracle con le spoglie del leone di Nemea, legame evidenziato soprattutto attraverso i coni monetali ed i ritratti scultorei del sovrano macedone.

We compare {{the results of the}} worm algorithm to complex Langevin and multiparameter reweighting. Using the worm algorithm, the thermodynamics of the model is investigated, and continuum results are shown for the pressure at different μ/T values in the range 0 - 4. By performing T= 0 simulations using the worm algorithm the Silver Blaze phenomenon is reproduced. Regarding the complex Langevin, we test various implementations of discretizing the complex Langevin equation. We found that the exponentialized Euler discretization of the Langevin equation gives wrong results for the action and the density at low T/m. By performing continuum extrapolation we found that this discrepancy does not disappear and depends slightly on temperature. The discretization with spherical coordinates perform similarly at low μ/T, but goes wrong also at some higher temperatures at high μ/T. However, a third discretization that uses a constraining force to achieve the ϕ^ 2 = 1 condition gives correct results for the action, but wrong results for the density at low μ/T.

The PFC of six human subjects in response to anagram tasks is investigated using multichannel fNIRS. Concentration changes of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin in the PFC are measured with variable anagram durations and at two difficulty levels (four- and six-letter anagrams). The durations to perform the selected anagram tasks range from several seconds {{to more than one}} minute. The dorsolateral PFC areas exhibit consistent and strong hemodynamic deactivation during and shortly after task execution. The superposition principle of a linear system is employed to investigate nonlinear hemodynamic features among three task duration subgroups: D 1 = 2. 0 <b>sec,</b> <b>D</b> 2 = 4. 0 sec, and D 3 = 8. 0 sec.

We observed over the activated barrel a positive BOLD signal and increased levels of deoxyhemoglobin and total hemoglobin during each period of prolonged (30 <b>sec)</b> <b>D</b> 2 vibrissal stimulation. These data show that the hemodynamic basis of this fMRI signal is not necessarily a washout of deoxyhemoglobin, as generally assumed. Instead, they suggest that a positive BOLD signal can also be caused by a local increase of blood volume, even if deoxyhemoglobin levels are persistently elevated.

40|$|In Sweden {{the main}} {{principle}} is that interest expenses are deductable. The rules of limitations on interest deduction are exemptions to this main principle. The provisions, which came into {{force on the}} first of January 2009, have been inserted into Chapter 24 secs. 10 a – e Swedish Income Tax Act (ITA). They are based on intercompany transactions that the Swedish Tax Agency has found have been carried out to deduct interest in Sweden while the recipient of the interest has a limited liability of taxation or is not liable of taxation at all. The limitations on interest deduction aim to preclude such operations and the main purpose is to preserve the Swedish tax base from tax revenue loss. The provisions have been criticized and the Swedish Tax Agency has been appointed by the Swedish Government to analyze the prevalence of interest deductions and the need for new deductibility limitations. This thesis aim to analyze whether the Swedish Tax Agency’s proposal of amendments on the limitations on interest deduction are adapted to its purpose. The Swedish Tax Agency has as a proposal stated that a form of disclosure-rules should be adopted. Disclosure-rules imply a liability on persons liable of taxation to declare for their way of tax planning. Such rules would increase the knowledge necessary for the Swedish Tax Agency. The conclusion that can be drawn is that disclosure-rules are appropriate. They would improve the opportunity to fulfil the purpose of the limitations on interest deduction, namely preclude tax planning. Another proposal of amendment from the Swedish Tax Agency is that the provision in Chapter 24 <b>sec.</b> 10 <b>d</b> second paragraph ITA should be generally applicable. It is questionable whether a provision with such content affects the legal security for the persons liable of taxation. A general application of this provision cannot be seen as adapted to its purpose. The rule result in an increased legal insecurity for the companies and the sharpening that the rule implies is not incentivized. The Swedish Tax Agency further propose that a decision according to Chapter 24 <b>sec.</b> 10 <b>d</b> second paragraph ITA could be decided in disadvantage for the person liable of taxation during a time limit of five years after the assessment year. The companies float in insecurity what tax effects their intercompany transactions would get. The companies legal insecurity is not proportional to the possible restrained effect such rule may have.

Busca esclarecer sua importância como fenômeno inaugural da igreja, ocorrido durante a festa de Pentecostes na cidade Jerusalém (<b>séc.</b> I <b>d.</b> C.); pretende também mostrar seu papel na difusão do Cristianismo mundo afora; e, finalmente, informar que essa difusão só foi possível porque a glossolalia e a comunicação são fenômenos que mantêm uma relação de interdependência e complementaridade entre si. This article {{reflects}} {{the study of}} glossollaly {{as described in the}} Holy Bible, particularly in the book of the Acts of the Apostles, known as the "speaking in tongues", and it has, as its focus, the same phenomenon and its relationship with the media, in particular, with the Christian communication. The aim is to clarify its importance as an inaugural phenomenon that occurred during the feast of Pentecost in the city of Jerusalem (1 d. C); also to show its role in the dissemination of Christianity worldwide; and finally, inform that this dissemination was only possible because the glossollaly and communication are institutions which maintained a relationship of interdependence and complements between themselves...|$|R
40|$|O presente trabalho visa analisar a partir do tema sacrifício a questão martirial, e em especial, como se da sua construção e influência. Tertuliano, este apologista africano da cidade de Cartago, que se apresenta enquanto o maior e o mais influente centro cristao da África, se apresenta enquanto um crítico e defensor dos cristãos africanos, especialmente a partir de suas obras Apologeticum e Ad Martyras objetos deste trabalho. O cristianismo africano tem grande desenvolvimento no período de transicão entre o II e o III <b>Séc.</b> <b>d.</b> C., na Africa romanizada. As obras em questão se apresentam dentro do momento de confronto entre a nova religião, o cristianismo, e as tradicionais expressoes religiosas romanas, o paganismo. Deste confronto surgirá as perseguições aos cristãos, tendo estas um papel {{fundamental}} no surgimento, fortalecimento e expansão dos mártires cristãos durante o domínio do Império Romano na África. This study aims {{to analyze}} the subject from the sacrifice the issue of martyrdom, and in particular, as the construction and influence. Tertullian, this apologist African city of Carthage, which present as {{the largest and most}} influential Christian center in Africa, is presented as a critic and champion of African Christians, from his works Ad Martyras and Apologeticum objectives of this study. African Christianity has greatly developed during the transition period between the II and III century d. C., in Africa Romanized. The works in question are present in the moment of confrontation between the new religion, Christianity, and traditional religious expressions Roman paganism. This confrontation is the persecution of Christians, the latter having a role in the emergence force and expansion of the Christian martyrs during the reign of the Roman Empire in Africa...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThrough the Curry-Howard correspondence, {{dependent}} type {{theories are}} appealing {{to both the}} mathematical and the programming community. To the first, they provide an expressive logical framework, in which mathematics can be developed. To the second, they offer a functional programming language that allows to state precise invariants programs have to respect and to build certified proofs thereof. Several dependent type systems have been investigated and implemented, with some early ones geared more to-wards the mathematical community [Con+ 86; Pol 94; Coq 12], called proof-assistants, and later putting a stronger accent on their viability as a programming environment [McB 99; Nor 07; Soz 08]. The Calculus of Inductive Constructions (pCIC) is one such theory that attempts to stay faithful to the correspondence and bridge the two worlds of programming and proving. It is implemented in the Coq system [Coq 12] and Matita [Asp+ 11]. The utilisation of Coq as a programming language as advocated by Sozeau relies on extending pCIC with a principle known as proof-irrelevance, which means that any two proofs of a logical proposition are identified by the system. This principle does not hold in the current theory and implementation of Coq, but as proofs appear as parts of dependently typed programs, {{they get in the}} way during their verification. Furthermore, it corresponds to the mathematical intuition that the existence of a proof of a theorem is more important than its exact wording. In fact, under this aspect, there have been demands for proof-irrelevance in the community of interactive theorem provers since the beginning of their development, for instance in automath [Ned 94, <b>Sec.</b> <b>D.</b> 3]. We studied how to extend pCIC in order to incorporate this principle...|$|E

La tomba del medico” Aquileia nostra”, 55, 1984, p. 78 - 108.). Among the various finds is present a bronze box (capsula), several medicinal preparations in the solid state form were also found inside. They were collyria (from the greek = κολλύριον small pills solid elongated), not necessarily used in ophthalmologic practice (Celse V 28 G; Hippocrates, Mul. I 51). In bibliography, rare are the articles published regarding the discovery of these findings, but even more rare are articles on collyria chemical analysis. In this study, 17 collyria / fragments of collyria exposed in Este National Museum and other six fragments from the tomb of a physician and stored in warehouses, using non-invasive and non-destructive techniques were analyzed in-situ. Raman microscopy, FT-IR spectroscopy and X-ray Fluorescence techniques were chosen for the analysis using portable equipments. In this study we report the preliminary composition data of these remains. The analyzes performed, chemical charaterized several components already identified to the specific literature on these findings: calcite, indrocerussite, litharge, cuprite, tenorite, azzurite, realgar, pararealgar, orpiment. Moreover in this work some components, not analyzed in collyria forms yet, were also identified: pyrite and alumina. In the next future could be interesting study the remains with micro-invasive techniques, this in order to better investigate the organic component present and complete the knowledge of these rare and interesting archaeological finds, on which many questions still remain open and unanswered...|$|E
40|$|This mini-review {{summarizes}} studies my {{associates and}} I carried out {{that are relevant}} to the topic of the present volume [i. e. glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) ] using radioactive 13 N (t 9. 96 min) as a biological tracer. These studies revealed the previously unrecognized rapidity with which nitrogen is exchanged among certain metabolites in vivo. For example, our work demonstrated that a) the t for conversion of portal vein ammonia to urea in the rat liver is ~ 10 – 11 sec, despite the need for five enzyme-catalyzed steps and two mitochondrial transport steps, b) the residence time for ammonia in the blood of anesthetized rats is ≤ 7 – 8 sec, c) the t for incorporation of blood-borne ammonia into glutamine in the normal rat brain is < 3 <b>sec,</b> and <b>d)</b> equilibration between glutamate and aspartate nitrogen in rat liver is extremely rapid (seconds), a reflection {{of the fact that the}} components of the hepatic aspartate aminotransferase reaction are in thermodynamic equilibrium. Our work emphasizes the importance of the GDH reaction in rat liver as a conduit for dissimilating or assimilating ammonia as needed. In contrast, our work shows that the GDH reaction in rat brain appears to operate mostly in the direction of ammonia production (dissimilation). The importance of the GDH reaction as an endogenous source of ammonia in th...|$|R
40|$|The National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS) {{has played}} a key role in conserving at-risk species from its {{beginnings}} in 1903 when President Theodore Roosevelt established apreserve to protect Pelican Island, in Florida, as a breeding ground for an imperiled population of brown pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis) (Fischman 2003). Today, the Atlantic coast population of the brown pelican is no longer in need of protection under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), but Pelican Island National Wildlife Refuge provides protection for nine threatened and endangered species. Management of the refuge system has changed significantly since the presidency of Teddy Roosevelt, evolving from the creation of 2 ̆ 2 inviolate sanctuar[ies] 2 ̆ 2 (Act ofFebruary 18, 1929, <b>sec.</b> 715 <b>d)</b> through aperiod in which conservation of wildlife and natural communities was balanced with public uses, often to the detriment of conservation (Curtin 1993), to the current period in which the refuge system is to be managed to protect biological integrity, diversity, and environmental health, the management mandates enacted in the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997 (Act ofOctober 9, 1997; Gergely et al. 2000). This chapter describes the role the National Wildlife Refuge System plays in conserving species listed under the ESA, identifies factors that limit the refuge system 2 ̆ 7 s effectiveness in achieving that objective, and identifies opportunities to increase imperiled species conservation within the refuge system...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{present a}} new set of contour maps of the seismic {{structure}} of North America and the surrounding ocean basins. These maps include the crustal thickness, whole-crustal average P-wave and S-wave velocity, and seismic velocity of the up-permost mantle, that is, Pn and Sn. We found the following: (1) The average thickness of the crust under North America is 36. 7 km (standard deviation [s. d. ] 8. 4 km), which is 2. 5 km thinner than the world average of 39. 2 km (s. d. 8. 5) for continental crust; (2) Histograms of whole-crustal P- and S-wave velocities for the North Amer-ican crust are bimodal, with the lower peak occurring for crust without a high-velocity (6. 9 – 7. 3 km/sec) lower crustal layer; (3) Regions with anomalously high average crustal P-wave velocities correlate with Precambrian and Paleozoic orogens; low average crustal velocities are correlated with modern extensional regimes; (4) The average Pn velocity beneath North America is 8. 03 km/sec (s. d. 0. 19 km/sec); (5) the well-known thin crust beneath the western United States extends into north-west Canada; (6) the average P-wave velocity of layer 3 of oceanic crust is 6. 61 km/ <b>sec</b> (s. <b>d.</b> 0. 47 km/sec). However, the average crustal P-wave velocity under the eastern Pacific seafloor is higher than the western Atlantic seafloor due to the thicker sediment layer on the older Atlantic seafloor...|$|R
