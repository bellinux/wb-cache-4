It was widely assumed that Minh, who had no history of aggressive action against the communists, {{would be able to}} establish a cease-fire and re-open negotiations. Such hope was unrealistic. Their opponent, {{for the first time since}} the First Indochina War, held the upper hand on the battlefield and victory was within reach, regardless of any political changes in Saigon. They would not be denied victory, the only thing for which they had <b>striven</b> <b>for</b> over 30 years. The hope that the communists would make the same mistake they did 21 years prior by complying with the Geneva Agreements while the US and State of Vietnam did not was futile.|$|E
5|$|The FPÖ is a {{descendant}} of the pan-German and national liberal camp (Lager) {{dating back to the}} Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas. During the interwar era, the national liberal camp (gathered in the Greater German People's Party) fought against the mutually-hostile Christian Social and Marxist camps in their struggles to structure the new republic according to their respective ideologies. After a short civil war, the Federal State of Austria, an authoritarian Christian Social dictatorship, was established in 1934. By 1938, with the Anschluss of Austria into Nazi Germany, the national liberal camp (which had always <b>striven</b> <b>for</b> an inclusion of Austria into a Greater Germany) had been swallowed whole by Austrian National Socialism and all other parties were eventually absorbed into Nazi totalitarianism. Both Socialists and Christian Socials were persecuted under the Nazi regime, and the national liberal camp was scarred after the war due to guilt by association with National Socialism.|$|E

40|$|Whereas some {{researchers}} have argued that perfectionism in sports is maladaptive because it is related to dysfunctional characteristics such as higher competitive anxiety, the present article argues that <b>striving</b> <b>for</b> perfection is not maladaptive and is unrelated to competitive anxiety. Four samples of athletes (high school athletes, female soccer players, and two samples of university student athletes) completed measures of per-fectionism during competitions and competitive anxiety. Across samples, results show that overall perfec-tionism was associated with higher cognitive and somatic competitive anxiety. However, when <b>striving</b> <b>for</b> perfection and negative reactions to imperfection were differentiated, only the latter were associated with higher anxiety, whereas <b>striving</b> <b>for</b> perfection was unrelated to anxiety. Moreover, once the influence of negative reactions to imperfection was partialled out, <b>striving</b> <b>for</b> perfection was associated with lower anx-iety and higher self-confidence. The present findings suggest that <b>striving</b> <b>for</b> perfection in sports is not mal-adaptive. On the contrary, athletes who <b>strive</b> <b>for</b> perfection and successfully control their negative reactions to imperfection may even experience less anxiety and more self-confidence during competitions.

500|$|For his {{stewardship}} of the Air Force prior to World WarII, {{as well as his}} part in its establishment in 1921, Williams is considered the [...] "father" [...] of the RAAF. The epithet had earlier been applied to Eric Harrison, who had sole charge of Central Flying School after Henry Petre was posted to the Middle East in 1915, and was also {{a founding member of the}} RAAF. By the 1970s, the mantle had settled on Williams. Between the wars he had continually <b>striven</b> <b>for</b> his service's status as a separate branch of the Australian armed forces, seeing off several challenges to its independence from Army and Navy interests. He remains the RAAF's longest-serving Chief, totalling thirteen years over three terms: October to December 1922; February 1925 to December 1932; and June 1934 to February 1939.|$|E

With all this, however, Mr. Pound, like so many others who have <b>striven</b> <b>for</b> advancement of intelligence and culture in England, has made more enemies than friends... Much of the Press has been deliberately closed by cabal to him; his books have for some time been ignored or written down; and he himself has been compelled to live on much less than would support a navvy. His fate, as I have said, is not unusual... Taken by and large, England hates men of culture until they are dead.|$|E
500|$|Zwingli criticised the {{practice}} of priestly chanting and monastic choirs. The criticism dates from 1523 when he attacked certain worship practices. His arguments are detailed in the Conclusions of 1525, in which, Conclusions 44, 45 and 46 are concerned with musical practices {{under the rubric of}} [...] "prayer". He associated music with images and vestments, all of which he felt diverted people's attention from true spiritual worship. It is not known what he thought of the musical practices in early Lutheran churches. Zwingli, however, eliminated instrumental music from worship in the church, stating that God had not commanded it in worship. The organist of the People's Church in Zurich is recorded as weeping upon seeing the great organ broken up. Although Zwingli did not express an opinion on congregational singing, he made no effort to encourage it. Nevertheless, scholars have found that Zwingli was supportive of a role for music in the church. Gottfried W. Locher writes, [...] "The old assertion 'Zwingli was against church singing' holds good no longer... Zwingli's polemic is concerned exclusively with the medieval Latin choral and priestly chanting and not with the hymns of evangelical congregations or choirs". Locher {{goes on to say that}} [...] "Zwingli freely allowed vernacular psalm or choral singing. In addition, he even seems to have <b>striven</b> <b>for</b> lively, antiphonal, unison recitative". Locher then summarizes his comments on Zwingli's view of church music as follows: [...] "The chief thought in his conception of worship was always 'conscious attendance and understanding'—'devotion', yet with the lively participation of all concerned".|$|E
50|$|The {{four stages}} of life {{complete}} the four human strivings in life, according to Hinduism. Dharma enables the individual to satisfy the <b>striving</b> <b>for</b> stability and order, a life that is lawful and harmonious, the striving {{to do the right}} thing, be good, be virtuous, earn religious merit, be helpful to others, interact successfully with society. The other three strivings are Artha - the <b>striving</b> <b>for</b> means of life such as food, shelter, power, security, material wealth, etc.; Kama - the <b>striving</b> <b>for</b> sex, desire, pleasure, love, emotional fulfillment, etc.; and Moksa - the <b>striving</b> <b>for</b> spiritual meaning, liberation from life-rebirth cycle, self-realisation in this life, etc. The four stages are neither independent nor exclusionary in Hindu Dharma.|$|R

2500|$|Theodor Adorno, {{a leading}} philosopher of the Frankfurt School, who was {{strongly}} influenced by Hegel, tried to take a middle path between these extremes: Adorno contradicted Hegel's motto [...] "the true is the whole" [...] with his new version, [...] "the whole is the false," [...] but he wished to preserve critical theory as a negative, oppositional version of the utopia described by Hegel's [...] "spirit." [...] Adorno believed in totality and human potential as ends to be <b>striven</b> <b>for,</b> but not as certainties.|$|E
2500|$|Also in {{the early}} texts, {{tangential}} to its role in establishing guilt, atar is the light of revelation through which Zoroaster is selected for prophet-hood, the Zarathushtra Mainyu Athra (Yasna 31.3), radiated by Wisdom/Mazda (43.9), bearing the conviction of [...] "Good Purpose" [...] (Vohu Manah, 43.4; see also Amesha Spenta), and enlightening one’s inner-self (46.7). Within this framework {{of the concept of}} divine illumination, atar radiates the [...] "other lights" [...] (31.7), the essence (of Mazda) from which insight and wisdom permeate the universe. So also Zoroaster's injunction to always pray in the presence of atar—either towards the sun, or towards their own hearths—so as to better concentrate their devotions on asha, righteousness, and the virtue that should be <b>striven</b> <b>for</b> (Yasna 43.9, see also Boyce, 1975:455).|$|E
2500|$|Expedient means (Skt. upāya) {{is found}} in the Lotus Sutra, one of the earliest-dated sutras, and is {{accepted}} in all Mahāyāna schools of thought. It is any effective method that aids awakening. It {{does not necessarily mean that}} some particular method is [...] "untrue" [...] but is simply any means or stratagem that is conducive to spiritual growth and leads beings to awakening and nirvana. Expedient means could thus be certain motivational words for a particular listener or even the Noble Eightfold Path itself. Basic Buddhism (what Mahāyāna would term śrāvakayāna or pratyekabuddhayāna) is an expedient method for helping people begin the noble Buddhist path and advance quite far. But the path is not wholly traversed, according to some schools, until the practitioner has <b>striven</b> <b>for</b> and attained Buddhahood for the liberation of all other sentient beings from suffering.|$|E

2500|$|Evolution {{is imposed}} on species or groups. It is not planned or <b>striven</b> <b>for</b> in some Lamarckist way. The {{mutations}} {{on which the}} process depends are random events, and, except for the [...] "silent mutations" [...] which do not affect the functionality or appearance of the carrier, are thus usually disadvantageous, and their chance of proving to be useful {{in the future is}} vanishingly small. Therefore, while a species or group might benefit by being able to adapt to a new environment through the accumulation {{of a wide range of}} genetic variation, this is to the detriment of the individuals who have to carry these mutations until a small, unpredictable minority of them ultimately contributes to such an adaptation. Thus, the capability to evolve is a group adaptation, which has been discredited by, among others, George C. Williams, John Maynard Smith and Richard Dawkins.

2500|$|One {{consequence}} {{of this is that}} the target audience is extremely fluid: while some of his works are clearly published as children's literature (picture books, cassettes), the distinction between youth, young adult and adult literature is not easily made; traditional story-telling addresses the entire community at once. [...] The interplay of truth and fiction, always difficult concepts, is a recurring theme in Schami's writings. [...] Der ehrliche Lügner opens with the words: [...] "My name is Sadik, but not even that is certain." [...] Elsewhere we are told that the important thing is not whether stories are true, but rather how we live with them (A Handful of Stars). [...] Although elements from fairy-tale worlds may appear in these stories, they are always rooted in daily life. [...] Schami has made a distinction between Illusion and Phantasie (illusion and vision). [...] Illusion is an unachievable dream, distorting the world to something impossible, whereas vision is the imaginative construction of achievable goals; rooted in reality it indicates something which can be <b>striven</b> <b>for,</b> but this reality means also accepting the other possibility, that there may not be a happy ending. [...] Asked by a radio interviewer whether literature is an escape from reality, Schami answers, yes: but one which enables the reader to return to reality better equipped.|$|E
