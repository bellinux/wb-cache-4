5|$|Following the goal, Independiente under {{instruction}} from their manager José Pastoriza, began to <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> {{in their own}} half inviting Liverpool to attack them. Their plan worked as Liverpool were unable to break down their defence, while their strikers Percudani and Alejandro Barberón counter-attacked when Independiente received the ball. The second half saw Liverpool continue to attack the Independiente goal, but to no avail. Midfielders John Wark and Mølby {{tried to find a}} way through the Independiente defence was equal to their efforts. Wark's efforts trying to engineer an equalising goal resulted in him being substituted for Ronnie Whelan in the 76th minute, due to fatigue.|$|E
5|$|The opening {{passages}} {{of the match}} were tentative. Faced with a hostile atmosphere, Liverpool were content to <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> and frustrate Roma. Despite this tactic, Liverpool {{took the lead in}} the 15th minute. Souness and Sammy Lee exchanged passes before passing to Craig Johnston on the right hand side of the pitch. Johnston played a high cross into the Roma penalty area, which was challenged for by Roma goalkeeper Franco Tancredi and Ronnie Whelan. The result was that Tancredi dropped the ball, Roma defenders tried to clear the ball, but Michele Nappi's attempted clearance bounced off Tancredi's back and fell to Liverpool defender Phil Neal who scored to give Liverpool a 1–0 lead. Two minutes later, Souness volleyed the ball into the Roma goal from close range, but his goal was disallowed for offside.|$|E
25|$|A djembe and dunun {{ensemble}} traditionally {{does not}} play music {{for people to}} simply <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> and listen to. Instead, the ensemble creates rhythm for people to dance, sing, clap, or work to. The western distinction between musicians and audience is inappropriate in a traditional context. A rhythm is rarely played as a performance, but is participatory: musicians, dancers, singers, and onlookers {{are all part of}} the ensemble and frequently change roles while the music is in progress.|$|E

25|$|The land {{upon which}} the city was built, as well {{as much of the}} {{surrounding}} area, was obtained by Englishman Thomas Fenwick from the Native Americans. In 1869, businessman Isaac Coffin built the first beach-front cottage to receive paying guests. During those days, people arrived by stage coach and ferry. They came to fish off the shore, to enjoy the natural beauty of the Atlantic Ocean pounding against the long strip of sandy beach, to collect seashells, or just to <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> and watch the rolling surf.|$|E

25|$|The {{trail that}} splits from the {{snowmobile}} route {{a mile from}} the Platte Clove trailhead curves back another mile or so to Huckleberry Point, a steep and ledgy area which, due to past fires, offers many places to <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> and look down into the clove. Since the route is mostly level, and the roundtrip considerably shorter than that required for the whole mountain, it is popular with those who hike only occasionally. Care must be taken at the Point, however, since some of the ledges also sit above sharp drops.|$|E

25|$|Dispensability in a {{group is}} {{described}} by Price as employees who join a work group and quickly begin to measure up their skills with {{the people that they}} are assigned to work with. If they feel that their skills are inferior to those around them, people tend to <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> and let the other more skilled workers carry the workload. Fairness {{in a group}} is when some group members feel that their voice is not heard in decision making because of their ethnicity, gender or other discriminatory factors. Instead of fighting for their voice to be heard many group members will decide to loaf in these circumstances.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 1980s, Courtney {{was part of}} a {{movement}} within the UDA that became frustrated with the directions being taken by the UDA leadership. He argued that too little was being done by the movement in terms of killing republicans as the leaders were too happy to <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> and become rich from extortion and racketeering. Courtney was soon involved in conspiracies to overthrow the UDA leadership. These however came to nothing as the fallout from the Stevens Inquiries saw the existing leadership swept aside. For his part, Courtney would go on {{to become part of the}} new leadership that emerged in the 1990s around Johnny Adair.|$|E

25|$|In Britain, the {{nationalisation}} {{was perceived}} as {{a direct threat to}} British interests. In a letter to the British Ambassador on 10 September 1956, Sir Ivone Kirkpatrick, the Permanent Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office wrote: If we <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> while Nasser consolidates his position and gradually acquires control of the oil-bearing countries, he can and is, according to our information, resolved to wreck us. If Middle Eastern oil is denied to us for a year or two, our gold reserves will disappear. If our gold reserves disappear, the sterling area disintegrates. If the sterling area disintegrates and we have no reserves, we shall not be able to maintain a force in Germany, or indeed, anywhere else. I doubt whether we shall be able to pay for the bare minimum necessary for our defence. And a country that cannot provide for its defence is finished.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year, Wang Jian was recalled to lead {{a second}} invasion with 600,000 men. High in morale after their victory in the previous year, the Chu forces were content to <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> and defend against what they {{expected to be a}} siege of Chu. However, Wang Jian decided to weaken Chu's resolve and tricked the Chu army by appearing to be idle in his fortifications whilst secretly training his troops to fight in Chu territory. After a year, the Chu defenders decided to disband due to apparent lack of action from the Qin. Wang Jian invaded at that point, with full force, and overran Huaiyang and the remaining Chu forces. Chu lost the initiative and could only sustain local guerrilla-style resistance until it too was fully conquered with the destruction of Shouchun and the death of its last leader, Lord Changping, in 223 BC. At their peak, the combined armies of Chu and Qin are estimated to have ranged from hundreds of thousands to a million soldiers, more than those involved in the campaign of Changping between Qin and Zhao 35 years earlier.|$|E

[...] "I'm not one to <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> and say, 'Oh, I feel bad for what happened to them I want the whole world to sing , to bring us together as a world, because a song is a mantra, something you repeat over and over.

500|$|By June 2002, {{the band}} had {{completed}} A Rush of Blood to the Head, but thought their output sounded [...] "rubbish" [...] and {{reached an agreement}} with the label to postpone the release of the album until they were completely satisfied. Subsequently, many songs were discarded because they sounded like they could have been on Parachutes. Martin has claimed {{that it would have been}} uninteresting: [...] "It would have shown that we're happy to <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> on what we'd done, and we're not. For us, it was important to progress and try to improve upon our abilities as musicians."
