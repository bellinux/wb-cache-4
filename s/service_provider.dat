40|$|We are in {{the middle}} of an {{insurgency}} in cloud computing. In short, cloud computing is “a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or <b>services</b> <b>provider</b> interaction. ” Current cloud computing systems pose serious limitation to protecting users' data confidentiality. Since users' sensitive data is presented in unencrypted forms to remote machines owned and operated by third party <b>service</b> <b>providers,</b> the risks of unauthorized disclosure of the users' sensitive data by <b>service</b> <b>providers</b> may be high. Many techniques for protecting users' data from outside attackers are available, but currently there exists no effective way for protecting users' sensitive data from <b>service</b> <b>providers</b> in cloud computing. Our approach is protecting the confidentiality of users' data from <b>service</b> <b>providers,</b> and ensures that <b>service</b> <b>providers</b> cannot access or disclose users' confidential data being processed and stored in cloud computing systems. Our approach has three major aspects: 1) Separating software <b>service</b> <b>providers</b> and infrastructure <b>service</b> <b>providers</b> in cloud computing, 2) Hiding information of the owners of data, and 3) Data obfuscation. An example to show how our approach can protect the confidentiality of users' data from <b>service</b> <b>providers</b> in cloud computing is given and various types of attacks in cloud computing. <b>Service</b> <b>providers</b> neither can see user’s confidential data, nor can modify it. That’s approach is presented in our paper...|$|R
