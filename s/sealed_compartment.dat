50|$|In {{a closed}} system as mineral precipitates, acid accumulates, rapidly {{lowering}} the pH and stopping further precipitation. Cartilage presents no barrier to diffusion and acid therefore diffuses away, allowing precipitation to continue.

In the controlled, <b>sealed</b> <b>compartment,</b> removing H+ drives precipitation under {{a wide variety of}} extracellular conditions, as long as calcium and phosphate are available in the matrix compartment. The mechanism by which acid transits the barrier layer remains uncertain. Osteoblasts have capacity for Na+/H+ exchange via the redundant Na/H exchangers, NHE1 and NHE6. This H+ exchange is a major element in acid removal, although the mechanism by which H+ is transported from the matrix space into the barrier osteoblast is not known.|$|E

40|$|SummarySome {{bacteria}} invade host cells by {{triggering a}} process akin to phagocytosis. We analyzed the mechanisms underlying invasion vacuole formation by the bacterium Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. After engaging integrins on host cells, Yersinia resided in PI(4, 5) P 2 -rich, membrane-bound compartments called “prevacuoles” that were inaccessible to extracellular antibodies but remained {{connected to the}} plasma membrane. The scission of prevacuoles to form separate, <b>sealed</b> <b>compartments</b> coincided with and required PI(4, 5) P 2 hydrolysis. At the time of scission, the inositol 5 -phosphatases OCRL and Inpp 5 b were recruited to prevacuoles. This recruitment and subsequent PI(4, 5) P 2 hydrolysis required the association of the GTPase Rab 5 with prevacuoles. Phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase activity was required for fusion of Rab 5 -positive vesicles with prevacuoles and scission of nascent vacuoles from the plasma membrane. Thus, Yersinia invasion involves a multistep {{process in which the}} bacteria form a protective prevacuole and then recruit host factors to induce membrane fission, allowing the bacteria to invade the cell...|$|R
40|$|Dialysis {{is one of}} {{the most}} used methods for {{biomolecule}} separation based on differences in permeability through membranes. In its simple design, the dialysis membrane works as a physical barrier for molecules larger than the size of the membrane pores. Although simple, the diffusion-driven separation process is slow and requires extended times to complete. However, many of the molecules to be separated are charged; therefore the process may be sped up by adding a supplementary driving force of an electrical nature. Although this principle is utilized for molecular separation based on size and charge, the available instruments require a fixed volume of the sample to be enclosed in a <b>sealed</b> <b>compartment</b> for correct functioning. To avoid sample dilution or poor separation due to insufficient volume, we designed an open dialysis chamber to be used for the separation of molecules by size and charge. The chamber was tested for the separation of dyes from solutions of liposomes, and for buffer exchange. The duration of the dialysis process needed for complete equilibration was less than one hour for all tested samples. In conclusion, electrodialysis may offer a low-cost and fast alternative for separation of ions and charged molecules in small samples...|$|E

It shows how ideas for {{electronically-controlled}} ring-cam pumps with very large torques and variable displacement, which were originally developed for wave energy, {{can be used in}} a tidal-stream generator with a vertical-axis rotor. The arrangement allows all the generation plant to be at the surface in an accessible, <b>sealed</b> <b>compartment</b> at atmospheric pressure.

The velocities in the best tidal streams are about one fifth of typical wind cut-out speeds, but over the time-scale of tens of minutes they are much steadier and also accurately predictable. There is less need of storage and easier integration with network planning. Blades in water can suffer cavitation damage which severely limits tip-speed ratios. Water rotors wil...|$|E
