5|$|A Rebel ship is {{captured}} by a Star Destroyer. On the ship are the droids C-3PO (Quagmire), R2-D2 (Cleveland) and the rebel leader Princess Leia (Lois). While {{the ship is}} boarded by stormtroopers, Leia tries to <b>send</b> <b>an</b> MPEG to Obi-Wan Kenobi through R2, but encounters so many complications that R2 offers to deliver the message himself. Leia {{is captured}} by Darth Vader (Stewie) while R2 and 3PO flee to Tatooine in an escape pod, where they are captured by Jawas.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} Assassins murdered Bohemond's eldest son, Raymond, in 1213. After Bohemond and the Templars laid siege their {{fortress}} at Khawabi, the Assassins sought assistance from Bohemond's old ally, Az-Zahir Ghazi. Az-Zahir Ghazi appealed to Al-Adil, {{although they had}} been enemies. Their alliance forced Bohemond to lift the siege and to <b>send</b> <b>an</b> apology to Az-Zahir Ghazi.|$|E
5|$|Back in Europe, Bernard of Clairvaux was humiliated by the defeat. Bernard {{considered}} it {{his duty to}} <b>send</b> <b>an</b> apology to the Pope and it is inserted {{in the second part}} of his Book of Consideration. There he explains how the sins of the crusaders were the cause of their misfortune and failures. When his attempt to call a new crusade failed, he tried to disassociate himself from the fiasco of the Second Crusade altogether. He would die in 1153.|$|E

5|$|During {{the siege}} at Gythium, Pythagoras had joined Nabis at Sparta, {{bringing}} with him 3,000 men from Argos. When Nabis discovered that Gythium had surrendered {{he decided to}} <b>send</b> <b>an</b> envoy to Flamininus to open negotiations on {{the terms of a}} peace. Nabis offered to withdraw the rest of his garrison from Argos and to hand over to the Romans any deserters and prisoners. Flamininus called another war council. Most of the council felt that they should capture Sparta and unseat Nabis.|$|E

5|$|Several {{proposals}} {{to abolish the}} Electoral College by constitutional amendment have been introduced in Congress over the decades.

5|$|The Student and Instructor {{models were}} also {{introduced}} in the late 1960s. They were designed to teach the piano in the classroom.

This allowed the teacher to monitor individual students' progress.|$|E
5|$|A {{campaign}} to <b>send</b> <b>an</b> American {{side to the}} 1920 games in Antwerp started in California after a Berkeley rugby union touring party returned from British Columbia undefeated in 1920. The United States Olympic Committee (USOC) granted permission for entry. A pool of players from Stanford, Berkeley, and Santa Clara made up the squad. 1908 champion Danny Carroll, a player-coach at Stanford at the time, was the team's most prominent member. When the U.S. arrived in Antwerp, the Czechoslovakian and Romanian teams had withdrawn, leaving only France and the United States. The English RFU {{had decided not to}} enter a team, so as not to interfere with the start of the English domestic season.|$|E
5|$|As {{the date}} for the Normandy {{landings}} (codenamed Operation Overlord) drew near in early 1944, Groves considered that risk was sufficient to <b>send</b> <b>an</b> officer to brief the Supreme Commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower of the possible use of radioactive poisons, particularly plutonium and fission products that might be created in their nuclear reactors. On 8 April 1944, Peterson reported to the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) and met with Eisenhower, his Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Walter Bedell Smith, Assistant Chief of Staff (G-2) (Intelligence), Major General John Whiteley, and his Assistant Chief of Staff (G-3) (Operations), Major General Harold R.

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 13th century, the Omiš {{branch of}} the Kačić family was {{involved}} in the politics of more powerful authorities. Their local hereditary oligarchy disappeared, but the Kačićs probably continued to live in the area. The war with Venice at {{the end of the}} 1270s and the beginning of the 1280s led to their loss of Omiš in favor of princes from the Šubić noble family. The Omiš Kačićs are mentioned for the last time in 1294, when the Venetians wrote to Dubrovnik residents seeking compensation from Dubrovnik authorities who had failed to <b>send</b> <b>an</b> armed ship against Omiš pirates. It is not known whether Ivan, son of Matej Kačić, mentioned in Dubrovnik 1285, was related to the Omišani Kačićs. After that, Kačićs are no longer mentioned.|$|E
5|$|Brundage, {{through his}} tenure, slowly {{came around to}} the {{position}} advocated by Iron Curtain IOC members, that the important thing was to recognize the mainland, with Taiwan of less importance. Although the mainland Chinese were invited by the Munich Olympic organizers to <b>send</b> <b>an</b> observer delegation to Munich (they declined due to the Taiwanese presence), {{it was not until}} 1975, after Brundage's departure as president, that the PRC applied to rejoin the Olympic movement. The PRC again participated at the 1980 Winter Games at Lake Placid and then the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles; the island NOC competed as the Republic of China in 1968 and 1972; when refused permission to compete under that name in 1976, after Brundage's death, it boycotted the 1976 and 1980 games, returning in 1984 as Chinese Taipei.|$|E
5|$|Faced with a {{shortage}} of both funds and men, the Senate decided to <b>send</b> <b>an</b> embassy to Julius in order to negotiate a settlement. The terms insisted on by the Pope were harsh: the Republic lost her traditional power to appoint clergy in her territory, {{as well as all}} jurisdiction over Papal subjects in Venice, the Romagnan cities that had prompted the war were to be returned to Julius, and reparations were to be paid to cover his expenses in capturing them. The Senate argued over the terms for two months, but finally accepted them on February 24, 1510. Even before the Venetian ambassadors had presented themselves to Julius for absolution, however, the Council of Ten had privately resolved that the terms had been accepted under duress and were therefore invalid, and that Venice should violate them at the earliest opportunity.|$|E

5000|$|To <b>send</b> <b>a</b> [...] "1", the {{bus master}} <b>sends</b> <b>a</b> very brief (1-15 µs) low pulse. To <b>send</b> <b>a</b> [...] "0", the master <b>sends</b> <b>a</b> 60 µs low pulse. The falling (negative) {{edge of the}} pulse is used to start a {{monostable}} multivibrator in the slave device. The multivibrator in the slave clocks to read the data line about 30 µs after the falling edge. The slave's multivibrator unavoidably has analog tolerances that affect its timing accuracy, {{which is why the}} [...] "0" [...] pulses have to be 60 µs long, and the [...] "1" [...] pulses can't be longer than 15 µs.|$|R
30|$|BFD {{transmission}} occurs between AP and one FDN {{when they}} have data for each other. In this case, either AP or an FDN wins in the contention period and <b>sends</b> <b>an</b> RTSD. For example, AP <b>sends</b> <b>an</b> RTSD with a DI value of 11 to an FDN. The corresponding FDN also <b>sends</b> <b>a</b> CTSD with a DI value of 11 because the FDN has data for AP. BFD transmission then occurs.|$|R
5|$|Holden {{claimed his}} first aerial victory while No.2 Squadron was still flying DH.5s, before it began {{converting}} to Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5s in December 1917. On 18 February 1918, he shared {{in one of}} the unit's first two victories in the S.E.5, helping <b>send</b> <b>an</b> Albatros down in a spin. He claimed another three aircraft shot down over the following month, giving him a total of five victories. At least one of these took place during the Spring Offensive, on 22 March, when all available Allied aircraft were thrown into battle to stem the German advance.|$|E
5|$|Josip Broz Tito and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, then {{located in}} Zagreb, {{along with the}} Central Committee of the Communist Party of Croatia, sent a {{delegation}} to 4th Army headquarters in Bjelovar urging them to issue arms to workers to help defend Zagreb. Pavle Gregorić, {{who was a member}} of both Central Committees, went to the headquarters twice, and was able to speak briefly with Nedeljković, but could not convince him to do so. On the same day, Maček, who had returned to Zagreb after briefly joining the post-Yugoslav coup d'état government of Dušan Simović, agreed to <b>send</b> <b>an</b> emissary to the 108th Infantry Regiment urging them to obey their officers, but they did not respond to his appeal.|$|E
5|$|Over the winter, {{there seems}} to have been some tension between the Allies. In particular, the Athenians, who were not {{protected}} by the isthmus, but whose fleet were the key to the security of the Peloponnesus, felt hard done by. They demanded an Allied army march north the following year. When the other Allies failed to commit to this, the Athenian fleet probably refused to join the Allied navy in the spring. The navy, now under the command of the Spartan king Leotychides, thus skulked off Delos, while the remnants of the Persian fleet skulked off Samos, both sides unwilling to risk battle. Similarly, Mardonius remained in Thessaly, knowing an attack on the isthmus was pointless, while the Allies refused to <b>send</b> <b>an</b> army outside the Peloponessus.|$|E

5|$|The Albanian–Venetian War of 1447–48 was waged between Venetian and Ottoman forces {{against the}} Albanians under George Kastrioti Skanderbeg. The war {{was the result}} of a dispute between the Republic and the Dukagjini family over the {{possession}} of the Dagnum fortress. Skanderbeg, then ally of the Dukagjini family, moved against several Venetian held towns along the Albanian coastline, in order to pressure the Venetians into restoring Dagnum. In response, the Republic sent a local force to relieve the besieged fortress of Dagnum, and urged the Ottoman Empire to <b>send</b> <b>an</b> expeditionary force into Albania. At that time the Ottomans were already besieging the fortress of Svetigrad, stretching Skanderbeg's efforts thin.|$|E
