5|$|Following {{accusations of}} forced labour {{on the large}} American-owned Firestone rubber {{plantation}} and American accusations of slave trading, the Liberian government asked the League to launch an investigation. The resulting commission was jointly appointed by the League, the United States, and Liberia. In 1930, a League report confirmed the presence of <b>slavery</b> <b>and</b> forced labour. The report implicated many government officials in the selling of contract labour and recommended that they be replaced by Europeans or Americans, which generated anger within Liberia {{and led to the}} resignation of President Charles D.

60|$|Now {{there we}} have {{instances}} of three prominent ostensible civilisations working the silent-assertion lie. Could one find other instances {{in the three}} countries? I think so. Not so very many perhaps, but say a billion--just so as to keep within bounds. Are those countries working that kind of lie, {{day in and day}} out, in thousands and thousands of varieties, without ever resting? Yes, we know that to be true. The universal conspiracy of the silent-assertion lie is hard at work always and everywhere, and always in the interest of a stupidity or a sham, never in the interest of a thing fine or respectable. Is it the most timid and shabby of all lies? It seems to have the look of it. For ages and ages it has mutely laboured in the interest of despotisms and aristocracies <b>and</b> chattel <b>slaveries,</b> <b>and</b> military <b>slaveries,</b> <b>and</b> religious <b>slaveries,</b> <b>and</b> has kept them alive; keeps them alive yet, here and there and yonder, all about the globe; and will go on keeping them alive until the silent-assertion lie retires from business--the silent assertion that nothing is going on which fair and intelligent men are aware of and are engaged by their duty to try to stop.|$|R

5|$|A {{large-scale}} {{slave trade}} with English privateers was begun. The {{life expectancy of}} slaves was much higher in North America than further south, because of less disease and better food and treatment, leading to a rapid increase {{in the numbers of}} slaves. Colonial society was largely divided over the religious and moral implications of <b>slavery</b> <b>and</b> colonies passed acts for and against the practice. But {{by the turn of the}} 18th century, African slaves were replacing indentured servants for cash crop labor, especially in southern regions.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{growing up}} in a slaveholding area, Daniel was an {{abolitionist}} and joined with the majority at the convention in voting to outlaw <b>slavery</b> <b>and</b> disenfranchise those who had fought for the Confederacy in the Civil War. In 1866, Daniel argued in court that state laws enforcing racial distinctions were no longer valid after the passage of the recent federal Civil Rights Act. The court ruled in his favor, holding that the law could not treat black and white apprentices differently. Later that year, Daniel ran unsuccessfully for a judgeship on the state equity court.|$|E

5|$|In 1939, the Department of Justice {{created the}} Civil Rights Section, which focused {{primarily}} on First Amendment and labor rights.

By 1860, almost half a million people, roughly 31% of the total population of Virginia, were enslaved. This division contributed {{to the start of the}} American Civil War.|$|E
