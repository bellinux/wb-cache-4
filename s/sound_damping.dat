40|$|Schlauch et al. (2001) {{found that}} ramped tones (gradual attack and abrupt decay) of 10, 25, 50, 100, 200 ms were {{perceived}} as shorter than damped tones (abrupt attack and gradual decay) of the same physical duration. The size of this temporal asymmetry, in percent, depends on the overall duration of the sound: the longer the sound the smaller the asymmetry. In our first experiment listeners were asked to adjust the duration of a constant level sound in order to match the duration of either a similar sound, a ramped <b>sound</b> or a <b>damped</b> <b>sound</b> of 250, 500, 750 or 1000 ms of duration. Ramped and <b>damped</b> <b>sounds</b> were both modulated in amplitude with a raised cosine function. The results, extended to longer durations, confirmed what was previously found by Schlauch et al. : {{the duration of the}} <b>damped</b> <b>sounds</b> was systematically underestimated compared to the duration of the ramped sounds. Furthermore, the duration of ramped sounds was slightly underestimated compared to the duration of the steady sounds. In a second experiment, the same phenomena were investigated with a reaction time task. Subjects were asked to react to either the onset or the offset of the target sounds used in the first experiment so that the perceived duration could be calculated as the difference between two reaction times. Results demonstrated that, the delay in the reaction times to the onset of the periodic ramped sounds could explain their underestimation, but the anticipation of the offset of a <b>damped</b> <b>sounds</b> was too small to explain their underestimation. The results of the current research do not support the predictions of the AIM model (Patterson & Irino, 1998).

40|$|Starting from a nonmarkovian conserving {{relaxation}} time approximation for collisions we derive coupled dispersion relations for asymmetric nuclear matter.

Solid wood doors are a better sound barrier than hollow doors. Curtains {{can be used to}} damp sound either through use of heavy materials or through the use of air chambers known as honeycombs. Single-, double- and triple-honeycomb designs achieve relatively greater degrees of <b>sound</b> <b>damping.</b> The primary soundproofing limit of curtains is the lack of a seal {{at the edge of the}} curtain, although this may be alleviated with the use of sealing features, such as hook and loop fastener, adhesive, magnets, or other materials.

50|$|<b>Sound</b> <b>damping</b> {{tapes and}} other {{materials}} {{have been used to}} reduce both vibration and sound transmission through materials since the early 1930s. Although the applications of <b>sound</b> <b>damping</b> was largely limited to defense and industrial applications such as naval vessels and aircraft in the past, recent research has proven the effectiveness of damping in interior sound isolation in buildings. Constrained-layer damping gypsum wallboard panels increase sound isolation in building partitions by drastically reducing the vibration of panels and, incidentally, the radiation of sound through panels. The shear loading of a highly visco-elastic interlayer sandwiched between two more rigid constraining layers causes decreased displacement due to vibration, reducing the amount of sound energy radiated through a panel between enclosures. Damped gypsum wallboard panels are effective in reducing sound transmission over a broad range of frequencies and especially useful for achieving high levels of speech privacy between partitions.|$|E

40|$|National audienceIt {{has been}} shown in the past that {{listeners}} judge differently the loudness change of sounds that increase or decrease in levels for the same physical variation. Different results were found concerning the direction of this asymmetry. It {{has been shown}} that loudness change measurement is strongly dependent on the procedure used: direct or indirect estimations. Direct estimation is mainly influenced by the global loudness of the sound (see co-submitted work). As a result, loudness change estimated by a direct procedure is greater for a ramped sound and remains whatever is the location in level. For indirect estimations, results are different and less obvious. In the present work, indirect estimations consisted in measuring the loudness {{at the end of the}} varying-level sounds using magnitude estimation for 1 -kHz tones, synthetic vowel sounds and white noises. The loudness change was defined as the ratio between the loudness estimated at the end of the varying sound and the loudness at its start level. The latter originated from the loudness function measured for stationary sounds. Indirect estimation of loudness change is greater for ramped than for <b>damped</b> <b>sounds.</b> Contrary to the result obtained with direct estimation, the difference between ramped and <b>damped</b> <b>sounds</b> decreased as the location in level of the variation increased; for variations in the more intense levels, the inverse effect was observed. In most conditions, the loudness at the end of the <b>sounds</b> (ramped or <b>damped)</b> was overestimated compared to the loudness of an equivalent steady state sound. As a result, the ratio (end loudness) /(start loudness) of ramped sounds was, most of time, greater than this ratio for <b>damped</b> <b>sounds.</b> These data showed that the estimation at the end of a sound increasing or decreasing in level explain the asymmetry obtained when measuring loudness changes of ramped and <b>damped</b> <b>sounds</b> indirectly...|$|R

Metallic foams in hollow car parts decrease weakness points usually associated with car crashes and vibration. These foams are inexpensive to cast with powder metallurgy, compared to casting other hollow parts.|$|E

40|$|The {{association}} between temporal-masking patterns, duration, and loudness for broadband noises with ramped and damped envelopes was examined. Duration and loudness matches between the ramped and <b>damped</b> <b>sounds</b> differed significantly. Listeners perceived the ramped stimuli to be longer and {{louder than the}} damped stimuli, but the outcome was biased by the stimulus context. Next, temporal-masking patterns were measured for ramped- and damped-broadband noises using three (0. 5, 1. 5, and 4. 0 kHz) 10 ms probe tones presented individually at various temporal delays. Predictions of subjective duration derived from masking results underpredicted the matching results. Loudness estimates derived from models that assume persistence of neural activity after stimulus offset [Glasberg B. R., and Moore, B. C. J. (2002). “A model of loudness applicable to time-varying sounds,” J. Audio. Eng. Soc. 50, 331 – 341; Chalupper, J., and Fastl, H.
