The decontamination and <b>decommissioning</b> (D&D) <b>of</b> nuclear reactors is an area of common interest in both the commercial electric utility industry and in the DOE complex. The nuclear utility industry has a number of commercial nuclear plants in various <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>decommissioning</b> – pre-shutdown planning, deactivation, decontamination, partial dismantlement, or completed demolition to a brown-field or green-field condition. The DOE EM Program has a number of shutdown reactors ready for D&D, including eight of the nine shutdown plutonium production reactors on the Hanford Site. In 1998, the DOE Office of Procurement and Assistance Management, in conjunction with the DOE Contractor Purchasing Council (CPC), conducted a benchmarking study to identify best commercial procurement practices that could be applied to DOE D&D projects.

This decision laid down the foundations for the UKAEA to focus firmly on the task <b>of</b> <b>decommissioning</b> the UKAEA’s site at Dounreay. Fifty to sixty years has been identified as the period in which to decommission the site and restore its environment. The business <b>of</b> <b>decommissioning</b> at Dounreay presents a number of interesting challenges that need to be addressed. There are a number of complex and unique projects that must be undertaken including the <b>decommissioning</b> <b>of</b> the early fast reactors, a materials test reactor, metallurgical laboratories (housing fume cupboards, glove boxes and shielded cells) and novel fuel reprocessing plants. This paper discusses the experience gained during the various <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>decommissioning</b> in the fast reactors and nuclear fuel cycle reprocessing plants, focusing on the Dounreay Fast Reactor, the Prototype Fast Reactor, a criticality test facility, fuel reprocessing plants, laboratories and associated environment.

40|$|During BN- 350 reactor {{operations}} and also {{during the initial}} <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>decommissioning,</b> cesium traps were used to decontaminate the reactor’s primary sodium coolant. Two different types of carbon-based trap were used – the MAVR series, low ash granulated graphite adsorber (LAG) contained in a carrier designed to be inserted into the reactor core during shutdown; {{and a series of}} ex-reactor trap accumulators(TAs) which used reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) to reduce Cs- 137 levels in the sodium after final reactor shutdown. In total four MAVRs and seven TAs were used at BN- 350 to remove an estimated cumulative 755 TBq of cesium. The traps, which also contain residual sodium, need to be immobilized in an appropriate way to allow them to be consigned as waste packages for long term storage and, ultimately, disposal. The present paper reports on the current status of the implementation phase, with particular reference to the work done to date on the trap accumulators, which have the most similarity with the cesium traps used at other reactors...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this NUREG is to {{establish}} the feasibility of developing a risk-informed and performance-based regulatory structure for the licensing of future nuclear power plants (NPPs). As such, this NUREG documents a “Framework ” that provides an approach, scope and criteria {{that could be used}} to develop a set of requirements that would serve as an alternative to 10 CFR 50 for licensing future NPPs; however, this Framework is not the entire process. It is an initial phase in is to demonstrate the feasibility of such a concept, recognizing that for full implementation there will be outstanding programmatic, policy, and technical issues to be resolved. As such, this feasibility study does not represent a staff position, but rather a significant piece of research. The second phase, which involves implementation, is comprised of several, iterative steps: resolution of issues, development of draft requirements and regulations, pilots and tests, and rulemaking. The information contained in this NUREG is intended for use by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) staff in developing requirements applicable to the licensing of commercial NPPs.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present a possible solution for the designing of a device for the <b>decommissioning</b> <b>of</b> the horizontal fuel channels in the CANDU 6 nuclear reactor. The decommissioning activities are dismantling, demolition, controlled removal of equipment, components, conventional or hazardous waste (radioactive, toxic) in compliance with the international basic safety standards on radiation protection. One as the most important operation in the final phase of the nuclear reactor dismantling is the <b>decommissioning</b> <b>of</b> fuel channels. For the fuel channels decommissioning should be taken into account the detailed description of the fuel channel and its components, the installation documents history, adequate radiological criteria for decommissioning guidance, safety and environmental impact assessment, including radiological and non-radiological analysis of the risks that can occur for workers, public and environment, the description of the proposed program for decommissioning the fuel channel and its components, the description of the quality assurance program and of the monitoring program, the equipments and methods used to verify the compliance with the decommissioning criteria, the planning of performing the final radiological assessment at the end of the fuel channel decommissioning. These will include also, a description of the proposed radiation protection procedures to be used during <b>decommissioning.</b> The dismantling <b>of</b> the fuel channel is performed by one device which shall provide radiation protection during the <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>decommissioning,</b> ensuring radiation protection of the workers.

40|$|As DOE dismantles {{its nuclear}} {{processing}} facilities, site managers must employ {{the best means}} of disposing or remediating {{hundreds of miles of}} potentially contaminated piping and duct work. Their interiors are difficult to access, and in many cases even the exteriors are inaccessible. Without adequate characterization, it must be assumed that the piping is contaminated, and the disposal cost of buried drain lines can be on the order of $ 1, 200 /ft and is often unnecessary as residual contamination levels often are below free release criteria. This paper describes the program to develop {{a solution to the problem}} of characterizing radioactive contamination in pipes.

The heart of the system is SEA`s pressurized inverting membrane adapted to transport radiation detectors and other tools into pipes. It offers many benefits over other pipe inspection approaches.

40|$|As {{offshore}} installations in the North Sea {{near the end}} of their economically viable life they will be decommissioned. There is limited experience <b>of</b> <b>decommissioning</b> the structures in the Northern North Sea. When decommissioning is being considered studies are undertaken to assess each option on such criteria as: environmental impact, technical feasibility, cost, health and safety and public acceptability. This thesis aims to explore the contribution that economics can make to the debate surrounding decommissioning with the introduction of a cost benefit analysis framework within which to compare each decommissioning option. Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) considers the economic costs and benefits from any change in resource allocation within an economy. This would provide a structured assessment of all the impacts <b>of</b> <b>decommissioning</b> in monetary terms. CBA also allows social desirability to be considered. The CBA framework involves valuing costs and benefits. Whilst estimating costs raises important questions, the identification, measurement and valuation of (dis) benefits represents one the greatest challenges facing economists. This thesis will focus on how economics can be applied to this problem to obtain monetary valuations of the benefits <b>of</b> <b>decommissioning.</b> Two methods <b>of</b> valuing the (dis) benefits <b>of</b> <b>decommissioning</b> are considered - Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) and Discrete Choice Experiments (DCE). These are applied to valuing of one impact <b>of</b> <b>decommissioning</b> (drill cuttings) and the value <b>of</b> alternative <b>decommissioning</b> policies. As well as addressing the issue <b>of</b> <b>decommissioning,</b> these experiments also consider methodological issues in the application of CVM (dealing with Don't Know and Protest responses) and DCE (testing for compensatory decision making). Following this the costs <b>of</b> <b>decommissioning</b> are estimated using an existing financial simulation model developed for oil industry use.
