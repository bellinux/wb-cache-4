5|$|Goldenheart is an {{eccentric}} R album that draws on dream pop, alternative, and dance genres. Its mostly midtempo songs have strong grooves and feature synthesizers, string settings, vintage keyboards, {{and an array}} of percussive <b>sounds.</b> <b>A</b> post-breakup concept album, Richard's songwriting poses relationships and personal subjects as epic tales through magical, medieval imagery and allusions to high fantasy and science fiction tropes.|$|E
5|$|Some English {{surnames}} {{from the}} Middle Ages name animals. These have different origins. Some, like Pigg (1066), Hogg (1079) and Hoggard, Hogarth (1279) are metonyms for a swineherd, while Oxer (1327) similarly denotes an oxherd and Shepherd (1279 onwards) means as it <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> herder of sheep.|$|E

5|$|Greer Stadium {{was home}} to a rare {{baseball}} occurrence on August 6 and August 7, 1988, when Nashville and Indianapolis exchanged no-hitters on back-to-back nights. First, Indianapolis' Randy Johnson and Pat Pacillo combined for a no-hit loss against the <b>Sounds,</b> <b>a</b> 1–0Nashville win. That game was won by Nashville when Lenny Harris walked to first base, stole second base, stole third base, and then came home, scoring on a groundout. The next night, Nashville's Jack Armstrong pitched a no-hit game against the Indians, a 4–0Sounds victory. This {{was the first time}} in American Association history that teams played in back-to-back no-hit games, and was the third no-hitter in Sounds franchise history.|$|E

5|$|Organ stops can be {{combined}} in countless permutations, resulting in {{a great variety of}} <b>sounds.</b> <b>A</b> combination action can be used to switch instantly from one combination of stops (called a registration) to another. Combination actions feature small buttons called pistons that can be pressed by the organist, generally located beneath the keys of each manual (thumb pistons) or above the pedalboard (toe pistons). The pistons may be divisional (affecting only a single division) or general (affecting all the divisions), and are either preset by the organ builder or can be altered by the organist. Modern combination actions operate via computer memory, and can store several channels of registrations.|$|E

Human screams and a donkey screech were mixed into Sauron's fall and broken glass was used for the collapsing sounds. For missile trading during Minas Tirith's siege, construction workers dropped actual 2 ton stone blocks previously lifted by a construction crane. Mixing began at a new studio on 15 August, although unfinished building work caused some annoyances. The mixers finished on 15 November, after three months of non-stop work.|$|E
25|$|Skrol is a Czech avant-garde martial {{industrial}} {{band from}} Prague formed in 1995, active until 2004 and rejoined again in 2010. It consists of composer and keyboard player Vladimír Hirsch, singer Martina Sanollová and a non performing member, Tom Saivon, who provides noise structures and lyrics. The music {{is based on}} integration of neoclassical compositional principles into industrial structures, with heavy martial rhythms, symphonic arrangement of electronics, classical organ, strings and brasses. The intense atmosphere is crowned by the ecstatic and extremely igneous expression of the singer. This Czech trio has entered {{into the history of}} European avant-garde, combining military beats, industrial aesthetics, orchestral <b>sounds,</b> <b>a</b> rock formula and Slavic harmonies.|$|E

25|$|It {{may also}} be a result of tensing of the chordae tendineae during rapid filling and {{expansion}} of the ventricle. In other words, an S3 heart sound indicates increased volume of blood within the ventricle. An S3 heart sound is best heard with the bell-side of the stethoscope (used for lower frequency <b>sounds).</b> <b>A</b> left-sided S3 is best heard in the left lateral decubitus position and at the apex of the heart, which is normally located in the 5th left intercostal space at the midclavicular line. A right-sided S3 is best heard at the lower-left sternal border. The way to distinguish between a left and right-sided S3 is to observe whether it increases in intensity with inhalation or exhalation. A right-sided S3 will increase on inhalation, while a left-sided S3 will increase on exhalation.|$|E
