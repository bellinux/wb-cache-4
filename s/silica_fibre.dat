50|$|Doped fibre {{amplifiers}} (DFAs) are optical amplifiers {{that use}} a doped optical fibre as a gain medium to amplify an optical signal. They {{are related to}} fibre lasers. The signal to be amplified and a pump laser are multiplexed into the doped fibre, and the signal is amplified through interaction with the doping ions. The most common example is the Erbium Doped Fibre Amplifier (EDFA), where {{the core of a}} <b>silica</b> <b>fibre</b> is doped with trivalent erbium ions and can be efficiently pumped with a laser at a wavelength of 980 nm or 1,480 nm, and exhibits gain in the 1,550 nm region.|$|E

Polymer fiber Bragg {{gratings}} - Prior to {{the commencement}} of PHOSFOS, gratings in polymer optical fibre (POF) only existed in the 1550 nm spectral region where the large fibre loss (1 dB/cm) only permitted very short (<10 cm) fibre lengths to be used and the devices had to be butt-coupled to a silica fiber pigtail on the optical bench. The PHOSFOS consortium has developed a means for reliably splicing POF to <b>silica</b> <b>fibre</b> and produced the first gratings in the 800 nm spectral region where losses are almost 2 orders of magnitude less than at 1550 nm. These developments have allowed POF grating sensors to be used outside the laboratory for the first time.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{literature}} {{has suggested that}} many commercially important plant species contain amorphous silica. This report provides a summary of that literature {{as well as the}} findings from a field survey in Florida of sugar-cane field workers where airborne concentrations of amorphous <b>silica</b> <b>fibres</b> were determined. In addition to the fibre analysis, concentrations of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and total airborne dust were also determined. It was confirmed that biogenic amorphous <b>silica</b> <b>fibres</b> exist in the mature sugar-cane leafand that these fibres become airborne during the manual harvesting of the cane after the leaf is burned. Airborne amorphous <b>silica</b> <b>fibres</b> that were found were 3. 5 - 65;im long (mean = 12;im) with an average diameter of 0. 6 /im. Air concentrations were calculated to be as high as 300 000 fibres m " 3 of air during cane cutting. Some PAH compounds were found to be present in the burnt leaf but the concentrations were below the limits of detection in the air. The health significance of these findings to sugar-cane workers as well as to other agricultural workers is discussed...|$|R
50|$|Advances {{made during}} the 1980s meant that it had become clear that to get the {{broadest}} continua in fibre, it was most efficient to pump in the anomalous dispersion regime. However {{it was difficult to}} capitalise upon this with high power 1 μm lasers as it had proven extremely difficult to achieve a zero dispersion wavelength of much less than 1.3 μm in conventional <b>silica</b> <b>fibre.</b> A solution appeared with the invention of Photonic-crystal fibers (PCF) in 1996 by Knight et al. The properties of PCFs are discussed in detail elsewhere, but they have two properties which make PCF an excellent medium for supercontinuum generation, namely: high nonlinearity and a customisable zero dispersion wavelength. Amongst the first was Ranka et al. in 2000, who used a 75 cm PCF with a zero dispersion at 767 nm and a 1.7 μm core diameter. They pumped the fibre with 100 fs, 800 pJ pulses at 790 nm to produce a flat continuum from between 400 and 1450 nm.|$|E
5000|$|The {{study of}} atomic vapours, organic vapours and liquids by Raman {{absorption}} spectroscopy through the 1960s and 1970s drove {{the development of}} continua sources. By the early 1970s, continua formed by nanosecond duration flash lamps and laser-triggered breakdown spark in gases, along with laser excited fluorescence continua from scintillator dyes, were being used to study the excited states. These sources all had problems; what was required was a source that produced broad continua at high power levels with a reasonable efficiency. In 1976 Lin and Stolen reported a new nanosecond source that produced continua with a bandwidth of 110-180 nm centred on 530 nm at output powers of around a kW. The system used a 10-20 kW dye laser producing 10 ns pulses with 15-20 nm of bandwidth to pump a 19.5 m long, 7 μm core diameter <b>silica</b> <b>fibre</b> [...] They could only manage a coupling efficiency {{in the region of}} 5-10%.|$|E
50|$|In 1987 Gomes et al. {{reported}} cascaded stimulated Raman scattering in {{a single}} mode phosphosilicate based fibre. They pumped the fibre with a Q-switched and mode-locked Nd:YAG, which produced 130 ps pulses with 700 kW peak power. They launched up to 56 kW into the fibre {{and as a result}} of the phosphorus achieved a much broader and flatter continuum than had been achieved to that point with <b>silica</b> <b>fibre.</b> A year later Gouveia-Neto et al. from the same group published a paper describing the formation and propagation of soliton waves from modulation instability. They used a 1.32 μm Nd:YAG laser which produced 100 ps pulses with 200 W peak power to pump 500 m of single mode fibre with a 7 μm core diameter. The zero dispersion wavelength of the fibre was at 1.30 μm, placing the pump just inside the anomalous dispersion regime. They noted pulses emerging with durations of less than 500 fs (solitons) and as they increased the pump power a continuum was formed stretching from 1.3 to 1.5 μm.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} for fibre optic based sensing is robust operation in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) region. This is of major interest because this wavelength region is where the characteristic absorption spectra {{for a wide range}} of molecules lie. However, due to the high absorption of silica (above 2 μm), mid-IR sensors based on solid core <b>silica</b> <b>fibres</b> are not practical. Of the many alternatives to solid <b>silica</b> <b>fibres,</b> hollow core microstrutured optical fibres are being explored and show great promise. One relatively new fibre, the hollow core negative curvature fibre (NCF) is promising for novel optical devices due to the simple structure (in comparison to other microstructured fibres) in combination with a hollow core which enables low loss mid-IR infrared guidance in a <b>silica</b> based <b>fibre.</b> In this paper, an all silica NCF that is post-processed with a fs laser, in order to increase access to the hollow core, is presented with acceptable loss and significant potential for mid-IR gas sensing...|$|R

5000|$|One of {{the early}} results from the project was the {{successful}} demonstration of a repeatable method of joining the polymer fiber to standard <b>silica</b> <b>fibre.</b> This was a major development and allowed {{for the first time}} POF Bragg gratings to be used in real applications outside of the optics lab. One of the first uses for these sensors was in monitoring the strain of tapestries shown in Figure 4,. In this case conventional electrical strain sensors and silica fiber sensors were shown to be strengthening the tapestries in areas where they were fixed. Because the polymer devices are much more flexible they do not distort the material as much and therefore give a much most accurate measurement of the strain in flexible materials. Temperature and humidity sensing using a combined silica / POF fiber sensor has been demonstrated. [...] Combined strain, temperature and bend sensing has also been shown. Using a fiber Bragg grating in an eccentric core polymer has been shown to yield a high sensitivity to bend.|$|E
5000|$|By 1978 Lin and Nguyen {{reported}} several continua, {{most notably}} one stretching from 0.7-1.6 μm using a 315 m long GeO doped <b>silica</b> <b>fibre</b> with a 33 μm core. The optical setup {{was similar to}} Lin's previous work with Stolen, except in this instance the pump source was a 150 kW, 20 ns, Q-switched Nd:YAG laser. Indeed, they had so much power available to them that two thirds was attenuated away to prevent damage to the fibre. The 50 kW coupled into the fibre emerged as a 12 kW continuum [...] Stokes lines were clearly visible up to 1.3 μm, {{at which point the}} continuum began to smooth out, except for a large loss due to water absorption at 1.38 μm. As they increased the launch power beyond 50 kW they noted that the continuum extends down into the green part of the visible spectrum. However, the higher power levels quickly damaged their fibre. In the same paper they also pumped a single mode fibre with a 6 μm core diameter and [...] "a few 100 m in length." [...] It generated a similar continuum spanning from 0.9 μm to 1.7 μm with reduced launch and output powers. Without realising it, they had also generated optical solitons for the first time.|$|E
