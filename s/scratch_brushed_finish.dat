50|$|A <b>brushed</b> <b>finish</b> is {{susceptible}} to damage. <b>Brushed</b> <b>finishes</b> also typically have a detrimental effect on corrosion resistance. In particular the brushed texture limits the ability of fluid to bead on the material surface. In the case of stainless steel the grooves of the finish can accumulate chloride ions which break down the chromium oxide passivation layer, enabling rusting to occur.|$|R

When the mercury has evaporated, which is known by the surface having entirely become of a dull yellow color, the metal must undergo other operations, by which the fine gold color is given to it. First, the gilded surface is rubbed with a <b>scratch</b> <b>brush</b> of brass wire, until its surface is smooth.|$|R

2500|$|For platinum, gold, {{and silver}} jewellery, {{there are many}} {{techniques}} to create finishes. The most common are high-polish, satin/matte, brushed, and hammered. High-polished jewellery {{is the most common}} and gives the metal a highly reflective, shiny look. Satin, or matte finish reduces the shine and reflection of the jewellery, and this is commonly used to accentuate gemstones such as diamonds. <b>Brushed</b> <b>finishes</b> give the jewellery a textured look and are created by brushing a material (similar to sandpaper) against the metal, leaving [...] "brush strokes". Hammered finishes are typically created by using a rounded steel hammer and hammering the jewellery to give it a wavy texture.|$|R

40|$|Layered {{composite}} materials {{have become an}} increasingly interesting topic in industrial development. Cold roll bonding (CRB), as a solid phase method of bonding same or different metals by rolling at room temperature, has been widely used in manufacturing large layered composite sheets and foils. In this paper, we provide {{a brief overview of}} a technology using layered {{composite materials}} produced by CRB and discuss the suitability of this technology in the fabrication of layered composite materials. The effects of process parameters on bonding, mainly including process and surface preparation conditions, have been analyzed. Bonding between two sheets can be realized when deformation reduction reaches a threshold value. However, it is essential to remove surface contamination layers to produce a satisfactory bond in CRB. It has been suggested that the degreasing and then <b>scratch</b> <b>brushing</b> of surfaces create a strong bonding between the layers. Bonding mechanisms, in which the film theory is expressed as the major mechanism in CRB, as well as bonding theoretical models, have also been reviewed. It has also been showed that it is easy for fcc structure metals to bond compared with bcc and hcp structure metals. In addition, hardness on bonding same metals plays an important part in CRB. Applications of composites produced by CRB in industrial fields are briefly reviewed and possible developments of CRB in the future are also described...|$|R

2500|$|Eventually, it {{was decided}} to {{standardise}} on a colour which became known as Rail Blue. Introduced in 1965, and also known as [...] "Monastral Blue", the colour was defined by British Standards BR28/6001 (Airless spray <b>finish)</b> and BR28/5321 (<b>Brush</b> <b>finish).</b> [...] It was a dark, greyish blue tone which hid the effects of dirt well. The colour often appears inaccurately in photographs, generally appearing brighter and bluer than the real colour. In the early years the colour faded quite badly, becoming lighter and paler with time although this problem had been overcome by the late 1970s. United Kingdom paint code RAL5020 ("Ocean Blue") is a good match to Rail Blue. There is also a British Standard paint colour BS381C 114 called Rail Blue which was introduced in 1964. The new British Rail [...] "double arrow" [...] symbol on locomotives (or leading vehicle as was the case on multiple unit stock) and the vehicle number and other ancillary markings written in the Rail Alphabet typeface were other integral parts of the livery.|$|R
40|$|AbstractSolid bonding of {{aluminium}} {{is an important}} joining technology with applications in fabrication, forming and new low-carbon recycling routes. The influence of deformation conditions {{on the strength of}} the resulting weld has yet to be fully assessed, preventing optimization of current processes and development of new ones. In this work, an extensive literature review identifies the deformation parameters important to weld strength: interface strain, strain rate, normal contact stress, temperature and shear. The film theory of bonding is used to derive a model that quantifies the relevance of these parameters to the weld strength. This model is then evaluated using an experiment in which the interface strain and normal contact stress are decoupled, and the friction hills between both the tooling and the samples and between the samples themselves minimized. Neither the model nor the experiments deal with samples that have undergone mechanical surface preparation (for example, <b>scratch</b> <b>brushing)</b> prior to bonding. The experiments show that a minimum strain is required for bonding. Increasing the temperature, normal contact stress or shear stress can reduce this minimum strain. A normal contact stress above the materials’ uniaxial yield stress is necessary to produce a strong bond. Increasing the strain rate has little affect on the weld strength for bonds created at low temperatures, but can significantly reduce the strength of bonds created at higher temperatures. The proposed model correctly predicts these trends; however, for higher temperatures it underestimates bond strengths and the influence of strain rate, suggesting that diffusion mechanisms increase the strength of bonds created at higher temperatures...|$|R

40|$|Machining of {{components}} like grinding, turning, shot peening, work hardening, diamond burnishing and power <b>brush</b> <b>finishing</b> {{as well as}} thermal treatments such as laser-, induction- and case hardening or nitriding change the microstructure and the residual stress state in surface layers up to approximately one millimeter of depth. Nondestructive techniques {{have the ability to}} characterize microstructure and residual stress in these layered structures and because of the numerous rather complex interactions with the material, multiparametrical strategies are applied. Using at least two, in major applications up to eight parameters derived from different micromagnetic quantities like Barkhausen noise, incremental permeability and tangential field strenght, satisfying results have been achieved. Investigations using mechanically machined components as well as those with laserhardened surfaces are performed. The results like the quantitative evaluation of the stress states, of the hardness va lues and of the depth of the hardened layers agree well with the results of x-ray and other conventional tests. In order to meet the requirements of applications under workshop conditions, a portable system (3 MA-PC) has been developed. Handy multiparameter probes are available to meet different geometrical conditions. Data acquisition and evaluation is supported by a PC with Window-surface to facilitate the application...|$|R

50|$|Aluminium, zinc, zirconium, and thorium promote {{precipitation}} hardening: manganese improves corrosion resistance; and tin improves castability. Aluminium is {{the most}} common alloying element. The numerals correspond to the rounded-off percentage of the two main alloy elements, proceeding alphabetically as compositions become standard. Temper designation is much the same {{as in the case of}} aluminium. Using -F, -O, -H1, -T4, -T5, and -T6.Sand permanent-mold, and die casting are all well developed for magnesium alloys, die casting being the most popular. Although magnesium is about twice as expensive as aluminium, its hot-chamber die-casting process is easier, more economical, and 40% to 50% faster than cold-chamber process required for aluminium. Forming behavior is poor at room temperature, but most conventional processes can be performed when the material is heated to temperatures of 450 - 700 F. As these temperatures are easily attained and generally do not require a protective atmosphere, many formed and drawn magnesium products are manufactured. The machinability of magnesium alloys is the best of any commercial metal, and in many applications, the savings in machining costs more than compensate for the increased cost of the material. It is necessary, however, to keep the tools sharp and to provide ample space for the chips. Magnesium alloys can be spot-welded nearly as easily as aluminium, but <b>scratch</b> <b>brushing</b> or chemical cleaning is necessary before the weld is formed. Fusion welding is carried out most easily by processes using an inert shielding atmosphere of argon or helium gas. Considerable misinformation exists regarding the fire hazard in processing magnesium alloys. It is true that magnesium alloys are highly combustible when in a finely divided form, such as powder or fine chips, and this hazard should never be ignored. Above 800 F, a non-combustible, oxygen-free atmosphere is required to suppress burning. Casting operations often require additional precautions because of the reactivity of magnesium with sand and water in sheet, bar, extruded or cast form; however, magnesium alloys present no real fire hazard.|$|R

The effect on the bond strength from the preparations parameters as degreasing agent, <b>scratch</b> <b>brushing</b> and exposure time for oxide growth is investigated in comparison to former studies. Further the effect of rolling speed and effect from contributing factors from the different testing methods is discussed. Three different methods for testing the bond strength are used.

The TBST is testing the direct bond strength with no peel or shear forces involved. It also only requires {{a fraction of the}} sample material for testing and any roll bonded sample is applicable for this test. These are the huge advantages with the test method. The test method is however still naive, and suffers from a series of challenges. The current test ranged is from 4 MPa to 40 MPa, but with potential for a large range expansion. Further are bond damaging effects, caused by the machining, reducing the accuracy of the measurements and compromising grooving; a measure taken for increasing the test range above 40 MPa. The strain rate at which the samples were tested, showed to have strong influence on the measured bond strength. Much higher than the effect of any work hardening on either of the alloys.
