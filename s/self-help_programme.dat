40|$|Background In {{order to}} reduce the high {{prevalence}} of depression, early interventions for people at risk of depression are warranted. This study evaluated the effectiveness of an early guided <b>self-help</b> <b>programme</b> based on acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) for reducing depressive symptomatology. Method Participants with mild to moderate depressive symptomatology were recruited from the general population and randomized to the <b>self-help</b> <b>programme</b> with extensive email support (n= 125), the <b>self-help</b> <b>programme</b> with minimal email support (n= 125) or to a waiting list control group (n= 126). Participants completed measures before and after the intervention to assess depression, anxiety, fatigue, experiential avoidance, positive mental health and mindfulness. Participants in the experimental conditions also completed these measures at a 3 -month follow-up. Results In the experimental conditions significant reductions in depression, anxiety, fatigue, experiential avoidance and improvements in positive mental health and mindfulness were found, compared with the waiting list condition (effect sizes Cohen's d= 0. 51 – 1. 00).

40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether {{an analysis of}} narrative style (word use and cross-clausal syntax) of patients with symptoms of generalised anxiety and depression disorders can help predict the likelihood of successful participation in guided self-help. Texts by 97 people who had made contact with a primary care mental health service were analysed. Outcome measures were completion of the guided <b>self-help</b> <b>programme,</b> and change in symptoms assessed by a standardised scale (CORE-OM). Regression analyses indicated that some aspects of participants' syntax helped to predict completion of the programme, and that aspects of syntax and word use helped to predict improvement of symptoms. Participants using non-ﬁnite complement clauses with above-average frequency were {{four times more likely}} to complete the programme (95 % conﬁdence interval 1. 4 to 11. 7) than other participants. Among those who completed, the use of causation words and complex syntax (adverbial clauses) predicted improvement, accounting for 50 % of the variation in well-being beneﬁt. These results suggest that the analysis of narrative style can provide useful information for assessing the likelihood of success of individuals participating in a mental health guided <b>self-help</b> <b>programme...</b>|$|E

However, {{little is known about}} what makes those interventions work. The current trial focuses on patient expectations as one common mechanism of change. The study examines whether patients' expectancy predicts outcome, adherence, and dropout in an unguided Internet-based <b>self-help</b> <b>programme</b> for SAD. Data of 109 participants in a 10 -week <b>self-help</b> <b>programme</b> for SAD were analysed. Social anxiety measures were administered prior to the intervention, at week 2, and after the intervention. Expectancy was assessed at week 2. Patient expectations were a significant predictor of change in social anxiety (β = -. 35 to -. 40, all p <. 003). Patient expectations also predicted treatment adherence (β =. 27, p =. 02). Patients with higher expectations showed more adherence and better outcome. Dropout was not predicted by expectations. The effect of positive expectations on outcome was mediated by early symptom change (from week 0 to week 2).

The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the self-help behaviour of individuals with eating disorders in an Internet-based <b>self-help</b> <b>programme</b> developed in the Asia-Pacific region and to determine their compliance with the programme. Background. Eating disorders represent a growing health problem affecting both Western and Asian countries. Without timely and adequate treatment, individuals with eating disorders are at risk of premature death. Self-help approaches for treating eating disorders offer therapeutic promise. Design. An open trial design was used. Method. This study, conducted from August 2006 -July 2011, included 280 participants recruited from outpatient eating disorder clinics and treatment units and through a university student newspaper and Internet websites. This open trial evaluated an Internet-based <b>self-help</b> <b>programme,</b> which included components on healthy eating, family education, health assessment, motivation enhancement, self-help strategies, and psychological health promotion. The progress of participants was followed up via monthly e-mails. A tracking system was implemented to determine their compliance with the programme. Findings. A small majority of the participants (56 · 9 %) were already undergoing treatment for their eating disorders. About 63 % (n= 176) demonstrated self-help behaviour, as manifested by their completion of health assessment questionnaires, involvement in motivation enhancement exercises, or the use of self-help strategies such as monitoring, normalizing eating behaviour, and stress management. Improvements were observed in their eating disorder psychopathology, motivational stage of change and psychological health from baseline to the 1 -month follow up. Conclusion.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purposes}} of this study were to evaluate the use of an online guided self-treatment programme for bulimia nervosa (BN) and to determine predictors of outcome. Data were collected in four European countries where the programme was simultaneously used. METHOD: One hundred and twenty-seven BN or subthreshold BN female patients (mean age of 24. 7 years) participated in a 4 -month intervention using a CBT based online-guided <b>self-help</b> <b>programme.</b> Contact during the treatment period included weekly e-mails with a coach. ASSESSMENT: Measures included the Eating Disorders Inventory- 2 (EDI- 2) and the Symptom Check List-Revised (SCL- 90 R). RESULTS: Severity of eating disorders symptoms and general psychopathology improved significantly. Twenty-three per cent of patients were symptom free at the end of treatment. The dropout rate was 25. 2 %. A better score of general psychological health was a predictor of a better outcome. CONCLUSIONS: This study encourages further developments and research on innovative therapy approaches, particularly for those disorders such as BN, with difficult therapy and unclear prognosis.

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine the {{effectiveness}} of an Internet-based clinician-assisted computerized cognitive behavioural therapy programme for social phobia. Method: A total of 105 individuals with social phobia were randomly assigned to a six-lesson cognitive behavioural treatment programme or to a waitlist control group. Treatment consisted of four components: six online lessons; homework assignments; participation in an online discussion forum; and regular email contact with a therapist. An intention-to-treat model was used for data analyses. Results: A total of 78 % of treatment group participants completed all lessons, and post-treatment data were obtained from 93 / 105 participants. Significant post-treatment differences between treatment and waitlist participants were found on two measures of symptoms of social phobia. Mean within- and between-group effect sizes (Cohen's d) for the primary social phobia outcome measures were 1. 15, and 0. 95, respectively.

In addition to the ethnographic justification of this theoretical construct that supports the existence of two opposed poles of constituting a spiritual self, I will adjoin the cultural relationship between spirituality and capitalism to the wider problem of secularization, by arguing that spirituality is a byproduct of late modernity and a leitmotif of the power technologies through which the neo-liberal subject is produced. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Cigarette {{smoking is}} a major risk factor for many chronic and fatal illnesses. Stopping smoking {{directly}} reduces those risks. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the effectiveness of a web-based interactive <b>self-help</b> <b>programme</b> for smoking cessation, known as the StopSite, by comparing it to an online self-help guide. Both interventions were based on cognitive-behavioural and self-control principles, but the former provided exercises, feedback and interactive features such as one-to-one chatrooms and a user forum, which facilitated mutual support and experience sharing. Methods and design We conducted a randomised controlled trial to compare the interactive intervention with the self-help guide. The primary outcome measure was prolonged abstinence from smoking. Secondary outcomes were point-prevalence abstinence, number of cigarettes smoked, and incidence of quit attempts reported at follow-up assessments. Follow-up assessments took place three and six months after a one-month grace period for starting the intervention after baseline. Analyses were based on intention-to-treat principles using a conservative imputation method for missing data, whereby non-responders were classified as smokers. Discussion The trial should add to the body of knowledge on the effectiveness of web-based self-help smoking cessation interventions. Effective web-based programmes can potentially help large numbers of smokers to quit, thus having a major public health impact. Trial registration ISRCTN 74423766 </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: Despite {{cognitive}} {{behavioural therapy}} (CBT) being regarded as the first-line treatment option for bulimia nervosa (BN), barriers such as its time-consuming and expensive nature limit patient access. In order to broaden treatment availability and affordability, the efficacy and convenience of CBT could be improved {{through the use of}} online treatments and selective emphasis on its most ‘potent’ components of which behavioural techniques form the focus. Method: Twenty-six individuals with BN were enrolled in an online CBT-based <b>self-help</b> <b>programme</b> and 17 completed four weeks of regular eating and food-monitoring using the online Food Diary tool. Participants were contacted for a weekly check-in phone call and had their bulimic symptom severity assessed at five time points (baseline and weeks 1 – 4). Results: There was a significant decrease in the frequency of self-reported objective binge episodes, associated loss of control and objective binge days reported between pre- and post-treatment measures. Significant improvements were also observed in most subscales of the Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire. Conclusion: This study provides encouraging preliminary evidence of the potential of behavioural techniques of online CBT in the treatment of BN. Online therapy with this focus is potentially a viable and practical form of treatment delivery in this illness group.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cigarette {{smoking is}} a major risk factor for many chronic and fatal illnesses. Stopping smoking {{directly}} reduces those risks. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the effectiveness of a web-based interactive <b>self-help</b> <b>programme</b> for smoking cessation, known as the StopSite, by comparing it to an online self-help guide. Both interventions were based on cognitive-behavioural and self-control principles, but the former provided exercises, feedback and interactive features such as one-to-one chatrooms and a user forum, which facilitated mutual support and experience sharing. METHODS AND DESIGN: We conducted a randomised controlled trial to compare the interactive intervention with the self-help guide. The primary outcome measure was prolonged abstinence from smoking. Secondary outcomes were point-prevalence abstinence, number of cigarettes smoked, and incidence of quit attempts reported at follow-up assessments. Follow-up assessments took place three and six months after a one-month grace period for starting the intervention after baseline. Analyses were based on intention-to-treat principles using a conservative imputation method for missing data, whereby non-responders were classified as smokers. DISCUSSION: The trial should add to the body of knowledge on the effectiveness of web-based self-help smoking cessation interventions. Effective web-based programmes can potentially help large numbers of smokers to quit, thus having a major public health impact. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN 7442376...|$|E
40|$|Background: Numerous {{studies suggest}} that Internet-based {{self-help}} treatments are effective in treating anxiety disorders. Trials evaluating such interventions differ in their screening procedures and {{in the amount of}} clinician contact in the diagnostic assessment phase. The present study evaluates the impact of a pre-treatment diagnostic interview on the outcome of an Internet-based treatment for Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD). Method: One hundred and nine participants seeking treatment for SAD were randomized to either an interview-group (IG, N = 53) or to a non-interview group (NIG, N = 56). All participants took part in the same 10 -week cognitive-behavioural unguided <b>self-help</b> <b>programme.</b> Before receiving access to the programme, participants of the IG underwent a structured diagnostic interview. Participants of the NIG started directly with the programme. Results: Participants in both groups showed significant and substantial improvement on social anxiety measures from pre- to post-assessment (d IG = 1. 30 - 1. 63; d NIG = 1. 00 - 1. 28) and from pre- to 4 -month follow-up assessment (d IG = 1. 38 - 1. 87; d NIG = 1. 10 - 1. 21). Significant between-groups effects in favour of the IG were found on secondary outcome measures of depression and general distress (d = 0. 18 - 0. 42). Conclusions: These findings suggest that Internet-based self-help is effective in treating SAD, whether or not a diagnostic interview is involved. However, the pre-treatment interview seems to facilitate change on secondary outcomes such as depression and general distres...|$|E
40|$|Background : The {{purpose of}} the study was to examine whether the {{addition}} of a brief individual self-help package to standard primary-care treatment of depression with antidepressants is associated with any additional improvements in clinical outcome. Method : Individuals with major depressive disorder who were prescribed an antidepressant were recruited through their general practitioner (GP) and allocated randomly to standard treatment alone or standard treatment plus self-help. Assessments of symptoms, social adjustment, global functioning, satisfaction with treatment and knowledge about the management of the disorder were completed at three time points over 26 weeks. Results : One hundred and twelve individuals agreed to participate and 96 met criteria for inclusion in the randomized controlled trial. Subjects in both treatment conditions improved substantially over the study period; the mean Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score fell from 27. 3 to 13. 9 in the intention-to-treat analysis. There were no between group differences in outcome on any of the primary outcome measures, nor did these approach even marginal significance. Patients and GPs were highly satisfied with the <b>self-help</b> <b>programme,</b> and the intervention as compared to the control group reported significantly greater improvements in knowledge about depression and satisfaction with information received about depression. Conclusions : An individualized self-help package improved perceived knowledge about depression but did not have identifiable effects on outcome when offered to patients treated in primary care. The study was sufficiently well powered to detect relatively small effects...|$|E
40|$|Although modest, {{sustained}} {{weight loss}} can decrease {{the risks of}} morbidity and mortality associated with obesity, medical approaches to the treatment of obesity can be very expensive and time-consuming. Adjunctive use of appetite suppressants in selected patients and use of gastroplasty in morbidly obese individuals not responding to other treatments can be effective in obesity management. <b>Self-help,</b> work-site <b>programmes,</b> proprietary and lifestyle programmes may be of benefit. For patients who have failed to control their weight despite their best efforts, it may be more cost effective to address other risk factors, particularly aerobic fitness, smoking cessation, lipid and glucose control, rather than focus only on obesity management.

40|$|Zimbabwe has a sombre {{housing crisis}} {{in all its}} urban centres. All {{attempts}} {{by the government to}} vary housing delivery systems to ameliorate the problem have proved futile as the backlog it inherited from the colonial masters continues to soar. The situation has however been exacerbated by 2005 demolitions and evictions in the country’s major cities that destroyed homes and businesses leaving the majority of the poor and disadvantaged segments of society in deeper poverty, deprivation and destitution. The main challenge to housing the urban poor is housing finance. Public funds are meagre and private funds are not accessible to the poor due to lack of collateral security and inability to service the loans. Fascinatingly, the poor’s income comes from informal sector activities that absorbs {{a large percentage of the}} labour force and keeps the economy going while the large modern enterprises continue to reel under the economic downturn. Unfortunately the Zimbabwean informal sector has generally been perceived as a nuisance, a haven for criminals and a menace. Evidence shows that there is a strong relationship between the urban poor’s housing finance, informal sector activities and self-help housing strategies in Zimbabwe. In the pre- 2005 Operation Murambatsvina era, the poor were making some construction progress as evidenced by the structures that had developed. This paper calls for active support and facilitation of the poor’s sources of income, and advocates for the involvement of other players such as the private sector and the international community in housing the poor. The Zimbabwe government’s plan to house the homeless and poor on its 250 000 stands countrywide through <b>self-help</b> <b>programmes</b> can only be successful if their sources of income are promoted and facilitated. urban poor, housing finance, informal sector, self-help, projects...|$|R
40|$|Reproduced with {{permission}} of the publisher, Cambridge University Press Copyright Â© 2006 ArnoldCommon mental health problems are highly prevalent in primary care, the UK National Service Framework for mental health demanding that effective and accessible services be made available. Although built upon a strong evidence base, traditional psychological therapies are often limited {{in terms of their}} applicability and availability. As a consequence innovative <b>self-help</b> <b>programmes</b> are increasingly being advocated as an alternative means of managing mental health illness within primary care. This study reports the results of a three month evaluation of a self-help service provided by a busy UK urban Primary Care Trust. Levels of utilization, effectiveness and stakeholder acceptability were examined through a combination of quantitative and qualitative data. A total of 662 patients were referred to the self-help clinics over a three month period, 67 % of whom attended their first appointment. The mean number of sessions per patient was 2. 8 (SD = 2. 4), with an average total time of 69. 6 min (SD = 48. 2). Mean Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation (CORE-OM) scores improved significantly between baseline and three month follow-up (P < 0. 001), 39 % of patients demonstrating a clinically significant improvement. Both selfhelp therapists and referring general practitioners reported moderate to high satisfaction with the self-help treatment model, with the majority of patients perceiving the intervention to be appropriate to their needs. Data demonstrated that, whilst there was a clear need for a simple self-help service to be based in primary care, the ultimate success of this provision necessitates a well developed infrastructure capable of providing sufficient support and information to ensure that it is flexible and responsive to individual needs...|$|R
