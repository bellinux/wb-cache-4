40|$|AbstractHeavy metal {{contamination}} of large areas due to mining and metallurgical operations poses a serious long-term environmental problem for some industrial regions of Bulgaria. The investigated Kremikovtsi region {{located near the}} capital city of Sofia, Bulgaria, {{is one of the most}} highly polluted ones by heavy metals, regarding both the soil and the <b>spoil</b> <b>banks</b> formed by long-term deposition of steel production residues and foundry. This research aimed at studying the possibility for reusing paper industry wastes as additives in phytoremediation of heavy metals polluted substrates of the <b>spoil</b> <b>banks</b> in the Kremikovtsi region. Greenhouse remediation experiments of heavy metals polluted substrates, collected from the <b>spoil</b> <b>banks</b> located in the vicinity of the metallurgical plant “Kremikovtsi”, have been performed. Phytoremediation was performed by planting 2 - years-old seedling of the red oak (Quercus rubra L.) and Austrian pine (Pinus nigra Arn.) trees. In independent experiments with a polluted substrate and with a mixture of substrate and paper wastes and inorganic fertilizers - nitrogen (N), phosphate (P 2 O 5), and potash (K 2 O), respectively were added in N-P-K ratio of 6 - 1 - 3 or 2 - 1 - 2. Plant biometric measurements, heavy metal content analyses, both in plants and substrates were performed at the end of the vegetative season. It was found that phytoremediation was enhanced by adding wastes from paper industry and mineral fertilizers. The results obtained showed that the simultaneous application of wastes from paper industry and fertilizers (N-P-K ratio equal to 2 - 1 - 2) improved both the sapling growth and the heavy metal accumulation.

40|$|Establishment of a {{petroleum}} refinery in 1916 near {{the headwaters of}} Bayou Trepagnier with subsequent dredging of the bayou resulted in spoil banks containing high levels of Pb. A large swamp abuts the eastern bank of the bayou. Cores were taken from 15 baldcypress [Taxodium distichum (L.) Richard] trees growing in the swamp along a 610 -m transect (nine trees) and a 183 -m transect (six trees) running perpendicular from the <b>spoil</b> <b>bank.</b> The cores were crossdated, annual rings were measured, and 5 -yr segments of the cores were prepared and analyzed for heavy metals. Soil samples were collected along one transect and analyzed for metals. Levels of Pb in Bayou Trepagnier swamp trees were compared to levels in nine baldcypress trees growing along Stinking Bayou, a reference area. During the last 100 yr, Pb in growth rings of swamp baldcypress trees averaged 8. 6 mg/kg (SD 4. 88) along one transect and 7. 9 mg/kg (SD 5. 39) along the other. Lead in the soil along the first transect dropped from. 2700 mg/kg (<b>spoil</b> <b>bank)</b> to 10 mg/kg at 420 m into the swamp.
