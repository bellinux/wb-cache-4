It was originally written as a <b>stand-alone</b> <b>terminal</b> emulator for the VAXStation 100 (VS100) by Mark Vandevoorde, a student of Jim Gettys, {{in the summer of}} 1984, when work on X started. It rapidly became clear that it would be more useful as part of X than as a standalone program, so it was retargeted to X. As Gettys tells the story, [...] "part of why xterm's internals are so horrifying is that it was originally intended that a single process be able to drive multiple VS100 displays." ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMisspecification of the {{designing}} parameters in {{the planning}} of a controlled clinical trial may yield an underpowered or an overpowered study. Internal pilot study, a kind of adaptive design, has gained increased attention for its allowing for sample size adjustment, especially blinded sample size adjustment that do not affect the type I error rate. Several methods were proposed to implement internal pilot design {{in recent years and}} some software emerges to simulate or implement it. But most of the software is only running on a <b>stand-alone</b> <b>terminal</b> or Client/Server(C/S) mode. We develop a system to simulate it based on Browser/Server(B/S) mode and realized on web. It allows the web users to input corresponding parameters from the web browser such as Internet Explorer to make simulations. The system was constructed with generic database schema design method and coded with Microsoft Visual Basic and Active Server Pages (ASP) programming languages. Web users on internet can use the system to make blinded variance estimate, sample size adjustment and randomization test for internal pilot study. The application of the simulation is demonstrated through an example. Not only blinded sample size adjustment is implemented but also a randomization test is performed. With applications of blinding one-sample variance for sample size recalculation and randomization test, the type I error rate is also controlled successfully...|$|E

5000|$|A {{number of}} U.S. {{companies}} also expressed an interest, and started plans {{for their own}} Telidon-based teletext systems. As early as 1978, AT&T Corporation and CBS had been experimenting {{with the idea of}} a videotex service, and were drawn towards the Telidon efforts. In 1982 they introduced an experimental system known as [...] "Venture One" [...] in Ridgewood, New Jersey, equipping some homes with <b>stand-alone</b> <b>terminals</b> from AT&T, and others with set-top boxes. The test ran for seven months from 1982 to 83, and was considered a success, so much so that AT&T publicly announced plans to introduce a commercial system in 1984.|$|R

50|$|PAR Technology Inc. {{was founded}} in 1968 in New Hartford, New York, as a high tech, {{government}} contracting firm. PAR Technology Inc. was founded by John W. Sammon. Ten years later, PAR utilized government funded research and development initiatives and applied them to the commercial sector as viable products with real business applications. PAR then used this transferred technology to develop a <b>stand-alone</b> POS <b>terminal</b> for McDonald’s Corporation, which was installed in four test McDonald's restaurants in 1978. After a successful test run, McDonald's named PAR Technology Inc. their official vendor on October 15, 1980. As of 2017, McDonald's remains one of PAR's customers.|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{decision}} support systems {{are based on}} the paradigm of a single decision maker working at a <b>stand‐alone</b> computer or <b>terminal</b> who has a specific decision to make with a specific goal in mind. Organizational {{decision support}} systems aim to support decision makers at all levels of an organization (from executive, middle management managers to operators), who have a variety of decisions to make, with different priorities, often in a distributed and dynamic environment. Such systems need to be designed and developed with extra functionality to meet the challenges such as collaborative working. This paper proposes an Integrated Decision Support Environment (IDSE) for organizational decision making. The IDSE distinguishes itself from traditional decision support systems in that it can flexibly configure and re‐configure its functions to support various decision applications. IDSE is an open software platform which allows its users to define their own decision processes and choose their own exiting decision tools to be integrated into the platform. The IDSE is designed and developed based on distributed client/server networking, with a multi‐tier integration framework for consistent information exchange and sharing, seamless process co‐ordination and synchronisation, and quick access to packaged and legacy systems. The prototype of the IDSE demonstrates good performance in agile response to fast changing decision situations...|$|R
50|$|Ever {{since its}} {{inception}} on 26 May 1989, Jawaharlal Nehru Port (JNP) has blazed a new path for itself in the port sector - aiming to set the benchmark for the heights India could reach in technological innovation and administrative skill. Envisioned in a remote location about 10 km across the Bombay Harbour, JN Port rose up from paddy fields, salt-pans and marshlands, in a Herculean effort at construction - the first large-scale industrial development in independent India. The Port {{is as much a}} representation of what is best about India's capabilities, from project conceptualization to completion, as it is an example of human endeavor against all odds. It has charted India’s international trade to a glorious course of success and achievements, breaking records and creating new benchmarks. JN Port is the biggest container handling port in India, handling around 44% of the country’s containerized cargo, crossing the historic landmark of 4 million TEUs in container throughput consecutively for the last five years. In its coveted role as the Hub Port on the West Coast of India, JNP is ranked 31st among the top 100 Container Ports in the world. Having set for itself a long-term goal of achieving 10 million TEUs by the year 2020-21, through addition of two more Terminals, viz. the 330M <b>Stand-alone</b> Container <b>Terminals</b> (DP World) and the 4th Container Terminal (Port of Singapore Authority) and a Satellite Port at Vadhvan Point, JNP throws open an array of worthwhile opportunities for the maritime trade, including the shipping lines and shippers, to ferry their cargo to various sectors across the globe. Supported by a top of the order, world-class infrastructure with high technological standards, facilities at JNP consist of a full-fledged Custom House, 30 Container Freight Stations and connectivity to 52 Inland Container Depots across the country. The excellent hinterland connectivity both by rail and road is being further strengthened by ongoing projects like the Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC), which will increase the existing train capacity of 27 to 100 trains per day; Multi-Modal Logistics Park (MMLP) and widening of the Port road connectivity. lts proximity to the Cities of Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Pune; airports; hotels, exhibition centres, etc. gives the Port an extra edge to address the shippers’ needs, efficiently and promptly. With a strong commitment to provide seamless service to the customers as India’s prime facilitator of international trade and logistics, Jawaharlal Nehru Port strives to be the undisputed leader in the South Asia Region in the years to come.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} PhD {{project was}} to {{identify}} the antimicrobial metabolites produced by Serratia plymuthica RVH 1 and to study their structure, mode of action, biosynthetic gene cluster and biosynthetic pathway, as well as rates and mechanisms of resistance. Bioactivity-guided purification and structure elucidation efforts led to {{the identification of the}} zeamines, an unusual class of cationic polyamine-polyketide-nonribosomal peptide natural products with potent activity against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The zeamine antibiotic complex from S. plymuthica RVH 1 was initially believed to consist of three compounds: zeamine and zeamine II (previously identified as metabolites of the phytopathogen Dickeya zeae), as well as zeamine I (a novel analogue). Zeamine II was found to be less effective (8 -fold higher MIC) at inhibiting the growth of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 27661 (MIC = 32 µg/ml) and Escherichia coli MG 1655 (MIC = 64 µg/ml) than zeamine and zeamine I. With an MBC/MIC ratio of 2, the zeamines can be considered bactericidal antibiotics. The zeamine metabolites further demonstrated potent cytostatic activity against human and murine cancer cells with IC 50 values ranging from 1. 7 to 4. 1 μM. Examination of their specific mode of action and cellular target revealed that zeamine, zeamine I and zeamine II disrupt the integrity of cell membranes. The antibiotics induce rapid and concentration-dependent leakage of carboxyfluorescein from small unilamellar vesicles of different phospholipid composition, demonstrating their ability to directly interact with lipid bilayers {{in the absence of a}} specific receptor. In this process, the zeamines were found to have a higher selectivity for bacterial over eukaryotic model membranes. DNA, RNA, fatty acid and protein biosynthesis cease rapidly and simultaneously in E. coli and S. aureus upon treatment with sub-inhibitory concentrations of the antibiotics, presumably as a direct consequence of membrane perturbation. The zeamines are also able to permeabilize the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, facilitating the uptake of small molecules, such as 1 -N-phenylnaphtylamine, in a dose-dependent manner. The valine-linked polyketide moiety in zeamine and zeamine I was found to increase the efficiency of this process. In contrast, bulky hydrophilic fluorescent proteins were not able to cross the outer membrane upon zeamine exposure, suggesting that the zeamines induce subtle perturbations of the outer membrane rather than drastic alterations or large pore formation. At concentrations well above the MIC, the zeamines were shown to cause membrane lysis, as indicated by time-lapse microscopy. Together, these results indicate that the bactericidal activity of zeamine, zeamine I and zeamine II derives from generalized membrane permeabilization, which is likely initiated by hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions with negatively charged membrane components. To evaluate the potential for resistance development to the zeamines, five independent lineages of S. aureus strain Newman were serially exposed to sub-inhibitory concentrations of the antibiotics. No mutants with decreased susceptibility to the zeamines could be obtained. Thus, rapid acquisition of zeamine resistance via genomic mutations seems unlikely. In a search for existing resistance determinants, the genome of Serratia proteamaculans strain LMG 7884 was examined. This strain has a higher intrinsic resistance to the zeamines. One particular locus was found to encode a putative GCN 5 -related N-acetyltransferase that induces an eight-fold increase in the MIC of the zeamines against S. proteamaculans DSM 4543. By using a combination of random transposon mutagenesis, genomic BAC-library screening and targeted gene deletions, zeamine biosynthesis was mapped to a 50 kb gene cluster (zmn 5, zmn 9 - 22) in S. plymuthica RVH 1 which appears to be conserved across different enterobacterial species and has likely been acquired via horizontal gene transfer. In addition to tailoring and export-related enzymes, two separate assembly lines are encoded by genes within the zeamine gene cluster: an iterative type I fatty acid synthase (FAS) /polyketide synthase (PKS) homologous to polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) synthases, and a hybrid nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) /PKS system. By using a combination of targeted gene deletions, high resolution LC-MS(/MS) analyses, in vitro biochemical assays and feeding studies, the pathway for zeamine biosynthesis was characterized. The pentaamino-hydroxyalkyl chain is synthesized by the multidomain FAS/PKS assembly line encoded by zmn 10 - 13. The <b>terminal,</b> <b>stand-alone</b> thioester reductase Zmn 14 is proposed to reductively release a tetraamino-hydroxyalkyl thioester as an aldehyde, using NADH as a co-substrate. Despite the intrinsic ability of this enzyme to fully reduce aldehyde substrates to alcohols, the aldehyde intermediate is believed to be preferentially transaminated, yielding zeamine II. In a parallel pathway, hexapeptide-monoketide and hexapeptide-diketide thioesters are produced by the hybrid NRPS/PKS formed by Zmn 16 - 18 and subsequently conjugated to zeamine II by the freestanding condensation domain Zmn 19. The resulting prezeamines, additional members of the zeamine antibiotic complex containing an N-terminal pentapeptide, were structurally elucidated and implicated as precursors to zeamine and zeamine I. The prezeamines are partially converted into zeamine and zeamine I by the action of an acylpeptide hydrolase that specifically cleaves off the N-terminal pentapeptide in a post-assembly proteolytic processing step. Thus, the zeamine antibiotics are assembled by a unique combination of NRPS, type I modular PKS and PUFA synthase-like multienzyme complexes. This unusual biosynthetic machinery may represent a valuable contribution to the synthetic biology toolbox for combinatorial biosynthesis and rational design of novel bioactive compounds. Furthermore, it offers valuable insights into atypical chain release mechanisms from type I PKS and PUFA synthase-like multienzymes and increases our current knowledge and understanding of secondary lipid biosynthetic processes. nrpages: 175 status: publishe...|$|R
