It may seem useless to develop a text-to-speech system when there is no text available. But we will discuss some well defined use cases where we need these models.

40|$|Conventional <b>synthetic</b> <b>voices</b> can {{synthesise}} neutral {{read aloud}} speech well. But, to make synthetic speech {{more suitable for}} {{a wider range of}} applications, the voices need to express more than just the word identity. We need to develop voices that can partake in a conversation and express, e. g. agreement, disagreement, hesitation, in a natural and believable manner. In speech synthesis there are currently two dominating frameworks: unit selection and HMM-based speech synthesis. Both frameworks utilise recordings of human speech to build <b>synthetic</b> <b>voices.</b> Despite the fact that the content of the recordings determines the segmental and prosodic phenomena that can be synthesised, surprisingly little research has been made on utilising the corpus to extend the limited behaviour of conventional <b>synthetic</b> <b>voices.</b> In this thesis we will show how natural sounding conversational characteristics can be added to both unit selection and HMM-based <b>synthetic</b> <b>voices,</b> by adding speech from a spontaneous conversation to the voices. We recorded a spontaneous conversation, and by manually transcribing and selecting utterances we obtained approximately two thousand utterances from it. These conversational utterances were rich in conversational speech phenomena, but they lacked the general coverage that allows unit selection and HMM-based synthesis techniques to synthesise high quality speech. Therefore we investigated a number of blending approaches in the <b>synthetic</b> <b>voices,</b> where the conversational utterances were augmented with conventional read aloud speech. The <b>synthetic</b> <b>voices</b> that contained conversational speech were contrasted with conventional voices without conversational speech. The perceptual evaluations showed that the conversational voices were generally perceived by listeners as having a more conversational style than the conventional voices. This conversational style was largely due to the conversational voicesâ€™ ability to synthesise utterances that contained conversational speech phenomena in a more natural manner than the conventional voices. Additionally, we conducted an experiment that showed that natural sounding conversational characteristics in synthetic speech can convey pragmatic information, in our case an impression of certainty or uncertainty, about a topic to a listener. The conclusion drawn is that the limited behaviour of conventional <b>synthetic</b> <b>voices</b> can be enriched by utilising conversational speech in both unit selection and HMM-based speech synthesis...|$|R

5000|$|Building on the {{recommendations}} of the University of Padua, by applying the technique of so-called diphones (the union of a consonant and a vowel, 150 in total for the Italian) the group created the first speech synthesizer with high intelligibility in 1975 [...] it was called MUSA (MUltichannel Speaking Automaton), which demonstrated what was possible with the technology of the time. The results achieved in those years were condensed into an audio disc at 45 rpm, with thousands of copies produced and spread through the mass communication media. It was mainly the Italian version of the song FrÃ¨re Jacques carried out in polyphony with more singing voices (MUSA could manage up to 8 synthesis channels in parallel). The evolution of this prototype, with {{the increase in the number}} of diphones (about 1000), the refinement of the tools of linguistic analysis and better waveform management led to a marked improvement of the <b>synthetic</b> <b>voice.</b> This led to the creation of the integrated circuit [...] "voice synthesizer" [...] developed internally in CSELT which was added to the SGS (catalog as Zilog's Z80 microprocessor's peripheral (with the code M8950).|$|E
5000|$|Although both {{pilots were}} based in ZÃ¼rich and the CVR picks up Lutz's query to Loehrer about Loehrer's {{familiarity}} with [...] "the 28 approach", which Loehrer confirmed he had, Lutz put the plane into an overly-steep descent that brought flight 3597 to MDA far too soon. When Loehrer reported the plane reaching 100 feet above MDA, the CVR records Lutz asking Loehrer, [...] "Do we have ground contact?" [...] Loehrer hesitated before replying [...] "Yes". However, flight simulators programmed {{with the time}} of day, terrain, and weather Lutz was facing at that time allowed investigators to determine that the only ground Lutz or Loehrer {{could see was the}} ground of the hilly terrain over which the plane was flying. Upon reaching MDA of 2400 ft, Lutz declared that he had [...] "ground contact" [...] and would continue on, then deliberately descended the plane below the minimum descent altitude (MDA) without having the required visual contact with either the approach lights or the runway, a major piloting error that ultimately led directly to the crash. The fact that Loehrer made no attempt to prevent the continuation of the flight below the minimum descent altitude also directly contributed to the crash. Lutz made an additional error by not monitoring his Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) as he made his approach; the CVR recorded Lutz's running narrative on nearly every move he made in the cockpit, but did not record any readout of the DME after a check, verified by Loehrer, at [...] from runway 28. Moments before the crash, Lutz's running commentary indicated to investigators that Lutz must have thought he was at or near [...] from runway 28 because he said [...] "Someone said he saw the runway late here". Instead, Lutz was over [...] from the runway, and could not possibly have seen the runway due to the presence of a hill, below the MDA of 2400 ft, that would have obscured his view. It was into this hill that Flight 3597 eventually crashed. Just before the crash, the <b>synthetic</b> <b>voice</b> of the ground proximity warning system (GPWS) announced the radio altimeter reading 500 feet above ground. Immediately thereafter Lutz exclaimed [...] "*****, two miles he said, he sees the runway". A few seconds later Lutz said [...] "Two thousand" [...] and then one second later the <b>synthetic</b> <b>voice</b> gave the [...] "minimums" [...] GPWS message, which was triggered by the radio altimeter reading at 300 feet. Even though Lutz finally realized that his inability to see the runway meant he needed to initiate a missed approach maneuver (called a [...] "Go-around"), his call for the go-around came too late; the plane's engines were not able to spool up fast enough to generate sufficient thrust to climb above the hill that had been obstructing his view, and it crashed into the hilltop at 22:06 CET.|$|E
