5|$|The see of Canterbury <b>seems</b> <b>at</b> {{this time}} to have been passing {{through a period of}} {{comparative}} obscurity. During Deusdedit's nine years as archbishop, all the new bishops in England were consecrated by Celtic or foreign bishops, with one exception: Deusdedit consecrated Damianus, Ithamar's successor as Bishop of Rochester. Deusdedit did, however, found a nunnery in the Isle of Thanet and helped with the foundation of Medeshamstede Abbey, later Peterborough Abbey, in 657. He was long overshadowed by Agilbert, bishop to the West Saxons, and his authority as archbishop probably did not extend past his own diocese and that of Rochester, which had traditionally been dependent on Canterbury.|$|E
25|$|Swedish {{historians have}} been excusably indulgent {{to the father}} of their {{greatest}} ruler. Indisputably Charles was cruel, ungenerous and vindictive; yet he <b>seems,</b> <b>at</b> all hazards, strenuously to have endeavoured to do his duty {{during a period of}} political and religious transition, and, despite his violence and brutality, possessed many of the qualities of a wise and courageous statesman.|$|E
25|$|Cartan's {{approach}} <b>seems</b> <b>at</b> {{first to}} be coordinate dependent because of the choice of frames it involves. However, it is not, and the notion can be described precisely using the language of principal bundles. Cartan connections induce covariant derivatives and other differential operators on certain associated bundles, hence a notion of parallel transport. They have many applications in geometry and physics: see the method of moving frames, Cartan connection applications and Einstein–Cartan theory for some examples.|$|E
6000|$|The general <b>seemed</b> <b>at</b> {{a loss to}} {{understand}} why his having come home in the Screw should occasion such a sensation, nor did he <b>seem</b> <b>at</b> all clearer on the subject when Mr Norris, introducing him to Martin, said: ...|$|R

The old man <b>seemed</b> <b>at</b> home in the ruins, {{and led the way}} readily. 'Did he know the Widow Laurent's house?' ...|$|R
25|$|As {{electrolyte}} materials, {{the inclusion}} of MOFs <b>seems</b> <b>at</b> first counter-intuitive. Fuel cell membranes generally have low porosity to prevent fuel crossover and loss of voltage between the anode and cathode. Additionally, membranes tend to have low crystallinity because the transport of ions is more favorable in disordered materials. On the other hand, pores can be filled with additional ion carriers that ultimately enhance the ionic conductivity {{of the system and}} high crystallinity makes the design process less complex.|$|E
25|$|Attributing {{the various}} {{architectural}} stages can be difficult, {{and the degree}} to which Inigo Jones was involved has been questioned. Queen Henrietta Maria, a frequent guest at Wilton, interrogated Jones about his work there. At the time (1635) he was employed by her, completing the Queen's House at Greenwich. It <b>seems</b> <b>at</b> this time Jones was too busy with his royal clients and did no more than provide a few sketches for a mansion, which he then delegated for execution to an assistant Isaac de Caus (sometimes spelt 'Caux'), a Frenchman and landscape gardener from Dieppe.|$|E
25|$|Colonel Abel Pargiter visits his {{mistress}} Mira in a dingy suburb, then returns {{home to his}} children and his invalid wife Rose. His eldest daughter Eleanor is a do-gooder in her early twenties, and Milly and Delia are in their teens. Morris, the eldest brother, is already a practising barrister. Delia feels trapped by her mother's illness and looks forward to her death. Ten-year-old Rose quarrels with twelve-year-old Martin and sneaks off by herself to a nearby toyshop. On the way back she is frightened by a man exposing himself. As the family prepares for bed, Mrs Pargiter <b>seems</b> <b>at</b> last to have died, but she recovers.|$|E

25|$|The {{principal}} {{office of the}} writ of coram nobis was to enable the same court which had rendered the judgment to reconsider it in {{a case in which}} the record still remained before that court. The most comprehensive statement of the office and function of this writ which has come to our notice is the following: The office of the writ of coram nobis is to bring the attention of the court to, and obtain relief from, errors of fact, such as the death of either party pending the suit and before judgment therein; or infancy, where the party was not properly represented by guardian, or coverture, where the common-law disability still exists, or insanity, it <b>seems,</b> <b>at</b> the time of the trial; or a valid defense existing in the facts of the case, but which, without negligence {{on the part of the}} defendant, was not made, either through duress or fraud or excusable mistake; these facts not appearing on the face of the record, and being such as, if known in season, would have prevented the rendition and entry of the judgment questioned.|$|E
25|$|Ipomadon {{travels the}} world, {{fighting}} in tournaments, becomes King of Apulia following his father's death, and hears {{one day that}} the Proud is being besieged in her city by a knight called Lyoline. This ugly knight is threatening to take her away with him to India. Ipomadon {{makes his way to}} King Maleager's court once again, just in time to witness the arrival of the Proud's messenger, begging for some assistance for her lady. But curiously, Ipomadon has chosen to arrive at King Maleager's court {{in such a way that}} he is not recognised, not even by the queen. He pretends to be a fool, and the reader (or listener) is treated to a comic scene in which the fool Ipomadon is first ridiculed and then accepted by the knights and noblemen, little knowing who he really is. Cabanus is conveniently absent from court on this occasion. The maiden who has been sent as a messenger by the Proud is mightily unimpressed that a fool should wish to take on the challenge, but since nobody else in the court <b>seems</b> <b>at</b> all inclined to offer their services, the king allows Ipomadon the fool to take it up.|$|E

500|$|According to Raul Hilberg, Finkelstein {{displays}} [...] "academic {{courage to}} speak the truth when no one else is out there to support him... I would say that his place in the whole history of writing history is assured, and that those who in the end are proven right triumph, and he will be among those who will have triumphed, albeit, it so <b>seems,</b> <b>at</b> great cost." [...] In a peer review for Beyond Chutzpah, Avi Shlaim said that Finkelstein [...] "has a most impressive track record in exposing spurious American-Jewish scholarship on the Arab-Israeli conflict." [...] He praised Finkelstein for [...] "all the sterling qualities for which he has become famous: erudition, originality, spark, meticulous attention to detail, intellectual integrity, courage, and formidable forensic skills." ...|$|E
500|$|Conway {{described}} the panel as indicating [...] "an astonishing depth of psychological insight" [...] {{for an artist}} not yet 20 years old. In its simple design and detail it shares many of the characteristics of, and is a key precursor to, Dürer's mature work. He [...] portrayed his father again in 1497, when the older man would have been around 70. He has aged noticeably in the intervening seven years: his skin is saggier, the wrinkles deeper and more pronounced. In this later portrait Dürer <b>seems</b> <b>at</b> pains to convey these effects of ageing, which are all too evident on his father's face. According to Brion, his eyes have lost their [...] "distant, mystic" [...] appearance and now seem less contented. Conway agrees, seeing traces of haggardly agitation, but holds that the two paintings convey a similar overall highly favourable and compassionate impression of the man.|$|E
500|$|His praenomen is unknown, {{but he was}} {{probably}} named Nero Claudius Drusus after his father (conventionally called [...] "Drusus"), or possibly Tiberius Claudius Nero after his uncle Tiberius. In 9 BC, the agnomen Germanicus was added to his full name when it was posthumously awarded to his father {{in honor of his}} victories in Germania. Though the name was inherited by his siblings too, the title <b>seems</b> <b>at</b> first to have been used exclusively by him. By AD 4 he was adopted as Tiberius' son and heir. As a result, Germanicus was adopted out of the Claudii and into the Julii. In accordance with Roman naming conventions, he adopted the name [...] "Julius Caesar" [...] while retaining his agnomen, becoming Germanicus Julius Caesar. Upon Germanicus' adoption into the Julii, his brother Claudius became the sole legal representative of his father, and chose to assume the title Germanicus as well.|$|E

500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{called the}} song {{a list of}} celeb perks: trainer, butler, assistant, three nannies, a {{bodyguard}} or five. It <b>seems,</b> <b>at</b> first, not like the clever self-twitting she clearly intended, but rather a facile confirmation of her haters' conviction: that the middle-aged Madonna {{does not have a}} worldview beyond her next Pilates appointment. In 2004, Blender magazine listed the song at number nine on the list of the 50 Worst Songs Ever, stating that Madonna [...] "updates the 'Material Girl'-era satire of commercialism and spiritual emptiness... with what is hands-down the most embarrassing rap ever recorded. Nervous and choppy, she makes Debbie Harry sound as smooth as Jay-Z." [...] The magazine also said that the worst moment of the song is when after rapping, Madonna sings 'Nothing is what it seems' with no profundity. Stephen Thompson of The A.V. Club considered the song to be [...] "jittery, tuneless, and shallow to the point of self-parody".|$|E
500|$|Before the race, {{there were}} no clear favourites for the gold medal. In a preview written on the ITU website, Merryn Sherwood {{identified}} Jenkins, Moffatt, Densham, Spirig and Andrea Hewitt (New Zealand) as favourites. She wrote that she expected Lucy Hall (Great Britain), Hewitt and Densham to be strong on the swim leg {{along with a few}} other athletes. Sherwood thought that if that there was a large group of athletes together on the run then many of the competitors would fancy their chances at winning. Sherwood wrote, [...] "Most importantly every athlete will be going into the race knowing they have a chance." [...] Sherwood's thoughts were similar to those of New Zealander Kate McIlroy who said, [...] "It’s funny, the women’s race <b>seems</b> <b>at</b> the moment there is probably 25 girls that could win it on the day." [...] On the website Triathlete Courtney Baird said that the race favourites were Paula Findlay (Canada), Jenkins, Hewitt and Densham.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, the riverfront park {{landscaping}} {{surrounding the}} building, which {{is referred to}} as Trump Plaza and Riverwalk or sometimes just Trump Plaza, became the subject of controversy. In 2010, the Plaza had earned special recognition at the Mayor Daley's Landscape Awards. The press release noted the landscaping [...] "for their magnificent new civic landscape that is a poetic interpretation of native Illinois that <b>seems</b> <b>at</b> once sophisticated and familiar." [...] However, in 2011, the award-winning plantings of small sumac trees, ferns and native grasses with yellow, orange and red hues were removed and replaced with evergreens like junipers and boxwoods, pieces of gray stone, and purple perennials (catmint and salvia), which may require less watering. To add to the controversy, the planting was accompanied by a plan to light the trees to attract nighttime park visitors, in conflict with the [...] "dark skies" [...] movement to reduce light pollution to facilitate better stargazing.|$|E

500|$|Wallace {{described}} himself as being at first reluctant to try {{it because of the}} aroma, [...] "but in Borneo I found a ripe fruit on the ground, and, eating it out of doors, I at once became a confirmed Durian eater." [...] He cited one traveller from 1599: [...] "it is of such an excellent taste that it surpasses in flavour all other fruits of the world, according to those who have tasted it." [...] He cites another writer: [...] "To those not used to it, it <b>seems</b> <b>at</b> first to smell like rotten onions, but immediately after they have tasted it they prefer it to all other food. The natives give it honourable titles, exalt it, and make verses on it." [...] Despite having tried many foods that are arguably more eccentric, Andrew Zimmern, host of Bizarre Foods, was unable to finish a durian upon sampling it, due to his intolerance of its strong taste.|$|E
500|$|Spence D. of IGN Music {{added that}} Beyoncé's [...] "crisp voice" [...] <b>seems</b> <b>at</b> {{odds with the}} beats {{featured}} in the song. However, he continued saying that it [...] "when it gets muted and overlapped on the chorus, it sounds purely hypnotical." [...] Jaime Gill of Yahoo! Music described the track as a [...] "driving" [...] and [...] "strutting" [...] one. Jon Pareles of The New York Times stated: [...] " [...] rhythm-driven songs, especially 'Get Me Bodied', could be high-tech upgrades of an old African-American form, the ring shout [...] ". Darryl Sterdan, writing for the Canadian website Jam!, said that the song manages dancing into a contact sport {{with the help of}} cheerleader hand-claps. Dave de Sylvia of Sputnikmusic considered [...] "Get Me Bodied" [...] as one of the three production triumphs on B'Day. Richard Cromelin of Los Angeles Times wrote that [...] "Get Me Bodied" [...] sounds [...] "like fun" [...] for Beyoncé, connecting her with deep, vital cultural roots. He also went on saying that [...] "the playful chant" [...] suggests both children's street game and traditional work song, and the whiff of Louisiana in the beat taps her own Creole heritage.|$|E
500|$|... "Stay (Faraway, So Close!)" [...] was {{critically}} acclaimed. Music journalist Sam Richards {{rated the}} song four stars out of five, calling it [...] "a twinkling '90s alt. rock ballad- {{a cousin of}} Radiohead's [...] "High and Dry" [...] and Smashing Pumpkins' [...] "1979"- that just about manages to {{keep a lid on}} its impulse to seek out the nearest clifftop." [...] Hot Press editor Niall Stokes said [...] "the performance is full of languorous beauty, a gentle understated kind of emotion that <b>seems</b> <b>at</b> odds with the disorientation in the lyrics." [...] Billboard contributor Fred Bronson joked that it was an example of how songs named [...] "Stay" [...] reach the Hot 100, following similarly named hits by Big Mountain, The Four Seasons, Shakespears Sister, and Jodeci. Robert Levine of Spin called it one of their best songs, saying [...] "They're still obsessed with transcendence, whether it's the kind you find on a Joshua Tree bluff or a [...] "Miami" [...] dance floor. And [...] framed that search in the most intimate of terms, even when they were too jaded to crawl out from under their lemon and look us in the eye." ...|$|E
