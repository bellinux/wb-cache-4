5|$|A {{larger and}} more {{extended}} version of Paul Brown's coaching tree, which could <b>sometimes</b> <b>be</b> called a forest, can be found here. However, this version completely omits any mention of Bill Walsh, or his tree.|$|E
5|$|Although {{crystallography}} {{can be used}} {{to characterize}} the disorder in an impure or irregular crystal, crystallography generally requires a pure crystal of high regularity to solve the structure of a complicated arrangement of atoms. Pure, regular crystals can <b>sometimes</b> <b>be</b> obtained from natural or synthetic materials, such as samples of metals, minerals or other macroscopic materials. The regularity of such crystals can <b>sometimes</b> <b>be</b> improved with macromolecular crystal annealing and other methods. However, in many cases, obtaining a diffraction-quality crystal is the chief barrier to solving its atomic-resolution structure.|$|E
50|$|Because Rangvald Ulfsson has <b>sometimes</b> <b>been</b> {{regarded}} {{as the father of}} Stenkil, Astrid has <b>sometimes</b> <b>been</b> {{regarded as}} that king's mother.|$|R
25|$|In modern scholarship, {{the word}} has <b>sometimes</b> <b>been</b> re-interpreted from the {{traditional}} meaning of carpenter and has <b>sometimes</b> <b>been</b> translated as craftsman, as the meaning of builder is implied, but {{can be applied to}} both wood-work and stone masonry.|$|R
5000|$|Tsikhistavi’s income <b>sometimes</b> <b>was</b> {{collected}} {{in the form of}} a special tax (Satsikhistavo, საციხისთავო). Tsikhistavis subordinated to the Eristavt-eristavi, Eristavi and Mouravi of a city. [...] In the 17th and 18th centuries, Tsikhistavis <b>sometimes</b> <b>are</b> named as a Minibashi (მინიბაში).|$|R
5|$|Carey can <b>sometimes</b> <b>be</b> seen on {{the sidelines}} of U.S. National Team soccer games as a press photographer. His images are sold via wire {{services}} under the pseudonym Brooks Parkenridge. He was at the 2006 FIFA World Cup {{in the summer of}} 2006, for his television show Drew Carey's Sporting Adventures.|$|E
5|$|Early {{education}} in Hagley was by private tutors. In 1855 a school {{opened in the}} Church of England building, taking in both borders and day scholars. Schooling had to <b>sometimes</b> <b>be</b> interrupted as the building was used during school hours for marriages, and religious services.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, goalkeepers {{should have}} leadership. They should inform field players of information, such as unmarked {{players and the}} time of the game clock and give {{instructions}} to the field players. Because of this, they may <b>sometimes</b> <b>be</b> known as the coach in the water.|$|E

5|$|The darting can <b>sometimes</b> <b>be</b> so {{forceful}} {{that the}} dart ends up {{buried in the}} internal organs. It can also happen that a dart will pierce the body or head entirely, and protrude on the other side.|$|E
5|$|A third protein can <b>sometimes</b> <b>be</b> {{involved}} in type II toxin-antitoxin systems. In {{the case of}} the aforementioned MazEF addiction module, in addition to the toxin and antitoxin there is a regulatory protein involved called MazG. MazG protein interacts with E. colis Era GTPase and is described as a 'nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase,' which hydrolyses nucleoside triphosphates to monophosphates. Later research showed that MazG is transcribed in the same polycistronic mRNA as MazE and MazF, and that MazG bound the MazF toxin to further inhibit its activity.|$|E
5|$|Although it can {{be found}} in {{elevations}} up to about , it is far more commonly found in humid lowland areas, and most often observed in subtropical, marshy regions of its range. It is also frequently found in shrublands, woodlands, agricultural fields, and mangroves, often adjacent to water, such as rivers, streams, rice paddies, and ditches. It may also <b>sometimes</b> <b>be</b> found in villages and suburban areas. It is able to survive in other habitats also.|$|E

5|$|An optical phenomenon, {{known as}} a green flash, can <b>sometimes</b> <b>be</b> seen shortly after sunset or before sunrise. The flash is caused by light from the Sun just below the horizon being bent (usually through a {{temperature}} inversion) towards the observer. Light of shorter wavelengths (violet, blue, green) is bent more than that of longer wavelengths (yellow, orange, red) but the violet and blue light is scattered more, leaving light that is perceived as green.|$|E
5|$|Apart from headache, about 50% of {{patients}} experience neck pain or stiffness, nausea, and vomiting. Other symptoms include dizziness and vertigo, facial numbness or weakness, unusually blurry or double vision, neuralgia, fatigue, or a metallic taste in the mouth. Leaking CSF can <b>sometimes</b> <b>be</b> felt or observed as a {{discharge from the}} nose or ear.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage may {{extend beyond}} an {{aircraft}}'s airframe. High-flying aircraft can <b>sometimes</b> <b>be</b> detected by their vapor contrails. Researchers have considered whether these might be reduced {{with the use}} of chemical additives. Work was carried out on a contrail management system for B-2 stealth bombers in 1994. From the Second World War onwards, reconnaissance pilots took care to avoid creating contrails, varying their altitude as necessary; the Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft was equipped with a mirror to enable the pilot to see if the plane was creating a contrail, and to take action accordingly.|$|E

5|$|Disjunct {{populations of}} the giant {{freshwater}} stingray in separate river drainages are probably isolated from one another; though the species occurs in brackish environments, {{there is no evidence}} that it crosses marine waters. This is a bottom-dwelling species that favors a sandy or muddy habitat. Unexpectedly, it can <b>sometimes</b> <b>be</b> found near heavily populated urban areas.|$|E
5|$|During daytime, the {{angelshark}} usually lies motionless {{on the sea}} floor, {{buried under}} a layer of sediment with only its eyes showing. At night, it becomes more active, and may <b>sometimes</b> <b>be</b> seen swimming above the bottom. Aggregations numbering up to a hundred have been observed off Gran Canaria in the summer. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Grillotia smaris-gora, G. angeli, and Christianella minuta, the fluke Pseudocotyle squatinae, the monogenean Leptocotyle minor, and the isopod Aega rosacea.|$|E
5|$|For {{activities}} {{open to the}} public, such {{as community}} gatherings, school events, or trade shows, a police- or media-issued press pass may offer little advantage. Free or reduced-price admission, or guaranteed entry, can <b>sometimes</b> <b>be</b> arranged. The benefits may be more extensive, granting access to front-row seats or to press-only rooms. For sporting events, a press pass issued by a stadium grants access to the press box. Because open events are usually funded by paying attendees, the number of press passes may depend {{on the number of}} tickets sold.|$|E

5|$|In rare cases, beagles {{may develop}} immune {{mediated}} polygenic arthritis (where {{the immune system}} attacks the joints) even at a young age. The symptoms can <b>sometimes</b> <b>be</b> relieved by steroid treatments. Another rare disease in the breed is neonatal cerebellar cortical degeneration. Affected puppies are slow, have lower co-ordination, fall more often and don't have a normal gait. It has an estimated carrier rate of 5% and affected rate of 0.1%. A genetic test is available.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, the {{personal}} advertisements section in newspapers would <b>sometimes</b> <b>be</b> used to exchange messages encrypted using simple cipher schemes. Kahn (1967) describes instances of lovers engaging in secret communications enciphered using the Caesar cipher in The Times. Even {{as late as}} 1915, the Caesar cipher was in use: the Russian army employed it {{as a replacement for}} more complicated ciphers which had proved to be too difficult for their troops to master; German and Austrian cryptanalysts had little difficulty in decrypting their messages.|$|E
5|$|Inversions. When on a {{clear and}} calm night, a {{radiation}} inversion is formed near the ground, the friction does not affect wind above {{the top of the}} inversion layer. The change in wind can be 90degrees in direction and 40kt in speed. Even a nocturnal (overnight) low level jet can <b>sometimes</b> <b>be</b> observed. It tends to be strongest towards sunrise. Density differences cause additional problems to aviation.|$|E
