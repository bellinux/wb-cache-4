5|$|Kunjunni S. Kumar, son of cinematographer S.Kumar, {{was hired}} as Loham's cinematographer. Kunjunni had first worked with Ranjith as an {{associate}} director during the production of Indian Rupee (2011) while his father worked behind the camera. Earlier, {{he was supposed to}} debut as a cinematographer on Ranjith's Leela in 2012, but the project was shelved ten days before production. In an interview with the Deccan Chronicle, Kunjunni said that after the script narration, Ranjith told him to avoid gimmicks in framing and shots {{in order to make it}} more realistic. Mythili, who was cast by Ranjith in her debut film, acted in and served as an assistant director for the film which was her debut behind the camera. She also sang a duet song in the film's soundtrack. Sreevalsan J. Menon was selected by Ranjith to compose the film's original music score. Renji Panicker suggested Menon to Ranjith during the film's pre-production <b>stage.</b> <b>C.</b> Rajamani composed the film score.|$|E

2500|$|During the Pleistocene epoch (1.7 {{million years}} ago), the River Trent {{rose in the}} Welsh hills and flowed almost east from Nottingham through the present Vale of Belvoir to cut a gap through the {{limestone}} ridge at Ancaster and thence to the North Sea. At {{the end of the}} Wolstonian <b>Stage</b> (<b>c.</b> 130,000 years ago) a mass of stagnant ice left in the Vale of Belvoir caused the river to divert north along the old Lincoln river, through the Lincoln gap, along what is now the course of the Witham. During a following glaciation (Devensian, 70,000BC) the ice held back vast areas of water – called Glacial Lake Humber – in the current lower Trent basin. [...] When this retreated, the Trent adopted its current course into the Humber.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND CEAP {{classification}} of venous diseases included the clinical, etiological, anatomic,and pathophysiological mechanisms of chronic venous insufficiency. The {{aim of this}} studywas to evaluate the convenience of Doppler ultrasound and photoplethysmography in thediagnostic work-up of chronic venous diseases, according to the CEAP clinical classification. Patients and 2 groups of subjects were incorporated in the study. The first group included 30 patientsmethods with mild chronic venous insufficiency, clinical <b>stages</b> <b>C</b> 1, C 2 and C 3 of CEAP classification, while second group included 30 patients with severe chronic venous insufficiency(stages C 4, C 5 and C 6). Venous hemodynamics evaluation was performed with Dopplerultrasound and photoplethysmography. RESULTS A cross insufficiency was found by Doppler sonographic investigation in 10 (33 %) ofcases from the group of patients with mild venous insufficiency, whereas in the group withsevere chronic venous insufficiency in 23 (76. 7 %) of cases (p < 0. 001). In the group ofpatients with mild venous insufficiency, a pathological plethysmographic curve was observed in 11 (36. 7 %) {{out of a total}} of 30 subjects examined. At the same time, in the group ofpatients with severe chronic venous insufficiency, a shortening of plethysmografic curvewas detected in 28 (93. 3 %) of subjects (p < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS In the group of patients with severe chronic venous insufficiency, clinical <b>stages</b> <b>C</b> 4, C 5 and C 6, a significant higher number of pathological photoplethysmografic and ultrasoundDoppler values were found, which indicates that the varicose veins are associated with afunctional disturbances.

2500|$|Stratigraphic {{evidence}} suggests that chronological sequence aligned with the physical differences between the three species; and it describes an evolutionary progression within the Morrison Formation. C. grandis is the oldest species and occurred in the lowest rock layers of the Morrison. C. lentus appeared later, co-existing with grandis for several million years, possibly due to different ecological niches as suggested by differences in the spinal anatomy of the two species. At a later <b>stage,</b> <b>C.</b> grandis disappeared from the rock record, leaving only C. lentus. Then C. lentus too disappeared; {{at the same time}} C. supremus appeared in the uppermost layers. This immediate succession of species, as well as the very close similarity between the two, suggests that C. supremus may have evolved directly from C. lentus, representing [...] a larger, later-surviving population of animals.|$|E
