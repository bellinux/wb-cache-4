500|$|Before the trial, Martin made a {{statement}} explaining that he killed Lowe in self-defence. He said he had fallen asleep after checking in, but woke up after someone touched his buttocks; it was Lowe, who was clad only in his underwear and <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> To him, this behaviour made Lowe {{appear to be a}} homosexual, so he kicked Lowe away. This angered Lowe, who threw Martin's hammer at his stomach. Martin then grabbed the hammer and [...] "hit [...] several times on the head until he collapsed onto the carpeted floor." [...] A friend later helped him to dispose of Lowe's body by throwing it into the Singapore River. Martin continued, [...] "I am not sure what was the next thing I did... everything was such a blur to me after this incident that I was walking around in a dream world for the next few days." [...] He refused to identify his friend, saying, [...] "I cannot tell you his identity because if he knew he would harm my family back in Britain." [...] On 15 March, he flew to Phuket, where he met his friend again. His friend gave him the passports and other items belonging to the Damudes, whom he never met.|$|E
2500|$|In London, Wallace {{is brought}} before an English magistrate, tried for high treason, and {{condemned}} to public torture and beheading. Even whilst being hanged, drawn and quartered, Wallace refuses {{to submit to}} the king. As cries for mercy come from the watching crowd deeply moved by the Scotsman's valor, the magistrate offers him one final chance, asking him only to utter the word, [...] "Mercy", and be granted a quick death. Wallace instead shouts, [...] "Freedom!", and the judge orders his death. Moments before being decapitated, Wallace sees a vision of Murron in the crowd, <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Between {{the series}} finale, [...] "Everyone's Waiting", and the obituaries {{published}} at the official HBO website, the viewers learn of David's {{life after the}} show up until his death. [...] David teaches Durrell how to embalm a body, and Durrell is seen continuing the business into adulthood. [...] In 2009, David and Keith are legally married, {{which was the first}} depicted on a fictional American series; they remain together until Keith is murdered in 2029. At Claire's wedding, Durrell is seated with a woman and (presumably) their child, while Anthony is seated next to a man, whose hand he is holding. [...] David retires from Fisher & Sons in 2034 (Durrell continues the business), and goes on to star in many local community theater productions. [...] He later enters into a relationship with a man named Raoul Martinez, and they are together when David dies at a family function in 2044 at age 75. His final vision is of a young and healthy Keith catching a football and <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
