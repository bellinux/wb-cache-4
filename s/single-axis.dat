25|$|In {{portable}} photography equipment, <b>single-axis</b> gimbal {{heads are}} used {{in order to allow}} a balanced movement for camera and lenses. This proves useful in wildlife photography as well as in any other case where very long and heavy telephoto lenses are adopted: a gimbal head rotates a lens around its center of gravity, thus allowing for easy and smooth manipulation while tracking moving subjects.|$|E

Libertarians make up a larger portion of the US electorate than the much-discussed [...] "soccer moms" [...] and [...] "NASCAR dads", yet this is not widely recognized.

2500|$|Ailerons {{are a key}} {{device for}} the lateral flight control of {{airplanes}} to enable their safe flight. They are still in almost universal use in the present day by civilian and military aircraft, [...] and even on the most sophisticated jetliners. In 1873, five years after Boulton's aileron patent, the French military engineer and aircraft designer Charles Renard built and flew at St.-Eloi, near Arras, a small unmanned multi-wing glider incorporating ailerons (which he termed ‘winglets’) {{on each side of}} its body, controlled by Boulton's pendulum control <b>single-axis</b> autopilot device with a design layout that closely matched the patent.|$|E
2500|$|At {{least three}} <b>single-axis</b> CMGs are {{necessary}} for control of spacecraft attitude. [...] However, {{no matter how many}} CMGs a spacecraft uses, gimbal motion can lead to relative orientations that produce no usable output torque along certain directions. [...] These orientations are known as singularities and are related to the kinematics of robotic systems that encounter limits on the end-effector velocities due to certain joint alignments. [...] Avoiding these singularities is naturally of great interest, and several techniques have been proposed. [...] David Bailey and others have argued (in patents and in academic publications) that merely avoiding the [...] "divide by zero" [...] error that is associated with these singularities is sufficient. Two more recent patents summarize competing approaches. See also: Gimbal Lock.|$|E
2500|$|Downsizing the Trident {{involved}} {{substantial changes}} to the design being made, including a powerplant change from the Medway to a scaled-down derivative, the 40 percent less powerful 9,850lbf (43.8kN) Rolls-Royce Spey 505. The gross weight was cut by about a third to 105,000 pounds (48,000kilograms), while the range was cut {{by more than half}} to , and mixed-class seating was cut by about a quarter to 75 or 80 (97 in a single-class layout). Wing span was reduced by approximately , wing area by 30 percent and overall length by [...] The revised design retained some features of the original one, notably its fuselage diameter. It had a smaller flightdeck and <b>single-axis,</b> two-wheel, four-tyre main undercarriage legs in place of four-wheel bogies. Woods summarised the BEA-mandated redesign as: [...] "At one blow the 121 was emasculated in terms of size, power and range".|$|E
2500|$|The {{enclosed}} {{parabolic trough}} solar thermal system encapsulates the components within an off-the-shelf greenhouse type of glasshouse. The glasshouse protects the components {{from the elements}} that can negatively impact system reliability and efficiency. [...] This protection importantly includes nightly glass-roof washing with optimized water-efficient off-the-shelf automated washing systems. Lightweight curved solar-reflecting mirrors are suspended from {{the ceiling of the}} glasshouse by wires. A <b>single-axis</b> tracking system positions the mirrors to retrieve the optimal amount of sunlight. The mirrors concentrate the sunlight and focus it on a network of stationary steel pipes, also suspended from the glasshouse structure. Water is pumped through the pipes and boiled to generate steam when intense sun radiation is applied. The steam is available for process heat. Sheltering the mirrors from the wind allows them to achieve higher temperature rates and prevents dust from building up on the mirrors as a result from exposure to humidity.|$|E
2500|$|In 1868, {{long before}} the advent of powered {{aircraft}} flight — and within a decade of the birth of both Orville and Wilbur Wright — Boulton patented the first aileron. [...] The aileron system he created was to be actuated by either a hand operated control (not illustrated on the patent's drawings) or by an automatic pendulum control device (depicted on the patent's drawing sheet), with the intended function of a <b>single-axis</b> autopilot. Boulton's inspiration for a lateral flight control device has been attributed to French Count Ferdinand Charles Honore Phillipe d'Esterno, whose detailed analysis of flapping and soaring bird flight, Du Vol des Oiseaux (On the flight of birds) was published as a pamphlet in 1864. Although Boulton's prescient aileron control system was fully functional, he, as did almost everyone of his era, lacked a detailed understanding of aerodynamics, and an airplane he designed never achieved flight.|$|E

Massachusetts-based 1366 Technologies will develop a new cell architecture for low-cost, multi-crystalline silicon cells, which will enhance cell performance through improved light-trapping texturing and grooves for self-aligned metallization fingers. California's Innovalight will use ink-jet printing to transfer their [...] "siliconink" [...] onto thin-crystalline silicon wafers to produce high-efficiency, low-cost solar cells and modules. Skyline Solar, also in California, will develop an integrated, lightweight, <b>single-axis</b> tracked system that reflects and concentrates sunlight over 10times onto silicon cells. Solasta, in Massachusetts, is working on a novel cell design that increases currents and lowers the materials cost. Solexel, another California-based company, will commercialize a disruptive, 3Dhigh-efficiency mono-crystalline silicon cell technology that dramatically reduces manufacturing cost per watt. Finally, Spire Semiconductor in New Hampshire will develop three-junction tandem solar cells that better optimize the optical properties of their device layers; the company is targeting cell efficiencies over 42% using a low-cost manufacturing method.|$|E
2500|$|After the 1989 Loma Prieta {{earthquake}} occurred, a {{group led}} by Antony C.
