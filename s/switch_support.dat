50|$|The {{importance}} of {{get out the}} vote efforts increases as the total percentage of the population voting decreases. For instance, with only two-thirds of the population voting in a Canadian election it is often easier and more cost effective to ensure that a hundred supporters show up on polling day than it is to convince a hundred voters to <b>switch</b> <b>support</b> from one party to the other. This situation often leads to polarized electoral politics. A 90% turnout from a party's radical base is often better than a 50 percent turnout from both radical and moderate supporters.|$|E

5000|$|On 28 September 1197, Emperor Henry VI, who {{was just}} 32 years old, died {{unexpectedly}} creating unrest in the circles of the princes about the future direction of the Empire.

The princes were now faced with the question as to whether they would recognize the Henry's son, Frederick II, now only three years old, as successor. Although Frederick had already been elected at the end of 1196 in Frankfurt under the heavy influence of the Archbishop of Mainz, Konrad von Wittelsbach, and Duke of Swabia, Philip, the temptation to <b>switch</b> <b>support</b> away from the former ruling house grew.|$|E
5000|$|Feature Group D: The current standard, {{requires}} the local <b>switch</b> <b>support</b> equal access by competing carriers at the trunk level; highest quality connection, and allows pre-selection of the interexchange carrier by the end-user. This feature group permits {{two types of}} calls. If a user dials 1 + area code + seven-digit number, the long distance call is handled by a default carrier chosen by the user. Alternatively, a user dials 101 + four-digit carrier code + area code + seven-digit number, and the call is handled by the carrier specified by the carrier code. The original batch of carrier codes began with 0, so this type of [...] "dial around" [...] service was typically marketed as dial-around 101-xxxx service. NANPA maintains separate lists of carrier codes for feature groups 'B' and 'D' as not all long distance providers support both standards.|$|E
50|$|Dekena, a {{computer}} programmer prior to entering politics, was elected for the National Alliance Party at the 2007 election.

He {{was one of several}} ministers to <b>switch</b> <b>support</b> to Peter O'Neill when he successfully ousted Somare in August 2011, and retained his portfolio in the new O'Neill government. Dekena was re-elected at the 2012 election for the Papua New Guinea Party, after which he went into opposition and served as Shadow Minister for Lands and Physical Planning. On 15 January 2013, Nick Kuman, who Dekena had defeated in 2007, successfully challenged Dekena's re-election in the National Court on the grounds of illegal marking of ballot papers; the court unseated Dekena and after a recount that November declared Kuman to have been rightfully elected. Dekena was denied leave to appeal to appeal to the Supreme Court.|$|E

50|$|The Juniper 4200 {{series is}} built on modular chassis used for data centers and large {{corporate}} offices.

These switches are stackable, and 10 {{of them can be}} linked to create a single virtual <b>switch</b> <b>supporting</b> up to 480 10/100/1000 Ethernet ports, forty 1G Ethernet or twenty 10G Ethernet ports. EX4200 Virtual Chassis can be expanded by using optical ports and/or ethernet ports (VCE - Virtual Chassis Expansion), thus allowing to manage device as a single switch even if locations are separated. Optical modules support up to 80 kilometers range. All EX4200 family <b>switches</b> <b>support</b> power over Ethernet (PoE). The T series supports 802.3af PoE (up to 15.4W/port) on a subset of ports. The PX series <b>switches</b> <b>support</b> 802.3at PoE+ (up to 30W/port) on all ports.

50|$|In 2004, Democrats Abroad chose its {{delegates to}} the Democratic National Convention via a caucus system, similar to the Iowa caucuses. Caucuses are {{different}} from primaries. In the latter, people show up, vote, and go home. In a caucus, different areas or rooms are available for each candidate so {{that his or her}} supporters can gather and discuss their candidate's strengths and weaknesses. Caucusgoers who are unsure of their choice can move from room to room to hear about multiple candidates. Straw polls may be taken during the process. Eventually, all the caucusgoers meet in a plenary session and representatives from each room give a short presentation on why his or her candidate should be the Democratic nominee. Then a vote is taken. If some candidates' support is below a certain threshold, that candidate is eliminated and everyone is given the opportunity to <b>switch</b> <b>support.</b> Then a final vote is taken and the number of delegates for each candidate is determined, proportional to his or her share of the vote. The final step consists of the actual election of the delegates pledged to each candidate.|$|E
50|$|Multiplayer on Minecraft is {{available}} through player-hosted and business-hosted servers and enables multiple players to interact and {{communicate with each other}} on a single world. Players can run their own servers or use a hosting provider. Single-player worlds have local area network support, allowing players to join worlds on locally interconnected computers without a server setup. Minecraft multiplayer servers are guided by server operators, who have access to server commands such as setting the time of day and teleporting players around. Operators can also set up restrictions concerning which usernames or IP addresses are allowed to enter the server. Multiplayer servers offer players a wide range of activities, with some servers having their own unique rules and customs. Player versus player (PvP) can also be enabled to allow fighting between players. Many servers today have custom plugins that enable the player and the server to do many different things that are not normally possible. In 2013, Mojang announced Minecraft Realms, a server hosting service intended to enable players to run server multiplayer games easily and safely without the hassle of setting up their own. Realms varies from a standard server in that only invited players can join the server, and that they do not use a server IP. Realms server owners can invite up to twenty people to play on their realm; however, the server can only have ten people online at a time, and does not support user-made plugins. As announced at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2016, Realms will enable Minecraft to support cross-platform play between Windows 10, iOS, and Android versions starting in June 2016, with Xbox One and Nintendo <b>Switch</b> <b>support</b> to come later in 2017, and eventually support for virtual reality devices. On July 31, 2017, Microsoft released the beta version of the update allowing cross-platform play, known as Better Together.|$|E
40|$|BNR and Harvard have jointly {{designed}} {{an experimental}} ATM switch called CreditSwitch with sixteen 622 -Mbps ports. Expected to be operational in early 1995, the switch will support credit-based flow control and full-speed multicast. This paper gives {{a brief overview}} of the switch architecture and its design goals. 1. Introduction ATM switches will need a new level of sophistication to handle a high-volume mix of bursty data and multimedia traffic under, respectively, ABR ("Available Bit Rate") and CBR ("Constant Bit Rate) or VBR ("Variable Bit Rate") services. Such traffic will require <b>switch</b> <b>support</b> for scheduling, policing, congestion control, and multicast. Not only should a <b>switch</b> <b>support</b> these features, but it should support them in a cost-effective manner. Harvard and Bell-Northern Research (BNR) have designed an experimental ATM switch with sixteen 622 -Mbps (Mega bit per second) ports to study new switching methods to meet these requirements.
