40|$|One of {{the main}} {{economic}} reasons behind regional trade blocks is to allow their regional members to benefit from economic cooperation and comparative advantages. In 1980, Bangladesh had suggested a regional cooperative body of South Asian leaders, which then led {{to the establishment of}} the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in 1985, the adoption of the <b>SAARC</b> <b>Preferential</b> <b>Trading</b> <b>Arrangement</b> (SAPTA) in 1993, and the agreement on the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) in 2004. This paper focuses on a review of the progress made with SAFTA, what Bangladesh’s prospects are in SAFTA, and how SAFTA can be made more active. It provides the historical background about the various initiatives within South Asia, reviews the actual trade data, and reviews the main trade restrictions within SAFTA.

40|$|What are {{the choices}} the Asia-Pacific {{community}} will face if it proceeds {{further down the}} path of developing <b>preferential</b> regional <b>trading</b> <b>arrangements?</b> Fragmentation of the region into <b>preferential</b> <b>trading</b> <b>arrangements</b> on a bilateral or subregional basis promises relatively little economic gain and considerable risk of increased <b>trade</b> conflict. Larger <b>preferential</b> <b>trading</b> blocs, spanning the whole of East Asia, the Western Pacific, or the APEC membership, offer greater potential economic benefits but also face formidable political obstacles. In this study, Scollay and Gilbert weigh the economic consequences of {{the increased use of}} <b>preferential</b> <b>trading</b> <b>arrangements</b> in the Asia-Pacific region, whether these develop on the basis of trans-Pacific cooperation or solely within the East Asian or Western Pacific sub-regions. They evaluate the economic effects of both the existing proposals for new bilateral and multilateral agreements and of more far-reaching developments involving the creation of a substantial trading bloc or blocs in the region. Comparisons between the economic effects of establishing such bloc(s) in the region and the effects of achieving APEC's Bogor goals on the basis of "open regionalism" suggest that the latter approach continues to offer a worthwhile alternative. The study demonstrates that the benefits of global free trade dominate those available from establishment of any combination of major blocs or from APEC's "open regionalism". ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the welfare {{implications of a}} discriminatory <b>preferential</b> <b>trading</b> <b>arrangement</b> in a general equilibrium model where imports are differentiated by region of origin and terms of trade are fixed. The relationship between the initial (pre-reform) relative volume of trade with the potential partner and welfare changes is theoretically ambiguous. Applied general equilibrium analysis of Egyptian trade illustrates that potential Egyptian welfare gains from a European PTA are modest. Experiments altering the composition of Egyptian trading patterns show that trade creation and diversion are non-monotonic, concave functions of the benchmark share of trade with the PTA partner. Nonetheless, aggregate welfare gains rise with the initial partner trade share. Thus, in the particular case considered here, the more focused Egypt's trade patterns are on the EU, the more the country would gain from a <b>preferential</b> <b>trading</b> <b>arrangement.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} how various <b>preferential</b> <b>trading</b> <b>arrangements</b> {{deal with}} agriculture liberalization and examines a few case studies highlighting the provisions on agriculture.

It finds that while the tariff reduction on all goods, including agriculture, in ASEAN provides a marked advantage from the MFN tariff rates, intra-ASEAN agriculture trade have not been all that significant. Most of the growth in the intra-ASEAN trade had come from trade in industry; and if total agriculture trade had expanded, much of it was due to trade outside the region. The paper argues that AFTA, by original design, had not really been made to boost intra-regional agriculture trade, but rather to facilitate the inter-industry trade arising out of the vertically integrated network of manufacturing transnational corporations.

40|$|This article {{outlines}} a {{new approach}} for analyzing the role of trade in promoting industrial development.

And are there any differences in this aspect between custom unions and other forms of <b>preferential</b> <b>trading</b> <b>arrangements?</b> These questions are well debated and have divided international trade researchers into two camps, one in favour for <b>preferential</b> <b>trading</b> <b>arrangements</b> and the other side against them. I have used well acknowledged researchers in the area of international trade theory to make a literature study of the above mentioned key elements in the debate.

Free trade association seems to be welfare enhancing in general, with a few exceptions. I have found that the crucial points of what affect Free Trade Agreements will have on trade liberalization seems to be whether they are open or closed, how asymmetric the world is and the size of the trading blocs. The matter concerning custom unions are more alarming and seems to harm further trade liberalization in many aspects but this area also needs more research to give more reliable answers...|$|R

In turn, this gives rise to another key concern: its potential use as a protectionist tool. To achieve the East Asian vision of a community, any RTA it would endeavor to establish should set a rational, enabling regime of ROO that would facilitate even as it attempts to prevent trade deflection, with enough safeguards for inclusive development both within and across countries in the region.

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{proliferation}} of proposals for bilateral free trade areas (FTAs) in East Asia in recent times. These initiatives fly {{in the face of}} the long-standing support of key players in the region such as Japan for the MFN-based non-discriminatory trading system and the commitment to non-discriminatory trade liberalisation and reform within APEC. As China establishes its role in the WTO, its interests are very much in an open global trading system. The paper argues that the core interests of East Asian economies remain in non-discriminatory global <b>trading</b> <b>arrangements</b> and prosecuting those interests within the Doha Round of trade negotiations. It suggests that a way forward in sorting out the trade-distorting and protectionist effects of FTAs would be for East Asian economies to take a lead in negotiations on strengthening the WTO rules on <b>preferential</b> <b>trade</b> <b>arrangements.</b> In terms of global economic welfare, the only good preferential arrangement is one that disappears in time.

40|$|Economic theory {{suggests}} that a common market between two or more countries improves overall well-being, but it creates winners and losers in each country. Recent empirical findings also show that the overall impact of a common market on per capita income depends on the similarity of economic development between member countries. A common market among developed countries results in the convergence of per capita income while a common market among developing countries results in the divergence of per capita income. The difference in outcome, some economists suggest, is due to variations in comparative advantage between member states {{and the rest of}} the world. But the theory of comparative advantage does not fully explain the results of the de facto common market between Ethiopia and Eritrea (1991 - 1998). The empirical findings of this study demonstrate that the Ethio-Eritrea <b>preferential</b> <b>trade</b> <b>arrangement</b> benefited Eritrea and harmed Ethiopia.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this dissertation {{is to examine the}} effect of recent trade policy changes on trade and economic growth for southern Africa. This is accomplished by using a dynamic panel data modeling approach to examine the effect of openness on economic growth during the 1990 s.
