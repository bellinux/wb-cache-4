500|$|As the 1930s dawned, the B's New York {{passenger}} service faced {{two significant}} competitive disadvantages, {{compared to the}} Pennsylvania Railroad. First, the B lacked direct access to Manhattan, resulting in slower overall travel time. Second, the Pennsylvania's move in the early 1930s to replace steam power with modern, smokeless electric service along its entire New YorkWashington mainline was met with enthusiastic public approval. The B responded by introducing Diesel locomotives, air conditioning, and streamlining on its New York trains. On June 24, 1935, the B inaugurated the first lightweight, streamlined train in the eastern U.S., when it began operating a re-christened Royal Blue train between Washington and New York. When the specially modified 4-4-4-type steam locomotive prepared for the run proved less than satisfactory in terms of stability at speed, a new EMC 1800 hp B-B diesel-electric engine with a carbody by General Electric and mechanicals by Electro-Motive Corporation and numbered 50 replaced it, which was yet another first east of the Mississippi River. [...] In 1937 this was replaced with the more demurely <b>streamlined</b> <b>locomotive</b> #51 and booster 51x, among {{the first of the}} new E-Series road Diesel locomotives from General Motors' Electro Motive Company. Previously, early experiments with internal combustion engines to replace steam in railroad applications included short, articulated trainsets (such as Burlington's Pioneer Zephyr and Union Pacific's M-10000), double-head sets of [...] "boxcab" [...] locomotives (developed by EMC) used to power the 1936 version of the AT (Santa Fe) Super Chief (similar to number 50), and the cab/booster unit combinations developed with Union Pacific's M-10002 and M-10003 - M-10006 trainsets. The E units took the most advanced developments of Diesel locomotive technology and made them available to all operators using the consists of their choice, and allowed Number 50 and the aluminum trainset to migrate west to subsidiary Alton, where it operated as the Abraham Lincoln. [...] The earliest adopters of the new E units demonstrated the improved flexibility, efficiency and reduced maintenance costs of Diesel power in daily service compared to steam and gave impetus to the Dieselization of the railroad industry.|$|E

Each of the eight {{geometric}} shapes has a meaning. The rectangular base represents the core of education. The two side-by-side cylinders represent the wheels of progress while the triangle represents a mode of transportation designed for speed. The small cylinder that supports the hoop signifies fortitude and determination and the hoop itself stands for the circle of life. The long pole represents ambition and the hollow scroll stands for the scroll of knowledge. The artist dedicated the sculpture to today's youth.|$|E

5000|$|Many steam {{locomotives}} were streamlined {{during this}} time to attract passengers, and the first steam <b>streamlined</b> <b>locomotive</b> was the New York Central's Commodore Vanderbilt. Nonetheless, some of these steam locomotives became very fast - some were said to exceed 120 mph on a regular basis.

50|$|During the 1930s, the {{streamlining}} {{of locomotives}} was fashionable in Europe and the United States of America. It was proposed to adopt streamlining {{on some of}} the Class 23 locomotives which were intended for the Cape mainline and the manufacturers were requested to submit estimates to that effect. Since streamlining would increase the cost by Â£500 per locomotive and increase the weight by approximately 2 lt t, the idea was abandoned, {{especially in light of the}} negligible performance benefit of streamlining at the official maximum 55 mph goods train speeds on Cape gauge and the reduced accessibility of working parts on a <b>streamlined</b> <b>locomotive.</b>|$|E
