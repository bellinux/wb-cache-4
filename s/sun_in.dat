5|$|Because the Earth's {{orbit around}} the Sun is also elliptical, the Earth's {{distance}} from the Sun similarly varies throughout the year. This affects the apparent size of the <b>Sun</b> <b>in</b> the same way, {{but not as much}} as does the Moon's varying distance from Earth. When Earth approaches its farthest distance from the <b>Sun</b> <b>in</b> early July, a total eclipse is somewhat more likely, whereas conditions favour an annular eclipse when Earth approaches its closest distance to the <b>Sun</b> <b>in</b> early January.|$|E

5|$|When the Italian {{physicist}} Galileo Galilei first {{observed the}} planet in the early 17thcentury, he found it showed phases like the Moon, varying from crescent to gibbous to full and vice versa. When Venus is furthest from the <b>Sun</b> <b>in</b> the sky, it shows a half-lit phase, {{and when it is}} closest to the <b>Sun</b> <b>in</b> the sky, it shows as a crescent or full phase. This could be possible only if Venus orbited the Sun, and this was among the first observations to clearly contradict the Ptolemaic geocentric model that the Solar System was concentric and centred on Earth.|$|E

5|$|Asteroseismic {{analysis}} of the star reveals it is approximately 10% more massive than the Sun and significantly older, at around 6.34 billion years. The radius of the star is 36% {{greater than that of}} the Sun and it is 90% more luminous. The star contains twice the abundance of iron relative to hydrogen of the Sun and is therefore described as metal-rich. Mu Arae is also more enriched than the <b>Sun</b> <b>in</b> the element helium.|$|E

5|$|Earth is {{the third}} planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4 billion years ago. Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, {{especially}} the Sun and the Moon, Earth's only natural satellite. Earth revolves around the <b>Sun</b> <b>in</b> 365.26 days, a period known as an Earth year. During this time, Earth rotates about its axis about 366.26 times.|$|E

5|$|Finally {{there is}} often a need to correct for the {{apparent}} movement of the stars. On the timescale of human civilisation the stars have largely maintained the same position relative to each other. Each night they appear to rotate around the celestial poles due to the Earth's rotation about its axis. However, the Earth spins rather like a spinning top. Not only does the Earth rotate, it wobbles. The Earth's axis takes around 25,800 years to complete one full wobble. The effect to the archaeoastronomer is that stars did not rise over the horizon in the past in the same places as they do today. Nor did the stars rotate around Polaris as they do now. In the case of the Egyptian pyramids, it has been shown they were aligned towards Thuban, a faint star in the constellation of Draco. The effect can be substantial over relatively short lengths of time, historically speaking. For instance a person born on 25 December in Roman times would have been born with the <b>sun</b> <b>in</b> the constellation Capricorn. In the modern period a person born on the same date would have the <b>sun</b> <b>in</b> Sagittarius due to the precession of the equinoxes.|$|E
5|$|HD 2039 is {{a stable}} G-type star, meaning it shines with white light {{that can be}} seen in the <b>Sun.</b> <b>In</b> terms of mass, the star {{exhibits}} almost identical properties. HD 2039 exhibits a radius approximately 40 percent larger than the Sun's. The star is slightly hotter than the Sun; while HD 2039 has a temperature of 5935 K, the Sun's surface temperature lies nearly 200 kelvins lower at 5778 K. HD 2039 is unusually metal-rich, which has attracted the attention of astrophysicists.|$|E
5|$|HD 28185 b is an {{extrasolar planet}} {{approximately}} 138 light-years away from Earth {{in the constellation}} of Eridanus. The planet was discovered orbiting the Sun-like star HD 28185 in April 2001 {{as a part of}} the CORALIE survey for southern extrasolar planets, and its existence was independently confirmed by the Magellan Planet Search Survey in 2008. HD 28185 b orbits its <b>sun</b> <b>in</b> a circular orbit that is at the inner edge of its star's habitable zone.|$|E

5|$|However, {{some have}} {{suggested}} that the Moon nonetheless deserves to be called a planet. In 1975, Isaac Asimov noted that the timing of the Moon's orbit is in tandem with the Earth's own orbit around the Sun—looking down on the ecliptic, the Moon never actually loops back on itself, and in essence it orbits the <b>Sun</b> <b>in</b> its own right.|$|E

5|$|Most large {{objects in}} orbit around the Sun lie near the plane of Earth's orbit, known as the ecliptic.
