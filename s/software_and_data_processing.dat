The Ziarat district has the highest Human Development Index of all districts in the province.The Founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah spent his last days of his life in Ziarat Residency in Ziarat.Balochistan is under developed province, and its literacy rate is low tan 37 percent.A school is a basic learning station for the students where they develop their skills and get knowledge through facilities which help the students. Physical and human resources like books (library), teachers, lectures, notes, black board which is use to demonstrate the matter, school charts related with the subjects taught in the school or class room, are more auxiliary to enhance the knowledge for disciplinary for nation in the class rooms. Desks, Chair and Table are the essential factors. The writing activities shows the gaining of knowledge to whom is it transferred. The combination of different types of equipment provides good quality results also passion to express their abilities to serve institution. The facilities which can provide better results in any institution are building material possess the qualities of leading the children in a good manner such as charts, white board, explaining dairies, comfortable desks etc. The main objective {{of this study was to}} determine the quantity and quantity of physical resources available in government Schools of Tehsil Ziarat and this study determined the quantity of resources and to assess the quality of assets and resources available in Government boys and girls Schools of Tehsil Ziarat. In order to fulfill the objectives and achieve the major outputs, the study drew upon secondary and primary resource materials for data collection. Varieties of techniques were developed for gathering such data. Both primary and secondary information were collected. The secondary data was related to Baluchistan education department and related schools.The primary data was collected from ten government high and middle schools of Ziarat. Checklist was also used and information throughout checklist was collected from head teachers. Two types of questionnaire was prepared, One was specified for teachers and students, and other was specified for head teachers. The information gathered from primary and secondary data was analyzed through SPSS <b>software.</b> <b>And</b> <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> was carried out. According to result, most of government school building condition was not satisfied. 63.7% respondents said their school building is not in good condition boundary wall of school is an essential element in infrastructure of any school. Only 63.9% school has its boundary wall, 35.7% school, lack of boundary wall. 8.9% school had wash rooms for teachers 38.2 % school had washrooms for students. The condition of washroom in girls’ schools was more satisfactory then boy’s schools. Regarding desks and chairs only 39% schools were satisfied with the quality of desks and 62.6% respondent were not satisfied. The supply of desks for student, were not seen on regular basis the budget allocated for furniture was very limited. In school child spend approximately 5 to 6 hours. They need water and food for the recovery of their energy. 60% school were lack of drinking water and no drinking water was available for children. Most of the children brought water themselves from their homes. This issue was similar in boys and girls school. Only 39% of respondent were satisfied with drinking water. 50% schools had water tanks for storage of water & 50% lack water tanks. It is concluded that schools need facilities to service educational purpose and which can facilitate teaching & learning. The less number of facilities can’t support experimentation and demonstration in learning, can’t support scientific experimentation and to provide comport to the students. Inadequate facilities in Ziarat schools had negative impact on life of building, effectiveness of student and teachers. Facilities management is an integral part of school management. There is a need to aware the Head Teacher and teachers regarding facilities management. The education department of Balochistan should provide training to Head teacher regarding facilities management. Head teacher should form a special committee of teachers.

All relevant error sources in GNSS-derived IWV is therefore essential to be investigated. We present two approaches, a statistical and a theoretical analysis, for the assessment of the uncertainty of the IWV. It will be implemented to the GNSS IWV data stream for GRUAN in order to obtain a specific uncertainty for each data point. In addition, specific recommendations are made to GRUAN on hardware, <b>software,</b> <b>and</b> <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> practices to minimize the IWV uncertainty. By combining the uncertainties associated with the input variables in the estimations of the IWV, we calculated the IWV uncertainties for several GRUAN sites with different weather conditions. The results show a similar relative importance of all uncertainty contributions where the uncertainties in the Zenith Total Delay (ZTD) dominate the error budget of the IWV contributing with over 75 % to the total IWV uncertainty. The impact of the uncertainty associated with the conversion factor between the IWV and the Zenith Wet Delay (ZWD) is proportional to the amount of water vapour and increases slightly for moist weather conditions. The GRUAN GNSS IWV uncertainty data will provide a quantified confidence to be used for the validation of other measurement techniques, taking the uncertainty into account from diurnal to decadal time scales...|$|E

Also, it discusses the planning, execution, data processing and analysis phases of laser scanning activities, with emphasis given on geo-referencing, mesh model generation and cross-section extraction. Specific case studies are considered based on two construction sites in Greece. Particularly, the potential of the method is examined for checking the tunnel profile, producing volume computations and validating the smoothness/thickness of shotcrete layers at an excavation stage and during the completion of excavation support and primary lining.

The mainland radars were constructed about 30  years ago, based on technological solutions of that time. The science drivers of today, however, require a more flexible instrument, which allows {{measurements to be made}} from the troposphere to the topside ionosphere and gives the measured parameters in three dimensions, not just along a single radar beam. The possibility for continuous operation is also an essential feature. To facilitatefuture science work with a world-leading IS radar facility, planning of a new radar system started first with an EU-funded Design Study (2005 – 2009) and has continued with a follow-up EU FP 7 EISCAT_ 3 D Preparatory Phase project (2010 – 2014). The radar facility will be realised by using phased arrays, and a key aspect is the use of advanced <b>software</b> <b>and</b> <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> techniques. This type of software radar will act as a pathfinder for other facilities worldwide. The new radar facility will enable the EISCAT_ 3 D science community to address new, significant science questions as well as to serve society, which is increasingly dependent on space-based technology and issues related to space weather.

In January 2007, we installed a new NDIR analyzer (Li- 7000), which became our main CO 2 analyzer. The instrumental system is briefly described, additionally to the acquisition/control <b>software</b> <b>and</b> raw <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> numerical code, which have been developed by us. Some details are provided about the processes used to transfer the WMO scale to the atmospheric CO 2 measurements, together with the instrumental response function used, its determination and uncertainty. We perform an uncertainty propagation analysis, obtaining a standard uncertainty of 0. 035 ppm for the consistency of our atmospheric CO 2 measurements with the WMO-X 2005 CO 2 scale. Secondly, the CH 4 program is considered. The new numerical codes developed by us to integrate peak area and to process calibrations are very briefly described. Finally, our intercomparison activities are mentioned.
