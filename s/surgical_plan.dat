50|$|In {{order to}} make a <b>surgical</b> <b>planning,</b> one would need a 3D image of the patient. The {{starting}} point was made by G. Hounsfield in the 1970s, by using CT in order to record data about the anatomical situation of the patients. In the 1980s, advances were made by the radiologist M. Vannier and his team, by creating the first computed three-dimensional reconstruction from a CT dataset. In the early 1990s, the <b>surgical</b> <b>planning</b> was performed by using stereolithographic models. During the late 1990s, the first full computer-based virtual <b>surgical</b> <b>planning</b> was made for osteotomies, and then transferred to the operating theatre by a navigation system.|$|R
40|$|Imaging, sensing and {{computing}} technologies {{which are}} being introduced {{to aid in the}} planning and execution of surgical procedures are providing orthopaedic surgeons with a powerful new set of tools for improving clinical accuracy, reliability, and patient outcomes while reducing costs and operating times. Current computer-assisted surgical systems typically include a measurement process for collecting patient-specific medical data, a decision making process for generating a <b>surgical</b> <b>plan,</b> a registration process for aligning the <b>surgical</b> <b>plan</b> to the patient, and an action process for accurately achieving the goals specified in the plan.

40|$|Fetal surgery {{has become}} a {{clinical}} reality, with interventions for twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) and spina bifida demonstrated to improve outcome. Fetal imaging is evolving, {{with the use of}} 3 D ultrasound and fetal MRI becoming more common in clinical practise. Medical imaging analysis is also changing, with technology being developed to assist surgeons by creating 3 D virtual models that improve understanding of complex anatomy, and prove powerful tools in <b>surgical</b> <b>planning</b> and intraoperative guidance. We introduce the concept of computer-assisted <b>surgical</b> <b>planning,</b> and present the results of a systematic review of image reconstruction for fetal <b>surgical</b> <b>planning</b> that identified six articles using such technology.

30|$|Discussion: Being an outpatient, {{minimally}} invasive method, office hysteroscopy is very useful in etiological diagnosis {{and management of}} abnormal uterine bleeding secondary to intracavitary lesions.

Clinically available CBCT images are used for <b>surgical</b> <b>planning.</b> However, its relatively low resolution renders the identification of the facial nerve difficult. In this work, we present a supervised learning approach to enhance facial nerve image information from CBCT. A supervised learning approach based on multi-output random forest was employed to learn the mapping between CBCT and micro-CT images. Evaluation was performed qualitatively and quantitatively by using the predicted image as input for a previously published dedicated facial nerve segmentation, and cochlear implantation <b>surgical</b> <b>planning</b> software, OtoPlan. Results show the potential of the proposed approach to improve facial nerve image quality as imaged by CBCT and to leverage its segmentation using OtoPlan...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the vertical changes of the lip and perioral soft tissue, following orthognathic surgery in skeletal class III patients by a cephalometric analysis of a cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). Methods: A total of 20 skeletal class III patients, who had bimaxillary surgery with Le Fort 1 osteotomy and bilateral sagittal split ramus osteotomy, were included in this study. The <b>surgical</b> <b>plan</b> for maxilla was posterosuperior impaction with the anterior nasal spine, as the rotation center. Further, the <b>surgical</b> <b>plan</b> for mandible was also posterosuperior movement. The soft tissue changes between lateral cephalogram and CBCT were compared.

40|$|A new {{integrated}} computer system, the 3 -dimensional (3 D) {{virtual reality}} <b>surgical</b> <b>planning</b> and simulation workbench for orthognathic surgery (VRSP), is presented. Five major functions are implemented in this system: post-processing and reconstruction of computed tomographic (CT) data, transformation of 3 D unique coordinate system geometry, generation of 3 D color facial soft tissue models, virtual <b>surgical</b> <b>planning</b> and simulation, and presurgical prediction of soft tissue changes. The basic mensuration functions, such as linear and spatial measurements, are also included. The <b>surgical</b> <b>planning</b> and simulation {{are based on}} 3 D CT reconstructions, whereas soft tissue prediction {{is based on an}} individualized, texture-mapped, color facial soft tissue model. The surgeon "enters" the virtual operatory with virtual reality equipment, "holds" a virtual scalpel, and "operates" on a virtual patient to accomplish actual <b>surgical</b> <b>planning,</b> simulation of the surgical procedure, and prediction of soft tissue changes before surgery. As a final result, a quantitative osteotomy-simulated bone model and predicted color facial model with photorealistic quality can be visualized from any arbitrary viewing point in a personal computer system.
