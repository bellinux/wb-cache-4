40|$|While acute aortic {{regurgitation}} is {{the most}} common valvular lesion associated with aortic <b>sinus</b> <b>of</b> Valsalva aneurysms, this report describes the pathological findings in five patients in whom primary right-sided valve dysfunction was simulated by <b>sinus</b> <b>of</b> Valsalva aneurysms. In two patients aneurysms <b>of</b> the noncoronary <b>sinus</b> projected into the right atrium {{at the level of the}} tricuspid valve and caused tricuspid in-competence. In three patients aneurysms <b>of</b> the right <b>sinus</b> <b>of</b> Valsalva projected into the right ventricle im-mediately below the pulmonic valve and caused pulmonary outflow tract obstruction.

In addition to valvular dysfunction, two patients had conduction disturbances and two, right coronary arterial occlusions found to be the result of aneurysms.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Despite the {{importance}} of the morphology <b>of</b> the <b>sinus</b> <b>of</b> Valsalva in the behavior of heart valves and the proper irrigation of coronary arteries, the study <b>of</b> these <b>sinuses</b> from medical imaging is still limited to manual radii measurements. This paper aims to present an automatic method to measure the <b>sinuses</b> <b>of</b> Valsalva on medical images, more specifically on cine MRI and Xray CT. METHODS: This paper introduces an enhanced method to automatically localize and extract each <b>sinus</b> <b>of</b> Valsalva edge and its relevant points. Compared to classical active contours, this new image approach enhances the edge extraction <b>of</b> the <b>Sinus</b> <b>of</b> Valsalva. Our process not only allows image segmentation but also a complex study of the considered region including morphological classification, metrological characterization, valve tracking and 2 D modeling. RESULTS: The method was successfully used on single or multiplane cine MRI and aortic CT angiographies. The localization is robust and the proposed edge extractor is more efficient than the state-of-the-art methods (average success rate for MRI examinations= 84 % ± 24 %, average success rate for CT examinations= 89 % ± 11 %). Moreover, deduced measurements are close to manual ones. CONCLUSIONS: The software produces accurate measurements <b>of</b> the <b>sinuses</b> <b>of</b> Valsalva.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe {{past decade}} has {{witnessed}} considerable improvement in implantation techniques for percutaneous closure <b>of</b> ruptured <b>sinus</b> <b>of</b> Valsalva aneurysm. This study was undertaken to compare the immediate results and mid-term follow-up of traditional surgery and percutaneous closure <b>of</b> ruptured <b>sinus</b> <b>of</b> Valsalva aneurysm in China. MethodsBetween January 1993 and January 2013, a total of 35 patients with ruptured <b>sinus</b> <b>of</b> Valsalva aneurysm were enrolled for attempted closure in our institution. Twenty patients (57. 1 %) underwent surgical repair and the other 15 patients (42. 9 %) underwent percutaneous closure. ResultsNineteen patients (95. 0 %) in the surgical group had complete closure and 14 patients (93. 3 %) in the percutaneous closure group were treated successfully (p= 0. 681). Twelve patients with ruptured <b>sinus</b> <b>of</b> Valsalva aneurysm combined with subarterial ventricular septal defect (VSD) underwent surgical repair concomitantly. Two patients in the percutaneous closure group were treated for ruptured <b>sinus</b> <b>of</b> Valsalva aneurysm and perimembranous VSD using occluders concomitantly. One case of severe hemolysis developed 8 h after the procedure in the percutaneous closure group. One death and one case of patch leak occurred in the surgical group during hospitalization. The time of hospital stay in the percutaneous closure group was shorter than that in the surgical group (p= 0. 004). The total medical cost <b>of</b> isolated ruptured <b>sinus</b> <b>of</b> Valsalva aneurysm in the percutaneous closure group was lower compared with that in the surgical group (p= 0. 046). During a median follow-up of 15 months (2 – 240 months), there were no deaths, infective endocarditis, device embolization, or malposition. ConclusionsPercutaneous closure is an attractive alternative to surgery in selected patients with ruptured <b>sinus</b> <b>of</b> Valsalva aneurysm for the better clinical advantages and economic benefits...|$|R
