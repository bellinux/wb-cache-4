40|$|This paper {{describes}} the multi-party consultative process of designing <b>safeguards</b> <b>measures</b> and the necessary safeguards infrastructure for the Encapsulation Plant (EP) and the Geological Repository (GR) in Finland. These facilities, now under design and construction, {{are the first}} of this type in the world. After a Decision-in-Principle by the Finnish Government in 2001, the spent nuclear fuel management company Posiva provided a construction license application for the encapsulation plant and geological repository to the Government in December 2012. In November 2015 the Government granted the license to construct the EP and the GR. The operator (Posiva), Finnish State Regulatory Authority (STUK), IAEA and the European Commission are cooperating on developing <b>safeguards</b> <b>measures</b> and on designing the necessary safeguards infrastructure for these facilities. The international and national <b>safeguards</b> <b>measures</b> have to create confidence that no nuclear material is diverted and no undeclared nuclear activities {{take place at the}} facilities. The spent fuel disposed of will not be accessible for verification using traditional <b>safeguards</b> <b>measures.</b> Moreover, the operational phase of the facilities will last over a century, thus the safeguards-related technological infrastructure should be flexible and upgradable. Planning the <b>safeguards</b> <b>measures</b> and designing the necessary safeguards infrastructure during the design phase of the facilities has many benefits. Cost-efficiency is assured by including into the facility design safeguards equipment such as cameras, radiation detectors, cables and conduits etc. The experience gained so far with this project has confirmed once more that the early provision of design information and safeguards by design dialogue between international and national actors is mutually beneficial and essential for the overall success of safeguards...|$|R

40|$|While the WTO Member {{countries}} {{continue to}} increase their FTA arrangements with divergent frameworks, {{they have begun to}} adopt modified WTO trade remedy systems in FTAs. Although the content and degree of these modified systems may not be significant yet, they still set very important precedents, or 'seeds', for 'rule diversification' in the world trading system. Such modification typically aims to further liberalize mutual trade between FTA parties and thereby contribute to a freer world trading system. However, such rule diversification appears to be inconsistent with the mandate of Article XXIV of GATT by worsening economically inferior trade diversion. The reinterpretation of the legal obligations in Article XXIV commensurate with economically more reasonable structures implies that trade remedy rules in FTAs should be applied on a non-discriminatory basis. Moreover, an FTA <b>safeguard</b> <b>measure</b> must precede a WTO <b>safeguard</b> <b>measure</b> to ensure optimal competitive conditions among trading partners.

Nuclear research centres in general pose special problems for international nuclear material control. The total amount of material present isusually distributed over a multitude of individual items and batches. The classical IAEA <b>safeguards</b> <b>measure</b> of periodic MUF (material unaccounted for) determination is impractical. A viable alternative approach is to focus attention only an those few classes of physical inventory which contain {{the bulk of the}} fissile material. Such classes at the KFA Jülich comprise the frech and irradiated fuel assemblies for the two research reactors FRJ- 1 and FRJ- 2, fuel pebbles for the KAHTER critical assembly and stored spent AVR fuel. We will be concerned in the present investigation with developing a safeguards concept for the spent AVR fuel. A large fraction of the total inventory of fissile material at the KFA-Jülich {{is in the form of}} irradiated fuel from the AVR high temperature reactor. This material is accessible to measurement for verification purposes only with considerable difficulty and therefore poses serious technical problems from a safeguards standpoint. With the continuing operation of the AVR, coupled with still unresolved problems of final disposal, theamount of material in this category is increasing steadily. Moreover it is expected that the AVR pebbles will merge with irradiated fuel from the THTR- 3 oo in a large HTR away-fromareactor dry storage installation, also located at the KFA, thus becoming part of a much larger inventory of fissile material. With the gradual decay of short-lived fission products, its potential strategic value will increase steadily, rendering adequate <b>safeguards</b> <b>measures</b> indispensable.
