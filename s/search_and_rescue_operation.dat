5|$|After {{the first}} tower collapsed, FDNY commanders issued {{evacuation}} warnings. Due to technical difficulties with malfunctioning radio repeater systems, many firefighters {{never heard the}} evacuation orders. 9-1-1 dispatchers also received information from callers that was not passed along to commanders on the scene. Within hours of the attack, a substantial <b>search</b> <b>and</b> <b>rescue</b> <b>operation</b> was launched. After months of around-the-clock operations, the World Trade Center site was cleared {{by the end of}} May 2002.|$|E

5|$|On September26, the Hurricane Hunter P2V-3W Neptune {{aircraft}} Snowcloud Five, led by U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander Grover B. Windham, {{was sent}} from Guantánamo Bay to investigate Janet, {{which was at}} the time a Category4 hurricane south of Jamaica. Upon penetration of the hurricane's eyewall at an altitude of 700ft (200m), a final transmission was received from the reconnaissance flight before it presumably crashed in the Caribbean Sea. All 11people on board, including nine crew members and two journalists, were killed. Following the loss of the plane, an extensive <b>search</b> <b>and</b> <b>rescue</b> <b>operation</b> took place over a large area of the Caribbean Sea, with 3,000personnel involved with the search, returning no results. The exact cause of the crash remains unknown, though it is speculated that the plane's altimeter gave an incorrect reading due to the low surrounding barometric pressure. Although four hurricane reconnaissance flights have been lost since operations began in 1943, Snowcloud Five remains the only known loss of a reconnaissance aircraft {{as a result of a}} hurricane in the Atlantic basin, with the other three occurring as a result of Pacific typhoons.|$|E
5|$|With the {{assistance}} of hundreds of volunteers, Aruban investigators conducted an extensive <b>search</b> <b>and</b> <b>rescue</b> <b>operation.</b> American special agents from the FBI, fifty Dutch soldiers and three specially-equipped Dutch Air Force F-16 aircraft participated in the search. In addition to the ground search, divers searched the ocean floor for Holloway's body. Her remains were not found. On December 18, 2007, Aruban prosecutors announced that the case would be closed without any charges made. The Aruban prosecutor's office reopened the case on February 1, 2008, after receiving video footage of Van der Sloot, {{under the influence of}} marijuana, saying that Holloway died on the morning of her disappearance, and that a friend had disposed of her body. Van der Sloot later denied that what he had said was true, and in an interview said that he had sold Holloway into sexual slavery. He later retracted his comments. In 2012, Van der Sloot was convicted of the May 30, 2010, murder of Stephany Flores Ramírez in Lima, Peru.|$|E
5|$|The first {{documented}} fatality {{associated with}} the storm occurred in Taytay, Rizal, after heavy rains on May27 triggered a mudslide that killed an infant and injured three other people. That same day the rains resulted in thick traffic jams in Manila. Strong winds {{in the capital city}} also toppled billboards and electric posts. Floodwaters forced over 600families to evacuate in Valenzuela, a suburb located northwest of Manila. Similarly strong winds in Pangasinan caused widespread power outage to much of the province. Areas in the central parts of the province experienced their worst flooding conditions in at least 60years. Two ferries capsized off of Minalabac, Camarines Sur, killing six people. Sixty-seven others were rescued in the <b>search</b> <b>and</b> <b>rescue</b> <b>operation</b> that followed the incident. Overall, Linfa killed 41people in the Philippines due to flooding. Damage {{associated with the}} tropical storm included ₱66million (US$1.25million) to agriculture and livestock, ₱83.4million (US$1.58million) to fisheries, and ₱42.9million (US$800,000) to infrastructure, equating to a total of ₱192.3million (US$3.65million) in damage in the Philippines. Nationwide, 8,367persons in roughly 1,686families evacuated into 44evacuation centers {{at the height of the}} storm. The floods destroyed 178homes and damaged an additional 2,040.|$|E

25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the crash, a joint <b>search</b> <b>and</b> <b>rescue</b> <b>operation</b> was launched by British and American authorities but was called off at sunset, with only Hanson being rescued.

At 17:30 hours, a telegram from the airliner's captain, sent from Fethiye, arrived at Air France stating that 38 people survived the accident.|$|E
25|$|The aircraft's {{captain was}} killed in the impact and a {{passenger}} died shortly afterwards. Ten people survived the crash, which was the first fatal accident of Braathens SAFE. Amongst the survivors was Rolf Kirkvaag, at the time Norway's most popular radio host. The <b>search</b> <b>and</b> <b>rescue</b> <b>operation</b> was severely hindered by a blizzard and poor visibility. Kirkvaag and another person left the plane after a day and met a rescue party. The investigation concluded that there were neither technical faults with the aircraft nor pilot error, and that {{it was not possible to}} predict the weather conditions which caused the icing.|$|E
25|$|After {{contact was}} lost with the aircraft, it was {{declared}} missing, which prompted a <b>search</b> <b>and</b> <b>rescue</b> <b>operation.</b> A hundred rescue workers were parachuted {{into the area}} where the aircraft disappeared. The search efforts eventually involved sixteen aircraft and 441 people in total. The search was difficult because of the large territory and the inaccessibility of the area. Ground vehicles were not able to reach {{the area where the}} Il-76 disappeared. The high temperatures combined with the low visibility from the thick smoke and trees made the operations difficult, especially for ground units. After two days of searching, the crashed aircraft was finally found.|$|E

25|$|Early in the evening, {{more than}} six hours after the explosion, Kursk failed to {{complete}} a scheduled communication check at 18:00. The Northern Fleet command became concerned and tried to contact Kursk. After repeated failures, at 18:30 they began a <b>search</b> <b>and</b> <b>rescue</b> <b>operation,</b> dispatching aircraft to locate the submarine, which again failed to locate the ship on the surface. At 17:00, an Ilyushin 38 aircraft was dispatched and looked for Kursk for three hours without spotting anything. At 22:30, the Northern Fleet declared an emergency, and the exercise was stopped. Between fifteen and twenty-two vessels of the Northern Fleet, including about 3,000 sailors, began searching for the submarine. Captain Teslenko commanding Mikhail Rudnitsky left port at 00:30.|$|E
25|$|Mehamn AFIS radioed Flight 933 at 13:35:52, but {{received}} no answer. After several attempts, Mehamn AFIS contacted Berlevåg AFIS and Kirkenes Airport, which {{also failed to}} make radio contact. A Widerøe aircraft en route from Honningsvåg to Mehamn also attempted to make contact. The Joint Rescue Coordination Centre of Northern Norway was informed of the situation at 13:41 and immediately coordinated a <b>search</b> <b>and</b> <b>rescue</b> <b>operation.</b> Three groups of the Norwegian Red Cross Search and Rescue Corps were dispatched and ten ships in the area volunteered {{to assist in the}} search. They were supplemented by two search and rescue vessels from the Norwegian Society for Sea Rescue (NSSR); the Royal Norwegian Navy diving vessel Draug; and the Norwegian Coast Guard vessel Horten.|$|E
25|$|A major <b>search</b> <b>and</b> <b>rescue</b> <b>operation</b> was {{coordinated by}} the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), {{involving}} {{as many as}} 15 helicopters {{as well as a}} specialized fixed wing aircraft flown in from Melbourne. The original search area covered an area of some 1500 square kilometers, made difficult by the hilly terrain and dense vegetation. Local residents on motorcycles also offered to help search remote trails. Police officers on horseback also joined the search. AMSA revealed that an emergency beacon had been activated on the aircraft about half an hour before the last contact, but the signal had since been lost. The wreckage was discovered just below a ridge line near Lake Borumba, 36km south west of Gympie on 3 October with none of the occupants having survived the crash.|$|E
