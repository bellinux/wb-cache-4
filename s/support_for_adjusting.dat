40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "During GAO's fiscal year 2001 audit on accounting procedures and internal controls at the Congressional Award Foundation it found several internal control weaknesses related to processing transactions, maintaining supporting documents, and required reporting.

The leadership of the Congressional Award Foundation changed {{near the end of}} the fiscal year 2001, and this transition may have contributed to the weaknesses found during GAO's audit.

30|$|A {{protective}} {{factor that}} has been emphasized in problem gambling is parental monitoring (Hanss et al. 2015). More young students with hearing loss lived apart from their parents to attend the national upper secondary school for the deaf and hard of hearing. They lacked parental monitoring and <b>support.</b> When <b>adjusted</b> <b>for</b> living apart from parents, young people with hearing loss still have a higher LTP for gambling. Problem gambling are not explained by the hearing status of the adolescents, but by their living situation. In this study, living apart without monitoring and support from one’s parents {{seems to be a}} risk factor for problem gambling.|$|R
40|$|Activation-dependent brain {{plasticity}} in humans on a structural level {{has been demonstrated}} in adults after 3 months of training a visio-motor skill. The exact timescale of usage-dependent structural changes, whether days, months, or years, is, however, still de-bated. A {{better understanding of the}} temporal parameters may help elucidate to what extent this type of cortical plasticity contributes to fast adapting cortical processes that may be relevant to learning and effects of treatments. Using voxel-based morphometry, we are able to show that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation de-livered to the superior temporal cortex causes macroscopic cortical changes in gray matter (GM) in the auditory cortex as early as within 5 days of continuous intervention. These structural alter-ations are mirrored by changes in cortical evoked potentials attrib-uted to the GM changes and demonstrate the rapid dynamics of these processes, which occur within a time range characteristic for the onset of behavioral effects induced by a variety of treatment methods for neuropsychiatric diseases. Our finding suggests that cortical plasticity on a structural level in adult humans is already detectable after 1 week, which provides <b>support</b> <b>for</b> fast <b>adjusting</b> neuronal systems, such as spine and synapse turnover, and con-tradicts slow evolving mechanisms, such as neuronal or glial cell genesis...|$|R

40|$|This paper explores factors {{associated}} with employee use of available <b>supports</b> <b>for</b> improving nutrition and activity behaviors. A cross-sectional telephone-survey assessed presence and use of available program, facility, and policy supports. Logistic regression was used to explore associations between job characteristics (e. g., supervising others) and use of available <b>supports,</b> <b>adjusting</b> <b>for</b> demographic characteristics. After adjustment, most supports were associated {{with at least one}} job-related factor. Participants supervising others were more likely to utilize eight supports including personal services for fitness, indoor exercise and shower facilities, and flextime for physical activity. The programs and facilities associated with the most factors were health fairs (e. g., increased likelihood with increased hours worked/week) and indoor exercise and shower facilities (e. g., increased likelihood with increased flexibility at work), respectively. Policies were associated with fewer factors. Since use of many programs and facilities differed based on job-related factors, employers might target supports based on job-related factors.

40|$|Background Observational studies {{consistently}} {{have identified}} that social support is {{negatively associated with}} depression among adolescents. The causal connections between these two factors, however, are not well understood. Does the relationship between social support and depression indicate that social support protects against depression, or that characteristics of these less depressed adolescents {{make it easier for}} them to obtain social support? To address this, this study examines whether social support predicts later depressive symptoms, controlling for earlier clinical presentation. Methods The sample comprised adolescents (nÂ =Â  777) who were assessed as part of the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being. Caregivers and youth provided information about children's clinical characteristics and family background. Propensity scoring was used to <b>adjust</b> <b>for</b> baseline covariates when examining the impact of social support at eighteen months post-baseline on depressive symptoms at three years post-baseline. Results Children who received more social support at eighteen months post-baseline had fewer depressive symptoms at three years post-baseline, even after <b>adjusting</b> <b>for</b> baseline covariates using the propensity score; however, the adjusted effect size was small. Conclusion Previous attempts to study the impact of social <b>support</b> without <b>adjusting</b> <b>for</b> possible confounders have likely inflated the independently predictive role of social support.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} SnipSuggest, {{a system that}} {{provides}} onthe-go, context-aware assistance in the SQL composition process. SnipSuggest aims to help the increasing population of non-expert database users, who need to perform complex analysis on their large-scale datasets, but have difficulty writing SQL queries. As a user types a query, SnipSuggest recommends possible additions to various clauses in the query using relevant snippets collected from a log of past queries. SnipSuggest’s current capabilities include suggesting tables, views, and table-valued functions in the FROM clause, columns in the SELECT clause, predicates in the WHERE clause, columns in the GROUP BY clause, aggregates, and some <b>support</b> <b>for</b> sub-queries. SnipSuggest <b>adjusts</b> its recommendations according to the context: as the user writes more of the query, {{it is able to}} provide more accurate suggestions. We evaluate SnipSuggest over two query logs: one from an undergraduate database class and another from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey database. We show that SnipSuggest is able to recommend useful snippets with up to 93. 7 % average precision, at interactive speed. We also show that SnipSuggest outperforms naïve approaches, such as recommending popular snippets. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a new technique}} for testing the Heckscher-Ohlin model that allows {{for the possibility that}} countries with sufficiently disparate endowments specialize in unique subsets of goods. Results based upon industry-level data reject one-size-fits-all homogeneity in favor of Heckscher-Ohlin specialization. Results also reveal that industry-level data hide substantial intra-industry heterogeneity, violating the assumptions of the model and complicating the interpretation of results from earlier research. A methodology <b>for</b> <b>adjusting</b> industry output to reflect underlying product variation is introduced. Reestimation of the model using adjusted aggregates in place of standard industry classifications provides strong <b>support</b> <b>for</b> Heckscher-Ohlin specialization. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To qualitatively {{explore the}} experiences, {{challenges}} {{and needs of}} {{parents of children with}} traumatic brain injury (TBI) in order to inform future intervention research through incorporation of participant knowledge and experience. Methods: Parents of children with TBI (n= 10) and experienced health professionals in paediatric rehabilitation (n= 5) took part in focus groups or individual interviews. Audio recordings were transcribed verbatim and an inductive thematic analysis performed. Findings: Participants reported that, beyond the impact of the injury on the child, TBI affects the entire family. Parents need to adjust to and manage their child 2 ̆ 7 s difficulties and can also experience significant emotional distress, relationship discord and burden of care, further adding to the challenges of the parenting role. Parents can feel isolated and the importance of empowerment, support and information was emphasized. Coping styles of disengagement and avoidance were often reported, despite acknowledgement that these were not beneficial. Conclusions: Parenting interventions may provide essential <b>support</b> <b>for</b> parents in <b>adjusting</b> to and managing their child 2 ̆ 7 s difficulties and the efficacy of existing programmes needs evaluation. Addressing parent emotional adjustment and coping strategies is vital following paediatric TBI, given the impact on parent well-being and the potential negative effects on child outcomes through reduced parenting effectiveness.

40|$|This thesis argues that, {{under the}} right conditions, the {{expansion}} of international trade flows and increased labour mobility through circular migration have contributed both directly and indirectly to the goals of poverty reduction and sustainable development in the Pacific Forum Island Countries (FICs). An extensive range of both specific and general policy conditions to ensure those outcomes are specified. Based on these conditions, the study suggests a strategic approach {{to the implementation of}} trade liberalisation and circular migration, which offers a clear path for Pacific Island governments to embrace. It involves balancing the pace and staging of liberalisation to ensure that trade reform, migration policy and development goals are well aligned. Such ‘strategic liberalisation’ can embed the fundamentals of competitiveness in FICs, while ensuring that transition costs, regulatory disciplines, and other conditions are in place to allow Pacific communities to benefit from future trading arrangements. The thesis concludes that while FICs need to ambitiously lock in necessary political, economic and trade reforms, developed countries and larger developing countries with whom they trade also need to intensify their efforts to allow sufficient market access, an increase in the temporary migration of Pacific Islanders and adequate capacity-building <b>support</b> <b>for</b> FICs to <b>adjust</b> to and consolidate these trade and migration policy reforms.
