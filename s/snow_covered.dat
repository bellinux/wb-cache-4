5|$|The Arab {{army was}} well-provisioned, with Arab {{accounts}} reporting high mounds of supplies {{piled up in}} their camp, and had even brought along wheat to sow and harvest the next year. The failure of the Arab navy to blockade the city, however, meant that the Byzantines too could ferry in provisions. In addition, the Arab army had already devastated the Thracian countryside during its march and could not rely on it for foraging. The Arab fleet and the second Arab army, which operated in the Asian suburbs of Constantinople, were able to bring in limited supplies to Maslama's army. As the siege drew into winter, negotiations opened between the two sides, extensively reported by Arab sources but ignored by Byzantine historians. According to the Arab accounts, Leo continued to play a double game with the Arabs. One version claims that he tricked Maslama into handing over most of his grain supplies, while another claims that the Arab general was persuaded to burn them altogether, so as to show {{the inhabitants of the}} city that they faced an imminent assault and induce them to surrender. The winter of 718 was extremely harsh; <b>snow</b> <b>covered</b> the ground for over three months. As the supplies in the Arab camp ran out, a terrible famine broke out: the soldiers ate their horses, camels, and other livestock, and the bark, leaves and roots of trees. They swept the snow of the fields they had sown to eat the green shoots, and reportedly resorted to cannibalism and eating their own excrement. Consequently, the Arab army was ravaged by epidemics; with great exaggeration, the Lombard historian Paul the Deacon put the number of their dead of hunger and disease at 300,000.|$|E

40|$|<b>Snow</b> <b>cover</b> {{depletion}} curves {{are required}} for several water management applications of snow hydrology and are often difficult to obtain automatically using optical remote sensing data owing to both frequent cloud <b>cover</b> and temporary <b>snow</b> <b>cover.</b> This study develops a methodology to produce accurate <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> depletion curves automatically using high temporal resolution optical remote sensing data (e. g. Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Aqua MODIS or National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)) by <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> change trajectory analysis. The method consists of four major steps. The first is to reclassify both cloud-obscured land and snow into more distinct subclasses and to determine their <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> status (seasonal <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> or not) based on the <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> change trajectories over the whole snowmelt season. The second step is to derive rules based on the analysis of <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> change trajectories. These rules are subsequently used to determine for a given date, the <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> status of a pixel based on <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> maps {{from the beginning of}} the snowmelt season to that given date. The third step is to apply a decision- tree-like processing flow based on these rules to determine the <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> status of a pixel for a given date and to create daily seasonal <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> maps. The final step is to produce <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> depletion curves using these maps. A case study using this method based on Terra MODIS <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> map products (MOD 10 A 1) was conducted in the lower and middle reaches of the Kaidu River Watershed (19 000 km 2) in the Chinese Tien Shan, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China. High resolution remote sensing data (charge coupled device (CCD) camera data with 19. 5 m resolution of the China and Brazil Environmental and Resources Satellite (CBERS) data (19. 5 m resolution), and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data with 15 m resolution of the Terra) were used to validate the results. The study shows that the seasonal <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> classification was consistent with that determined using a high spatial resolution dataset, with an accuracy of 87 - 91 %. The <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> depletion curves clearly reflected the impact of the variation of temperature and the appearance of temporary <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> on seasonal <b>snow</b> <b>cover.</b> The findings from this case study suggest that the approach is successful in generating accurate <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> depletion curves automatically under conditions of frequent cloud <b>cover</b> and temporary <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> using high temporal resolution optical remote sensing data.

In this study, we used time-lapse digital images to precisely detect {{the extent of}} <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> at nine locations in the boreal forests of Alaska, and to demonstrate the relationship of these ground-truth measurements to satellite indices of <b>snow</b> <b>cover.</b> Our results show that normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVIs) and normalized difference water indices (NDWIs) show significant variations {{at the end and}} beginning periods of continuous snow cover: the NDVIs on the last days of continuous <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> ranged from 0. 12 to 0. 37, and those on the first days of continuous <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> ranged from 0. 16 to 0. 38. The normalized difference snow indices (NDSIs) were also positive during periods of continuous <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> and negative during periods of no <b>snow</b> <b>cover.</b> The NDWIs varied significantly from the beginning to the end of periods of continuous <b>snow</b> <b>cover.</b> This study confirms that continuous <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> is important for accurate phenological studies using NDVIs in the region of the trans-Alaska camera network.

40|$|<b>Snow</b> <b>cover</b> on the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau (QTP) plays a {{significant}} role in the global climate system and is an important water resource for rivers in the high-elevation region of Asia. At present, passive microwave (PMW) remote sensing data are the only efficient way to monitor temporal and spatial variations in snow depth at large scale. However, existing snow depth products show the largest uncertainties across the QTP. In this study, MODIS fractional <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> product, point, line and intense sampling data are synthesized to evaluate the accuracy of <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> and <b>snow</b> depth derived from PMW remote sensing data and to analyze the possible causes of uncertainties. The results show that the accuracy of <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> extents varies spatially and depends on the fraction of <b>snow</b> <b>cover.</b> Based on the assumption that grids with MODIS <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> fraction >  10...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} {{the relationship between}} Indian summer monsoon total rainfall and two parameters from Eurasian <b>snow</b> <b>cover,</b> one being the winter <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> extent and the other the area of spring snowmelt. Satellite-derived Eurasian <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> extent and Indian monsoon rainfall data {{were obtained from the}} NOAA/NESDIS and the India Meteorological Department (IMD) for the period 1966 - 1985. Seasonal cyclic variations of <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> showed a higher swing in both the winter and the spring seasons of the cycle as compared to the remaining seasons {{of the year in the}} lower region of the cycle. The established inverse relation between winter <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> and monsoon rainfall during June to September is further extended. Winter <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> is very strongly correlated with spring snowmelt over Eurasia. Spring snowmelt area is obtained by subtracting the May snow cove...|$|R
