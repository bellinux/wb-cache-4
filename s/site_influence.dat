A standardized tibial diastasis was stabilized with either a locked unreamed tibial nail or a monolateral fixator in a sheep model. Interfragmentary movements and ground reaction parameters were monitored in vivo throughout the healing period. After sacrifice, the tibiae were examined mechanically and histologically. Bending angles and axial torsion at the fracture site were larger in the nail group within the first five weeks post-operatively. Unlike the fixator group, the operated limb in the nail group did not return to full weight bearing during the treatment period. Mechanical and histomorphometrical observations showed significantly inferior bone healing in the nail group compared to the fixator group.

Here {{we report on the}} enzymatic Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of fluorobenzaldehydes as catalyzed by the flavoprotein 4 -hydroxyacetophenone monooxygenase (HAPMO). HAPMO was most active with 4 -amino- and 4 -hydroxybenzaldehydes. With these compounds significant substrate inhibition occurred. Monofluoro- and difluorobenzaldehydes were readily oxidized by HAPMO without substrate inhibition. 19 F NMR analysis revealed that 4 -fluoro-, 2, 6 -difluoro-, 3, 4 -difluoro-, 2 -fluoro- 4 -hydroxy- and 3 -fluoro- 4 -hydroxybenzaldehyde were quantitatively converted by HAPMO to the corresponding fluorophenyl formates. These products spontaneously hydrolyzed to fluorophenols. The HAPMO-mediated conversion of 2 -fluoro-, 3 -fluoro-, 2, 3 -difluoro- and 2, 4 -difluorobenzaldehyde yielded, besides fluorophenols, also minor amounts of fluorobenzoic acids. The high preference of HAPMO for the production of fluorophenols is in disagreement with the rule derived from chemical studies that electron-poor benzaldehydes form mainly benzoic acids.

40|$|The {{ability of}} the {{glucocorticoid}} receptor (GR) to regulate the transcriptional output of genes relies on its interactions with transcriptional coregulators. However, which coregulators are required for GR-dependent activation is context-dependent and can {{be influenced by the}} sequence of the DNA bound by GR and {{by the nature of the}} GR isoform responsible for the regulation of a gene. Here, we screened for GR-interacting proteins for which the interaction signal differed between two GR isoforms GRα and GRγ. These isoforms diverge by a single amino acid insertion in a domain, the lever arm, which adopts DNA sequence-specific conformations. We identify Basic Leucine Zipper ATF-Like Transcription Factor 3 (BATF 3), an AP- 1 family transcription factor, as a GR coregulator whose interaction with GR is modulated by the lever arm. Further, a combination of experiments uncovered that BATF 3 acts as a gene-specific coactivator of GR whose coactivator potency is influenced by the sequence of the GR binding site. Together, our findings suggest that GR isoform and the sequence of GR binding <b>site</b> <b>influence</b> the interaction of GR with BATF 3, which might direct the assembly of gene-specific regulatory complexes to fine-tune the expression of individual GR target genes...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background PII {{proteins}} have {{a fundamental}} {{role in the}} control of nitrogen metabolism in bacteria, through interactions with different PII targets, controlled by metabolite binding and post-translational modification, uridylylation in most organisms. In the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum, the PII proteins GlnB and GlnJ were shown, in spite of their high degree of similarity, to have different requirements for post-translational uridylylation, with respect to the divalent cations, Mg 2 + and Mn 2 +. Results Given the importance of uridylylation in the functional interactions of PII proteins, we have hypothesized that the difference in the divalent cation requirement for the uridylylation is related to efficient binding of Mg/Mn-ATP to the PII proteins. We concluded that the amino acids at positions 42 and 85 in GlnJ and GlnB (in the vicinity of the ATP binding <b>site)</b> <b>influence</b> the divalent cation requirement for uridylylation catalyzed by GlnD. Conclusions Efficient binding of Mg/Mn-ATP to the PII proteins is required for uridylylation by GlnD. Our results show that by simply exchanging two amino acid residues, we could modulate the divalent cation requirement in the uridylylation of GlnJ and GlnB. Considering that post-translational uridylylation of PII proteins modulates their signaling properties, a different requirement for divalent cations in the modification of GlnB and GlnJ adds an extra regulatory layer to the already intricate control of PII function. </p...|$|E
