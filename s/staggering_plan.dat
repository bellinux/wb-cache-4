50|$|The initial {{design was}} altered to {{increase}} the rental profit by twisting four of the flats to point towards Albert Park whilst adding an extra room and an additional rooftop garden. These four apartments were separated {{from the rest of}} the units by a glazed stairwell. The angular or <b>staggered</b> <b>planning</b> of the flats allowed greater privacy to its occupants whilst allowing an outlook to the extensive garden. This was also aided by the situation of the plan on the southern boundary and restricting all internal circulation to the southern balconies.|$|R

25|$|The {{causeway}} carrying Glenmore Trail {{over the}} reservoir was extensively upgraded beginning in 2005, {{as part of}} a $57million project that was completed in 2008. Prior to the improvements, seven lanes (three eastbound and four westbound) crossed the reservoir. The improvements saw construction of a new bridge carrying two lanes from northbound 14StreetSW to westbound Glenmore Trail, and reconstruction of the existing bridge carrying westbound Glenmore Trail. Construction was <b>staggered</b> and <b>planned</b> to minimize disruption to existing traffic. Nine total lanes now cross the reservoir.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} is 102 ft {{high on a}} 71 ft by 42 ft Aalto-inspired <b>staggered</b> ground <b>plan.</b> The construction cost of £100,000 was funded by a bequest from William Stone (1857-1958), {{a former member of}} the college. The original design was later amended to provide privacy for its occupants, who had found that they could see into each other's rooms from their windows; it still retains appealing views of the surrounding area. It was refurbished in 2007-08, when solar panels were also installed on the roof.|$|R

A summary about the previous history of Düppel and the developments of the veterinarian medicine in Europe is added. The architectural change of the whole ground between 1930 and 1990 is discussed through chronologically <b>staggered</b> site <b>plans.</b> The architectural history of the historical buildings Herrenhaus and Brennerei is reconstructed...|$|R

The Director of Riachuelo River Works, Luis Huergo, presented plans {{of his own}} design for a port of <b>staggered</b> docks. This <b>plan,</b> and a British design purchased by local businessman Eduardo Madero, were presented to Congress in June 1882. Obtaining financing from Baring Brothers, {{as well as the}} support of President Roca, Madero's plan received the endorsement of Senator Carlos Pellegrini (one of the Senate's most powerful figures), and it was approved by both houses in October 1882.|$|R
40|$|A {{landslip}} in {{the village}} of Stanton Lees, Derbyshire, UK, was reported in November 2000 following a period of torrential rainfall. The slip resulted in the gradual and progressive down-slope movement of a relatively steeply sloping embankment that had supported an existing gabion retaining wall and a minor road which was subsequently closed to vehicular traffic. This paper describes the site, an interpretation of the ground conditions, onsite monitoring data and the design and construction of the remedial works necessary to return the road to serviceability. The landslip occurred due to the superficial deposits moving over the weathered bedrock under conditions of elevated groundwater following a period of heavy rainfall. Autumn 2000 was the wettest season since local records began in 1870. A stability analysis indicated that the embankment slope was at limiting equilibrium and was particularly sensitive to relatively minor fluctuations in the groundwater levels. The remedial works involved replacing the existing gabion wall with a cantilevered, 600 -mm diameter, bored pile retaining wall that comprised two rows of piles, <b>staggered</b> in <b>plan</b> arrangement, and located along the southern verge of the road...|$|R
40|$|Positron Emission Tomography is a {{technique}} of molecular imaging and provides information about biochemical process within {{the body of a}} patient, it is employed for diagnosis, <b>staggering,</b> and treatment <b>planning.</b> However, the resulting images have high noise levels that may cause difficulties for reading and interpreting the images by medical staff. For this reason, it is necessary to perform a denoising step to achieve better signal to noise ratio. In this paper, an approach is presented to denoise Positron Emission Tomography sinogram images using non-local total variation in the sinogram domain. The images are modeled in the sinogram domain using a Poisson noise model, it is proposed to adapt the SPIRAL algorithm to approximate the objective function to be minimized with separable quadratic functions to include the nonlocal total variation as a regularization term...|$|R
5000|$|The temple has {{a single}} square shaped shrine (garbhagriha) with an east-west orientation, a {{vestibule}} that connects the sanctum (cella or vimana) to the main large open hall (mukhamantapa) that has a <b>staggered</b> square <b>plan</b> and can be entered from five sides; two lateral and one each in the north, south and east. The walls of the shrine and vestibule stand on a base (adisthana) that is composed of five moldings. The superstructure over the sanctum is four-tiered (chatustala arpita). It is crowned by a large domed roof {{that looks like a}} [...] "helmet" [...] (amalaka) and whose shape follows the shape of the shrine (square in this case). The [...] "helmet" [...] is the largest sculptural piece in the temple, it is beautifully carved and well decorated. Atop the dome is a beautiful water-pot like stone structure (kalasha) that forms the pinnacle of the tower. In case of those temples where the original pinnacle is lost, a metallic structure is normally used as a replacement. The tower over the vestibule (sukanasi or [...] "nose), which is actually a protrusion of the main tower, faces east. The open mantapa is large and its ceiling is supported by massive lathe-turned circular pillars. The relief work in the central panel of the hall ceiling is particularly noteworthy and the overall preservation of the temple is good.|$|R
40|$|With {{the serious}} urban {{transport}} challenges that rapid motorization and growth in travel {{demand for the}} city of Beijing have brought, the design and implementation of efficient and equitable urban transport polices has become essential to achieve sustainable development targets. This paper investigates a selection of transport management measures that were introduced following the Beijing 2008 Olympic and Paralympic Games. These include priority development of mass transit systems, private car ownership measures, a <b>staggered</b> rush hour <b>plan,</b> modified charging policies for parking and car restrictions based on license plate numbers. Effects of these measures with respect to growth in vehicle and trip numbers are summarized, then qualitatively evaluated within a proposed framework that covers in one dimension equity and efficiency and in another, social, economic and environmental aspects of transport sustainability. The evaluation process is intended to firstly shed light on the effects of transport management measures according to different sustainability dimensions and secondly to support policymakers involved in the practical design of future transport management measures for Beijing and similar city contexts...|$|R
