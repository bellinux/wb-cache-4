40|$|Primary {{effects of}} road traffic noise on sleep, as derived from EEG, EOG, and EMG, were studied for seven young males (aged 21 – 27) {{in their homes}} along roads with heavy traffic during the night. A more quiet {{experimental}} condition was obtained by mounting <b>sound-insulating</b> <b>material</b> in the window openings, thus reducing the interiors noise level {{by an average of}} 8 dB(A). The present investigation shows that the subjects had not become completely habituated to the noise, although they had lived at least a year at their residences. The noise reduction caused an earlier onset and a prolonged duration of slow was sleep. No effects on REM sleep were seen. The subjective sleep quality was significantly correlated to the noise dose. The equivalent sound pressure level (Leq) did not give the most adequate noise dose description. Better characterizations of the noise exposure were found in the number of car per night producing maximum sound pressure levels exceeding 50 or 55 dB(A) in the bedroom. Arousal reactions of type “body movements” and “changes towards lighter sleep” were induced by the noise of car passage but the percentage of cars inducing an effect was only < 2 % and < 0 • 2 % for the two types of reactions, respectively. The number of spontaneous body movements and sleep stage changes per night showed an increase during the more quiet nights as compared to the noisy nights. The sensitivity to arousal reactions was significantly lower in the present field study than the in the laboratory experiments. A description of the continuous sleep process by a few distinct “sleep stages” is too crude a tool for the detection of the rather subtle changes in the sleeping pattern caused by noise. In the present study an increased sensitivity in the analysis was obtained by dividing stage 2 into three substages...|$|E
