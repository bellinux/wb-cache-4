This is the 2008 update of the 2001 US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation on universal newborn hearing screening. METHODS. The US Preventive Services Task Force weighed the {{benefits and harms of}} universal newborn hearing screening, incorporating new evidence addressing gaps identified in the 2001 US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement. Published literature on this topic was identified (by using Medline and Cochrane databases) and systematically reviewed. RECOMMENDATION. Screen for hearing loss in all newborn infants (B recommendation). Pediatrics 2008; 122 : 143 – 148 ● The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) makes recommendations about preventive care services for patients without recognized signs or symptoms of the target condition. ● It bases its recommendations on a systematic review of the evidence of the benefits and harms and an assessment of the net benefit of the service. ● The USPSTF recognizes that clinical or policy decisions involve more considerations than this body of evidence alone. Clinicians and policy makers should understand the evidence but individualize decision-making to the specific patient or situation. <b>SUMMARY</b> <b>OF</b> <b>RECOMMENDATION</b> AND EVIDENCE The USPSTF recommends screening for hearing loss in all newborn infants (B recommendation). See figure for a <b>summary</b> <b>of</b> the <b>recommendation</b> and suggestions for clinical practice.

The theoretical part deals with syndrome CAN and child's drawing as one of the projective techniques. The empirical part of this diploma work includes the sample usage of child's drawing as the diagnostic technique when dealing with child being abused and neglect. The results of the self-constructed questionnaire provide with the information concerning the possibilities of using child's drawing as the diagnostic technique when dealing with child being abused and neglect. The questionnaires were filled in by the teachers of primary schools in Středočeský region. In connection with this fact I created the <b>summary</b> <b>of</b> <b>recommendations</b> regarding the possibilities of using of child's drawing as one of the diagnostic techniques for detection of the child being abused or neglect.

40|$|Objectives: in this article, we {{describe}} how to include considerations about resource utilization when making recommendations {{according to the}} Grading <b>of</b> <b>Recommendations</b> Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Study design and settings: we focus on challenges with rating the confidence in effect estimates (quality of evidence) and incorporating resource use into evidence profiles and <b>Summary</b> <b>of</b> Findings (SoF) tables. Results: GRADE recommends that important differences in resource use between alternative management strategies should be included along with other important outcomes in the evidence profile and SoF table. Key steps in considering resources in making recommendations with GRADE are the identification of items of resource use that may differ between alternative management strategies and that are potentially important to decision makers, finding evidence for the differences in resource use, making judgments regarding confidence in effect estimates using the same criteria used for health outcomes, and valuing the resource use in terms of costs for the specific setting for which recommendations are being made. Conclusions: with our framework, decision makers {{will have access to}} concise <b>summaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>recommendations,</b> including ratings <b>of</b> the quality of economic evidence, and better understand the implications for clinical decision making...|$|R
