5|$|Chaplin {{had interviewed}} several actresses {{to play the}} blind flower girl but was unimpressed with them all. While seeing a film shoot with bathing women in a Santa Monica beach, he found a casual acquaintance, Virginia Cherrill. Cherrill waved and asked if <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> {{get the chance to}} work with him. After a series of poor auditions from other actresses, Chaplin {{eventually}} invited her to do a screen test. She was the first actress to subtly and convincingly act blind on camera due to her near-sightedness, and Cherrill signed a contract on November 1, 1928.|$|E

Between 1991 and 2000, the pair competed in multiple {{national and international}} championships, including three Olympic Games and two World Equestrian Games. They won one gold medal and four silver medals at the Olympics and one gold and three silvers at the World Equestrian Games. Although known for having a hot temperament, Bonfire mellowed as he aged, becoming one of Van Grunsven's best horses – until she found his replacement, Salinero, {{she did not think}} <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> find a horse to match Bonfire's talent.

In mid-2012, an article from the New York Post reported that Judge Judy was snubbed by the award show by not even being nominated that year despite being the highest-rated court show. In {{an interview with}} Entertainment Tonight (ET) on May 3, 2013, Sheindlin said, [...] "I have my walls full of Daytime Emmy Award nominations."

500|$|Aaliyah {{was known}} to avoid {{answering}} questions regarding R. Kelly following the professional split. During an interview with Christopher John Farley, she was asked if {{she was still in}} contact with him and if <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> work with him again. Farley said Aaliyah responded with a [...] "firm, frosty" [...] 'No' to both of the questions. Vibe magazine said Aaliyah changed the subject anytime [...] "you bring up the marriage with her". A spokeswoman for Aaliyah told the Chicago Sun-Times in 2000 that when [...] "R. Kelly comes up, she doesn't even speak his name, and nobody's allowed to ask about it at all". Kelly later commented that Aaliyah had opportunities to address the pair's relationship after they separated professionally but chose not to.|$|E

500|$|Dickson debuted as the {{character}} {{within the first}} few episodes of the series. Footage of Dickson as Jill appears in the film Taxi Driver. In May 1980, Dickson left the role, with Bond Gideon briefly taking over before Adair portrayed {{the character}} for an additional three years, from 1980 to 1983. Dickson returned to the role in 1983. Melinda Fee served a temporary recast also in 1984, and Adair briefly reprised the role in 1986 as a fill-in for Dickson. In 1987, when asked if <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> leave the character of Jill again, Dickson stated: [...] "I'm planning to branch out, maybe even a miniseries.

500|$|The album sold {{a million}} copies in the United States, and five million worldwide. Taraborrelli felt that at that moment, riding on Madonna's coattails proved {{profitable}} for everyone involved, including Warner Bros. Records, which notched up big sales with a compilation soundtrack album that was basically a showcase for its marginal artists. But still they wanted to [...] "milk-in" [...] the success of Madonna, a view shared by Peter Guber and Jon Peters, executive producers of the film. Hence they felt a worldwide concert tour was the appropriate thing to do, since it would promote both the soundtrack and the film, as well as Madonna's successful third studio album True Blue, released the year before. As Madonna's first world tour, Who's That Girl ended up being a resounding success, although by its end, Madonna declared {{that she did not}} want to hear any of her songs again and she did not know whether <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> write another one. [...] "I returned feeling so burned out and I was convinced that I wouldn't go near music for quite a while", she said.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of the Obama presidency, {{particularly}} during the second term, Michelle Obama was subject to speculation over whether she would run for the presidency herself, similarly to predecessor Hillary Clinton. A potential Michelle Obama candidacy was supported by both Samuel L. Jackson and James Clyburn. On April 6, 2009, CNN did a poll on whether she should run for the presidency in 2020, 83% of responders being opposed to the idea. A May 2015 Rasmussen poll found Obama had 22% of support to Clinton's 56% of winning the Democratic nomination, higher than that of potential candidates Elizabeth Warren, Martin O'Malley and Bernie Sanders. Another poll from that month found 71% of Americans believed that Obama should not run for the presidency, only 14% approving. On January 14, 2016, during a town-hall meeting, President Obama was asked if the First Lady could be talked into running. He responded, [...] "There are three things that are certain in life: death, taxes, and Michelle is not running for president. That I can tell you."

2500|$|As a teenager, Eden Riegel nearly {{gave up on}} her {{pursuit of}} a {{successful}} acting career. She stated {{that she had seen}} a [...] "number of talented people" [...] who were struggling, and that she started to doubt whether <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> have the success that she wanted. She decided {{that it was time to}} major in social and political theory, go to law school, and become a lawyer. This changed while she attended Harvard. While there, she received [...] "a call from a casting director who thought that the five-foot-six beauty should audition to become Erica Kane’s daughter." [...] Later, the character would eventually be revealed to be a lesbian. Producers did not tell Riegel she would be portraying a lesbian until after she won the role. [...] "I was surprised," [...] she said.|$|E
2500|$|In 1948, {{her mother}} met a United States Air Force officer named Paul Beaulieu, from Quebec, Canada. The couple were married within a year. Beaulieu {{took over the}} raising of Priscilla, and was the only father <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> know. She took his surname {{and over the next}} few years she grew up quickly, helping to care for the growing family as her stepfather's Air Force career moved them from Connecticut to New Mexico to Maine. In her own words, she {{described}} herself during this period as [...] "a shy, pretty little girl unhappily accustomed to moving from base to base every two or three years". Priscilla later recalled that she felt uncomfortable moving so often because she never knew if she could make friends for life, or even if she would fit in with the new people she met on each move.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{claiming}} {{that she would}} never return to EastEnders in 1997, Lawrence was upset when she discovered that both Sid Owen and Mike Reid (Ricky and Frank) were leaving EastEnders in 2000 as, in her opinion, it ruled out any chance of her character returning to the show. She commented, [...] "It would be great fun to get all the Butcher clan back for a few months. I hear Diane's name mentioned quite a lot on the show — it makes me feel like I've never really left. But all the people I'm connected with are leaving, which makes going back harder and I'm really sorry about that. It would be great to have the Butcher clan come back for Mike's sendoff. But, sadly, I don't think there is the space for me to go back full-time." [...] In 2002, she was asked if <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> return to the soap and she responded, [...] "If they asked me, I’d love to go back. Not on a long term contract or anything because I love doing other things but I’d definitely like to go back." ...|$|E

It was announced on 15 July 2009 that she {{pulled out of the}} series due to private matters. This move hogged the news headlines once again, which was perceived to be a sudden disappearance and publicity stunt. Although the exact reason behind her pulling out of the series was never revealed, several colleagues hinted to the media that Xie had expressed discomfort in taking up this role before filming commenced. Eelyn Kok eventually replaced Xie in Together.|$|R

2500|$|The {{character}} was brought {{back for a}} period of four episodes. Lawrence has revealed that she thought she would have minimal involvement in the storyline and was surprised at how much dialogue she was given. Each of the returning characters were given their own storyline; in Diane's case, she was in a relationship with a female doctor named Suzanne. Lawrence commented, [...] "I think 's quite alright now—she's come back and she's sorted. She knows the score." [...] When asked if <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> make a full-time return, Lawrence said, [...] "Once you're re-established, you're a character that other characters can go and visit. For example, after Diane's left Walford again, Pat goes to stay with her for a couple of weeks. So there's no reason why I couldn't return for a two-week 'holiday' to see the kids!" [...] On 6 May 2012, a Daily Star reporter announced Lawrence would be returning to EastEnders alongside Sid Owen (Ricky Butcher) for the wedding of their on screen sister, Janine, played by Charlie Brooks. She made her on-screen return on 20 June 2012 and departed on 29 June.|$|E
