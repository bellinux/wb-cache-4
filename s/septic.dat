5|$|The prepatellar bursa and the {{olecranon}} bursa {{are the two}} bursae {{that are}} most likely to become infected, or <b>septic.</b> <b>Septic</b> bursitis typically occurs when the trauma to the knee causes an abrasion, though it is also possible for the infection to be caused by bacteria traveling through the blood from a pre-existing infection site. In approximately 80% of <b>septic</b> cases, the infection is caused by Staphylococcus aureus; other common infections are Streptococcus, Mycobacterium, and Brucella. It is highly unusual for <b>septic</b> bursitis to be caused by anaerobes, fungi, or Gram-negative bacteria. In very rare cases, the infection can be caused by tuberculosis.|$|E
5|$|Chemicals {{released}} by macrophages can also damage host tissue. TNF-α {{is an important}} chemical that is {{released by}} macrophages that causes the blood in small vessels to clot to prevent an infection from spreading. However, if a bacterial infection spreads to the blood, TNF-α is released into vital organs, which can cause vasodilation {{and a decrease in}} plasma volume; these in turn can be followed by <b>septic</b> shock. During <b>septic</b> shock, TNF-α release causes a blockage of the small vessels that supply blood to the vital organs, and the organs may fail. <b>Septic</b> shock can lead to death.|$|E
5|$|A {{definitive}} {{diagnosis of}} the condition can usually be made once a clinical history and physical examination have been obtained, though determining {{whether or not the}} bursitis is <b>septic</b> is not as straightforward. Treatment of prepatellar bursitis depends on the severity of the symptoms. Mild cases may only require rest and icing of the knee. A number of different treatment options have been used for severe <b>septic</b> cases, including intravenous antibiotics, surgical irrigation of the bursa, and bursectomy.|$|E
5|$|A {{physical}} examination and medical history {{are generally not}} enough to distinguish between infectious and non-infectious bursitis; aspiration of the bursal fluid is often required for this, along with a cell culture and Gram stain of the aspirated fluid. <b>Septic</b> prepatellar bursitis may be diagnosed if the fluid is {{found to have a}} neutrophil count above 1500 per microliter, a threshold significantly lower than that of <b>septic</b> arthritis (50,000 cells per microliter). A tuberculosis infection can be confirmed using a roentgenogram and urinalysis.|$|E
5|$|The Fishing Creek Sportsmans' Association has {{proposed}} a number of methods to conserve Fishing Creek and its tributaries. These include planting riparian buffers, eliminating leaky <b>septic</b> systems, and protecting the area from hydraulic fracturing.|$|E
5|$|The various nicknames {{associated}} with prepatellar bursitis {{arise from the}} fact that it commonly occurs among those individuals whose professions require frequent kneeling, such as carpenters, carpet layers, gardeners, housemaids, mechanics, miners, plumbers, and roofers. The exact incidence of the condition is not known; it is difficult to estimate because only severe <b>septic</b> cases require hospital admission, and mild non-septic cases generally go unreported. Prepatellar bursitis is more common among males than females. It affects all age groups, but is more likely to be <b>septic</b> when it occurs in children.|$|E
5|$|In December 1927 Keable {{contracted}} a worsened kidney infection, became <b>septic</b> and delirious, and, on 22 December, died at home. The New York Times obituary {{identified the}} illness that killed him as Bright's disease; {{the term was}} {{used to refer to}} a number of nephritic kidney conditions.|$|E
5|$|Electricity {{supply to}} Vedaranyam is {{regulated}} and {{distributed by the}} Nagapattinam circle of Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB). Water supply project through the Vedaranyam Municipality is approved by the Commissioner of Municipal Administration, Chennai. Water is obtained from hand pumps and fountains located {{in various parts of}} the town. Door to door collection of garbage is done by sanitary workers of the municipality and about 6 metric tonnes of solid waste are collected from the town every day. Vedaranyam municipality does not have underground drainage system and the current sewerage system for disposal of sullage is through <b>septic</b> tanks and public conveniences.|$|E
5|$|Electricity {{supply to}} the town is {{regulated}} and distributed by the Sirkazhi Circle of Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB). Water supply {{is provided by the}} Sirkazhi municipality from the Kollidam river; it is distributed through five water tanks which supply 2million (two million) litres a day. Push carts and tricycles are used to collect solid waste, which is deposited in marsh lands located outside the town. Sirkazhi municipality is implementing underground drainage and the current sewerage system is through <b>septic</b> tanks and public conveniences. Roadside drains carry away untreated sewage, which is released into the sea or accumulates in low-lying areas.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{examination}} findings typically include jaundice {{and right}} upper quadrant tenderness. Charcot's triad {{is a set}} of three common findings in cholangitis: abdominal pain, jaundice, and fever. This was assumed in the past to be present in 50–70% of cases, although more recently the frequency has been reported as 15–20%. Reynolds' pentad includes the findings of Charcot's triad with the presence of <b>septic</b> shock and mental confusion. This combination of symptoms indicates worsening of the condition and the development of sepsis, and is seen less commonly still.|$|E
5|$|Some {{stretches}} of Fishing Creek contain {{significant amounts of}} algae because of leaking <b>septic</b> systems in the watershed. The area around the tributary West Creek is the least habitable part of the Fishing Creek area, according to a 2011 study. The water quality of Fishing Creek can vary. Its pH ranges from 4.9 to 8.5, while the concentration of dissolved oxygen ranges from 5 to 17.5mg per liter. The creek's average discharge is 615 cubic feet per second (17.4 m3/s); its watershed contains gravel, shale and various loams—in particular the Albrights soil series and the Leck Kill soil.|$|E
5|$|The {{electricity}} supplied {{to the town}} is regulated and distributed by the Nagapattinam circle of Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB). The water supply {{is provided by the}} Nagapattinam Municipality, through borewells from Vettar river — the distribution is done through pumping stations located at Kurukathi, Andipalayam and Solomon Park. About 55 metric tonnes of solid waste are collected from the town every day. Nagapattinam municipality does not have an underground drainage system and the current sewerage system for disposal of sullage is through <b>septic</b> tanks and public conveniences. The storm water drainage system is made up of the natural river drainage and man-made storm water drains.|$|E
5|$|The larvae of Megaselia scalaris (Phoridae) {{are almost}} {{omnivorous}} and consume such substances as paint and shoe polish. The larvae of the shore flies (Ephydridae) and some Chironomidae survive in extreme environments including glaciers (Diamesa sp., Chironomidae), hot springs, geysers, saline pools, sulphur pools, <b>septic</b> tanks and even crude oil (Helaeomyia petrolei). Adult hoverflies (Syrphidae) {{are well known}} for their mimicry and the larvae adopt diverse lifestyles including being inquiline scavengers inside the nests of social insects. Some brachycerans are agricultural pests, some bite animals and humans and suck their blood, and some transmit diseases.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} differential diagnosis in gout is <b>septic</b> arthritis. This {{should be considered}} in those with signs of infection or those who do not improve with treatment. To help with diagnosis, a synovial fluid Gram stain and culture may be performed. Other conditions that can look similar include pseudogout, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and reactive arthritis. Gouty tophi, in particular when not located in a joint, can be mistaken for basal cell carcinoma or other neoplasms.|$|E
5|$|The {{town has}} an {{underground}} sewage system, covering about 40% {{of the town}} area, that collects domestic waste and conveys it to <b>septic</b> tanks for disposal. Solid waste is disposed of in a nearby dumping ground, which also houses the town's crematorium. Doorstep collection of garbage and segregation of biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste have been implemented since 2003. Vermicomposting of vegetable waste is carried out {{with the help of}} non-governmental organisations. In June 2009, in order to reduce waste, the municipality proposed a ban on plastic carrier bags and sachets in the town.|$|E
5|$|Electricity {{supply to}} the town is {{regulated}} and distributed by the Ramanathapuram circle of Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB). Water supply {{is provided by the}} Rameswaram Municipality – the head works is located at Nambunayaki Amman Kovil, Meyyambuli, Semmamadam & Natarajapuram and distributed through four over head tanks having a total capacity of 1430,000 litres. About 6 metric tonnes of solid waste are collected from the town every day in the four zones covering the whole of the town. Rameswaram does not have a sewerage system for disposal of sullage and the disposal system consists of <b>septic</b> tanks and public conveniences. Roadside drains carry untreated sewage out of the town to let out raw into the sea or accumulates in low-lying area.|$|E
5|$|Other {{groups in}} the British grindcore scene, such as Heresy and Unseen Terror, have {{emphasized}} the influence of American hardcore punk, including <b>Septic</b> Death, as well as Swedish D-beat. Sore Throat cites Discharge, Disorder, {{and a variety of}} European D-beat and thrash metal groups, including Hellhammer, and American hardcore groups, such as Poison Idea and D.R.I.. Japanese hardcore, particularly GISM, is also mentioned by a number of originators of the style. Other key groups cited by current and former members of Napalm Death as formative influences include Discharge, Amebix, Throbbing Gristle, and the aforementioned Dirty Rotten Imbeciles. Post-punk, such as Killing Joke and Joy Division, was also cited as an influence on early Napalm Death.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} at school, Flash tries to {{convince}} Squeezit to help him rescue René and Frenchy. When Squeezit refuses, Flash enlists the help of Gramps instead. In the Sixth Dimension, they speak to an old Jewish man who tells them how to help Frenchy escape, but they soon are captured by Bust Rod. Doris interrogates Flash and Gramps and then lowers them into a large <b>septic</b> tank. She then plots her revenge against Frenchy, relocating all the denizens of Cell 63 to a torture chamber. She leaves the Princess to oversee Frenchy's torture and execution, but when a fuse is blown, the torture is put on hold and the prisoners from Cell 63 are relocated to keep the King from finding them.|$|E
5|$|Water {{services}} used to {{be provided}} by the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System, which served 30% of the city with most other sewage being directly dumped into storm drains, <b>septic</b> tanks, or open canals. MWSS was privatized in 1997, which split the water concession into {{the east and west}} zones. The Maynilad Water Services took over the west zone of which Manila is a part. It now provides the supply and delivery of potable water and sewerage system in Manila, but it does not provide service to the southeastern part of the city which belongs to the east zone that is served by Manila Water. Electric services are provided by Meralco, the sole electric power distributor in Metro Manila.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, the {{comparison}} between UDDTs and <b>septic</b> tank-based sanitation systems is not as straightforward as {{the comparison}} with pit latrines as a <b>septic</b> system also treats greywater. However, the relatively high costs of <b>septic</b> systems, particularly mound-type <b>septic</b> systems can be partially mitigated or, if {{used in conjunction with}} an onsite greywater system, eliminated altogether by installing UDDTs in place of flush toilets.|$|E
25|$|<b>Septic</b> tanks {{have to be}} pumped {{periodically}} by {{a vacuum}} truck to eliminate non reducing solids. Failure to pump a <b>septic</b> tank can cause overflow that damages the leach field, and contaminates ground water. <b>Septic</b> tanks may also require some lifestyle changes, such as not using garbage disposals, minimizing fluids flushed into the tank, and minimizing nondigestible solids flushed into the tank. For example, <b>septic</b> safe toilet paper is recommended.|$|E
25|$|Costs of {{emptying}} <b>septic</b> tanks. The cost of emptying <b>septic</b> tanks can be significant. Some people {{avoid using}} their <b>septic</b> tanks, {{because if they}} do the tank fills up more quickly and they must pay to empty it more often. They thus continue to pollute the surrounding environment, although they have sanitation facilities at home.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{system is a}} tiled leach field combined with a <b>septic</b> tank. The basic idea {{is to provide a}} small system with primary sewage treatment. Sludge settles {{to the bottom of the}} <b>septic</b> tank, is partially reduced by anaerobic digestion, and fluid is dispersed in the leach field. The leach field is usually under a yard growing grass. <b>Septic</b> tanks can operate entirely by gravity, and if well managed, are reasonably safe.|$|E
25|$|During {{the last}} 40 years, {{a great deal}} of time and effort has been {{expended}} by both the government and the residents to ensure that Paudash Lake remains in as natural a state as possible and free of pollution. The installation of any <b>septic</b> tank system is carefully controlled by the building code and must be well removed from the lakeshore. Over the years, careful checks have been made to ensure against <b>septic</b> leakage into the lake, including dye tests in all <b>septic</b> facilities and tests for any <b>septic</b> bacteria around the entire shoreline. However, water quality problems from earlier area mining operations (i.e. Faraday and Dyno mines) are still adversely impacting water quality.|$|E
25|$|A project {{involving}} the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission (SOPAC) is constructing composting toilets {{and improving the}} treatment of sewage sludge from <b>septic</b> tanks on Fongafale in order to reduct the leakage from <b>septic</b> tanks into groundwater and the ocean and lagoon.|$|E
25|$|According to WAJ, only 65% of the {{population}} {{are connected to the}} sewerage system. The rest of those having access to improved sanitation uses on-site sanitation solutions such as <b>septic</b> tanks. These <b>septic</b> tanks, if not lined properly, may leak to the groundwater aquifers and contaminate them.|$|E
25|$|An {{ultrasound}} {{scan of the}} hip can easily demonstrate fluid inside the joint capsule (Fabella sign), although {{this is not always}} present in transient synovitis. However, it cannot reliably distinguish between <b>septic</b> arthritis and transient synovitis. If <b>septic</b> arthritis needs to be ruled out, needle aspiration of the fluid can be performed under ultrasound guidance. In transient synovitis, the joint fluid will be clear. In <b>septic</b> arthritis, there will be pus in the joint, which can be sent for bacterial culture and antibiotic sensitivity testing.|$|E
25|$|In the CORTICUS study, {{hydrocortisone}} hastened {{the reversal}} of <b>septic</b> shock, but did not influence mortality, with an increased occurrence of <b>septic</b> shock relapse and hypernatremia. The latter findings tempered enthusiasm for the broad use of hydrocortisone in <b>septic</b> shock. Prior to this study, several other smaller studies showed beneficial effects of long courses of low doses of corticoid. Several factors (such as lack of statistical power due to slow recruitment) could have led a false-negative finding on mortality in the CORTICUS study; thus, more research is needed.|$|E
25|$|Tuvalu {{is working}} with the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission (SOPAC) to {{implement}} composting toilets and to improve the treatment of sewage sludge from <b>septic</b> tanks on Fongafale as <b>septic</b> tanks are leaking into the freshwater lens in the sub-surface of the atoll as well as the ocean and lagoon. Composting toilets reduce water use by up to 30%.|$|E
25|$|Water {{and waste}} water: Each house must {{maintain}} its own water supply, most collecting rainwater in cisterns. Water delivery is available {{and tends to}} be very active during dry summers. Except for the Oneroa sewage district which discharges into the Owhanake Treatment plant, each residence and relevant commercial establishments must install a <b>septic</b> tank and <b>septic</b> field to handle sewage. This is a requirement in every building consent.|$|E
25|$|Water {{disposal}} {{is mostly}} done by draining in a <b>septic</b> tank where the sewage {{is not that}} well developed.|$|E
25|$|In many {{suburban}} {{and rural areas}} households are not connected to sewers, and they rather use on-site sewage facilities or decentralised treatment if they are connected to piped water and use flush toilets. They discharge their wastewater into <b>septic</b> tanks or other types of on-site sanitation systems (e.g. Sequencing batch reactors or constructed wetlands). On-site systems include drain fields, which require significant area of land. This makes <b>septic</b> systems unsuitable for most cities.|$|E
25|$|There is {{frequent}} flooding which impacts pit latrines and <b>septic</b> tank systems, {{resulting in}} inoperable toilet systems and water contamination.|$|E
25|$|Beaver Glen Campground on {{the east}} margins of the Waskesiu town site has {{electricity}} to half of its 213 sites (no water or <b>septic</b> hook-ups), washrooms with hot and cold water and showers, central <b>septic</b> tank service and drinking water. Sites can be booked in advance through the Parks Canada Campground Reservation Service through a toll free number or via online reservation. Details about how to reserve {{can be found at}} the Parks Canada website.|$|E
25|$|However, <b>septic</b> tanks remain {{popular because}} they permit {{standard}} plumbing fixtures, and require {{few or no}} lifestyle sacrifices.|$|E
25|$|Ouagadougou {{sanitation}} infrastructure. Most of {{the population}} of Ouagadougou uses latrines. Only about 5% use <b>septic</b> tanks and an even smaller proportion is connected to a 43km-sewer network completed in 2006 in the city center and that serves mainly commercial, industrial and institutional clients. The network discharges to a 20-ha stabilization pond in the Kossodo industrial area, which also treats sludge from <b>septic</b> tanks brought in by tankers.|$|E
