5|$|In 1946, {{when the}} Duchess {{was staying at}} Ednam Lodge, {{the home of the}} Earl of Dudley, some of her jewels were stolen. There were rumours that the theft had been masterminded by the royal family as an attempt to regain jewels taken from the Royal Collection by the Duke, or by the Windsors {{themselves}} as part of an insurance fraud—they made a large deposit of loose stones at Cartier the following year. However, in 1960, career criminal Richard Dunphie confessed to the crime. The <b>stolen</b> <b>pieces</b> were {{only a small portion of}} the Windsor jewels, which were either bought privately, inherited by the Duke, or given to the Duke when he was Prince of Wales.|$|E
500|$|Hartford, Connecticut gangster Robert [...] "Bobby the Cook" [...] Gentile {{has been}} {{suggested}} on multiple occasions as knowing {{the location of the}} Gardner works. In May 2012, FBI agents searched Gentile's home in Manchester, Connecticut. They did not find any stolen works, despite searching his preferred hiding spot beneath a false floor {{with the help of his}} son. However, in the basement, they found a sheet of paper listing what each stolen piece might draw on the black market. In January 2016, the FBI contrived gun charges against Gentile to force him to reveal the location of the missing works. During a hearing, a federal prosecutor revealed significant evidence tying Gentile to the crime. The prosecutor stated that Gentile and mob partner Robert Guarente attempted to use the return of two <b>stolen</b> <b>pieces</b> to reduce a prison sentence for one of their associates. Guarente's wife told investigators in early 2015 that her husband once had possession of some of the art, and gave two paintings to Gentile before Guarente died of cancer in 2004. Also, while in federal prison during 2013–2014, Gentile told at least three people he had knowledge of the stolen art. [...] In 2015, Gentile submitted to a lie detector test, denying advanced knowledge of the heist or ever possessing any paintings. The result showed a 0.1% chance that he was truthful. According to Gentile's lawyer, federal agents are convinced that Gentile has the stolen works. Gentile's home was searched again by the FBI on May 2, 2016, even though his lawyer insists that if Gentile had the stolen artwork or knowledge of its whereabouts, he would have turned it in for the reward money a long time ago. On September 5, 2017, Gentile was scheduled to be sentenced for a separate weapons charge in Connecticut.|$|E

[...] In April 2014, an agreement was reached whereby the collection confiscated in Munich was {{to be returned to}} Gurlitt in exchange for his co-operation with a government-led task force charged with returning <b>stolen</b> <b>pieces</b> to the rightful owners. However, Gurlitt died on 6 May 2014. His will bequeathed all his property to the Museum of Fine Arts Bern, Switzerland, after all legitimate claims of ownership against it had been evaluated.|$|E

2500|$|Vandalism {{and petty}} crime has long plagued Cherokee Park. Vandalism was {{reported}} {{as early as}} 1936. In the 1950s into the mid-1960s newspapers reported with amusement on the serial theft of elements of the Hogan's Fountain monument - especially a bronze turtle - with headlines such as [...] "Cherokee Park Turtle on the Loose Again" [...] and [...] "Bronze Turtle Steps Lively - Flees Cherokee Park Nest". According to a park commissioner, after the vandals saw the stories in print, they would always deposit the <b>stolen</b> <b>pieces,</b> which weighed about 100 pounds, somewhere in the park. Eventually they were all bolted down from beneath such that vandals were unable to remove them. More seriously, the Daniel Boone statue at the park's Eastern Parkway entrance was toppled on May 21, 1962, causing severe damage to it. Park officials claimed police had seen but not arrested a crowd of youths drinking openly near the statue earlier in the day, police denied the charge.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{reported}} that the National Museum of Iraq was among the looted sites. The FBI was soon called into Iraq {{to track down the}} stolen items. It was found that the initial allegations of looting of substantial portions of the collection were heavily exaggerated. Initial reports asserted a near-total looting of the museum, estimated at upwards of 170,000 inventory lots, or about 501,000 pieces. The more recent estimate places the number of <b>stolen</b> <b>pieces</b> at around 15,000, and about 10,000 of them probably were taken in an [...] "inside job" [...] before U.S. troops arrived, according to Bogdanos. Over 5,000 looted items have since been recovered. An assertion that U.S. forces did not guard the museum because they were guarding the Ministry of Oil and Ministry of Interior is disputed by investigator Colonel Matthew Bogdanos in his 2005 book Thieves of Baghdad. Bogdanos notes that the Ministry of Oil building was bombed, but the museum complex, which took some fire, was not bombed. He also writes that Saddam Hussein's troops set up sniper's nests inside and on top of the museum, and nevertheless U.S. Marines and soldiers stayed close enough to prevent wholesale looting.|$|E
6000|$|We {{could give}} {{some of the}} <b>stolen</b> <b>Pieces,</b> too; but they are of abstruse tenor, and would be mere enigmas to readers here. Enough that Friedrich understands them. To Friedrich's intense and long-continued scrutiny, they indicate, what is next to incredible, but is at length fatally undeniable, That the old TREATY, which we called OF WARSAW, [...] "Treaty for Partitioning Prussia," [...] is still (in spite of all {{subsequent}} and superincumbent Treaties to the contrary) vigorously alive underground; that Saxon Bruhl and her Hungarian Majesty, to whom is now added Czarish Majesty, are fixed as ever on cutting down this afflictive, too aspiring King of Prussia {{to the size of}} a Brandenburg Elector; busy (in these Menzel Documents) considering how it may be done, especially how the bear-skin may be SHARED;--and that, in short, there lies ahead, inevitable seemingly, and not far off, a Third Silesian War.|$|E

50|$|Players must {{complete}} five {{levels to}} finish the game. The levels themselves are identical to the ones featured in an earlier game, Gizmos & Gadgets!. Each level involves going through a warehouse, solving puzzles to open doors, and collecting pieces that must be used to win a checkers-like strategy game {{at the end of}} the level. While exploring the warehouse, the player must avoid having their <b>pieces</b> <b>stolen</b> by the Metal Minions. A magnet can be thrown to trap a Metal Minion and reclaim a <b>stolen</b> <b>piece</b> - the magnets themselves can be used an infinite number of times. After beating Morty at all five levels, a puzzle is put together portraying him leaving the factory. Along the way, the player is helped by Rusty, a Metal Minion who didn't like what Morty was doing.|$|R

6000|$|The {{question}} thus arises, Is {{there any}} truth whatever in these world-wide and world-old stories of inanimate objects acting like animated things? Has fetishism {{one of its}} origins in the actual field of supernormal experience in the X region? This question we do not propose to answer, as the evidence, though practically universal, {{may be said to}} rest on imposture and illusion. But we can, at least, give a sketch {{of the nature of the}} evidence, beginning with that as to the apparently voluntary movements of objects, not untouched. Mr. Tylor quotes from John Bell's 'Journey in Asia' (1719) an account of a Mongol Lama who wished to discover certain <b>stolen</b> <b>pieces</b> of damask. His method was to sit on a bench, when 'he carried it, or, as was commonly believed, it carried him, to the very tent' of the thief. Here the bench is innocently believed to be self-moving. Again, Mr. Rowley tells how in Manganjah the sorcerer, to find out a criminal, placed, with magical ceremonies, two staffs of wood in the hands of some young men. 'The sticks whirled and dragged the men round like mad,' and finally escaped and rolled to the feet of the wife of a chief, who was then denounced as the guilty person.[2] ...|$|E

His vast and priceless collection of art works were soon auctioned off and dispersed to art dealers around the world. Eventually many pieces found their way to Japan in the hands of various private deals (many with criminal ties). In subsequent years, the collection were <b>stolen</b> <b>piece</b> by piece, regardless of heavy security, by a trio of thieves calling themselves [...] "Cat's Eye", who were actually Heinz's grown-up daughters seeking clues to his whereabouts and hoping to get his attention {{to get him out of}} hiding.|$|R
