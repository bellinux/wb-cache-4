25|$|The Eastern Desert has a quite {{different}} range of fauna and has {{much in common with}} the Sinai Peninsula, showing the importance of the broad Nile in separating the two desert regions. Here are found the striped hyena, Nubian ibex, bushy-tailed jird, golden spiny mouse, Blanford's fox and Rüppell's fox. The sand partridge, <b>streaked</b> <b>scrub</b> <b>warbler,</b> mourning wheatear and white-crowned wheatear are typical of this region. The high rocky mountains of Gebel Elba in the south have a distinctive range of animals including the aardwolf, striped polecat, and common genet, and there may still be African wild ass in this area.|$|E

50|$|The Barratt's <b>warbler</b> or African <b>scrub</b> <b>warbler</b> (Bradypterus barratti), is {{a species}} of Old World warbler in the family Locustellidae. It is found in eastern South Africa, Lesotho, eastern Zimbabwe and {{adjacent}} western Mozambique. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist montane forests.|$|R
50|$|The Victorin's warbler (Cryptillas victorini), or Victorin's <b>scrub</b> <b>warbler</b> is {{a species}} of African warbler, {{formerly}} placed in the Sylviidae family. It is not {{closely related to the}} genus Bradypterus, where it was placed for many years, but instead is placed in a monotypic genus Cryptillas.|$|R
50|$|The <b>streaked</b> <b>scrub</b> <b>warbler</b> is a bird of open desert with a sparse {{cover of}} scrub, {{especially}} wadi beds with a denser cover than the surrounding desert, {{as well as}} scree areas with bushes in ravines and gorges.|$|E
50|$|The <b>streaked</b> <b>scrub</b> <b>warbler</b> (Scotocerca inquieta) is {{a species}} of bird in the Scotocercidae family from Africa and {{south-western}} Asia. It is a bird of desert fringes, frequenting scrubby areas, ravines and gorges, and is mainly resident, although local movements can occur outside the breeding season.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>streaked</b> <b>scrub</b> <b>warbler</b> has a {{very wide}} range and is scarce in some places and common in others. No {{particular}} threats have been identified and the population {{is believed to be}} steady or declining slightly. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of [...] "least concern".|$|E
50|$|The Knysna <b>warbler</b> or Knysna <b>scrub</b> <b>warbler</b> (Bradypterus sylvaticus) is a {{very shy}} and cryptic warbler, endemic to the coastal regions of South Africa. Its {{population}} is small and probably declining, due to natural and artificial fragmentation of its habitat, and limited dispersal and reproductive ability.|$|R

50|$|Lobéké National Park is an Important Bird Area (#CM033). Over {{three hundred}} {{species of birds}} have been {{recorded}} here. The rare red-nosed green pigeon (Treron calvus), rhinoceros birds (Buceros rhinoceros), Chrysococcyx flavigularis, Otus icterorhynchus and the chestnut kingfisher (Halcyon badia) can all {{be found in the}} park. Specifically within Cameroon and Gabon, it is an important bird area for the Ja River <b>scrub</b> <b>warbler.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>{{streaked}}</b> <b>scrub</b> <b>warbler</b> is a small, skulking {{desert warbler}} which cocks its tail over its back. The adults are grey brown above, finely streaked with dark brown. They {{have a broad}} pale supercilium and a thin black eyestripe. The underparts are whitish with reddish flanks and vent, the breast is finely streaked. The tail is graduated and dark brown with a white tip. Juveniles are duller.|$|E

5000|$|Cretzschmar was {{the founder}} and second {{director}} of the Senckenberg Natural History Society in 1817. One of the founding {{members of the society}} was Eduard Rüppell, and the two men collaborated in publishing the results of Rüppell's explorations in Africa. The Atlas zu der reise im nördlichen Afrika ("Atlas of Rüppell's Travels in Northern Africa"; 1826-28) [...] included an ornithological section by Cretzschmar describing around thirty new species, including Meyer's parrot, Nubian bustard, Goliath heron, <b>streaked</b> <b>scrub</b> <b>warbler</b> and Cretzschmar's bunting. In the field of mammalogy, he is the binomial author of the scimitar-horned oryx and Soemmerring's gazelle.|$|E
50|$|The rich tugay {{vegetation}} provides favourable habitats for birdlife. The {{site was}} classified as an IBA because it supports significant numbers of the populations of various bird species, either as residents, or as breeding or passage migrants. These include saker falcons, pale-backed pigeons, Egyptian nightjars, European rollers, white-winged woodpeckers, great tits, <b>streaked</b> <b>scrub</b> warblers, Sykes's warblers and red-headed buntings.|$|R
25|$|The diet of wildcats in Great Britain varies geographically; {{in eastern}} Scotland, {{lagomorphs}} make up 70% of their diet, {{while in the}} west, 47% consists of small rodents. In Western Europe, the wildcat feeds on hamsters, brown rats, dormice, water voles, voles, and wood mice. From time to time, small carnivores (martens, polecats, stoats, and weasels) are preyed upon, {{as well as the}} fawns of red deer, roe deer, and chamois. In the Carpathians, the wildcat feeds primarily on yellow-necked mice, red-backed voles, and ground voles. European hares are also taken on occasion. In Transcarpathia, the wildcat's diet consists of mouse-like rodents, galliform birds, and squirrels. Wildcats in the Dnestr swamps feed on small voles, water voles, and birds, while those living in the Prut swamps primarily target water voles, brown rats, and muskrats. Birds taken by Prut wildcats include warblers, ferruginous ducks, coots, spotted crakes, and gadwalls. In Moldavia, the wildcat's winter diet consists primarily of rodents, while birds, fish, and crayfish are eaten in summer. Brown rats and water voles, as well as muskrats and waterfowl are the main sources of food for wildcats in the Kuban delta. Wildcats in the northern Caucasus feed on mouse-like rodents and edible dormice, as well as birds on rare occasions. On rare occasions, young chamois and roe deer, are also attacked. Wildcats on the Black Sea coast are thought to feed on small birds, shrews, and hares. On one occasion, the feathers of a white-tailed eagle and the skull of a kid were found at a den site. In Transcaucasia, the wildcat's diet consists of gerbils, voles, birds, and reptiles in the summer, and birds, mouse-like rodents, and hares in winter. Turkmenian wildcats feed on great and red-tailed gerbils, Afghan voles, thin-toed ground squirrels, Tolai hares, small birds (particularly larks), lizards, beetles, and grasshoppers. Near Repetek, the wildcat is responsible for destroying over 50% of nests made by desert finches, <b>streaked</b> <b>scrub</b> warblers, red-tailed warblers, and turtledoves. In the Qarshi steppes of Uzbekistan, the wildcat's prey, in descending order of preference, includes great and red-tailed gerbils, jerboas, other rodents and passerine birds, reptiles, and insects. Wilcats in eastern Kyzyl Kum have similar prey preferences, with the addition of tolai hares, midday gerbils, five-toed jerboas, and steppe agamas. In Kyrgyzstan, the wildcat's primary prey varies from tolai hares near Issyk Kul, pheasants in the Chu and Talas valleys, and mouse-like rodents and gray partridges in the foothills. In Kazakhstan's lower Ili, the wildcat mainly targets rodents, muskrats, and Tamarisk gerbils. Occasionally, remains of young roe deer and wild boar are present in its faeces. After rodents, birds follow in importanance, along with reptiles, fish, insects, eggs, grass stalks and nuts (which probably enter the cat's stomach through pheasant crops). In west Africa, the wildcat feeds on rats, mice, gerbils, hares, small to medium-sized birds (up to francolins), and lizards. In southern Africa, where wildcats attain greater sizes than their western counterparts, antelope fawns and domestic stock, such as lambs and kids are occasionally targeted.|$|R
50|$|The <b>streaked</b> <b>scrub</b> <b>warbler</b> nests in low scrub up to 1.5m {{above the}} ground, the nest is a domed {{structure}} made {{of grass and}} twigs and lined with feathers, fur and plant down. It has 1-2 side entrances, {{if there is a}} second it is used only as an exit. The clutch size averages 3-5 but varies from 2-5, incubation is roughly two weeks with another two weeks before the young fledge. Its main food is insects but it will also eat seeds which may be very important in winter. It forages on the ground, fossicking through leaf litter and other debris under bushes, and into cavities but will also feed up in the vegetation at times.|$|E
