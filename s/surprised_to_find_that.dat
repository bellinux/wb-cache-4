After they have sex, he breaks off their relationship through a letter. He then drops out of university and becomes involved with the nascent nationalist movement, following future-president Sukarno; these acts cause his family to disown him. He later comes to Batavia to search for Tono and is <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> Tini has married the doctor. Hartono asks her to run away with him, but she refuses. He then goes to Surabaya.|$|E
5|$|According to phylogenetic {{analyses}} {{based on}} the sequences of both the S and M segments, OROV is most {{closely related to the}} clade formed by BAYV, CATV, BCCV, and Muleshoe virus (MUL; from the hispid cotton rat). In 2009, Piet Maes and colleagues proposed that the closely related BAYV, BCCV, and MUL be united into a single species. Chu and colleagues were <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> the same species, Oryzomys couesi, harbored different viruses (OROV and CATV), though noted that the subspecies infected by the two viruses were different. In 2010, Delton Hanson and colleagues suggested on the basis of various lines of evidence, including the presence of different hantaviruses, that western Mexican populations of Oryzomys couesi represent a different species, Oryzomys mexicanus.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1943 the District Engineer of the Manhattan Engineer District, Lt-Col Kenneth Nichols {{had several}} queries from Canada {{relating}} to contracts Canadian firms Eldorado Gold Mines and Consolidated Mining and Smelting (CMS of Cominco) {{had for the}} secret atomic bomb project; CMS was building a heavy water plant and Eldorado was mining and processing uranium ore. He phoned a C. D. Howe in Ottawa and arranged to travel on the overnight train to Ottawa and see Howe the next day (June 14). On arriving at the address given Nichols was <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> Howe was the minister of munitions and supply, and found him most friendly. Howe was told about the Manhattan Project, and Nichols was told that Eldorado was now a Crown company.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) is visited by her ex-boyfriend, Dennis Duffy (Dean Winters), who informs {{her that he}} is a sex addict, now atoning for his past errors. Liz is unimpressed and asks Dennis to leave, before going to work. Later, after {{arriving}} at work, Liz answers Jenna Maroney's (Jane Krakowski) cellphone, and is <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> Dennis is calling Jenna. Liz pretends to be Jenna and discovers that Jenna and Dennis slept together. Liz is determined not to let this revelation affect her friendship with Jenna, so the two go to confront Dennis about his behavior. During the confrontation, Liz discovers that Jenna and Dennis actually slept together in her bed, leading her to resent Jenna's actions. As a result, she fails to tell Jenna about an improperly attached piece of equipment, leading Jenna to injure her leg.|$|E
5|$|During their 15-day {{rest periods}} the company's men congregated around the Belgian-owned Elizabeth Hotel, in {{the centre of}} the city at the corner of Causeway and Manica Road. Many of them became seriously disaffected when they first {{received}} their salary from the Rhodesian Army. Having apparently been misled about wages of up to R$1,000 per month (₣7,000) by the French recruiters, they were <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> their basic monthly pay was actually R$245 (₣1,800), the same as a regular Rhodesian soldier. Moreover, some were upset that they had been paid in Rhodesian dollars, which because of the country's international isolation could not easily be exchanged for foreign currencies. Although it was not as much as they had been expecting, one disenchanted veteran of the unit afterwards admitted that the tax-exempt R$245 wage, which came with a $10 special-unit supplement, was still more than enough money for them to live comfortably in Salisbury during their time off.|$|E
5|$|The Grameen Bank {{encourages}} {{its members}} to create a positive impact by becoming {{actively involved in the}} politics of their country. According to Muhammad Yunus's book, Banker to the Poor, Yunus commissioned his bank staff to encourage Grameen borrowers to vote; however, the staff were not to influence the voters' decisions on which political party to support. While all Grameen groups are required to exhibit a form of democracy (such as electing a chairperson and secretary), the Grameen staff were <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> borrowers were thrilled with the opportunity to display their voting rights as citizens of Bangladesh in the 1991 national election. The work of the Grameen staff initiated a sharp increase in political activity which continued into the 1992, 1996, and 1997 elections. Since the Grameen Bank caters to women, the 1996 elections received more women voting than men, which led to the removal of political parties opposing women's rights. Not only did more women participate in political activism, but over 1,750 Grameen members, 268 male and 1,485 female, were elected to local offices in 1997.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{his many}} occupations and duties, Dimitrescu {{found time to}} compose orchestral and operatic works as well as chamber music. In fact, it was his great love of chamber music which led him to found Bucharest's first {{permanent}} string quartet. He served as its cellist for many years. Thus {{it comes as no}} <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> throughout his long musical life, Dimitrescu composed string quartets, seven in all.|$|R

5|$|Rose and Pete {{drive to}} the wedding together, and the car that had been meant to kill Pete appears and nearly collides with their car. They join the other guests, {{including}} Jackie who has brought the infant Rose with her. Rose is <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> Jackie and Pete argue frequently. A young Mickey runs in to warn the guests about the Reapers, who {{think it is a}} joke until a Reaper appears above and attacks them. The Doctor runs to the church and directs everyone inside, noting that the age of the church will protect them against the Reapers. The Doctor explains to Rose that her actions have caused a paradox that normally the Time Lords would have prevented. Without them, the Reapers are sterilising the wound in time by consuming everyone within it. The Doctor further warns Rose not to touch her infant self, as it could cause further damage to time and allow the Reapers into the church. Feeling that his TARDIS key is still warm, the Doctor sets it {{up in the middle of}} the church and the TARDIS slowly begins materialising around it.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{opens with}} Hilary Robinson (Anne Scott-Pendlebury) {{bringing}} breakfast to newlyweds Paul (Stefan Dennis) and Gail Robinson (Fiona Corke). She is <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> they {{have spent the}} night in separate bedrooms. To hide the fact that they only married for business purposes, Gail tells Hilary that she and Paul had an argument the night before. Hilary tells them to sort things out and she tends to the bouquets. At the Robinson house, Scott (Jason Donovan) begins to panic about getting married, while his father, Jim (Alan Dale), and best friend, Mike Young (Guy Pearce), set up tables for the reception. Meanwhile, Lucy Robinson (Sasha Close) tries to find her pet mice. Over at the Ramsay house, Scott's fiancée, Charlene (Kylie Minogue), is getting ready. Her mother, Madge (Anne Charleston), asks her brother Henry (Craig McLachlan) not to race up the altar. Hilary brings in the wedding bouquet, while Charlene's friend and bridesmaid, Jane (Annie Jones) arrives. After receiving a blue garter from her grandmother, Charlene becomes excited about the wedding. Scott arrives at the church with Mike, Paul and Jim. He is greeted by his old school friends and Mike explains that he and Jane arranged for them to attend {{to make up for the}} absence of Charlene's extended family.|$|E

In fact, Campese was touching down for a try. As Ryan loomed, Campese had stolen in, stolen away the ball and simply sprinted off in glorious isolation down the left hand touchline while the England B attack continued without the ball.|$|R
50|$|Burial {{societies}} are invariably intended for poorer and less educated people. Burial societiescan {{be seen as}} the product of urban living and appear to have evolved in order to aid migrantsfrom the rural areas who find themselves facing problems in a strange and hostile environment.In South Africa, the disadvantaged, and the poorer and less educated classes, have historicallybeen black and coloured people. The burial societies help alleviate the expenses incurred whenburying a loved one. It therefore comes as no <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> burial societies tend to bemore popular in these communities.|$|R

25|$|Shortly after King William's War had ended, Iberville sailed from Brest, France, {{with orders}} to {{establish}} a fort {{at the mouth of}} the Mississippi River. Accompanying Iberville on the voyage were Bienville, soldiers, and 200 colonists (including four women and children). The Le Moyne brothers arrived in Pensacola Bay on January 27, 1699, and were <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> Spaniards from Vera Cruz had arrived three months earlier.|$|E
25|$|G.M.B. Dobson (Exploring the Atmosphere, 2nd Edition, Oxford, 1968) {{mentioned}} that when springtime ozone {{levels in the}} Antarctic over Halley Bay were first measured in 1956, he was <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> they were ~320 DU, or about 150 DU below spring Arctic levels of ~450 DU. These were {{at that time the}} only known Antarctic ozone values available. What Dobson describes is essentially the baseline from which the ozone hole is measured: actual ozone hole values are in the 150–100 DU range.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, Berkley Books {{published}} The Illustrated Dune, an {{edition of}} Dune with 33 black-and-white sketch drawings and 8 full color paintings by John Schoenherr, {{who had done}} the cover art for the first printing of Dune and had illustrated the Analog serializations of Dune and Children of Dune. Herbert wrote in 1980 that though he had not spoken to Schoenherr prior to the artist creating the paintings, the author was <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> the artwork appeared exactly as he had imagined its fictional subjects, including sandworms, Baron Harkonnen and the Sardaukar.|$|E

25|$|Buckland Windmill {{was built}} by William Cooper, the Henfield millwright, {{sometime}} in the 1860s or 1870s. It stands in the grounds of a house that was lived in by the carpenters of the Buckland Court Estate. The windmill was discovered in 1995, with a mature yew tree standing very close to it. When the owners contacted the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings for advice, they were <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> it existed, because the mill had been missed by Ken Farries and Martin Mason, and omitted from their comprehensive work on windmills in the county.|$|E
25|$|The main Bulgarian {{advantage}} {{was their}} strong patriotic spirit and high morale, {{as well as}} the feeling among the men that they were fighting for a just cause. The same could not be said about the Serbs. Their king had misled them in his manifesto to the army, telling the Serbian soldiers that they were being sent to help the Bulgarians in their war against Turkey, and the Serbian soldiers were initially <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> they were fighting Bulgarians instead. Presumably, lying to his army was King Milan's only means to mobilise and command his troops without experiencing disobedience and unrest.|$|E
25|$|November 24 was dark, {{with low}} clouds, fog, and drizzling rain. Sherman's force crossed the Tennessee River {{successfully}} in the morning then took the set of hills {{at the north end}} of Missionary Ridge, although he was <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> a valley separated him from the main part of the ridge. Alerted by Grigsby's cavalry that the enemy had crossed the river in force, Bragg sent Cleburne's division and Wright's brigade to challenge Sherman. After skirmishing with the Confederates, Sherman ordered his men to dig in on the hills he had seized. Cleburne, likewise, dug in around Tunnel Hill.|$|E

30|$|The model {{does not}} have factors such as {{borrowing}} constraints, directed search, and ex ante heterogeneity of agents. 7 It is not a <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> the model does not match the data in all cases. Moreover, part of the effects in the data may refer to a transitional period. To approximate the steady states, we follow the usual procedure of taking the average of a long period {{before and after the}} reform (see Van den Berg (1990) for an analysis of nonstationary job search models). In particular, for the period after, we take the average of more than 3 years after the reform.|$|R
25|$|At {{first there}} was some {{question}} as to what exactly the new company should do. It did not seem {{that there would be}} any way for them to afford to develop a new computer, given that the now-large CDC had been unable to support more than one. When the President in charge of financing traveled to Wall Street to look for seed capital, he was <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> Cray's reputation was very well known. Far from struggling for some role to play in the market, the financial world was more than willing to provide Cray with all the money they would need to develop a new machine.|$|E
25|$|Lee was <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> the Federal {{army was}} moving {{as quickly as}} it was. As they crossed the Potomac and entered Frederick, Maryland, the Confederates were spread out over a {{considerable}} distance in Pennsylvania, with Richard Ewell across the Susquehanna River from Harrisburg and James Longstreet and A. P. Hill behind the mountains in Chambersburg. His cavalry, under Jeb Stuart, was engaged in a wide-ranging raid around the eastern flank of the Union army and was uncharacteristically out of touch with headquarters, leaving Lee blind as to his enemy's position and intentions. Lee realized that, just as in the Maryland Campaign, he had to concentrate his army before it could be defeated in detail. He ordered all units to move to the general vicinity of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.|$|E
25|$|Through their friendship, Burke {{discovered}} that Crabbe was {{more suited to}} be a clergyman than a surgeon. Crabbe had a good knowledge of Latin and an evident natural piety, and was well read in the scriptures. He was ordained to the curacy of his native town on 21 December 1781 through Burke's recommendation. He returned to live in Aldeburgh with his sister and father, his mother having died in his absence. Crabbe was <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> he was poorly treated by his fellow townsmen, who resented his rise in social class. With Burke's help, Crabbe was able to leave Aldeburgh to become chaplain to the Duke of Rutland at Belvoir Castle in Leicestershire. This was an unusual move on Burke's part, as this kind of preferment would usually {{have been given to}} a family member or personal friend of the Duke or through political interest.|$|E
