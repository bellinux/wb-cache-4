Controllable network devices represent the effective means of improving the system stability, and their deployment allows better use of the existing transmission facilities and can help to avoid construction of new lines. This dissertation addresses system analysis and modeling of controllable network devices. Transient angle stability {{is one of the}} major requirements limiting transfer capability of the power transmission systems. The theoretical concepts of transient angle controllability using controllable network devices are considered in this dissertation. The main results are derived for a general transmission network structure and applied to series and shunt compensators as well as braking resistors. The proposed approach allows to quantify controllability and to relate it to the control device size, type and location in the transmission network. Transient stability controllers are needed to maximize the device effect on the transient angle stability enhancement. The transient stability controller functional structure is discussed and the design requirements for each component are specified. The examples of controller designs are presented. Emerging technologies such as Thyristor-Controlled Series Compensators and <b>Synchronous</b> <b>Voltage</b> Sources offer superior control capabilities and performance characteristics as compared to conventional compensators.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the schematic and basic controls of a reconfigurable FACTS {{system that can}} be used to realize the major voltage source converter FACTS topologies: STATCOM, SSSC and UPFC. Furthermore, the state models and control algorithms for the FACTS devices are proposed. A Digital Signal Processor (DSP) is used to implement the control system for these devices. The comparison of the experimental and simulation results is also provided to verify the proposed controls and also it describes an active approach to series line compensation, in which a <b>synchronous</b> <b>voltage</b> source, implemented by a gate turn-off(GTO) based voltage sourced inverter, is used to provide controllable series compensation. This compensator, called static synchronous series compensator(SSSC),can provide controllable compensating voltage over an identical capacitive and inductive range, independently of the magnatude of the line current. It is immune to classical network resonances. In addition to series reactive compensation, with an external DC power supply it can also compensate the voltage drop across the resistive component of the line impedence. The compensation of the real part of the impedence can maintain high X/R ratio even if the line has a very high degree of series compensation. Concurrent and coordinated modulation of reactive and real compensation can greatly increase power oscillation damping. The paper discusses the basic operating and performance characteristics of the SSSC, and compares them to those characterizing and more conventional compensators based on thyristor-switched or controlled series capacitors. It also presents some of the results of TNA simulations carried out with an SSSC hardware model. presented an in-depth investigation of the dynamic performance of STATCOM and SSSC theoretically and by exact digital simulation.

40|$|Ultra {{low power}} {{wireless}} sensors and sensor systems are of increasing {{interest in a}} variety of applications ranging from structural health monitoring to industrial process control. Electrochemical batteries have thus far remained the primary energy sources for such systems despite the finite associated lifetimes imposed due to limitations associated with energy density. However, certain applications (such as implantable biomedical electronic devices and tire pressure sensors) require the operation of sensors and sensor systems over significant periods of time, where battery usage may be impractical and add cost due to the requirement for periodic re-charging and/or replacement. In order to address this challenge and extend the operational lifetime of wireless sensors, there has been an emerging research interest on harvesting ambient vibration energy. Vibration energy harvesting is a technology that generates electrical energy from ambient kinetic energy. Despite numerous research publications in this field over the past decade, low power density and variable ambient conditions remain as the key limitations of vibration energy harvesting. In terms of the piezoelectric transducers, the open-circuit voltage is usually low, which limits its power while extracted by a full-bridge rectifier. In terms of the interface circuits, most reported circuits are limited by the power efficiency, suitability to real-world vibration conditions and system volume due to large off-chip components required. The research reported in this thesis is focused on increasing power output of piezoelectric transducers and power extraction efficiency of interface circuits. There are five main chapters describing two new design topologies of piezoelectric transducers and three novel active interface circuits implemented with CMOS technology. In order to improve the power output of a piezoelectric transducer, a series connection configuration scheme is proposed, which splits the electrode of a harvester into multiple equal regions connected in series to inherently increase the open-circuit voltage generated by the harvester. This topology passively increases the rectified power while using a full-bridge rectifier. While most of piezoelectric transducers are designed with piezoelectric layers fully covered by electrodes, this thesis proposes a new electrode design topology, which maximizes the raw AC output power of a piezoelectric harvester by finding an optimal electrode coverage. In order to extract power from a piezoelectric harvester, three active interface circuits are proposed in this thesis. The first one improves the conventional SSHI (synchronized switch harvesting on inductor) by employing a startup circuitry to enable the system to start operating under much lower vibration excitation levels. The second one dynamically configures the connection of the two regions of a piezoelectric transducer to increase the operational range and output power under a variety of excitation levels. The third one is a novel SSH architecture which employs capacitors instead of inductors to perform <b>synchronous</b> <b>voltage</b> flip. This new architecture is named as SSHC (synchronized switch harvesting on capacitors) to distinguish from SSHI rectifiers and indicate its inductorless architecture...|$|E

40|$|As {{electric}} utilities move into more competitive generation supply regimes, with limited scope to expand transmission facilities, the optimisation of existing transmission corridors for power transfer becomes of paramount importance. In this scenario, Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) technology, which aims at increasing system operation flexibility, appear as an attractive alternative. Many {{of the ideas}} upon which the foundations of FACTS rest were conceived some time ago. Nevertheless, FACTS as a single coherent integrated philosophy is a newly developed concept in electrical power systems which has received {{the backing of the}} major manufacturers of electrical equipment and utilities around the world. It is looking at ways of capitalising on the new developments taking place in the area of high-voltage and highcurrent power electronics in order to increase the control of the power flows in the high voltage side of the network during both steady state and transient conditions, so as to make the network electronically controllable. In order to examine the applicability and functional specifications of FACTS devices, it is necessary to develop accurate and flexible digital models of these controllers and to upgrade most of the software tools used by planners and operators of electric power systems. The aim of this work is to develop general steady-state models FACTS devices, suitable for the analysis of positive sequence power flows in, large-scale real life electric power systems. Generalised nodal admittance models are developed for the Advance Series Compensator (ASC), Phase Shifter (PS), Static Var Compensator (SVC), Load Tap Changer (LTC) and Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC). In the case of the ASC, two models are presented, the Variable Series Compensator (VSC) and the Thyristor Controlled Series CapacitorFiring Angle (TCSC-F A). An alternative UPFC model based on the concept of <b>Synchronous</b> <b>Voltage</b> Source (SVS) is also developed. The Interphase Power Controller (IPC) is modelled by combining PSs and VSCs nodal admittance models. The combined solution of the power flow equations pertaining to the FACTS devices models and the power network is described in this thesis. The set of non-linear equations is solved through a Newton-Rapshon technique. In this unified iterative environment, the FACTS device state variables are adjusted automatically together with the nodal network state variables so as to satisfy a specified nodal voltage magnitudes and specified power flows. Guidelines and methods for implementing FACTS devices and their adjustments within the Newton-Rapshon algorithm are described. It is shown that large increments in the adjustments of FACTS devices and nodal network state variables during the backward substitution may dent the algorithm's quadratic convergence. Suitable strategies are given which avoid large changes in these variables and retain the Newton-RapshRapshon method's quadratic convergence. The influence of initial conditions of FACTS devices state variables on the iterative process is investigated. Suitable initialisation guidelines are recommended.
