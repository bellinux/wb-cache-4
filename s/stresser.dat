40|$|Abstract. Monoidal t-norm logic MTL {{and related}} fuzzy logics are {{extended}} with various modalities distinguished by the axiom �(A ∨ B) → (�A ∨ �B). Such modalities include Linear logic-like exponentials, the globalization (or Delta) operator, and truth <b>stressers</b> like “very true”. Extensions of MTL with modalities are presented here via axiomatizations, hypersequent calculi, and algebraic semantics, {{and related to}} standard algebras based on t-norms. Embeddings of logics, decidability, and the finite embedding property are also investigated. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We extend propositional Gödel logic by a unary modal operator, {{which we}} {{interpret}} as Gödel homomorphisms, i. e. functions [0, 1] → [0, 1] that distribute over the {{interpretations of the}} binary connectives of Gödel logic. We show that validity in the propositional fragment has a simple superintuitionistic Hilbert-type proof system, which is not structurally complete, and that validity does not change if we use the function class of continuous, strictly increasing functions. We also give proof systems for restrictions to sub- and superdiagonal functions. 11 Keywords: Gödel logic; superintuitionistic logic; modal logic; truth <b>stressers...</b>|$|R
40|$|Discussed is Static Rotor Testing of the SR- 7 L Large Scale Advanced Prop-Fan (LAP). The LAP is an {{advanced}} 9 foot diameter, 8 bladed propeller {{designed and built}} by Hamilton Standard under contract to the NASA Lewis Research Center. The Prop-Fan employs thin swept blades to provide efficient propulsion at flight speeds up to Mach. 85. Static Testing was conducted on a 10, 000 HP whirl rig at Wright Patterson Air Force Base. The test objectives were to investigate the Prop-Fan static aerodynamic and structural dynamic performance, determine the blade steady state <b>stressers</b> and deflections and to measure steady and unsteady pressures on the SR- 7 L blade surface. The measured performance of the LAP correlated well with analytical predictions at blade pitch angles below 30 deg. A stall buffet phenomenon was observed at blade pitch angles above 30 deg. This phenomenon manifested itself by elevated blade vibratory stress levels and lower than expected thrust produced and power absorbed by the Prop-Fan for a given speed and blade angle...|$|R

40|$|In banking sector, {{the retail}} banking is an {{important}} and generous sector of economy and job stress becomes progressively visible and increasing in this sector, {{after a series of}} arrangements for financial institutions. Therefore, the study of specific causes of job stress in the retail banking area should provide greater approach into both, theoretical and managerial practices. Several Studies have been conducted on role stressors and job satisfaction. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the effect of role stressors on job satisfaction by using job stress as mediator variable by applying different mediation approaches. The total distribution was 350 and questionnaires were collected from 305 employees and response rate was 87 percent. In the results of Correlation and Regression analysis，it was found that, role ambiguity and role conflict have negative relationship with job satisfaction. In the result of Regression it was concluded that job stress has influences among role ambiguity, role conflict and job satisfaction. The findings of the study suggest that role <b>stressers</b> should be controlled in order to increase the job satisfaction. Hence lesser the role stressors, lesser will be the job stress...|$|R
30|$|Study {{of recent}} attacks reveals that with little effort, next {{generation}} attack tools {{would be able}} to enact DDoS attacks that are thousand times stronger than the ones we see today [33]. One of the major concerns is that performing DDoS attack is extremely simple with websites known as Booters or <b>Stressers</b> that offer DDoS as a service. These booters provide cheap services, and the costs to perform a series of attacks is typically just a few dollars [36]. Recently, GitHub was hit by 1.35 Tbps of traffic all at once [2]. It was the most powerful attack in the history of DDoS, and the alarming fact is that no botnet was required to achieve such high traffic volume. The attackers spoofed GitHub’s IP addresses and took control of its memcached (a distributed memory system known for high performance and demand) instances. The memcached systems then return 50 times the data of the requests back to the victim. GitHub called Akamai Prolexic for DDoS mitigation service, and the assault dropped off after 8 min. GitHub was lucky enough to afford robust DDoS mitigation services, but for small to medium enterprises and financial institutions, {{there is a need for}} new low cost DDoS defense mechanisms and architectures that can be easily deployed on commodity hardware.|$|R
40|$|Background: Mental health {{problems}} {{are one of}} the leading causes of disability in Australia. General practitioners are often the first and only point of service for people suffering mental {{health problems}}, while many do not access services at all. University students can face numerous <b>stressers</b> in addition to academic demands that can contribute to the development or exacerbation of mental health problems. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} identify the prevalence of psychological symtoms in students who were patients at a university health service to enable appropriate planning of services to meet the needs of students. Methods: Participants were 384 students attending a university health service in urban Queensland over a period of 4 weeks during semester. At their first visit, patients completed the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, a measure of psychological distress. Results: Results showed there were significantly more patients experiencing high levels of distress compared with the general population and, consistent with the general population, almost two-thirds had not sought assistance for this distress. Increased distress was associated with increased disability among students. Discussion: Within a university setting, co-location of specialist mental health service can promise a team approach to mental health care, with GPs, psychiatrists and clinicl psychologists working together to increase the availability of care to students in need. The recent introduction of Medicare terms for psyhological treatment also facilitates greater access to clinical psyhologists and other mental health professionals...|$|R

In a fuzzy setting, the monotony condition may take several particular forms, all of them equivalent in the bivalent case. We study closure operators, called fuzzy closure operators with truth <b>stresser,</b> satisfying the monotony condition which can be linguistically described as "if it is (very) true that A is included in B then the closure of A {{is included in the}} closure of B. " We present examples of closure operators with truth <b>stresser,</b> investigate their basic properties and related structures...|$|E
40|$|DDoS-for-hire services, {{also known}} as booters, have commoditized DDoS attacks and enabled abusive {{subscribers}} of these services to cheaply extort, harass and intimidate businesses and people by knocking them offline. However, due to the underground nature of these booters, {{little is known about}} their underlying technical and business structure. In this paper we empirically measure many facets of their technical and payment infrastructure. We also perform an analysis of leaked and scraped data from three major booters [...] -Asylum <b>Stresser,</b> Lizard <b>Stresser</b> and VDO [...] -which provides us with an in-depth view of their customers and victims. Finally, we conduct a large-scale payment intervention in collaboration with PayPal and evaluate its effectiveness. Based on our analysis we show that these services are responsible {{for hundreds of thousands of}} DDoS attacks and identify potentially promising methods of increasing booters' costs and undermining these services...|$|E

We propose weaker axiomatizations that have as main advantages {{the preservation of}} standard completeness properties of the original logic {{and the fact that}} any subdiagonal (resp. su-perdiagonal) non-decreasing function on [0, 1] pre-serving 0 and 1 is a sound interpretation of the truth <b>stresser</b> (resp. depresser) connectives...|$|E
40|$|Many {{important}} mathematical {{properties are}} {{described in terms of}} implications between identities (equations). For example, many algebraic properties of an entropy function S = − ∑ pi · log(pi) hold under the condition that ∑ pi = 1, or, for additivity S({pi · qj}) = S({pi}) + S({qj}), under the conditions that ∑ pi = 1 and ∑ qj = 1. The corresponding formulas A 1 & · · · & An → B are particular cases of Horn formulas. What is a natural fuzzy analogue of such theories? The authors define a fuzzy theory as a fuzzy set µ of formulas, and define a fuzzy analogue of a Horn formula as a crisp implication (µ(A 1) ≥ w 1) & · · · & (µ(An) ≥ wn) → (µ(B) ≥ w) for some weights w 1, [...] ., wn, w. This definition can be reformulated inside fuzzy logic (without the need to consider crisp relations) if we add to the fuzzy logic, additional “truth <b>stresser</b> ” operations—such as a ∗ = 1 if a = 1 and a ∗ = 0 otherwise. The authors prove a general completeness theorem for the resulting logic: that for each statement, its degree of truth is equal to its degree of provability. All the descriptions and proofs are given in the general context of complete residual lattices, a context that contains BL-algebras, MV-algebras, Heyting algebras, etc., as particular cases...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this project}} was to {{describe}} how Indigenous health students and staff have experienced and responded to racism, {{in order to identify}} strategies that promote resilience and to explore how this knowledge can be translated into an organisational response in health service and tertiary education settings. It was thought that an exploration of bulletproofing might provide useful additional strategies to the main aim of reducing racism itself. Design and setting: This was a two-phase exploratory qualitative study involving interviews and a literature review conducted between 2004 and 2005. The twenty-six participants were Indigenous health service and academic staff and health students. Results: Each participant was able to recount many experiences of racism in classroom and health service settings, some of the most disturbing being that directed at patients. Participants described a small number of different racist events that were highly predictable and repeated over and again. Staff described the long-term stresses associated with racism, including the considerable stress associated with deciding whether and how to respond and the sense of success or failure associated with how this went. A strong sense of guilt was associated with not responding or responding {{in a way that was}} self-appraised as being ineffective. Long term staff described factors that promoted their personal resilience, which included having a number of ‘successes’ dealing with racist events, having support of other Indigenous staff and family and working in a supportive institutional environment. There have been a range of training programs, though few directly about racism, that have useful lessons for Indigenous resilience building. Conclusion: Racism was reported as a major <b>stresser</b> and was commonly experienced by Indigenous health students and staff. Resilience training is the under-explored flip-side of current cross-cultural training and along with improved institutional responses has the potential to increase the sense of well-being of Indigenous staff and students and their participation in the health professions. Bulletproofing Indigenous health students and staff, offers benefits while racism persists...|$|E
