5|$|Michael decides {{the workers}} are {{stressed}} because they are reluctant to express their feelings, so he organizes a comedic roast of himself in the warehouse. Dwight tricks most of the employees into signing his apology letter by pretending it is a <b>sign-in</b> sheet, but Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) catches on and refuses to sign it. Each {{of the office and}} warehouse workers gleefully take jabs at Michael, who initially seems to enjoy the jokes, but grows increasingly uncomfortable and offended. When it comes time for him to roast his employees, Michael ends up storming out of the warehouse, visibly upset. After the roast, Michael takes a personal day (much to the concern of his employees, who start to feel bad about the scathing jokes towards Michael) and spends time at a playground to reflect, feeding pigeons by tossing whole slices of bread on the ground and making bird noises, despite the lack of birds in the winter weather. Dwight tricks Phyllis into signing his apology letter by bribing a mailman to ask her to sign for a fake package. Michael returns to the office, where he roasts each of his co-workers with one-liners. Stanley laughs heartily when Michael roasts him, breaking the tension. Michael tells his employees that they are the reason he got into the paper business, and they applaud him.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, CBS {{struck a}} deal with Yahoo! to offer live {{streaming}} of the first three rounds of games under its Yahoo! Platinum service, for $16.95 a month. In 2004, CBS began selling viewers access to March Madness On Demand, which provided games not otherwise shown on broadcast television; the service was free for AOL subscribers. In 2006, March Madness On Demand was made free, and continued to be so to online users through the 2011 tournament. For 2012, it once again became a pay service, with a single payment of $3.99 providing access to all 67 tournament games. In 2013, the service, now renamed March Madness Live, was again made free, but uses Turner's rights and infrastructure for TV Everywhere, which requires <b>sign-in</b> though the password of a customer's cable or satellite provider to watch games, both via PC/Mac and mobile devices. Those that do not have a cable or satellite service or one not participating in Turner's TV Everywhere are restricted to games carried on the CBS national feed, the national semifinals and final (regardless of the broadcaster), and three hours (originally four) of other games without <b>sign-in,</b> or coverage via Westwood One's radio coverage.|$|E
25|$|The detectives {{visit the}} yacht club, where a valet (Grayson Gabriel) shares the guest <b>sign-in</b> log for October 5. Gwen's name is signed in at 8:37 p.m. with {{a license plate}} number that matches the {{campaign}} car in which Rosie's body was found. They question Gwen, who admits she recently lost her keycard but maintains she was at a Tacoma bed and breakfast {{on the night of}} Rosie's murder. Linden asks her about the campaign car, but she warns them to be careful with murder accusations. Later at Holder's apartment, Linden studies the grand opening photo and notices Jackson's former head of security had a broken arm. At the casino, the detectives tell Drays that Jackson framed her former head of security for murder and will eventually do the same to her. They demand to see all withheld casino security footage from the night of Rosie's murder.|$|E
25|$|After {{the first}} four episodes, the show gained its initial sponsor when Dr. Jules Montenier paid to have his product, Stopette spray deodorant, {{featured}} in advertising on the program. This involved featuring the product in the show's opening, {{on the front of}} the panel's desk, above the <b>sign-in</b> board, and on Daly's scorecards. In his last years, Cerf explained to interviewer Robbin Hawkins that Dr. Montenier was ultimately ruined by his refusal to abandon or share sponsorship as the show entered new markets and became too expensive. After Dr. Montenier sold Stopette to Helene Curtis, the series was sponsored by a variety of companies which were either regular or rotating. Sponsors were accorded the same exposure on the set as Stopette. One of the first rotating sponsors, which actually came before Montenier's sale of Stopette to Helene Curtis (who continued to sponsor the program after the purchase and still promoted Stopette in their advertising), was the Remington Rand Corporation, who used their time to promote their line of electric shavers and business machines such as the UNIVAC.|$|E
500|$|Fellow {{students}} described Cho as a [...] "quiet" [...] {{person who}} [...] "would not respond if someone greeted him." [...] Student Julie Poole recalled {{the first day}} of a literature class the previous year when the students introduced themselves one by one. When it was Cho's turn to introduce himself, he did not speak. According to Poole, the professor looked at the <b>sign-in</b> sheet and found that, whereas all the others had written out their names, Cho had written only a question mark. Poole added that [...] "we just really knew him as the question mark kid".|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{final moments}} linger on Dean [...] "meat-hooked {{in the center}} of what looks like a {{thousand}} mile spiderweb of rusty chains", a scene Kripke described as [...] "M. C. Escher meets Hellraiser". The original vision for the final scene would have placed Dean in a [...] "really nasty, bloody slaughterhouse, hanging from meat hooks". Here, Dean would start screaming as shadows fall over him. Discussions between Kripke, Manners, and Hayden led to the decision to present [...] "one epic glimpse" [...] of Hell, though they avoided aspects such as fire and brimstone to focus on more affordable visuals. Much debate went into the appearance of Hell because of its many variations. Though the scene matched with the many versions of [...] "chains and people being ripped apart", art director John Marcynuk felt they should have made it [...] "a little more mysterious and dark". He commented, [...] "My opinion is, the vaguer the better, because you let the imagination take over. People have different fears, and Hell's such a personal torment." [...] In series writer Sera Gamble's opinion, Dean's location is more of the [...] "waiting room"—the place [...] "they stick you before they hand you the <b>sign-in</b> sheet"—a far cry from what he will experience [...] "once he gets into the first chamber of Hell".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, Yellow Robe and Orson Welles both {{worked at the}} CBS Broadcast Center in New York as {{broadcast}} celebrities on different radio programs. Welles may have borrowed Yellow Robe’s name for the script of his classic film [...] "Citizen Kane [...] " [...] (1941), in which the title character's dying word is [...] "Rosebud." [...] Film critic David Thomson stated that {{the origin of the}} name [...] "Rosebud" [...] is the greatest secret in cinema." [...] The acclaimed film transformed a childhood sled into an icon of American culture, and there has been much speculation about the source of the name. [...] In 1991, Edward Castle, a reporter for The Las Vegas Sun, contended that it was Rosebud Yellow Robe’s name that inspired Welles after discovering daily <b>sign-in</b> sheets for the CBS Radio Network, where both Welles and Rosebud worked on dramatic shows during the same time period.|$|E
2500|$|To begin a round, Daly {{would invite}} the {{contestant}} to [...] "come in and sign in, please," [...] which, by 1960, had evolved {{to the more}} familiar [...] "enter and sign in, please." [...] The contestant entered by writing his or her name on a small <b>sign-in</b> board. [...] (For the first few telecasts, the contestants signed their names on an artist's sketch pad; but when {{the brightness of the}} studio lights made it difficult for the signatures to be seen clearly by the viewers, the white sketchpad was replaced by a black chalkboard.) [...] Daly would then usually ask where the guest lived and, with a woman, if she should be addressed as [...] "Miss" [...] or [...] "Mrs." [...] Early in the show's run, the panel was allowed to inspect contestants, studying their hands, or label on their suit or asking them to make a muscle.|$|E
2500|$|Wright's {{particular}} emphasis {{has been on}} what he asserts is a core feature of communication, that, in order for an updating {{to be set up}} and made possible, both speaker and hearer have to behave as if they have identified [...] "the same singular thing", which, he notes, partakes of the structure of a joke or a story. Wright says that this systematic ambiguity seems to opponents of qualia to be a sign of fallacy in the argument (as ambiguity is in pure logic) whereas, on the contrary, it is <b>sign—in</b> talk about [...] "what" [...] is perceived—of something those speaking to each other have to learn to take advantage of. In extending this analysis, he has been led to argue for an important feature of human communication being the degree and character of the faith maintained by the participants in the dialogue, a faith that has priority over what has before been taken to be the key virtues of language, such as [...] "sincerity", [...] "truth", and [...] "objectivity". Indeed, he considers that to prioritize them over faith is to move into superstition.|$|E

50|$|On May 22, 2013, former IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman {{testified that}} he had {{frequently}} visited the White House during 2010-2011, but he denied having discussed the targeting of conservatives with anyone in the White House. His testimony was criticized by several columnists. Some media outlets and lawmakers asserted that Shulman had visited the White House up to 157 times; however, The Atlantic reported that that represented {{the number of times}} Shulman was cleared by the Secret Service to visit the White House or the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, not necessarily the number of times Shulman actually arrived; visitor <b>sign-in</b> logs can confirm only 11 visits between 2009 and 2012, though the number is likely higher because the <b>sign-in</b> system does not capture every visitor, particularly at large events. Shulman was regularly scheduled for events like the biweekly health-care deputies meeting that would have had a standing list of people cleared to attend.|$|E
