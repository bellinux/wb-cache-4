40|$|This work {{describes}} a direct volume rendering technique adapted for visualization of results from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) flow solvers.

In addition, the data set sizes are often between ten and one hundred megabytes, which is large even by volume rendering standards. The method, a ray casting implementation, is chosen for its robustness and adaptability. The software described here differs from other volume renderers in the handling of vector field data and in the techniques for reducing the time required for intersecting rays with grid cell faces. Vector fields are rendered using mappings from the vector field space to three dimensional color spaces plus opacity. Several mappings are considered and the relative merits analyzed.

These characteristics include: merging/splitting pulses, sometimes resulting in simple pulse broadening; wave-front ‘tearing’; gaps/lacunae/polarity reversals in the ‘anomalous’ component arising from the eigenpolarization rotation; and incipient Hilbert transform-like first-motion changes due to indentations of the slow shear-wave slowness sheet...|$|R

Eight shot signals from five different sites near Cape Town were received at three widely spaced hydrophones at Ascension over a number of 4. 4 Megametre lines. These signals show the effects of (1) sources at different depths relative to the axis of the sound channel, (2) blocking and partial blocking of direct rays by seamounts and narrow undersea ridges and (3) a sound speed profile displaced downwards by a filament of warm surface water. Comparisons with ray trace and normal mode models show that some of the received signals consist of a combination of <b>slower,</b> refracted <b>rays</b> and faster rays reﬂected off Walvis ridge.

The result is considered by the author to indicate that the electronic orbits in the helium atom must be such as to bring the two electrons into the same part of the atomic volume at least one sixth of the time, a condition which is well satisfied by the recent models of Landé and Bohr in which the orbits cross each other.

Light however can only be sped up to a speed faster than it would travel in space, under certain conditions, and this restricts invisibility cloaks to work in a limited part of the spectrum, essentially just one colour. This would be ideal if somebody was planning to stand still in camouflage. However, the moment they start to move, the scenery would begin to distort, revealing the person under the cloak.

A verpy important problem regarding this kind of Ray Tracing, also known as Raster Ray Tracing, is the amount of memory required to store the 3 D raster grid which will contain the discretized scene to be visualized. Since the resolution of this grid is huge because the voxel is assumed to be approximately the size of a pixel on the screen, it is limited by the maximum amount of memory of todays´ machines. Although using case in most scenes, an important memory saving is achieved. This memory saving helps using discrete Ray Tracing in normal workstations. It is shown that the special octree presented here doesn´t <b>slow</b> down <b>Ray</b> Tracing significantly and even competes with normal discrete Ray-Tracing. It is also shown that in critical cases this octree will not occupy much more space than a normal 3 D grid. Another important problem is the bottleneck caused by the three-dimensional DDA in such huge resolution ones. The process can be divided in two steps where optimal times of three-dimensional DDA are achieved. This is shown through the comparative tests with the single step process...|$|R
