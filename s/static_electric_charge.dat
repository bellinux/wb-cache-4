The effects of static electricity are familiar to most people because people can feel, hear, and even see the spark as the excess charge is neutralized when brought close to a large electrical conductor (for example, a path to ground), or a region with an excess charge of the opposite polarity (positive or negative). The familiar phenomenon of a static shock–more specifically, an electrostatic discharge–is caused by the neutralization of charge.|$|E

40|$|Electrical cables that {{dissipate}} spurious <b>static</b> <b>electric</b> <b>charges,</b> {{in addition}} to performing their main functions of conducting signals, have been developed.

If the charging rate exceeds the dissipation rate, charges can accumulate in excessive amounts, giving rise to high-current discharges that can damage electronic circuitry and/or systems connected to it. The basic idea of design and operation of charge-dissipative electrical cables is to drain spurious charges to ground by use of lossy (slightly electrically conductive) dielectric layers, possibly in conjunction with drain wires and/or drain shields (see figure).

40|$|You have {{no doubt}} noticed that TV sets, light bulbs, and other {{electric}} appliances operate on 115 V, but electric ovens and clothes dryers usually need 220 V. Batteries may be rated at a harmless 1. 5, 6, 9, or 12 V, but a high-tension electric transmission line may provide electric power at 400, 000 V. Now just what physical quantity is measured by all these volts? How do volts relate to force, energy, and power, about which you have learned in earlier modules? The answer is that volts measure electric potential difference (sometimes called 2 ̆ 2 voltage 2 ̆ 2), which {{is derived from the}} potential energy acquired by electrically charged objects {{as a result of the}} electric forces they experience.

5000|$|Electrostatic induction, {{also known}} as [...] "electrostatic influence" [...] or simply [...] "influence" [...] in Europe and Latin America, is a {{redistribution}} of electrical charge in an object, caused by the influence of nearby charges.

[...] Induction was discovered by British scientist John Canton in 1753 and Swedish professor Johan Carl Wilcke in 1762. [...] Electrostatic generators, such as the Wimshurst machine, the Van de Graaff generator and the electrophorus, use this principle. Due to induction, the electrostatic potential (voltage) is constant at any point throughout a conductor.

Black toner particles adhere to areas on the paper that remain charged; discharged areas do not attract toner particles.

50|$|An {{electret}} is {{a stable}} dielectric material with a quasi-permanently embedded <b>static</b> <b>electric</b> <b>charge</b> (which, {{due to the}} high resistance of the material, will not decay for time periods of up to hundreds of years) and/or a quasi-permanently oriented dipole polarization. The name comes from electron (Greek word for amber) and magnet and was coined by Oliver Heaviside in 1885; drawing analogy {{to the formation of}} a magnet by alignment of magnetic domains in a piece of iron. Historically, electrets were made by first melting a suitable dielectric material such as a polymer or wax that contains polar molecules, and then allowing it to re-solidify in a powerful electrostatic field. The polar molecules of the dielectric align themselves to the direction of the electrostatic field, producing a dipole electret with a permanent electrostatic 'bias'. Modern electrets are usually made by embedding excess charges into a highly insulating dielectric, e.g. by means of an electron beam, a corona discharge, injection from an electron, electric breakdown across a gap or a dielectric barrier, etc.|$|E

Experiments were carried out to measure friction and wear of the tested materials. Based on the experimental observations, it can be noticed that the friction coefficient and wear are significantly influenced by the generation of <b>electric</b> <b>static</b> <b>charge</b> on the contact sur-faces, which causes an attractive force imposed to the normal load. It is found that wear is more influenced by the <b>electric</b> <b>static</b> <b>charge</b> than friction coefficient. Besides, {{the effect of the}} external voltage on generating <b>electric</b> <b>static</b> <b>charge</b> is higher than friction. Among the polymeric particles, crystalline polymers such as PE and PA perform more effectively than glassy polymers such as PMMA. Dispersing oil by polymeric particles does not decrease friction coefficient displayed by aluminium sliding against steel, while aluminium as cathode displays minimum wear.

The tape-stripping procedure consists in the sequential application and removal of adhesive tapes on the skin surface in order to remove stratum corneum (SC) layers, which electrically charges the skin surface. The skin <b>electric</b> <b>charges</b> generated by tape stripping highly change the skin friction behaviour by increasing the adhesion component of the skin friction coefficient. It has been proposed to rewrite the friction adhesion component as the sum of two terms: the first classical adhesion term depending on the intrinsic shear strength, τ 0, and the second term depending on the electric shear strength, τelec. The experimental results allowed to estimate a numerical value of the electric shear strength τelec. Moreover, a plan capacitor model with a dielectric material inside was used to modelize the experimental system. This physical model permitted to evaluate the friction electric force and the electric shear strength values to calculate the skin friction coefficient after the tape stripping. The comparison between the experimental and the theoretical value of the skin friction coefficient after the tape stripping has shown {{the importance of the}} <b>electric</b> <b>charges</b> on skin biotribological behaviour.
