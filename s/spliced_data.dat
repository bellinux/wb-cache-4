We show that using published, discontinuous data can lead to misleading results. The business-failure rate published by Dun and Bradstreet more than quadrupled from 1976 - 86, and has remained high since then (see Figure 1). However, in 1984 Dun and Bradstreet (D&B) extended the coverage of die failure series to all sectors, adding 40 - 90 % more firms between 1984 - 95. This made the series discontinuous, and research on failures has had to stop at 1983. 1 This paper redresses diat discontinuity, creating continuous failure series from underlying D&B industry data. The spliced rate of business failure has been 3 % higher than die published data, and reached the highest levels since the Depression in 1986 and 1993; die continuous average real size of failures has been 24 % lower for die <b>spliced</b> <b>data</b> than die published data.

40|$|Most of {{researches}} on image forensics {{have been}} mainly focused on detection of artifacts introduced {{by a single}} processing tool. They lead {{in the development of}} many specialized algorithms looking for one or more particular footprints under specific settings. Naturally, the performance of such algorithms are not perfect, and accordingly the provided output might be noisy, inaccurate and only partially correct. Furthermore, a forged image in practical scenarios is often the result of utilizing several tools available by image-processing software systems. Therefore, reliable tamper detection requires developing more poweful tools to deal with various tempering scenarios. Fusion of forgery detection tools based on Fuzzy Inference System has been used before for addressing this problem. Adjusting the membership functions and defining proper fuzzy rules for attaining to better results are time-consuming processes. This can be accounted as main disadvantage of fuzzy inference systems. In this paper, a Neuro-Fuzzy inference system for fusion of forgery detection tools is developed. The neural network characteristic of these systems provides appropriate tool for automatically adjusting the membership functions.

40|$|The nuclear gene MRS 2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes an {{integral}} protein (Mrs 2 p) {{of the inner}} mitochondrial membrane. It forms an ion channel mediating influx of Mg 2 + into mitochondria. Orthologues of Mrs 2 p {{have been shown to}} exist in other lower eukaryotes, in vertebrates and in plants. Characteristic features of the Mrs 2 protein family and the distantly related CorA proteins of bacteria are the presence of two adjacent transmembrane domains near the C terminus of Mrs 2 p one of which ends with a F/Y-G-M-N motif. Two coiled-coil domains and several conserved primary sequence blocks in the central part of Mrs 2 p are identified here as additional characteristics of the Mrs 2 p family. Gain-of-function mutations obtained upon random mutagenesis map to these conserved sequence blocks. They lead to moderate increases in mitochondrial Mg 2 + concentrations and concomitant positive effects on splicing of mutant group II intron RNA. Site-directed mutations in several conserved sequences reduce Mrs 2 p-mediated Mg 2 + uptake.

40|$|Noise in gene {{expression}} is a main determinant of phenotypic variability. Increasing experimental {{evidence suggests that}} genome-wide cellular constraints largely contribute to the heterogeneity observed in gene products. It is still unclear, however, which global factors affect {{gene expression}} noise and to what extent. Since eukaryotic gene expression is an energy demanding process, differences in the energy budget of each cell could determine gene expression differences. Here, we quantify the contribution of mitochondrial variability (a natural source of ATP variation) to global variability in gene expression. We find that changes in mitochondrial content can account for ∼ 50 % of the variability observed in protein levels. This is the combined result {{of the effect of}} mitochondria dosage on transcription and translation apparatus content and activities. Moreover, we find that mitochondrial levels have a large impact on alternative splicing, thus modulating both the abundance and type of mRNAs. A simple mathematical model in which mitochondrial content simultaneously affects transcription rate and splicing site choice can explain the alternative <b>splicing</b> <b>data.</b> The results of this study show that mitochondrial content (and/or probably function) influences mRNA abundance, translation, and alternative splicing, which ultimately affects cellular phenotype.

40|$|Ceramides are {{bioactive}} lipids {{that can}} promote splicing of apoptosis-related genes, including caspase 9 and BCL-x. A recent study demonstrated that expression of neutral sphingomyelinase (NSMase), an enzyme that hydrolyzes sphingomyelins to generate ceramide, is regulated by Group VIA phospholipase A 2 (iPLA 2 β) -dependent mechanism during β-cell apoptosis. This prompted us to hypothesize that iPLA 2 is upstream of ceramide generation {{in the process}} regulating splicing of apoptotic genes. To test this, Jurkat T cells were treated with the selective inhibitor of iPLA 2 β, bromoenol lactone (BEL), RNA was isolated and converted to cDNA, and caspase 9 and BCL-x mRNA viii species were amplified using RT-PCR. Inhibition of iPLA 2 β activity with BEL caused a significant shift in splicing favoring variants encoding the anti-apoptotic forms of caspase 9 (caspase 9 b) and BCL-x (BCL-x(L)). This shift was consistent with previously reported effects of ceramide and suggested that iPLA 2 β regulates splicing of these pre-mRNAs. We next determined whether iPLA 2 β regulates splicing events during a biological response. Caspase- 9 and BCL-x splice variants were compared in human and mouse islets, mouse islet cell lines, and in rat insulinoma (INS 1) cells. INS- 1 insulinoma cells were treated with thapsigargin to induce ER stress, which can eventually lead to apoptosis.

Although the genetic basis for aggression is widely accepted, only a few individual candidate genes have been studied. Recent studies have indicated that Drosophila melanogaster can serve as a powerful model system to study the genetics of aggression. The aim of this project was to identify genes associated with aggression by global profiling of the fly transcriptome using DNA expression microarrays. At the core of this study was a behavioural screen in which the aggression of 910 pairs of males was observed and scored. Microarray analysis revealed 350 genes that were differentially expressed between aggressive and nonaggressive flies. Several biological functions such as translation activity, immune response, ion transport, and sensory transduction were significantly over-represented. Analysis of the upstream region of these genes also suggested several shared motifs that might serve as transcription factor binding sites that drive the co-expression of these genes. One of the top differentially expressed genes was Dat, (dopamine-Nacetyltransferase), which was upregulated in aggressive flies. Dat has two isoforms generated by alternative <b>splicing,</b> <b>DatA</b> and DatB. QPCR analysis revealed that only DatB is upregulated in aggressive flies. In Datlo mutants that express only DatB, aggression is also increased, an effect that can be reverted by over-expressing the DatA transgene. Additional experiments over-expressing DatB indicate that the two isoforms effectively act in opposite ways to regulate aggression, suggesting that a balance between them is necessary for adaptive levels of aggression. Another candidate gene was CG 6480, whose levels were reduced in aggressive flies. The function of this gene is unknown, but it does share a conserved motif called Fascin with its mammalian ortholog frg 1. Silencing this gene by dsRNAi resulted in flies that show elevated levels of aggression. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
