50|$|The use of Boeing's GeoMobile {{platform}} {{will allow}} for coverage of the entire United States with a single satellite. This new approach to <b>satellite</b> <b>telephony</b> has already been validated with the Thuraya network. MSV's satellite will use an even bigger antenna than the Thuraya spacecraft (at 22 meters in diameter, {{it will be the}} largest commercial reflector dish ever used in space), allowing it to communicate with phones no larger than modern cell phones because the large antenna gain allows the handset to operate at a power output comparable to regular cell phones. This is now possible since the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) allowed satellite operators to create terrestrial cellular networks using spectrum previously restricted to satellite use, which means that phones can be compatible with both the upcoming MSV satellite phone network and local cellular networks, allowing a user to communicate over the regular cellular network, and only rely on the satellites in areas outside the range of cell towers. MSV has earned patents for this set-up. It will be useful in sparsely populated areas where the construction of cell towers is not cost-effective, as well as to emergency-response services which must remain operational even when the local cellular network is out of service.|$|E

40|$|Presented {{here is a}} {{signalling}} system optimized to ensure expedient call set-up for <b>satellite</b> <b>telephony</b> services in a land mobile environment. In a land mobile environment, the satellite to mobile link is subject to impairments from multipath and shadowing phenomena, which result in signal amplitude and phase variations. Multipath, caused by signal scattering and reflections, results in sufficient link margin to compensate for these variations. Direct signal attenuation caused by shadowing due to buildings and vegetation may result in attenuation values in excess of 10 dB and commonly up to 20 dB. It is not practical to provide a link with sufficient margin to enable communication when the signal is blocked. When a moving vehicle passes these obstacles, the link will experience rapid changes in signal strength due to shadowing. Using statistical models of attenuation {{as a function of}} distance travelled, a communication strategy has been defined for the land mobile environment...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Masters Diploma(Technology)) [...] Cape Technikon, Cape Town, 1989 Soekor's {{exploration}} programme {{has moved}} totally offshore and expanded greatly {{in the past}} few years. Use of computers necessitated the exchange of data between offshore and land installations. At the same time the exploration programme is moving further offshore While the coastal. stations of the Post & Telecommunications can not handle the volume of traffic that the oil drills present nor the data modes. A study of the transmission requirements revealed that a minimum of one voice channel per drill must be available at all times, While Some 20 M byte of data per oil drill per year will be transmitted. Facsimile will be needed at times, also as a back-up for the data systems. A study of publications revealed that only five of the eleven methods studied where viable, namely VHF-EM, satellite, HF-telephony, HF-teleprinter and HF-data. These possibilities as well as their practical implementation were studied in depth. The effect of the atmospheric conditions on the propagation of VHF-signals around the coastline was studied and 17 sites identified and evaluated {{from the mouth of the}} Orange River to Port Elizabeth in respect of coverage, accessibility, facilities and cost.

40|$|Abstract In {{developing}} countries Doctors or Physicians don’t {{like to go}} to the rural areas and people of rural (backwards) areas are not facilitated up to the mark. Thus the disaster situation occurs when these people are transferred to the city hospital for tertiary and mostly even for primary care. Advancement in the field of communications provided the solution in the form of Telemedicine. Telemedicine is “the practice of health care using interactive audio, visual and data communications. This includes health care delivery, diagnosis, consultation and treatment, as well as education and transfer of medical data”. Today, Telemedicine systems are supported by State of the Art Technologies like Interactive video, high resolution monitors, high speed computer networks and switching systems, and telecommunications superhighways including fiber optics, <b>satellites</b> and cellular <b>telephony.</b> This paper deals with the design and analysis of a telemedicine system. We have proposed a cost effective multipurpose model of the telemedicine system needed for the {{developing countries}}. The proposed telemedicine system has two major parts: a telemedicine unit (patient side) and a base unit (Doctors side). We have shown that how the interconnectivity through high-speed network forms the complete system. The applications of this system includes as: Ambulances, Rural Health Centers (RHC) and Ships navigating in wide seas are as possible emergency sites, while critical care telemetry and Telemedicine home follow-ups are important issues of telemonitoring. By using these facilities we approach towards a mobile doctor...|$|R
40|$|The {{availability}} of feedback in communication channels can significantly increase {{the reliability of}} transmission while decreasing the encoding and decoding complexity. Most of the applications like cellular <b>telephony,</b> <b>satellite</b> communications and internet involve two-way transmission. Hence, {{it is important to}} devise coding schemes which utilize the advantages of feedback. Most of the results in code designs, which make use of feedback, concentrate on noiseless and instantaneous feedback. But in real-time systems, the feedback is usually noisy, and is available at the transmitter after some delay. Hence, {{it is important that we}} characterize the gains obtained in this case over that of one-way channels. We consider binary erasure channels to keep the problem tractable. For the erasure channels with noisy feedback, we have designed and analyzed a concatenated coding scheme, which achieves lower probability of error than any forward error correcting code of the same rate. Hence, it is shown that even noisy feedback can be useful in increasing the reliability of the channel. We have designed and analyzed a coding scheme using Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes along with selective retransmission strategy, which utilizes the limited (but noiseless), delayed feedback to achieve low frame error rates even with small blocklengths, at rates close to capacity. Furthermore, our scheme provides a way to trade off feedback bandwidth for reliability. The complexity of this scheme is lower than that of a forward error correcting code (FEC) of same blocklength and comparable performance. We have shown that our scheme performs better than the Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) protocol which makes use of 1 bit feedback to signal retransmissions. For fair comparisons, we have also incorporated the rate loss due to the bits which are fed back in addition to the retransmitted bits. Thus, we have shown that for two-way communications with complexity and delay constraints, it is better to utilize the {{availability of}} feedback than to use just FEC...|$|R
