Because of bad publicity in the Kansas City area from his friendship with a previous Hindu teacher, Lynn and Yogananda agreed to avoid publicity regarding their association.During the following twenty years, Lynn paid frequent visits to Yogananda at his Self-Realization Fellowship headquarters in Los Angeles, California. In 1935 when Yogananda was planning his trip to India, Lynn generously insisted on making a donation for his travels. While Yogananda was gone, Lynn purchased and built the large estate in Encinitas, California {{as a gift to}} Yogananda and his organization, Self-Realization Fellowship. Yogananda wrote in his Autobiography of a Yogi:"During my stay in India and Europe (June 1935 - October 1936), Mr. Lynn had lovingly plotted with my correspondents in California to prevent any word from reaching me about the construction of the ashram in Encinitas. Astonishment, delight!" [...] Lynn eventually moved to an apartment in the Encinitas retreat/ashram center. The two spent long hours together over the years, meditating and discussing spiritual matters. Mr. Lynn said of his relationship with Yogananda:"One of the blessings I have received in my friendship with Paramahansa Yogananda has been permanent relief from a state of nervousness, a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>strain,</b> an inward state of uncertainty. I have gained calmness, peace, joy, and a sense of security that cannot come to anyone until he has found the true security of the soul." [...] and [...] "How heavenly is the company of a saint!

50|$|In {{mechanics}} of material, {{the strength of}} a material is its ability to withstand an applied load without failure or plastic deformation.The field of strength of materials deals with forces and deformations that result from their acting on a material.A load applied to a mechanical member will induce internal forces within the member called stresses when those forces are expressed on a unit basis. The stresses acting on the material cause deformation of the material in various manners. Deformation of the material is called strain when those deformations too are placed on a unit basis. The applied loads may be axial (tensile or compressive), or rotational (strength shear). The stresses and strains that develop within a mechanical member must be calculated in order to assess the load capacity of that member. This requires a complete description of the geometry of the member, its constraints, the loads applied to the member and the properties of the material of which the member is composed. With a complete description of the loading and the geometry of the member, the state of stress and of <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> at any point within the member can be calculated. Once the state of stress and strain within the member is known, the strength (load carrying capacity) of that member, its deformations (stiffness qualities), and its stability (ability to maintain its original configuration) can be calculated. The calculated stresses may then be compared to some measure of the strength of the member such as its material yield or ultimate strength. The calculated deflection of the member may be compared to a deflection criteria that is based on the member's use. The calculated buckling load of the member may be compared to the applied load. The calculated stiffness and mass distribution of the member may be used to calculate the member's dynamic response and then compared to the acoustic environment in which it will be used.|$|E

We found that the inclusion <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> promotes the type-II nature by confining the electrons and holes in nonadjacent regions. This carrier separation is more efficient than that with type-II spherical nanocrystals. The strain leads to a small blue shift of the lowest exciton energy. Its magnitude is smaller than the red shift induced by increasing the shell thickness. Moreover, the larger arm diameter reduces the influence of both shell thickness and strain on the exciton energy. Considering the broken symmetry, a randomness induced carrier separation was revealed which is unique to a branched core-shell structure. The calculated shell thickness dependence of the emission energy agrees well with available experimental data. Comment: 6 figure...|$|R
