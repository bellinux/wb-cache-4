Chris Sorrell, previously {{known for the}} James Pond series of games, created the original concept for MediEvil and served as the game's creative director. Sorrell joined Millennium, {{with whom he had}} been working with for a while, after completing James Pond 3. When asked what he wanted to do, {{he said he wanted to}} work with <b>someone</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> visual side. Jason Wilson, who would be the designer and a writer for the game, met up with Sorrell and began working on MediEvil.|$|E

The first call came from <b>someone</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> street who saw smoke coming from the building. During the first 911 call, at about 8:27 PM, the alarm company alerted the fire department to the fire. Engine 43 was the first firefighting unit to arrive at the scene and reported seeing heavy smoke and flames in one of the windows. As firefighters started fighting the fire it had grown with flames breaking through windows and lapping {{up the side of the}} building.|$|E

5|$|In 1927, Beebe went on an {{expedition}} to Haiti in order to document its marine life. Anchoring his ship the Lieutenant in the harbor of Port-au-Prince, he performed over 300 helmet dives examining the area's coral reefs and classifying the fish that inhabited them. These dives involved several technological innovations: a watertight brass box {{which could be used}} to house a camera for underwater photography, and a telephone which was incorporated into the diving helmet, allowing the diver to dictate observations to <b>someone</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface instead of having to take notes underwater. Within a hundred days, Beebe and his team had created a catalog of species inhabiting the area nearly as long as what had been assembled on the neighboring island of Puerto Rico in the past four hundred years. In 1928 Beebe and Tee-Van published an illustrated and annotated list of 270 such species, which was expanded in 1935 bringing the total to 324. Beebe provided an account of this expedition in his 1928 book Beneath Tropic Seas, which was the first of his books to receive less than enthusiastic reviews, due to its episodic structure.|$|E

25|$|After {{shakedown}} {{training off}} the New England coast, Snook departed New London on 3 March 1943 and set sail for the Pacific. Following a 12-day stopover at Pearl Harbor, the submarine put to sea on 11 April {{and headed for}} the Yellow Sea and East China Sea for her first war patrol. Upon completion of mine planting in the Shanghai area, Snook continued on up the coast of China to the Yellow Sea. On the afternoon of 5 May, she sighted two freighters standing out of Dairen and took up the chase. She trailed both until after nightfall, then fired a spread of three torpedoes that quickly sank Kinko Maru. The lead freighter continued, unaware of the attack, until <b>someone</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sinking ship sounded a whistle. At that point, the freighter began a series of frantic maneuvers to dodge two of Snooks torpedoes, then opened fire with her guns, forcing the submarine to withdraw out of range, returning shortly after and firing three torpedoes, one of which hit Daifuku Maru amidships and sank her. Snook then resumed patrol.|$|E

25|$|Mercier, a Montreal journalist, {{started to}} realize how much {{corruption}} and integration into the community the group had one he began to follow one of the assault cases through the courts. The case was involving {{one of the young}} Dubois brothers and a merchant from St. Henri who had been beaten after he had refused to pay his daily receipt to the brothersâ€™ hold up men. Mercier believed that the Dubois Brothers were getting help from <b>someone</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> inside as the victim was almost sentenced and the Dubois brother had only received a small fine. The Dubois Brothers also received permits, swung votes to which person they wanted through intimidation and were able to get judges to give reduced sentences. They had corrupted a journalist in order to have the journalist change information they needed and report information they wanted out but with his change of careers, due to the company finding out about his corruption, the Dubois Brothers turned him into their lawyer opening an office and giving them legal information. They were able to corrupt politicians, the police, judges and lawyers according to Mercier causing them a vast integration into society.|$|E

Diana reveals that Rebecca knew about Paul's affair and Brennan brings Rebecca to the station. Declan asks Kate to provide a false alibi for Rebecca and she agrees. Brennan then questions Declan and Summer Hoyland, who tells him about Andrew wishing Paul dead. Andrew is questioned and released. He then teams up with Summer and Natasha Williams (Valentina Novakovic) to investigate the crime. Andrew suspects Sonya when he learns that she has a criminal record for assault and no alibi. Sonya is questioned and released. The teens follow Diana, who meet with Jack. Natasha gets Jack's phone and Andrew gives it to Brennan, who then arrests Diana for conspiracy to commit murder. Soon after, Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) receives anonymous texts telling her that Diana did not push Paul.

In 2011, director Chris Buck {{began work on}} another attempted adaption and also faced challenges with the Snow Queen character. Producer Peter Del Vecho explained that this was primarily because she was not relatable and too isolated, having no personal connections. As a result, they could not explain her motivations. After several changes were proposed, <b>someone</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> writing team suggested making the Snow Queen Anna's sister.

[...] When a second, larger, parley arrived to discuss the release of the two captives and the ships, the situation turned nasty when Captain Rogers, leader of the party, was insulted. [...] After he fired at <b>someone</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> occupied ship, the British responded in kind, wounding one and very nearly sinking the parley group's boat. [...] Following that boat's retreat, McIntosh opened fire with the cannons on the bluff, beginning a gunbattle that lasted for four hours.|$|E

500|$|There {{are many}} other {{tradition}}s at FIU that are not spirit-related. The [...] "Kissing Bridge" [...] tradition in Turtle Pond in between the Ryder Business Building and Green Library. The tradition {{is that if you}} kiss <b>someone</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bridge you will stay with them forever. The top floor of Green Library is said to be haunted; students have reported a friendly ghost that wanders the halls minutes before the library closes at night. Another superstition is that if a student steps on the university seal engraved in front of the Graham Center and in the WUC at the Biscayne Bay Campus, the university's student union, it is said that they will delay their graduation for many years, or never graduate at all, and thus even on crowded days, students go around the seal to avoid stepping on it (a variation based on superstitions from hundreds of universities nationwide).|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} {{character of}} Gerda, known as Anna, {{was one of}} the three major characters in the script at this time, along with the Snow Queen, Elsa and Kristoff, loosely based on Kay.

This changed the story dramatically, shifting from the conflict between the good and the evil to the conflict between love and fear. Buck stated that their script still retained basic parts of the story and the character of Gerda, citing the similarities between the original story and his version, [...] " [...] won't give up on finding her friend Kai. The only thing she really has in her, she's not a superhero or anything, but she has love. And it's love that conquers fear in the end." ...|$|E
