40|$|Cost {{reduction}} of silicon {{materials in the}} photovoltaic program of materials was examined. The current process of producing <b>silicon</b> <b>sheets</b> is based entirely on the conventional Czochralski ingot growth and wafering used in the semiconductor industry. The current technology cannot meet the cost reduction demands for producing low cost <b>silicon</b> <b>sheets.</b> Alternative sheet production processes such as unconventional crystallization are needed. The production of polycrystalline <b>silicon</b> <b>sheets</b> by unconventional ingot technology is the casting technique. Though large grain sheets were obtained by this technique, silicon ribbon growth overcomes deficiencies of the casting process by obtaining the sheet directly from the melt. The need to solve difficulties of growth stability and impurity effects are examined. The direct formation process of polycrystalline <b>silicon</b> <b>sheets</b> with large grain size, smooth surface, and sharp edges from the melt with a high growth rate which will yield low cost <b>silicon</b> <b>sheets</b> for solar cells and the photovoltaic characteristics associated {{with this type of}} sheet to include an EBIC study of the grain boundaries are described...|$|R

Technology projection and sensitivity analysis suggest that single-ribbon growth systems offer the best potential for achieving low-cost <b>silicon</b> <b>sheet</b> material within the shortest period of time. Such systems must be highly reliable, be capable of near unattended growth, and feature automatic melt replenishment. Processing-technology improvement, such as the following, are the key elements for reducing the cost of <b>silicon</b> <b>sheet</b> material: (i) increasing ribbon width; (ii) speeding up the growth rate; and (iii) decreasing ribbon thickness. Such tasks should be pursued in that order to minimize sheet material cost.
