500|$|Mathieu Amalric as Dominic Greene, {{the main}} villain. He {{is a leading}} member of Quantum posing as a {{businessman}} working in reforestation and charity funding for environmental science. In the 2015 Bond film Spectre, he is revealed {{to have been a}} member of the titular crime syndicate, of which Quantum is a subsidiary. Amalric acknowledged taking the role was an easy decision because, [...] "It's impossible to <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> kids that 'I could have been in a Bond film but I refused.'" [...] Amalric wanted to wear make-up for the role, but Forster explained that he wanted Greene not to look grotesque, but to symbolise the hidden evils in society. Amalric modelled his performance on [...] "the smile of Tony Blair [...] the craziness of Sarkozy," [...] the latter of whom he called [...] "the worst villain we [...] have ever had... he walks around thinking he's in a Bond film." [...] He later claimed this was not criticism of either politician, but rather an example of how a politician relies on performance instead of a genuine policy to win power. [...] "Sarkozy, is just a better actor than [...] Ségolène Royal—that's all," [...] he explained. Amalric and Forster reconceived the character, who was supposed to have a [...] "special skill" [...] in the script, to someone who uses pure animal instinct when fighting Bond in the climax. Bruno Ganz was also considered for the part, but Forster decided Amalric gave the character a [...] "pitiful" [...] quality.|$|E

So turn off the TV set, put the video game away. Buy a little desk or put that child by the kitchen table. Watch them do their homework. If they don't know how to do it, give them help. If you don't know how to do it, call the teacher. Make them go to bed at a {{reasonable}} time. Keep them off the streets. Give 'em some breakfast... I also know that if folks letting our children drink eight sodas a day, which some parents do, or, you know, eat a bag of potato chips for lunch, or Popeyes for breakfast [...] You can't do that.
