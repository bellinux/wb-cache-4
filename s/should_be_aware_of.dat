5|$|Partner {{communication}} {{is essential in}} a good defense. When one partner is under attack, the other partner <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> which pieces hurt most. Sitting strategies might be necessary, and it is therefore important to play the defense fast. Accepting a sacrifice can be lethal. On the other hand, it results in the attacker having a piece less to play with, with the defender's partner having a piece more. Sacrifices therefore give the partner of the defender {{an opportunity to take}} initiative.|$|E
5|$|Routine {{screening}} of asymptomatic {{people is not}} indicated, since the disease is highly curable in its early, symptomatic stages. Instead, women, particularly menopausal women, <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the symptoms and risk factors of endometrial cancer. A cervical screening test, such as a Pap smear, is not a useful diagnostic tool for endometrial cancer because the smear will be normal 50% of the time. A Pap smear can detect disease that has spread to the cervix. Results from a pelvic examination are frequently normal, especially {{in the early stages}} of disease. Changes in the size, shape or consistency of the uterus and/or its surrounding, supporting structures may exist when the disease is more advanced. Cervical stenosis, the narrowing of the cervical opening, is a sign of endometrial cancer when pus or blood is found collected in the uterus (pyometra or hematometra).|$|E

25|$|Everyone {{who uses}} a laser <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the risks. This {{awareness}} {{is not just a}} matter of time spent with lasers; to the contrary, long-term dealing with invisible risks (such as from infrared laser beams) tends to reduce risk awareness primarily due to complacency, rather than to sharpen it.|$|E
25|$|Mammomonogamiasis is not {{considered}} an emerging disease because of the rarity of cases. Consequently, no control measures are currently being implemented.

25|$|Non-archaeologists <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the {{limitations}} of ceramic typology. All such typologies are abstractions, and fail to describe all of the variability in an artistic tradition. Professional disagreement over specifics is common. Changes in ceramic design did not happen overnight, and archaeological typologies tend to break continua of design evolution into arbitrary (but highly useful) units. Most archaeological dates are approximate.|$|E

25|$|Long-term use of PPIs is {{strongly}} associated {{with the development of}} benign polyps from fundic glands (which is distinct from fundic gland polyposis); these polyps do not cause cancer and resolve when PPIs are discontinued. No association is seen between PPI use and cancer, but use of PPIs may mask gastric cancers or other serious gastric problems and physicians <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> this effect.|$|E

These cases are far beyond the scope of the current article which concentrates on transverse waves (such as most electromagnetic waves in bulk media), however one <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> cases where the polarization of a coherent wave cannot be described simply using a Jones vector, as we have just done.|$|E

25|$|Due to the breed's stoic nature, {{injuries}} can {{go unnoticed}} {{for a time}} as the dog will not give obvious signs of pain or distress like whining. For example, the first indication of a cut on the foot might be limping or favoring that foot {{a few days after}} the actual injury, so owners <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> their pets usual movement to spot irregularities. Excessive licking of a spot may also indicate a problem other than the skin conditions listed above.|$|E
25|$|A {{careful study}} of the {{synchronisation}} between the kings, chieftains and the poets suggested by these colophons indicates that this body of literature reflect occurrences within a period {{of four or five}} continuous generations at the most, a period of 120 or 150 years. Any attempt at extracting a systematic chronology and data from these poems <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the casual nature of these poems and the wide difference between the purposes of the anthologist who collected these poems and the historian’s attempts are arriving at a continuous history.|$|E
25|$|During complex situations, {{communication}} between health professionals {{must be at}} its best. There are several techniques, tools, and strategies used to improve communication.

To increase the quality of {{communication between}} people involved, regular feedback should be provided. Strategies such as briefings allow the team to be set on their purpose and ensure that members not only share the goal but also the process they will follow to achieve it. Briefings reduce interruptions, prevent delays and build stronger relationships, resulting in a strong patient safety environment.|$|E

25|$|The American Eskimo is a {{hardy breed}} {{with an average}} life span of 12–15 years. This breed tends to become {{overweight}} easily, so proper diet and exercise is needed to maintain an overall well being. Health testing should be performed by all responsible breeders and anyone purchasing a puppy <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the genetic problems which {{have been found in}} some individuals of the breed, such as PRA (Progressive Retinal Atrophy), luxating patella, and hip dysplasia). None of these problems are common and the breed is generally very healthy. In addition to the rarer problems mentioned, the breed can have a tendency towards allergies and most commonly, tear-staining. This breed also is known in some cases to have dental issues.|$|E
25|$|Pre-facelift vs Facelift. In {{respect of}} FTO ownership, {{there is some}} {{division}} in preference for the styling of the front bumper - either Pre-facelift, or Facelift. Interchanging these units is a relatively simple matter and, as the latter version models have become write-offs over the years, there are many pre-facelift models now {{on the road that}} are sporting newer facelift bumpers. Future purchasers of an FTO <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> this. A simple check of the VIN Plate details, or the period of manufacture to be found on the seat-belt tags, should resolve any uncertainty as to the origin of the model-build. Apart from body styling, there are other less apparent differences in the Facelift models, such as uprated ECU and also distinct variations to the drive shaft units across the range. Such as 25 or 27-spline shafts and CV cup variants, as well as fitment for ABS or non-ABS shafts and bearings for same.|$|E
500|$|... "Dear Future Husband" [...] is a doo-wop song, and lyrically {{comprises}} a list {{of factors}} Trainor's love interests <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> before proposing to her. Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone dubbed the song [...] "a YA dream that's no pastel-colored fantasy," [...] and opined, [...] " [...] imagines marriage as contract between equals who work and don't cook". The melody in [...] "Dear Future Husband" [...] was likened to American singer Dion's [...] "Runaround Sue" [...] (1961), and sonically the song comprises a series of slick production slap-beats, a rock-inspired drum track, zippy piano and ebullient brass instrumentation. The EP's final track, [...] "Close Your Eyes" [...] is a modern slow dance ballad about ignoring negativity and loving yourself on your own terms. Backed by an acoustic guitar, Trainor solicits a nuanced, soulful, fluttery vocal performance afront pitch-shifted background vocals on the track.|$|E
