5|$|Separately, the {{experimental}} Arwinss branch was created {{as an alternative}} means to improve USER32 and GDI32 support through an alternative implementation of the Win32 API. Whereas ReactOS's original Win32 subsystem was closely modeled after its equivalent in Windows, Arwinss combines the architecture of that subsystem with the corresponding implementation in Wine. To this end, Arwinss uses Wine's GDI32 and USER32 libraries with few changes to take fuller advantage of Wine's existing <b>software</b> <b>compatibility.</b> Arwinss also allows the user to optionally use a remote X server instead of a local display.|$|E
5|$|In July 2008 Juniper's first CEO, Scott Kriens, became {{chairman}} and former Microsoft executive Kevin Johnson was appointed CEO. Johnson focused the company more on software, creating a software solutions division {{headed by a}} former Microsoft colleague, Bob Muglia. Juniper also hired other former Microsoft executives {{to focus on the}} company's software strategy and encourage developers to create software products that run on the Junos operating system. Juniper established partnerships with IBM, Microsoft and Oracle for <b>software</b> <b>compatibility</b> efforts. The SSL/VPN Pulse product family was launched in 2010, then later spun off to a private equity firm in 2014 for $250 million.|$|E

25|$|The Alpha has a 64-bit linear {{virtual address}} space with no memory segmentation. Implementations can {{implement}} a smaller virtual address {{space with a}} minimum size of 43 bits. Although the unused bits were not implemented in hardware such as TLBs, the architecture required implementations to check whether they are zero to ensure <b>software</b> <b>compatibility</b> with implementations with a larger (or full) virtual address space.|$|E
25|$|The 68EC000 {{was used}} as a {{controller}} in many audio applications, including Ensoniq musical instruments and sound cards, where {{it was part of the}} MIDI synthesizer. On Ensoniq sound boards, the controller provided several advantages compared to competitors without a CPU on board. The processor allowed the board to be configured to perform various audio tasks, such as MPU-401 MIDI synthesis or MT-32 emulation, without the use of a TSR program. This improved <b>software</b> <b>compatibility,</b> lowered CPU usage, and eliminated host system memory usage.|$|E

500|$|Due to the {{different}} architecture of ARM-based devices compared to x86 devices, Windows RT has <b>software</b> <b>compatibility</b> limitations. Although the operating system still provides the traditional Windows desktop environment alongside Windows 8's touch-oriented user interface, the only desktop applications officially supported by Windows RT are those {{that come with the}} operating system itself; such as File Explorer, Internet Explorer, and Office RT. Only Windows Store apps can be installed by users on Windows RT devices; they must be obtained from Windows Store or sideloaded in enterprise environments. Developers cannot port desktop applications to run on Windows RT, since Microsoft developers felt {{that they would not be}} properly optimized for the platform. As a consequence, Windows RT also does not support [...] "new-experience enabled" [...] web browsers: a special class of app used on Windows 8 that allows web browsers to bundle variants that can run in the Windows RT [...] "modern-style user interface" [...] and integrate with other apps, but still use Win32 code like desktop programs.|$|E

50|$|Many early {{computer}} systems {{did not have}} any form of hardware abstraction. This meant that anyone writing a program for such a system would have to know how each hardware device communicated {{with the rest of the}} system. This was a significant challenge to software developers since they then had to know how every hardware device in a system worked to ensure the <b>software's</b> <b>compatibility.</b> With hardware abstraction, rather than the program communicating directly with the hardware device, it communicates to the operating system what the device should do, which then generates a hardware-dependent instruction to the device. This meant programmers didn't need to know how specific devices worked, making their programs compatible with any device.|$|R

A new [...] "Action Center" [...] interface was also added to provide an overview of system security and maintenance information, and tweaks were made to the User Account Control system to make it less intrusive.
