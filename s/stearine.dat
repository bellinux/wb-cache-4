There are four distinct departments: 1. The manufacture of soap - toilet, household and soft, 2. <b>Stearine</b> and parafine candles, 3. Refining glycerine, 4. Making all kinds of lubricating oils and machinery grease. [...] The soap department is very nearly in full swing. Toilet soap was started last Saturday. Large quantities of candles are being turned out, which have to be pronounced up to the highest standard, imported or colonial. Preparations are in full swing for exhibiting the works in the fullest manner {{on the occasion of}} Lord & Lady Carrington's visit.

2500|$|The second factory, {{opened in}} 1900 at Sturt Street, {{previously}} owned by competitor Tidmarsh & Co, occupied 4 acres of floor space ( [...] 19,000 sq yards / 16,000m2 / 1.6 hectares [...] ) and employing over 200 men. Its most salient feature was the brick chimney – 152ft 4in (46.5m) in height and a flue diameter of 4ft (1.2m), and still standing (though no longer used). The boiler room housed four boilers, {{one of which}} was 27ft long and 7ft 6in in diameter (8.2m x 2.3m) and the largest to have been built in South Australia. The still-room had six large stills: four for distillation of <b>stearine</b> and two for glycerine. The building was organised so that manufacture started on the top floor and progressed by chutes or conveyors to the second floor for wrapping and packaging, thence to the ground floor, all with a minimum of handling. The smell emanating from the Sturt Street factory, despite installation of deep drainage, was the source of much complaint from neighbours.|$|E

Then, again, there is no moisture in the flesh; but its place is supplied with something else, as though wax or <b>stearine</b> had been conveyed into the veins by some subtle process.

60|$|The great ball {{in honour of}} Lord Belpher's coming-of-age was at its height. The {{reporter}} of the Belpher Intelligencer and Farmers' Guide, who {{was present}} in his official capacity, and had been allowed by butler Keggs to take a peep at the scene through a side-door, justly observed in {{his account of the}} proceedings next day that the 'tout ensemble was fairylike', and described the company as 'a galaxy of fair women and brave men'. The floor was crowded with all that was best and noblest in the county; so that a half-brick, hurled at any given moment, must infallibly have spilt blue blood. Peers stepped on the toes of knights; honorables bumped into the spines of baronets. Probably the only titled person in the whole of the surrounding country who was not playing his part in the glittering scene was Lord Marshmoreton; who, on discovering that his private study had been converted into a cloakroom, had retired to bed with a pipe and a copy of Roses Red and Roses White, by Emily Ann Mackintosh (Popgood, Crooly & Co.), which he was to discover--after he was between the sheets, and {{it was too late to}} repair the error--was not, as he had supposed, a treatise on his favourite hobby, but a novel of <b>stearine</b> sentimentality dealing with the adventures of a pure young English girl and an artist named Claude.|$|E
60|$|Even {{as things}} {{stand at the}} present day, however, it is {{wonderful}} how much use we modern Englishmen now make in our own houses of this far Eastern nut, whose very name still bears upon its face the impress of its originally savage origin. From morning to night we never leave off being indebted to it. We wash with it as old brown Windsor or glycerine soap the moment we leave our beds. We walk across our passages on the mats made from its fibre. We sweep our rooms with its brushes, and wipe our feet on it as we enter our doors. As rope, it ties up our trunks and packages; {{in the hands of}} the housemaid it scrubs our floors; or else, woven into coarse cloth, it acts as a covering for bales and furniture sent by rail or steamboat. The confectioner undermines our digestion in early life with coco-nut candy; the cook tempts us later on with coco-nut cake; and Messrs. Huntley and Palmer cordially invite us to complete the ruin with coco-nut biscuits. We anoint our chapped hands with one of its preparations after washing; and grease the wheels of our carriages with another to make them run smoothly. Finally, we use the oil to burn in our reading lamps, and light ourselves at last to bed with <b>stearine</b> candles. Altogether, an amateur census of a single small English cottage results in the startling discovery that it contains twenty-seven distinct articles which owe their origin in one way or another to the coco-nut palm. And yet we affect in our black ingratitude to despise the question of the milk in the coco-nut.|$|E
60|$|The coco-nut, in fact, is {{a subject}} well deserving of the most {{sympathetic}} treatment at the gentle hands of grateful humanity. No other plant is useful to us in so many diverse and remarkable manners. It has been truly said of that friend of man, the domestic pig, that he is all good, {{from the end of}} his snout to the tip of his tail; but even the pig, though he furnishes us with so many necessaries or luxuries--from tooth-brushes to sausages, from ham to lard, from pepsine wine to pork pies--does not nearly approach, in the multiplicity and variety of his virtues, the all-sufficing and world-supplying coco-nut. A Chinese proverb says that there are as many useful properties in the coco-nut palm as there are days in the year; and a Polynesian saying tells us that the man who plants a coco-nut plants meat and drink, hearth and home, vessels and clothing, for himself and his children after him. Like the great Mr. Whiteley, the invaluable palm-tree might modestly advertise itself as a universal provider. The solid part of the nut supplies food almost alone to thousands of people daily, and the milk serves them for drink, thus acting as an efficient filter to the water absorbed by the roots in the most polluted or malarious regions. If you tap the flower stalk you get a sweet juice, which can be boiled down into the peculiar sugar called (in the charming dialect of commerce) jaggery; or it can be fermented into a very nasty spirit known as palm-wine, toddy, or arrack; or it can be mixed with bitter herbs and roots to make that delectable compound 'native beer.' If you squeeze the dry nut you get coco-nut oil, which is as good as lard for frying when fresh, and is 'an excellent substitute for butter at breakfast,' on tropical tables. Under the mysterious name of copra (which most of us have seen with awe described in the market reports as 'firm' or 'weak,' 'receding' or 'steady') it forms the main or only export of many Oceanic islands, and is largely imported into this realm of England, where the thicker portion is called <b>stearine,</b> and used for making sundry candles with fanciful names, while the clear oil is employed for burning in ordinary lamps. In the process of purification, it yields glycerine; and it enters largely into the manufacture of most better-class soaps. The fibre that surrounds the nut makes up the other mysterious article of commerce known as coir, which is twisted into stout ropes, or woven into coco-nut matting and ordinary door-mats. Brushes and brooms are also made of it, and it is used, not always in the most honest fashion, in place of real horse-hair in stuffing cushions. The shell, cut in half, supplies good cups, and is artistically carved by the Polynesians, Japanese, Hindoos, and other benighted heathen, who have not yet learnt the true methods of civilised machine-made shoddy manufacture. The leaves serve as excellent thatch; on the flat blades, prepared like papyrus, the most famous Buddhist manuscripts are written; the long mid-ribs or branches (strictly speaking, the leaf-stalks) answer admirably for rafters, posts, or fencing; the fibrous sheath at the base is a remarkable natural imitation of cloth, employed for strainers, wrappers, and native hats; while the trunk, or stem, passes in carpentry under the name of porcupine wood, and produces beautiful effects as a wonderfully coloured cabinet-makers' material. These are only a few selected instances out of the innumerable uses of the coco-nut palm.|$|E

Only from {{the second half of}} the 19th century onward did Gouda start to profit from an improved economic condition. New companies, such as <b>Stearine</b> Kaarsenfabriek (<b>Stearine</b> Candle Factory) and Machinale Garenspinnerij (Mechanized Yarn Spinnery), acted as the impetus to its economy. In 1855, the railway Gouda-Utrecht began to operate. In the beginning of the 20th century, large-scale development began, extending the city beyond its moats. First the new neighbourhoods Korte Akkeren, Kort Haarlem and Kadebuurt were built, followed by Oosterwei, Bloemendaal, Goverwelle and Westergouwe after World War II.|$|E

50|$|The {{business}} operated until 1882, when it closed, hastened {{perhaps by}} the appearance on nearby Adam Street of the Apollo Soap and <b>Stearine</b> Company, a large interstate competitor. George Wilcox (1838-1917) was managing director of Apollo's Adelaide factory, which {{was taken over by}} Burford's in 1887, with Thomas Mossop (c. 1818-1896) as manager, after an economic recession which closed many businesses.|$|E
50|$|In 1847, Edwin Truman {{introduced}} gutta-percha as {{a material}} for making dental impressions; however, this was unsatisfactory for several reasons, including its tendency to distort upon removal from the patient's mouth, and to shrink upon cooling. In 1856, Stent added several other materials to the gutta-percha, notably <b>stearine,</b> which markedly improved the plasticity {{of the material}} {{as well as its}} stability. He also added talc as an inert filler to give more body to the material, and red colouring.|$|E

5000|$|The Chevreul Cliffs (...) are {{a set of}} cliffs {{rising to}} about 1,500 m {{to the east of}} Mount Dewar in Pioneers Escarpment, Shackleton Range. They were photographed from the air by the U.S. Navy, 1967, and {{surveyed}} by the British Antarctic Survey, 1968-71. In association with the names of pioneers of polar life and travel grouped in this area, They were named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee after Michel Eugene Chevreul, a French chemist whose research on the nature of fats in 1823 led to the invention of <b>stearine</b> candles, used subsequently by polar explorers.|$|E
5000|$|As {{these data}} were similar to the first data {{obtained}} by Chevreul as soon as 1813, the later {{sent a letter to}} the journal Annales de Chimie claiming his priority and contesting the originality of Braconnot's work (Ann Chim 1815, 94, 73).As an application of his laboratory work, it occurred to Braconnot that the [...] "absolute tallow" [...] (similar to <b>stearine)</b> from beef or sheep could be used to make candles. He named that substance [...] "céromimène" [...] (wax-like). With Simonin F, a pharmacist in Nancy, he patented in 1818 a process of candle manufacture. An improved process using stearic acid was patented by Chevreul seven years later.|$|E
50|$|The {{partnership}} was {{dissolved in}} 1877 after Letchford suffered a deterioration in his health, and Tidmarsh ran the business alone. He was in 1880 {{the first to}} introduce <b>stearine</b> candles to South Australia. In March 1881 he sold the business to W. H. Burford conditional on the business continuing to run with no change to the name or product. The new management was not so fastidious about reducing smells where it affected profitability, and drained the lees to the town sewerage. The Adelaide City Council was powerless to force the issue, as the factory pre-dated habitation {{in that part of}} the city, and it was not until a great fire destroyed the complex in 1919 that a move was made to Dry Creek.|$|E

5000|$|In {{both cases}} {{solution}} {{is affected by}} means of pressure steam in the jacketed portion of the kettle. When the solution is substantially clear it is slowly added, a pail at a time (3 gallons) {{by means of a}} 2 quart dipper, to the heated stearic acid as prepared in 1. The oil burner is kept on during this operation {{in order to keep the}} temperature of the mixture fairly constant at 360 degrees F. Care must be exercised in adding this [...] "Saponifying" [...] solution so that excess foaming is prevented. After all the solution has been added the resulting [...] "formula wax" [...] is heated to 400 degrees F. and maintained at this temperature for four hours, at which time a sample is removed, a congealing point determined, (see under [...] "tests"), and any addition made of stearic acid or sodium carbonate solution for correction, and the mixture held without additional heat for 10 hours. It is then heated again to bring the temperature up to 400 degrees F and allowed to cool gradually, usually overnight. When the temperature has again been reduced to 350 degrees F the wax is pumped by means of a Kinney pump into 10 gallon pails from which the wax is poured into shallow pans containing approximately 50 lbs of the wax per pan. After the material has cooled to room temperature it is removed from the pans and stacked. [...] 3. Into a 200-gallon cast iron cauldron heated by and oil burner of the household type, (or as required at present by war conditions, heated by bituminous coal) are placed 500 to 900 labs of [...] "formula wax". Note: The amount of [...] "formula wax" [...] to make up a batch various according to the amount of scrap wax which is to be added to the cauldron. Scrap wax represents commercial wax of which [...] "formula wax" [...] is a part. To the amount of [...] "formula wax placed in the cauldron are added 19½% Paraffin (133 degrees-135 degrees F., usual source Standard Oil of New Jersey) and 2% <b>stearine</b> pitch (M. P. 40 Degrees Centigrade). This mixture, consisting of [...] "formula wax", paraffin and <b>stearine</b> pitch, represents commercial wax. Finally, commercial scrap wax of the composition given above in added until the total weight of the mixture is approximately 1,600 lbs. This mixture is usually heated beginning at 12 midnight and carried through until the temperature is 410-415 degrees F. at 8 a.m. Note; This may be regarded as standard procedure, although at the present time (Dec., 1943) this has been modified so that only Sunday nights is this done. On other days of the week except Saturday the kettles are started at 6 A.M. This method was adopted due to man shortages which necessitated starting the molding operation later in the day.) At this time a congealing point is taken and the necessary adjustments made (see under [...] "tests") after which the mixture is transferred to a closed agitating tank by means of a Kinney pump, the latter forced the hot material through a 2" [...] pipe. [...] 4. To the mixture in the agitation tank there is added 3/10 percent Johns-Manville # 503 Filter Aid. The temperature is maintained at 375 degrees F. by means of a ring gas burner, at the bottom of the tank. At this temperature the wax is supplied by a Worthington pump at 30 lbs to a one square foot Shriver press whose head and follower are steam jacketed and which has 7 sections. The effluent from this press passes through a second Shriver press which has 2 sections of one square foot each. The mixture from the outlet here finally passes though a 1" [...] pipe which has a 100 × 150 mesh Monel, metal screen held in its cross sections by means of a union, into one of four 75 gallon aluminum kettles[...] These kettles are protected by conical hoods to prevent dust particles being carried into the body of the wax. After allowing the wax to remain at 330 degrees F. for three hours it is ready to be poured into the blank moulds. The temperature is maintained by gas burners beneath the kettles and controlled automatically by Partlow Corp. thermostatic controls. [...] 5. By means of a pot with 2 spouts the moulds are filled with molten wax. The pot has a capacity of about five pounds (slightly less than 2 quarts and is specially designed of aluminum and made by Theodore Walter, Newark N.J... The molding table revolves at the rate of 6 blanks per minute, approximately, and the size of the pouring pot spout is only sufficient to permit the hot wax to flow into the molds at a rate slightly faster than the speed of the molds which rotate past a given point around the table. [...] The blanks are extracted at a temperature of 200-205 degrees F. and place on boards which hold 30 blanks. These boards when filled move by gravity down a conveyor. The length of time on the conveyor is about two hours after which time they are sufficiently cool and hard to be put into production boxes holding 63 blanks. The boxes are placed in racks for the following day's production. Into each production box there is placed a semi-finished cylinder, which has been edged and reamed and which conforms to a standard internal diameter at 70 degrees F of 1.826 [...] " [...] at the thin end. The purpose of this is to permit the edging operation to take place on the un-finished blank at any temperature by adjusting the machine to conform to the standard. Thus, in each production box, there is a total of 63 unfinished cylinders. One day's production is held at least 34 hours before further processing. 6. The blanks are first reamed. The reamer consists of a twisted tapered and eight fluted tool. The blanks are forced on the reamer by hand to a stop. The position of the stop is adjusted so that sufficient material will be removed from both ends of the blanks when the blank is edged in the next operation. The reamer revolves at approximately 300 RPM. 7. The edging operation consists in placing a reamed blank on a tapered mandrel and by means of two special cutters working in unison the ends of the blank are formed to conform in couture to a standard template. A second gauge is used to insure proper length (6⅛"). IN each case the edged blank must rest on a tapered mandrel gauge in exactly the same position as the standard blank which is in the production box. The usual procedure is to make the necessary adjustments of the knives of the first blank which is edged so that is conforms to the standard, and then continue the operation on the rest of the blanks in the production box at the identical position of the first blank. Note; since there are 63 blanks for each standard blank it will be observed that every 63rd cylinder is checked mandrel gauge. The accuracy of the method and the facility with which it is done depend on the care and skill of the operator. This is the most critical of all the operations. The edging machine revolves at 2,200 RPM. 8. Following the edging operation is the stamping. This consists in applying a hot printing die to the thick end of the cylinder as it is placed accurately in a vertical position under the die. The heating of the die is done by means of a resistance wire coiled within a hollow torus near the under edge of the circular die. The coiled wire is connected to a source of current and the latter is adjusted by means of a rheostat. The heated died has raised lettering and makes and impression on the end surface of the wax cylinder. The depressed positive lettering on the cylinder is filled with a thick paste of zinc carbonate, the excess of which is brushed or wiped off after drying. [...] 9. The cylinders are next shaved on a ganged shaving machine consisting of a rough shaving knife free from [...] "blinds" [...] and [...] "lines", accurate concentricity and a minimum of taper. These factors depend on the tension of the driving belt, tension upon the rotating mandrel between centers and the position and sharpness of the knives. The speed of the mandrel is around 2,200 RPM. 10. The finished cylinders are placed in boxes which contain 16 pegs and run down a conveyor. At a point on this conveyor the cylinders are held and brushed on the inside to remove wax shavings and dust. [...] 11. Cylinders are inspected, packed and placed in the stock room for a minimum of thirty days before shipping. [...] 12. The reinforcing liners are made as follows: Crinoline cloth of specifications given under [...] "Tests", are cut into a trapezoid (Paper Products Dept.) base length 6¼, altitude 5⅝" [...] top length 5¾". A pack of these are placed in a vise edgewise and thinned glue, one part Le Pages Glue, one part water, brushed onto one slant edge. A liner is then wrapped a tapered mandrel of such size as to fit no too snugly on the molding core. The liner is held on the mandrel by means of two jaws actuated by a foot lever and the lapped edges of the liner glued by means of a gas iron held for an instant along the line of the lap. J.W.

The obtained results facilitate to understand the interaction of the ion water subphase with the Lengmur monolayers of fat acids and lipides, which has a fundamental significance for the biophysics of the biological membranes. The results have the applied importance for the Lengmur technology, deepen the representations about the multicomponent Lengmur monolayersAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|Two yeasts: Cryptococcus uchicensis TMY 9 and Pichia uchicensis TMY 10 and one fungus Verticillium tingalensis TMFMB are {{described}} {{for the first}} time as lipase producer microorganisms. The strains have been isolated after an ecological screening in a palm oil industry. The yeasts- C. uchicensis and Pichia uchicensis - mainly produce extracellular lipases as active as those produced by traditional lipase producing microorganisms. The extracellular lipases are active in the hydrolysis of crude palm oil and its industrial derivatives. Contrarily in the isolated fungus, the lipase mainly remains bonded to biomass. In all cases, greater hydrolytic activities are observed in the hydrolysis of palm olein and super-olein than with saturated substrates as <b>stearine.</b> P. uchicensis lipase shows moderated selectivity versus saturated acid triglycerides compared to substrates with high proportion of oleic acid (olein or superolein). The opposite behavior is observed with C. uchicensis and fungal lipases. P. uchicensis produces a more active crude lipase than C. uchicensis with lower biomass production. The kinetic runs performed with crude yeast lipases suggest a three steps mechanism where the high penetration of lipase in the fat gouts favors the hydrolysis...|$|E

The iodine value of brebra oil was 104.48 gI 2 / 100 gm (within the range, 100 - 120 gI 2 / 100 gm, of DIN) which {{is greater than the}} range of 77 – 94 gI 2 / 100 gm olive oil, 8 – 10 gI 2 / 100 gm coconut oil, 12 – 18 gI 2 / 100 gm palm kernel, 44 – 58 gI 2 / 100 gm palm oil, 85 – 95 palme oleine, 20 – 45 gI 2 / 100 gm palme <b>stearine,</b> 50 – 60 gI 2 / 100 gm tallow, 60 – 70 gI 2 / 100 gm lard, ([URL] 44.4 gI 2 / 100 gm cashew nut oil (Aremu et al. 2006), 38.1 gI 2 / 100 gm citrullus vulgaris (Achinewhu 1990), Hausa melon seed oil (38.50 gI 2 / 100 gm) (Oladimeji et al. 2001) and 84.8 gI 2 / 100 gm refined castor oil (Akpan et al. 2007). One the other hand, the iodine value of this study was lower than the range of 110 – 115, 125 – 135, 125 – 140, and 115 – 124 gI 2 / 100 gm value of rapeseed oil, sunflower oil, soybean oil and corn oil, respectively. The oil in this study is considered drying oil since drying oils have an iodine value above 100 gI 2 / 100 gm (Duel and Tr 1951). The peroxide value of brebra oil was 6.88  mEq/Kg. It was greater than the peroxide value of 3.1  mEq/Kg of cashew nut oil (Aremu et al. 2006).|$|E
