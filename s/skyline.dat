5|$|A park {{entrance}} fee is charged {{at the four}} access points to the drive. <b>Skyline</b> Drive is a two-lane road that has 75 overlooks providing views of the Shenandoah Valley {{to the west and}} the Piedmont to the east. The drive provides access to numerous trails, including the Appalachian Trail, and it is also used for biking and horseback riding. <b>Skyline</b> Drive is the main road through Shenandoah National Park and has access to campgrounds, visitor centers, and resorts such as Skyland Resort and Big Meadows. The scenic drive is particularly popular in the fall for leaf peeping when the leaves are changing colors. <b>Skyline</b> Drive is designated a National Scenic Byway and a National Historic Landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E

40|$|<b>Skylines</b> {{emerged as}} a useful notion in {{database}} queries for selecting representative groups in multivariate data samples for further decision making, multi-objective optimization or data processing, and the k-dominant <b>skylines</b> were naturally introduced to resolve the abundance of <b>skylines</b> when the dimensionality grows or when the coordinates are negatively correlated. We prove in this paper that the expected number of k-dominant <b>skylines</b> is asymptotically zero for large samples when 1 < k< d- 1 under two reasonable (continuous) probability assumptions of the input points, d being the (finite) dimensionality, {{in contrast to the}} asymptotic unboundedness when k=d. In addition to such an asymptotic zero-infinity property, we also establish a sharp threshold phenomenon for the expected (d- 1) -dominant <b>skylines</b> when the dimensionality is allowed to grow with n. Several related issues such as the dominant cycle structures and numerical aspects, are also briefly studied. Comment: 38 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

5|$|Field {{survey for}} the roadway began in January 1931. On July 18 of that year, an {{official}} groundbreaking for <b>Skyline</b> Drive took place. The {{first section of}} the road was to be built from the Rapidan Camp to the Skyland Resort, but would be extended from Swift Run Gap to Thornton Gap. The funds for the first stretch of the drive came from the Federal Drought Relief Administration and employed local farmers and apple pickers who suffered from a severe drought in 1930. In the later part of 1932, Congress approved $1 million (equivalent to $ in ,) in funds to construct <b>Skyline</b> Drive, which would extend from Front Royal to Swift Run Gap. The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was formed in 1933 and would have {{a hand in the}} construction of <b>Skyline</b> Drive. President Franklin D. Roosevelt was impressed with the scenery of the mountains and established the first CCC camps along <b>Skyline</b> Drive. These camps were the first to be placed in a national park. The CCC graded the slopes {{on both sides of the}} roadway, built guardrails and stone walls, constructed overlooks, and planted thousands of trees and shrubs along the parkway. Three different companies were awarded contracts for bituminous surfacing of the road. The section of <b>Skyline</b> Drive between Thornton Gap and Swift Run Gap opened in the middle part of 1934 and cost $1,570,479 (equivalent to $ in ,). This section of the roadway included the Marys Rock Tunnel, a tunnel that was bored through Marys Rock. A tunnel was constructed at this location as opposed to a cut. The tunnel was justified as a money-saving measure but was also suggested to challenge Bureau of Public Roads and National Park Service landscape architects. With the official establishment of Shenandoah National Park in 1935, the CCC hired 300 men, most of whom were not local to the area, to continue to build <b>Skyline</b> Drive. On October 1, 1936, the drive was completed between Front Royal and Thornton Gap at a cost of $1,235,177 (equivalent to $ in ,). The portion of <b>Skyline</b> Drive from Swift Run Gap to Jarman Gap was opened to traffic on August 29, 1939, costing $1,666,528 (equivalent to $ in ,). The road between Jarman Gap and Rockfish Gap was built as part of the Blue Ridge Parkway and was completed on August 11, 1939, at a cost of $358,636 (equivalent to $ in ,). This section of the Blue Ridge Parkway was given to Shenandoah National Park in 1961 and became the southernmost portion of <b>Skyline</b> Drive. The creation of the park and the construction of <b>Skyline</b> Drive resulted in many people losing their homes either voluntarily or forcibly; several homes within the present-day park were razed.|$|E

The roadway comes to the east-facing Thornton Hollow Overlook and heads back to the south, coming to the Beahms Gap Parking on the west side of the road. The drive traverses Pass Mountain as it continues to the south. <b>Skyline</b> Drive comes to an interchange with US 211 at the Thornton Gap Entrance Station, which is located in Thornton Gap to the east of Luray and the west of Sperryville. A ranger station is present at the entrance station.|$|E

5|$|<b>Skyline</b> Drive was {{originally}} lined with miles of chestnut log guardrails. However, the guardrails rotted and were removed in the 1950s and not replaced. The Marys Rock Tunnel was partially lined with concrete in 1958 to prevent icicles {{in the winter}} and water seepage in the summer. In 1983, the Federal Highway Administration began work to replace several of the original stone walls on the drive with concrete walls that used the original stone as a veneer. The road was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 28, 1997. On September 22, 2005, <b>Skyline</b> Drive was designated a National Scenic Byway. <b>Skyline</b> Drive was designated a National Historic Landmark in October 2008 for its pioneering place in the development of national parks in the eastern United States.|$|E

The plain modern and brutalist concrete styles of that period however were contrasted in the late 1990s to 2000s that brought in more prominent residential towers to the <b>skyline</b> with varying colors and architecture themes. The Carlyle residence one block south of the Mississippi River is 41 stories built in art deco style and is the most recent addition to the <b>skyline.</b> Grant Park and Skyscape, though not as tall at 27â€“28 stories, have begun extending the <b>skyline</b> south into the Elliot Park neighborhood.
