After some discussion the doctors decided {{to stop at the}} vicarage of the Rev.Thomas Blackburne, vicar of Eccles, four miles (6.4km) short of Manchester. When told of the decision, Huskisson concurred, saying [...] "Pray do so, I am <b>sure</b> <b>my</b> friend Blackburne will be kind to me", unaware that Blackburne had been invited to the inauguration of the railway and was now waiting {{with the rest of the}} passengers at Parkside.|$|E
500|$|Rituals {{victory was}} {{announced}} at a live ceremony held at Vicar Street, Dublin on 4 March 2009. The prize included a cheque for €10,000, jointly {{provided by the}} Irish Music Rights Organisation (IMRO) and the Irish Recorded Music Association (IRMA), and a specially commissioned award. Frontman Richie Egan joked about a rival nominee by saying: [...] "They all deserve the award -- <b>sure</b> <b>my</b> mother even told me that Mick Flannery (nominated for his album White Lies) was going to win, she said you're good, Richie, but he's gorgeous". The award was decided by a secret ballot after the twelve judges, who included Today FM presenter Ian Dempsey, decided that the decision was proving difficult due to a closeness in voting. Jape was amongst six of the nominees who performed at the event, with a three-song set featuring earlier in proceedings.|$|E

500|$|In 2003, Duncan {{was also}} a member of the USA team that {{recorded}} ten wins and qualified for the 2004 Summer Olympics. He started all the games he played in and averaged team bests of 15.6 ppg, 8.0 rpg, 1.56 bpg, while shooting 60.7 percent from the field. At the Olympics itself, the team lost three games on its way to a bronze medal. The record represented more losses in a single year than in the 68 previous years combined. It was also the first time since NBA professionals became eligible that the U.S. men's basketball team returned home without gold medals at the Olympics. After the tournament, Duncan commented, [...] "I am about 95 percent <b>sure</b> <b>my</b> FIBA career is over. I'll try not to share my experiences with anyone." [...] In total, Duncan was a member of five USA Basketball teams and played in 40 games.|$|E
500|$|A {{focus of}} Tang's {{art is the}} theme of {{national}} and cultural identities, I Was Born Japanese (1995) being an example. Tang notes that he has had four nationalities. He was issued with a Japanese birth certificate as he was born during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore. He became a British national after World War II, a Malaysian citizen when Singapore joined the Federation of Malaysia in 1963, and a Singaporean citizen when Singapore gained full independence in 1965. While living in the UK he was conscious of his Chinese identity, but later on he took the view that he might not be fully Chinese since China had been occupied by the Mongols and Manchurians: [...] "I'm not sure if I'm 100% Chinese blood. I'm <b>sure</b> <b>my</b> ancestor has got mixture of Mongolian and even Thai and Miao people [...] We are all mixed, and this is true. But I always like to think {{that there is only one}} race in the world. We are all one human race." [...] Another of Tang's performances, Jantung Pisang – Heart of a Tree, Heart of a People, centres around the banana tree. He was inspired by the fact that the banana is used widely in Southeast Asia as an offering to bring blessings, but is also feared as it is associated with ghosts and spirits. He also sees banana trees as a reminder of the lack of democracy in certain parts of the world: [...] "Democracy in many Asian countries and Third World countries is as shallow as the roots of a banana tree. We need to deepen [...]" ...|$|E

2500|$|A minor {{controversy}} erupted when Lowell {{admitted to}} having incorporated (and altered) private letters from his ex-wife, Elizabeth Hardwick into poems for The Dolphin. He was particularly criticized for this by his friends Adrienne Rich and Elizabeth Bishop. Bishop presented Lowell with an argument against publishing The Dolphin. In a letter to Lowell regarding The Dolphin, dated March 21, 1972, before he'd published the book, Bishop praised the writing, saying, [...] "Please believe that I think it is wonderful poetry." [...] But then she stated, [...] "I'm <b>sure</b> <b>my</b> point is only too plain ... Lizzie [...] is not dead, etc.--but there is a 'mixture of fact & fiction' , and you have changed [...] letters. That is 'infinite mischief,' I think ... One can use one's life as material--one does anyway--but these letters--aren't you violating a trust? IF you were given permission--IF you hadn't changed them ... etc. But art just isn't worth that much." [...] Adrienne Rich responded to the controversy quite differently. Instead of sending Lowell a private letter on the matter, she publicly criticized Lowell and his books The Dolphin and To Lizzie and Harriet in a review {{that appeared in the}} American Poetry Review and that effectively ended the two poets' long-standing friendship. Rich called the poems [...] "cruel and shallow." ...|$|E

Every believing Christian is, I am <b>sure,</b> <b>my</b> spiritual brother... but if systemically I called {{myself a}} Christian I feel that to most men I should imply {{too much and}} so tell a lie". Of other world {{religions}}, he writes: [...] "All these religions are true for me as Canterbury Cathedral is a true thing and as a Swiss chalet is a true thing. There they are, and they have served a purpose, they have worked. Only they are not true for me to live in them.... They do not work for me". In The Fate of Homo Sapiens, published in 1939, Wells criticised almost all world religions and philosophies, stating [...] "there is no creed, no way of living {{left in the world}} at all, that really meets the needs of the time… When we come to look at them coolly and dispassionately, all the main religions, patriotic, moral and customary systems in which human beings are sheltering today, appear to be in a state of jostling and mutually destructive movement, like the houses and palaces and other buildings of some vast, sprawling city overtaken by a landslide.|$|E
