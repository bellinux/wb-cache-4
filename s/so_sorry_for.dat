25|$|The {{execution}} {{by lethal}} injection began at 10:53pm EDT. In his final words, Davis maintained his innocence, saying:Well, first of all I'd like to address the MacPhail family. I'd like to let you all know, despite the situation – I know {{all of you are}} still convinced that I'm the person that killed your father, your son and your brother, but I am innocent. The incident that happened that night was not my fault. I did not have a gun that night. I did not shoot your family member. But I am <b>so</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> your loss. I really am – sincerely. All I can ask is that each of you look deeper into this case, so that you really will finally see the truth. I ask my family and friends that you all continue to pray, that you all continue to forgive. Continue to fight this fight. For those about to take my life, may God have mercy on all of your souls. God bless you all. He was declared dead at 11:08pm EDT.|$|E

He wrote in his journal seven years after her death: [...] "I heard the mass for my sister [...] Amélia with whom I was so close and feel <b>so</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> never having met." [...] Amélie visited her daughter's tomb every 4 February until her own death, and financed {{the construction of a}} hospital in Funchal called [...] "Princesa D.

Amélie bequeathed her properties in Bavaria to Archduke Maximilian, [...] "whom [...] would [...] happy having as a son-in-law, had God conserved [...] beloved daughter Maria Amélia".|$|E

500|$|Wood spotted Susie Blake in {{a musical}} at the King's Head Theatre and cast her {{in the role of}} the opinionated {{continuity}} announcer. Wood said of her casting at the time, [...] "I didn't think of her particularly for the continuity announcer, but she came in and could do it, just like that. I'd love to cast her in a song-and-dance number – I feel <b>so</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> her always having to wear those terrible blouses". When As Seen On TV ended Blake said [...] "I'm very sad that this is the last time we will all work together but I understand why Vic wanted to stop. Anyway there were only two series of Fawlty Towers and, as far as I'm concerned, this rates with it, so I'm sure it'll be shown lots of times".|$|E
500|$|Bayern {{president}} Franz Beckenbauer recognised {{that it was}} a loss {{of concentration}} in the last few minutes that led to his side's defeat: [...] "That was the cruellest defeat possible because victory was so close. We already had victory in the bag and {{there were only a few}} seconds to go. But those few seconds were enough for Manchester to get back into the game. We were playing well in the last 20 minutes and should have been able to hold on to victory. But in the end, Manchester deservedly won." [...] Manager Ottmar Hitzfeld seemed more stunned by the result in his reaction: [...] "I feel <b>so</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> my team because they were so close to winning this match but they have lost. It's really difficult to digest and this is inconceivable for us but then this is what football is all about. Normally when the opposition equalise you are expecting extra-time and it was a shock to our team when they scored the winner two minutes later. It could take days or even weeks to recover from this but I must say that Manchester are great champions." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Metcalfe, during Mercedes' {{hospitalisation}} and recuperation she [...] "starts {{putting it}} on to get sympathy. She's determined to get what she wants". Metcalfe explained that Mercedes did not [...] "feel guilt at all - she just wants Riley back and she'll {{do whatever it takes}} to get him". Metcalfe believed that it was easy for Mercedes to lie; [...] "hence why she does it so much and so well!" [...] Mercedes felt that she had to lie, and found it easy to cry if she needed to, [...] "especially if it will benefit her". Metcalfe was unsure whether the audience would start to hate her character because she believed that Mercedes was not hateful. She stated, [...] "I hope I've done a good job and people still feel sorry for her". She said that [...] "the viewers have still been feeling some sympathy for Mercedes. I was getting lots of tweets saying, 'I feel <b>so</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> Mercedes, she needs to get back with Riley' and 'Mitzeee is being a bitch'". Metcalfe said that she was surprised by the fans' strong reaction. Hollyoaks executive producer Emma Smithwick also said that Mercedes [...] "gets away with blue murder [...] and yet there's so much love for that character". Smithwick told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that Mercedes would get her comeuppance for framing Mitzeee, saying: [...] "there most definitely will be a comeuppance. With the stabbing, she did it so coolly and lied about it so easily - that can't last forever". Smithwick explained that Mercedes is [...] "driven by her insecurities. She thinks she loves Riley and will do what it takes to win him. That's what it's about...winning. Mitzeee crossed her - she is dispensable but Riley...well, Riley is the prize. Mercedes Fisher usually gets what she wants and men usually fall in line with her. I want to see what happens when they don't..." ...|$|E

2500|$|For {{the third}} {{series of the}} British game show Cluedo, Baker was cast as Professor Plum, a [...] "man {{with a degree in}} suspicion". He was also cast in the 2004 series Strange, as a blind priest who possessed {{knowledge}} of the Devil. Previously, he had appeared as a guest on the quiz show Have I Got News For You and was subsequently described by presenter Angus Deayton as the funniest guest in the series' history. A particular highlight was when Baker gave an anecdotal account of how, while entering a recording studio in Wales, he was accosted {{by a member of the}} public who told Baker: [...] "I will never forgive you, nor will my wife, for what you did to our grammar schools." [...] Baker responded with: [...] "What are you talking about, you daft bugger?" [...] to which the stranger replied: [...] "I'm <b>so</b> <b>sorry.</b> <b>For</b> a moment I thought you were Shirley Williams." ...|$|E
2500|$|Discussing Pete's demise, Gillian Taylforth {{who played}} his ex-wife Kathy Beale, {{has stated that}} {{although}} she and actor Peter Dean had problems [...] "now and then", she found it really hard when he left, and that Pete's death was [...] "an {{end of an era}} for EastEnders." [...] The tankard that Pete was often seen drinking from in pub scenes was allegedly so popular that Peter Dean reported it was stolen twice by fans and he had to replace it on both occasions. Dean has suggested that during his time in the soap, the most letters he received were about a storyline that saw him cross-dressing as part of a practical joke: [...] "The episode I got the most letters about was when Pete was going to a Topsy Turvy party, where men dress as women and women as men. But he didn't get the message that the party was cancelled. He opened the door of the Queen Vic in this dress, singing a song, and then it was the duff, duff, duff ... People felt <b>so</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> Pete about that." ...|$|E
