50|$|Priorities {{for action}} for all {{programs}} are selected {{on the basis}} of the needs as determined on the ground, involving all stakeholders in the design and implementation of activities. In advocacy activities, NPWJ raises awareness and fosters public debate through explicitly political campaigns and the implementation of key programs, such as international and regional meetings, often co-hosted and co-organised with Government of the country in which they are held, fostering partnerships between public institutions, non-governmental organisations and other actors in society, to attain stakeholders’ ownership both of the political drive and of the results. NPWJ also undertakes wide-ranging technical assistance, through the <b>secondment</b> <b>of</b> legal <b>experts</b> to governments for the drafting of legislation and to assist in negotiations on international human rights instruments. Finally, NPWJ has acquired unique field experience in “conflict mapping” and wide-scale documentation of violations of international humanitarian law in areas affected by conflicts and in implementing outreach programs engaging local communities in conflict and post-conflict areas on issues of international criminal justice.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{aimed to}} {{identify}} various aspects <b>of</b> the <b>secondment</b> <b>of</b> Public Sector Employees in Saudi Arabia by proposing {{a policy that}} might help to activate and coordinate the <b>secondment</b> <b>of</b> personnel in Saudi Arabia. To achieve the objectives of this paper, it has been divided into five parts. The first part is the theoretical framework of the issue in which we address the importance <b>of</b> <b>secondment</b> <b>of</b> personnel {{in the public sector}} in Saudi Arabia. Then I will review the concept and importance <b>of</b> the <b>secondment</b> <b>of</b> personnel in general. In the second part we will review several international experiences, while in the third part, we will focus on the current reality <b>of</b> the <b>secondment</b> regulations applied in Saudi Arabia. In the fourth part, we will analyze the current situation by identifying strengths and weaknesses in the <b>secondment</b> regulation <b>of</b> the personnel in Saudi Arabia. Finally, the study will propose a policy to activate, coordinate and encourage the <b>secondment</b> <b>of</b> personnel in Saudi Arabia. It is worth mentioning that the paper concluded that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia devoted a regulation for the <b>secondment</b> <b>of</b> personnel both within and outside Saudi Arabia, through the public sector personnel may be seconded to some government, regional or international bodies. However, within the Kingdom does not allowed to second the public sector personnel except for some government agencies that have special private system and this deprives several government agencies {{to take advantage of the}} unique experiences in some government agencies. In addition, I will suggest new regulations that will allow private sector to second their employees to government agencies. In conclusion there is a need to develop the secondment regulation to allow the <b>secondment</b> <b>of</b> the government agencies personnel among them, regardless of being a ministry or a public institution, as there is an urgent need to add regulatory articles for the secondment to second Saudi employees working in the private sector to various government agencies through the <b>secondment</b> <b>of</b> their services for specific periods such as four years as an example along with providing them with financial incentives to encourage their services secondment...|$|R
