5|$|Azharuddin's first ODI century came {{two years}} after his debut when he made 108 against Sri Lanka. In 1987, he scored a 62-ball century against New Zealand at the Moti Bagh Stadium, Vadodara; the {{performance}} ensured India's victory and he was made {{the man of the}} match. His highest score of 153 not out was achieved in the later part of his career, against Zimbabwe, during which he was involved in a record partnership of 275 with Ajay Jadeja. Azharuddin made <b>scores</b> <b>between</b> 90 and 99 seven times during his ODI career.|$|E
5|$|On February 28, 2011, Watson {{played an}} untelevised {{exhibition}} match of Jeopardy! against {{members of the}} United States House of Representatives. In the first round, Rush D. Holt, Jr. (D-NJ, a former Jeopardy! contestant), who was challenging the computer with Bill Cassidy (R-LA, later Senator from Louisiana), led with Watson in second place. However, combining the <b>scores</b> <b>between</b> all matches, the final score was $40,300 for Watson and $30,000 for the congressional players combined.|$|E
5|$|Timby et al. (2014) also {{assessed}} {{the potential impact}} of MFGM supplementation on cognitive development in term infants. In this double-blind RCT, term infants (<2 months old) were fed until 6 months of age either a control formula (n=64) or an MFGM-supplemented formula (n=71). A breastfed reference group (n=70) was also included. Cognitive assessment done using the BSID-III at 12 months of age showed that the MFGM-fed infants exhibited significantly higher mean cognitive scores than the control group (105.8 vs 101.8; P<0.008), and not significantly different from the breastfed reference group. In contrast, {{there were no significant differences}} in motor domain <b>scores</b> <b>between</b> the three groups, and both experimental and control formula groups scored lower than the reference group in the verbal domain.|$|E

5|$|Hassett {{ended the}} {{first-class}} matches with 1,563 runs at a batting average of 74.22 including seven centuries. Among the Australians, {{he had the}} third highest aggregate behind Bradman and Arthur Morris and the second highest average. His highest score was an unbeaten 200 against the Gentlemen of England. Hassett was less successful in the Tests, scoring 310 runs at 44.28 with one century. This placed him fourth in the Australian aggregates, but only seventh in the averages. His biggest contribution was his 137 in the first innings of the First Test at Trent Bridge. It was a patient innings as England attempted to stop Australia's scoring with defensive leg theory; Hassett helped the tourists set up a first innings lead of 344, which {{laid the foundation for}} the eventual victory. He had three <b>scores</b> <b>between</b> 35 and 50 during the Tests, but was unable to convert his starts into large innings. Hassett took 23 catches on the tour, the most by an Australia excluding wicket-keepers.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} Test {{debut in the}} first match of the Ashes series at Trent Bridge, Nottingham. He took match figures of 2/65, his first wicket being Jack Hobbs, and in his first Test innings as a batsman, he hit the first ball for a {{boundary}} but was dismissed off the next ball, before scoring 49 in the second innings as Australia chased 428 for victory. McCabe and Don Bradman were scoring quickly and had taken the score to 3/229 when McCabe lofted Maurice Tate towards mid-on. Syd Copley, {{a member of the}} ground staff who was acting as a substitute fielder dived forward and took a difficult catch. McCabe's dismissal sparked a collapse of 7/104 as England took a 93-run win. McCabe scored 44 and an unbeaten 25 as Australia squared the series with a seven-wicket triumph in the Second Test at Lords. McCabe made 30 in a rain-affected draw in the Third Test, before scoring four and taking 4/41 in the Fourth Test at Old Trafford, removing Ranjitsinhji, Maurice Leyland, Maurice Tate and Ian Peebles to reduce England to 8/251 in another wash out. With the series locked at 11, the Fifth and final Test at The Oval was a timeless Test. McCabe scored his first Test half-century of 54 as Australia piled on 695 to win by an innings and reclaim the Ashes 21. McCabe took one wicket in the deciding match, bowling leading English batsman Wally Hammond for 13. In all, McCabe scored 210 runs at 35.00 and took eight wickets at 27.62 in the Tests, and aggregated 1012 runs at 32.64 and took 26 wickets at 27.80 for the whole tour. This made him the fifth highest run-scorer for the tour. However, he was unable to register a century on tour, his highest score being 96. He continued his habit of failing to convert his starts into centuries in the tour matches after the start of the Tests. In one stretch of eight county innings, he registered <b>scores</b> <b>between</b> 34 and 79 seven times, and he ended with seven fifties for the tour. Nevertheless, Wisden praised his attacking ability to disrupt the length of opposition bowlers. On two occasions, McCabe took more than two wickets in an innings.|$|E

30|$|In {{the latest}} {{revision}} of FACS 2002 [53], several AUs {{can also be}} evaluated in terms of intensity, using the following levels: A - Trace (classification <b>score</b> <b>between</b> 15 and 30), B - Slight (classification <b>score</b> <b>between</b> 30 and 50), C - Marked and pronounced (classification <b>score</b> <b>between</b> 50 and 75), D - Severe or extreme (classification <b>score</b> <b>between</b> 75 and 85), E - Maximum (classification score over 85), and O - AU is not present (classification score below 15). Because the task of personality trait prediction is a complex one and {{the output of the}} system consists of 16 scores from 1 to 10 for each of the 16 PF traits, {{we need to have a}} scaled input as well instead of a binary one in order to convey all the slight changes in facial muscle activity from each video frame. For this purpose, in our current research, we will analyze only AUs for which intensity levels have been described in the latest FACS revision.|$|R
25|$|The home side won easily at Headingley. The Sabres batted {{first and}} made 209 for 9 in their 45 overs, with four batsmen out with <b>scores</b> <b>between</b> 25 and 40. Former England Under-19 player Tim Bresnan took four for 25 for Yorkshire Phoenix. Yorkshire were always in control, {{thanks to a}} third-wicket {{partnership}} of 84 in 15 overs between Phil Jaques, who scored 84 off 78 balls, and Michael Lumb. Despite two late wickets, Yorkshire finished in style to win by 5 wickets with 32 balls remaining.|$|E
25|$|Returning to Australia for the 195556 home season, {{which was}} purely domestic, Burge played {{in all but}} one of Queensland's eight Shield matches. In 12 innings, he made many starts but could not convert them into big scores. He reached 20 on eight {{occasions}} and converted four of these into <b>scores</b> <b>between</b> 50 and 65, going no further. He ended with 363 runs at 33.00. In the Test trial match, he played for Lindwall's XI against Johnson's XI and made 72 and 46 in a two-wicket win.|$|E
25|$|The ball {{dominated}} the bat {{for most of}} the Test series, with a bowler taking five wickets in an innings on seven occasions (Courtney Walsh twice for West Indies, Andrew Caddick and Craig White twice each and Darren Gough once for England), but only three batsmen scoring centuries (Stewart and Brian Lara in the drawn 3rd Test, and Michael Atherton in the 5th). A hallmark of the series was the inconsistency of the West Indies batting: the team passed 300 runs only twice, and were twice dismissed in the second innings for less than 70 runs. England only passed 300 once, in the 3rd Test, but consistently recorded <b>scores</b> <b>between</b> 150 and 300.|$|E

25|$|Northamptonshire Steelbacks {{failed to}} take full use of their home advantage, and Somerset Sabres escaped with a four-wicket win to reach their first semi-final of the Twenty20 Cup. Northamptonshire's batsmen made quick <b>scores</b> <b>between</b> 20 and 30, but Ian Blackwell's spell mid-match of three for 16 pegged Northamptonshire back to 118 for 6. Ben Phillips then made an unbeaten 27 to lift his team to 154 for 8, however, but he couldn't take a wicket while bowling. Despite three run-outs, Somerset made it through on the {{penultimate}} ball, as Matthew Wood recorded 58 and Blackwell a 16-ball 31 to lay the foundation before Keith Parsons set the pace late on with an unbeaten 38.|$|E
