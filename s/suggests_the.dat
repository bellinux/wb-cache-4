5|$|LACM 149371 is {{a poorly}} {{preserved}} molar-like tooth that largely lacks a recognizable enamel surface and shows many small grooves and holes on the crown surface. This <b>suggests</b> <b>the</b> tooth {{may have been}} chemically degraded, perhaps by acidic water or because it passed through the digestive tract of a predator. The roots are broken off, but remaining pulp cavities suggest the presence of four main roots, which are partially joined into two pairs. A smaller pulp cavity between those roots <b>suggests</b> <b>the</b> likely presence of a fifth root and a slight depression in the tooth may represent another root.|$|E

30|$|The 1 H-NMR {{spectrum}} of compound (1) showed the following characteristic chemical shifts (DMSO as a solvent): the singlet signal at δ[*]=[*] 2.212  ppm <b>suggested</b> <b>the</b> attribution of the protons of the CH 3 group, the singlet signal at δ[*]=[*] 6.029  ppm <b>suggested</b> <b>the</b> attribution of the proton of CH of the isoxazole ring, the multiplet signal at δ[*]=[*] 6.743 to 7.768  ppm <b>suggested</b> <b>the</b> attribution of the protons of two aromatic benzene rings, the singlet signal at δ[*]=[*] 8.764  ppm <b>suggested</b> <b>the</b> attribution of the proton of the CH[*]=[*]N group, the singlet signal at δ[*]=[*] 9.352  ppm <b>suggested</b> <b>the</b> attribution of the proton of the NH group, and the singlet signal at δ[*]=[*] 10.525  ppm <b>suggested</b> <b>the</b> attribution of the proton of the OH group.|$|R
25|$|This {{abridged}} {{version of the}} K-SADS focuses on mania and is a combination/modification of Geller's WASH-U-KSADS and the 4th revision of the KSADS-P (by Joaquim Puig-Antich and Neal Ryan) Specifically, it assess 21 symptoms related to mania, hypomania, and rapid cycling. Each item is rated on a 0-6 rating scale. Scores of 0 suggest no information is available; scores of 1 <b>suggest</b> <b>the</b> symptom is not present at all; scores of 2 <b>suggest</b> <b>the</b> symptom is slightly present; scores of 3 <b>suggest</b> <b>the</b> symptom is mildly severe; scores of 4 <b>suggest</b> <b>the</b> symptom is moderately severe; scores of 5 <b>suggest</b> <b>the</b> symptom is severe; and scores of 6 <b>suggest</b> <b>the</b> symptom is extremely severe. Items with scores of 4 or higher are clinically significant/maladaptive. Trained clinicians or clinical researchers administer the assessment to both {{the child and the}} parent, which each provide their own separate score for each item (P and C), and the total score encompasses the sum of all of the items (S).|$|R

5|$|There are {{different}} theories {{about where the}} ancestors of the Arabian originally lived. Most evidence <b>suggests</b> <b>the</b> proto-Arabian came from the area along {{the northern edge of}} the Fertile Crescent. Another hypothesis <b>suggests</b> <b>the</b> southwestern corner of the Arabian peninsula, in modern-day Yemen, where three now-dry riverbeds indicate good natural pastures existed long ago, perhaps {{as far back as the}} Ice Age. This hypothesis has gained renewed attention following a 2010 discovery of artifacts dated between 6590 and 7250 BCE in Al-Magar, in southwestern Saudi Arabia, that appeared to portray horses.|$|E
5|$|A second {{species of}} Voalavo, eastern voalavo, was named in 2005 from central Madagascar. Morphological {{differences}} between the two are subtle but consistent, and the cytochrome b sequences of the two species differ by about 10%. In mammals, closely related species regularly differ by less than 5% in their cytochrome b sequences, and a divergence of more than 5% within a single species <b>suggests</b> <b>the</b> presence of cryptic species.|$|E

5|$|Adam used several leitmotifs in the ballet. This {{is a short}} musical {{phrase that}} is {{associated}} with a certain character, event, or idea. Adam's leitmotifs are heard several times throughout the ballet. There is a leitmotif associated with Giselle and another with Albrecht. Hilarion's motif marks his every entrance. It <b>suggests</b> <b>the</b> Fate theme in Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.|$|E
5|$|Alastair Hudson, Professor of Equity and Law at Queen Mary, University of London, <b>suggests</b> <b>the</b> {{potential}} for a third class of secret trust. This is where the dying person is encouraged {{not to make a}} will so that his property passes to the next-of-kin, on the agreement that the next-of-kin give effect to his wishes via a secret trust. If this is the case, the next-of-kin would be obliged to hold the property on trust and fulfil the dying person's wishes.|$|E
5|$|Although the comic-book superhero Robin was {{inspired}} by an N. C. Wyeth illustration of Robin Hood, a later version had his mother nicknaming him Robin because he was born {{on the first day}} of spring. His red shirt <b>suggests</b> <b>the</b> bird's red breast.|$|E

5|$|Ancestral {{rhinoceroses}} {{are held}} to have first diverged from other perissodactyls in the Early Eocene. Mitochondrial DNA comparison <b>suggests</b> <b>the</b> ancestors of modern rhinos split from the ancestors of Equidae around 50 million years ago. The extant family, the Rhinocerotidae, {{first appeared in the}} Late Eocene in Eurasia, and the ancestors of the extant rhino species dispersed from Asia beginning in the Miocene.|$|E
5|$|As {{its name}} <b>suggests,</b> <b>the</b> English language, today spoken by {{hundreds}} of millions of people around the world, originated as the language of England, where it remains the principal tongue spoken by 98% of the population. It is an Indo-European language in the Anglo-Frisian branch of the Germanic family. After the Norman conquest, the Old English language was displaced and confined to the lower social classes as Norman French and Latin were used by the aristocracy.|$|E
5|$|As {{the project}} name <b>suggests,</b> <b>the</b> mobile robot is a cobot – a {{collaborative}} robot. During phases of navigation and inspection, a human operator accompanies the robot; {{he can take}} control if necessary, add inspection tasks, note a defect {{that is not in}} the list of robot checks, or validate the results. In the case of pre-flight inspections, the diagnosis of the walk-around is sent to the pilot who decides whether or not to take off.|$|E

5|$|Classification {{into higher}} taxa for these groups {{has been and}} remains problematic. A phylogenetic study <b>suggests</b> <b>the</b> Polyplacophora form a clade with a {{monophyletic}} Aplacophora. Additionally, it suggests a sister taxon relationship exists between the Bivalvia and the Gastropoda. Tentaculita may also be in Mollusca (see Tentaculites).|$|E
5|$|Cognitive externalism is a {{very broad}} {{collection}} of views that <b>suggests</b> <b>the</b> role of the environment, of tools, of development, and {{of the body in}} fleshing out cognition. Embodied cognition, the extended mind, and enactivism are good examples.|$|E
5|$|Consistent {{with this}} perspective, geochemical mapping made from orbit <b>suggests</b> <b>the</b> crust of mostly anorthosite.

5|$|Evidence <b>suggests</b> <b>the</b> {{jet stream}} {{was at least}} partly {{responsible}} for the widespread drought conditions during the 1930s Dust Bowl in the Midwest United States. Normally, the jet stream flows east over the Gulf of Mexico and turns northward pulling up moisture and dumping rain onto the Great Plains. During the Dust Bowl, the jet stream weakened and changed course traveling farther south than normal. This starved the Great Plains and other areas of the Midwest of rainfall, causing extraordinary drought conditions.|$|E
