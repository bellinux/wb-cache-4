50|$|<b>Sulphur</b> <b>hexafluoride</b> (SF6) is used {{primarily}} as an insulation gas. It {{can be found}} in high-voltage switchgear and is used in the production of magnesium.|$|E
50|$|Another {{mechanism}} is sidewall passivation: SiOxFy functional groups (which originate from <b>sulphur</b> <b>hexafluoride</b> and oxygen etch gases) condense on the sidewalls, and {{protect them from}} lateral etching.

50|$|The model {{includes}} {{accounting of}} greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and allows visualising GHG flows on sectoral, regional and global levels. POLES covers fuel combustion-related emissions in all demand sectors, thus covering over half of global GHG emissions. The six Kyoto Protocol GHGs are covered (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, <b>sulphur</b> <b>hexafluoride,</b> hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons).|$|E
50|$|Some organofluorine {{compounds}} pose significant {{risks and}} dangers {{to health and}} the environment. CFCs and HCFCs (hydrochlorofluorocarbon) deplete the ozone layer and are potent greenhouse gases.

50|$|While at the Marine Biological Association and Plymouth Marine Laboratory in the 1980s, he {{developed}} techniques for tracking ocean water bodies using tracers such as <b>sulphur</b> <b>hexafluoride</b> and perfluorodecalin.

He also applied the technology to enable iron fertilization experiments. More than a dozen such experiments have now been carried out and have proved that iron is an essential limiting nutrient in important {{areas of the world}} ocean.|$|E
50|$|The {{international}} community began the long process towards building effective {{international and domestic}} measures to tackle GHG emissions (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydroflurocarbons, perfluorocarbons, <b>sulphur</b> <b>hexafluoride)</b> {{in response to the}} increasing assertions that global warming is happening due to man-made emissions and the uncertainty over its likely consequences. That process began in Rio in 1992, when 160 countries agreed the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The UNFCCC is, as its title suggests, simply a framework; the necessary detail was left to be settled by the Conference of Parties (CoP) to the UNFCCC.|$|E

It would be economy wide, covering all sectors including agriculture. 'Participants' who must account for their emissions will be few and high in the production chain of each sector {{and will have to}} surrender one New Zealand unit (NZU) or one internationally tradable Kyoto-compliant unit for each tonne of emissions. New Zealand units will be capped in number and distributed to participants either by grandparenting (gifting) or auctioning. Sectors would enter the NZ ETS at staggered dates, from January 2008 (forestry) through until January 2013 (agriculture), and have differing allocations of free New Zealand units. In general, participants who can pass on costs of the ETS, such as fuel companies to motorists, would not be allocated free units. While participants whose produce is priced internationally, such as dairy exporters, would be allocated a level of free units.|$|E
50|$|Mica Dam, a {{hydroelectric}} dam {{spanning the}} Columbia River 135 kilometres north of Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada, was built {{as one of}} three Canadian projects {{under the terms of}} the 1964 Columbia River Treaty and is operated by BC Hydro. Completed in 1973 {{under the terms of the}} treaty, the Mica powerhouse had an original generating capacity of 1,805 megawatts (MW). Mica Dam, named after the nearby settlement of Mica Creek and its associated stream, in turn named after the abundance of mica minerals in the area, is one of the largest earthfill dams in the world. The reservoir for the dam is Kinbasket Lake, which was created when the dam was built. Water from the dam flows south directly into Revelstoke Lake, the reservoir for the Revelstoke Dam. Mica Dam is the tallest dam in Canada and second tallest in North America after the Chicoasén Dam in Mexico and it is the farthest upstream dam on the Columbia River. The dam's underground powerhouse was the second largest in the world at the time of its construction, and was the first 500 kV installation of <b>sulphur</b> <b>hexafluoride</b> (SF6) insulated switchgear in the world.|$|E
40|$|The {{perspective}} of facing future Climate Changes due to Global Warming has been stimulating {{the scientific community}} to attend for the need of detecting and monitoring greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere. According to the Fourth IPCC Assessment Report, published in 2007, <b>sulphur</b> <b>hexafluoride</b> and methane are two important greenhouse gases, with a radiative forcing of 0, 52 W/m 2 and 0, 48 W/m 2, respectively. <b>Sulphur</b> <b>hexafluoride</b> (SF 6) is a dielectric and almost non-reactive gas and, for this reason, it is widely employed as an electrical insulator in power distribution equipments, in magnesium industry and also in semiconductor industry. Methane (CH 4) is produced by anaerobic decomposition of organic materials. Its main anthropogenic sources are ruminant breeding, rice agriculture, fossil fuel exploitation, landfills and biomass burning. In order to detect and monitor <b>sulphur</b> <b>hexafluoride</b> and methane, it is necessary {{the development of new}} methodologies and sensitive and selective techniques.

40|$|SUMMARY We {{have used}} intraocular <b>sulphur</b> <b>hexafluoride</b> or liquid {{silicone}} {{as an adjunct}} to vitreous surgery in the treatment of a non-randomised sequential series of 19 eyes with retinal detachment complicated by proliferative vitreoretinopathy. We have studied the surgical results and complications of these two tamponades and drawn preliminary conclusions on their use in retinal reattachment surgery. After a seven-month minimum follow-up 13 (68 %) of the eyes have reattached retinas. Six (60 %) of 10 eyes treated only with silicone have reattached retinas, and four (67 %) of six eyes treated only with <b>sulphur</b> <b>hexafluoride</b> gas tamponade have reattached retinas. An additional three eyes treated initially with silicone oil subsequently developed retinal detachments; all were successfully reattached with <b>sulphur</b> <b>hexafluoride</b> tamponade after silicone oil removal. Intraoperative pneumatic retinal reattachment to assess relief of retinal traction combined with the production of widespread chorioretinal adhesions to wall off persistent anterior traction and detachment, as well as extended postoperative gas tamponade of the retina, appears to enhance the surgical results in retinal detachment complicated by proliferative vitreoretinopathy.

40|$|Bulk age determinations, {{based upon}} {{chlorofluorocarbons}} and <b>sulphur</b> <b>hexafluoride</b> measurements of samples from twenty-one chalk groundwater supplies in southern England, Indicate that waters of relatively recent age predominate In both unconfined and partially confined situations. Water from pumping stations located on chalk below Palaeogene cover {{can be distinguished}} hydrochemically, and a likely interpretation is that these supplies are receiving {{a small proportion of}} recharge via induced via induced leakage. Whilst water which is abstracted from the chalk always involves mixing processes, for a sub-set of confined supplies, ‘piston’ flow could be inferred as a dominant mechanism - resulting in bulk groundwater ages of a few decades. Other supplies are the product of complex mixing. Although low-level chlorofluorocarbon enrichment was encountered for half the catchments sampled, they and <b>sulphur</b> <b>hexafluoride</b> appear to provide independent corroboration to microbiological indicators of the presence of rapid recharge. ...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} 20 years the {{environmental}} tracers chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and <b>sulphur</b> <b>hexafluoride</b> (SF 6) {{have proved to}} be important tools in helping to understand groundwater flow and transport processes, complementing modelling and other established hydrogeological methods.

The limitations on the use of these tracers within the shallow groundwater system are discussed in detail. Limited solubility at higher recharge temperatures reduces the precision of both tracers.

40|$|In 1940 {{attempts}} were made at McGill University to produce samples of pure <b>sulphur</b> <b>hexafluoride</b> {{as part of a}} search for possible toxic respirator penetrants (1). Surprisingly, the samples of supposedly pure hexafluoride, formed by passing fluorine over sulphur, were found to be toxic in small concentrations. Purification and fractionation of the sample resulted in the isolation of a high molecular weight component identical in properties with the compound disulphur decafluoride (S 2 F 10) discovered and described by Denbigh and Whytlaw-Gray in 1934 (2, 3).
