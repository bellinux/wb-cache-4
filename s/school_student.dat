40|$|PROBLEM/CONDITION: Cigarette {{smoking is}} the leading {{preventable}} {{cause of death in}} the United States, accounting for approximately 440, 000 deaths each year. The prevalence of cigarette smoking nationwide among high <b>school</b> <b>students</b> (grades 9 - 12) increased during the 1990 s, peaking during 1996 - 1997, and then declined. Approximately 80 % of tobacco users initiate use before age 18 years. An estimated 6. 4 million children aged < 18 years who are living today will die prematurely as adults because they began to smoke cigarettes during adolescence. The annual health-related economic cost associated with tobacco use exceeds 167 billion dollars. Because of these health and economic consequences, CDC has recommended that states establish and maintain comprehensive tobacco-control programs to reduce tobacco use among youth. REPORTING PERIOD: This report covers data collected during January 2001 -December 2002. DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM: The National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS) and state youth tobacco surveys (YTS) were developed to provide states with data to support the design, implementation, and evaluation of comprehensive tobacco-control programs. NYTS is representative of middle and high <b>school</b> <b>students</b> in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. During spring 2002, a total of 26, 149 <b>students</b> in 246 <b>schools</b> completed NYTS questionnaires. Weighted data for the YTS were achieved by 13 states in 2001 and by 20 states in 2002; state sample sizes varied (range: 982 - 38, 934). This report summarizes data from the 2002 NYTS and the 2001 and 2002 YTS. RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: Findings from the 2002 NYTS indicate that current use of any tobacco product ranged from 13. 3 % among middle <b>school</b> <b>students</b> to 28. 2 % among high <b>school</b> <b>students.</b> Cigarette smoking was the most prevalent form of tobacco use, with 9. 8 % of middle <b>school</b> <b>students</b> and 22. 5 % of high <b>school</b> <b>students</b> reporting that they currently smoke cigarettes. Cigar smoking was the second most prevalent form of tobacco use, with 6. 0 % of middle <b>school</b> <b>students</b> and 11. 6 % of high <b>school</b> <b>students</b> reporting that they currently smoke cigars. Among current cigarette smokers, 41. 8 % of middle <b>school</b> <b>students</b> and 52. 0 % of high <b>school</b> <b>students</b> reported that they usually smoke Marlboro cigarettes. Black middle school and high <b>school</b> <b>students</b> who smoke were more likely to smoke Newport cigarettes than any other brand (58. 3 % and 66. 8 %, respectively). Among middle <b>school</b> <b>students</b> aged < 18 years, 75. 9 % were not asked to show proof of age when they bought or tried to buy cigarettes, and 63. 4 % were not refused purchase because of their age. Among high <b>school</b> <b>students</b> aged < 18 years, 58. 5 % were not asked to show proof of age when they bought or tried to buy cigarettes, and 60. 6 % were not refused purchase because of their age. Nearly half (49. 6 %) of middle <b>school</b> <b>students</b> and 62. 1 % of high <b>school</b> <b>students</b> who smoke reported a desire to stop smoking cigarettes, with 55. 4 % of middle <b>school</b> <b>students</b> and 53. 1 % of high <b>school</b> <b>students</b> reported having made at least one cessation attempt during the 12 months preceding the survey. Among students who have never smoked cigarettes, 21. 3 % of middle <b>school</b> <b>students</b> and 22. 9 % of high <b>school</b> <b>students</b> were susceptible to initiating cigarette smoking in the next year. Exposure to secondhand smoke (i. e., environmental tobacco smoke) was high. During the week before the survey, 1) 88. 3 % of middle <b>school</b> <b>students</b> and 91. 4 % of high <b>school</b> <b>students</b> who currently smoke cigarettes and 47. 1 % of middle <b>school</b> <b>students</b> and 53. 3 % of high <b>school</b> <b>students</b> who have never smoked cigarettes were {{in the same room with}} someone who was smoking cigarettes; 2) 81. 7 % of middle <b>school</b> <b>students</b> and 83. 7 % of high <b>school</b> <b>students</b> who currently smoke cigarettes and 31. 5 % of middle <b>school</b> <b>students</b> and 29. 1 % of high <b>school</b> <b>students</b> who have never smoked cigarettes rode in a car with someone who was smoking cigarettes; and 3) 71. 5 % of middle <b>school</b> <b>students</b> and 57. 5 % of high <b>school</b> <b>students</b> who currently smoke cigarettes and 33. 3 % of middle <b>school</b> <b>students</b> and 29. 9 % of high <b>school</b> <b>students</b> who have never smoked cigarettes lived in a home in which someone else smoked cigarettes. Media and advertising influence was also noted, with 58. 1 % of middle <b>school</b> <b>students</b> and 54. 9 % of high <b>school</b> <b>students</b> who currently use tobacco and 11. 0 % of middle <b>school</b> <b>students</b> and 13. 7 % of high <b>school</b> <b>students</b> who have never used tobacco reporting that they would wear or use an item with a tobacco company name or logo on it. Although 84. 6 % of middle <b>school</b> <b>students</b> and 91. 2 % of high <b>school</b> <b>students</b> had seen or heard antismoking commercials on television or radio, 89. 9 % of middle <b>school</b> <b>students</b> and 91. 3 % of high <b>school</b> <b>students</b> also had seen actors using tobacco on television or in the movies. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS: Health and education officials use YTS and NYTS data to plan, evaluate, and improve national and state programs to prevent and control youth tobacco use. States can use these data in presentations to their state legislators to demonstrate the need for funding comprehensive tobacco-control programs, including tobacco cessation and prevention programs for youth.
