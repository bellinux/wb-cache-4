5|$|While {{the initial}} steer torque and steer angle are both {{opposite}} the desired turn direction, {{this may not}} be the case to maintain a steady-state turn. The sustained steer angle is usually in the same direction as the turn, but may remain opposite to the direction of the turn, especially at high speeds. The sustained steer torque required to maintain that steer angle is usually opposite the turn direction. The actual magnitude and orientation of both the sustained steer angle and sustained steer torque of a particular bike in a particular turn depend on forward <b>speed,</b> <b>bike</b> geometry, tire properties, and combined bike and rider mass distribution. Once in a turn, the radius can only be changed with an appropriate change in lean angle, and this can be accomplished by additional countersteering out of the turn to increase lean and decrease radius, then into the turn to decrease lean and increase radius. To exit the turn, the bike must again countersteer, momentarily steering more into the turn in order to decrease the radius, thus increasing inertial forces, and thereby decreasing the angle of lean.|$|E

5000|$|The beach cruiser bicycle {{entered the}} market in the early 1930s. These heavy single <b>speed</b> <b>bikes</b> {{sporting}} [...] "balloon" [...] tires could handle a variety of mixed terrain including moderately loose flat sandy beaches. Paper boys and couriers favored these bikes since they could handle the occasional gravel road with ease. However, as heavy single <b>speed</b> <b>bikes</b> they were not good for hilly terrain and climbing. These bikes have made a comeback in recent years for their retro look. They are still good flat lander all-rounder bikes, great for cruising the beach or urban landscape. In the late 1970s cruiser bicycles, by then called [...] "clunkers" [...] became the inspiration for mountain bikes. Offering cheap material for experimentation, these clunkers were slowly turned into the modern mountain bike. Wider tires on lighter frames, with multiple gears proved to be a wildly successful combination for mixed terrain and truly rugged single track.|$|R

30|$|Equipped VRUs. First {{implementations}} of VRUs (in {{addition to}} motorcycles) {{will be with}} either beacon type of devices or bidirectional devices. The VRU vehicles expected to be first equipped with devices are vehicles with electric power source, such as e-bikes and high <b>speed</b> <b>bikes,</b> mopeds, and wheelchairs. The use cases are awareness of other road users (i.e. information on presence of VRUs) as well as collision detection, dependent on the vehicle speed and the accuracy offered by the devices. High-end motorcycles and bikes may be equipped with bidirectional devices, for other vehicles beacon type of devices will be used. Specific user groups, such as workers at high-risk areas (e.g. highway maintenance) {{are expected to be}} the first to be equipped with nomadic VRU devices, or with smartphone C-ITS apps. Requirements to be fulfilled are the integration of VRU devices in the vehicle through miniaturisation and a limited power consumption. As the positioning accuracy of the first nomadic devices is expected to be in the order of 2 – 5  m, the main use case is awareness.|$|R
50|$|Many people {{participated in}} the birth of {{mountain}} biking.

Bikes being the preferred mode of transport for the Gang, and steep Redwood slopes surrounding their rendezvous for mischief, {{it was only a matter}} of time before someone pushed his bike uphill and the thrill of riding bikes downhill took over. Others, Charlie Kelly, Gary Fischer Joe Breeze, Marc Vendetti, Otis Guy, and other members of the Velo-Club Tamalpais, built up one <b>speed</b> <b>bikes</b> to give their Italian road racers a rest while running errands, and soon they, too, found themselves riding dirt. Charlie Kelly recounts finding the legendary Repack trail courtesy of exploration with Fred Wolf and Peggy Madigan and soon after, Kelly began promoting races down the famed Repack trail. And while the mountain bike idea formed and took shape, Morrow Dirt Club riders were bombing Cupertino fire roads, just to the south of Marin in the San Francisco Peninsula.|$|R

50|$|As a result, the new TDM 900 {{feels more}} like a street bike {{when it comes down}} to {{pointing}} a line around corners. In particular in fast corners at higher <b>speed</b> the <b>bike</b> shows increased precision in following the riders input through the handlebars, which is transmitted by wider radial tyres on both front and rear YZF-R6 lightweight wheels. On the other hand, the long suspension stroke and setting still ensures a pleasant absorption of bumps, making the bike a first choice for critical surface conditions.|$|R
5000|$|... 2004 was a {{difficult}} year for the team however, with Bayliss only 14th in the standings. Despite (or perhaps due to) its prodigious straight-line <b>speed</b> the <b>bike</b> didn't handle well, with Bayliss often over-riding and crashing frequently, this led to Bayliss' subsequent sacking from the factory Ducati squad, a part of which Bayliss had been for five years previous.

5|$|Steering may be {{supplied}} by a rider or, under certain circumstances, by the bike itself. This self-stability {{is generated by}} a combination of several effects that depend on the geometry, mass distribution, and forward <b>speed</b> of the <b>bike.</b> Tires, suspension, steering damping, and frame flex can also influence it, especially in motorcycles.|$|R
50|$|While track {{bicycles}} {{are always}} single speed, mountain bicycles, road bicycles, cyclo-cross bicycles, and hybrid bicycles {{can be made}} as or changed into a single <b>speed.</b> Mountain <b>bike</b> single <b>speeds</b> designed for trail riding often have a relatively low, or easy and slow, gear ratio. This allows them to climb hills and deal with obstacles and gradients better. This typically requires the rider to be more fit or skilled than the average rider in order to traverse the same terrain. Single speed bicycles designed for road riding typically have higher, or harder and faster, gear ratios.|$|R
