40|$|Electrical {{contact is}} an {{important}} parameter for the reliability of electrical devices. Due to the limitation of optical imaging, methods available for the contact measurement characteristics are only suitable for open or transparent systems. For most of the practical situations that require contact measurement characteristics in non-transparent or enclosed systems, the traditional methods are not effective. Based upon these requirements, a method suitable for the electrical contact characteristics in non-transparent systems is developed by using X-ray computer tomography (CT). The main advantage of this visualisation method {{is the ability to}} acquire three-dimensional (3 D) views of systems keeping the features intact. In this work, the method is demonstrated by measuring the contact area and the average contact angle in each contact spot which is held between the conductors of 16 A AC <b>single</b> <b>pole</b> <b>switch</b> after two different current tests (0 and 16 A AC). The distances between the contact spots are also calculated...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA 3 D contact {{analysis}} and modeling {{suite of tools}} are developed and introduced in this work. The “ 3 D Contact Map” of an electrical contact interface is presented demonstrating the 3 D nature of the contact. It gives information on where the electrical contact spots in a 3 D surface profile are located. An X-ray Computer Tomography (CT) technique is used to collect the 3 D data to a resolution of around 5 μm of a real un-dismantled contact interface for analysis. Previous work by Lalechos and Swingler presented “ 2 D Contact Map” on a 2 D contact profile from collected 3 D data to a resolution of around 8 μm. The main advantages of both 3 D and 2 D mapping techniques focus {{on the fact that}} they are non-destructive and there is no need to dismantle the component of interest. This current work focuses on the 3 D mapping technique showing its advantages over the 2 D mapping technique. For test purposes, a 16 A rated AC <b>single</b> <b>pole</b> <b>switch</b> is scanned after two different current loading tests (0 A and 16 A). A comparison for the total mechanical area of contact, the number of contact spots and the total contact resistance is conducted using both the 2 D and 3 D mapping techniques to a resolution of around 5 μm...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Single</b> <b>pole</b> {{illuminated}} <b>switches</b> derive {{the power}} to energize their in-built illuminating source (usually, a [...] "neon" [...] lamp) from the current passing through the lamp(s) which they control. Such switches work satisfactorily with incandescent lamps, halogen lighting and non-electronic fluorescent fixtures, since the small current required for the switch's illuminating source {{is too small to}} produce any visible light from such devices controlled by the illuminated switch. However, if used to control compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs), the small amount of current required to energize the lighting source within switch also slowly charges the internal input capacitor in the electronic ballast of the CFL until the voltage across it rises {{to the point where it}} produces a brief discharge through the CFL.

40|$|The {{electrical}} contact {{is an important}} phenomenon that should be given into consideration to achieve better performance and long term reliability {{for the design of}} devices. Based upon this importance, the {{electrical contact}} interface has been visualized as a ‘‘ 3 D Contact Map’’ and used in order to investigate the contact asperities. The contact asperities describe the structures above and below the contact spots (the contact spots define the 3 D contact map) to the two conductors which make the contact system. The contact asperities require the discretization of the 3 D microstructures of the contact system into voxels. A contact analysis approach has been developed and introduced in this paper which shows the way to the 3 D visualization of the contact asperities of a given contact system. For the discretization of 3 D microstructure of contact system into voxels, X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) method is used in order to collect the data of a 250 V, 16 A rated AC <b>single</b> <b>pole</b> rocker <b>switch</b> which is used as a contact system for investigation...|$|R

5000|$|With regular generators, an {{automatic}} transfer switch is used to connect emergency power. One side is connected to both the normal power feed and the emergency power feed; {{and the other side}} is connected to the load designated as emergency. If no electricity comes in on the normal side, the transfer switch uses a solenoid to throw a triple <b>pole,</b> <b>single</b> throw <b>switch.</b> This switches the feed from normal to emergency power. The loss of normal power also triggers a battery operated starter system to start the generator, similar to using a car battery to start an engine. Once the transfer switch is switched and the generator starts, the building's emergency power comes back on (after going off when normal power was lost.) ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} a new push-pull-type SPDT (<b>single</b> <b>pole</b> double throw) <b>switch</b> {{actuated}} by {{the combination of}} electromagnetic and electrostatic forces for low power and low voltage operation. The switch is initially actuated by large electromagnetic force to change its state and is held to maintain its state by applying electrostatic force to reduce static power consumption. The electromagnetic force can be easily generated at low voltage. The maximum actuation voltage is below 4. 3 V and the required energy is 15. 4 µJ per switching. It achieves signal isolation of − 54 dB and insertion loss of − 0. 16 dB at 2 GHz, respectively. For 20 GHz operation, isolation and insertion loss were measured as − 36 dB and − 0. 52 dB, respectively. The proposed SPDT switch combines two switching elements in a single structure, simplifying the overall structure and control signals and eliminating mismatches between the two switching elements. The dimension of the switch has been optimized using FEM simulation and analytical calculations. We have successfully carried out a lifetime test over more than 166 million cycles with the maximum actuation voltage below 4. 3 V...|$|R

40|$|Investigation {{into the}} {{limitations}} on the bandwidth of PIN diode switches in their different configurations is performed. The <b>Single</b> <b>Pole</b> Double Throw <b>switch</b> constructed with shunt mounted PIN diodes is shown to be bandlimited due to the line lengths involved in the operation. Series mounted diode switches have a wider bandwidth but the diodes cannot perform as power devices due to their physical construction. Radiation due to discontinuities were found to degrade the isolation but this was overcome by an evanescent waveguide structure. The software program TOUCHSTONE (TM) /RF by EEsof is used extensively as a basic development tool. The characterisation of the PIN diodes which {{was used by the}} software, was carried out. A bias network had to be developed to allow for the biasing of the diodes before any test boards could be fabricated. A literature survey was done on the different types of phase shifters available. A circuit which enables shifts in 45 degree increments was developed. The system consists of Reflection Phase Shifters which are made up of Quadrature Couplers that have different terminations switched in on two of their ports, a Wilkinson power splitter and a power combiner {{in the form of a}} 3 dB Quadrature Coupler.
