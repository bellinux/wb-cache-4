25|$|Besides the quirks the English {{spelling}} {{system has}} inherited from its past, {{there are other}} idiosyncrasies in spelling that make it tricky to learn. English contains, depending on dialect, 24–27 separate consonant phonemes and 13–20 vowels. However, there are only 26 letters in the modern English alphabet, so {{there is not a}} one-to-one correspondence between letters and sounds. Many sounds are spelled using different letters or multiple letters, and for those words whose pronunciation is predictable from the spelling, the sounds denoted by the letters depend on the surrounding letters. For example, the digraph th represents two different sounds (the voiced dental fricative and the voiceless dental fricative) (see Pronunciation of English th), and the voiceless alveolar sibilant can be represented by the letters <b>s</b> <b>and</b> <b>c.</b>|$|E

40|$|This study aims at {{determining}} {{effects of}} temperature and heat flow on crystal structure, surface morphology and material chemical compositions of <b>Cd</b> (Se, <b>S)</b> <b>and</b> <b>Cd</b> (Se, <b>S)</b> formed. Crystal growth {{was done by}} varying the temperature rise and the heat flow. The temperatures of the material used {{in the preparation of}} Cd (Se, S) were 200 °C, 500 °C, and 700 °C. The preparation of Cd (Se, S) material was done in two stages. The first phase was at a temperature of 400 °C and the second one was at a temperature of 400 °C and 600 °C. Crystal as the preparation result was characterized by XRD, SEM and EDAX. XRD characterization was used to determine the crystal structure, SEM to determine the surface morphology and EDAX to determine the chemical and crystal compositions. XRD characterization results indicated that the formed materials of <b>Cd</b> (Se, <b>S)</b> <b>and</b> <b>Cd</b> (Se, <b>S)</b> had hexagonal structure at temperatures of 600 °C - 700 °C with the lattice parameter values for crystal of Cd (Se, <b>S)</b> were – <b>and</b> - while ones of Cd (Se, <b>S)</b> were – <b>and</b> -. Results of SEM characterization showed that crystals of <b>Cd</b> (Se, <b>S)</b> <b>and</b> <b>Cd</b> (Se, <b>S)</b> had been formed with the crystals’ grain size of 10 mm. The EDAX characterization results indicated that the comparison of chemical compositions of Crystal Cd (Se, S) was Cd = 57. 40 %, Se = 26. 03 % <b>and</b> <b>S</b> = 9. 19 %, while for Crystal Cd (Se, S) was Cd = 47. 27 %, Se = 29. 78 % <b>and</b> <b>S</b> = 7. 85 % Keywords : Bridgman method, <b>Cd</b> (Se, <b>S)</b> <b>and</b> <b>Cd</b> (Se, <b>S),</b> solar cells, temperature rise Year : 200...|$|R
2500|$|Originally, Volvo was {{planning}} a different naming scheme. <b>S</b> <b>and</b> <b>C</b> {{were to be}} the same, but [...] "F", standing for [...] "flexibility", was to be used on station wagons. When Volvo introduced the first generation S40 and V40 in 1995, they were announced as the S4 and F4. However, Audi complained that it had inherent rights to the S4 name, since it names its sporty vehicles [...] "S", and the yet to be introduced sport version of the Audi A4 would have the S4 name. Volvo agreed to add a second digit, so the vehicles became the S40 and F40. However, {{that led to a}} complaint from Ferrari, who used the Ferrari F40 name on their legendary sports car. This led to Volvo switching the [...] "F" [...] to [...] "V", for versatile.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Streptococcus mutans {{infection}} {{has been}} identified as an important microbial factor for early childhood caries (ECC). Candida species has been shown to enhance the adherence of S. mutans to the oral biofilm and carious tooth substance. However, there is a paucity of the literature regarding the association between <b>S.</b> mutans <b>and</b> Candida albicans related to the ECC. Aim: To assess and compare the levels of <b>S.</b> mutans <b>and</b> <b>C.</b> albicans among 3 – 5 -year-old preschool children with and without ECC and to determine the association between them. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 30 children with ECC (ECC group) and 30 children without ECC (non-ECC group). Dental caries was assessed, and unstimulated saliva samples were collected. <b>S.</b> mutans <b>and</b> <b>C.</b> albicans counts were determined using Mutans-Sanguis agar and CHROMagar, respectively. Chi-square test and logistic regression were used. Significance levels were set at 5 %. Results: There was a significant difference between ECC group and non-ECC group for S. mutans (P = 0. 04) <b>and</b> <b>C.</b> albicans (P = 0. 02) levels. There was no significant association between <b>S.</b> mutans <b>and</b> <b>C.</b> albicans in ECC and non-ECC groups. Children with ECC {{were more likely to have}} high levels of <b>S.</b> mutans <b>and</b> <b>C.</b> albicans when compared to non-ECC group. Conclusion: Children with ECC presented higher levels of <b>S.</b> mutans <b>and</b> <b>C.</b> albicans compared to children without ECC. High affinity between <b>S.</b> mutans <b>and</b> <b>C.</b> albicans suggests interaction between these diverse species that may mediate cariogenic development...|$|R
