40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{potential}} for annotating and enriching data for low-density languages via the alignment and projection of syntactic structure from parsed data for resource-rich languages such as English. We seek to develop enriched resources for {{a large number of}} the world’s languages, most of which have no <b>significant</b> <b>digital</b> <b>presence.</b> We do this by tapping the body of Web-based linguistic data, most of which exists in small, analyzed chunks embedded in scholarly papers, journal articles, Web pages, and other online documents. By harvesting and enriching these data, we can provide the means for knowledge discovery across the resulting corpus that can lead to building computational resources such as grammars and transfer rules, which, in turn, can be used as bootstraps for building additional tools and resources for the languages represented. 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{potential}} for annotating and enriching data for minority or endangered languages via the alignment and projection of structure from annotated and parsed data for a resource-rich language such as English. The work presented here draws inspiration {{from the work of}} (Yarowksy and Ngai, 2001), who tested the methods for projecting linguistic annotations from one language to another, where the resulting projections could be used to train automated part-of-speech taggers and NP bracketers. However, unlike Yarowsky and Ngai, who sought to develop tools and resources for the 200 + major languages of the world, we seek to develop enriched, searchable resources for a larger number of the world's languages, most of which have no <b>significant</b> <b>digital</b> <b>presence.</b> We do this by tapping into the large body of Web-based linguistic data, most of which exists in small, analyzed chunks embedded in scholarly papers, journal articles, Web pages, and other online documents. By harvesting and enriching these data, we provide an automated means to search for them, facilitating a kind of structure-based, "construction" query. Further, the enriched data can be used to train and develop robust, statistically-based NLP tools, which can be used for the automated annotation and analysis of language data, especially that of resource-poor and computationally underrepresented language...|$|E
40|$|Reflecting on the {{impending}} release of new Head Mounted Display virtual reality (VR) technologies, the article examines definitions and techniques for <b>digital</b> <b>presence,</b> and compares them with research into stage presence. It opens with {{an outline of}} definitions of <b>digital</b> <b>presence,</b> comparing them with Cormac Power’s fictional, auratic, and literal modes of presence in performance. The article then looks at techniques used in VR and on stage to achieve presence. Finally, performance examples that use virtual reality technologies are presented. The article concludes {{that even if the}} technology falls short, discourse on <b>digital</b> <b>presence</b> is useful in providing insights into presence on stage...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{phenomenon}} of ‘Digital Presence’: the sense that Social Network Sites (namely Facebook) constitute the sole means of communicating with the deceased. Previous investigations of <b>Digital</b> <b>Presence</b> have largely been quantitative surveys seeking to document {{the extent of the}} phenomenon; qualitative inquiries have not attempted to determine why certain survivors experience <b>Digital</b> <b>Presence</b> whilst others do not. This thesis is a qualitative inquiry featuring interviews with eight survivors who interact with the profiles of the deceased. It seeks to determine the conditions in which the phenomenon occurs, and to explain <b>Digital</b> <b>Presence</b> with reference to theories and concepts from the field of cognitive neuroscience. It also argues that the phenomenon is contingent upon notions of ‘The Digital’ as a vista which is ontologically distinct from the ‘Physical World’; it concludes that <b>Digital</b> <b>Presence</b> is ultimately the ‘deathstyle’ of a particular, secular worldview, i. e. this worldview’s response to the existential challenge posed by death. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} the core {{issues of the}} introduction of a new PE nexus based on <b>digital</b> <b>presence.</b> It puts forward its essential features and rethinks the foundations of the concept of sourcing for income tax purposes in the global economy. Our proposal of a new PE nexus based on <b>digital</b> <b>presence</b> is also supported by a theoretical reconstruction in the light of a new dimension for the benefit theory. Our work directly relates to Action 1 of the OECD/G 20 BEPS Project. However, {{the development of a new}} PE nexus is in fact not an instrument to counter BEPS, but reflects a structural revision of the criteria for allocating taxing rights on cross-border business income in the era of the digital economy. This paper should be understood as a discussion paper and first proposal to shed further light on (i) whether there is a theoretical justification for a new PE nexus based on <b>digital</b> <b>presence,</b> (ii) how a new PE nexus based on <b>digital</b> <b>presence</b> could be defined and (iii) whether and how potential implementation issues could be resolved. By publishing the present blueprints for a new PE nexus, the authors wish to provoke a more concrete discussion on this particularly important matter.

30|$|It can be {{concluded}} from this research {{that when a}} student begins their studies, they can be digitally unexposed. However, with careful scaffolding throughout their learning, they have many opportunities to gain a positive <b>digital</b> learner <b>presence.</b> Also, {{it was clear that}} some students responded both positively and negatively to different tools. They had to find the tools that suited their learning needs, whereas others found different tools suited their learning presence more appropriately. A variety of research projects were bought together to provide the opportunity for <b>digital</b> learner <b>presence.</b> The themes of the research centred around student engagement, and the impact of student perceptions of their learning, which guided the theme of this paper to present students’ <b>digital</b> <b>presence</b> through blogs, discussion boards, wikis and 3 D virtual worlds.|$|R

This was the premise for creating the Minnesota Intelligent Rural Communities (MIRC) program that the Community Economics field team implemented from 2010 to 2012. Workshops, 1 : 1 technical assistance and educational materials were offered to 18 rural business communities, including to tourism oriented businesses. For two reasons, we examined the <b>digital</b> <b>presence</b> of businesses in the 18 MIRC communities as well as five other control nonparticipating communities. We assessed 13, 931 rural businesses in the 22 communities.

30|$|This {{article has}} drawn from various {{research}} projects, bringing together students’ {{perceptions of their}} <b>digital</b> <b>presence</b> {{from a variety of}} online tools, including blogs, discussion boards, wikis and 3 D virtual worlds. Many of the tools were used in the students learning either as an adjunct to the learning management system or as an added extra for the student’s learning. Students gained a <b>digital</b> <b>presence</b> in many of the online tools used. Their overall feel for the tools varied with responses to discussion boards being very favourable as they felt this was a tool that could assist in their learning. For those who used blogs and wikis, they understood the context in which to use them but did not do so on many occasions of their own accord. For those students who voluntarily participated in the 3 D virtual world activities, they found that the tool supported their learning and they were engaged and immersed in the content when using this tool.|$|R
5000|$|A will, {{often called}} a [...] "Last Will and Testament", {{is a legal}} {{document}} that allows a person to give instructions {{on what to do}} with their possessions once they die. It is also used so that people can declare a legal guardian for their children in the event of their death. In the digital age, people have been wondering what happens to their <b>digital</b> <b>presence</b> once they die. Digital wills are wills that determine the fate of a person’s <b>digital</b> <b>presence</b> once they die. These archives encompass any online account that a person may have such as social media, shopping sites, and gaming sites. Many websites now have a set of guidelines and procedures that can be followed to remove a deceased person’s account from their servers. These procedures may vary from site to site. However, a digital will is a way to determine the fate of your online presence in one location instead of having to make arrangements with each site individually.|$|R

30|$|This {{paper is}} based on {{research}} conducted since 2008 and the academics’ perception of how various ICTs (blogs, discussion boards, wikis and 3 D virtual worlds) {{have had an impact}} in relation to teaching and students’ engagement with their learning and their <b>digital</b> <b>presence.</b> Each student’s <b>digital</b> <b>presence</b> is explored through a variety of e-learning tools used by the students through the learning resources offered. As a regional university in Australia, the University of New England (UNE) has approximately 22, 000 enrolled students with 80 % opting to study online (i.e. off-campus, by distance) (University of New England 2014). In the School of Education, there are usually between 4000 and 5000 students enrolled, with 88 % opting to study online. On-campus students in the School of Education have been declining with less than 12 % choosing to attend on-campus where they would attend lectures, workshops and tutorials (McGarry 2014). The university average is around 82 % online students. The authors, who are experienced in the use of a variety of online resources as teaching and learning tools, provide research results to demonstrate that some of these tools are immersive and engaging for the students’ learning experiences. These tools have provided students with a <b>digital</b> learner <b>presence.</b>|$|R
