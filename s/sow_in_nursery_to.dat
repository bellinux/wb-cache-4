In the present study, the sensitivity of oilseed rape seedlings to post-transplanting zinc (Zn) and phosphorus (P) deficiency was examined in seven field experiments in Hubei province, central China. Oilseed rape was <b>sown</b> <b>in</b> <b>nurseries</b> <b>in</b> late September according to standard farming practice for transplanting at the 4 - 6 leaf stage into mainfields treated with seven Zn levels from 0 - 45 or 0 - 60 kg ZnSO_ 4 ha^ in late October to mid-November. Increase of soil Zn supply resulted in the increase of shoot dry matter of plants at the rosette stage by up to 100 %, at the green bud stage by up to 50 %, and seed yield by up to 18 %. That Zn fertilizers stimulated seed yield even on soils with 0. 84 mg Zn kg^ suggests that Zn uptake by oilseed rape was inefficient. That oilseed rape plants from the rosette stage throught the green bud stage contained more than adequate Zn in their young leaves for growth suggests that the plants were free of Zn deficiency for all but a short period after transplanting. The strong relative responses of oilseed rape to Zn at the rosette stage, and the weakening of the response with time suggests that oilseed rape experienced a temporary Zn deficiency after transplanting which limited final seed yield.

40|$|Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill) {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{commercial}} fruit vegetables of north India. Due to lack of adequate knowledge of seed production practices, the growers are unable to produce quality seed of newly developed varieties. In tomato, pollination and fruit set are highly affected by temperature, thus at low and high temperatures the fruit and seed yields are reduced. It indicates that transplanting date directly affects the seed yield and quality.

40|$|In this thesis, {{animal welfare}} in the pig {{industry}} is investigated {{from an economic}} perspective. More specifically, {{the impact of the}} "Swedish model" on consumers and producer is examined. The "Swedish model" refers to the animal welfare promoting legislations and voluntary certification schemes that was adopted in Swedish pig production from the 1980 's and onwards. The willingness to pay for animal welfare attributes among consumers is investigated in two studies. The attributes analyzed are all related to the "Swedish model" or are practiced experimentally. The consumer's willingness to pay for animal welfare attributes is mostly positive, with a particularly high value for mobile abattoirs and air-partition (fewer pigs per stable section). There is a negative willingness to pay for elimination of castration. Moreover, the heterogeneity of consumer preferences for animal welfare is investigated. Preferences are found to be heterogeneous and the results suggest that consumers' preferences could be divided into different segments. The division into segments is likely to depend on consumers' preferences for animal welfare and food safety issues. Moreover, the economic implications of the "Swedish model" are investigated in a structural equation model. It is found that the Animal Welfare Act of 1988, the ban of using growth promoters and the space requirements for <b>sows</b> <b>in</b> <b>nursery</b> have affected supply of pigs negatively. If these animal welfare regulations had not been adopted the total production would have increased moderately and the retail price of pork would be lower. Hence, the animal welfare regulations of the "Swedish model" have implied increased costs to the pork sector with higher prices and lower production levels...|$|R
40|$|Rice is {{becoming}} increasingly important for Ugandan farm households, both as a cash crop and staple food. Rice production in Uganda increased from about 110, 000 tons in 2000 to about 237, 000 tons in 2014 and the share of rice in total consumption also grew over time. Previous research {{as part of the}} PASIC project, a policy action project funded by the Embassy of the King-dom of the Netherlands in Uganda and led by the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industries and Fisheries (MAAIF) with support of IFPRI, the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), and the Economic Policy Research Centre (EPRC), suggests that a lack of knowledge may be an important constraint to sustainable intensification among rice growers in eastern Uganda. In-deed, rice growing is a complex activity that requires substantial technical and managerial know-how. Successful rice growing involves a range of activities, such as leveling of fields, construction of bunds and canals, <b>sowing</b> <b>in</b> <b>nurseries,</b> transplanting, water and nutrient management, threshing, drying, winnowing, and milling. To get high yields, all of these activities need to be performed according to recommended practices and at particular points in time. In addition, rice growing involves complex inter-temporal decision making, where money and labor invested today needs to be compared to uncertain earnings in the fu-ture. Hence, farmers need to be informed about, for instance, the cost of fertilizer and the expected return to its use on rice, or about the expected benefits of investing time in field preparation.

Seeds of these species were collected and <b>sown</b> <b>in</b> project <b>nurseries.</b> A number of new species were also planted on an experimental basis, including Populus ciliata, an aggressive pioneering colonizer which can survive even under very dry conditions.

Field planting operations were emphasized to improve soil conservation and water harvesting. Formal courses also introduced basic forest <b>nursery</b> practices <b>to</b> motivate participants <b>to</b> establish <b>nurseries</b> for the raising of high-quality tree seedlings. Seeds, polythene bags, hand-tools, etc., were distributed to the 56 participants. In addition to the courses, 18 fellowships were provided by the project, and 43 individuals participated in study toursBased on the project's nursery experiments and demonstrations, it was concluded that the taking of measurements needed to be continued in the poplar sample plots, and the populatume maintained. Manual debudding of unwanted branches in tall poplar seedlings, instead of pruning, would save the plants from insect attack and knot formation, and produce better results. It was recommended that the system of sunken beds and the practice of flood irrigation be replaced with raised beds and sprinkler irrigation.

It was recommended that the Government seek external technical and financial assistance to plan and develop the specialized manpower needed to carry out such a policy. It was further recommended that the means be found to make the heavy investment needed to build up the sector, with community-oriented projects and self-help tree planting programmes.
