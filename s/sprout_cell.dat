40|$|Differential {{expression}} of type I collagen and cellular fibronectin isoforms in endothelial cell variants. Endothelial cells in vivo and in vitro are inherently capable of manifesting {{more than one}} phenotype. Most endothelial cells in culture, even when maintained at confluent density for an extended period, exhibit only the typical polygonal morphology. Other cultures, albeit few, are characterized by rapid formation of variant “sprout” cells once the cobblestone monolayer is established. In vivo studies have revealed <b>sprout</b> <b>cell</b> formation {{to be one of}} the early events in neovascularization. Therefore, elucidation of the factors involved in this process is needed to gain an understanding of the sprouting phenomena. To this end, two morphologically distinct bovine endothelial cell clones derived from a fetal left ventricle were characterized. One culture of cells stably displayed the conventional polygonal phenotype, in contrast to the second culture in which an interconnecting network of sprout cells reproducibly developed beneath the cobblestone monolayer. Analysis of extracellular matrix proteins and RNA transcripts revealed that the sprouting clone showed induction of type I collagen and a shift in fibronectin RNA processing resulting in synthesis of the cellular isoforms. These collagenous and non-collagenous matrix molecules may serve in some manner to affect the processes required during angiogenesis, that is, cell division, cell migration and cell shape change...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{evidence}} indicates that growing blood-vessel sprouts consist of endothelial cells with distinct cell fates and behaviours; however, {{it is not clear}} what signals determine these <b>sprout</b> <b>cell</b> characteristics. Here we show that Notch signalling is necessary to restrict angiogenic cell behaviour to tip cells in developing segmental arteries in the zebrafish embryo. In the absence of the Notch signalling component Rbpsuh (recombining binding protein suppressor of hairless) we observed excessive sprouting of segmental arteries, whereas Notch activation suppresses angiogenesis. Through mosaic analysis we find that cells lacking Rbpsuh preferentially localize to the terminal position in developing sprouts. In contrast, cells in which Notch signalling has been activated are excluded from the tip-cell position. In vivo time-lapse analysis reveals that endothelial tip cells undergo a stereotypical pattern of proliferation and migration during sprouting. In the absence of Notch, nearly all sprouting endothelial cells exhibit tip-cell behaviour, leading to excessive numbers of cells within segmental arteries. Furthermore, we find that flt 4 (fms-related tyrosine kinase 4, also called vegfr 3) is expressed in segmental artery tip cells and becomes ectopically expressed throughout the sprout in the absence of Notch. Loss of flt 4 can partially restore normal endothelial cell number in Rbpsuh-deficient segmental arteries. Finally, loss of the Notch ligand dll 4 (delta-like 4) also leads to an increased number of endothelial cells within segmental arteries. Together, these studies indicate that proper specification of cell identity, position and behaviour in a developing blood-vessel sprout is required for normal angiogenesis, and implicate the Notch signalling pathway in this process...|$|E
40|$|Background: Diabetes is {{associated}} with impaired neovascularization leading to reduced revascularization of ischemic tissue and impaired wound healing. Endothelial progenitor cells in diabetes were previously shown to be numerically reduced and functionally impaired. We hypothesize that diabetes also has a long-term effect on angiogenic cells residing in the vessel wall. To test this hypothesis, angiogenic sprout formation from ex vitro cultured aortic rings isolated from diabetic and non-diabetic BioBreeding (BB) rats was assessed. Methods: Diabetes prone BB (BBDP) rats spontaneously develop autoimmune diabetes were suboptimally treated with insulin by subcutaneous implantation of slow-release insulin-pellets. Neonatally thymectomized BBDP rats, pre-diabetic BBDP rats and diabetes resistant BBDR rats served as non-diabetic controls. After follow-up thoracic aortas were harvested and cultured in vitro in Matrigel to induce sprout formation. Sprout length was quantified after 4, 7, 10 and 14 days of culture. The total number of sprout-derived cells was measured and in vitro proliferative capacity of <b>sprout</b> <b>cells</b> was quantified. Finally, expression of Flk- 1, CD 31 and smooth muscle a-actin on <b>sprout</b> <b>cells</b> was determined. Results: Mean blood glucose levels in diabetics were significantly elevated compared with non-diabetics. Both long-term and short-term diabetes significantly reduced sprout formation (p Conclusions: Diabetes in BB rats impairs angiogenic <b>sprouting</b> from <b>cells</b> residing in the vascular wall, independent of effects on circulating cells or circulating angiogenic/anti-angiogenic factors.

40|$|SummaryTissue {{branching}} morphogenesis {{requires the}} hierarchical organization of <b>sprouting</b> <b>cells</b> into leading “tip” and trailing “stalk” cells [1, 2]. During new blood vessel branching (angiogenesis), endothelial tip <b>cells</b> (TCs) lead <b>sprouting</b> vessels, extend filopodia, and migrate {{in response to}} gradients of the secreted ligand, vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf) [3]. In contrast, adjacent stalk cells (SCs) trail TCs, generate the trunk of new vessels, and critically maintain connectivity with parental vessels. Here, we establish that h 2. 0 -like homeobox- 1 (Hlx 1) determines SC potential, which is critical for angiogenesis during zebrafish development. By combining a novel pharmacological strategy for the manipulation of angiogenic cell behavior in vivo with transcriptomic analyses of <b>sprouting</b> <b>cells,</b> we identify the uniquely sprouting-associated gene, hlx 1. Expression of hlx 1 is almost entirely restricted to <b>sprouting</b> endothelial <b>cells</b> and is excluded from adjacent nonangiogenic cells. Furthermore, Hlx 1 knockdown reveals its essential role in angiogenesis. Importantly, mosaic analyses uncover a cell-autonomous role for Hlx 1 in the maintenance of SC identity in sprouting vessels. Hence, Hlx 1 -mediated maintenance of SC potential regulates angiogenesis, a finding that may have novel implications for sprouting morphogenesis of other tissues...|$|R

Here we find that murine endothelial cells (ECs) of classic white and brown fat depots share ultrastructural characteristics with pericytes, which are pluripotent and can potentially give rise to preadipocytes. Lineage tracing experiments using the VE-cadherin promoter reveal localization of reporter genes in ECs and also in preadipocytes and adipocytes of white and brown fat depots. Furthermore, capillary sprouts from human adipose tissue, which have predominantly EC characteristics, are found to express Zfp 423, a recently identified marker of preadipocyte determination. In response to PPAR gamma activation, endothelial characteristics of <b>sprouting</b> <b>cells</b> are progressively lost, and cells form structurally and biochemically defined adipocytes. Together these data support an endothelial origin of murine and human adipocytes, suggesting a model for how adipogenesis and angiogenesis are coordinated during adipose tissue expansion...|$|R

Using AnxA 1 -KO mice, {{we show that}} tumor growth and metastasis are significantly decreased, whereas rodent survival and tumor necrosis are greatly increased when tumors grow in AnxA 1 -KO mice. Systems analysis of gene expression in these tumors specifically implicates 2 related vascular functions, angiogenesis and wound healing, in this impairment. Both tumor vascular development and wound healing are greatly retarded in KO tissues. Aortic ring assays reveal induced AnxA 1 expression on <b>sprouting</b> endothelial <b>cells</b> of normal mice whereas KO aortas exhibit impaired endothelial <b>cell</b> <b>sprouting</b> that is rescued by adenoviral expression of AnxA 1. Key differences in specific gene regulation may define new molecular pathways mediating angiogenesis, including a reset profile of pro- versus anti-angiogenic factors, apparently distinct for physiological versus pathological angiogenesis.

40|$|Angiogenesis is the {{sprouting}} of {{new blood}} vessels from pre-existing vessels initiated from vascular endothelial cells {{in response to}} exogenous chemical signals.

40|$|AbstractWe {{studied the}} early pattern of neural tube (NT) vascularization in quail embryos and chick–quail chimeras. Angioblasts {{appeared}} {{first in the}} dorsal third at Hamburger and Hamilton (HH) stage 19 as single, migrating cells. Their distribution did not correspond to a segmental pattern. After this initial dorsal immigration, endothelial sprouts invaded the NT {{on either side of}} the floor plate (HH stage 21). These cells remained continuous with their arterial vascular sources, connected to the venous perineural vascular plexus at HH-stage 22, and formed the first perfused vessels of the NT at HH-stage 23. The same pattern of angiotrophic vascularization was observed in a craniocaudal sequence starting caudal to the rhombencephalic NT. Extremely long filopodia were observed on <b>sprouting</b> <b>cells,</b> extending toward the central canal and the mantle layer. The exclusively extraneuroectodermal origin of angioblastic cells was demonstrated with chick–quail chimeras. Following replacement of quail NT by chick NT graft, angioblast and sprout distribution in chimeras was the same as in controls. We conclude that the NT receives its first blood vessels by a combination of two different processes, dorsal immigration of isolated migrating angioblastic <b>cells</b> and ventral <b>sprouting</b> of endothelial <b>cells,</b> which derive from perfused vessels. The dorsal invasive angioblasts contribute to the developing intraneural vascular plexus after having traversed the neural tube. The initial distribution of blood vessels within the neuroepithelium corresponds to intrinsic random motility of angioblastic cells; a more regular pattern is seen later. The floor plate apparently prohibits connections between sprouts in both NT sides, whereas in the dorsal NT, such a separating effect on the migrating angioblasts does not exist...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDuring angiogenic <b>sprouting,</b> endothelial tip <b>cells</b> {{emerge from}} {{existing}} vessels {{in a process}} that requires vascular basement membrane degradation. Here, we show that F-actin/cortactin/P-Src-based matrix-degrading microdomains called podosomes contribute to this step. In vitro, VEGF-A/Notch signaling regulates the formation of functional podosomes in endothelial cells. Using a retinal neovascularization model, we demonstrate that tip cells assemble podosomes during physiological angiogenesis in vivo. In the retina, podosomes are also part of an interconnected network that surrounds large microvessels and impinges on the underlying basement membrane. Consistently, collagen-IV is scarce in podosome areas. Moreover, Notch inhibition exacerbates podosome formation and collagen-IV loss. We propose that the localized proteolytic action of podosomes on basement membrane collagen-IV facilitates endothelial <b>cell</b> <b>sprouting</b> and anastomosis within the developing vasculature. The identification of podosomes as key components of the sprouting machinery provides another opportunity to target angiogenesis therapeutically...|$|R

Our laboratory has previously identified MMP 2 as a key regulator of lymphangiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. However, the exact function of MMP 2 in this process is yet unknown. The present work aims at elucidating the mechanisms of MMP 2 action during lymphangiogenesis. MMP 2 could either act as a growth factor activator or as a regulator of matrix remodeling. To address this question, we studied the effect of MMP 2 on lymphangiogenesis in an novel in vitro model of <b>sprouting</b> <b>cells</b> from small aggregates (spheroids) seeded in a collagen gel. In this model, quantification of the lymphangiogenic response is performed through computerized methods allowing the measurement of the distance of migration, but also the evaluation of how the cell are migrating.

The importance of extracellular matrix composition is evaluated by embedding these spheroids into different matrices (matrigel versus collagen; pepsinized collagen versus native collagen; different collagen concentrations). Our results reveal a modification of cell migration through collagen gel after MMP 2 inhibition. The utilization of DQ collagen and microscopy refractance confirmed the importance of MMP 2 collagenoyitic activity for lymphangiogenesis. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} of {{morphogenesis}} in D. uninucleata, growth was followed on semi-solid and liquid media. The ellipsoid ascospores germinated to form a branched septate mycelium, which is fragmented in shake culture. Sexual reproduction began when the sprout had 4 - 5 cells. The first ascus was initiated by the formation of isogametxvia between the <b>sprout</b> mother <b>cell</b> and the distal adjacent cell, these fused at their tips and formed an ascus. The ascus grew in size and formed multispored uninucleate ascospores on maturation. The pattern of ascus insertion in the sprout was predictable. Each ascus at initiation was 2 cells away from the adjacent proximal ascus and 3 [...] 5 cells behind the distal hyphal tip. Ascus insertion was governed by the metabolic level in the cells. The external nutrient gradient was not involved as the pattern was {{the same in the}} batch culture and in cultures on semi-solid media. The ascus unit is supported by 2 cells. The proximal poles of the <b>sprout</b> <b>cells</b> are more active in forming gametangia than the distal poles. 40 - 60 % of the attempts to form asci fail due to only single gametangia being produced or two gametangia failing to fuse. A thick capsule was formed during the swelling phase of ascospore germination. It consists of microfibrils embedded in an amorphous matrix. In a search for morphological mutants no capsuleless mutant was found after treatment with UV or NTG. One sterile mutant was isolated with larger cells and larger nuclei than the wild type and was possibly a polyploid. Attempts to improve the synchrony of germinating ascospores and growing cells using hydroxyurea were unsuccessful. Using different carbon sources and different levels, vegetative growth and sexual reproduction were equally affected, irrespective of the rate of growth. Sprouts reproduced normally on reaching the 4 - 5 cell stage. Inhibitors of nucleic acid, protein synthesis, TGA cycle and metal chelating agents were added to the cultures at different stages of growth and showed that inhibition of growth could be achieved but at concentrations much higher than was shown in other fungi. If vegetative growth was inhibited ascus formation was equally inhibited. Exogenous cAMP increased the percentage of successful attempts to produce asci and decreased the time required for the culture to reach maturity. High temperature of 35 °C increased the percentage of gametangial fusion failure and had no effect on other steps of ascus formation or the vegetative growth. <p...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Pathological {{angiogenesis}} of {{the retina}} {{is a key}} component of irreversible causes of blindness. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a major inducer of retinal neovascularization and VEGF blockers have evolved over time. However, limitations to anti-VEGF therapies may exist and novel anti-angiogenic approaches are eagerly required. During the neovascularization process the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) /uPA receptor (uPAR) system sustains the proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix by <b>sprouting</b> endothelial <b>cells.</b> Here we studied the anti-angiogenic activity of Ac-L-Arg-Aib-L-Arg-D-Cα(Me) Phe-NH 2 (UPARANT), a modified peptide derived from uPAR and able to interfere with uPAR/integrin interaction. Methods: The anti-angiogenic potential of UPARANT was assessed in various angiogenesis assays on endothelia of different species and tissue origin, including VEGF-stimulated endothelial <b>cell</b> <b>sprouting</b> from human umbilical venous endothelial cell (HUVEC) spheroids and murine aortic ring or retina fragments, VEGF-induced neovessel formation in the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) and rabbit cornea, and pathological vascularization in a murine model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR). Results: When administered at picomolar concentrations, UPARANT prevents the invasion of a 3 D fibrin gel by spheroids of HUVECs stimulated by VEGF. This occurred {{in the absence of a}} significant effect of UPARANT on HUVEC proliferation. In keeping with these in vitro findings, UPARANT caused a dose-dependent inhibition of endothelial <b>cell</b> <b>sprouting</b> on murine aortic rings and retina fragments embedded in 3 D fibrin gels in the presence of VEGF as a pro-angiogenic stimulus. Furthermore, UPARANT caused a significant inhibition of VEGF-induced angiogenesis in the chick embryo CAM assay with no effect on embryonic development and survival. UPARANT exerted a significant anti-angiogenic activity also in vivo by topic administration in a rabbit cornea assay and by intravitreal injection in a murine model of OIR. Conclusions: Taken together, these data indicate that UPARANT may represent a promising therapeutic agent for angiogenesis-dependent diseases, including pathological angiogenesis of the retina.

METHODS: Tubelike structure formation and the development of secondary sprouts on a basement membrane (BM) matrix, cell proliferation, and cell migration were studied in cultures of bovine and human RECs. Specific inhibitors were tested for inhibition of retinal neovascularization in a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR). RESULTS: In initial experiments, the broad-spectrum protein kinase inhibitors, H 7 and H 89, stabilized REC tubes on BM matrix and inhibited secondary <b>sprouting,</b> <b>cell</b> migration, and cell proliferation. Among more specific kinase inhibitors tested, only inhibitors of protein kinase CK 2 (formerly, casein kinase II), such as emodin and DRB, were able to duplicate the effects of H 7 and H 89. Actinomycin D caused only minor changes in angiogenic assays, suggesting that CK 2 's effects on REC did not involve its known impact on transcription. The extent of retinal neovascularization in a mouse OIR model was reduced > 70 % (versus untreated or vehicle-treated groups) after treatment with emodin (6 days at 60 mg/kg per day) and by approximately 60 % after treatment at the same dose with TBB, the most specific CK 2 inhibitor known. In the treated retinas, the main vascular tree had minimal changes, but the neovascular tufts were greatly reduced in number or absent.

Here we aim to elucidate whether mTOR inhibition has antiepileptogenic and/or antiseizure effects using different treatment strategies in the electrogenic post-status epilepticus (SE) rat model. METHODS: Effects of mTOR inhibitor rapamycin were tested using the following three treatment protocols: (1) "stop-treatment"-post-SE treatment (6 mg/kg/day) was discontinued after 3 weeks; rats were monitored for 5 more weeks thereafter, (2) "pretreatment"-rapamycin (3 mg/kg/day) was applied during 3 days preceding SE; and (3) "chronic phase-treatment"- 5 days rapamycin treatment (3 mg/kg/day) in the chronic phase. We also tested curcumin, an alternative mTOR inhibitor with antiinflammatory and antioxidant effects, using chronic phase treatment. Seizures were continuously monitored using video-electroencephalography (EEG) recordings; mossy fiber <b>sprouting,</b> <b>cell</b> death, and inflammation were studied using immunohistochemistry. Blood was withdrawn regularly to assess rapamycin and curcumin levels with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). RESULTS: Stop-treatment led to a strong reduction of seizures during the 3 -week treatment and a gradual reappearance of seizures during the following 5 weeks. Three days pretreatment did not prevent seizure development, whereas 5 -day rapamycin treatment in the chronic phase reduced seizure frequency. Washout of rapamycin was slow and associated with a gradual reappearance of seizures. Rapamycin treatment (both 3 and 6 mg/kg) led to body growth reduction. Curcumin treatment did not reduce seizure frequency or lead to a decrease in body weight.

In this study, we demonstrate a novel and critical role for the small GTPase, RhoB, in vascular development. RhoB null mice have retarded vascular development in the retina characterized by altered sprout morphology. Moreover, pharmaceutical means to deplete RhoB in neonatal rats is associated with apoptosis in the <b>sprouting</b> endothelial <b>cells</b> of newly forming vessels. Similarly, acute depletion of RhoB by antisense or dominant-negative strategies in primary endothelial cell culture models led to apoptosis and failures in tube formation. We identified a novel link between RhoB and the Akt survival signaling pathway to explain these changes. Confocal microscopy revealed that RhoB is highly localized to the nuclear margin with a small percentage found inside the nucleus. Similarly, total Akt is throughout the cell but has increased accumulation at the nuclear margin, and active phosphorylated Akt is found primarily inside the nucleoplasm, where it partially colocalizes with the RhoB therein. We show that this colocalization is functionally relevant, because when RhoB was depleted, Akt was excluded from the nucleus and total cellular Akt protein was decreased in a proteosome-dependent manner. Because the function of RhoB in vivo appears to only be rate limiting for endothelial <b>cell</b> <b>sprouting,</b> we propose that RhoB has a novel stage-specific function to regulate endothelial cell survival during vascular development.

Using a combination of high-resolution in vivo imaging of zebrafish vascular development and a human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) in vitro cell culture system, we observed that loss of PLK 2 function resulted in a reduction in endothelial <b>cell</b> <b>sprouting</b> and migration, whereas overexpression of PLK 2 promoted angiogenesis.

40|$|Over-expression of matrilysin (MMP- 7) is {{predominantly}} associated with epithelial (pre) malignant cells. In {{the present study}} MMP- 7 expression {{is also found in}} endothelial cells in various human cancer types. Endothelial MMP- 7 was associated with CD 34 and/or CD 105 expression. These immunohistochemical data were confirmed by RT-PCR on VEGF-stimulated endothelial cells. In addition, MMP- 7 was also identified in <b>sprouting</b> endothelial <b>cells</b> in vitro. The potential clinical relevance of endothelial MMP- 7 was assessed for cervical cancer patients by evaluating the association with overall survival. In contrast to MMP- 7 in malignant epithelial cells, MMP- 7 expression in endothelial cells showed a significant association with poor survival (LR 5. 12, P = 0. 02, n = 30). Our data suggest that MMP- 7 is involved in tumor angiogenesis, thereby contributing to malignant growth and hence associated with decreased survival. © 2007 International Society of Matrix Biology...|$|R
40|$|The {{expression}} of integrin αvβ 3 on <b>sprouting</b> capillary <b>cells</b> and their interaction with specific extracellular matrix ligands {{play a key}} role in tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. In several malignancies, tumor {{expression of}} integrin αvβ 3 correlates well with tumor progression. Non-invasive imaging methods to visualize and quantify integrin αvβ 3 expression in vivo are crucial for the success of anti-angiogenic therapy targeting integrin. Suitably labeled RGD peptides (potent integrin αvβ 3 antagonists) and antibodies have been developed for PET, SPECT and NIR fluorescence imaging of small animals. Due to the high sensitivity and adequate spatial and temporal resolution of PET, development of PET probes for integrin expression imaging has been the mainstay of active research. We improved the tumor targeting efficacy and in vivo pharmacokinetics by applying polyvalency effect and 18 64 designed F- and Cu-labeled dimeric and multimeric RGD peptides for both imaging and imaging-guided internal radiotherapy applications. 1...|$|R

40|$|Angiogenesis, or the {{formation}} of new blood vessels from preexisting ones, is essential to establish the vascular circuit during embryonic development. During angiogenic <b>sprouting,</b> endothelial <b>cells</b> exhibit a diverse array of cellular behaviors. Endothelial tip cells must migrate extensively and proliferate in response to proangiogenic cues while trailing cells need to maintain their position and connection to the patent vasculature, despite exposure to the same proangiogenic molecules. Several new studies have now {{shed light on the}} underlying mechanisms that are responsible for coordinating this process. In particular, this work has identified a conserved role for the Notch signalling pathway in limiting the cellular angiogenic response, in part by reducing the level of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors in endothelial cells. In this overview, we discuss the emerging concepts elucidated by these studies and propose a model in which Notch acts reiteratively throughout the angiogenic process, likely by acting as a switch to determine a cell's response to Vegf...|$|R
40|$|Angiogenesis {{is crucial}} during many {{physiological}} processes, and {{is influenced by}} various biochemical and biomechanical factors. Models have proven useful in understanding the mechanisms of angiogenesis and {{the characteristics of the}} capillaries formed as part of the process. We have developed a 3 D hybrid, agent-field model where individual cells are modeled as sprout-forming agents in a matrix field. Cell independence, cell-cell communication and stochastic cell response are integral parts of the model. The model simulations incorporate probabilities of an individual cell to transition into one of four states - quiescence, proliferation, migration and apoptosis. We demonstrate that several features such as continuous <b>sprouts,</b> <b>cell</b> clustering and branching that are observed in microfluidic experiments conducted under controlled conditions using few angiogenic factors can be reproduced by this model. We also identify the transition probabilities that result in specific sprout characteristics such as the length and number of continuous sprouts. We have used microfluidics to study cell migration and capillary morphogenesis. The experiments were conducted under different concentrations of VEGF and Ang I. We demonstrated that capillaries with distinct characteristics can be grown under different media conditions and that characteristics can be altered by changing these conditions. A two-channel microfluidic device fabricated in PDMS was used for all experiments. The rationale underlying the design of the experiments was twofold: the first goal was to generate reproducible and physiologically relevant results in a microfluidic device, and the second goal was to quantify the capillary characteristics and use them to estimate the transition parameters of the model. We developed stable, well-maintained sprouts by using human microvascular endothelial cells in 2. 5 mg/ml dense collagen I gel and by using media supplemented with 40 ng/ml VEGF and 500 ng/ml Ang 1 for two days. It has been shown in many studies that VEGF acts as an angiogenic factor and Ang 1 acts as stabilizing factor. Here we showed that their roles are maintained in the 3 D microenvironment, and the sprout characteristics obtained by using this baseline condition could be altered by changing the concentrations of these two growth factors in a systematic way. <b>Sprout</b> and <b>cell</b> characteristics obtained in the experiments and simulations were analyzed by adapting Decision Tree Analysis. This methodology provides us with a useful tool for discerning the impact of different growth factors on the process of cell migration or proliferation as they alter general sprout morphology. The imprints obtained via experiments and simulations were compared; by choosing appropriate values of the transition probabilities, the model generates capillary characteristics similar to those seen in experiments (R 2 ~ 0. 82 - 0. 99). Thus, this model can be used to cluster sprout morphology as a function of various influencing factors and, within bounds, predict if a certain growth factor will affect migration or proliferation as it impacts sprout morphology. This was demonstrated in the case of anti-angiogenic agent, PF 4. We showed that at high concentration of PF 4 (- 1000 ng/ ml), the transition to migration is more profoundly affected while at low concentrations of - 10 ng/ ml, PF 4 does not have much of an effect on either migration or proliferation. by Anusuya Das.

40|$|The angiostatic {{nature of}} {{pharmacological}} doses of glucocorticoid steroids is well known. However, {{the consequences of}} pathophysiological elevation of endogenous glucocorticoids are not well established. In the current study, we hypothesized that the angiostatic effect of corticosterone, an endogenous glucocorticoid in rodents, occurs through multi-faceted alterations in skeletal muscle microvascular endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and proteolysis. Chronic corticosterone treatment significantly reduced the capillary to fiber ratio in the tibialis anterior muscle {{compared to that of}} placebo-treated rats. Corticosterone inhibited endothelial <b>cell</b> <b>sprouting</b> from capillary segments ex vivo. Similarly, 3 -dimensional endothelial cell spheroids treated with corticosterone for 48 hours showed evidence of sprout regression and reduced <b>sprout</b> length. Endothelial <b>cell</b> proliferation was reduced in corticosterone treated cells, coinciding with elevated FoxO 1 and reduced VEGF production. Corticosterone treated endothelial cells exhibited reduced migration, which correlated with a reduction in RhoA activity. Furthermore, corticosterone treated endothelial cells in both 3 -dimensional and monolayer cultures had decreased MMP- 2 production and activation resulting in decreased proteolysis by endothelial cells, limiting their angiogenic potential. Promoter assays revealed that corticosterone treatment transcriptionally repressed MMP- 2, which may map to a predicted GRE between - 1510 and - 1386 bp of the MMP- 2 promoter. Additionally, Sp 1, a known transcriptional activator of MMP- 2 was decreased following corticosterone treatment. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms by which pathophysiological levels of endogenous glucocorticoids may exert angiostatic effects...|$|R
30|$|Angiogenesis is {{the most}} common process of new blood vessel development. Growth of new vessels starts from {{pre-existing}} ones and consists of two main processes: <b>sprouting</b> (endothelial <b>cell</b> migration) and intussusception (splitting of vessels) [1, 2]. The growth of blood vessels depends on a balance between angiogenesis-promoting and angiogenesis-inhibiting signalling molecules. Vascular network growth is an essential process, especially during embryonic development, tissue remodelling and regeneration. However, disorders in blood vessel development may foster diseases like chronic inflammatory disorders. Development of new vessels is also essential for the growth and metastasis of tumours, in which pro-angiogenic molecules like vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) play critical roles. Binding of FGF and especially VEGF, which is considered a major molecule controlling blood vessel morphogenesis, to their tyrosine kinase receptors activates multiple downstream molecules involved in different signalling pathways that lead to increased vascular permeability, cell migration and proliferation [3]. The VEGF receptor KDR (also called Flk- 1) and the FGF receptor FGFR are responsible for regulating angiogenesis (for reviews, see [4, 5]).|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} to incorporating information from heterogeneous images of migrating cells in 3 D gel. We study 3 D angiogenic <b>sprouting,</b> where <b>cells</b> burrow into the gel matrix, communicate with other cells and create vascular networks. We combine time-lapse fluorescent images of stained cell nuclei and transmitted light images of the background gel to track cell trajectories. The nuclei images are sampled less frequently due to photo toxicity. Hence, 3 D cell tracking can be performed more reliably when 2 D sprout profiles, extracted from gel matrix images, are effectively incorporated. We employ a Bayesian filtering approach to optimally combine the two heterogeneous images with different sampling rates. We construct stochastic models to predict <b>cell</b> locations and <b>sprout</b> profiles and condition the likelihood of nuclei location by the sprout profile. The conditional distribution is non-Gaussian and the cell dynamics is non-linear. To jointly update <b>cell</b> and <b>sprout</b> estimates, we use a Rao-Blackwell particle filter. Simulation and experimental results show accurate tracking of multiple <b>cells</b> along with <b>sprout</b> formation, demonstrating synergistic effects of incorporating the two types of images...|$|R
