5|$|Led by Donald Bradman, Australia had {{proceeded}} {{through the}} first two months of their 1948 England tour undefeated. After winning 10 of the 12 games before the Tests, eight of these by an innings, they won the First Test by eight wickets. Before the <b>Second</b> <b>Test,</b> they defeated Northamptonshire by an innings before drawing with Yorkshire. Bradman's men then crushed England by 409 runs in the <b>Second</b> <b>Test</b> at Lord's. Between Tests, they defeated Surrey by ten wickets and crushed Gloucestershire by an innings and 363 runs, having amassed 774/7 declared, their highest score of the season, and the second highest ever by an Australian team in England.|$|E
5|$|Such was his {{performance}} in the series that his scores of 11 and 60 in the <b>Second</b> <b>Test,</b> top-scoring in the second innings, were his worst, as Australia lost their first Test to South Africa for 42 years.|$|E
5|$|After scoring 39 in {{the first}} innings in the <b>Second</b> <b>Test</b> at Lord's, Macartney took 1/90, {{removing}} centurion Jack Hobbs as England took a 92-run first innings lead. He then scored 133 not out in the second innings, to help to stave off defeat. Australia were 5/194 when the match ended, and {{were it not for}} Macartney's effort could have been bowled out.|$|E

5|$|Australia went on {{to start}} the post-war Ashes era with a {{crushing}} win by an innings and 332 runs. Hassett made 34 as Australia won the <b>Second</b> <b>Test</b> by an innings, and the Third Test was his first Test on his home ground at the MCG. He made only 12 and 9 as England held on for a draw with three wickets in hand.|$|E
5|$|Australia's success {{came at a}} cost, with Lindwall {{injured and}} unable to bowl in the lead-up to the <b>Second</b> <b>Test,</b> missing the {{intervening}} matches against Northamptonshire and Yorkshire. The heavy workload on Miller caused by Lindwall's breaking down mid-Test generated severe back pain, {{and he was still}} not fully recovered by the start of the <b>Second</b> <b>Test</b> at Lord's. Lindwall was subjected to a thorough fitness test on the first morning of the Lord's Test. Bradman was not convinced of Lindwall's fitness, but the bowler's protestations were sufficient to convince his captain to risk his inclusion. Australia won the toss and elected to bat, allowing Lindwall further time to recover from his injury. Miller also played, but still nursing his back, was unfit to bowl.|$|E

5|$|Back in England, Trescothick {{was called}} upon to captain England after Michael Vaughan {{sustained}} a knee injury. Although other England captains had seemed to suffer a lack of batting form, the extra authority did not affect Trescothick, and he forged a good partnership with debutant Andrew Strauss against New Zealand. This understanding developed in the <b>second</b> <b>Test</b> with a first-wicket partnership of 153; Trescothick went on to score 132, his sixth Test century. Trescothick's partnerships with Strauss were to average 52.35 in 52 innings. His first century against the West Indies followed in the <b>second</b> <b>Test,</b> and Trescothick became {{the first player to}} make centuries in both innings of a Test match at Edgbaston, and the ninth England player to score a century in each innings of a Test match. Trescothick was again England's best One Day International batsman in the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy, scoring 261 runs in just four innings, including a century in the final; he also took his fourth ODI wicket.|$|E
5|$|Before the <b>second</b> <b>Test</b> John {{played in}} two more tour matches; wins over Southland and New Zealand Universities, {{in which he}} scored 32points. In the game against the Universities John scored {{one of his most}} famous tries. John dummied a drop-goal before running through the Universities' defence, {{stepping}} inside the final tackler before touching the ball down under the posts, stunning the home crowd. The <b>second</b> <b>Test,</b> played at Christchurch, finished with the series drawn after New Zealand won 22–12, John scoring half of the Lions points. In between the second and third Tests, John played in three of the four regional matches, scoring 37points including two tries in the game against Wairarapa.|$|E
5|$|Between Tests, Barnes {{played in}} the match against Northamptonshire, which started the day after Trent Bridge. Barnes made 11 and bowled three wicketless overs as Australia cruised to victory by an innings. In the second match—a drawn fixture against Yorkshire—before the <b>Second</b> <b>Test,</b> Barnes managed only a duckbowled {{at the start of}} the match by a {{swinging}} yorker from Ron Aspinalland six.|$|E
50|$|Usually, the fab {{charges for}} testing time, with {{prices in the}} order of cents per <b>second.</b> <b>Testing</b> times vary from a few {{milliseconds}} to a couple of <b>seconds,</b> and the <b>test</b> software is optimized for reduced testing time. Multiple chip (multi-site) testing is also possible, because many testers have the resources to perform most or all of the tests in parallel.|$|R
50|$|Selected for the 1997 British and Irish Lions tour to South Africa, Regan had {{a notable}} rivalry with Keith Wood. Although he was {{kept out of}} the first and <b>second</b> <b>tests</b> by the Irishman, Regan did play in the final test.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} test our various hypotheses, three {{alternative}} models were assessed for model fit {{based on the}} Akaike information criterion (AIC). All models included the subject identification variable as a random factor. The first model tested the effect of time, while the <b>second</b> <b>tested</b> {{the effect of the}} intervention on the outcomes, and the third tested both the effect of the intervention and the interaction between time and the intervention. The first model tests the hypothesis that any change in outcomes is due to natural growth, while the <b>second</b> <b>tests</b> whether the intervention is an explanatory factor for the observed changes, and the third tests whether the effects remain at follow-up or decrease with time.|$|R
5|$|Between Tests, Hamence earned {{selection}} for the match against Northamptonshire, batting at No. 4 and scoring 34; he partnered acting captain Hassett in {{a stand of}} 104 for the third wicket. He took 1/11 in the second innings as Australia won by an innings. In the second match before the <b>Second</b> <b>Test,</b> which was against Yorkshire, Hamence made 48 and six not out, and took a total of 1/17 as the game ended in a draw. He batted slowly and cautiously; Bradman gave him few opportunities, {{so he had to}} make the most of them. The first innings 48 was a determined performance on a sticky wicket that helped Australia to 249; Bradman felt that Hamence's grit was a notable factor in Australia managing to pass 200. Harvey made 49 and 56 while Brown made 19 and 113 as an opener. This was enough for Brown to retain his middle-order position for the <b>Second</b> <b>Test</b> at Lord's, where Australia fielded an unchanged team. Australia went on to a crushing win by 409 runs but Brown made only 24 and 32.|$|E
5|$|Between Tests, McCool was {{recalled}} for {{the match}} against Northamptonshire. He took 1/19 {{in the first}} innings before coming in at {{the fall of the}} fifth wicket and scoring an unbeaten 50 as Australia declared at 8/352. McCool only bowled three overs in the second innings and went wicketless as Australia won by an innings. Johnson, the incumbent Test spinner, took 4/59. In the second match before the <b>Second</b> <b>Test,</b> against Yorkshire, McCool made only four and seven not out before Australia declared in their second innings. After not being bowled in the first innings, he took 2/33 in the last hour of the match as Yorkshire ended at 4/85 to secure a draw. McCool was overlooked for the <b>Second</b> <b>Test</b> at Lord's, where Australia fielded the same XI that had won the First Test by eight wickets. Bradman's men went on to complete a crushing win by 409 runs, and Johnson registered match figures of 3/75.|$|E
5|$|Brought {{back into}} the side for the <b>second</b> <b>Test</b> for the injured John Crawley, Key made a solitary run in the first innings, batting at number three, before being caught off the bowling of Shane Warne just after the lunch break.

40|$|Source of support: Departmental sources Background: The Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) {{was used}} to explore which tests and their {{measures}} are able to detect cognitive change after a single dose of donepezil in Alzheimer disease (AD) patients. The {{aim of this study}} was to establish the ability of CANTAB tests and their measures to detect cog-nitive change after a single 5 -mg dose of donepezil in treatment-naïve AD patients. Material/Methods: We enrolled 62 treatment-naïve AD patients and 30 healthy controls in this prospective, randomized, rat-er-blinded study. AD patients were randomized to 2 groups: the AD+ group received donepezil after the first CANTAB testing and the AD – group remained treatment-naïve at <b>second</b> <b>testing.</b> The time period between re-peated testing was 4 hours. Parallel versions of CRT, SOC, PAL, SWM, and PRM tests were used. Results: All groups did not differ according to age, education, gender, or depression (p> 0. 05). AD+ and AD – groups did not differ according to MMSE. SOC, PAL, PRM, and SWM tests distinguished AD from controls. Eight measures of PAL and PRM had a strong correlation with MMSE (r> 0. 7). Repeated-measures ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc test showed the difference of change in AD+ and AD – groups between first and <b>second</b> CANTAB <b>testing</b> in 7 PAL measures. AD+ and AD – groups differed in the <b>second</b> <b>testing</b> by 7 PAL measures. Four PAL measures differed in first and <b>second</b> <b>testing</b> within the AD+ group...|$|R

5|$|England {{dominated}} the <b>second</b> <b>Test,</b> {{largely due to}} the bowling of Briggs. Batting first, England scored 292 runs, of which Abel contributed 120. Fothergill claimed the first South African wicket, Albert Rose-Innes {{at the end of the}} first day, but only claimed two more in the match, as Briggs took fifteen wickets on the second day to help England to an innings and 202-run victory.|$|E
5|$|England {{played two}} Test matches against Pakistan in June 2001. Although Trescothick scored 117 in the <b>second</b> <b>Test,</b> {{it was not}} enough for England to win the match.
