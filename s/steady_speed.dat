When {{being pursued by}} a predator, they {{have been known to}} reach speeds in excess of , and can maintain a <b>steady</b> <b>speed</b> of , which makes the common ostrich the world's fastest two-legged animal. When lying down and hiding from predators, the birds lay their heads and necks flat on the ground, making them appear like a mound of earth from a distance, aided by the heat haze in their hot, dry habitat.|$|E
25|$|Classical sources {{indicate}} that the trireme was capable of sustained speeds of ca. 6 knots at a relatively leisurely pace. There is also a reference by Xenophon of a single day's voyage from Byzantium to Heraclea Pontica, which translates as an average speed of 7.37 knots. These figures seem to be corroborated by the tests conducted with the reconstructed Olympias: a maximum speed of 8 knots and a <b>steady</b> <b>speed</b> of 4 knots could be maintained, with half the crew resting at a time. Given the imperfect nature of the reconstructed ship {{as well as the}} fact that it was manned by totally untrained modern men and women, it is reasonable to suggest that ancient triremes, expertly built and navigated by trained men, would attain higher speeds.|$|E
50|$|Another {{limitation}} of early steam engines was speed variability, which made them unsuitable for many textile applications, especially spinning. In {{order to obtain}} <b>steady</b> <b>speeds,</b> early steam powered textile mills used the steam engine to pump water to a water wheel, which drove the machinery.|$|R
50|$|Chrysler's Multi-Displacement System (MDS) is an {{automobile}} engine variable displacement technology. It debuted in 2004 on the 5.7 L modern Hemi V8.

25|$|The AWD {{model of}} the G35 sedan is called the G35x. Although the {{automatic}} transmission for the G35x is manufactured by Aisin-Warner, the AWD technology uses Nissan's proprietary ATTESA E-TS AWD system. The system will make the car 100% rear wheel drive when driving at a <b>steady</b> <b>speed.</b> When the driver uses the throttle to accelerate from a stop or constant speed, the AWD system can send up to 50% of torque to the front wheels. When the car's speed becomes steady again, the drivetrain will return torque to the rear wheels. The AWD system will also transfer torque to the front wheels if the system detects loss of traction. This technology was first used in the 1989 Nissan Skyline GT-R, and has since been used in subsequent Skylines, and other vehicles in Japan and overseas, including the Nissan Bluebird, and Nissan Stagea.|$|E
500|$|Given {{the small}} {{dimension}} of the tunnels {{as well as the}} difficulty of providing sufficient ventilation, steam power, as used on London's other underground railways, was not feasible for a deep tube railway.

500|$|It was at {{this point}} that the first {{indication}} that something was dangerously amiss during the transit occurred. The executive officer, who passed through the chart room while preparing for the shift change, noticed that Missouri was rapidly approaching the shoal water, and promptly told Morris [...] "For God's sake watch it!" [...] At the same time a discussion occurred on the eighth-level bridge as to whether it would be advisable for the battleship's speed to be increased to 15knots. Morris and Millet differed in opinion on the idea; the former felt speed should be reduced five knots, and the latter felt that any <b>steady</b> <b>speed</b> held during the transition would be okay. Captain Brown therefore decided to increase speed to 15knots, and the engine room replied by increasing power.|$|E

2500|$|Economy also {{requires}} that the throttle be wide open and that the boiler pressure is at the maximum safe level to maximise thermal efficiency. [...] For economy, a steam engine is used of a size such that the most economical settings yield {{the right amount of}} power most of the time, such as when a train is running at <b>steady</b> <b>speed</b> on level track.|$|E
50|$|Fuel {{economy at}} <b>steady</b> <b>speeds</b> with {{selected}} vehicles was studied in 2010. The most recent study indicates greater fuel efficiency at higher speeds than earlier studies; for example, some vehicles achieve better fuel economy at 100 km/h {{rather than at}} 70 km/h, although not their best economy, such as the 1994 Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera with the LN2 2.2L engine, which has its best economy at 90 km/h (8.1 L/100 km mpg), and gets 2 mpg better economy at 105 km/h than at 72 km/h (9.4 L/100 km mpg vs 22 mpg). The proportion of driving on high speed roadways varies from 4% in Ireland to 41% in the Netherlands.|$|R

The work has concentrated mainly on electric thrusters for tethered work-class remotely operated vehicles, which work at fairly low vehicle speeds, as a replacement for existing hydraulic thrusters. It is also relevant to untethered autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), that are typically designed for longer-range inspection work at moderate, <b>steady</b> <b>speeds.</b> There is also ongoing research on a novel type of electric motor, capable of high output power and high efficiency at low speed, which is seen as potentially suitable for AUV thrusters...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} biped {{locomotion}} at <b>steady</b> <b>speeds</b> is discussed through a Lagrangian formulation developed for velocity-dependent, body driving forces. Human {{walking on a}} level surface is analyzed {{in terms of the}} data on the resultant ground-reaction force and the external work. It is shown that the trajectory of the center of mass is due to a superposition of its rectilinear motion with a given speed and a backward rotation along a shortened hypocycloid. A stiff-to-compliant crossover between walking gaits is described and the maximum speed for human walking, given by an instability of the trajectory, is predicted.

40|$|The {{generation}} {{and evolution of}} small amplitude long wavelength traveling disturbances in rotating-disk flow are discussed. The <b>steady</b> rotational <b>speed</b> of the disk is perturbed so as to introduce high-frequency oscillations in the flow field. Secondly, surface imperfections on the disk such as roughness elements are introduced. The interaction of these two disturbances will generate the instability waves whose evolution is governed by parabolic partial differential equations which are solved numerically. It is found that, for the class of disturbances considered here (wavelength {{on the order of}} Reynolds number), eigensolutions exist which decay or grow algebraically in the radial direction.

50|$|Overdrive ('D', 'OD', or a boxed D or {{the absence}} of an {{illuminated}} 'O/D OFF'): This mode is used in some transmissions to allow early computer-controlled transmissions to engage the automatic overdrive. In these transmissions, Drive (D) locks the automatic overdrive off, but is identical otherwise. OD (Overdrive) in these cars is engaged under <b>steady</b> <b>speeds</b> or low acceleration at approximately 35 - 45 mph. Under hard acceleration or below 35 - 45 mph, the transmission will automatically downshift. Other vehicles with this selector (for example light trucks) will not only disable up-shift to the overdrive gear, but keep the remaining gears available for use of engine braking. Drivers should verify the behaviour of this switch and consider the benefits of reduced friction brake use when city driving where speeds typically do not necessitate the overdrive gear.|$|R

40|$|The {{kinematics}} and hydrodynamics {{of routine}} linear accelerations were studied in American eels, Anguilla rostrata, using high-speed video and particle image velocimetry. Eels were examined both during <b>steady</b> swimming at <b>speeds</b> from 0. 6 to 1. 9 body lengths (L) per second and during accelerations from - 1. 4 to 1. 3 L s(- 2). Multiple regression of the acceleration and <b>steady</b> swimming <b>speed</b> {{on the body}} kinematics suggests that eels primarily change their tail-tip velocity during acceleration.

Thus, during steady swimming, Strouhal number does not vary with speed, remaining close to 0. 32, but during acceleration, it deviates from the steady value. The kinematic changes during acceleration are indicated hydrodynamically by axial fluid momentum in the wake. During steady swimming, the wake consists of lateral jets of fluid and has minimal net axial momentum, which reflects a balance between thrust and drag. During acceleration, those jets rotate to point downstream, adding axial momentum to the fluid. The amount of added momentum correlates with the acceleration, but is greater than the necessary inertial force by 2. 8 +/- 0. 6 times, indicating a substantial acceleration reaction...|$|R
