[...] It has four nationally rare plants, Spanish catchfly, Boehmer's cat's-tail, Breckland Wild Thyme and <b>spring</b> <b>speedwell.</b> Nationally rare stone curlews breed there.|$|E
50|$|State Route 69 (SR 69) is {{a primary}} state highway in the U.S. state of Virginia. Known as Lead Mine Road, the state highway runs 3.59 mi from SR 636 in Austinville east to U.S. Route 52 (US 52) in Poplar Camp. SR 69 is the last remnant of a much longer route. At its peak from 1940 to 1945, this route (then {{numbered}} State Route 81) ran from State Route 91 at Lodi east via St. Clair Bottom, Sugar Grove, Cedar <b>Springs,</b> <b>Speedwell,</b> Porters Crossroads, and Austinville to today's SR 69. However, it was never fully continuous; portions from Sugar Grove to Cedar Springs and west of Porters Crossroads to east of Austinville were secondary routes. The full length of this route as it existed and was planned {{is now part of}} SR 762, part of SR 660, all of SR 650, part of SR 16 (and SR 695, its former alignment at Sugar Grove), all of SR 614, part of SR 749, part of US 21, part of SR 690, a small piece of SR 642, part of SR 619, part of SR 636, and SR 69.|$|R
2500|$|The {{two ships}} set sail about August 5, but the {{unseaworthy}} <b>Speedwell</b> <b>sprang</b> a leak shortly after, and the ships {{were put into}} Dartmouth for repairs. The two ships made a new start after the repairs, and they were more than 200 miles (320 km) beyond Land's End at the southwestern tip of England when <b>Speedwell</b> <b>sprang</b> another leak. It was now early September, {{and they had no}} choice but to abandon the Speedwell and make a determination on her passengers. This was a dire event, as the ship had wasted vital funds and was considered very important to the future success of their settlement in America. Speedwell was sold soon after the Mayflower continued on her voyage to America. According to Bradford, she was refitted and [...] "made many voyages... to the great profit of her owners." [...] Bradford later assumed that Speedwell master Reynolds's [...] "cunning and deceit" [...] (in causing what may have been man-made leaks in the ship) had been motivated by a fear of starving to death in America.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} smaller SSSI areas {{are found in}} the Icklingham area. These include Berner's Heath, the largest area of heather {{heathland}} in Breckland at 149.6 ha, and Deadman's Grave, a grassland heath area of 126.3 ha, both of which are north of the village. Cavenham-Icklingham Heaths, to the south-east of the village, is 418.8 ha in area and includes a number of woodland habitats. All contain rare species such as Rosser's sac spider (Clubiona rosserae) and the soldier-fly (Odontomyia angulata) as well as stone curlew and plant species such as Breckland wild thyme (Thymus serpyllum) and <b>spring</b> <b>speedwell</b> (Veronica verna).|$|E
