He and the other discharged soldiers have difficulty fitting into a <b>society</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> evolved almost beyond their comprehension. The veterans learn that, to curb overpopulation, which led to worldwide class wars caused by inequitable rationing, homosexuality has become officially encouraged {{by many of the}} world's nations. The world has become a very dangerous place due to widespread unemployment and the easy availability of deadly weapons. The changes within society alienate Mandella and the other veterans to the point where many re-enlist to escape, despite the extremely high casualty rate and their recognition that the military is a soulless construct. Mandella and Potter receive promised postings as instructors on Luna, but upon arrival are immediately reassigned to a combat command.|$|E
25|$|The evangelical revelation {{contains}} the truth on the violence, available for two thousand years, Girard tells us. Has it {{put an end}} to the sacrificial order based on violence in the <b>society</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> claimed the gospel text as its own religious text? No, he replies, since in order for a truth to have an impact it must find a receptive listener, and people do not change that quickly. The gospel text has instead acted as a ferment that brings about the decomposition of the sacrificial order. While medieval Europe showed the face of a sacrificial society that still knew very well how to despise and ignore its victims, nonetheless the efficacy of sacrificial violence has never stopped decreasing, in the measure that ignorance receded. Here Girard sees the principle of the uniqueness and of the transformations of the Western society whose destiny today is one with that of human society as a whole.|$|E
500|$|Although he {{was mostly}} {{overlooked}} by historians of the Middle East, some scholars view Zahir's rule as a forerunner to Palestinian nationalism. Among these scholars is Karl Sabbagh, who asserts the latter view {{in his book}} Palestine: A Personal History, which was widely reviewed in the British press in 2010. Zahir was gradually integrated into Palestinian historiography. In Murad Mustafa Dabbagh's Biladuna Filastin (1965), a multi-volume work about Palestine's history, Zahir {{is referred to as}} the [...] "greatest Palestinian appearing in the eighteenth century". The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) radio station, Voice of Palestine, broadcast a series about Zahir in 1966, praising him as a Palestinian national hero who fought against Ottoman imperialism. Zahir is considered by many Arab nationalists as a pioneer of Arab liberation from foreign occupation. According to Joudah However historians may look at Shaykh Zahir al-'Umar and his movement, he is highly respected by the Arabs of the East. In particular the Palestinians consider him a national hero who struggled against Ottoman authority for the welfare of his people. This praise is reflected in the recent academic, cultural and literary renaissance within Palestinian <b>society</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> elevated Zahir and his legacy to near-iconic status. These re-readings are not always bound to historical objectivity but are largely inspired by the ongoing consequences of the Nakba. Still it is precise to say that Shaykh Zahir had successfully established an autonomous state, or a [...] "little Kingdom," [...] as Albert Hourani called it, in most of Palestine for over a quarter of a century.|$|E

2500|$|Second-wave pro-feminism paid {{increased}} attention {{to issues of}} sexuality, particularly the relationship between homosexual men and hegemonic masculinity. This shift led to more cooperation between the men's liberation and gay liberation movements.

2500|$|Some sociobiologists, such as Steven Goldberg, {{argue that}} social {{behavior}} is primarily determined by genetics, and thus that patriarchy arises {{more as a}} result of inherent biology than social conditioning. Goldberg also contends that patriarchy is a universal feature of human culture. In 1973, Goldberg wrote, [...] "The ethnographic studies of every <b>society</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> ever been observed explicitly state that these feelings were present, there is literally no variation at all." [...] Goldberg has critics among anthropologists. Concerning Goldberg's claims about the [...] "feelings of both men and women", Eleanor Leacock countered in 1974 that the data on women's attitudes are [...] "sparse and contradictory", and that the data on male attitudes about male-female relations are [...] "ambiguous". [...] Also, the effects of colonialism on the cultures represented in the studies were not considered.|$|E
2500|$|In 1798, Thomas Robert Malthus wrote An Essay on the Principle of Population in {{response}} to Godwin's views on the [...] "perfectibility of society." [...] Malthus wrote that populations are inclined to increase in times of plenty, and that only distress, from causes such as food shortages, disease, or war, serves to stem population growth. Populations in his view are therefore always doomed to grow until distress is felt, at least by the poorer segment of the society. Consequently, poverty was felt to be an inevitable phenomenon of society.Let us imagine for a moment Mr. Godwin's beautiful system of equality realized in its utmost purity, and see how soon this difficulty {{might be expected to}} press under so perfect a form of society.... Let us suppose all the causes of misery and vice in this island removed. War and contention cease. Unwholesome trades and manufactories do not exist. Crowds no longer collect together in great and pestilent cities.... Every house is clean, airy, sufficiently roomy, and in a healthy situation.... And the necessary labours of agriculture are shared amicably among all. The number of persons, and the produce of the island, we suppose to be the same as at present. The spirit of benevolence, guided by impartial justice, will divide this produce among {{all the members of the}} society according to their wants....With these extraordinary encouragements to population, and every cause of depopulation, as we have supposed, removed, the numbers would necessarily increase faster than in any <b>society</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> ever yet been known....|$|E
