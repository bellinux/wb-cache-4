5|$|Printed pattern {{books were}} not easily obtainable, and a sampler or {{embroidered}} record of stitches and patterns {{was the most}} common form of reference. 16th-century English samplers were <b>stitched</b> on a narrow band of fabric and totally covered with stitches. These band samplers were highly valued, often being mentioned in wills and passed down through the generations. These samplers were <b>stitched</b> using a variety of needlework styles, threads, and ornament.|$|E
5|$|Tessellated designs {{often appear}} on textiles, whether woven, <b>stitched</b> in or printed. Tessellation {{patterns}} {{have been used}} to design interlocking motifs of patch shapes in quilts.|$|E
5|$|Clothing was {{historically}} {{made from}} woven raffia. The fibers would be combed into strands that were knotted {{together to form}} cords, which were then woven into panels. These panels were <b>stitched</b> together to create prayer rugs and clothing. Women and men historically wore long raffia smocks.|$|E

5|$|Artisans {{from across}} India were {{recruited}} to craft the props. The costumes {{were designed by}} Makhanlal and Company, and Delhi-based tailors skilled in zardozi embroidery <b>stitched</b> the Mughal costume. The footwear was ordered from Agra, the jewellery was made by goldsmiths in Hyderabad, the crowns were designed in Kolhapur, and blacksmiths from Rajasthan manufactured the armoury (which included shields, swords, spears, daggers, and armour). The zardozi on costumes were also <b>stitched</b> by designers from Surat. A statue of Lord Krishna, to which Jodhabai prayed, was made of gold. In the scenes involving an imprisoned Anarkali, real chains were placed on Madhubala. The battle sequence between Akbar and Salim reportedly featured 2,000 camels, 400 horses, and 8,000 troops, mainly from the Indian Army's Jaipur cavalry, 56th Regiment. Dilip Kumar has spoken of the intense heat during filming of the sequence in the desert of Rajasthan, wearing full armour.|$|E
5|$|Fernandez was {{approached}} by fellow designer and stylist Formichetti to produce the dress, with it planned out {{over the course of}} a week, Formichetti having styled the look. The dress was asymmetrical, with a cowled–neck. Fernandez specifically chose cuts to ensure that the dress kept well. Flank steak was chosen as the material to use, with the meat coming from his family butcher. The dress required Gaga to be <b>stitched</b> into the outfit backstage.|$|E
5|$|Ralf Schumacher {{suffered}} a three-inch gash {{on his left}} calf. He was taken to Princess Grace Hospital for a routine check-up and his cut was <b>stitched.</b> Ralf Schumacher was later cleared to race in the next Grand Prix, two weeks later.

5|$|The Secretary of State regulates flag {{protocol}} {{as well as}} {{the distribution}} and sale of the state flag. Replica flags made for commercial sale are required to be approved by the Secretary of State. The state seal on the flag must be <b>stitched</b> on both sides with the profile of George Washington facing the same direction, making the Washington state flag among the most expensive U.S. state flags to manufacture.|$|E
5|$|After the {{founding}} of Night School Studio, the team set up a casting call for voice actors on Backstage. Prior to actors being cast and their lines recorded, the team had placeholder subtitles in the game. Lead engineer Bryant Cannon recalled that without the voices, he was unsure whether the game {{would be fun to}} play; after the voices were added, he could see the characters as believable people having conversations. Hines directed recording sessions, allowing him to change dialogue on-the-fly if he felt material did not work when voiced by the actors. All of the actors voiced their lines separately, with their conversations in-game <b>stitched</b> together in post-production.|$|E
5|$|Cotton was domesticated in India by 4000 BCE. Traditional Indian dress {{varies in}} colour and style across regions and depends on various factors, {{including}} climate and faith. Popular styles of dress include draped garments {{such as the}} sari for women and the dhoti or lungi for men. <b>Stitched</b> clothes, such as the shalwar kameez for women and kurta–pyjama combinations or European-style trousers and shirts for men, are also popular. Use of delicate jewellery, modelled on real flowers worn in ancient India, {{is part of a}} tradition dating back some 5,000 years; gemstones are also worn in India as talismans.|$|E
50|$|There {{are five}} main types of basic <b>stitches</b> (the {{following}} description uses US crochet terminology which {{differs from the}} terminology used in the UK and Europe). 1.

5|$|Having {{ensured that}} {{sufficient}} tissue {{has been removed}} to allow the desired fusion of the skin, the circumciser pulls together the {{opposite sides of the}} labia majora, ensuring that the raw edges where the skin has been removed are well approximated. The wound is now ready to be <b>stitched</b> or for thorns to be applied. If a needle and thread are being used, close tight sutures will be placed to ensure that a flap of skin covers the vulva and extends from the mons veneris to the perineum, and which, after the wound heals, will form a bridge of scar tissue that will totally occlude the vaginal introitus.|$|E
5|$|Helmets made {{entirely of}} bronze were also used, {{while some of}} them had large cheek guards, {{probably}} <b>stitched</b> or riveted to the helmet, as well as an upper pierced knot to hold a crest. Small holes all around the cheek guards and the helmet's lower edge were used for the attachment of internal padding. Other types of bronze helmets were also used. During the late Mycenaean period, additional types were also used such as horned helmets made of strips of leather.|$|E
5|$|Many booklet stamps can be {{identified}} by one non-perforated edge, though a few are perforated on all edges. On booklets up to 1977, the printing plate construction enabled both upright and inverted watermarks in equal quantities owing to a gutter dividing rows 6 and 7 in the sheets of 12 × 10 stamps. The gutter was used for stitching during assembly, requiring rows 4–6 and 10–12 to be turned through 180 degrees so those panes could be <b>stitched</b> on {{the left of the}} booklet.|$|E

50|$|The Craft {{involves}} embroidering and <b>stitching.</b> For {{attaching the}} pieces of cloth articians use straight <b>stitch,</b> satin <b>stitch,</b> blind <b>stitch,</b> or buttonhole <b>stitch.</b> Sometimes they also make mirror work and many decorative <b>stitches.</b>|$|R
50|$|Kashmiri {{embroidery}} {{is known}} for the skilled execution of a single <b>stitch,</b> which is often called the Kashmiri <b>stitch</b> and which may comprise the chain <b>stitch,</b> the satin <b>stitch,</b> the slanted darn <b>stitch,</b> the stem <b>stitch,</b> and the herringbone <b>stitch.</b> Sometimes, the doori (knot) <b>stitches</b> are used {{but not more than}} one or two at a time.|$|R
5|$|Once woven, the {{material}} {{is sent to the}} BIS laboratories for testing. After quality testing, {{the material}}, if approved, is returned to the factory. It is then separated into three lots which are dyed saffron, white and green. The Ashoka Chakra is screen printed, stencilled or suitably embroidered onto each side of the white cloth. Care also has to be taken that the chakra is completely visible and synchronised on both sides. Three pieces of the required dimension, one of each colour, are then <b>stitched</b> together according to specifications and the final product is ironed and packed. The BIS then checks the colours and only then can the flag be sold.|$|E
5|$|Stamp {{booklets}} {{were first}} put on sale on 21 August 1931. Booklet construction was a lightweight cardboard cover <b>stitched</b> on the left-hand side with panes of stamps (usually four panes), advertising panes and interleaving bound in. Until 1956 most booklets had {{half of the}} front cover devoted to advertising, and until 1963 booklets also had serial numbers on the front cover: two numbers indicated the year of issue and serial number (in that order on the early issues but with the order reversed for later issues), until 1963 when the serial numbers ceased.|$|E
5|$|The classic legionary scutum, a convex {{rectangular}} shield, also disappeared {{during the}} 3rd century. All troops except archers adopted large, wide, usually dished, ovoid (or sometimes round) shields. These shields were still called Scuta or Clipei, despite {{the difference in}} shape. Shields, from examples found at Dura Europos and Nydam, were of vertical plank construction, the planks glued, and mostly faced inside and out with painted leather. The edges of the shield were bound with <b>stitched</b> rawhide, which shrank as it dried improving structural cohesion.|$|E
50|$|Additional {{variables}} {{in the types of}} overlock <b>stitches</b> are the <b>stitch</b> eccentric, and the <b>stitch</b> width. The <b>stitch</b> eccentric indicates how many <b>stitches</b> per inch there are, which is adjustable and can vary widely within one machine. Different <b>stitch</b> eccentrics create more or less dense and solid-looking edges. The <b>stitch</b> width indicates how wide the <b>stitch</b> is {{from the edge of the}} fabric. Lightweight fabrics often require a wider <b>stitch</b> to prevent pulling.|$|R

Atalah {{is said to have}} had a diamond with him (<b>stitched</b> into the lining of his suit), Limpert was bringing her dead husband's ashes with her, and Simpson was functioning as a King's Messenger with diplomatic documents destined for the British embassy in Santiago.|$|E
5|$|The {{types of}} prisoners were {{distinguishable}} by triangular pieces of cloth, called Winkel, sewn onto on their jackets below their prisoner number. Political prisoners had a red triangle, Jehovah's Witnesses had purple, criminals had green, and so on. The nationality of the inmate was indicated by a letter <b>stitched</b> onto the Winkel. Jews had a yellow triangle, overlaid {{by a second}} Winkel if they also fit into a second category. Uniquely at Auschwitz, prisoners were tattooed with their prisoner number, on the chest for Soviet prisoners of war and on the left arm for civilians.|$|E
5|$|After 170 {{minutes of}} slow batting, Edrich gloved a rising Lindwall {{delivery}} and was caught behind by wicket-keeper Don Tallon. At 119/5, Compton {{returned to the}} field, his head wound having been <b>stitched</b> to stop the bleeding. He and Yardley played carefully until the tea break, and only the England captain offered a chance; Barnes was unable to complete the reflex catch at short leg from the bowling of Toshack. After the resumption of play, Yardley on-drove Lindwall for a four, but lofted Ernie Toshack, who had been bowling leg theory, into the packed on-side where he was caught by Johnson at forward square leg. Toshack's defensive bowling had caused the English skipper to lose patience and his departure for 22 left the score on 141/6.|$|E

50|$|In {{securing}} the previous <b>stitch</b> in a wale, the next <b>stitch</b> can {{pass through the}} previous loop either from below or above. If the former, the <b>stitch</b> is denoted as a knit <b>stitch</b> or a plain stitch; if the latter, as a purl <b>stitch.</b> The two <b>stitches</b> are related in that a knit <b>stitch</b> seen {{from one side of}} the fabric appears as a purl <b>stitch</b> on the other side.|$|R
