5|$|A gene is a <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> DNA that {{contains}} genetic information and {{can influence the}} phenotype of an organism. Within a gene, the <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> bases along a DNA strand defines a messenger RNA sequence, which then defines one or more protein sequences. The relationship between the nucleotide sequences of genes and the amino-acid sequences of proteins {{is determined by the}} rules of translation, known collectively as the genetic code. The genetic code consists of three-letter 'words' called codons formed from a <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> three nucleotides (e.g. ACT, CAG, TTT).|$|E

40|$|A phrase {{discovery}} {{is a method}} <b>of</b> identifying <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> terms in a database.

Next, several shorter <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> terms, such as phrases, are extracted from the provided relevant <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> terms.

A gathering process then emphasizes the more relevant of the extracted and culled <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> terms and de-emphasizes the more generic of the extracted and culled <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> terms. The gathering process can also include iteratively retrieving additional selections <b>of</b> relevant <b>sequences</b> (e. g [...] text). extracting and culling additional <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> terms (e. g [...] phrases). emphasizing and de-emphasizing extracted and culled <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> terms and accumulating all gathered <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> terms.

30|$|The concept <b>of</b> {{convergence}} <b>of</b> <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> points {{has been}} extended by several authors [13 – 20] to the convergence <b>of</b> <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> sets. In this paper we consider one such extension, namely, Wijsman convergence. Nuray and Rhoades [21] extended the notion of Wijsman convergence <b>of</b> <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> sets to that of Wijsman statistical convergence <b>of</b> <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> sets, and gave some basic theorems. Also, they introduced the notion of Wijsman strong Cesàro summability <b>of</b> <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> sets and discussed its relation with Wijsman statistical convergence. Ulusu and Nuray [22] introduced the concepts of Wijsman lacunary statistical convergence <b>of</b> <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> sets and Wijsman lacunary strong convergence <b>of</b> <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> sets and established a relation between them.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the summability {{properties}} <b>of</b> double <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> real constants which map <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> random variables to <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> random variables that are defined {{on the same}} probability sample space.

It is not necessarily regular on <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> random variables with convergence in probability. We extend these results to random variables with values in extended real numbers (extended real numbers include infinite values, see definitions 2. 2 and 2. 3). For this we introduce a construction {{that allows us to}} multiply <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> extended real numbers with infinite real matrices...|$|R

5|$|In DNA replication, DNA-dependent DNA polymerases {{make copies}} of DNA polynucleotide chains. To {{preserve}} biological information, {{it is essential that}} the <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> bases in each copy are precisely complementary to the <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> bases in the template strand. Many DNA polymerases have a proofreading activity. Here, the polymerase recognizes the occasional mistakes in the synthesis reaction by the lack of base pairing between the mismatched nucleotides. If a mismatch is detected, a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity is activated and the incorrect base removed. In most organisms, DNA polymerases function in a large complex called the replisome that contains multiple accessory subunits, such as the DNA clamp or helicases.|$|E
