40|$|Report of the {{research}} project on spinning of cellulose fibers {{by means of the}} Lyocell process using N-methyl morpholin-N-oxide as the solvent. In course of the spinning process, dispersed solids like pigments may be added to the spinning solution and thus be incorporated into the resulted cellulose fibers. Addition of the dispersed solids should be performed near the <b>spinning</b> <b>die</b> to prevent thinning effects of the spinning solution and diminish 'contamination' of the spinning line. Therefor, an existing spinning line has been modified to enable the direct dosing of the solid material, dispersed in N-methylmorpholin-N-oxide. The obtained fibers were characterized by strength, elongation and finess and the spinning process could be optimized.

40|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{system of}} equations of relativistic Lorentz electrodynamics (LED) is studied in a “gyroscopic setup ” in which the Lorentz electron is assumed to remain at rest, leaving the electromagnetic fields and the particle spin as the only dynamical degrees of freedom. The global existence and uniqueness of this gyroscopic spin-plus-field dynamics in unbounded space is proven. It is further shown that for rotation-reflection symmetric initial data any gyroscopic solution also satisfies the world-line equations consistent with a non-moving Lorentz electron, thus furnishing a proper solution of the complete set of equations of LED. Rotation-reflection symmetric scattering is shown to occur for sufficiently small ratio of electrostatic to (positive) bare rest mass, with deviations from the stationary <b>spin</b> state <b>dying</b> out exponentially fast through radiation damping.

40|$|Non-resonant {{microwave}} absorption {{has been}} proven as a highly sensitive method to screen for supraconductivity. Furthermore, in special cases the microstructure of the superconducting material, which is connected by Josephson junctions, can be determined. In single crystals the pinning potential can be measured {{and it has been}} demonstrated for the 123 material, that the critical current density is limited by the existence of non-superconducting layers. Decoration of superconducting thin films with stable paramagnetic molecules was utilized to measure the typical length scale of field inhomogenities at the surfaces. These inhomogenities are probably generated by growth inhomogenities characteristic for epitactic thin films. Their influence dominates the field variance expected for an ideal typ II superconductor.

40|$|Abstract. A {{three-dimensional}} {{finite element}} model for <b>die</b> <b>spinning</b> of a cylindrical workpiece is established and a practical spinning process of 5 A 06 alloy tube is simulated with the model and Marc software. The rotation of the workpiece driven by the die and the passive rotations of spinning wheels due to the friction between the spinning wheels and the workpiece are considered in this model. The distributions of stress and strain of deformation region are analyzed. The phenomena during tube spinning are simulated, such as build-up, shape distortion, diametric reduction and increment. From the simulated results, it is concluded: Consideration of the quality and efficiency of production, spinning speed should not be too large. In this study, the simulation process should not exceed 0. 8 mm/s the traction speed. Spinning force is direct proportional to the traction speed and inverse proportion to the tip radius. This model reprents the spinning deformation behaviors completely. Simulation results correspond with the experiments very well...|$|R
50|$|Melt-blown {{nonwovens}} {{are produced}} by extruding melted polymer fibers through a <b>spin</b> net or <b>die</b> consisting of up to 40 holes per inch to form long thin fibers which are stretched and cooled by passing hot air over the fibers as they fall from the die. The resultant web is collected into rolls and subsequently converted to finished products. The extremely fine fibers (typically polypropylene) differ from other extrusions, particularly spun bond, in that they have low intrinsic strength but much smaller size offering key properties. Often melt blown is added to spun bond to form SM or SMS webs, which are strong and offer the intrinsic benefits of fine fibers such as fine filtration, low pressure drop as used in face masks or filters and physical benefits such as acoustic insulation as used in dishwashers. One of the largest users of SM and SMS materials is the disposable diaper and feminine care industry.|$|R
