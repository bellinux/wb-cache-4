25|$|During 1965â€“1966, {{the final}} grade {{railroad}} crossings were eliminated between the Jefferson Avenue and Grant City stations. In {{order to avoid}} interfering with train service, a <b>shoo-fly</b> <b>track</b> was constructed {{to the east of}} the original line, while a new crossing free line was constructed upon the original right of way. The SIRT continued to lose money even as it rebuilt stations between Jefferson Avenue and New Dorp almost into the 1970s. The closing of Bethlehem Steel in 1960, and of U.S. Gypsum in 1972 led to a dramatic decline in rail traffic via the Arthur Kill Bridge; however, there still was enough traffic in the 1970s to keep car floats reasonably busy.|$|E
50|$|A {{groundbreaking}} {{ceremony for}} the $20 million station {{was held on}} May 12, 2015, still with an expected opening {{in the fall of}} 2016. Construction began in October 2015 with the removal of the three yard tracks at the station site. The inner part of the Framingham/Worcester Line was closed for a weekend in December 2015 to allow construction of a temporary <b>shoo-fly</b> <b>track,</b> which allows the mainline track to be removed during construction. The mainline tracks were put back in service during a similar weekend shutdown in April 2017, restoring double track through Allston {{for the first time since}} the 1950s.|$|E
