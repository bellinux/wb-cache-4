25|$|At the Battle of Gettysburg on July 1, Gordon's brigade <b>smashed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> XI Corps on Barlow's Knoll. There, he aided {{the wounded}} {{opposing}} division commander Francis Barlow. This incident {{led to a}} story (which many people consider apocryphal) about the two officers meeting later in Washington, D.C., Gordon unaware that Barlow had survived the battle. The story was told by Barlow and Gordon and published in newspapers and in Gordon's book.|$|E
25|$|One witness {{interviewed by}} the NTSB, a pilot driving on a road {{southwest}} of the airport, told investigators that he saw the airplane in normal flight at normal altitudes, and that {{he believed that the}} approach was not abnormal. The airplane completed a 180-degree turn from the downwind leg of the approach and continued the turn. He then saw the aircraft pitch slightly, before it rolled to the left until the wings were vertical. The airplane then turned nose-down and <b>smashed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ground. He saw no fire or smoke during the flight and he believed both propellers were rotating.|$|E
25|$|On June 20, 1912, the {{government}} survey steamer La Canadienne lost control due to mechanical {{problems in the}} engine room and <b>smashed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> upstream gates of Lock No. 22 of the 3rd Welland Canal, forcing them open by six inches. The resulting surge of water flooded downstream, cresting the upstream gates of Lock No. 21 where five boys were fishing.

25|$|The Hungarians {{crossed the}} river and {{immediately}} attacked the Bohemians, followed by the Swabians under Burchard. Confusing the defenders with a rain of arrows, they plundered the baggage train and made many captives. As Otto received word of the attack, he ordered Conrad to relieve his rear units with a counter-attack. Upon the successful completion of his mission, Conrad returned to the main forces and the King launched an immediate assault. Despite a volley of arrows, Otto's army <b>smashed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Hungarian lines {{and was able to}} fight them in hand-to-hand combat, giving the traditionally nomadic warriors no room to use their preferred shoot-and-run tactics; the Hungarians suffered heavy losses and were forced to retreat in disorder.|$|E
25|$|After the 210 convicts {{were all}} disembarked a fire was {{discovered}} {{on the ship}} at 4.30 pm on 20 May 1814. It was later thought that the fire was caused by candle snuff being dropped on oakum when an officer and boy had entered the hold. It soon {{became apparent that the}} fire could not be fought and so Three Bees was cut loose from her moorings and the other ships in the cove maneuvered to avoid the ship. At 5.30 pm the first gun exploded on board and a swivel ball <b>smashed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> parlour of the house of Captain Piper, hitting only a writing table. The ship drifted onto Bennelong Point and shortly after her magazine exploded. Three Bees was a total loss.|$|E
25|$|The {{accident}} {{caused a}} second green-white-checker {{which began with}} McMurray still leading. On lap 196, an eighth caution flag and third attempt was carried out, as Jimmie Johnson moved up, was clipped by Greg Biffle, and then <b>smashed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> inside wall on the back straightaway. The race was then {{set up for the}} third green-white-checkered with McMurray still the leader on lap 198. At the white flag Harvick was pushing McMurray to the tri-oval. Once they {{were in the middle of}} the tri-oval on the last lap, Harvick got McMurray just loose enough to turn left to get below under his car, but unlike the previous year, McMurray gave Harvick adequate room. Harvick pulled ahead and beat McMurray to the line by 11 one-thousandths (0.011) of a second over McMurray, snapping Harvick's 115 race winless streak.|$|E

25|$|In early August, Banks' corps, {{now part}} of Maj. Gen. John Pope's Army of Virginia, was {{stationed}} at Culpeper, Virginia. With reports of Jackson's Confederate troops marching in their direction, the 46th {{and the rest of}} their brigade under Brig. Gen. Samuel W. Crawford were ordered to attack them near a promontory named Cedar Mountain. Advancing across a wheat field, Crawford's brigade <b>smashed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> left of Jackson's line and collapsed elements of two brigades there, including the vaunted Stonewall Brigade. During the confusion of battle, the 46th split in two directions, with the right half engaging the right flank of the Stonewall Brigade, and the left half tangling with the left end of Brig. Gen. Richard B. Garnett's brigade. The fighting here was close and savage, including hand-to-hand combat. However, with no Union reinforcements immediately sent to sustain this breakthrough, and with pressure from additional Rebel troops sent to shore up and rally this end of the line, Crawford's men were soon outflanked and forced to retreat back across the wheat field.|$|E

25|$|Avdonin, a {{geologist}} by {{trade in the}} Soviet years, was also personally interested in local history and folklore, which in Sverdlovsk had to include {{the murder of the}} Romanovs. Indeed, the Ipatiev House, at 49 Voznesensky Prospekt—the leafy end of the town’s main street—where the family was imprisoned and murdered, was called at the time the House of Special Purpose and maintained for some years afterward as the Museum of the Peoples’ Vengeance. Avdonin gathered information informally for years, and, in 1976, met Soviet writer and filmmaker , who was given information by the son of one of the killers that led them to identify a precise location and to begin informal exhumations. According to the “Yurovsky Note” a primary historical document authored by the commandant of the Ipatiev House and chief executioner Yakov Yurovsky, the bodies (nine of the eleven) were buried at the place where the truck broke down on the second night following the murders, near Grade Crossing 184 on the Koptyaki Road. Pots of acid had been <b>smashed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> pit to consume the naked remains, and railroad ties had been placed over the pit before a layer of earth.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} the Spartans {{realized}} that something unusual was happening {{it was already too}} late. Shortly before the Theban left wing made contact, the Spartans hastily stretched out their right wing in an attempt to outflank and engulf the rapidly approaching Thebans. This was a traditional tactic and, once the Thebans were in range, the stretched wing would then be brought back in an encircling movement. Acting under his own initiative, Pelopidas quickly led the Sacred Band ahead of the Theban left wing to intercept the Spartan maneuver before it could be completed. They succeeded in fixing the Spartans in place until the rest of the Theban heavy infantry finally <b>smashed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Spartan right wing. The sheer number of Thebans overwhelmed the Spartan right wing quickly. The number of Spartan casualties amounted to about 1,000 dead, among whom were 400 Spartiates and their own king. Although some Spartans were in favor of resuming the battle in order to recover the bodies of their dead, the allied perioeci of the Spartan left wing were less than willing to continue fighting (indeed some of them were quite pleased at the turn of events). The remaining polemarchoi eventually decided to request a truce, which the Thebans readily granted. The Spartan dead were returned and a tropaion was set up on the battlefield by the Thebans to commemorate their victory.|$|E
25|$|The seventh {{match of}} the event {{featured}} Ricky Steamboat defending the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against Ric Flair. Terry Funk, Pat O'Connor and Lou Thesz were the special judges in the match in case the match went to the full 1-hour time limit. Flair started the match by performing a Shoulder Block. Flair and Steamboat competed for longer than half hour and exchanged momentum throughout the match. In the final moments of the match, Steamboat delivered a Superplex to Flair and applied a Double Chickenwing but Flair wrapped his legs into the ropes. Flair was <b>smashed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> turnbuckle and Steamboat climbed the top rope. Flair fell into the ropes and Steamboat fell {{down on the floor}} which hurt his leg. Flair suplexed Steamboat back into the ring and began attacking his injured knee. Flair applied a Figure Four Leglock until Steamboat caught the ropes. Flair tried to attack Steamboat's knee but Steamboat delivered a Karate Chop and an Enzuigiri. Steamboat tried to pick Flair to perform a Scoop Slam but his leg was hurt, allowing Flair to pin Steamboat with an Inside Cradle to win the title. After the match, Flair showed respect to Steamboat by shaking hands with him. One of the judges of the match, Terry Funk challenged Flair for the title but Flair turned down the title match, causing Funk to attack Flair and perform a Piledriver on him through the judges table.|$|E
