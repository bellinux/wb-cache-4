40|$|Abstract Background Mongolia’s {{riverine}} {{landscape is}} divided into three watersheds, differing in extent of permafrost, amount of precipitation and in hydrological connectivity between <b>sub-drainages.</b> In order to assess the vulnerability of macroinvertebrate communities to ongoing climate change, we consider the taxonomic and functional structures of stream communities in two major watersheds: The Central Asian Internal Watershed (CAIW) and the Arctic Ocean Watershed (AOW), together covering 86. 1 % of Mongolia’s surface area. We assess the consequences of the hydrological connectivity between <b>sub-drainages</b> on the nestedness and distinctness of the stream communities. And accordingly, we discuss the expected biotic changes to occur in each watershed as a consequence of climate change. Results Gamma and beta diversities were higher in the CAIW than the AOW. High community nestedness was also found in the CAIW along with a higher heterogeneity of macroinvertebrate assemblage structure. Assemblages characteristic of cold headwater streams in the CAIW, were typical of the drainages of the Altai Mountain range. Macroinvertebrate guilds of the CAIW streams exhibited traits reflecting a high stability and low resilience capacity for eutrophication. In contrast, the community of the AOW had lower nestedness and a combination of traits reflecting higher stability and a better resilience capacity to disturbances. Conclusion Higher distinctness of stream communities is due to lower connectivity between the drainages. This was the case of the stream macroinvertebrate communities of the two major Mongolian watersheds, where connectivity of streams between <b>sub-drainages</b> is an important element structuring their communities. Considering differences in the communities’ guild structure, hydrological connectivity and different magnitudes of upcoming impacts of climate change between the two watersheds, respective stream communities will be affected differently. The hitherto different communities will witness an increasing differentiation and divergent adaptations for the upcoming changes. Accordingly, in an increasing awareness to protect Mongolia’s nature, our results encourage adapting conservation planning and management strategies specifically by watershed. </p...|$|R

As part of this effort, we evaluated aspen response to fire in two <b>sub-drainages</b> of the Whitetail Basin three years after treatment. Unburned stands were surveyed to determine whether aspen regeneration was occurring following long term disruption of historical fire return intervals. This information was compared to stem response in nearby burned stands. Regeneration was noted in only one of 40 unburned stands, suggesting aspen stands were declining in this area. Three years after prescribed fire sucker density was significantly higher in the burned stands. This increased the likelihood that stands could regenerate. Based on earlier studies describing suppression of stand regeneration by cattle (Bos taurus) and elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) browsing impacts on aspen sucker height and density were measured in a sub-sample of burned stands. Within {{the first three years}} post-fire big game and the combination of big game and cattle did not affect sucker density in the burned stands. Although sucker height was significantly less in plots used by ungulates it may not be high enough to prevent regeneration. This assertion was supported by sufficient annual growth rates and the recruitment of individual regeneration stems into burned stands. Results from this study indicate that aspen stands can be successfully regenerated in areas where elk numbers are less than 1 animal/km 2 and cattle grazing is closely managed.

40|$|Graduation date: 2002 To {{effectively}} manage for biodiversity at broad, ecosystem scales, {{the influences}} of habitat structure at multiple spatial scales on vertebrate species must be understood. There are few studies on the broad-scale habitat requirements of stream amphibians despite their importance in streams in forest ecosystems in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) as predators and prey, and potentially as indicators of ecosystem health. In particular, studies {{on the influence of}} forest structure at landscape scales on stream amphibians are lacking. I examined stream amphibian-habitat relationships for Pacific giant salamanders (Dicamptodon tenebrosus), larval and metamorphosed tailed frogs (Ascaphus truei), and torrent salamanders (Rhyacotriton spp.) at four spatial scales (2 -m sample unit, intermediate, <b>sub-drainage,</b> and drainage). Over two field seasons (1998 and 1999), I captured 1, 568 amphibians in 702 sample units in 16 randomly chosen drainages in the Oregon Coast Range. I used an information theoretic approach of analysis to rank sets of a priori candidate models that described habitat relationships at each spatial scale. At the 2 -m sample unit scale, all species of interest were negatively associated with fine sediments and were positively associated with either stream width or elevation. At the intermediate spatial scale, Pacific giant salamanders, metamorphosed tailed frogs, and torrent salamanders were positively associated with the presence of a 150 -ft. forested band {{on each side of the}} stream, and larval tailed frogs were positively associated with the presence of forest > 105 years old on at least one side of the stream. At the <b>sub-drainage</b> and drainage scales, all species were positively associated with the proportion of stream length in a <b>sub-drainage</b> or drainage with a 150 -ft. forested band on each side of the stream. Heat load index (aspect) was also important for Pacific giant salamanders and larval tailed frogs at the intermediate and <b>sub-drainage</b> scales. Results at all spatial scales suggest that Pacific giant salamanders and larval tailed frogs occur lower in the drainage network, and metamorphosed tailed frogs and torrent salamanders occur higher in the drainage network. This study demonstrates the importance of examining headwater stream amphibian habitat at multiple spatial scales, provides insights on linkages between amphibian responses across spatial scales, and shows that broad-scale variables (e. g., the presence of forested bands or the percentage of stream length with forested bands) can be used to assess management approaches for stream amphibian communities. Geophysical characteristics such as stream aspect may also help identify areas that should not be harvested if protection of amphibian habitat is an objective...|$|E
40|$|Groundwater age {{and life}} {{expectancy}} probability density functions (pdf) have been defined, and solved {{in a general}} three-dimensional context by means of forward and backward advection–dispersion equations [Cornaton F, Perrochet P. Groundwater age, life expectancy and transit time distributions in advective–dispersive systems; 1. Generalized reservoir theory. Adv Water Res (xxxx) ]. The discharge and recharge zones transit time pdfs were then derived by applying the reservoir theory (RT) to the global system, thus considering as ensemble the union of all inlet boundaries on one hand, and the union of all outlet boundaries on the other hand. The main advantages in using the RT to calculate the transit time pdf is that the outlet boundary geometry does not represent a computational limiting factor (e. g. outlets of small sizes), since the methodology {{is based on the}} integration over the entire domain of each age, or life expectancy, occurrence. In the present paper, we extend the applicability of the RT to <b>sub-drainage</b> basins of groundwater reservoirs by treating the reservoir flow systems as compartments which transfer the water fluxes to a particular discharge zone, and inside which mixing and dispersion processes can take place.

A total number of 36 surface water samples collected from drainage and <b>sub-drainages</b> of River Wainganga in Tahsil Bhandara of Bhandara District, Maharashtra State during 2010 - 11 were analyzed for pH, EC, Fe, Zn and Cu. The pH {{was found in the}} alkaline range (7. 21 - 8. 32), while conductance was obtained in the range of 221 - 3364 µmhos/cm. Fe, Zn and Cu were detected enormously higher than the permissible limit for the samples in the range of 5. 50 - 55. 85, 2. 12 - 39. 18 and 12. 6 - 418. 30 mg/l respectively. Overall seasonal variation was significant for Fe, Zn and Cu. The maximum mean concentration of Fe (55. 85 mg/l) was observed in summer, Zn (39. 18 mg/l) in monsoon.

Foremost among these are basin geomorphology, fluvial and substrate characteristics, stream size, and land use. The primary purpose {{of this investigation was}} to determine if fish assemblages within Kentucky 2 ̆ 7 s Green River and Tradewater River Basins were associated with local scale environmental gradients and, if so, which gradients were the most important in shaping fish assemblages and which fish species were most closely associated with these gradients. A secondary purpose was to determine which regionalization or characterization strategy best segregated streams within the study area according to fish assemblages. Eighty-eight sites within the Green River and Tradewater River Basins were sampled with seine and backpack electroshocker between August 2001 and March 2002. Sampling resulted in the capture of 83 species. A suite of environmental characteristics was estimated or measured at each site. Fish and environmental data were tested for significant relationships with canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Further analyses for the effect of environmental gradients on individual species were done with Pearson correlations. Species data were exposed to detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) to analyze the effect of geographic and local scale classification strategies. CCA analysis indicated there were significant relationships between species and environmental data for both CCA Axis 1 and 2. Further analysis revealed that stream size and substrate composition had the strongest effect in structuring fish assemblages within the study area. Pearson correlations suggested species with special habitat needs were those mainly influenced by local environmental gradients, and thus, were most influential in the structuring offish assemblages. Habitat quality was higher in the eastern portion of the study area where high gradient streams were most common. This may be a reflection of expected upstream to downstream processes or of differing land use due to topography. Larger streams were found to generally support a greater diversity of fish species than smaller streams. DCA analysis of classification strategies indicated fish assemblages best grouped by combinations of hydrologic units (<b>sub-drainages)</b> within the study area. These groupings followed a general east to west trend. Further investigation is needed to separate the effects of natural riverine processes from that of anthropogenic land use...|$|R

40|$|European {{grayling}} of {{the upper}} Vienne River drainage basin represent the westernmost populations inside the natural distribution of the species. Since the 19 th century, their extension across this sub-basin has been dramatically reduced by the harnessing of the river network for dams, initially serving mills but then hydroelectric power generation. Since the 1960 s, local fishing authorities have attempted to compensate for these declines with stocking programs, but the efficiency of these efforts have never been accurately monitored. We aim to evaluate the genetic imprints of these stocking programs and thus provide an indirect measure of the long-term survival of stocked fish. Three target populations were analyzed at both mtDNA (Control Region) and nDNA levels (12 µSats), and compared to populations representative of surrounding drainage basins or fish farm facilities. Among 37 "wild" fish sequenced, only three control region haplotypes were identified, all belonging to the highly divergent Loire basin lineage. Two were specific to the Upper Vienne area, and one was observed in some individuals of the most downstream location, but previously described from the upper Allier <b>sub-drainage.</b> Microsatellite analysis of 87 "wild" fish also demonstrated a rather low diversity within each population (but typical for the Loire drainage) with all Upper Vienne individuals belonging to a single diagnosable unit.

The only piece of evidence of a possible stocking contribution was the occurrence of the Allier haplotype, but it cannot be excluded that this haplotype was also native to this reach of river.

Inoculation with the Earthworm Inoculation Unit technique was at the up-slope end of the field, in the fieldmargins under permanent grass, and inside the four 0. 46 ha plots of the field. The experiment was monitored on three occasions. In 1998 the L. terrestrispopulation had persisted in low numbers only in field and plot margins. By 2003, when the field had been under set-aside grass for three years, density had grown in the margins and L. terrestris were also found inside the field at a very low density. The third monitoring was in autumn 2009, after a further four years as set-aside and a subsequent division of the field into no-till and ploughing management, {{and looked at the}} effects of management (margins, no-till, ploughing), distance from the inoculation and <b>sub-drainage</b> on L. terrestris abundance. The abundance displayed a clear gradient over the field, declining from 14 ind. and 18 g m− 2 at 5 – 9 m from inoculation, to 1 ind. and 2 g m− 2 at 56 – 60 m distance. Margins had the highest abundances (16 ind. and 32 g m− 2), followed by no-till (4 ind. and 4 g m− 2) and ploughing (1 ind. and 1 g m− 2). Abundances were significantly higher above the tiles than between them (P < 0. 05). The results demonstrate the importance of no-till and sub-drain line habitats as settlement supports for the inoculated population. Fieldmargins proved to be decisive for inoculation success, by providing bridgeheads for population establishment and later by acting as source areas for the colonisation of the field. This finding highlights the general importance of fieldmargins in the dispersal ecology of earthworms in arable landscapes...|$|E

Nonpoint source pollution is a generic term for pollutants that come from individual stormwater sewage runoff, disposal systems, erosion road deicing practices and sediment, fertilizer and pesticide use, to name a few.

This is the section of the south branch if the River where the water quality classification changes from Class B to Class C. A great number of reports have been written about water quality throughout the state, nonpoint source pollution and the Pawtuxet River, but none them focus on this section of the river. This study focuses on a specific portion of the river where a worsening water quality problem exists. The report discusses facts and reasons for the water quality problem as it relates to the types nonpoint source pollution and offers solutions and recommendations for possibly alleviating the problem. The recommendations call for the development of best management practices or BMP’s to alleviate the nonpoint source pollution problem.

Creating retention, detention or infiltration basins to filters pollutants from storm runoff. Establishing sewer lines throughout the eastern portion of the Town of alleviate the environmental strain caused by ISDS failure. Establishing programs that inform and educate the public about the River and its problems.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this dissertation consisted in the elaboration of a methodology to determine reservoir groundwater age, life expectancy, and transit time probability distributions in a deterministic manner, considering advective-dispersive transport in steady velocity fields. In the first section, it is shown that by modelling the statistical distribution of groundwater age at aquifer scale {{by means of the}} classical advection-dispersion equation (ADE) for a conservative and non-reactive tracer, associated to proper boundary conditions, the obtained function corresponds to the density of probability of the random variable age, defined as the time elapsed since the water particles entered the aquifer. In a second step, the evaluation of the life expectancy, being the time remaining before a water particle leaves the aquifer was derived from an adjoint backward model, yielding the life expectancy distribution. The convolution of these two distributions (age and life expectancy) is then shown to correspond to the groundwater total transit time distribution, from inlet to outlet, and is fully defined for the entire aquifer domain. From the ADEs simulating the full distributions of age and life expectancy, moment averaged equations are defined, like e. g. the well-known mean age equation. The mathematical models developed in the first section are illustrated by two-dimensional numerical experiments based on a scaled groundwater simulator model. In the second section, the focus is directed towards the reservoir theory (RT). An accurate and efficient method is presented to simulate the transit time distribution at discharge zones. It was shown that for systems with a known internal age probability distribution, the application of the RT to advective-dispersive aquifer systems allows full definition of the discharge zone transit time distribution. The RT can also be applied to internal life expectancy probabilities, yielding the recharge zone life expectancy distribution. One-, two-, and three-dimensional theoretical examples are presented to illustrate the application of the RT in advective-dispersive systems, and make inferences on the effect of boundary conditions, aquifer structure, and macro-dispersion on age, life expectancy and transit time distributions. Also, the particular case of vertically averaged forward and backward ADEs is developed. In the last section, the RT is extended to arbitrary aquifer configurations by subdividing the entire flow system into subsystems, treating each of them as a compartment. Transfer of water fluxes within these compartments from recharge zones to a particular discharge zone could then be considered isolated from any other subsystem. Nevertheless, the effects of mixing and interaction with other compartments and dispersion processes are considered in this approach. In this way, the RT was made applicable to any <b>sub-drainage</b> basin of an aquifer of arbitrary complexity. It was then found that the backward transport of the life expectancy to a specific outlet could predict the forward transport of a contaminant introduced anywhere in space. In other words, the concentration breakthrough curve at any particular outlet, which would result from the transport of a unit mass release at any point can be predicted with only one single realization of the life expectancy field. The usefulness of the elaborated method to deal with environmental settings such as the well-head vulnerability and protection problem, or also the problem of underground storage of high-level nuclear waste, is illustrated on twodimensional synthetic examples. Finally the work is concluded with a brief summary and with a critical view on the obtained results, as well as possible directions for future investigation...|$|E

The potential ecological role this apex predator may have, via trophic cascades, has also received attention in recent years by researchers (e. g., Callan et al. 2013, Kuijper et al. 2013, 2014), wildlife management agencies (e. g., state wolf management plans), as well as the general public. Perhaps nowhere in the western United States has a heightened examination of this large predator been more focused than in Yellowstone National Park (YNP; Laundré et al. 2001, Smith et al. 2003, 2013, Fortin et al. 2005). Here, wolves were reintroduced in the mid- 1990 s, again completing the park 2 ̆ 7 s large predator guild after approximately seven decades of absence, thus providing a long-term, landscape-scale, natural experiment (Diamond 1983). The Gallatin winter range is one of two that occur along the northern portion of YNP, the other is the northern ungulate winter range, or “northern range,” located some 25 km or more to the east. Of these, the Gallatin has been less studied. Nevertheless, the Gallatin winter range, like the northern range, experienced high levels of elk herbivory following the extirpation of wolves in the early 1900 s. Over a period of approximately seven decades, intensive herbivory by elk led to the long-term decline in aspen (Populus tremuloides) and willow (Salix spp.) recruitment (i. e., growth of young plants above the browse level of elk) in the Gallatin winter range, leaving these plant communities in an impoverished condition (Lovaas 1967, Patten 1968, Kay 2001, Ripple and Beschta 2004, Halofsky and Ripple 2008). Accelerated soil and channel erosion also occurred (Lovaas 1967, Beschta and Ripple 2006). Thus, when wolves were reintroduced into Yellowstone in the mid- 1990 s, aspen recruitment within the Gallatin elk winter range, had been largely absent for several decades (Kay 2001, Halofsky and Ripple 2008). In 2010, Winnie (2012) sampled 65 aspen stands in the northwestern corner of YNP, within the Gallatin elk winter range, to determine if a behaviorally mediated trophic cascade (BMTC) was occurring. As background information Winnie (2012 : 2600) included only a single sentence about wolves in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem and the remainder of the paragraph briefly discussed elk numbers, with most of the emphasis on elk in YNP 2 ̆ 7 s northern range where there has been a pronounced redistribution of elk since the reintroduction of wolves (White et al. 2012). A more complete summary regarding the status and dynamics of wolves and elk over the last 15 years (i. e., 1995 – 2010) in the Gallatin elk winter range, {{as well as in the}} Daly Creek <b>sub-drainage</b> where Winnie 2 ̆ 7 s study occurred, would have helped readers better understand the context of his study. Furthermore, information regarding human harvest of elk in the Gallatin winter range since the return of wolves, or whether such hunting has been affecting elk numbers or distribution in recent years was not provided. As part of his 2010 field study, Winnie (2012) characterized the presence or absence of several hypothesized risk factors (independent variables) for each aspen stand, including escape impediments, visual impediments, distance to conifer forest edge, and presence of deadfall trees. For dependent variables, Winnie (2012) recorded the presence or absence of browsing on aspen suckers (ramets 3 ̆c 2 m in height) and the number of aspen juveniles (plants 3 ̆e 2 m in height but 3 ̆c 6 cm in diameter at breast height). A height of 2 m generally represents the upper browse level of elk, and young aspen exceeding this height are considered to have successfully recruited. Such recruitment would represent a major departure from the browsing suppression that occurred in his study area over recent decades (Kay 2001, Halofsky and Ripple 2008) and an indication that a tri-trophic cascade involving wolves, elk, and aspen may be underway. From the results of his analyses, Winnie (2012 : 2600) concluded that “aspen were not responding to hypothesized fine-scale risk factors in ways consistent with the current BMTC hypothesis. ” We respectfully submit that the design and analysis used to support such a conclusion may be deficient for two reasons, the first based on conceptual concerns and the second on statistical concerns. (1) Unfortunately, some aspen stands Winnie (2012) sampled contained juveniles associated with “physical barriers,” barriers that could prevent elk from browsing young aspen. To be scientifically valid, a risk assessment using young aspen as the dependent variable must inherently assure that all evaluated plants were accessible to elk browsing. (2) The inclusion of 10 aspen stands containing some physically protected aspen likely confounded results from his predation risk analyses (i. e., Figs. 5, 6, and 7 in Winnie 2012). While the inclusion of stands with protected aspen may increase the variance associated with his dependent variables (i. e., browsing rate, number of juveniles), the fallacy of doing so is revealed by inspecting these variables for the 85...|$|E
