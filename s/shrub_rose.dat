50|$|This hybrid nutkana is a <b>shrub</b> <b>rose</b> with large, single flowers, five-petalled but {{sometimes}} with another one or two, reaching an average diameter of 8 cm. Their colour is light to carmine-pink {{with a large}} circle of yellow stamens. The long-lasting flowers are moderately fragrant, develop from small, pointed buds, and appear in small clusters of two to five on short strong stems in a spring or summer flush with some scattered flowers later on. In autumn, the shrub sports rose hips.|$|E
5000|$|The tall <b>shrub</b> <b>rose</b> {{or a small}} climber grows {{upright and}} bushy, {{reaching}} 100 to 365 cm (39" [...] to 12) height and about 1.8 m width. It has very sturdy, dense, dark green foliage with large, semi-glossy leaves, and almost no prickles. It is winter hardy (USDA zone 5b through 9b), heat and rain tolerant, and very disease resistant, but needs a good nutrient supply and enough sun. In half shade the cultivar is less floriferous. It can be grown as solitary shrub or in groups, in containers or as standard rose to 90 cm (3 ft) high, and is very well suited for cut flowers. Due to its bowing flower heads, training the rose as a small climber along a fence or other supports is recommended.|$|E
50|$|The {{vigorous}} {{plant is}} a small climber or a tall <b>shrub</b> <b>rose,</b> reaching 1.5 to 2.5 meters height (5 to 8) at a width of 1.5 m (5), but needs {{a few years to}} grow to its final height, as the cultivars puts more energy into its many flowers. As a climber, the cultivar can be trained to reach heights of up to 4.5 m. The dense shrub has long arching shoots with a reddish colour, very few prickles, and many soft, glossy leaves. The foliage is medium to dark grey green with crimson veins. Blush Noisette tolerates half shade, is disease resistant and heat tolerant, but not hardy in severe winters (USDA zone 7) and the flowers are easily damaged by rain. It can be grown solitary, in dense hedges, or with some support be trained as a climber and is well suited for obelisk trellises.|$|E
5000|$|Thomas became {{partner at}} Sunningdale Nurseries - then the most revered nursery {{in the country}} - with Jim Russell. The {{partners}} became known for planting schemes that focused on form and foliage, as much as flowers. At Sunningdale, Thomas established his entire collection of roses. It was here also that he began introducing new or rediscovered garden plants - notable introductions from this period include the perennial Geranium 'Claridge Druce'. While Thomas would become associated with many other projects, he would remain {{a director of the}} Sunningdale nursery until 1971.Thomas's first important publication about roses was a booklet called The Manual of <b>Shrub</b> <b>Roses,</b> describing all the varieties, with advice on cultivation. In the foreword he described the booklet's aim as: [...] "To bring forth these lovely things from retirement." [...] His classic books on <b>roses</b> - Old <b>Shrub</b> <b>Roses</b> (1955), <b>Shrub</b> <b>Roses</b> Of Today (1962) and Climbing Roses Old And New (1965) followed and cemented his influence. They also provided much-needed information about the history and extent of the genus at a time when old varieties were being overshadowed by their repeat flowering and showier cousins hybrid teas and floribundas.|$|R

5000|$|The {{first of}} the gardens, the [...] "Upper Walled Garden", was planted with {{historical}} varieties of <b>shrub</b> <b>roses</b> {{and a collection of}} Chinese and Japanese peonies. It is mainly planted with flowering shrubs including Echium, Watsonia, Acanthus, Daphniphyllum, Acradenia, Arbutus, Cornus, Iris, Eryngium, Beschorneria and ornamental bananas.|$|R
5000|$|Ever since then, roses {{have served}} as the primary {{flowering}} plants in the garden, including large numbers of [...] "Queen Elizabeth" [...] grandiflora roses, along with the tea roses [...] "Pascale", [...] "Pat Nixon", and [...] "King's Ransom". A <b>shrub</b> <b>rose,</b> [...] "Nevada Rose", also serves to add a cool note of white coloration to the landscaping. Seasonal flowers are further interspersed to add nearly year-round color and variety to the garden. Some of the Spring blooming bulbs planted in the present-day Rose Garden include jonquil, daffodil, fritillaria, grape hyacinth, tulips, chionodoxa and squill. Summer blooming annuals are changed on a near yearly basis. In the fall, chrysanthemum and flowering kale bring color leading {{all the way up}} until the early winter days. In something of a decidedly odd tradition, each and every summer sees garden gnomes taken and placed throughout the Rose Garden on July 1st - the number of which representing the number of living presidents at that particular moment in time.|$|E
50|$|The formal gardens cover {{an area of}} 12 acre. The visitor {{approaches}} the hall and gardens along an avenue of pleached lime trees which are clipped each year. The main path passes under the Clock Tower (see below) and a path on the right leads into the Flag Garden, so-called because its paths are formed from flagstones. This leads to the Furlong Drive, a straight path leading in a southwesterly direction from {{the house to the}} Sundial Circle, which is exactly a furlong (220 yd) in length. Parkland lies on the southeast side of the path, and this is separated from the formal gardens by the ha-ha. To the north of this path is the double Herbaceous Border, {{which was one of the}} first in England. It consists of four pairs of flowerbeds which are backed on one side by a 19th-century wall and on the other by a yew hedge.

To the south of the herbaceous border is the Ilex Avenue which consists of seven pairs of holm oaks clipped into the shape of cylinders 8 m high and 3 m in diameter. In the angle between the Herbaceous Border and the Ilex Avenue is the <b>Shrub</b> <b>Rose</b> Garden.At the southwest end of the Furlong Drive is the Sundial Circle, which contains a sundial surrounded by a lawn and borders of shrub-roses and other flowering shrubs. From the Sundial Circle a path leads into an area known as the Rootree. This was created in the 19th century as an alpine rock garden but since 1960 it has been planted with flowering shrubs. From the Rootery paths lead to the Fish Garden, a small sunken garden containing a pond, and to the Rough, a semi-wild area. From the north end of the Ilex Avenue a gate leads into the Walled Garden. This was formerly one of the kitchen gardens and was redesigned in 1960. It contains a pond surrounded by statues of four heraldic beasts which were originally on the roof of the house. In the centre of the pond is a modern flower sculpture designed by Tom Leaper. This garden also contains lawns, trees and shrubs. To its east is the Kitchen Garden, where vegetables as well as flowers and crab apples are grown. To the east of the Kitchen Garden are two small gardens, the Herb Garden and the Scented Garden, the former containing herbs and the latter strongly scented flowers and shrubs.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{entrance}} to the grounds is through an arch over which is the 19th-century Clock Tower. The clock it contains has only one hand.

40|$|The {{aesthetic}} {{value of}} an ornamental plant is highly dependant on its shape. This is primarily determined by the characteristics of its axes at the following levels: (1) morphological (size of the different constituent elements) (2) topological (branching relationships) and (3) spatial (position of the axes in space). Architectural analysis therefore {{appears to be an}} interesting method for characterising plant shape and for assessing its aesthetic value. This method seems to be particularly well adapted to an ornamental shrub such as the rose bush that has a visibly complex architecture. The analysis took place on two cultivars of the <b>shrub</b> <b>rose</b> Rosa hybrida, Knock Out® cv Radrazz and Lovely Meilland® cv Meiratcan. Quantitative experimental data (morphological and topological) were obtained on plants grown from metamers cuttings in a greenhouse for five months. Fifteen plants per cultivar were fully described. Data was analysed using the Multi Tree Scale method (MTG) (Godin C. and Caraglio Y. 1998). This method made it possible to obtain a database for each cultivar that included the different related architectural scale levels, morphological entities and variables (attributes). By analysing this database, we were able to clearly identify the dominant architectural elements common to the two cultivars, such as the existence of two types of axes (long and short) and the position of these axes according to branching order. Moreover, it also allowed us to identify the architectural characteristics that differentiate the two genotypes, such as the number of branching orders, the number of flower-bearing branches and their length. This precise and quantitative analysis of shrub architecture is a powerful method for describing shrub shape. It may therefore be an invaluable tool for breeders, for example, who want to accurately characterise the architecture of different genotypes in order to impose selection pressure on objective criteria. The same is true for the researcher who would like to assess the effect of various treatments on plant shape, such {{as in the case of}} pruning or the application of a growth regulator...|$|E
40|$|The larval {{stages of}} the cynipid wasp Diplolepis rosaefolii induce the {{formation}} of single-chambered, lenticular galls on {{the leaves of the}} wild <b>shrub</b> <b>rose,</b> Rosa virginiana. The development of galls induced by D. rosaefolii was studied using light and scanning electron microscopy. The gall consists of four tissue layers, which surround a centrally located larval chamber. These include an outermost dermal layer, underlying parenchyma, sclerenchyma, and nutritive tissue. Development in the D. rosaefolii galls involves a number of characteristics that are unique to this gall and differ markedly from development in other Diplolepis galls studied. These characteristics include the presence of double sclerenchymal layers and vascularization embedded between the sclerenchyma. Periclistus is an inquiline in the galls induced by D. rosaefolii. Under the influence of Periclistus larvae, a number of morphological changes, including {{an increase in the number}} of larval chambers, are observed in the galls. Changes in tissue type, proportion, and overall morphology exhibited by Periclistus-modified galls are also studied using conventional light microscopy techniques.
