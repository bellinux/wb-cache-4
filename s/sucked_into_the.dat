5|$|Shin Megami Tensei If... is a Japanese {{role-playing}} {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Atlus in 1994 for the Super Famicom. It is a spin-off from the Shin Megami Tensei series, itself {{part of the larger}} Megami Tensei franchise. Since release, it has been ported to mobile devices, the PlayStation and Microsoft Windows, and re-released digitally through Nintendo's Virtual Console service. The story follows a student of Karukozaka High School after their school is <b>sucked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> realm of demons by a vengeful student's demon summoning spell going wrong.|$|E
5|$|Isopods have {{a simple}} gut which lacks a midgut section; instead there are caeca {{connected}} {{to the back of}} the stomach in which absorption takes place. Food is <b>sucked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> esophagus, a process enhanced in the blood-sucking parasitic species, and passed by peristalsis into the stomach, where the material is processed and filtered. The structure of the stomach varies, but in many species there is a dorsal groove into which indigestible material is channelled and a ventral part connected to the caeca where intracellular digestion and absorption take place. Indigestible material passes on through the hindgut and is eliminated through the anus, which is on the pleotelson.|$|E

5|$|Sandgrouse are gregarious, feeding in {{flocks of}} up to 100 birds. As a {{consequence}} of their dry diet, they need to visit water sources regularly. Drinking times vary among the species. Ten species drink at dawn, four at dusk and two at indeterminate times. When drinking, water is <b>sucked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> beak which is then raised to let the water flow down into the crop. By repeating this procedure rapidly, enough water to last twenty four hours can be swallowed in a few seconds. As they travel to water holes, they call to {{members of their own}} species and many hundreds or thousands synchronise their arrival at the drinking site despite converging from many different locations scattered over hundreds of square miles (kilometres) of territory.|$|E
5|$|The Pearl and the Dutchman {{battle in}} the maelstrom. Elizabeth and Will are wed by Barbossa before {{swinging}} over to the Dutchman to aid Jack. On board the Dutchman, Jones and Jack engage in a duel, with Jones gaining the upper hand. Jones stabs Will with a sword, causing Bootstrap to fly into a rage and attack Jones. Jones begins to gain the upper hand, but Jack and Elizabeth help Will stab Jones' heart. Jones falls into the maelstrom, while Will succumbs to his injuries. Jack and Elizabeth escape the Dutchman as it is <b>sucked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> maelstrom, while {{the crew of the}} Dutchman converge on Will, led by Bootstrap.|$|E
5|$|In most of {{the class}} Enopla ("armed"), the {{proboscis}} exits from a common orifice of the rhynchocoel and mouth. A typical member of this class has a stylet, a calcareous barb, with which the animal stabs the prey many times to inject toxins and digestive secretions. The prey is then swallowed whole or, after partial digestion, its tissues are <b>sucked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mouth. The stylet is attached about one-third of distance {{from the end of}} the ed proboscis, which extends only enough to expose the stylet. On either side of the active stylet are sacs containing back-up stylets to replace the active one as the animal grows or an active one is lost. Instead of one stylet, the Polystilifera have a pad that bears many tiny stylets, and these animals have separate orifices for the proboscis and mouth, unlike other Enopla. The Enopla can only attack after contacting the prey.|$|E

5|$|The Parrs {{escape and}} travel to Metroville in a spare rocket. True to its programming, the Omnidroid recognizes Syndrome as an {{opponent}} and attacks the remote on his wrist, making him incapable of controlling it, while simultaneously knocking him unconscious. The Parrs and Frozone team up {{to fight the}} Omnidroid; the battle is indecisive until Bob comes across the remote, allowing him to control one of the robot's arms {{and use it to}} destroy it's power source. Returning home, the Parrs find Syndrome, who plans to kidnap and raise Jack-Jack as his own sidekick to exact revenge on the family. As Syndrome tries to escape to his airplane, Jack-Jack's own superpowers start to manifest, and he eludes Syndrome's grasp. Bob and Helen rescue Jack-Jack, in the process causing Syndrome to be <b>sucked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> jet's turbine by his cape, where he is killed.|$|E
5|$|Clark, Chloe, and Pete {{arrive at}} the dance, and say their goodbyes to Whitney before he leaves for training. The weather begins to deteriorate, and a storm picks up, as Lana takes Whitney to the bus stop. Jonathan (John Schneider) and Martha (Annette O'Toole) decide {{to head to the}} storm cellar to seek cover from the storm, and they {{discover}} Nixon just as the octagonal disk activates the ship. Nixon attempts to escape with the videotape, and Jonathan chases out into the storm after him. The ship levitates off the ground and flies out of the storm cellar. Lana says goodbye to Whitney and drives home. On her way, storm winds force her off the road, right next to three tornadoes that have touched down. The students at the dance are alerted to the tornados that have been sighted, and Clark races off to make sure Lana is all right. The three tornadoes merge into one large tornado and move in Lana's direction. Clark arrives just as Lana, in the truck, is <b>sucked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> tornado's vortex; Clark speeds into the tornado to rescue her.|$|E

5|$|Carolyn Porco of NASA was {{consulted}} on {{the planetary}} science and imagery. The animators realistically recreated what an explosion {{would look like}} in space: short blasts, which suck inward and leave debris from a ship floating. For shots of an imploding planet, the same explosion program was used to simulate it breaking up, while the animators could manually composite multiple layers of rocks and wind <b>sucking</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> planet. Unlike other Star Trek films and series, the transporter beam effects swirl rather than speckle. Abrams conceived the redesign to emphasize the notion of transporters as beams that can pick up and move people, rather than a signal composed of scrambled atoms.|$|R
