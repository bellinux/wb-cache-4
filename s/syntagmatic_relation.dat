40|$|Abstract—Lexical relations, or {{semantic}} {{relations of}} words, are useful knowledge fundamental to all applications since they help to capture inherent semantic variations of vocabulary in human languages. Discovering such knowledge in a robust way from arbitrary text data {{is a significant}} challenge in big text data mining. In this paper, we propose a novel general probabilistic approach based on random walks on word adjacency graphs to systematically mine two fundamental and complementary lexical relations, i. e., paradigmatic and <b>syntagmatic</b> <b>relations</b> between words from arbitrary text data. We show that representing text data as an adjacency graph opens up many opportunities to define interesting random walks for mining lexical relation patterns, and propose specific random walk algorithms for min-ing paradigmatic and <b>syntagmatic</b> <b>relations.</b> Evaluation results on multiple corpora show that the proposed random walk-based algorithms can discover meaningful paradigmatic and <b>syntagmatic</b> <b>relations</b> of words from text data.

40|$|The {{concept of}} mark, {{borrowed}} from phonology and formulated by N. S. Troubetzkoy and R. Jakobson in the nineteen-thirties, is {{significant in the}} definition of the syntactic functions of terms having a sequential <b>syntagmatic</b> <b>relation.</b> The application of this concept (cf. G. H. Greenberg (1966), N. Chomsky and M. Halle (1968), and H.

The structural markers therefore determine the limits of the specific intonations of lexical units and their morphological occurrences, and thus give information about the functions they take on in an argument- structure. In this article we shall try to illustrate the syntactic realisation of this concept in Arabic, proceeding through the following stages: we shall first begin with an outline of the concept of mark in order to understand how it works syntactically. Then we shall examine how the Arab grammatical tradition has approached case marking and the function of subject. This will then lead us to redefine the subject in terms of mark and to identify it as an archi-function marked compulsorily in the nominative whatever the structure of the argument-structure in which it occurs.

This paper was intended to investigate the development of mental lexicon through a psycholinguistic experiment and more specifically, to explore the possible role L 2 language proficiency may have in word association behaviors of Iranian EFL learners. To this end, a standardized English placement test (OPT) and a word association test were administered to 120 undergraduate EFL learners. The elicited responses were classified based on Peppard's (2007) model and then analyzed in terms of the frequency of each type of word association. The results indicated that upper intermediate students' responses were significantly more frequent than beginners' responses in the categories of "Synonymy" and "Hypernymy and Hyponymy" which are paradigmatic relations and the beginners' responses were significantly more frequent in the category of "Grammatical collocation" which is a <b>syntagmatic</b> <b>relation.</b> These findings, which support McCarthy (1990) and Meara (1982), are not in line with Wolter’(2001) belief about the re-evaluation of the syntagmatic-paradigmatic shift in the case of nonnative speakers.

40|$|Recent work on {{parametric}} {{approaches to}} the study of interlinguistic variation 8 and universals of grammar has drawn {{a great deal of attention}} to what to many appears to be one of the most basic cases of parametric variation, the position of the head element within a constituent. Many of the syntactic differences between languages are thought to derive from (in the typological tradition: to correlate with) the placement of head elements, while language acquisition is seen to rely heavily on algorithms for selecting the correct parameter settings on the basis of fairly limited evidence (cf. e. g. Gibson and Wexler 1992 and Clark 1990 for some of the issues that arise here). In morphology, a similar wave of interest in the position of the head can be seen, due mainly to Williams ' (1981) proposal of a Right-Hand Head Rule. The goal of this paper is to consider some of the issues that arise in parameter-setting accounts of word-order variation and the acquisition of word-order. My main point is that a language may have not one but several basic patterns for a single domain (say word-order within the clause, or order within compounds), and that the main task for the acquisition device may therefore be much more complex than just the selection of a parameter value from a limited set of possibilities. But before making this point, and illustrating it with examples drawn from a variety of languages, I will digress a bit and first talk about what it means to be a head. 2. What's the head? The notion 'head ' has a good many definitions (see e. g. Zwicky 1984 for an overview and detailed discussion). I will just mention four.

In Chapter 1 the problem, aims and the method were established In Chapter 2 a survey of the general bibliography on the subject was given. This study is mainly structural of nature, but preliminary remarks about the T. G. G. on the subject were also taken into account. A broad discussion an the structural view was given In terms of General Linguistics as applied to the African languages. In Chapter 3 language structure and language system was discussed in order to establish a framework wherein the compound could be studied according to the different language disciplines. In Chapter 4 the position of the compound in relation to the other language symbols were established by applying the different word tests of Van Wyk. After it was established that the compound is a word, the linguistic disciplines for example morphology, syntax, semantics and phonology, were appalled in order to describe the compound scientifically. In Chapter 5 the compound was studied morphologically. Its different morphemes were identified. This was followed by describing the syntactic structures o f the compound. It was established that the underlying structure of the compound is a word group. In this process {{it was found that the}} syntactic processes, for example reduction and substitution played a major role In the establishment of the compound. In Chapter 6 the semantics of the compound was studied. Paradigmatic and syntagmatic semantic characteristics of the compound in Northern Sotho were identified. It was established that the paradigmatic semantic characteristics of word correlates are inhibited by the <b>syntagmatic</b> <b>relation</b> in order to bring about an unambiguous interpretation. The metaphor was found t o be even more profound in compounds than in non-compounded words. In Chapter 7 the phonological aspects of the compound were discussed. It was discovered that occlusivation played a major role in the establishment of the compound. In Chapter 8 the statistics of 2472 compounds which were compiled in the appendix, were given. It was found that the noun and the verb stem were the most productive components in the formation of compounds. A summary and conclusions were given in Chapter 9. The conclusion was reached that the compound certainly has a place in the language system and that it belongs to the sub-system of the word on grounds of its morphological, syntactic, semantic and phonological characteristics.

40|$|The German nominal group - {{even when}} {{reduced to the}} core {{inventory}} of nouns, determiners and attributive adjectives - is a morphologically and syntactically complex structure. In this paper {{it is suggested that}} a detailed understanding of the (morpho-) syntactic categories and the <b>syntagmatic</b> <b>relations</b> exhibited in the core nominal group is a prerequisite to an adequate analysis. It will be argued that the two fundamental <b>syntagmatic</b> <b>relations</b> holding with the nominal group, viz. Government and Agreement, have to figure as theoretically primitive concepts in any reasonably detailed account of nominal structures. Explicating government and agreement relations and especially separating one from the other, will presuppose a sufficient inventory of formal descriptive devices in any particular theory of grammar. The paper is settled in the framework of Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG). Recent HPSG analyses for the German nominal group that have been put forth in [Pollard and Sag 1994] and [Netter 1994] are studied in detail contrasting them to (semi-) formal proposals from other linguistic frameworks; potential problems as well as some abstract joint properties of the two HPSG approaches are exemplified. Building on this comparison it is concluded that in exactly the linguistic stipulations shared by the two accounts, two important generalizations about the inherent structure of the German nominal group are to be found. At the same time the [Pollard and Sag 1994] analysis is tentatively reformulated. (orig.)

The Sketch Engine system represents itself a corpus tool which takes as input a corpus of any language and corresponding grammar patterns. The system gives information about a word’s collocability on concrete dependency models, and generates lists of the most frequent phrases for a given word based on appropriate models.
