5|$|Limnoperdon is a fungal genus in the {{monotypic}} family Limnoperdaceae. The genus is also monotypic, as {{it contains}} a single species, the aquatic fungus Limnoperdon incarnatum. The species, described as new to science in 1976, produces fruit bodies that lack specialized structures such as a <b>stem,</b> <b>cap</b> and gills common in mushrooms. Rather, the fruit bodies—described as aquatic or floating puffballs—are small balls (0.5–1mm diameter) of loosely interwoven hyphae. The balls float {{on the surface of}} the water above submerged twigs. Experimental observations on the development of the fruit body, based on the growth on the fungus in pure culture, suggest that a thin strand of mycelium tethers the ball above water while it matures. Fruit bodies start out as a tuft of hyphae, then become cup-shaped, and eventually enclose around a single chamber that contains reddish spores. Initially discovered in a marsh in the state of Washington, the fungus has since been collected in Japan, South Africa, and Canada.|$|E
40|$|Oyster {{mushroom}} (Plerotus spp.) are edible mushrooms {{with high}} diversity. Cultivated oyster mushroom isolates in Indonesia are from local isolates {{as well as}} from outside Indonesia. Report on their genetic diversity are still scarce especially on their molecular aspects. This study was aimed to identify genetic diversity and product qualities of several local and domestic isolates. Molecular analysis onPlerotus spp. isolates were done by using RAPD molecular marker with five primers (RP- 2, RP- 3 RP- 3, RP- 4 and RP- 6), and qualities product were observed based on number and length <b>stem,</b> <b>cap</b> diameter, wet weight of frutting body and biological eficience. The results indicated that isolates HHB 327, Sp 1, Sp 2, Sp 3, Sp 4 and Sp 5 (white color Pleurotus) can be considered as one group with perfect (100 %) similarity index. These six isolates group with isolate HHB 307 (the color not determined) had similarity index of 81, 9 %. The similar results were shown by HHB 215 and Sp 6 (brown color Pleurotus) isolates which both can be considered as one group with perfect similarity index. This latter group form larger group with HHB 328 (brown color Pleurotus) at 90 % similarity index, and this group with isolate HHB 247 (pink color Pleurotus) had a similarity index of 81, 9 %. Isolate HHB 247 showed highest product qualities...|$|E
40|$|Strawberries {{harvested}} {{for processing}} as frozen fruits are currently de-calyxed manually in the field. This process requires {{the removal of}} the <b>stem</b> <b>cap</b> with green leaves (i. e. the calyx) and incurs many disadvantages when performed by hand. Not only does it necessitate the need to maintain cutting tool sanitation, but it also increases labor time and exposure of the de-capped strawberries before in-plant processing. This leads to labor inefficiency and decreased harvest yield. By moving the calyx removal process from the fields to the processing plants, this new practice would reduce field labor and improve management and logistics, while increasing annual yield. As labor prices continue to increase, the strawberry industry has shown great interest in {{the development and implementation of}} an automated calyx removal system. In response, this dissertation describes the design, operation, and performance of a full-scale automatic vision-guided intelligent de-calyxing (AVID) prototype machine. The AVID machine utilizes commercially available equipment to produce a relatively low cost automated de-calyxing system that can be retrofitted into existing food processing facilities. This dissertation is broken up into five sections. The first two sections include a machine overview and a 12 -week processing plant pilot study. Results of the pilot study indicate the AVID machine is able to de-calyx grade- 1 -with-cap conical strawberries at roughly 66 percent output weight yield at a throughput of 10, 000 pounds per hour. The remaining three sections describe in detail the three main components of the machine: a strawberry loading and orientation conveyor, a machine vision system for calyx identification, and a synchronized multi-waterjet knife calyx removal system. In short, the loading system utilizes rotational energy to orient conical strawberries. The machine vision system determines cut locations through RGB real-time feature extraction. The high-speed multi-waterjet knife system uses direct drive actuation to locate 30, 000 psi cutting streams to precise coordinates for calyx removal. Based on the observations and studies performed within this dissertation, the AVID machine is seen to be a viable option for automated high-throughput strawberry calyx removal. A summary of future tasks and further improvements is discussed at the end...|$|E

40|$|Riboswitches are RNA {{elements}} that control gene expression through metabolite binding. The preQ 1 riboswitch exhibits the smallest known ligand-binding domain and {{is of interest}} for its economical organization and high affinity interactions with guanine-derived metabolites required to confer tRNA wobbling. Here we present the crystal structure of a preQ 1 aptamer domain in complex with its precursor metabolite preQ 0. The structure is highly compact with a core that features a <b>stem</b> <b>capped</b> by a well organized decaloop. The metabolite is recognized within a deep pocket via Watson-Crick pairing with C 15. Additional hydrogen bonds are made to invariant bases U 6 and A 29. The ligand-bound state confers continuous helical stacking throughout the core fold, thus providing a platform to promote Watson-Crick base pairing between C 9 of the decaloop and the first base of the ribosome-binding site, G 33. The structure offers insight into the mode of ribosome-binding site sequestration by a minimal RNA fold stabilized by metabolite binding and has implications for understanding the molecular basis by which bacterial genes are regulated...|$|R

40|$|The {{coronavirus}} {{spike protein}} (S) forms the distinctive virion surface structures that are characteristic of this viral family, appearing in negatively stained electron microscopy as <b>stems</b> <b>capped</b> with spherical bulbs. These structures are essential for the initiation of infection through attachment of the virus to cellular receptors followed by fusion to host cell membranes. The S protein can also mediate the formation of syncytia in infected cells. The S protein is a type I transmembrane protein that is very large compared to other viral fusion proteins, and all except a short carboxy-terminal segment of the S molecule constitutes the ectodomain. For the prototype coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), it has previously been established that S protein assembly into virions is specified by the carboxy-terminal segment, which comprises the transmembrane domain and the endodomain. We have genetically dissected these domains in the MHV S protein to localize the determinants of S incorporation into virions. Our results establish that assembly competence maps to the endodomain of S, which was shown to be sufficient to target a heterologous integral membrane protein for incorporation into MHV virions. In particular, mutational analysis indicated a major role for the charge-rich carboxy-terminal region of the endodomain. Additionally, {{we found that the}} adjacent cysteine-rich region of the endodomain is critical for fusion of infected cells, confirming results previously obtained with S protein expression systems...|$|R

40|$|Autosomal {{dominant}} dyskeratosis congenita (DKC) {{has been}} linked to mutations in the RNA component of telomerase, the ribonucleoprotein responsible for telomere maintenance. Recent studies have investigated the role of the GC (107 – 108) → AG mutation in the conserved P 3 helix in the pseudoknot domain of human telomerase RNA. The mutation was found to significantly destabilize the pseudoknot conformation, resulting in a shift in the thermodynamic equilibrium to favor formation of a P 2 b hairpin intermediate. In the wild-type sequence, the hairpin intermediate was found to form a novel sequence of pyrimidine base pairs in a continuous <b>stem</b> <b>capped</b> by a structured pentaloop. The DKC mutant hairpin was observed to be slightly more stable than the wild-type hairpin, further shifting the pseudoknot-hairpin equilibrium to favor the mutant P 2 b hairpin. Here we examined the solution structure of the DKC mutant hairpin to identify the reason for this additional stability. We found that the mutant hairpin forms the same stem structure as wild-type and that the additional stabilization observed using optical melting {{can be explained by the}} formation of a YNMG-type tetraloop structure, with the last nucleotide of the pentaloop bulged out into the major groove. Our results provide a structural explanation for the increased stability of the mutant hairpin and further our understanding of the effect of this mutation on the structure and stability of the dominant conformation of the pseudoknot domain in this type of DKC...|$|R

50|$|A {{much more}} active {{approach}} to monitoring tire pressures involves retrofitting a tire pressure monitor to your vehicle. Vehicles manufactured after model year 2007 {{are required to}} have tire pressure monitoring systems built-in, although many older vehicles might not have it. Tire rack, for example, offers aftermarket tire pressure monitors from various companies, including one that notifies {{the driver of the}} tire pressure in each wheel, as well as exactly which tire the system is displaying the pressure of. A much less expensive way to monitor tire pressures is to install valve <b>stem</b> <b>caps</b> that alert the driver to low tire pressure. These work by first setting the pressure on the cap matching the pressure you desire your tires to be at. Once installed on the tire's valve stem, the tip of these caps will change color (from green, to yellow, to red) when the tire becomes under-inflated. The benefit of this system is its low initial cost, but its disadvantages include questionable accuracy (even more so if the caps aren't tightened down enough) and {{that the only way to}} monitor them is from outside of the vehicle, looking directly at the cap. It's always a good idea to have a quality, reliable tire gauge on hand regardless of what system is installed in your vehicle, and to either check tire pressures yourself of by having someone else do it, as most tire pressure monitor systems will not alert the driver until the tire pressure falls below a certain amount, usually 20% below the recommended pressure.|$|R
