5|$|The {{birth of}} her {{daughter}} in September 1857, however, began to reduce the level of her activism. Stone had made preliminary arrangements for the 1857 national convention {{to be held in}} Providence, but because she {{would not be able to}} attend it, <b>she</b> <b>handed</b> responsibility to Susan B. Anthony and Thomas Wentworth Higginson. When the Panic of 1857 disrupted Anthony’s plan to move the convention to Chicago, Stone made the announcement that the next National Woman’s Rights Convention would be in May 1858. Anthony helped Stone arrange the 1858 convention and then took sole responsibility for the 1859 meeting. Elizabeth Cady Stanton took charge of the 1860 convention.|$|E

25|$|The bandit's {{most famous}} exploit {{occurred}} {{early in his}} career in 1944—the robbery of the Duchess of Pratameno. He and his men sneaked into her estate unnoticed, and Giuliano was in her salon before she knew what was occurring.

After <b>she</b> <b>handed</b> the loot over, he took a diamond ring from her hand, which he wore {{for the rest of his}} life, and borrowed John Steinbeck's “In Dubious Battle” from her library before leaving (which was returned with a respectful note a week later).

25|$|Established in 1968 by Coretta Scott King, The King Center is the {{official}} memorial dedicated {{to the advancement of}} the legacy and ideas of Martin Luther King, Jr., leader of a nonviolent movement for justice, equality and peace.

King had a group of supporters begin gathering her husband's papers in 1967, the year before his death. After raising funds from a private sector and the government, she financed the building of the complex in 1981.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, {{the rebel}} {{remnants}} of the Song court fled to Fuzhou. Emperor Gong was left behind as the empress dowager submitted to Bayan, horrified by reports of the total slaughter of Changzhou. Before the capital was taken, Empress Dowager Xie (1208–1282) made attempts to negotiate with Bayan, promising annual tribute to the Yuan dynasty, but he rejected these proposals. After her attempts at diplomacy had failed, <b>she</b> <b>handed</b> over the Song dynasty's imperial seal to Bayan, [...] "an unambiguous symbol of capitulation."

The extract from the letter that the magazine printed was the only writing of Anning's published in the scientific literature during her lifetime. Some personal letters written by her, such as her correspondence with Frances Augusta Bell, were published while she was alive, however.|$|E
