Bile salt mixed micelles are extensively studied as novel drug delivery systems. The objective of the present investigation is to develop and characterize mixed micelles of nonionic (Triton X- 100) or anionic (<b>sodium</b> <b>lauryl</b> ether <b>sulfate)</b> surfactant having oxyethylene groups in the polar head and following bile salts: cholate, deoxycholate and 7 -oxodeoxycholate. Results The micellization behaviour of binary anionic-nonionic and anionic-anionic surfactant mixtures was investigated by conductivity and surface tension measurements. The results of the study have been analyzed using Clint's, Rubingh's, and Motomura's theories for mixed binary systems. The negative values of the interaction parameter indicate synergism between micelle building units. It was noticed that Triton X- 100 and <b>sodium</b> <b>lauryl</b> ether <b>sulfate</b> generate the weakest synergistic interactions with sodium deoxycholate, while 7 -oxodeoxycholate creates the strongest attractive interaction with investigated co-surfactants.

25|$|The {{generally}} accepted methods of making CNT films {{involves the use}} of non-ionic surfactants, such as Triton X-100 and <b>sodium</b> <b>lauryl</b> <b>sulfate,</b> which improves their dispersibility in aqueous solution. These suspensions can then be membrane filtered under positive or negative pressure to yield uniform films. The van der Waals force's interaction between the nanotube surface and the surfactant can often be mechanically strong and quite stable and therefore there are no assurances that all the surfactant is removed from the CNT film after formation. Washing with methanol, an effective solvent in the removal of Triton X, was found to cause cracking and deformation of the film. It has also been found that Triton X can lead to cell lysis and in turn tissue inflammatory responses even at low concentrations.|$|E
