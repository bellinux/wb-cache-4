40|$|Aim The Tasmanian tiger, or thylacine, is an infamous {{example of}} a recent human-mediated extinction. Confined to the island of Tasmania in {{historical}} times, thylacines were hunted to extinction < 150  years after European arrival. Thylacines were also once widespread across the Australian mainland, but became extinct there c.   3, 200  years before present (bp). Very {{little is known about}} thylacine biology and population history; the cause of the thylacines extirpation from the mainland is still debated and the reasons for its survival in Tasmania into the 20 th century are unclear. In this study, we investigate the thylacine's phylogeography and demographic history leading up to their extinction on both the mainland and Tasmania to gain insight into this enigmatic species. Location Southern Australia. Methods We generated 51 new thylacine mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genome sequences from sub-fossil remains and historical museum specimens, and analysed them to reconstruct the species’ phylogeography and demographic history. Results We found evidence that thylacines had contracted into separate eastern and western populations prior to the Last Glacial Maximum (c.   25, 000  yr bp), and that the ancient western population was larger and more genetically diverse than the historical Tasmanian population. At the time of European arrival in c.   1800 CE, Tasmanian thylacines had limited mtDNA diversity, possibly resulting from a bottleneck event broadly coincident with an El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) associated climate event, although we find some indication that the population was expanding during the late Holocene. Main Conclusions The timing of this putative expansion, in concert with a climate event, suggests that climate change had an influence on thylacine population dynamics. Given that ENSO effects are known to have been more severe on mainland Australia, we suggest that climate change, in <b>synergy</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>drivers,</b> is likely to have contributed to the thylacine mainland extinction...|$|E
40|$|There is {{currently}} widespread {{concern about the}} impact of continuing climate change on the distribution, and ultimately persistence of species across all the major taxa. While much previous work has focussed on using climate envelope models to make projections of the location of potential future suitable climate space for a variety of species, these can at best give an indication of the likely direction and potential magnitude of distributional change. They lack information on spatial population dynamics, dispersal, habitat suitability, local adaptation and inter-specific interactions. The aim of this thesis was to explore how some of these other factors might alter projections regarding species’ distributional change in response to climate change, using both theoretical models, and garden warbler (Sylvia borin) as a model system. A key aspect which has been largely over-looked until very recently is the complex range dynamics which can result from spatial variation in population dynamics, and the impacts of inter-annual variability rather than simply mean climate, both of which can impact extinction risk. Much insight into future impacts of climate change can also be gained through studies of past distributional changes, such as that observed in the British breeding population of garden warbler in the last three decades. In many cases, studies at smaller-scales are necessary to elucidate the mechanisms of climate change impacts and further explore potential <b>synergies</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>drivers</b> of ecosystem change such as habitat loss and species invasions. The particular combination of factors which should be included to make projections of distributional change will be species-specific and scale-dependent, therefore modelling exercises should be carefully designed depending on the intended outcome for conservation.

30|$|For park {{management}} {{the results}} from this study point to the need for location context-specific management of fire and elephant concentrations. The changes in woody cover are likely to have effects on the grazer and browser carrying capacities of the savannas in the Kruger National Park. Gillson (2015) recommends the use of fire and grazers as conservation management intervention tools that can help maintain the balance between woody vegetation and grass on savannas. The Kruger National Park has a location context fire management policy that includes the reduction of woody encroachment and maintenance of grazing grass among its ecological management objectives (van Wilgen et al. 2014). As it was in 2013, however, the policy did not seem to have specific fire-related ecological management objectives for the riparian zone-adjacent areas in which the Ngwenyeni and Stevenson-Hamilton sites are located. Improved understanding of the effects of fire and its <b>synergy</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> savanna ecosystem <b>drivers</b> remained a challenge (van Wilgen et al. 2014).|$|R
