In particular, we {{will focus on the}} retrieval of daily evapotranspiration because of the particular significance of this flux in the generation of precipitation or in agricultural water resource management. A detailed methodology to apply the Simplified Two- <b>Source</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Balance</b> method to Landsat imagery is presented. The different surface cropland features are characterized from the CORINE Land Cover maps, and the required meteorological variables are obtained by interpolating the data of a network of agro-meteorological stations distributed within the region of interest. Finally, we show the application of the methodology to three different Landsat images covering the whole Basilicata region (Southern Italy). Maps of the different fluxes including the daily evapotranspiration are performed.

40|$|The {{monitoring}} of the energy fluxes over vineyard applying the one <b>source</b> <b>energy</b> <b>balance</b> model METRIC (Allen et al., 2007 b) are shown in this work. This model is considered operaive because it uses an internalized calibration method derived from the selection of two extreme pixels in the scene, from the minimum ET values such as the bare soil to a maximum that corresponds to full cover active vegetation. The model provides the maps of net radiation (Rn), soil heat flux (G), sensible heat (H), latent heat (LE), evapotranspiration (ET) and crop coefficient (Kc). The flux values have been validated with a flux tower installed in the plot, providing a RMSE for instantaneous fluxes of 43 W m 2, 33 W m 2, 55 W m 2  y 40 W m 2   on Rn, G, H and LE. In relative terms are 8 %, 29 %, 21 % and 20 % respectively. The RMSE at daily scale for the ET is 0. 58 mm day - 1, with a value in the crop coefficient for the mid stage of 0. 42 ± 0. 08.

The manuscript aims to verify the accuracy of the actual evapotranspiration retrieval coupling a single <b>source</b> <b>energy</b> <b>balance</b> approach and two different temporal upscaling schemes. The first scheme tests the temporal upscaling of the main input variables, namely the NDVI, albedo and LST; the second scheme tests the temporal upscaling of the energy balance output, the actual evapotranspiration.

With increasing vineyard acreage, reduced water availability in much of California, and competing water use interests, {{it is critical to}} be able to monitor regional water use and evapotranspiration (ET) over large areas, but also in detail at individual field scales to improve water management within these viticulture production systems. This can be achieved by integrating remote sensing data from multiple satellite systems with different spatiotemporal characteristics. In this research, we evaluate the utility of a multi-scale system for monitoring ET as applied over two vineyard sites near Lodi, California during the 2013 growing season, leading into the drought in early 2014.

Chicken fed mice had elevated hepatic triglyceride relative to casein and cod/scallop fed mice and elevated 4 h fasted plasma cholesterol concentrations compared to low-fat and casein fed mice. In casein fed mice the reduced adiposity was likely related to the observed three percent lower apparent fat digestibility compared to low-fat, chicken and cod/scallop fed mice. After six weeks of feeding an oral glucose tolerance test revealed that despite their lean phenotype, casein fed mice had reduced glucose tolerance compared to low-fat, chicken and cod/scallop fed mice. In a separate set of mice, effects on metabolism were evaluated by indirect calorimetry before onset of diet-induced obesity. Spontaneous locomotor activity decreased in casein and chicken fed mice when shifting from low-fat to high-fat diets, but cod/scallop feeding tended (P =  0. 06) to attenuate this decrease. Moreover, at this shift, energy expenditure decreased in all groups, but was decreased {{to a greater extent}} in casein fed than in cod/scallop fed mice, indicating that protein <b>sources</b> regulated <b>energy</b> expenditure differently.

This <b>energy</b> <b>balance</b> is performed by simultaneously measuring the plastic input energy using a load cell and a strain gauge, and the dissipative energy using the temperature field provided by an infrared camera. Some experimental limitations led to restrain the present procedure to positive stress ratios, and to complement this <b>energy</b> <b>balance</b> by a second measurement while the material plastic work per cycle is negligible compared to the dissipative energy.

This extracting canopy latent heat is an initial approximation to compute iteratively partitioned energy components to soil and vegetation using in Two <b>Source</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Balance</b> (TSEB) Model. This approximation is using a Priestley-Taylor coefficient (and# 945;p) and fractional of Leaf Area Index (fg) that is green. The standard values are 1. 26 and 1 for respectively (and# 945;p) and (fg). This study is focused to identify these two transpiration parameters (and# 945;p) and (fg) by Genetic Algorithm method to accurately predict patterns of turbulent energy fluxes by TSEB Model (Norman et al. 1995), over irrigated olive orchard in semi-arid area (Marrakech, Morocco).

40|$|Due to {{the limited}} {{availability}} of land surface temperature (LST) images, thermal-based evapotranspiration (ET) models can only provide instantaneous ET snapshots. In contrast, models {{that are based on}} near surface soil moisture (SM) and leaf area index (LAI) can operate at daily scales. However, their transpiration schemes need to be more physically realistic and their model parameters usually need to be calibrated by flux measurements. In this study, we incorporated a biophysical canopy conductance (Gc) model into a two <b>source</b> <b>energy</b> <b>balance</b> (TSEB) scheme to replace the original Priestly-Taylor (PT) approximation and then optimized both models (Gc-TSEB and PT-TSEB) at pixel scales using qualified MODIS LST data. The results show that using [ST is almost as effective in the calibration as using flux measurements. This is promising because unlike flux measurements, [ST can be acquired at various spatial resolutions by remote sensing, which makes model calibration feasible for any land pixel. In addition, ET and its partitioning between the canopy and soil layers were found to be reasonable at both validation sites. The day to day and diurnal variations of the predicted ET generally matched the trends and peaks of the flux measurements, although systematic biases were also found due to the decoupling effect of soil moisture at different depths. Furthermore, both models are robust with +/- 50 % changes of SM or LAI because the parameters were automatically adjusted by the LST-calibration. The models are sensitive to LST. However, if the added noise of the LST is less significant than N(+/- 1, 2. 5 (2)), the medians of the RMSEs in the LE predictions from the LST-calibrated models were quite similar to those from the flux-calibrated models. Both models were found to be accurate, but Gc-TSEB provides slightly more precise and robust predictions than PT-TSEB. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

Throughout the Mediterranean region, particularly in Southern Spain, the main river basins suffer an imbalance between the supply and demand for water, {{largely due to the}} variable climatic conditions and human activities. Dealing with the water scarcity situation must rely on the ability to improve management with timely and accurate information about the water status of the ecosystems, that would improved predictions of resource availability and reduced the uncertainty in decision-making processes. The integration of remote sensing data in energy balance modelling can provide this information at different spatio-temporal scales. In water-controlled ecosystems there are many interrelationships between climate, soil and vegetation, with evapotranspiration (ET) as a key variable connecting energy and water budgets. ET has been exhaustively studied in cropped systems and different models for estimating ET at medium-large spatial scales have been developed, based on both soil water balance and surface energy balance. Energy balance (EB) models based on thermal remote sensing data enable updated diagnoses of the actual surface water condition. In general, these models do not require precipitation or soil properties inputs and are mostly conditioned by surface radiometric temperature (TRAD) observations. The methodology that best accounts for the effects of a non-homogeneous partial canopy cover is the twosource approach (Shuttelworth and Wallace, 1985; Norman et al., 1995; Kustas and Norman, 1999), in particular the TSEB, in which surface fluxes are divided into soil and canopy components.

40|$|The {{maintenance}} of energy homeostasis {{is essential for}} life, and its dysregulation leads {{to a variety of}} metabolic disorders. Under a fed condition, mammals use glucose as the main metabolic fuel, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by the colonic bacterial fermentation of dietary fiber also contribute a significant proportion of daily energy requirement. Under ketogenic conditions such as starvation and diabetes, ketone bodies produced in the liver from fatty acids are used as the main <b>energy</b> <b>sources.</b> To <b>balance</b> <b>energy</b> intake, dietary excess and starvation trigger an increase or a decrease in energy expenditure, respectively, by regulating the activity of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). The regulation of metabolic homeostasis by glucose is well recognized; however, the roles of SCFAs and ketone bodies in maintaining <b>energy</b> <b>balance</b> remain unclear. Here, we show that SCFAs and ketone bodies directly regulate SNS activity via GPR 41, a Gi/o protein-coupled receptor for SCFAs, {{at the level of the}} sympathetic ganglion. GPR 41 was most abundantly expressed in sympathetic ganglia in mouse and humans. SCFA propionate promoted sympathetic outflow via GPR 41. On the other hand, a ketone body, β-hydroxybutyrate, produced during starvation or diabetes, suppressed SNS activity by antagonizing GPR 41. Pharmacological and siRNA experiments indicated that GPR 41 -mediated activation of sympathetic neurons involves Gβγ-PLCβ-MAPK signaling. Sympathetic regulation by SCFAs and ketone bodies correlated well with their respective effects on energy consumption. These findings establish that SCFAs and ketone bodies directly regulate GPR 41 -mediated SNS activity and thereby control body energy expenditure in maintaining metabolic homeostasis...|$|R

40|$|An {{efficient}} use of water for irrigation is a challenging task. From an agronomical point of view, it requires establishing the optimal amount of water to be supplied, at the correct time, based on phenological phase and water stress spatial distribution. Indeed, {{the knowledge of the}} actual water stress is essential for agronomic decisions, vineyards need to be managed to maintain a moderate water stress, thus allowing to optimize berries quality and quantity. Methods for quickly quantifying where, when and in what extent, vines begin to experience water stress are beneficial. Traditional point based methodologies, such those based on Scholander pressure chamber, even if well established are time expensive and do not give a comprehensive picture of the vineyard water deficit. Earth Observation (E. O.) based methodologies promise to achieve a synoptic overview of the water stress. Some E. O. data, indeed, sense the territory in the thermal part of the spectrum and, as it is well recognized, leaf radiometric temperature is related to the plant water status. However, current satellite sensors have not detailed enough spatial resolution to detect pure canopy pixels; thus, the pixel radiometric temperature characterizes the whole soil-vegetation system, and in variable proportions. On the other hand, due to limits in the actual crop dusters, {{there is no need to}} characterize the water stress distribution at plant scale, and a coarser spatial characterization would be sufficient. The research aims to assess to what extent: 1) E. O. based canopy radiometric temperature can be used, straightforwardly, to detected plant water status; 2) E. O. based canopy transpiration, would be more suitable (or not) to describe the spatial variability in plant water stress.

During {{the growing season}} the precipitation is generally scarce and infrequent. Irrigation is made possible through the capturing of snow melt in the reservoirs and/or diversions of runoff in the rivers. The spring runoff predictions are used by the irrigators to anticipate the seasonal water availability, and manage the farm and cropping pattern accordingly. Irrigation management and the decisions taken by irrigators differ depending on the quantity of water available. Irrigation scheduling and crop rotations are {{a few examples of}} irrigation management subject to change depending on the availability of water. These management decisions impact the ET and the runoff from the system and ultimately the regional hydrology. These components of the water balance can be evaluated using remote sensing, irrigation diversions, and water flow data. This study examines the irrigation management and performance of the Bear River Canal Company, which is an agricultural irrigation district located in Northern Utah. This region is characterized by a cycle of wet and dry years, which makes it possible to compare the performance at different levels of water availability.

By using a time differential temperature measurement as input, the approach reduces model {{sensitivity to errors}} in absolute temperature retrieval. The original formulation of the DTD required an early morning LST observation (approximately 1 h after sunrise) when surface fluxes are minimal, limiting application to data provided by geostationary satellites at sub-hourly temporal resolution. The DTD model has been applied primarily during the active growth phase of agricultural crops and rangeland vegetation grasses, {{and has not been}} rigorously evaluated during senescence or in forested ecosystems. In this paper we present modifications to the DTD model that enable applications using thermal observation from polar orbiting satellites, such as Terra and Aqua, with day and night overpass times over the area of interest. This allows the application of the DTD model in high latitude regions where large viewing angles preclude the use of geostationary satellites, and also exploits the higher spatial resolution provided by polar orbiting satellites. A method for estimating nocturnal surface fluxes and a scheme for estimating the fraction of green vegetation are developed and evaluated. Modification for green vegetation fraction leads to significantly improved estimation of the heat fluxes from the vegetation canopy during senescence and in forests. Land-cover based modifications to the Priestley&ndash;Taylor scheme, used to estimate transpiration fluxes, are explored based on prior findings for conifer forests. When the modified DTD model is run with LST measurements acquired with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board the Terra and Aqua satellites, generally satisfactory agreement with field measurements is obtained for a number of ecosystems in Denmark and the United States.

40|$|Accurate {{estimation}} of spatial distributions of water (evapotranspiration) and energy fluxes {{is a goal}} sought by hydrologists, agronomists, and meteorologists but is difficult to achieve. The usual approaches to estimating these fluxes employ remote sensing observations and a surface energy flux model. However, resolution of remote sensing data, needed to observe patterns of biophysical variables, is commonly too coarse to distinguish between land cover types that constrain these fluxes. Accuracy of evapotranspiration estimates can be improved by using higher resolution (< 10 m) remote sensing data since they can distinguish clusters of vegetation from bare soil fields and water bodies. A demonstration of this potential is shown using aircraft-based remote sensing observations from multiple platforms over a study site at Goermin, Germany. Four airborne surveys, conducted on the 6 th and 10 th of June and the 4 th and 5 th of July 2006, {{as part of the}} AGRISAR 2006 Experiment (AgriSAR 2006), collected high resolution hyperspectral optical imagery in the visible, near infrared, and thermal infrared. Thermal infrared imagery from the Airborne Hyperspectral Scanner (AHS) of the Spanish Instituto Nacional de Tecnica Aerospacial (INTA) was employed to extract Land Surface Temperature (LST) maps, whereas imagery from the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI- 1500) of the Canadian ITRES was used to derive horizontal (Fractional cover, Fc) and vertical (Leaf Area Index, LAI) vegetation density maps. A Bowen Ratio Energy Balance (BREB) station and a Large Aperture Scintillometer (LAS) station were installed in a winter wheat field and a single LAS was installed in a corn field during the campaign to analyze the energy balance at the surface in detail. To demonstrate the approach, data from a flight line on July the 5 th was employed. Derived LST, Fc and LAI maps were combined with surface micrometeorological observations from a standard weather station in Goermin and with a dual <b>source</b> <b>energy</b> <b>balance</b> model to derive spatially distributed water (evapotranspiration) and energy fluxes. Results show that flux estimates with respect to the ground-based BREB and LAS observations are within observation accuracy, typically within 50 Wm- 2. This means that the high spatial resolution observations can potentially produce evapotranspiration estimates similar in quality to ground-based point measurements. Furthermore, spatial patterns of evapotranspiration fluxes were confirmed by ground-based soil moisture observations. First results on how these estimates relate to spatially distributed hydrologic model output using the PROMET and TOPLATS hydrologic models are presented as well...|$|E
40|$|Evaporation is an {{important}} component of the water cycle, especially in semi-arid lands. Its quantification is crucial for a sustainable management of scarce water resources. Up-to-now, evaporation at large scales is estimated through integrated water balance models forced by distributed meteorological forcing. This forcing includes irrigation inputs from surface and groundwater uptakes. Those amounts are largely unknown at most scales, including the regional scale, i. e. the working scale of institutional stakeholders. An alternative way to quantify evapotranspiration is to exploit the available surface temperature data from remote sensing as a signature of the surface energy balance, including the latent heat flux. Remotely sensed energy balance models enable to estimate stress levels and, in turn, the water status of most continental surfaces. Single-pixel energy balance models such as SEBS (Su, 2002) or TSEB (Norman et al., 1995) are particularly well suited to derive evapotranspiration at high and low resolution over a wide range of land use and landscape types. Two source models, such as TSEB, are interesting since they allow deriving a rough estimate of the water stress of the vegetation instead of that of a mixed surface. Such frameworks can be used with either component surface temperatures (soil and vegetation components retrieved from directional surface temperature data) or a single mixed surface skin temperature. For the latter, a realistic underlying assumption enables to invert two unknowns (evaporation and transpiration) from a single piece of information. This assumption states that, in most cases, vegetation is unstressed, and that if vegetation is stressed, evaporation is negligible. In the latter case, if vegetation stress is not properly into account, the resulting evaporation will decrease to unrealistic levels (negative fluxes) in order to maintain the same total surface temperature. This work challenges the limits of such hypothesis by 1 - studying evaporation and transpiration retrievals using two versions (parallel and series resistance networks) of a two <b>source</b> <b>energy</b> <b>balance</b> model similar to TSEB, and 2 - testing the water stress retrievals (vegetation water stress and moisture-limited soil evaporation) over contrasted test sites in Tunisia (irrigated wheat, rainfed wheat, rainfed olive tree) and Mexico (irrigated wheat). Results show that stress retrievals are most of the time consistent, in their occurrence at least rather than in their exact intensity. However, over a limited number of situations, none of the algorithms converge to a realistic level. Series and parallel resistance networks have similar performances for total evapotranspiration retrievals but lead to different evaporation/transpiration partitions. Bounding relationships and temporal consistency tests are proposed to ensure that convergence is reached at all times to provide robust estimates of evaporation and transpiration...|$|E
40|$|The two <b>source</b> <b>energy</b> <b>balance</b> model (TSEB) can {{estimate}} evaporation (E), transpiration (T), and evapotranspiration (ET) of vegetated surfaces, {{which has}} important applications in {{water resources management}} for irrigated crops. The TSEB requires soil (TS) and canopy (TC) surface temperatures to solve the energy budgets of these layers separately. Operationally, usually only composite surface temperature (TR) measurements are available at a single view angle. For surfaces with nonrandom spatial distribution of vegetation such as row crops, TR often includes both soil and vegetation, which may have vastly different temperatures. Therefore, TS and TC must be derived from a single TR measurement using simple linear mixing, where an initial estimate of TC is calculated, and the temperature – resistance network is solved iteratively until energy balance closure is reached. Two versions of the TSEB were evaluated, where a single TR measurement was used (TSEB-TR) and separate measurements of TS and TC were used (TSEB-TC-TS). All surface temperatures (TS, TC, and TR) were measured by stationary infrared thermometers that viewed an irrigated cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) crop. The TSEB-TR version used a Penman–Monteith approximation for TC, rather than the Priestley-Taylor-based formulation used in the original TSEB version, because this {{has been found to}} result in more accurate partitioning of E and T under conditions of strong advection. Calculations of E, T, and ET by both model versions were compared with measurements using microlysimeters, sap flow gauges, and large monolythic weighing lysimeters, respectively. The TSEB-TR version resulted in similar overall agreement with the TSEB-TC-TS version for calculated and measured E (RMSE = 0. 7 mm d‒ 1) and better overall agreement for T (RMSE = 0. 9 vs. 1. 9 mm d‒ 1), and ET (RMSE = 0. 6 vs. 1. 1 mm d‒ 1). The TSEB-TC-TS version calculated daily ET up to 1. 6 mm d‒ 1 (15 %) less early in the season and up to 2. 0 mm d‒ 1 (44 %) greater later in the season compared with lysimeter measurements. The TSEB-TR also calculated larger ET later in the season but only up to 1. 4 mm d‒ 1 (20 %). ET underestimates by the TSEB-TC-TS version may have been related to limitations in measuring TC early in the season when the canopy was sparse. ET overestimates later in the season by both versions may have been related to a greater proportion of non-transpiring canopy elements (flowers, bolls, and senesced leaves) being out of the TC and TR measurement view...|$|E

Diets with 0, 0. 05 % or 0. 1 % alpha-lipoic acid (alpha-LA), a known AMPK inhibitor were provided to broiler chicks for 7 days. As a result, alpha-LA supplementation decreased the relative growth rate of broiler chicks. Hepatic AMPKalpha 2 mRNA levels were significantly upregulated by dietary alpha-LA, {{in concert with the}} increased phosphorylated AMPKalpha protein levels. In addition, hepatic FAS mRNA levels together with the malonyl-CoA to total CoA ester ratio were reduced by alpha-LA supplementation. Moreover, the hepatic phosphorylated glycogen synthase levels were increased resulting in a markedly decreased hepatic glycogen content. In conclusion, dietary alpha-LA supplementation decreased the in vivo hepatic glycogenesis and lipogenesis via stimulating hepatic AMPKalpha mRNA levels and the phosphorylated gene product. The stimulatory effect of alpha-LA on hepatic AMPK mRNA and pAMPKalpha protein levels together with our previous observations regarding its inhibitory effect on hypothalamic AMPK may have altered the <b>energy</b> <b>balance</b> and hence impaired body weight gain of broiler chicks.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the performance and the domain of validity of the two <b>source</b> <b>energy</b> <b>balance</b> model (TSEB) for the monitoring of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) as a first step towards its use for irrigation planning. Secondary objectives were to analyze the ability of TSEB model to detect water stress and to evaluate evapotranspiration partition between evaporation (E) and transpiration (T) over irrigated annual crops. Within this context, TSEB was compared to the calibrated FAO- 56 dual approach, taken as a reference tool for the monitoring of crop water consumption. TSEB computes ET,, as the residual of a double component energy balance driven by the radiative surface temperature (T-s) used as a proxy of crop hydric conditions; the FAO- 56 dual crop coefficient approach uses the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a proxy of Basal Crop Coefficient (K-cb) and assesses the hydric status directly by solving a two layer soil water budget. Both approaches were evaluated over four plots of wheat and sugar beet located in the Haouz plain (Marrakech, Morocco) that were instrumented with eddy covariance systems during the 2012 and 2013 growing seasons. Series of ASTER images were acquired during the first agricultural season. Both models offered fair performances compared to ET observations with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) lower than 1 mm day- 1 apart from the FAO- 56 dual approach on the sugar beet plot because of uncertain irrigation inputs. This highlights a major weakness of this model when water inputs are uncertain; a very likely case at the plot scale. By contrast, the TSEB model offered smoother performances in all cases. The potentialities of both approaches to predict a water stress index based on the departure from potential evapotranspiration (ETa) was evaluated: although the FAO- 56 dual was better suited to detect high water stresses, the TSEB model was able to detect moderate stresses without a need to prescribe water inputs. Finally, the partition of ETa between soil evaporation and plant transpiration was estimated indirectly by confrontation between simulated soil evaporation and surface (0 - 5 cm) soil moisture acquired spatially with Theta Probe sensors and taken as a proxy of soil evaporation. TSEB evaporation was well correlated to surface soil moisture (r = 0. 82) for low Leaf Area Index (LAI) values (< 1. 5 m(2) m(- 2)). In addition, TSEB predicted partition compared well to snapshot measurements based on the stable isotope method, This in-depth comparison of two simple tools to monitor ET, leads us to the conclusion that the TSEB model can reasonably be used to map ETa on large scale and possibly for the decision-making process of irrigation scheduling...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} three {{recent studies}} by the same authors with the objective to study the effect of dietary <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> on the <b>energy</b> <b>balance</b> (EB) and risk for metabolic and reproductive disorders in dairy cows in early lactation. The first study, a literature survey, illustrated that feeding extra glucogenic nutrients relative to lipogenic nutrients, decreased milk fat and seems to decrease plasma non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) and ß-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) concentration. However studies are scarce and mostly confound the effect of <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> with level of energy intake, compromising eventual effects on EB and fertility. Therefore, in the second study, 16 dairy cows were either fed a glucogenic or a lipogenic diet (isocaloric) and EB was determined in climate-controlled respiration chambers from week 2 until 9 of lactation. Glucogenic diet decreased milk fat yield and milk energy and tended to decrease body fat mobilization compared with lipogenic diet. The objective of the third study was to study the effect of dietary <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> on EB, metabolites and reproduction variables. Dairy cows (n = 111) were fed glucogenic, lipogenic or mixed diet from week 3 until week 9 relative to calving. Multiparous cows fed glucogenic diet had lower milk fat yield, higher calculated EB, and lower plasma NEFA, BHBA and liver triacylglyceride concentration and tended to have fewer days to first postpartum ovulation. In conclusion, increasing the glucogenic nutrient availability improved the EB and had potential {{to reduce the risk}} for metabolic disorders and to improve reproductive performance in dairy cows...|$|R
