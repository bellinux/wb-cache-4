It's got a shot that's always <b>stuck</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> when Buzz Lightyear discovers he's a toy. He's sitting on this landing {{at the top of}} the staircase and the camera pulls back and he's this tiny little figure. He was this guy with a massive ego two seconds before... and it's stunning. I'd put that as one of my top ten films, period." ...|$|E
500|$|The album artwork {{was done}} by Raymond Pettibon, {{who has worked with}} punk bands such as Black Flag and Minutemen. Grohl was {{introduced}} to Pettibon by ex-Minutemen bassist Mike Watt and, after visiting his house, decided to hire him for the artwork because [...] "we had to somehow pay tribute to Pettibon as a hero, because his stuff, those images just <b>stuck</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> my whole life." [...] Grohl came up with the heart theme used in the booklet and related singles. The album was issued with two different covers, black and white. The first 575,000 units comprised a limited edition with a bonus DVD.|$|E
500|$|Vincent D'Onofrio's {{character}} in [...] "Subway" [...] partially inspired {{the creation of}} the antagonist played by Bryan Cranston in [...] "Drive", a sixth season episode of The X-Files, which first aired on November 15, 1998. In the episode, Cranston's character is unpleasant and anti-semitic, but he is dying throughout the episode, and screenwriter Vince Gilligan intended for the audience to sympathize with him despite his unlikeable qualities. Gilligan said that this was influenced by [...] "Subway", which he called an [...] "amazing episode". He said of D'Onofio's character: [...] "The brilliant thing they did in this episode, the thing that <b>stuck</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> was this guy's an asshole, the guy really is unpleasant, and yet at the end (you) still feel his humanity." [...] The casting of Cranston in this role directly led Gilligan to eventually cast him as the lead in his television series Breaking Bad.|$|E

But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost, hath never forgiveness, but {{is in danger of}} eternal damnation. Mark iii. 29. And I did the rather give credit to this, because of that {{sentence}} in the Hebrews: For you know how that afterwards, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected; for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.

500|$|Joel Torre, who portrays Mario [...] "Tatang" [...] Maghari in the film, {{had already}} been cast before Matti's script revision; Angel Aquino plays his wife Lulette and Empress Schuck portrays his {{daughter}} Tina. Of the role, Torre said, [...] " [...] <b>stuck</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> fought for me. And that gave {{me a lot of}} confidence, a Bushido Blade samurai." [...] Matti asked Piolo Pascual {{to play the role of}} Attorney Francis Coronel Jr; Shaina Magdayao plays his wife Nicky and Michael de Mesa portrays his father-in-law Congressman Manrique. The role of Daniel was originally written for John Lloyd Cruz, who was interested but had to decline due to scheduling conflicts; it went instead to Gerald Anderson. After a discussion between Pascual and Anderson about the film, Anderson signed on for the role. Anderson had only two weeks to film his scenes as he was occupied with a soap opera shoot at the time. Dawn Jimenez appeared in her acting debut as Anderson's girlfriend Diane.|$|E
500|$|Metallica's Lars Ulrich, who, {{along with}} bandmate James Hetfield {{inducted}} Black Sabbath into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006, said [...] "Black Sabbath is {{and always will}} be synonymous with heavy metal", while Hetfield said [...] "Sabbath got me started on all that evil-sounding shit, and it's <b>stuck</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> Tony Iommi is the king of the heavy riff." [...] former Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash said of the Paranoid album: [...] "There's just something about that whole record that, when you're a kid and you're turned onto it, it's like a whole different world. It just opens up your mind to another dimension...Paranoid is the whole Sabbath experience; very indicative of what Sabbath meant at the time. Tony's playing style—doesn't matter whether it's off Paranoid or if it's off Heaven and Hell—it's very distinctive." [...] Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian said [...] "I always get the question in every interview I do, 'What are your top five metal albums?' I make it easy for myself and always say the first five Sabbath albums." ...|$|E
500|$|Once Upon the Time co-creator Adam Horowitz {{said that}} his {{earliest}} Disney memory was seeing a re-release of Disney's Snow White when he was [...] "terrified by the Evil Queen while also being unable to look away and that <b>stuck</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> through the years." [...] Similarly, fashion designer and Angelina Jolie's Maleficent collaborator Stella McCartney said: [...] "My favorite Disney film was Snow White. I remember growing up watching [...] and being completely freaked out by that scene where the evil queen becomes the old witch and she makes the poison apple." [...] Film maker and actor Terry Gilliam listed the film's Queen among his eight favourite villains, commenting how [...] "truly strange" [...] is that [...] "vanity and beauty are what she's all about, yet the identity she assumes when she becomes the old beggar woman is practically the ugliest in all the kingdom." [...] Fairy tale lecturer Jack Zipes alike noted that [...] "it is somewhat strange that the queen believes the mirror, for the picture of Snow White reveals {{that she is a}} pretty pubescent red-cheeked ordinary girl while the queen is a stunning beautiful mature woman who might easily win a beauty contest." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brown {{called his}} team {{together}} {{the night before}} the Test began. His first words were [...] "Chaps, you have got to get <b>stuck</b> into this <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> I have not lost faith. We can win if we go out there to-morrow and get stuck right into it." [...] He told them that he knew they had not produced their English form. He told them that their batting, bowling, fielding and catching were too often just too bad to be true. Chosen, as they were, to represent their country, they obviously could do better. Brown's told them just what he thought of everything. He finished by saying that if they went on to the field on the morrow with confidence in themselves, they could do the job.|$|R
500|$|Keith Thornton, {{best known}} by the stage name Kool Keith, {{released}} the album Dr. Octagonecologyst in 1996, under the name Dr. Octagon, produced by Dan [...] "The Automator" [...] Nakamura. Thornton later expressed some frustration with the [...] "Dr. Octagon" [...] nickname, saying, [...] "Octagon wasn't my life...I've {{done a lot of}} things that were totally around different things other than Octagon. Are some people just afraid to venture off into my life and see that I do other things which are great? I think people <b>stuck</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> something." [...] In 1999, Thornton released the album First Come, First Served, which featured a track in which the newly introduced character Dr. Dooom murdered Dr. Octagon. Thornton had intended to move away from the Dr. Octagon character, but later decided to record another album under the Octagon name.|$|R
500|$|Allmusic {{reviewer}} Steve Huey {{wrote that}} Dr. Octagonecologyst [...] "...attracted {{more attention than}} any non-mainstream rap album in quite a while, thanks to its inventive production and Keith's bizarre, free-associative rhymes." [...] Huey also states that Dr. Octagonecologyst represented [...] "...the first truly new, genuine alternative to commercial hip-hop since the Native Tongues' heyday. It appealed strongly to alternative audiences who'd grown up with rap music, but simply hadn't related to it since the rise of gangsta". Thornton expressed some frustration with the Dr. Octagon nickname, saying, [...] "I just made a record. I was an artist on a project, and I think people [...] that I was an artist on a project.

500|$|The act was {{something}} that affected Kiedis significantly because he had never before experienced such an enlightening ideology on life. Growing up in Los Angeles, he had always thought differently from Hagen. Instead of giving material possessions away and being free thinking, the vocalist believed one must take what one wants, as {{no one else will}} provide. Instead, he now adopted Hagen's philosophy: [...] "It was such an epiphany that someone would want to give me her favorite thing. That <b>stuck</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> forever. Every time I'd be thinking 'I have to keep,' I'd remember 'No, you gotta give away instead.' When I started going regularly to [...] meetings, one of the principles I had learned was that the way to maintain your own sobriety is to give it to another suffering alcoholic. Every time you empty your vessel of that energy, fresh new energy comes flooding in." [...] Flea's bassline for the song allowed Kiedis to recall this incident and he believed the music paired perfectly with the lyrics. During the verses, Kiedis departs from the idea of unselfishness and sings about a variety of topics including long-time friend River Phoenix, musician Bob Marley and various sexual themes including fertility and lust.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the album's title, Welch told MTV News, [...] "It {{was an art}} {{installation}} done in the '70s, {{this video}} piece all done on Super 8, this big procession of kind of coquette-style hippies and all these different colored robes and masks, {{and it was all}} to do with color, really saturated, brightly colored pastas and balloons. I saw it a couple years ago, and it was called 'Ceremonials' and then, like, Roman numerals after it. And the word sort of <b>stuck</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> and I think the whole idea of performance, and kind of putting on this outfit and going out almost to find some sort of exorcism or absolution, to kind of get outside yourself, there's a sense of ceremony to it." [...] Welch also revealed that she wanted to call the album Violence, stating, [...] "I wanted to make an album that sounded like the soundtrack to Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet, the violence mixed with the classical Shakespearean drama mixed with the pop and the pulp, extreme neon stuff." [...] In an interview with The Guardian, she described the album as [...] "much bigger" [...] and categorised its genre as [...] "chamber soul", a mixture of chamber pop and soul. The liner notes of Ceremonials contain an essay by English writer Emma Forrest, dated 21 September 2011.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} is a transcript provided by [...] from a [...] in which John Mueller of Google speaks about the Title tag {{and its relation to}} SEO:DANIEL PICKEN: I had a quick question. And John, it was about something you said a few weeks ago, actually. You said the title tag is a ranking signal, but you said that you use a part of the title tag. And that's really <b>stuck</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> And I was just wondering what you meant by that, when you say you use a part of the title tag as a ranking signal.JOHN MUELLER: We use that just as a part. I think it's not like the primary ranking factor of a page, to put it that way.DANIEL PICKEN: Right.JOHN MUELLER: We do use it for ranking, but it's not the most critical part of a page. So it's not worthwhile filling it with keywords to kind of hope that it works that way. In general, we try to recognize when a title tag is stuffed with keywords because that's also a bad user experience for users in the search results. If they're looking to understand what these pages are about and they just see a jumble of keywords, then that doesn't really help.Moz has already been cited as assigning critical importance to the Title tags. However, they have the following to say about the Meta description:... it's important to note that meta descriptions do not directly influence Google's ranking algorithms for normal web search.
