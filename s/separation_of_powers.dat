5|$|Article III has one section, {{confirming}} {{the principle of}} <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> between the legislative, executive and judicial branches of government. Unlike the U.S. federal Constitution, the Virginia Constitution explicitly provides that no branch may exercise powers that properly belong to the others. Separation between the branches of government is also listed as a {{right of the people}} in §5 of Article I.|$|E
5|$|Hill {{also argued}} that if the Electoral Act {{actually}} appeared to confer jurisdiction on the court, it was nevertheless invalid, as the determination of disputes about election results is a non-judicial function. Also, the doctrine of <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> meant that non-judicial power cannot be conferred on a Chapter III Court such as the High Court.|$|E

5|$|Two of the judges, Justice Deane and Justice Gaudron, {{went further}} and {{suggested}} {{that the right to}} representation in some circumstances is founded in the Constitution. They said that Chapter Three of the Constitution, which represents the Judicature with the notion of <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers,</b> and vests judicial power exclusively in the courts, requires that judicial process and fairness be observed.|$|E

5|$|Germany is a federal, parliamentary, {{representative}} democratic republic. The German {{political system}} operates under a framework {{laid out in}} the 1949 constitutional document known as the Grundgesetz (Basic Law).

Justice Anthony Kennedy, Justice Clarence Thomas, Justice Stephen Breyer, Justice Samuel Alito, and Justice Elena Kagan joined the majority opinion (however, Justice Thomas did not join as to Part II-C of the opinion).|$|E

5|$|The Tenth Amendment {{reinforces}} {{the principles of}} <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> and federalism by providing that powers not granted {{to the federal government}} by the Constitution, nor prohibited to the states, are reserved to the states or the people. The amendment provides no new powers or rights to the states, but rather preserves their authority in all matters not specifically granted to the federal government.|$|E
5|$|The sole {{content of}} Article III is the {{statement}} regarding <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers.</b> The three branches (executive, judicial, and legislative) are created and defined.

5|$|Turkey {{has adopted}} the {{principle}} of the <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers.</b> In line with this principle, judicial power is exercised by independent courts on behalf of the Turkish nation. The independence and organisation of the courts, the security of the tenure of judges and public prosecutors, the profession of judges and prosecutors, the supervision of judges and public prosecutors, the military courts and their organisation, and the powers and duties of the high courts are regulated by the Turkish Constitution.|$|E
5|$|A {{legal issue}} must be {{justiciable}} before the High Court will grant an applicant leave {{to apply for}} judicial review. Justiciability recognizes the limited capabilities of the courts. It delineates certain issues which fall beyond the purview of judicial review because those matters are unsuited for adjudication, {{due to the nature}} of the litigation process and judicial expertise. The doctrine is based on an understanding of the <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> and the need to find the right constitutional balance between the courts and the executive. For example, matters of policy or subjective preference, and polycentric public policy issues, are better left in the hands of an elected body of persons.|$|E
5|$|At present, Romania {{is divided}} into 41 {{counties}} and one municipality (Bucharest); these are assigned as the NUTS-3 geocode statistical subdivision scheme of Romania within the European Union. Each of the counties is further divided into cities (some of which have municipality status) and communes. The prefect and his administration have executive prerogatives within the county limits, while limited legislative powers are assigned to a County Council elected every four years during local elections. The territorial districts of the Romanian judicial system overlap with county borders, thus avoiding further complication in the <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> on the government.|$|E

5|$|The House of Lords' {{statement}} on parliamentary privilege {{was assessed by}} the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege, which recommended that Parliament not counter the decision in Pepper v Hart, but cautioned that this should not lead to any further weakening of parliamentary privilege. However, academics widely condemned the decision and the thinking behind it. Academic Aileen Kavanagh questioned the logic used; the House of Lords was essentially saying that, where a minister has made a statement about an act's intent that was not questioned by Parliament, that statement {{can be used as}} evidence. However, there are many reasons why Members of Parliament might not question a statement, and this does not necessarily indicate that they approve of it; {{in the case of the}} Finance Act, for example, it could simply be that as the statement was not going to be added to the statute, they found no reason to actively oppose it. At the same time, different Members of Parliament may approve of a statutory provision for different reasons. The fact that a minister gives certain reasons for including a provision does not necessarily indicate that Parliament agrees; only that Parliament also feels, for whatever reason, that the provision should be included. The decision also raises questions about the <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> in the United Kingdom; it has been consistently maintained that it is Parliament, not the executive, which passes legislation. If one accepts that statements by the executive can allow them to specify the meaning of particular laws without formally including them in statutes where they can be approved by Parliament, it violates this <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers,</b> allowing the executive to make law.|$|E

Progressives sought to reform corrupt political practices of the ruling Martin machine and to regulate railroads and big corporations. Martin delegates agreed to restrict suffrage of African-Americans and illiterate whites, and a State Corporation Commission was established. When the railroads challenged the State Corporation Commission's constitutionality on the grounds it violated <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers,</b> the commission was upheld in the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals.|$|E
5|$|The four judges {{then went}} on to decide that the {{jurisdiction}} involved an exercise of judicial power, mentioning an earlier decision of Justice Isaacs, in which he had taken a functional approach, and determined that some functions, when conferred upon a legislative or executive body, can involve the exercise of non-judicial power, but the same functions when conferred on a judicial body involve the exercise of judicial power. The four judges found that the powers conferred on the court, to take evidence and compel witnesses and such, when vested in a judicial body such as the court, involved the exercise of judicial power. As such, the jurisdiction did not offend the <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers.</b>|$|E
