40|$|The Savannah River Site is {{currently}} developing and testing several processes to treat high level radioactive liquid waste. Each {{of these processes}} has a solid-liquid separation process that limits its throughput. Savannah River National Laboratory researchers identified and tested the rotary microfilter as a technology to increase solid-liquid separation throughput. The authors believe the rotary microfilter throughput can be improved by using a better filter membrane. Previous testing showed that asymmetric filters composed of a ceramic membrane {{on top of a}} stainless steel support produced higher filter flux than 100 % stainless steel symmetric filters in crossflow filter tests. Savannah River National Laboratory and Oak Ridge National Laboratory are working together to develop asymmetric ceramic ? stainless steel composite filters and asymmetric 100 % stainless steel filters to improve the throughput of the rotary microfilter. The Oak Ridge National Laboratory Inorganic Membrane Group fabricated samples of alternative filter membranes. In addition, Savannah River National Laboratory obtained samples of filter membranes from Pall, Porvair, and SpinTek. They tested these samples in a <b>static</b> <b>test</b> <b>cell</b> with feed slurries containing monosodium titanate and simulated sludge...|$|E

The production figure in 1995 was 7. 6 million tonnes {{and it is}} anticipated {{that by the year}} 2000, the country's production can easily attain 8. 8 million tonnes. Palm oil and its products which are exported are in refined, bleached and deodorized forms. This means that thee present refining process in Malaysia causes the destruction of most of the minor components (carotenoids, sterol,tocopherol and tocotrienols) in the crude oil. Membrane applications and research in the edible oil industry are well documented in recent years. Separation of minor components from crude palm by membranes is a new technique. At UTM, research has been initiated to study the possibilities of using membranes to separate carotene from crude palm oil. Preliminary laboratory studies have been conducted by using carotene rich palm olein as the raw sample. A <b>static</b> <b>test</b> <b>cell</b> with effective tested diameter of 22 mm and feed volume of 30 ml was used. Two types of new class of solvent stable membranes were determined by using commercial extraction solvents such as hexane and methanol.

40|$|Testing was {{conducted}} at the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) to investigate filter membrane performance {{in an effort to}} increase rotary microfilter (RMF) throughput. Membranes were tested in the SpinTek Filtration, Inc. <b>Static</b> <b>Test</b> <b>Cell</b> (STC), which permitted quick and easy testing of several different membranes. Testing consisted of 100 hours tests with two different slurry feeds, based on recommendations from the phase 1 testing. One feed contained Monosodium Titanate (MST) solids in a simulated salt solution. The other feed contained simulated sludge batch 6 (SB 6) solids in a simulated salt solution. Five membranes were tested, one each from filter manufactures Pall and Porvair and three from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The membrane from Pall is the current membrane used on the latest generation RMF. The Porvair membrane performed well in previous STC tests as well as one of the ORNL membranes. The other two membranes from ORNL were recently developed and not available for the previous STC test. The results indicate that the Porvair filter performed best with the MST slurry and the ORNL SVB 6 - 1 B filter performed best with the SB 6 slurry. Difficulty was encountered with the ORNL filters due to their dimensional thickness, which was greater than the recommended filter thickness for the STC. The STC equipment was modified to complete the testing of the ORNL filters...|$|E

The technology uses supported microporous membranes rotating at high rpm, under pressure, to separate suspended and colloidal solids from liquid streams, yielding a solids-free permeate stream and a highly concentrated solids stream. This is a crosscutting technology that falls under the Efficient Separations and Processing Crosscutting Program, with potential application to tank wastes, contaminated groundwater, landfill leachate, and secondary liquid waste streams from other remediation processes, including decontamination and decommissioning systems. Membrane-screening tests were performed with the SpinTek STC-X 4 <b>static</b> <b>test</b> <b>cell</b> filtration unit, using five ceramic membranes with different pore size and composition. Based on permeate flux, a 0. 25 -{micro}m TiO{sub 2 }/Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } membrane was selected for detailed performance evaluation using the SpinTek ST-IIL centrifugal membrane filtration unit with a surrogate tank waste solution. An extended test run of 100 hr performed on a surrogate tank waste solution showed some deterioration in filtration performance, based on flux, apparently due to the buildup of solids near the inner portion of the membrane where relative membrane velocities were low. Continued testing of the system will focus on modifications to the shear pattern across the entire membrane surface to affect improved long-term performance...|$|E

The technology uses supported microporous membranes rotating at high rpm, under pressure, to separate suspended and colloidal solids from liquid streams, yielding a solids-free permeate stream {{and a highly}} concentrated solids stream. The Tank Waste Focus Area was chosen for study. Membrane-screening tests were performed with the STC-X 4 <b>static</b> <b>test</b> <b>cell</b> filtration unit, using five ceramic membranes with different pore size and composition. Based on permeate flux, a 0. 25 -{mu}m TiO{sub 2 }/Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } membrane was selected for detailed performance evaluation using the centrifugal membrane filtration unit with a surrogate tank waste solution. The performance of the unit was evaluated with a statistical test design that determined the effect of temperature, pressure, membrane rotational speed, and solids loading on permeate flux. All four variables {{were found to be}} statistically significant, with the magnitude of the effect in the order of temperature, solids loading, rotor speed, and pressure. Temperature, rotor speed, and pressure had an increasing effect on flux with increasing value, while increases in solids loading showed a decrease in permeate flux. Significant interactions between rotor speed and solids loading and pressure and solids loading were also observed. The regression equation derived from test data had a correlation coefficient of 0. 934, which represents a useful predictive capability for integrating the technology into DOE cleanup efforts. An extended test run performed on surrogate waste showed some deterioration in filtration performance, based on flux, apparently due to the buildup of solids near the inner portion of the membrane where relative membrane velocities were low. Continued testing of the system will focus on modifications to the shear pattern across the entire membrane surface to affect improved long-term performance...|$|E

"Includes bibliographic {{references}} (leaves 66 - 69) There {{has been}} enormous {{boom in the}} air travel in recent times. There is increasing demand for the technological advancement nowadays towards {{the safety of the}} onboard passengers. Certification of aircrafts requires engineers to demonstrate that a head contact with any aircraft interior complies with the Head injury criteria (HIC) threshold of 1000 units specified in 14 CFR 23. 562, 25. 562, 27. 562. Analyzing injuries {{to the head of the}} occupant when it comes to contact with any aircraft cabin interiors is of serious issue. HIC compliance is a major concern for all the segments of the aircraft industry due to high cost involved in the certification. This research is an attempt to find a cost effective and yet valid approach to solve the HIC problem for the front row bulkhead seats in transport aircrafts. Previous experience, Quasi <b>static</b> <b>testing,</b> Finite element modeling and Madymo biodynamic simulations are utilized for the HIC compliant bulkheads. Madymo (Mathematical Dynamical Model) is a software package which can be used to simulate the dynamic behavior of Mechanical systems. It has a unique combination of fully integrated multibody and finite element techniques. Quasi <b>static</b> <b>testing</b> on various <b>cell</b> size honeycomb core configurations was carried out. Finite element modeling of honeycomb core was done using Msc Patran software package. Comprehensive parametric study has been carried out on different boundary conditions in which the bulkhead may be fixed. Variable thicknesses of the bulkhead which can be used has been looked upon in this study. Different restraint systems and varied seat setback distances have been used for the parametric study. Nylon belt and the Polyester belt are the two different types of belts with different elongation characteristics which are used in this study. The validated madymo models are then used to conduct a parametric study on the effect of the stiffness and strength of the bulkhead on HIC attenuation below the injury levels...|$|R

Validation of the new T- 97 thrust measurement system is required prior to use for official RSRM performance assessments. Since thrust cannot be measured on RSRM flight motors, flight motor measured chamber pressure and a nominal thrust-to-pressure relationship (based on <b>static</b> <b>test</b> motor thrust and pressure measurements) are used to reconstruct flight motor performance.
