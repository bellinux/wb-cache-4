5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1142 Robert {{returned}} to Normandy to assist Geoffrey with operations against some of Stephen's remaining followers there, before returning in the autumn. Matilda came under increased pressure from Stephen's forces and was surrounded at Oxford. Oxford was a secure town, protected by walls and the River Isis, but Stephen led a sudden attack across the river, leading the charge and swimming part of the way. Once on the other side, the King and his men stormed into the town, trapping Matilda in the castle. Oxford Castle was a powerful fortress and, rather than storming it, Stephen decided to settle down for a long siege. Just before Christmas, Matilda sneaked out of the castle {{with a handful of}} knights (probably via a postern gate), crossed the icy river on foot and made her escape past the royal army to <b>safety</b> <b>at</b> Wallingford, leaving the castle garrison free to surrender the next day.|$|E
5|$|In 1314, Château Gaillard was {{the prison}} of Margaret and Blanche of Burgundy, future queens of France; {{they had been}} convicted of {{adultery}} in the Tour de Nesle Affair, and after having their heads shaved they were locked away in the fortress. Following the Scottish defeat at the Battle of Halidon Hill in 1333 during the Second War of Scottish Independence, the child-king David II and certain of his court were forced to flee to France for <b>safety.</b> <b>At</b> the time, southern Scotland was occupied by the forces of King Edward III of England. David, then nine years old, and his bride Joan of the Tower, the twelve-year-old daughter of Edward II, were granted the use of Château Gaillard by Philip VI. It remained their residence until David's return to Scotland in 1341. David did not stay out of English hands for long after his return; he was captured after the Battle of Neville's Cross in 1346 and endured an eleven-year captivity in the Tower of London.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the Brighton Marine Palace Pier Company (owned by the Noble Organisation), {{admitted}} {{an offence}} of breaching public safety under the Health and <b>Safety</b> <b>at</b> Work Act {{and had to}} pay fines and costs of £37,000 after a fairground ride was operated with part of its track missing. A representative from the Health and Safety Executive said that inadequate procedures were {{to blame for the}} fact that nothing had been done to alert staff or passengers that the ride would be dangerous to use. The pier management came into criticism from Brighton and Hove City Council, who thought they were relying too much on fairground rides, some of which were being built too high.|$|E
