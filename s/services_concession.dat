40|$|Many supply {{contracts}} {{between the state}} and private agents in a developing country are cost-re-imbursement variety and are rolled out under weak and unreliable governance. The latter has to be provided for through higher supply cost. The state in turn can lower the contract cost by providing verifiable credible commitments of its intentions. We show using a modified the Laffont-Tirole cost-reimbursement contract model that the more reliable is the state in respect to the delivery of its contractual obligations, the lower the cost of contracts to the state and society. We argue that the various actions taken by the Philippine government before the privatization of the water service in Metro Manila in 1997, viz., the substantial increase in the tariff, the reduction in the labor complement by 30 % and the outsourcing of the dispute resolution mechanism to an international appeals panel, induced entry and aggressive bidding by the contenders that dramatically reduced the cost to the public of the water <b>services</b> <b>concession</b> contract in Metro Manila, Philippines...|$|E
40|$|Romania’s {{adhesion}} to the European Union on 1 January 2007 determined deep {{changes in}} the legislation in matters of concessions, publicprivate partnership and volunteerism. Thus new regulations emerged, such as Government Emergency Ordinance no. 34 / 2006 regarding the award of public procurement contracts, public works concession contracts and <b>services</b> <b>concession</b> contracts or the Emergency Ordinance no. 54 of 28 June 2006 concerning the contracts of procurement of public assets. Similarly the Law no. 554 / 2004 on the administrative dispute includes contracts concluded by the public authorities, contracts having the aim to valorize the public goods, the execution of works for public interest, public services, public procurement; by special laws can be provided other categories of public administration contracts subject to administrative jurisdiction of administrative dispute. Undoubtedly the new regulations prove the importance of administrative contracts – perceived {{as a form of}} ongoing public-private partnership – as being the instrument through which the individual lives and the community’s existence are influenced positively, without affecting the public budget, which by contrast, has been increased by the income achieved. </p...|$|E

40|$|Public <b>service</b> <b>concession</b> is a {{fundamental}} legal institute to understand {{the evolution of the}} relationship between public powers and private autonomies and, at the same time, to analyze the issue of public/private divide in Administrative Law. Starting from a critical examination of the main tendencies of the present judicial decisions and legal science, this work aims to shed light on some uncertainties related to the traditional idea of concession as a “public law” tool: particular attention is paid to execution of concession contracts and judicial review. After having analyzed the legal arguments on which the traditional definition of concessions as “public law” instrument is based (such as the issue of “public object” and the presence of the so called “clauses exorbitantes du droit commun”), the work tries to demonstrate – also underlining the significant changes brought about by EU law in the field of public contracts and on the very definition of public service – the possibility to conceive public <b>service</b> <b>concession</b> as a private instrument, without prejudice to public interest and, consequently, to public service principles...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to present}} the Brazilian model of public <b>service</b> <b>concessions</b> and {{regulatory}} agencies, {{as well as to}} analyze how the new regulatory framework of the port sector fits in this model. Methodology/approach/design – The method of approach is the inductive one and through literature reviewing. It is a qualitative research based on the administrative process theory of regulation. Findings – The results suggest that the new regulatory framework of the port sector follows the rules of the concession model and regulatory agencies, despite having unique characteristics. It was also found that the port legal framework provides conditions for a regulatory oriented production to meet the public interest. Practical implications – This study provides {{a better understanding of the}} relationship, not always clear, between the model of public <b>service</b> <b>concession</b> and rendering port-associated services. There are also relevant practical issues concerning the identification of differences between the port sector and the traditional model of concessions and the possibility of regulatory-oriented production to meet the public interest...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Infrastructure {{development}} {{and the provision of}} basic services is primarily the government’s responsibility. In order to execute these responsibilities, the states increasingly enter into various partnerships, such as cooperative arrangements, with the private sector, whereby they share the risks and responsibilities. The partnerships are particularly pertinent to South Africa, in that the country is faced with service delivery challenges. For example, one of the challenges faced by municipalities primarily responsible for service delivery is rural development, which includes a massive infrastructure backlog, which requires measures addressing funding and delivery capacity requirements. This research on public sector accounting for public-private partnerships (PPP) assesses {{the extent to which the}} current available accounting standards cover the complexities that may arises from PPPs arrangements. The dissertation is a case study on actual PPP arrangements to establish whether the private sector and public sector accounting standard’s guidelines on PPP provide sufficient appropriate guidance on how to account for these complex PPP arrangements. The current available standards that form part of the study are GRAP 32 Standard of GRAP on <b>Service</b> <b>Concession</b> Arrangements: Grantor, Guideline on accounting for public-private partnerships and IFRIC 12 <b>Service</b> <b>Concession</b> Agreements.
