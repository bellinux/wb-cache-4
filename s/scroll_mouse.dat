40|$|Radiologists {{make their}} main {{analysis}} and diagnosis based on careful observation of medical images, {{although there are}} all kinds of automatic methods under development. Radiologists typically use a <b>scroll</b> <b>mouse</b> to click on an image when they find something interesting, and they also use the mouse to navigate through the image slices in volumetric scans. Thus they perform many thousands of mouse clicks every day, causing wrist fatigue. This paper presents a method of improving the mouse pointing performance by reducing the time taken to move the mouse to a target. We use a dynamic Control-to-Display ratio of the mouse, by adjusting the ratio according to the current distance to the target. In theory this reduces the difficulty of the target selection, and also reduces the movement time. The result of a preliminary study demonstrates that the speed of pointing can be improved under certain conditions, particularly for small targets and for long distances to move. In addition, all participants claim that this mouse speed change reduces the difficulty of selecting a small target...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Animations are {{the best}} suited to convey and create an impact of an idea or concept in media business. Animations are {{sequential}} frames of pictures shown across this fourth dimension, namely "time. " Cartoons {{are the best}} examples of animations; needless to say, animations grab the attentions of every one. Animations can also be effectively used in medical education especially in teaching human embryology. It communicates of a concept of three-dimensional structures against one more dimension, namely time. However, to create a module of animation, knowledge, and operative skills of animation software like Flash®, Author ware®, Macromedia® or other high-ended software is necessary. Aim: To design simple, user-friendly and easy to make an effective animation using one of the office tools of Windows®, Power Point®. Materials and Methods: A personal computer with following configuration was used. Pentium III processor with 1. 3 Gz speed, 40 GB HDD, 128 MB RAM, with multimedia kit, key pad, and <b>scroll</b> <b>mouse</b> was used. Programs used were Power Point® and MS Paint®. A screen play of sequences of diagrams was written. Frames consisting of diagrams of stages of development were drawn in MS Paint®, and were pasted in PowerPoint slides and animation tool was applied. Previewing was done at every stage. Results: Stages of development of storyboard have been shown as print screen images, 1 - 6. Conclusion: Emphasis is that such simple animations can be easily made. It is cheap and does not require any sophisticated software. However, it is time consuming but can be taken up as phased assignments or can be given as undergraduate student projects. This will certainly help to build teaching material in the department...|$|E

40|$|Online {{researchers}} face {{whether to}} use radio buttons or drop downs when presenting respondents with “select one answer from many ” questions. However, empirical evidence regarding response effects does not provide direction for favoring one. Using data collected in a New Zealand gen-eral population Web survey of 2, 400 people, this study contributes to the decision process by investigating format response effects at multiple levels and exploring the potential for input mechanisms to interfere with drop-down answer selection. Format choice did not significantly affect survey completions, number of nonsubstantial answers, or time to completion. However, drop downs led to higher item nonresponse and longer response times. Furthermore, the 76 % of respondents using <b>scroll</b> <b>mice</b> to complete the survey were prone to accidentally changing an answer if presented with drop-down questions. This increased average response times and skewed distribution of responses to the drop-down treatment questions toward {{the bottom of the}} response list. Implications of these findings for Web-based data collection are discussed...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} interactive extensions to two {{recently developed}} templates for displaying geospatially-indexed estimates. The first template, linked micromap plots, links small generalized maps with statistical panels that describe regions. Research centered at the National Cancer Institute addressed {{the task of}} communicating state and county cancer statistics and tailored this template to show estimates, confidence intervals, and Healthy People 2010 target values. The research also integrated interactive options, such as variable selection, sorting, fixed header <b>scrolling,</b> <b>mouse</b> tips, enlarged dynamic map views and drill down, in a Java applet. This template has fared well in early usability tests. The second template, called conditioned choropleth maps, seeks to improve hypothesis generation about the spatial patterns shown in a classed choropleth map. Since variation of a study variable is often related to known risk factors, the template provides a way to control for the known variation. This paper describes dynamic sliders that change class boundaries for a study variable and that partition regions into a 3 x 3 layout of maps based on values of two risk factors. Highlighted regions in each map are more homogeneous with respect to both risk factors. Comparisons across maps and spatial patterns within maps {{provide the basis for}} generating hypotheses.
