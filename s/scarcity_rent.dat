40|$|Since Hotelling's seminal {{paper on}} the optimal {{depletion}} of exhaustible resources, much has been published; yet confusion remains about whether <b>scarcity</b> <b>rent</b> and price increase or decrease as a resource is depleted when costs tend to rise with depletion. We show that Hotelling's fundamental results of rising <b>scarcity</b> <b>rent</b> and price paths are sustained and that the path of <b>scarcity</b> <b>rent</b> converges on the per cent rule, provided the objective function is concave. Predictions of non-monotonic or declining <b>scarcity</b> <b>rent</b> paths are due to implicit assumptions that lead to a non-concave objective function. We identify the sources of these non-concavities. ...|$|E

The average <b>scarcity</b> <b>rent</b> path decreases monotonically. The average <b>scarcity</b> <b>rent</b> is also explicitly determined. Finally, a measure of resource scarcity is obtained {{on the basis of the}} current efficient competitive price of the resource. ...|$|E

The Chicago metropolitan area has nearly depleted its groundwater resources {{to a point where}} interstate conflicts with Wisconsin could accompany an increased reliance on those sources. Further, the withdrawals from Lake Michigan is limited by the Supreme Court decree. The growing demand and indications of possible scarcity suggest a need to reexamine the pricing policies and the dynamics of demand. The study analyses the demand for water and develops estimates of <b>scarcity</b> <b>rents</b> for water in Chicago. The price and income elasticities computed at the means are - 0. 002 and 0. 0002 respectively. The estimated <b>scarcity</b> <b>rents</b> ranges from $ 0. 98 to $ 1. 17 per thousand gallons. The results indicate that the current prices do not fully account for the <b>scarcity</b> <b>rents</b> and suggest a current rate with in the range $ 1. 53 to $ 1. 72 per thousand gallons. ...|$|R
40|$|The double-dividend hypothesis' {{suggests}} that increased taxes on polluting activities can provide {{two kinds of}} benefits. The first is an improvement in the environment, {{and the second is}} an improvement in economic efficiency from the use of environmental tax revenues to reduce other taxes such as income taxes that distort labor supply and saving decisions. In this paper, we make four main points. First, the validity of the double-dividend hypothesis cannot logically be settled as a general matter. Second, the focus on revenue in this literature is misplaced. We demonstrate that three policies have equivalent impacts on the environment and on labor supply. One of those policies raises revenue from the environmental component of the reform, another loses revenue, and a third has no revenue associated with it. Third, what matters is the creation of privately-held <b>scarcity</b> <b>rents.</b> Policies that raise product prices through some restriction on behavior may create <b>scarcity</b> <b>rents.</b> Unless those rents are captured by the government, such policies are less efficient at ameliorating an environmental problem than are policies that do not create rents. Finally, we distinguish between two types of command and control regulations on the basis of whether they create <b>scarcity</b> <b>rents.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Efficient pricing of a {{resource}} incorporates both marginal cost of extraction and <b>scarcity</b> <b>rents.</b> Since groundwater resources exhibit natural supply constraints, <b>scarcity</b> <b>rents</b> {{must be imposed}} on current users. Given the difficulty of establishing clear groundwater ownership rights, scarcity value frequently goes unrecognized and is difficult to estimate. This results in inefficient pricing and misallocation of the resource. This thesis builds on three different methods to develop appropriate theoretical and empirical models relevant for indirect estimation of these shadow <b>scarcity</b> <b>rents,</b> which we consider as the initial and most challenging step towards efficient groundwater management. Empirical analyses are based on economic and hydrological data from t he island of Cyprus, representative of semi-arid regions. Chapter 2 critically assesses previous theoretical and empirical attempts to derive the increase in social benefits from efficient pricing of groundwater and examines the potential for groundwater management. This potential is seriously challenged by Gisser-Sanchez's Effect (GSI) : i. e. net benefits from optimally managing groundwater are insignificant for all practical purposes. Chapter 3 attempts a reexamination of GSI by developing a dynamic model of adaptation to increasing groundwater scarcity, when backstop technology is available. Both groundwater <b>scarcity</b> <b>rents</b> and management benefits are derived by simulating the optimal and competitive-commonality solutions. Results point {{to the absence of}} GSI in aquifers facing complete exhaustion in the near future. Chapter 4 proposes a refinement of revealed preference methods of valuation, by combining the hedonic and travel cost methods, and applies the refined model to derive the willingness to pay for groundwater quality. It is claimed t hat hedonic valuation of quality attributes can be misleading when the exogeneity assumption, with respect to these attributes, to sample selection is violated. Hence, the simultaneity between hedonic valuation and sample selection is modelled in the context of producer behaviour and investigated empirically in the case of land demanded for use as an input either in agricultural production or touristic development. The empirical analysis suggests that failing to correct for sample selection results in a biased valuation of groundwater quality. In chapter 5 duality theory is employed to develop the distance function methodology of deriving shadow groundwater <b>scarcity</b> <b>rents.</b> The empirical application of the model involves estimating a stochastic input distance function from which the in situ shadow price of groundwater is derived. Chapter 6 concludes the thesis by comparing and contrasting the magnitude of groundwater <b>scarcity</b> <b>rents</b> and willingness to pay for scarce groundwater quality, derived from the models put forward in this research. ...|$|R

My ex- tension of the Hotelling-model attributes the behavior of state-owned firms to a <b>scarcity</b> <b>rent,</b> whereas private firms produce at their constant capacity limit, owing to possible expropriation. The theory also indicates that state-owned firms will only switch to a Hotelling-regime after a certain lag time, attributable to limited capacity. The data further reveals that contractions in the supply of state-owned oil lead to oil price increases, indicating that state-owned firms do, in fact, generate a <b>scarcity</b> <b>rent.</b> My results therefore suggest that the shift from private towards state-owned oil dominance in the 1970 s {{gave rise to a}} delayed increasing oil price path...|$|E

This prescriptive principle emerged out of Harold Hotelling’s attempt to demonstrate mathematically how a society optimally conserves a resource assumed to be of a known fixed stock. 2 Optimal conservation is assumed to be a potentially observable state and thus empirically verifiable; hence, neoclassical economists hail the Hotelling Principle as being prospectively operational with the promise of providing a normative basis for “ideal [optimal] standards of resource use by comparisons with which actual outcomes may be judged and on which policies may be based. ” 3 JOHN BRÄTLAND is an economist with the U.
