25|$|Currently (2007) about 219,000 {{cubic metres}} of sand is mined {{each year from}} the {{entrance}} and tidal deltas of the Kaipara. This sand contributes over half the sand requirements for Auckland. The sand {{is used in the}} production of concrete and asphalt, and also in drainage systems and beach nourishment. A <b>suction</b> <b>pump</b> is usually used to extract the sand from the seabed. It is pumped into a barge as a sand and water slurry. As the barge loads, shells and other objects are screened out and the sea water drained back to the sea. The availability of sea sand within the Auckland region means the road costs of transporting sand from further parts of the country are avoided. Concerns about possible negative consequences of this sand mining have also been raised.|$|E
25|$|Liposuction, {{also known}} as lipoplasty, is a {{cosmetic}} surgical procedure that slims and reshapes specific areas of the body by removing excess fat deposits, improving the body's contours and proportion, and ultimately, enhancing the patient's self-image. Liposuction {{involves the use of}} a small stainless steel tube, called a cannula. The cannula is connected to a powerful <b>suction</b> <b>pump</b> and inserted into the fat through small incisions in the skin. Fat removal is accomplished as the suction cannula creates tiny tunnels through the fatty layers. Liposuction can be performed on both men and women. Ideal for this type of procedure are non-smokers, healthy individuals who do not have a life-threatening illness or medical conditions that can impair healing, adults within 30% of their ideal weight who have firm and elastic skin.|$|E
25|$|Mobile Decontamination System: {{with the}} NBC {{aspect of the}} {{battlefield}} in mind, the DRDO developed a Tatra vehicle based Mobile Decontamination system for decontamination of personnel, clothing, equipment, vehicles & terrain during war. The main sub-systems of mobile decontamination system are: pre-wash, chemical wash and post wash systems respectively. The pre-wash system consists of a 3000-litre stainless steel water tank and a fast <b>suction</b> <b>pump.</b> A high-pressure jet with a capacity of 3400 l/hour and a low-pressure jet with a capacity of 900 l/hour and 1600 l/hour are included. The chemical wash system is capable of mixing two powders and two liquids with variable feed rates and has a five-litre per minute slurry emulsion flow rate. The post wash system consists of a high-pressure hot water jet, a hot water shower for personnel and provision of steam for decontamination of clothing. The decontamination systems have been introduced into the services. The system is under production for the Army at DRDO's partnering firms, with the DRDO itself manufacturing the pilot batch.|$|E

25|$|Water {{is drawn}} {{in through the}} mouth by closing the {{operculum}} (gill cover), and enlarging the mouth cavity (Fig. 23). Simultaneously the gill chambers enlarge, producing a lower pressure there than in the mouth causing water to flow over the gills. The mouth cavity then contracts inducing {{the closure of the}} passive oral valves, thereby preventing the back-flow of water from the mouth (Fig. 23). The water in the mouth is, instead, forced over the gills, while the gill chambers contract emptying the water they contain through the opercular openings (Fig. 23). Back-flow into the gill chamber during the inhalatory phase is prevented by a membrane along the ventroposterior border of the operculum (diagram on the left in Fig. 23). Thus the mouth cavity and gill chambers act alternately as <b>suction</b> <b>pump</b> and pressure pump to maintain a steady flow of water over the gills in one direction. Since the blood in the lamellar capillaries flows in the opposite direction to that of the water, the consequent countercurrent flow of blood and water maintains steep concentration gradients for oxygen and carbon dioxide along the entire length of each capillary (lower diagram in Fig.22). Oxygen is therefore able to continually diffuse down its gradient into the blood, and the carbon dioxide down its gradient into the water. Although countercurrent exchange systems theoretically allow an almost complete transfer of a respiratory gas {{from one side of the}} exchanger to the other, in fish less than 80% of the oxygen in the water flowing over the gills is generally transferred to the blood.|$|E

40|$|Around {{the third}} week after {{gestation}} in embryonic development, the human heart consists only of a valvless tube, unlike a fully developed adult heart, which is multi-chambered. At this stage in development, the heart valves have not formed and so net flow of blood through the heart must be driven by a different mechanism. It is hypothesized {{that there are two}} possible mechanisms that drive blood flow at this stage - Liebau <b>pumping</b> (dynamic <b>suction</b> <b>pumping</b> or valveless pumping) and peristaltic pumping. We implement the immersed boundary method with adaptive mesh refinement (IBAMR) to numerically study the effect of hematocrit on the circulation around a valveless. Both peristalsis and dynamic <b>suction</b> <b>pumping</b> are considered. In the case of dynamic <b>suction</b> <b>pumping,</b> the heart and circulatory system is simplified as a flexible tube attached to a relatively rigid racetrack. For some Womersley number (Wo) regimes, there is significant net flow around the racetrack. We find that the addition of flexible blood cells does not significantly affect flow rates within the tube for Wo ≤ 10. On the other hand, peristalsis consistently drives blood around the racetrack for all Wo and for all hematocrit considered. Comment: 21 pages, 19 figure...|$|R
