5|$|New {{legislation}} {{stopped the}} TMB from investigating anonymous complaints concerning physicians {{as of the}} fall of 2011. The change was seen as a victory by physicians rights groups, who <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> promote accountability in the investigations of physicians. Other groups worried that the new law would discourage the reporting of legitimate complaints against physicians. The board received 6,849 complaints in 2010; four percent of the complaints were submitted anonymously.|$|E
5|$|The National Park Service {{originally}} prohibited Capital Bikeshare stations on {{the property}} it manages, including large {{areas such as the}} National Mall. However, the agency later reversed itself and <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> work to include new stations in future expansions. The first two of five approved Capital Bikeshare stations opened on the National Mall on March 16, 2012, shortly {{before the start of the}} 2012 National Cherry Blossom Festival.|$|E
5|$|Nash's father Bob Senior {{collapsed}} {{and died in}} 1958 while at the MCG watching Collingwood win the 1958 VFL Grand Final. Laurie Nash later <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have been the perfect way for his father to die. Nash's brother Bob Junior died of emphysema in the early 1970s, while in 1975 Irene Nash, {{who had been in}} poor health for some time, died, leaving Nash heartbroken. Every day for five years he visited the cemetery where her remains were scattered.|$|E

5|$|On 20 December 2005, Minister for Justice Michael McDowell {{announced}} that he was creating a working group in the Department of Justice to provide options for government consideration. This announcement came on the day after Belfast in Northern Ireland held the first of the new UK civil partnership registration ceremonies. The Government <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> legislate following the report, but Taoiseach Bertie Ahern also said there might not be time to do so before the then upcoming election.|$|E
5|$|Following {{their long}} delay, Babayane, Mshete, Maund and Colenbrander journeyed to England aboard the Moor. They disembarked at Southampton in early March 1889, and {{travelled}} by train to London, where they {{checked into the}} Berners Hotel on Oxford Street. They were invited to Windsor Castle after two days in the capital. The audience was originally meant only for the two izinDuna and their interpreter—Maund could not attend such a meeting as he was a British subject—but Knutsford arranged an exception for Maund when Babayane and Mshete refused to go without him; the Colonial Secretary <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be regrettable for all concerned if the embassy were derailed by such a technicality. The emissaries duly met the Queen and delivered the letter from Lobengula, {{as well as an}} oral message they had been told to pass on.|$|E
5|$|Costa {{scored on}} his Chelsea debut on 27 July, running onto a through ball from Cesc Fàbregas in a 2–1 {{friendly}} win against Slovene club Olimpija. His first competitive match was Chelsea's {{first game of}} the league season, away to Burnley on 18 August, scoring the team's equaliser in a 3–1 victory. He scored in his third consecutive match on 30 August, netting the first and last goals of a 6–3 win at Everton, the first goal coming after 35 seconds. Costa was given the Premier League Player of the Month award for August 2014. He completed his first Premier League hat-trick in his fourth game of the season against Swansea City as Chelsea continued their perfect start to the season with a 4–2 win. With seven, Costa holds the record for most goals in his first four Premier League matches, surpassing the tally of six by both Sergio Agüero and Micky Quinn. In spite of his form {{at the start of the}} season, Costa had been suffering from a recurring hamstring problem which limited his participation in training; manager José Mourinho <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not heal until mid-November.|$|E

5|$|Cuts {{in federal}} {{construction}} funds for Metro again delayed construction. Metro announced in December 1982 that {{service on the}} line would not cross the Anacostia River until late 1989 at the earliest. The federal contribution to Metro's construction fund was lowered to $44 million from $95 million for fiscal 1983, and Metro <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> divert most of that money to dig tunnels from the Gallery Place Station to the Mount Vernon Square station. In February 1983, the Reagan administration proposed cutting Metro's construction budget by $145 million to $230 million, which Metro said would push {{the opening of the}} Green Line to 1991. Metro, {{for the first time in}} its history, formally announced that (absent full construction funding) it could not build the Green Line, the Red Line from Wheaton to Glenmont, or the Yellow Line from Franconia-Springfield to King Street – Old Town.|$|E
5|$|Funding for {{construction}} of the Green Line was threatened again in 1986. WMATA needed $2 billion in construction funds, but Congress was threatening to cut WMATA's funding by up to 26 percent to $184.5 {{million a year for}} four years. Congress approved $227 million for 1986 in December 1985, but the Reagan administration <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> cut off all funding thereafter. WMATA appealed directly to President Reagan to release $400 million in funds already appropriated, but administration officials said WMATA had more than enough money to complete the Green Line. Prince George's County officials threatened to sue Metro as well as block all further construction spending in March 1985 unless WMATA agreed to use its existing funds to build the Green Line into their county. WMATA officials reacted in June by stretching out construction of the Green Line and Anacostia station to 1991. After lengthy negotiations (which included state and local guarantees to pay for cost overruns or funding shortfalls, penalties for defaults, and the imposition of two external financial monitors) and heavy pressure from Congress, Reagan administration officials released the $400 million on July 16, 1986.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the Bracks State Government {{investigated}} {{the construction of}} a heavy rail link to the airport under the Linking Victoria programme. Two options were considered; the first branched off the Craigieburn Suburban Line to the east, and the second branched off the Albion Goods Line, which passes close to the airport's boundary to the south. The second option was preferred. Market research concluded most passengers preferred travelling to the airport by taxi or car, and poor patronage of similar links in Sydney and Brisbane cast doubt on the viability of the project. This led to the project being deferred until at least 2012. On 21 July 2008, the Premier of Victoria reaffirmed the government's commitment to a rail link and <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be considered within three to five years. To maximise future development options, the airport is lobbying for the on-grounds section of the railway to be underground.|$|E

They ciphered out a glacier's gait, and then <b>said</b> {{confidently}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> travel just {{so far in}} so many years. There is record of a striking and curious example of the accuracy which may be attained in these reckonings.|$|R

5|$|Over {{the month}} of July, the Autodromo Nazionale Monza race track's main {{straight}} was straightened and the Variante Goodyear and Seconda Variante chicanes were reconfigured by the race organisers to become a series of narrower corners with the exit away from the entry of turn one. The run-off areas around the two sections of the circuit were enlargened. Some of the drivers, however, were unhappy with the modifications, though, as there were fears of a multi-car accident on the first lap. Coulthard claimed that the new corner would make braking more difficult and was concerned over the amount of penalties issued to other competitors. However, Michael Schumacher believed his and other teams would be less concerned with suspension damage. Jean Alesi {{who was the first}} driver to test the new circuit, <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be easier for drivers to pull off the track {{in the event of a}} technical issue.|$|E
5|$|Two {{months after}} the Anacostia Station opened, WMATA said that a study of bus and rail {{ridership}} showed that the unaltered bus routes were costing the transit agency $200,000 a month in lost rail fares. To make up the lost revenue, WMATA <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> run only two-car trains (the shortest on the system) on the Green Line during slow periods weekdays and evenings and on Sundays beginning in June 1992. In November 1992, WMATA reported that ridership at the Anacostia Station was (on average) 7,500 riders a day, 700 below estimates. WMATA admitted that although riders had made the switch from bus to rail, the lower ridership numbers were due to the recession and not because of continuing downtown bus service in the area. Metro said ridership on buses in the neighborhood was down significantly, and the transit agency {{reduced the number of}} buses on some routes to avoid having empty buses.|$|E
5|$|After the January 11 congressional hearing, Ross delayed {{enforcement}} of the FEPC directive to await {{the outcome of the}} upcoming union elections. The PRTEU contract with the PTC was expiring on February 11, 1944 and a union election was called for March 14, 1944. Apart from PRTEU, which was still staunchly opposed to promotions of black employees, there were two other unions competing for the right to represent PTC workers: the Transport Workers Union (TWU), which was a Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) affiliate, and the Amalgamated Association of Street and Electric Railway and Motor Coach Employees of America, an American Federation of Labor (AFL) affiliate. The TWU <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> allow promotions of black employees while the Amalgamated Association stayed silent on the matter. The PRTEU leadership tried to campaign on the race issue during the union elections, but the topic was overshadowed by other issues, such as the details of a new contract with the PTC. After a bitter campaign, the TWU won the union elections, receiving more votes than both of the other unions combined. At the time of the elections many white workers perceived the contract issue to be more important, where the TWU was promising more attractive terms, and they did not consider promotions of black employees a realistic possibility. Despite the TWU victory, animosities from white workers towards the black employees remained and were largely unabated. The negotiations between the TWU and the PTC on a new contract dragged on, {{and in the absence of}} a contract the company continued to resist implementing the FEPC directives.|$|E
