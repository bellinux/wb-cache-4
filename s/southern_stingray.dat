5|$|Laguna Madre {{is home to}} more finfish than {{anywhere}} else on the Texas coast, with such species as blue catfish, hardhead catfish, Atlantic croaker, black drum, red drum, southern flounder, alligator gar, houndfish, crevalle jack, southern kingfish, ladyfish, Atlantic midshipman, mojarras, striped mullet, pinfish, Florida pompano, smooth butterfly ray, spotted seatrout, blacktip shark, sheepshead, bigmouth sleeper, gray snapper, common snook, southern stargazer, <b>southern</b> <b>stingray</b> and tripletail. Many fowl migrate and live around the lagoon including 75% of all redhead ducks. Other birds in the area include the peregrine falcon, piping plover, roseate spoonbill, long-billed curlew, crane, egret and the brown pelican. Sea turtles and dolphins {{can be found in}} the bay, while cattle, white-tailed deer, nilgai and bobcats can sometimes be seen near the shore.|$|E
5|$|The {{taxonomy}} of the roughtail stingray {{is not fully}} resolved, with the disjunct northwestern Atlantic, southwestern Atlantic, and eastern Atlantic populations differing in life history and perhaps representing a complex of different species. Lisa Rosenberger's 2001 phylogenetic analysis of 14 Dasyatis species, based on morphology, found that the roughtail stingray is the sister species to the broad stingray (D. lata), and that they form a clade with the <b>southern</b> <b>stingray</b> (D. americana) and the longtail stingray (D. longa). The close relationship between the roughtail and southern stingrays was upheld by a genetic analysis published by Leticia de Almeida Leao Vaz and colleagues in 2006. The roughtail and broad stingrays {{are found in the}} Atlantic and Pacific Oceans respectively, and therefore likely diverged before or with the formation of the Isthmus of Panama (c. 3 Ma).|$|E
25|$|Stingray Bay {{opened on}} March 1, 2008, and {{features}} {{several species of}} rays housed in a 17,000-gallon, 30-by- saltwater pool, guests are able to touch and feed both cownose ray, <b>southern</b> <b>stingray,</b> and Atlantic stingray. The exhibit replaced the Camel Rides in the same location near the Great Plains of East Africa. In 2011, the zoo took its operation over fully from an outside contractor, allowing the exhibit to stay open year-round. There is an additional fee to enter this exhibit.|$|E

500|$|The pelvic fins {{have nearly}} {{straight}} margins and angular tips. The tail {{is long and}} whip-like, measuring some 2.5 times {{the length of the}} disc. A long, saw-toothed spine is placed atop the tail at around half a disc length back from the tail base; sometimes one or two replacement spines are also present in front of the existing one. Behind the spine, there is a long ventral fin fold that is much lower than that of the <b>southern</b> <b>stingray.</b> Individuals under [...] across have completely smooth skin. Larger rays develop increasing numbers of distinctive tubercles or bucklers (flat-based thorns) over the middle of the back from the snout to the tail base, as well as dorsal and lateral rows of thorns on the tail. The bucklers vary in size, with the largest of equal diameter to the eye, and may bear up to three thorns each. This species is a uniform dark brown or olive above, and off-white below without dark fin margins. Among the largest members of its family, the roughtail stingray can reach [...] across, [...] long, and [...] in weight. Females grow larger than males.|$|E

50|$|The <b>southern</b> <b>{{stingray}}</b> (Dasyatis americana) is a whiptail stingray {{found in}} tropical and subtropical {{waters of the}} Western Atlantic Ocean from New Jersey to southern Brazil. It has a flat, diamond-shaped disc, with a mud brown, olive, and grey dorsal surface and white underbelly (ventral surface). The barb on its tail is serrated and covered in a venomous mucous, used for self-defense.|$|E

The bay serves as a nursery for finfish, shrimp and crabs.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>southern</b> <b>stingray</b> {{is adapted}} {{for life on}} the sea bed. The flattened, {{diamond-shaped}} body has sharp corners, making it more angular than the discs of other rays. [...] The top of the body varies between olive brown and green in adults, dark grey in juveniles, whilst the underside is predominantly white. The wing-like pectoral fins are used to propel the stingray across the ocean bottom, whilst the slender tail possesses a long, serrated and venomous spine at the base, used for defence. These spines are not fatal to humans, but are incredibly painful if stepped on. The eyes are situated {{on top of the}} head of the <b>southern</b> <b>stingray,</b> along with small openings called spiracles. The location of the spiracles enables the stingray to take in water whilst lying on the seabed, or when partially buried in sediment. Water enters the spiracles and leaves through the gill openings, bypassing the mouth which is on the underside. Female stingrays can grow to a disc width of 150 cm, contrary to the smaller male stingrays that reach maximum size at 67 cm.|$|E
