40|$|Abstract [...] The {{substitution}} of non-renewable energy by renewable energy as electricity supply is an emerging trend {{for development of}} smart houses nowadays. For example, solar photovoltaic (PV) panels, rechargeable batteries, external power supply, and power-consuming houses have formed a distributed micro-smart-grid. The traditional energy management system (EMS) for such a micro-smart-grid is, however, based on <b>static</b> <b>demand</b> model. As such, the resource (solar energy) cannot be optimally allocated to each house with real-time adjustment when the battery profile is different. In order to achieve high utilization rate of solar-energy, we propose a cyber-physical controller for real-time EMS of smart houses in this paper. Based on physically sensed battery profile, one cyber-physical controller enables the resource to be shared between different houses. The micro-smart-grid is modeled by decentralized multi-supplier and multi-customer system. The proposed real-time EMS is formulated based on the modified minority-game (MG) algorithm such that the task (or EU load) can be allocated with balanced distribution and hence improved utilization rate. The experiment {{results show that the}} proposed EMS can increase the solar energy utilization rate by 12. 78 % on average (up to 20 %) when compared to the traditional design under the <b>static</b> <b>demand</b> model. Moreover, the load balancing of tasks (or customers) on each battery (or supplier) is significantly improved. For example, the average standard deviation of the load of tasks on batteries in each month is reduced from. (<b>static</b> <b>demand</b> model) to. ૢ (proposed model). The improved load balancing can further prolong lifetime of batteries. Index Terms [...] Solar energy, batteries, energy management...|$|E

Cloud service provisioning and cost optimization based on <b>static</b> <b>demand,</b> price and availability have been discussed in [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], where [12, 13] deal with the uncertainty in the demand, price and availability of cloud services.|$|E
40|$|Many traffic {{engineering}} problems consist of evaluating {{a number of}} alternate schemes in terms of some measures of performance, such as total travel time, volume to capacity ratio, average speed, total fuel consumption, total emissions, etc. These evaluations generally require prior knowledge of the temporal trip making behaviour of drivers by origin and destination. This thesis presents the development, application, and evaluation of two models capable of inferring these temporal origin- destination (O-D) traffic demands {{on the basis of}} observed link traffic flows and assumptions regarding drivers' route choices. In particular, this thesis presents the development and evaluation of a Least Squared Error (LSE) and a Least Relative Error (LRE) model, each of which is capable of estimating either <b>static</b> <b>demands,</b> a time series of <b>static</b> <b>demands,</b> or dynamic demands. Furthermore, the potential of using probe data, from route guidance system (RGS) equipped vehicles, to enhance these estimated dynamic O-D demands is examined. Both of the LSE and LRE models' mathematical formulations are presented. The LS...|$|R

40|$|Certain {{problems}} in comparative statics, including (but not exclusively) certain {{problems in}} consumer theory, cannot be easily {{addressed by the}} methods of lattice programming. One {{reason for this is}} that there is no order on the choice space which orders choices in a way which conforms with the comparison desired, and which also orders constraint sets in the strong set order it induces. The objective of this paper is to show how lattice progamming theory can be extended to deal with situations like these. We show that the interaction of concavity and supermodularity in objective or constraint functions yield a structure that is very useful for comparative statics. lattices, concavity, supermodularity, comparative <b>statics,</b> <b>demand,</b> normality...|$|R

30|$|It is {{to mention}} that the {{inventory}} levels in this model are determined based on a <b>static</b> <b>demand</b> deviation which represents a simplifying assumption. Stößlein et al. [81] detected empirically that safety stocks, which account for about 20  % of all inventory, can be reduced by about 5  % in the FMCG industry when dynamic deviations are taken into account. As a consequence, the inventory levels in this study show an inaccuracy of about 1  %. Nevertheless, the overall conclusions drawn from the numerical analysis presented in this paper remain valid.|$|E
40|$|There is {{overwhelming}} evidence, particularly from echocardiography, that {{the heart of}} athletes may differ from that of nonathletes matched for age, gender, and body size. Left ventricular mass was larger in most studies in athletes performing predominantly dynamic aerobic and anaerobic sports, in some groups of strength athletes engaged in static training, and in players of ball sports. There is good evidence that the end-diastolic left ventricular internal diameter is enlarged in competitive athletes who perform predominantly dynamic sports, but not in strength-training athletes, which is explained by the different volume load on the heart. There is more uncertainty on left ventricular wall thickening. In sports with high dynamic and low <b>static</b> <b>demands</b> wall thickness is usually proportional {{to the size of}} the internal diameter, so that relative wall thickness is not different from control (eccentric hypertrophy). In strength athletes the expected increase in wall thickness without internal diameter change (concentric hypertrophy) was not always observed, possibly related to the variable duration and intensity of the pressure load. In some dynamic sports with high <b>static</b> <b>demands</b> and requiring prolonged training, such as cycling, relative wall thickness may increase. Most studies agree that left ventricular systolic and diastolic function, as measured by various noninvasive techniques, is normal in all types of athletes. The consistency of the results of studies on athletes in the competitive and the resting season, of training of sedentary subjects, and of spinal cord injured patients suggests that variations in physical activity can alter left ventricular structure; genetic factors do not seem to be involved in the size of the left ventricular internal diameter, but have to be taken into account to interpret wall thickness. status: publishe...|$|R

We show that, in a network environment, pricing below marginal cost {{may be required to}} reach critical mass, and competition could represent an obstacle to network development rather than being its driving force. ...|$|E
40|$|During severe seismic events {{the base}} of unanchored steel liquid-storage tanks can uplift causing large inelastic {{rotation}} demands and possible low-cycle fatigue failure at the shell-to-base connections. Current code provisions limit uplift rotations to 0. 2 rad; however, limited research exists on the rotation capacity of shell-to-base connections.

Uplift histories from design-level earthquake motions are applied to two axi-symmetric finite element models representing two tank geometries (broad and slender tanks), and fatigue damage is assessed using a calibrated stress modified critical strain low-cycle fatigue criterion.

The commodity composition effect and market distribution effect were somewhat unfavorable; it was - 29 and 1 percent, respectively. The CMS results suggest that, to obtain more benefit from the world trade in forest products, Indonesian export strategy must shift gradually to the commodities which are highly demanded, in particular paper and paperboard, newsprint, printing and writing papers. Further investigation revealed that the <b>static</b> <b>demand</b> for export model seems to explain better than the dynamic model in relation to the behavior of the Indonesian sawn wood and plywood exports to various markets. In addition, the results for the sawn wood demand for exports are richer statistically than that of plywood. In the world market, the share of Indonesian sawn wood exports was far less compared with that of plywood. The estimated price elasticities of the <b>static</b> <b>demand</b> for Indonesian sawn wood exports revealed that 9 out of 17 export markets under investigation have elasticities greater than one (3 ̆e 1. 0), and are significant statistically.
