5|$|During {{a hearing}} on May 6 before Justice Lawrence, Austin was held on a bond of $1,500, which {{he was unable to}} pay. After {{pleading}} guilty to larceny, he was sentenced on May 12 to three years' imprisonment.

Aue meets him in Ukraine during the German offensive against the Soviet Union. They both take part in battle of Stalingrad and successfully escape before the German surrender. They reunite in Berlin, with Hohenegg revealing to Max how he <b>saved</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> by convincing doctors at Stalingrad to operate on him and transport him back to Germany, rather than leaving him for dead. He is depicted at different points in the book.|$|E

5|$|A {{plot against}} {{his life was}} revealed, {{and one of his}} officers, Philotas, was {{executed}} for failing to alert Alexander. The death of the son necessitated the death of the father, and thus Parmenion, who had been charged with guarding the treasury at Ecbatana, was assassinated at Alexander's command, to prevent attempts at vengeance. Most infamously, Alexander personally killed the man who had <b>saved</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> at Granicus, Cleitus the Black, during a violent drunken altercation at Maracanda (modern day Samarkand in Uzbekistan), in which Cleitus accused Alexander of several judgmental mistakes and most especially, of having forgotten the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I in 1914, Bennett volunteered to serve with the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) and, after securing his release from AMP on full pay, was appointed second-in-command of the 6th Battalion, {{which was part of}} the 2nd (Victorian) Infantry Brigade, assigned to the 1st Division. After a short period of training, the 1st Division began to embark for Europe. Just prior to his departure overseas, Bennett became engaged to Bess Buchanan, who he had met at a dance in Canterbury. As an engagement gift, Bess bought her betrothed a miniature photo of herself, set in a gold frame. Bennett carried the picture in his jacket pocket while serving overseas and it later <b>saved</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> on the Western Front, deflecting a German bullet.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the heated}} {{political}} {{environment of the}} Old Court-New Court controversy, allies of his father claimed that the governor's political enemies had framed his son. The governor's legislative allies passed legislation providing for a favorable change of venue for the trial, and the governor used his appointment power to ensure that sympathetic judges would hear the case. Isaac Desha was twice convicted, but both times, {{the judge in the}} case set aside the verdict on procedural grounds. While awaiting a third trial, Desha attempted suicide by slitting his throat, but doctors <b>saved</b> <b>his</b> <b>life,</b> reconnecting his severed windpipe with a silver tube. Shortly after the suicide attempt, Governor Desha issued a pardon for his son.|$|E

5|$|Later that year, Galland {{tracked down}} his mechanic, Gerhard Meyer, who had {{installed}} the armour that <b>saved</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> in 1941. On 25 June 1983, he entertained them {{at his home}} in Oberwinter, Remagen on the river Rhine. They were invited every year until Galland's death. In early February 1996, Galland was taken seriously ill. He had wanted to die at home and so was released from hospital and returned to his own house. With his wife Heidi, son and daughter present, he was given the last rites. Adolf Galland died at 01:15 in the morning of Tuesday, 9 February 1996. Galland was buried at St Laurentius Church, Oberwinter on 21 February. A memorial service was held on 31 March.|$|E
5|$|They {{arrive at}} a cave. Tintin ventures inside and finds Chang, who is feverish and shaking. The Yeti {{suddenly}} appears, revealed as a large anthropoid, reacting with anger at Tintin's attempt to take Chang. As it lunges at Tintin, the flash bulb of Tintin's camera goes off, and scares the Yeti away. Chang tells Tintin that the Yeti <b>saved</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> after the crash. Upon returning to inhabited lands, the friends are surprised to be met by the Grand Abbot, who presents Tintin with a khata in honour of the bravery he has shown for his friend Chang. As the party travels home, Chang muses that the Yeti is not a wild animal, but has a human soul. The Yeti sadly watches their departure from a distance.|$|E
5|$|With World War I {{raging in}} Europe, Szilard {{received}} notice on January 22, 1916, {{that he had}} been drafted into the 5th Fortress Regiment, but he was able to continue his studies. He enrolled as an engineering student at the Palatine Joseph Technical University, which he entered in September 1916. The following year he joined the Austro-Hungarian Army's 4th Mountain Artillery Regiment, but immediately was sent to Budapest as an officer candidate. He rejoined his regiment in May 1918 but in September, before being sent to the front, he fell ill with Spanish Influenza and was returned home for hospitalization. Later he was informed that his regiment had been nearly annihilated in battle, so the illness probably <b>saved</b> <b>his</b> <b>life.</b> He was discharged honorably in November 1918, {{after the end of the}} war.|$|E

5|$|Discovering that Vanessa is {{actually}} Ursula in disguise, Scuttle informs Ariel of Ursula's plan to marry Eric while Sebastian informs Triton about Ursula's actions. Assisted by her friends, Ariel stops Eric's wedding to Ursula, destroying the nautilus shell around Ursula's neck and restoring Ariel's voice. Realizing that Ariel is {{the girl who}} <b>saved</b> <b>his</b> <b>life,</b> Eric rushes to kiss her, but the sun sets, and Ariel transforms back into a mermaid before Ursula kidnaps her. Triton furiously confronts Ursula and demands Ariel's release, but the deal is inviolable. Ursula tricks Triton into taking Ariel's place as Ursula's prisoner, giving up his trident. Ariel is released as Triton {{is transformed into a}} polyp. Ursula steps forward as the new queen, but before she can use the trident, Eric intervenes with a harpoon. Ursula attempts to attack Eric, but inadvertently kills Flotsam and Jetsam in the process. Enraged, Ursula uses the trident to expand into monstrous proportions.|$|E
5|$|In July 1826, Isaac Desha, free on bail while {{awaiting}} a third trial and apparently {{in a highly}} intoxicated state, attempted suicide by cutting his own throat. Physicians <b>saved</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> by reconnecting his severed windpipe with a silver tube. He recovered, and in June 1827, faced a third trial. During the June term of the court, Desha's lawyers used a number of peremptory challenges to again prevent the court from empaneling a jury. The judge ordered him held without bail until the next session of the court, but Governor Desha, who {{was present at the}} proceedings, stood and issued a pardon for his son, as well as lambasting the judge in a lengthy impromptu speech. Some accounts hold that the governor immediately resigned upon granting the pardon, but the official records reflect no such action.|$|E
5|$|John Kramer's widow Jill Tuck meets Matt Gibson, an {{internal}} affairs detective from the precinct where Detective Mark Hoffman works. She incriminates Hoffman {{in exchange for}} protection and immunity from prosecution. Gibson, who has distrusted Hoffman ever since he <b>saved</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> by gunning down a homeless man, agrees to her terms. Meanwhile, Hoffman abducts a skinhead gang – Dan, Evan, Jake and Kara – and places them in a junkyard trap that kills them all, leaving the reverse bear trap at the scene to incriminate Jill, who is later put into protective custody. After a meeting of Jigsaw survivors, including Lawrence Gordon, who cauterized his leg on a steam pipe after escaping the bathroom and now uses a cane and prosthetic foot, Hoffman abducts Bobby Dagen, a self-help guru who achieved fame and fortune by falsifying his own survival story. He sends Gibson some videos with cryptic clues to the game's location, offering to end the games if Jill is given to him.|$|E

5|$|The High Court quickly {{assembled}} at Nikli. Guy de la Roche {{presented himself}} before it {{accompanied by his}} own knights, but the assembled barons decided {{that they did not}} have the authority to judge him, and referred the matter to King Louis IX of France (r. 1226–1270). Guy travelled to France in 1259, but Louis not only pardoned him, but awarded him the title of Duke, which he and his successors were to bear thereafter. The renegade Geoffroy de Bruyères too was brought for judgement before William, and it was only the determined and passionate intercession of the other barons that <b>saved</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> and secured a pardon from the vengeful prince. He was however deprived of the possession of his domains by the inalienable right of conquest, and retained them henceforth as a gift from the Prince, meaning that they would be forfeit upon his death unless he had any immediate descendants.|$|E
5|$|In June 1968, Plante {{was drafted}} by the St. Louis Blues and signed for $35,000 for the 1968–69 season. In his first season with the Blues, Plante split the goaltending duties with Glenn Hall. He won the Vezina Trophy that season for the seventh time, surpassing Bill Durnan's record. While playing for the Blues in the 1969–70 playoffs against the Boston Bruins, a shot fired by Fred Stanfield and {{redirected}} by Phil Esposito hit Plante in the forehead, knocking him out and breaking his fibreglass mask. The first thing Plante said after he regained consciousness at the hospital was that the mask <b>saved</b> <b>his</b> <b>life.</b> That game proved to be his last for the Blues, and he was traded {{in the summer of}} 1970 to the Toronto Maple Leafs. He led the NHL with the lowest goals against average (GAA) during his first season with the Maple Leafs. At season's end, he was named to the NHL's second All-Star team, his seventh such honour. He continued to play for the Leafs until he was traded to the Boston Bruins late in the 1972–73 season, recording a shutout against the Black Hawks in his debut for the Bruins. He played eight regular season and two playoff games for the Bruins to finish that season, his last in the NHL.|$|E
5|$|LeMond {{had planned}} to defend his title in the 1987 Tour de France with La Vie Claire, but {{he was unable to}} participate. Earlier that year, while riding in the Tirreno–Adriatico spring tune-up race, LeMond fell and {{fractured}} his left wrist. He returned to the United States to recover from the injury. The week before returning to Europe, he went turkey hunting on a ranch co-owned by his father in Lincoln, California – in the Sacramento Valley of Northern California. LeMond was with Rodney Barber and Patrick Blades, his uncle and brother-in-law. The trio had become separated when Blades, who heard movement behind him, turned and fired through a bush. The movement had come from LeMond, who was hit in his back and right side with a devastating blast of approximately 60 No. 2-sized pellets. LeMond's injuries were life-threatening, but fortunately, a police helicopter was already airborne near the scene and transported LeMond on a 15-minute air medical flight to the Medical Center at University of California-Davis. LeMond was taken for emergency surgery. He had suffered a pneumothorax to his right lung and extensive bleeding, having lost some 65 percent of his blood volume. A physician informed LeMond later that he had been within 20 minutes of bleeding to death. The operation <b>saved</b> <b>his</b> <b>life,</b> but four months later he developed a small bowel obstruction due to adhesions that had formed following the shooting. He underwent another surgery to relieve the obstruction and take down the adhesions. Concerned that his team would drop him if they knew the shooting accident required a second surgery, LeMond asked the surgeons to remove his appendix at the same time. He then informed his team that he had had his appendix removed, {{but the rest of the}} story was left somewhat vague. The events effectively ended his 1987 season, and in October he announced he would return to serious competition the following February, with the Dutch PDM team.|$|E
