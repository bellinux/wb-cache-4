50|$|The Stadtbrauerei <b>Spalt</b> (<b>Spalt</b> City Brewery in German) is a brewery in the Middle Franconian town of <b>Spalt</b> {{which was}} created in the year 1879 through the merger of {{numerous}} smaller breweries.|$|E

50|$|<b>Spalting</b> is {{any form}} of wood {{coloration}} caused by fungi. Although primarily found in dead trees, <b>spalting</b> can also occur in living trees under stress. Although <b>spalting</b> can cause weight loss and strength loss in the wood, the unique coloration and patterns of <b>spalted</b> wood are sought after by woodworkers.|$|R
30|$|One of {{the most}} {{promising}} wood value-added processes currently under development is <b>spalting,</b> where pigment is added to wood via fungal colonization. Previous studies have shown laboratory level <b>spalting</b> to be achievable and highly predictable. However, large-scale <b>spalting</b> for potential commercial applications introduces a substantial number of additional variables which impact the <b>spalting</b> process. To test the potential of commercial-scale <b>spalting,</b> Acer saccharum, Fagus grandifolia, and Populus tremuloides logs were inoculated with multiple known <b>spalting</b> fungi utilizing both liquid spray cultures and live dowel pin cultures. Many of the fungi that successfully produce <b>spalting</b> in small, sterile cultures also produced significant amounts in large logs, with many <b>spalting</b> patterns identical to those found in small-scale testing. Pairings of Trametes versicolor/Scytalidium cuboideum and Xylaria polymorpha/Xylaria polymorpha (different isolates) produced significant amounts of zone lines. In addition, the method of inoculation impacted the amount of spalting: more zone lines were produced when fungi were introduced via plugs, while more stain was produced when liquid cultures were sprayed onto the logs. These results indicate that many of the standard <b>spalting</b> fungi are suitable for large-scale applications; however, the inoculation method appears to be a vital component for successful <b>spalting</b> under a restricted time schedule.|$|R
30|$|Hence, {{there is}} {{a larger number of}} {{variables}} to account for when <b>spalting</b> large pieces of wood, especially if <b>spalting</b> on a commercial scale. In order to mass-produce <b>spalted</b> wood to meet growing consumer demands, methods must be developed that allow for quick, mass-scale inoculation of logs to produce penetrating pigments within the wood. The purpose of this research was to investigate methods for the inoculation of sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh), Norway maple (Acer platanoides L.), American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.), and aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) logs with several well-established <b>spalting</b> fungi, and establish log inoculation methods that (1) minimize external contamination, (2) are easy to apply to large volumes of logs, and (3) produce at least 5  % total area <b>spalting</b> coverage throughout the log sapwood. The applications of this research should enable lumber retailers and log yard owners to mass-induce <b>spalting</b> in their wood, allowing for <b>spalted</b> wood to become a viable value-added product for businesses across the globe.|$|R

30|$|Although <b>spalted</b> wood {{has been}} used in artistic endeavors for centuries [1], its use in modern design is only {{beginning}} to materialize [2, 3]. However, there is an increasingly growing market demand for <b>spalted</b> wood, and the product is sold at a price premium by speciality lumber retailers. With the growing consumer interest in <b>spalted</b> wood, various {{attempts have been made to}} both understand the processes behind <b>spalting</b> and to induce the pigmentation under controlled conditions [3]. It is currently understood that the black line type <b>spalting</b> (‘zone lines’) is generally produced via inter- and/or intra-fungal antagonism, and that many of the bright pigment type <b>spalting</b> is due to extracellular pigments produced by the fungi as mechanisms of resource capture/protection [3]. To date, a small group of fungi have been identified as reliable pigment producers on wood, and several inoculation and incubation methods have been established.|$|R
5000|$|Initial {{lab work}} was {{conducted}} on <b>spalting</b> in the 1980s at Brigham Young University. A method for improving machinability in <b>spalted</b> wood using methyl methacrylate was developed in 1982, and several white rot fungi responsible for zone line formation were identified in 1987. [...] Current research at Michigan Technological University has identified specific time periods at which certain <b>spalting</b> fungi will interact, {{and how long it}} takes for said fungi to render the wood useless. [...] Researchers from this university also developed a test for evaluating the machinability of <b>spalted</b> wood using a universal test machine.|$|R
30|$|Although {{there are}} several well-tested methods for {{controlled}} <b>spalting</b> of hardwoods, the methods are specific for jar or bin incubation [4, 5]. This type of incubation is not suitable for commercial <b>spalting</b> production, as large amounts of wood, in larger sizes, need to be <b>spalted</b> {{in order to make}} the process economical. Insuring sterility is an additional hurdle with large-scale <b>spalting</b> that is not encountered with jar <b>spalting.</b> Small pieces of wood, and to some extent their incubation containers, can be completely sterilized utilizing an autoclave. Autoclaving is not possible for large numbers of logs, and certainly not possible for the chambers in which these logs are incubated. The lack of sterility affects not only the initial colonization of the target fungi, but also the behavior of the target fungi once inoculated, as other fungi may be present within the log, and will affect the actions of the inoculated fungus.|$|R

40|$|The lengthy {{time periods}} {{required}} by current <b>spalting</b> methods prohibit the economically viable commercialization of <b>spalted</b> wood {{on a large}} scale. This work aimed to compare the effects of induced <b>spalting</b> in 16 Pacific Northwest woods using three common <b>spalting</b> fungi, Chlorociboria aeruginosa, Scytalidium cuboideum, and Scytalidium ganodermophthorum, with the significantly less time-consuming treatment of these woods using dichloromethane-extracted green, red, and yellow pigments from the same fungi. For pigment extracts, the dosage required for a pigment to internally color various wood species to 30 % internal coverage was investigated. With few exceptions, treatment with pigment extracts outperformed induced <b>spalting</b> in terms of percent internal color coverage. Cottonwood consistently performed best with all three pigment solutions, although chinkapin performed as well as cottonwood with the red pigment, and Port Orford cedar performed {{as well with the}} yellow pigment. While no wood species showed 30 % internal color coverage with the green pigment solution, a number of additional species, including pacific silver fir, madrone, dogwood, and mountain hemlock showed internal color coverage on the order of 20 – 30 % for red and/or yellow. Cottonwood was determined to be the best suited wood species for this type of <b>spalting</b> application...|$|R
30|$|The {{literature}} {{indicates that}} red pine {{is commonly used}} for fungal cultivation in log form [14], but poplar species, maple, and oak [20] are also utilized. Of the wood species tested in this research, the maple species performed well with their associated inoculated fungi, while the beech logs performed well only after extended incubation. The aspen logs did not perform well, and showed very little <b>spalting.</b> The maples performed well with the zone line producing fungi in particular, while S. cuboideum {{did not appear to}} have a preference among any of the wood species, nor did the separate isolate pairing of X. polymorpha. Maple logs showed the most <b>spalting</b> in terms of wood species when inoculated with S. cuboideum/T. versicolor, although the amount of <b>spalting</b> was not significantly different than for several other pairings in beech. However, beech logs took almost twice the length of time to achieve the same level of <b>spalting.</b> This is very likely a similar effect as noted in Robinson et al. [8], where the higher amounts of beech heartwood either inhibited or obfuscated <b>spalting,</b> unless a white-rot fungus was utilized to first lighten the wood. As the fungal pairings that did produce <b>spalting</b> on beech all involved at least one white-rot capable fungus, it is probable that the extra time required by the beech logs to show <b>spalting</b> was taken by X. polymorpha lightening the wood, before other pigments could be seen.|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} using fungal-colored wood (<b>spalted</b> wood) for {{marquetry}} and intarsia woodworks in Italy and Germany was very popular from the 1400 – 1600 s, with some instances continuing {{as late as}} the 1800 s. While <b>spalted</b> marquetry in these countries is relatively well documented, less is known about its use in other parts of Europe. One of the primary reasons for this lack of knowledge is the difficulty in identifying <b>spalted</b> wood, especially the blue-green variety produced from Chlorociboria species, from wood dyed with copper-based compounds or other synthetics. The most reliable testing method involves destructive sampling, where a small piece is taken from the work, the pigment extracted, and an analysis performed. Such sampling is simply not feasible, nor often allowed, on ancient artwork. To make a reliable, non-destructive identification of <b>spalted</b> wood, a visual method based on anatomical characteristics of <b>spalted</b> wood was developed to differentiate <b>spalted</b> wood from dyed wood. High-resolution pictures were taken from wooden artifacts containing blue-green colored wood in collections at the National Museum of Decorative Arts (MNAD), the Royal Site Monastery El Escorial and the Bilbao Museum of Fine Arts in Spain. The concentration of pigment in the rays, the color distribution, the size of the piece and the date of production, were analyzed. With the use of this new visual method, it was possible to determine that intarsia artifacts, held in Spain but of Augsburg origin from the 1500 – 1600 s, contained <b>spalted</b> wood details. Meanwhile, Spanish and Italian intarsia artifacts from the 1800 s were found to only contain dyed wood...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from January 24, 2017 - December 1, 2017 <b>Spalting</b> fungi show strong potential as natural colorants {{on a variety of}} materials, specifically textiles and wood. Four species of <b>spalting</b> fungi are currently utilized in this manner: Scytalidium cuboideum, which produces a red pigment called draconin red, Scytalidium ganodermophthorum, that produces an unknown yellow pigment, and Chlorociboria aeruginosa and Chlorociboria aeruginascens, that both produce a blue-green pigment known as xylindein. This research expanded the known <b>spalting</b> fungi through surveys in the Peruvian Amazon rainforest, and found similarities with temperate fungi in terms of classification (orders such as the Helotiales and Xylariales and genera, such as Scytalidium and Xylaria). Extracts from known <b>spalting</b> fungi were also tested on a new substrate, bamboo, and performed well as a top coating finish. Finally, microscopic analysis of the known <b>spalting</b> fungal pigments with light microscopy (LM), confocal microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and focused ion beam (FIB) showed evidence that the extracted pigments bind to the materials where they are applied, although the type of structures formed when adhering to the substrate surface varies by species. Interestingly, the S. cuboideum pigment showed crystal-like structures. These were confirmed with a Kikuchi diffraction test and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to be an organic crystal. An X-ray diffraction test is required to obtain detailed information about this crystal, but this crystal is likely novel to science, {{and one of the few}} naphthoquinone organic crystals produced by a microorganism. The work herein represents a detailed analysis of the physical structure and binding ability of pigments extracted from <b>spalting</b> fungi—information which may be of use to manufacturers interested in replacing synthetic colorants with natural ones. The research also increases the number of known <b>spalting</b> fungi, and continued research in this field should lead to additional colors being available for extraction and study in the future...|$|R

For the direct application of fungal pigments, bamboo did not develop internal pigmentation with any pigment, but did develop visible surface color for S. cuboideium and C. aeruginosa. Light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy confirmed the presence of hyphae in bamboo vessels and parenchyma. An HPLC analysis for simple sugars showed the presence of glucose but no sucrose.
