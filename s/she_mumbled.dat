6000|$|... "Ah! the traitor! the traitor!" [...] <b>she</b> <b>mumbled,</b> almost inaudibly. [...] "Now we {{are going}} to be burnt; and I bent my knee to him. No! he must run at the heels of his English." ...|$|E
6000|$|The maid stared dumbly at him, looked suspiciously at Mother. Apparently {{she decided}} that, though the {{flamboyant}} Father {{was likely to}} steal everything in the house, Mother was a person to be trusted, and <b>she</b> <b>mumbled,</b> [...] "Yass, I gass so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "God bless you!" [...] <b>she</b> <b>mumbled,</b> and set {{off before}} him {{down the stairs and}} out of the door. She looked so miserably old and weary that he called a gondola to his landing and made her get into it with him.|$|E
6000|$|Sometimes {{she could}} not go to sleep, even when worn out with fatigue, because her rage boiled so high over the day's {{experiences}} with her boy. <b>She</b> would <b>mumble</b> and mutter to herself: ...|$|R
6000|$|The horrible {{old woman}} grinned still more odiously and maliciously in reply. [...] "Gone out," [...] <b>she</b> answered, <b>mumbling</b> her words in her toothless mouth so that I could hardly make them out or {{understand}} them.|$|R
5000|$|Clary goes to {{the club}} with her best friend, Simon Lewis, where she sees a blue haired boy and a black haired girl sneak into a storeroom, pursued by two other boys; one armed with {{what appears to be}} a knife. She sends Simon for help and she follows the group into the storeroom, where she {{witnesses}} the blue haired [...] "boy" [...] being killed; whereupon he vanishes from the room, with the explanation that demons [...] "return to their home dimensions when they die." [...] Simon enters the storeroom with the bouncer in tow and questions why she is there alone; and realizing no one else can see the others, <b>she</b> <b>mumbles</b> an apology.|$|R
60|$|There was unbelief in the woman's eyes--unbelief and {{a horror}} of the whole disgraceful affair that somehow {{included}} Mary Louise in its scope. The girl read this look and it confused her. <b>She</b> <b>mumbled</b> an excuse and fled to her room to indulge in a good cry.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank God!" [...] {{cried the}} little old woman. [...] "I {{did not know}} whether I myself might speak it so that another could understand. For sixty years I have spoken only their accursed gibberish. For sixty years I have not heard a word in my native language. Poor creature! Poor creature!" [...] <b>she</b> <b>mumbled.</b> [...] "What accursed misfortune threw you into their hands?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She was {{a little}} soured at losing by his {{marriage}} so profitable a tenant as the surgeon had proved to be duling his residence under her roof; and the more so in there being hardly the remotest chance of her getting such another settler in the Hintock solitudes.

6000|$|Alice Akana {{was in an}} ecstasy or {{hysteria}} of terror. <b>She</b> was <b>mumbling</b> incoherently: [...] "O Lord, I {{will give}} nine-tenths of my all. I will give all.

40|$|A coworker {{comes to}} you to talk about another worker, Jane. Jane seems “out of it ” lately. <b>She</b> <b>mumbles</b> and her eyes look red and out of focus. Sometimes she cannot even walk {{straight}} down the hall. My coworkers and I have talked about this during breaks. We think that Jane is an alcoholic and occasionally comes to work drunk. From my past experience with alcoholics, they don’t realize they have a problem. At your tables: 1. Identify: Observation or observable “data ” or {{it might have been}} a “trigger ” statement for you The Spin or your thoughts Action the co-workers took 2. What else might be causing the observations of the co-workers? I take action based on my beliefs I’ll never say “hi ” to her again...|$|R

6000|$|... "To Sacramento, I guess. I {{advised her}} not to go, but <b>she</b> <b>mumbled</b> {{something}} about not havin' him buried in sich a wild place, an' layin' him in a churchyard; so I gave her the loan o' fifty dollars--it was all I could spare--for she hadn't a rap. She borrowed the horse and cart from a countryman, who was goin' to Sacramento at any rate." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{old woman}} herself {{did nothing to}} attract public notice till they were midway between Seventh and Eighth avenues. <b>She</b> <b>mumbled</b> {{something}} {{from time to time}} which the colored girl interpreted to the rest as her continued wish to go home. She was now clearer about her street and number. The girl, as if after question of her own generous spirit, said she did not see how she could go with her; she was expected at home herself.|$|E
6000|$|She {{was engaged}} in pulling onions in the little garden before her daughter's cottage {{when she saw him}} coming through the garden gate. She stood for a moment [...] "consternated," [...] as the country folks say, and then folded her arms, and with the little bunch of onions held defensively under her left elbow, awaited his approach. Her mouth opened and shut several times; <b>she</b> <b>mumbled</b> her {{remaining}} tooth, and once quite suddenly she curtsied, like the blink of an arc-light.|$|E
5000|$|Suddenly, Joy Birch {{is found}} drugged but alive. Dover visits {{her in the}} {{hospital}} to ask for information. Her memories are confused but <b>she</b> <b>mumbles,</b> [...] "You were there" [...] to Dover. He then realizes that Joy may have heard his voice at the Jones' house when he visited Holly, and runs from the police. Loki searches for Dover at the apartment building and discovers Alex. Dover then {{goes back to the}} Jones' house to get information from Holly, but she pulls a gun on him.

50|$|Kaitangata {{is a hard}} worker, {{spending}} a lot of time fishing to feed his family. Unfortunately, he has never learned how to make hooks with a barb, and so most of his fish escape. Whaitiri gives him a barbed hook, and he catches a groper, which she offers to the gods. Whaitiri quickly tires of a diet of fish, so when her husband is away fishing, she takes a net and catches two of her husband's relatives, Tupeke-ti and Tupeke-ta. When Kaitangata returns, she asks him to perform the incantations that are used when human flesh is offered to the gods. He does not know the chants, so she tries to perform them herself, not willing to confess that she is ignorant of the correct words to use. <b>She</b> <b>mumbles</b> nonsense words, before cooking the bodies, cutting them up and gorging herself on the flesh, to the disgust of the villagers. Only the bones are left (Reed 1963:158-9).|$|R
60|$|Her father put a sofa-cushion behind her, {{but though}} <b>she</b> <b>mumbled</b> some acknowledgment, {{it was so}} surly, that Mrs. Ferrars looked up in surprise, {{and she would not}} lean back till fatigue gained the ascendancy. Mr. Kendal asking her, got little in reply but such a grunt, that Mrs. Ferrars longed to shake her, but her father fetched a footstool, and put it under her feet, and grew a little {{abstracted}} in his talk, as if watching her, and his eye had something of the old habitual melancholy.|$|E
6000|$|He was gone. And {{she was not}} {{relieved}} by the quiet of the house. She was empty {{and the house was}} empty and she needed him. She wanted to go on talking, to get this threshed out, to build a sane friendship. She wavered down to the living-room, looked out of the bay-window. He was not to be seen. But Mrs. Westlake was. She was walking past, and in the light from the corner arc-lamp she quickly inspected the porch, the windows. Carol dropped the curtain, stood with movement and reflection paralyzed. Automatically, without reasoning, <b>she</b> <b>mumbled,</b> [...] "I will see him again soon and make him understand we must be friends. But----The house is so empty. It echoes so." ...|$|E
60|$|Most of {{the wounded}} during the two days of rioting had been taken away already by their friends and relations, but several figures could be seen sitting up {{balancing}} their bandaged heads {{in time to the}} music. Charles Gould dismounted. A sleepy mozo coming out of the bakery door took hold of the horse's bridle; the practicante endeavoured to conceal his guitar hastily; the girls, unabashed, stepped back smiling; and Charles Gould, {{on his way to the}} staircase, glanced into a dark corner of the patio at another group, a mortally wounded Cargador with a woman kneeling by his side; <b>she</b> <b>mumbled</b> prayers rapidly, trying at the same time to force a piece of orange between the stiffening lips of the dying man.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I know. But it's {{quite another}} thing with baby." [...] <b>She</b> began to <b>mumble</b> {{it with her}} lips, and to talk baby-talk to it. In their common {{interest}} in this puppet they already called each other papa and mamma.|$|R
6000|$|The {{old woman}} contributed {{nothing to the}} {{definition}} of their progress. <b>She</b> stumbled and <b>mumbled</b> along, but between Seventh Avenue and Eighth she stubbornly arrested her guardians. [...] "She says"--the colored girl translated some obscure avowal across her back--"she says she wants to go home, and she lives up in Harlem." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did {{you hear}} what <b>she</b> said?" [...] <b>mumbled</b> a weak, angry voice somewhere behind Crefton's shoulder. Turning hastily, he beheld another old crone, thin and yellow and wrinkled, and evidently in a high state of displeasure. Obviously this was Martha Pillamon in person. The orchard {{seemed to be a}} {{favourite}} promenade for the aged women of the neighbourhood.|$|R
5000|$|One of Grover's friends {{called up}} on his mobile and Susairaj {{answered}} the call. <b>She</b> <b>mumbled</b> that Neeraj had [...] "gone out" [...] forgetting his cell phone with her. The friend later came {{and picked up the}} cell phone a couple of days later. This act of Susairaj also made her a prime suspect.|$|E
50|$|Rapunzel woke up {{hours before}} dawn. She heard heaving sobs {{even though she}} was not crying. She {{discovered}} a round green face staring up at her. The creature introduced himself as Steven. Steven was in debt to the witch for saving his son when he suddenly could not breathe. The witch was the only person around, and <b>she</b> <b>mumbled</b> an incantation. A large bug flew out of Steven’s son’s throat. Steven asked what he could do to repay the witch, and the witch told him she needed a cook and guard. Therefore, Steven was stuck in the tower forever. If he leaves, his son would die.|$|E
40|$|When Ross Begorrah 2 ̆ 7 s cuckoo clock {{developed}} laryngitis, {{he asked}} Mary, his shepherdess friend, to recommend an equally reliable replacement timekeeper. May was feeling drowsy from taking stock of her charges - she kept counting her pet lamb {{over and over}} again - so she did not pay Ross the full attention of her new bonnet, <b>she</b> <b>mumbled</b> a garbled reply to Ross 2 ̆ 7 s question. 2 ̆ 2 Roe, dial and red, 2 ̆ 2 was what she actually said, but it was {{on the basis of this}} that Begorrah purchased an originally dumb bird...|$|E
60|$|By {{the hearth}} sat a huddled-up figure clad, seemingly, mostly in rags: that figure was {{apparently}} a woman, although even {{that would have}} been hard to distinguish, except for the cap, which had once been white, and for what looked like the semblance of a petticoat. <b>She</b> was sitting <b>mumbling</b> to herself, {{and from time to time}} stirring the brew in her stock-pot.|$|R
60|$|Paul's {{reading was}} a great prize to Alfred, for he soon grew tired himself; his sister could not spare time to read to him, and if she did, <b>she</b> went <b>mumbling</b> on like a bee in a bottle. Her mother did much the same, and Harold used to stumble and gabble, {{so that it was}} horrible to hear him. Such reading as Paul's was a new light to them all, and was a treat to Ellen as she worked as much as to Alfred; and Paul, with hands as clean as Alfred's, was only too happy to get hold of a book, and {{infinitely}} enjoyed the constant supply kept up by Miss Selby, to make up for her not coming herself.|$|R
60|$|When Susan's {{work was}} done she'd sit, With one fat {{guttering}} candle lit, And window opened wide to win The sweet night air to enter in; There, with a thumb to keep her place She'd read, with stern and wrinkled face, Her mild eyes gliding very slow Across the letters to and fro, While wagged the guttering candle flame In the wind that through the window came. And sometimes in the silence <b>she</b> Would <b>mumble</b> a sentence audibly, Or shake {{her head as if}} to say, 'You silly souls, to act this way!' And never a sound from night I'd hear, Unless some far-off cock crowed clear; Or her old shuffling thumb should turn Another page; and rapt and stern, Through her great glasses bent on me She'd glance into reality; And shake her round old silvery head, With--'You!--I thought you was in bed!'-- Only to tilt her book again, And rooted in Romance remain.|$|R
