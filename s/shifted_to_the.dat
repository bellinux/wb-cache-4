5|$|In 1473 the Gujarat Sultan Mahmud Begada sacked {{the city}} and {{destroyed}} the temple of Dwarka. The Jagat Mandir or the Dwarakadhisa temple was later rebuilt. Vallabha Acharya retrieved an idol of Dwarkadhish, which was revered by Rukmini. He hid it in a stepwell, known as Savitri vav, during the Muslim invasion, before moving it to Ladva village. In 1551, when Turk Aziz invaded Dwarka, the idol was <b>shifted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> island of Bet Dwarka.|$|E
50|$|Because the {{denominator}} is a {{power of}} two the multiplication can be implemented as an arithmetic <b>shift</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left and the division as an arithmetic <b>shift</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right; on many processors shifts are faster than multiplication and division.|$|R

40|$|We {{quantify}} {{dynamic effect}} of shifts of exchange rate system from <b>the</b> dollar-peg <b>to</b> <b>the</b> basket- peg or floating and obtain transition paths for the shifts, {{based on a}} dynamic small open-economy model. We find that a small open country {{will be better off}} <b>shifting</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> basket-peg or floating regime than maintaining the dollar-peg regime with capital control, in the long-run. Furthermore, because of welfare costs associated with volatility in nominal interest rates, the longer the transition period, the more benefits a country gains from <b>shifting</b> suddenly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> basket-peg from the dollar- peg regime rather than proceeding gradually. Thidly, focusing on sudden <b>shifts</b> <b>to</b> desired regimes, welfare gain of the country is higher under a <b>shift</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> basket-peg if the exchagne rate fluctuates remarkably. Lastly, concerning with <b>shifting</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> managed floating, it is less attractive to adopt compared with <b>shifting</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> basket-peg as intervening <b>to</b> maintain <b>the</b> exchange rate for certain periods leads to higher losses as the authority lacks monetary policy autonomy [...] ...|$|R

5|$|The 87th Infantry Division {{arrived in}} Scotland on 22 October 1944, and trained in England {{until the end}} of November. It landed in France in early December, and moved to Metz, where, on the 8th, it went into action against and took Fort Driant. The troop {{followed}} its division as it <b>shifted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> vicinity of Gross Rederching near the Saar-German border on 10 December, and capturing Rimling, Obergailbach, and Guiderkirch.|$|E

5|$|The sperm whale's unique body is {{unlikely}} to be confused with any other species. The sperm whale's distinctive shape comes from its very large, block-shaped head, which can be one-quarter to one-third of the animal's length. The S-shaped blowhole is located very close {{to the front of the}} head and <b>shifted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> whale's left. This gives rise to a distinctive bushy, forward-angled spray.|$|E

5|$|A low {{pressure}} area developed in the northern Bay of Bengal on June 6 and developed into a depression the next day as it drifted to the north, moving over south of the Ganges Delta. The depression reversed its course overland, reemerging into the Bay of Bengal on June 8. Once over water, the depression intensified into a cyclonic storm {{on the morning of}} June 9. The cyclone's motion <b>shifted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northwest and it made a second landfall near Balasore in northern Orissa that night. The cyclone quickly weakened to a deep depression overland and tracked to the west over central India, where it degenerated into a broad area of {{low pressure}} on June 11.|$|E
5|$|A-10s were {{initially}} an unwelcome addition {{to many in}} the Air Force. Most pilots switching to the A-10 {{did not want to}} because fighter pilots traditionally favored speed and appearance. In 1987, many A-10s were <b>shifted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> forward air control (FAC) role and redesignated OA-10. In the FAC role, the OA-10 is typically equipped with up to six pods of 2.75inch (70mm) Hydra rockets, usually with smoke or white phosphorus warheads used for target marking. OA-10s are physically unchanged and remain fully combat capable despite the redesignation.|$|E
5|$|At 8:10am Captain Brown {{ordered a}} course change to 060degrees and {{informed}} {{the men that}} the conn for the battleship would remain on the eighth-level bridge until they cleared the course. This was unusual for Missouri, as the conn was usually <b>shifted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fourth-level bridge during the transit at the point when a ship passed Fort Wool and Old Point Comfort. The initial course change to 060 was altered to 058 {{as a result of}} a strong ocean current that swung Missouri too far to the right during the course correction.|$|E

50|$|Note {{the number}} of moles of gas on the {{left-hand}} side and {{the number of}} moles of gas on the right-hand side. When the volume of the system is changed, the partial pressures of the gases change. If we were to decrease pressure by increasing volume, the equilibrium of the above reaction will <b>shift</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left, because the reactant side has a greater number of moles than does the product side. <b>The</b> system tries <b>to</b> counteract <b>the</b> decrease in partial pressure of gas molecules by <b>shifting</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> side that exerts greater pressure. Similarly, if we were to increase pressure by decreasing volume, <b>the</b> equilibrium <b>shifts</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right, counteracting the pressure increase by <b>shifting</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> side with fewer moles of gas that exert less pressure. If the volume is increased because there are more moles of gas on the reactant side, this change is more significant in the denominator of the equilibrium constant expression, causing a shift in equilibrium.|$|R

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of World War I in 1914, Dr. Robert Heindl of Germany had noted that the 15,000 political prisoners at the penal colony could create an undesirable revolution and therefore their release in one stage, following capture of the island by a German ship by bombardment, was risky. He suggested that after due care and adequate security had {{been put in place}} the convicts of the penal colony could be <b>shifted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mainland in small boats.|$|E
5|$|Born in Philadelphia to {{a family}} active in Whig {{politics}}, Randall <b>shifted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Democratic Party after the Whigs' demise. His rise in politics began in the 1850s with election to the Philadelphia Common Council {{and then to the}} Pennsylvania State Senate. Randall served in a Union cavalry unit in the American Civil War before winning a seat in the federal House of Representatives in 1862. He was reelected every two years thereafter until his death. The representative of an industrial region, Randall became known as a staunch defender of protective tariffs designed to assist domestic producers of manufactured goods. While often siding with Republicans on tariff issues, he differed with them in his resistance to Reconstruction and the growth of federal power.|$|E
5|$|By late May 1942, {{responsibility}} for the defence of Fiji <b>shifted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States with a division arriving in the country. The 148th Infantry Regiment was {{to take over the}} positions of the 14th Brigade. While the 30th and 35th Battalions began packing and left the area by late June, the 37th had to wait until more American forces arrived. It was not until 5 August that the battalion boarded the American troopship President Coolidge and departed five days later. The battalion reached Auckland on 13 August and proceeded to Pukekohe where a camp had been established. After a few days, the battalion personnel went on leave for two weeks.|$|E
