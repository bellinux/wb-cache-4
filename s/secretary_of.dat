5|$|As {{provisional}} {{president in}} 1861, Davis formed his first cabinet. Robert Toombs of Georgia {{was the first}} <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> State and Christopher Memminger of South Carolina became <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> the Treasury. LeRoy Pope Walker of Alabama was made <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> War, after being recommended for this post by Clement Clay and William Yancey (both of whom declined to accept cabinet positions themselves). John Reagan of Texas became Postmaster General. Judah P. Benjamin of Louisiana became Attorney General. Although Stephen Mallory was not put forward by the delegation from his state of Florida, Davis insisted {{that he was the}} best man for the job of <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> the Navy, and he was eventually confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Between his {{election}} and his inauguration, Garfield was occupied with assembling a cabinet that would establish peace between Conkling's and Blaine's warring factions. Blaine's delegates had provided {{much of the}} support for Garfield's nomination, and the Maine senator received the place of honor: <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> State. Blaine {{was not only the}} president's closest advisor, he was obsessed with knowing all {{that took place in the}} White House, and was even said to have spies posted there in his absence. Garfield nominated William Windom of Minnesota as <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> the Treasury, William H. Hunt of Louisiana as <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> the Navy, Robert Todd Lincoln as <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> War, and Samuel J. Kirkwood of Iowa as <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> the Interior. New York was represented by Thomas Lemuel James as Postmaster General. Garfield appointed Pennsylvania's Wayne MacVeagh, an adversary of Blaine's, as Attorney General. Blaine tried to sabotage the appointment by convincing Garfield to name an opponent of MacVeagh, William E. Chandler, as Solicitor General under MacVeagh. Only Chandler's rejection by the Senate forestalled MacVeagh's resignation over the matter.|$|E

5|$|Former North Carolina Senator Elizabeth Dole is {{the first}} woman to have served in two {{different}} Cabinet positions in two different administrations. She was appointed by President Ronald Reagan as <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> Transportation in 1983, and was the <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> Labor during the tenure of George H. W. Bush—Reagan's successor. Czechoslovakia-born Madeleine Albright became the first foreign-born woman to serve in the Cabinet when she was appointed <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> State in 1997. Her appointment also made her the highest-ranking female Cabinet member at that time. Condoleezza Rice was appointed <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> State in 2005, and thus became the highest-ranking woman in the United States presidential line of succession in history. In 2006, Nancy Pelosi replaced Rice as the highest-ranking woman in line when she was elected Speaker of the House.|$|E

5|$|The curial {{office of}} Cardinal <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> State {{in many ways}} evolved from the roles {{formerly}} filled by cardinal-nephews.

5|$|With Clayton's aid, Taylor {{chose the}} six {{remaining}} {{members of his}} cabinet.

For the position of Postmaster General, which {{also served as a}} center of patronage, Taylor chose Congressman Jacob Collamer of Vermont. After Horace Binney refused appointment as <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> the Treasury, Taylor chose another prominent Philadelphian in William M. Meredith. George W. Crawford a former Governor of Georgia, accepted the position of <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> War, while Congressman William B. Preston of Virginia became <b>Secretary</b> <b>of</b> the Navy.
