5|$|Martin McGuinness, deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland was {{selected}} by <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin,</b> and received enough support from independent TDs to be nominated.|$|E
5|$|Research by the Glasgow Media Group {{indicates}} that coverage of <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> by the BBC before the ban was minimal. In 1988 <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> was only heard or {{seen on television}} 93 times, had only 17 of the 633 formal BBC interviews as compared to 121 interviews with the Conservative Party and 172 with the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the civil service, and were never interviewed in the studio like many other participants. However, after the ban there was a steep decline in coverage of <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> and Republican views, with television appearances being reduced to 34 times in the following year, and the delays and uncertainties caused by ambiguities, voice-overs and subtitles often led to coverage and films being dropped entirely.|$|E
5|$|As of November 2013, {{all parties}} in the Dáil support {{same-sex}} marriage: the Labour Party, the Green Party, the Socialist Party, <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin,</b> Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.|$|E
5|$|From October 1988 to September 1994 {{the voices}} of representatives from <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> and several Irish republican and loyalist groups were banned by the British {{government}} from being broadcast on television and radio in the United Kingdom. The restrictions, announced by the Home Secretary, Douglas Hurd, on 19 October 1988, covered eleven organisations based in Northern Ireland and followed a heightened period {{of violence in the}} history of the Troubles, as well as the government's belief in a need to prevent <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> from using the media for political advantage.|$|E
5|$|In 1982 <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> {{won five}} {{seats in the}} {{elections}} to the Northern Ireland Assembly, and in 1983 Gerry Adams won {{a seat in the}} UK general election. As a result of the political base built during the hunger strike, <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> continued to grow in the following two decades. After the United Kingdom general election, 2001, it became the largest nationalist party in Northern Ireland and after the 2014 local and European elections held {{on both sides of the}} border, asserted it was now the largest party in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|On 10 June 1996, multi-party {{negotiations}} {{began in}} Belfast. <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> {{had been elected}} to take part but were barred because the IRA had not resumed its ceasefire or agreed to disarm.|$|E
5|$|In Northern Ireland, unionists took {{exception}} to the appearance of McGuinness election posters there given that Northern Ireland citizens were not eligible to vote in this Republic of Ireland election. <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> has regularly called for voting rights {{in the presidential election}} to be extended to Irish citizens in Northern Ireland.|$|E
5|$|The Conservative {{government}} {{believed there}} was a need for it to act to prevent <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> from using the media to defend the actions of the IRA, and the measures were part of a wider government response to the increase in violence, which also included changes to the right to silence and the tightening of rules allowing paramilitary prisoners early release. Further controversy also erupted in September 1988 over an intended edition of the Channel 4 discussion programme After Dark which was to have featured the <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> president, Gerry Adams, as a guest. The show was dropped after the conservative academic Paul Wilkinson – a Professor at Aberdeen University who specialised in the study of terrorism and political violence – voiced strong objections to its transmission (more details here).|$|E
5|$|Descended from Irish {{nationalist}} grandparents on both sides, Neal {{has been}} an advocate for Irish concerns throughout his Congressional career, pushing to keep the United States involved in the Northern Ireland peace process. He is the co-chair of the ad hoc Committee on Irish Affairs, has been chairman of the Friends of Ireland since 2007, and was considered {{as a candidate for}} United States Ambassador to Ireland in 1998. After the disarmament of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) in September 2005, Neal was among a group of Congressmen who met with <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> MP Martin McGuinness to congratulate him on the action of disarmament and ensure a lasting peace had been reached. Neal invited <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> President Gerry Adams to the inauguration of Barack Obama in January 2009. Neal has been named {{as one of the top}} 100 Irish-Americans by Irish America magazine and received the International Leadership Award from The American Ireland Fund in 2002.|$|E
5|$|The pro-independence republican party, <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin,</b> {{received}} overwhelming endorsement in {{the general}} election of 1918, and in 1919 proclaimed an Irish Republic, setting up its own parliament (Dáil Éireann) and government. Simultaneously the Volunteers, which became known as the Irish Republican Army (IRA), launched a three-year guerrilla war, which ended in a truce in July 1921 (although violence continued until June 1922, mostly in Northern Ireland).|$|E
5|$|Martin McGuinness of <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> and Ian Pearson of the Northern Ireland Office {{were at the}} match, as {{were eight}} family members of victims of the Omagh bombing, who sat in the Hogan Stand as guests of the GAA. Donegal singer Mickey Joe Harte sang Ireland's {{national}} anthem, Amhrán na bhFiann, before the match. In the All-Ireland Minor Football Championship Final, held just before the senior game, Laois and Dublin drew, each side scoring 111 (14 points).|$|E
5|$|The UK ban {{was lifted}} on 16 September 1994, a {{fortnight}} {{after the first}} IRA ceasefire was declared. On the same day Major announced that ten roads linking Northern Ireland with the Republic (which had been closed by British security forces) would reopen, and promised any negotiated deal {{on the future of}} Northern Ireland's governance would be subject to a referendum. The deputy leader of <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin,</b> Martin McGuinness, gave his first direct interview to Ulster Television shortly after the restrictions ceased.|$|E
5|$|The second {{hunger strike}} {{took place in}} 1981 and was a {{showdown}} between the prisoners and the British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher. One hunger striker, Bobby Sands, was elected as a Member of Parliament during the strike, prompting media interest from around the world. The strike was called off after ten prisoners had starved themselves to death—including Sands, whose funeral was attended by an estimated 100,000people. The strike radicalised Irish nationalist politics, and was the driving force that enabled <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> to become a mainstream political party.|$|E
5|$|Feminists in Ireland in {{the early}} 20th century {{included}} the revolutionary Irish Republican, suffragette and socialist Constance Markievicz who in 1918 {{was the first woman}} elected to the British House of Commons. However, in line with <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> abstentionist policy, she would not take her seat in the House of Commons. She was re-elected to the Second Dáil in the elections of 1921. She was also a commander of the Irish Citizens Army which was led by the socialist & self-described feminist, Irish leader James Connolly during the 1916 Easter Rising.|$|E
5|$|Initially, this protest did not {{attract a}} great deal of attention, and even the IRA {{regarded}} it as a side-issue compared to their armed campaign. It began to attract attention when Tomás Ó Fiaich, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh, visited the prison and condemned the conditions there. In 1979, former MP Bernadette McAliskey stood in the election for the European Parliament on a platform of support for the protesting prisoners, and won 5.9% of the vote across Northern Ireland, even though <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> had called for a boycott of the election.|$|E
5|$|On 16 September it was {{revealed}} that the party would seek to have Martin McGuinness, deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, nominated to contest the election. With 14 TDs and three Senators, <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> were three short of the required twenty Oireachtas members to nominate a candidate for the presidency. Soon after the nomination was announced, four Independent TDs agreed to nominate McGuinness, securing his nomination: Michael Healy-Rae and Tom Fleming (both representing Kerry South), Luke 'Ming' Flanagan (Roscommon–South Leitrim) and Finian McGrath (Dublin North-Central). Both 'Ming' Flanagan and McGrath had previously pledged their support to Norris.|$|E
5|$|The party {{also became}} {{very active in}} {{establishing}} contacts with post-communist parties in Eastern European countries, including the Croatian Party of Rights, Slovak National Party and IMRO – Bulgarian National Movement. While not keeping official contacts, it was in addition very supportive of left-wing nationalist parties such as the Scottish National Party, Irish <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> and Basque Herri Batasuna. Some of the parties it established contacts with most recently was the Freedom Party of Austria and the Italian Lega Nord, which {{after a period of}} distrust, maintained contacts since 2002.|$|E
5|$|Despite strong {{warnings}} {{that it was}} a bad idea, the War Cabinet decided to impose conscription on Ireland in 1918. The main reason was that labour in Britain demanded it as the price for cutting back on exemptions for certain workers. Labour wanted the principle established that no one was exempt, but it did not demand that conscription should actually take place in Ireland. The proposal was enacted, but never enforced. The Roman Catholic bishops for the first time entered the fray, calling for open resistance to compulsory military service, while the majority of Irish nationalists moved to supporting the intransigent <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> movement (away from the constitutional Irish National Party). This proved a decisive moment, marking the end of Irish willingness to stay inside the Union.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the general}} {{election}} in February 2011, and {{the election of the}} members of the 24th Seanad, only three political parties had the minimum 20 members of Oireachtas to nominate a candidate: Fine Gael (76 TDs and 19 senators), the Labour Party (37 TDs and 13 senators) and Fianna Fáil (19 TDs and 14 senators). <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin,</b> the next largest party in the Dáil Éireann, have 14 TDs and 3 senators. For other candidates to be nominated, support from members of smaller parties, independents (of which there are currently 14 TDs and 11 senators) or excess members of the three larger parties was needed, or the support of four local authorities.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, {{the frustrations}} caused by delays to Irish home rule led the MPs of <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin,</b> a pro-independence party that {{had won a}} {{majority}} of the Irish seats in the 1918 British general election, to establish an independent parliament in Dublin, at which Irish independence was declared. The Irish Republican Army simultaneously began a guerrilla war against the British administration. The Anglo-Irish War ended in 1921 with a stalemate and the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, creating the Irish Free State, a Dominion within the British Empire, with effective internal independence but still constitutionally linked with the British Crown. Northern Ireland, consisting of six of the 32 Irish counties which had been established as a devolved region under the 1920 Government of Ireland Act, immediately exercised its option under the treaty to retain its existing status within the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Nine protesting prisoners contested {{the general}} {{election}} in the Republic of Ireland in June. Kieran Doherty and Paddy Agnew (who was not on hunger strike) were elected in Cavan–Monaghan and Louth respectively, and Joe McDonnell narrowly missed election in Sligo–Leitrim. There were also local elections in Northern Ireland around that time and, although <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> did not contest them, some smaller groups and independents who supported the hunger strikers gained seats, such as the Irish Independence Party with 21 seats, while the Irish Republican Socialist Party (the INLA's political wing) and People's Democracy (a Trotskyist group) gained two seats each, {{and a number of}} pro-hunger strike independent candidates also won seats. The British government rushed through the Representation of the People Act 1981 to prevent another prisoner contesting the second by-election in Fermanagh and South Tyrone, which was due to take place following the death of Sands.|$|E
5|$|The Downing Street Declaration of 1993 allowed <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin,</b> a {{political}} party associated with the IRA, to participate in all-party peace negotiations on condition that the IRA called a ceasefire. The IRA called a ceasefire on 31 August 1994. John Major's government, dependent on Ulster Unionist Party votes, then began insisting that the IRA must fully disarm before there could be any all-party negotiations. The IRA saw this as a demand for total surrender and believed the British were unwilling to hold negotiations. It ended its ceasefire on 9 February 1996 when it detonated a powerful truck bomb in Canary Wharf, {{one of the two}} financial districts of London. The blast killed two people and caused an estimated £150 million worth of damage. The IRA then planted five other devices in London within the space of 10weeks.|$|E
5|$|The seven {{candidates}} were Mary Davis, Seán Gallagher, Michael D. Higgins, Martin McGuinness, Gay Mitchell, David Norris and Dana Rosemary Scallon. Davis, Gallagher, Norris and Scallon (all running as Independents), secured their nominations via local authorities. Higgins was {{put forward by}} Labour, McGuinness was put forward by <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> and Mitchell was put forward by Fine Gael. The previously dominant Fianna Fáil party declined to put forward an official candidate following their disastrous general election campaign earlier that year. Norris, a civil rights campaigner credited with helping overthrow Ireland's laws criminalising homosexuality, was the leading candidate {{for much of the}} race, and had more than double the support of the other declared candidates in January 2011. He withdrew in August 2011 but returned to the race the following month due to his continuing widespread popular appeal.|$|E
5|$|In 1994 Tony Hall, {{the head}} of the BBC's News and Current Affairs, argued that the {{restrictions}} did not allow viewers to make a proper judgment about those subject to the rules, as the subtle changes to their voices could not be heard. In particular he cited the example of the appearance of Gerry Adams on the BBC's On the Record in September 1993, in which he spoke about the prospect of peace in Northern Ireland. Hall said Adams was nervous and defensive throughout the interview as the presenter, Sheena McDonald, argued that peace could not be achieved while the IRA continued its violent stance, but that viewers were unaware of these aspects of the discussion. He also said that some countries, such as India and Egypt, had quoted the restrictions to BBC journalists who complained about the over use of censorship by authorities in those countries. Additionally Hall argued that <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> and the IRA had manipulated the ban by using it as an excuse to decline interviews.|$|E
5|$|Tsakalotos {{went on to}} read Philosophy, Politics and Economics at The Queen's College, Oxford. Whilst at the Queen's College, Tsakalotos was {{an admirer}} of both Gerald Cohen and Andrew Glyn, a Marxist {{political}} philosopher and Marxian economist respectively, who both taught at the university. He also took part in student protests against Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government. During his time at university, he became a supporter of Irish republicanism, a view he expressed in {{his visit to the}} <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> ardfheis in March 2015. One of his university friends at this time, Yannis Stournaras, later became a Greek finance minister and served as Governor of the Bank of Greece. Following graduation, he completed a master's degree (MPhil) at the Institute of Development Studies, attached to the University of Sussex. He then returned to Oxford to complete a doctorate (DPhil) in economics, studying at Mansfield College. He completed this doctorate in 1989 under the supervision of Włodzimierz Brus, with his thesis, , later being published as a book.|$|E
5|$|Livingstone {{agreed to}} meet Gerry Adams, <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> President and IRA-supporter, after Adams was invited to London by Labour members of the Troops Out {{campaign}} in December 1982. The same day as the invitation was made, the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) bombed The Droppin Well bar in Ballykelly, County Londonderry, killing 11 soldiers and 6 civilians; in the aftermath, Livingstone was pressured to cancel the meeting. Expressing his horror at the bombing, Livingstone insisted that the meeting proceed, for Adams had no connection with the INLA, but Conservative Home Secretary Willie Whitelaw banned Adams' entry to Britain with the 1976 Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act. In February 1983, Livingstone visited Adams in his constituency of West Belfast, receiving a hero's welcome from local republicans. In July 1983, Adams finally came to London on the invite of Livingstone and MP Jeremy Corbyn, allowing him to present his views to a mainstream British audience through televised interviews. In August, Livingstone was interviewed on Irish state radio, proclaiming that Britain's 800-year occupation of Ireland was more destructive than the Holocaust; he was publicly criticised by Labour members and the press. He also controversially expressed solidarity with the Marxist–Leninist government of Fidel Castro in Cuba against the U.S. economic embargo, in turn receiving an annual Christmas gift of Cuban rum from the Cuban embassy.|$|E
5|$|The IRA {{notified}} the McCann, Savage, and Farrell {{families of the}} deaths {{on the evening of}} 6 March. In Belfast, Joe Austin, a senior local member of <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin,</b> was assigned the task of recovering the bodies for burial. On 9 March, he and Terence Farrell (one of Mairéad Farrell's brothers) travelled to Gibraltar to identify the bodies. Austin negotiated a charter aircraft to collect the corpses from Gibraltar and fly them to Dublin on 14 March. In 2017 it emerged that Charles Haughey had secretly requested that the Royal Air Force fly the bodies direct to Belfast, bypassing the Republic of which he was Taoiseach. Two thousand people waited to meet the coffins in Dublin, which were then driven north to Belfast. Northern Irish authorities flooded the neighbourhoods where McCann, Farrell and Savage had lived with soldiers and police to try to prevent public displays of sympathy for the dead. Later that evening, a local IRA member, Kevin McCracken, was shot and allegedly then beaten to death by a group of soldiers he had been attempting to shoot at. At the border, the authorities met the procession with a large number of police and military vehicles, and insisted on intervals between the hearses, causing tensions between the police {{and the members of the}} procession and leading to accusations that the police rammed Savage's hearse.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} to mid-1970s, Official <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> was {{sometimes}} called <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> (Gardiner Place) to distinguish it from the rival offshoot Provisional <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin,</b> or <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> (Kevin Street). Gardiner Place had symbolic power as the headquarters of <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> for decades before the 1970 split. This sobriquet died out in the mid-1970s.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of this non-recognition, <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> had abstained from taking any of the seats they won in the British or Irish parliaments. At its 1986 Ard Fheis, <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> delegates passed a {{resolution}} to amend the rules and constitution that would allow its members to sit in the Dublin parliament (Leinster House). At this, Ruairí Ó Brádaigh led a small walkout, just as he and Sean Mac Stiofain had done sixteen years earlier with the creation of Provisional <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin.</b> This minority, which rejected dropping the policy of abstentionism, now distinguishes itself from Provisional <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> by using the name Republican <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> (or <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> Poblachtach), and maintains that they are the true <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> {{received}} 46.9% {{of votes}} island-wide, and 65% of {{votes in the}} area that became the Irish Free State. However, the 46.9% is not the total result of the overall success of <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin.</b> That figure only accounts for 48 seats that they won because in 25 of the other constituencies the other parties did not contest them, and <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> won them unopposed. Most of these constituencies were <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> strongholds. It is estimated that, had the 25 seats been contested, <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> would have received at least 53% of the vote island-wide. However, this is a conservative estimate and the percentage would likely have been higher. <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> also did not contest four seats due to a deal with the IPP (see below). Labour, who had pulled out in the south under instructions to 'wait', polled better in Belfast than <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tentative {{negotiations}} between <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> and the British government {{led to more}} substantive discussions with the SDLP in the 1990s. Multi-party negotiations began in 1994 in Northern Ireland, without <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin.</b> The Provisional IRA declared a ceasefire {{in the autumn of}} 1994. <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> then joined the talks, but the Conservative government under John Major soon came to depend on unionist votes to remain in power. It suspended <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> from the talks, and began to insist that the IRA decommission all of their weapons before <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> be re-admitted to the talks; this led to the IRA calling off its ceasefire. The new Labour government of Tony Blair wasn't reliant on unionist votes and re-admitted <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin,</b> leading to another, permanent, ceasefire.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> is {{organised}} throughout Ireland, {{and membership}} {{is open to}} all Irish residents over the age of 16. The party is organised hierarchically into cumainn (branches), comhairle ceantair (district executives), and cúigí (regional executives). At national level, the Coiste Seasta (Standing Committee) oversees the day-to-day running of <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin.</b> It is an eight-member body nominated by the <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> Ard Chomhairle (National Executive) and also includes the chairperson of each cúige. The <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> Ard Chomhairle meets at least once a month. It directs the overall implementation of <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> policy and activities of the party.|$|E
25|$|Adams {{remains the}} President of <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin.</b> In 2011 he succeeded Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin as <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> {{parliamentary}} leader in Dáil Éireann.|$|E
25|$|The Official IRA {{was linked}} to the {{political}} party Official <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin,</b> later renamed <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> the Workers Party and then the Workers' Party of Ireland.|$|E
25|$|A meeting {{called by}} Count Plunkett on 19 April 1917 {{led to the}} {{formation}} of a broad political movement under the banner of <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> which was formalised at the <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> Ard Fheis of 25 October 1917. The Conscription Crisis of 1918 further intensified public support for <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> before the general elections to the British Parliament on 14 December 1918, which resulted in a landslide victory for <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin,</b> winning 73 seats out of 105, whose MPs gathered in Dublin on 21 January 1919 to form Dáil Éireann and adopt the Declaration of Independence.|$|E
25|$|The 1989 local {{government}} elections saw {{a drop in}} support for <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin.</b> Defending 58 seats (the 59 won in 1985, plus two 1987 by-election gains in West Belfast, minus three councillors who had defected to Republican <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> in 1986), the party lost 15 seats. In {{the aftermath of the}} election, Mitchell McLaughlin admitted that recent IRA activity had affected the <b>Sinn</b> <b>Féin</b> vote.|$|E
