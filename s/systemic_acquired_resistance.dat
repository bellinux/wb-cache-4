5|$|Unlike animals, plants lack {{phagocytic}} cells, {{but many}} plant immune responses involve systemic chemical signals that are sent through a plant. Individual plant cells respond to molecules associated with pathogens known as Pathogen-associated molecular patterns or PAMPs. When {{a part of}} a plant becomes infected, the plant produces a localized hypersensitive response, whereby cells at the site of infection undergo rapid apoptosis {{to prevent the spread of}} the disease to other parts of the plant. <b>Systemic</b> <b>acquired</b> <b>resistance</b> (SAR) is a type of defensive response used by plants that renders the entire plant resistant to a particular infectious agent. RNA silencing mechanisms are particularly important in this systemic response as they can block virus replication.|$|E

40|$|Genetic {{engineering}} is a promising strategy for creating agriculturally significant resistance in carrot. Several different transgenic strategies, {{in addition to}} conducting a detailed quantification of commonly used promoters to achieve disease resistance were investigated. Tissue-specific patterns and levels of protein expression were characterized in transgenic carrot plants transformed with the ?-glucuronidase gene driven by five promoters: Cauliflower moasaic virus 35 S, double 35 S (D 35 S), Arabidopsis ubiquitin (UBQ 3), mannopine synthase (mas 2) or rooting loci promoter (rolD). UBQ 3 promoter provided {{the highest levels of}} expression in roots, while D 35 S and 35 S promoters had high expression in leaves. rolD and Mas 2 promoters had enhanced root expression; however levels were much lower compared to the constitutive promoters, which were subsequently used in this research. Genes encoding a rice peroxidase (POC 1), wheat chitinase (383) and ? 1, 3 - glucanase (638) were introduced into carrot. Lines expressing 638 alone had no enhanced resistance to B. cinerea or S. scleorotiorum, while 383 lines reduced disease symptoms by up to 40 %. When 638 and 383 were co-expressed resistance levels were similar to 383 alone. High levels of disease resistance were seen in lines expressing POC 1 with 70 - 90 % reduction in symptoms to B. cinerea and S. sclerotiorum. POC 1 lines had 20 - 30 % increases in lignin levels in petioles and roots, which was enhanced with pathogen challenge. Several defence genes exhibited strong induction in POC 1 expressing plants when induced with fungal cell wall elicitor. Additionally, POC 1 lines had reduced H 2 O 2 accumulation during oxidative burst response. POC 1 derived resistance was effective towards necrotrophic pathogens. Over-expression of Arabidopsis Nonexpressor of Pathogenesis Related protein 1 was studied in carrot, with two independent lines successfully generated and analyzed. There was no detectable activation of the <b>systemic</b> <b>acquire</b> <b>resistance</b> (SAR) pathways in the absence of pathogens, however, the lines exhibited more intense and longer lasting activation of SAR when elicited with fungal cell walls or Salicylic acid. Both lines were highly resistant against biotrophic and necrotrophic foliar pathogens and the roots were resistant towards A. radicina, indicating broad-spectrum disease resistance. The results from this study demonstrate the feasibility of engineering disease resistance in carrot using several different approaches...|$|R
5|$|Within {{minutes of}} systemin perception, the cytosolic Ca2+ {{concentration}} increases, and linolenic acid is released from cell membranes after a phospholipase has been activated. Linolenic acid is then converted to jasmonic acid via the octadecanoid pathway and jasmonic acid activates defensive genes. Production of methyl jasmonate is induced by systemins and also upregulates systemin precursor genes creating a feedback loop, amplifying the defensive signal. Methyl jasmonate is volatile and can therefore activate <b>systemic</b> <b>acquired</b> <b>resistance</b> in neighbouring plants, preparing their defences for attack. These signalling events are {{analogous to the}} cytokine-mediated inflammatory immune response in animals. When the inflammatory response is activated in animals, MAPKs are activated which in turn activate phospholipases. Lipids in the membrane are converted to arachidonic acid and then to prostaglandins, which are analogs of jasmonic acid. Both pathways can be inhibited by suramin.|$|E
5|$|Systemin is a plant {{peptide hormone}} {{involved}} in the wound response in the Solanaceae family. It was the first plant hormone that was {{proven to be a}} peptide having been isolated from tomato leaves in 1991 by a group led by Clarence A. Ryan. Since then other peptides, with similar functions have been identified in tomato and outside of the Solanaceae. Hydroxyproline-rich glycopeptides were found in tobacco in 2001 and AtPEPs (Arabidopsis thaliana Plant Elicitor Peptides) were found in Arabidopsis thaliana in 2006. Their precursors are found both in the cytoplasm and cell walls of plant cells, upon insect damage, the precursors are processed to produce one or more mature peptides. The receptor for systemin was first thought to be the same as the brassinolide receptor but this is now uncertain. The signal transduction processes that occur after the peptides bind are similar to the cytokine-mediated inflammatory immune response in animals. Early experiments showed that systemin travelled around the plant after insects had damaged the plant, activating <b>systemic</b> <b>acquired</b> <b>resistance,</b> now it is thought that it increases the production of jasmonic acid causing the same result. The main function of systemins is to coordinate defensive responses against insect herbivores but they also affect plant development. Systemin induces the production of protease inhibitors which protect against insect herbivores, other peptides activate defensins and modify root growth. They have also been shown to affect plants' responses to salt stress and UV radiation. AtPEPs have been shown to affect resistance against oomycetes and may allow A. thaliana to distinguish between different pathogens. In Nicotiana attenuata, some of the peptides have stopped being involved in defensive roles and instead affect flower morphology.|$|E

We conducted a greenhouse experiment to examine synergistic impact of plant growth promoting rhizobacterium, Bacillus subtilis (BERA 71), and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) (Claroideoglomus etunicatum; Rhizophagus intraradices; and Funneliformis mosseae) to induce <b>acquired</b> <b>systemic</b> <b>resistance</b> in Talh tree (Acacia gerrardii Benth.) against adverse impact of salt stress. Compared to the control, the BERA 71 treatment significantly enhanced root colonization intensity by AMF, in both presence and absence of salt. We also found positive synergistic interaction between B. subtilis and AMF vis-a-vis improvement in the nutritional value in terms of increase in total lipids, phenols, and fiber content. The AMF and BERA 71 inoculated plants showed increased content of osmoprotectants such as glycine, betaine, and proline, though lipid peroxidation was reduced probably as a mechanism of salt tolerance. Furthermore, the application of bioinoculants to Talh tree {{turned out to be}} potentially beneficial in ameliorating the deleterious impact of salinity on plant metabolism, probably by modulating the osmoregulatory system (glycine betaine, proline, and phenols) and antioxidant enzymes system (SOD, CAT, POD, GR, APX, DHAR, MDAHR, and GSNOR) ...|$|R

Inter- and intraspecific diversities of Scedosporium species were analyzed for three partitions (rDNA internal transcribed spacer gene [ITS], partial beta-tubulin gene, and amplified fragment length polymorphism profiles), with the aim to establish distribution of resistance between species, populations, and strains. Heterogeneity of and recombination between lineages were determined, and distances between clusters were calculated using a centroid approach. Clinical, geographic, and antifungal data were plotted on diversity networks. Scedosporium minutisporum, Scedosporium desertorum, and Scedosporium aurantiacum were distinguished unambiguously in all partitions and had differential antifungal susceptibility profiles (ASP). Pseudallescheria fusoidea and Pseudallescheria ellipsoidea were indistinguishable from Scedosporium boydii. Pseudallescheria angusta took an intermediate position between Scedosporium apiospermum and S. boydii. Scedosporium boydii and S. apiospermum had identical ASP. Differences in (multi) resistance were linked to individual strains. S. apiospermum and S. boydii showed limited interbreeding and were recognized as valid, sympatric species. The S. apiospermum/S. boydii group, comprising the main clinically relevant Scedosporium species, consists of separate lineages and is interpreted as a complex undergoing sympatric evolution with incomplete lineage sorting. In routine diagnostics, the lineages in S. apiospermum/S. boydii are indicated with the umbrella descriptor "S. apiospermum complex"; individual species can be identified with rDNA ITS with 96. 3 % confidence.
