5|$|After his tour, Dylan {{returned}} to New York, but the pressures increased. ABC Television had paid an advance for a TV <b>show.</b> <b>His</b> publisher, Macmillan, was demanding a manuscript of the poem/novel Tarantula.

5|$|Although largely {{faithful}} to {{a selection of}} historical facts, the film has drawn criticism for embellishing on events {{in order to increase}} dramatic potential. For example, Prince Albert was never shot during an assassination attempt on Queen Victoria. Fellowes told BBC Radio 4's Film Programme that in actuality the prince did put his body before the queen as protection, and that showing Prince Albert having been grazed by the bullet in the film was added to best <b>show</b> <b>his</b> bravery and devotion as he tried to stop Queen Victoria from being shot.|$|E
5|$|An {{injury to}} Bolt's {{hamstring}} in March 2014 {{caused him to}} miss nine weeks of training. Having recovered from surgery, Bolt competed in the 4 × 100 metres relay of the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. Not in peak form Bolt {{said that he was}} attending the Games for the fans and to <b>show</b> <b>his</b> progress since the injury. Bolt and his teammates won the 4 × 100 metres relay in 37.58 seconds – a Commonwealth Games record. This was the foremost competition of the year for Bolt, given no Olympics or World Championships in 2014.|$|E

On working with Big K.R.I.T., Lecrae stated to Billboard that K.R.I.T. had already {{reached out to}} him before the collaboration to <b>show</b> <b>his</b> appreciation for Lecrae's honesty. In an interview with AllHipHop, Lecrae mentioned that both he and Big K.R.I.T. have similar backgrounds, having both {{grown up in the}} Southern United States and struggled with religion under the influence of a religious grandmother.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{was sworn}} in on December 31, 2005 at the Buffalo Convention Center. During his first day in office he toured the Buffalo Waterfront to <b>show</b> <b>his</b> {{commitment}} to its development. Before {{the end of the}} year, restoration on the original point where the Erie Canal met the Great Lakes was underway. Brown presented his plans for the development during subsequent tours by top state leaders, including future New York State Governors Eliot Spitzer and David Paterson. Erie Canal Harbor eventually opened on July 2, 2008.|$|E
5|$|In {{gratitude}} {{for protecting the}} Christians in Nazareth and Acre, Napoleon III of France presented Aqil a gun and the Legion of Honor medal in April 1861 aboard his French vessel docked at Haifa Bay. Edward, Prince of Wales (later King of the United Kingdom) personally visited Aqil two years later to <b>show</b> <b>his</b> appreciation. Aqil offered Edward four Arabian horses, but Edward politely declined. As a token of his appreciation, Edward gave Aqil a revolver.|$|E

The abundance of coin treasure troves found in the territory of the Tsardom of Vidin is an indication of the wealth and the well developed trade in the region {{during the second half of}} the 14th century. The Brașov Charter, the only surviving document made by Ivan Sratsimir, grants the merchants of the Transylvanian town of Brașov free access and the right to trade in his realm.|$|E
5|$|Jones {{was born}} in Point Fortin, Trinidad and Tobago, to Lydia and Pamphile. and he {{attended}} St. Anthony's College in Trinidad along with his future Sunderland team-mate Carlos Edwards. His uncle, Philibert Jones was also a footballer as a prolific forward for Strike Squad that came within a point of qualifying for the 1990 World Cup and was a similar player to Kenwyne; both in style and celebration. His athleticism and pace, which Sunderland considered attractive, was not established until he joined Sheffield Wednesday in September and began to <b>show</b> <b>his</b> potential.|$|E
5|$|Kakashi was {{originally}} created by Kishimoto to be a harsh teacher but the author decided to avoid that. Instead, he {{made him more}} generous to calm his students in difficult situations {{to the point of}} giving him feminine traits. Kakashi's design gave Kishimoto difficulties as a result of having most of his face covered and as a result it was difficult to <b>show</b> <b>his</b> emotions. For the anime series, he is voiced by Kazuhiko Inoue in Japanese and Dave Wittenberg in the English dub.|$|E

5|$|Mating {{has rarely}} been {{observed}} in sharks. The smaller catsharks often mate with the male curling around the female. In less flexible species the two sharks swim {{parallel to each other}} while the male inserts a clasper into the female's oviduct. Females in many of the larger species have bite marks that appear to be a result of a male grasping them to maintain position during mating. The bite marks may also come from courtship behavior: the male may bite the female to <b>show</b> <b>his</b> interest. In some species, females have evolved thicker skin to withstand these bites.|$|E

5|$|On 22 July, {{a council}} {{was held in}} the Church of the Holy Sepulchre to {{establish}} a king for the newly created Kingdom of Jerusalem. Raymond of Toulouse at first refused to become king, perhaps attempting to <b>show</b> <b>his</b> piety, but probably hoping that the other nobles would insist upon his election anyway. Godfrey, who had become the more popular of the two after Raymond's actions at the siege of Antioch, did no damage to his own piety by accepting a position as secular leader. Raymond was incensed at this development and took his army out into the countryside.|$|E

Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) and Michael Scott (Steve Carell) fire Roy, and Jim, feeling guilty about all of his pranks over the years, tries to <b>show</b> <b>his</b> {{appreciation}} to Dwight for saving him, but each gesture is coolly rejected, as Dwight believes he only acted {{in the line of}} duty and is undeserving of any special praise.|$|E
5|$|There {{was some}} {{specific}} work {{required by the}} make-up department on Brent Spiner as during those flashbacks he was made to look younger which the team created by dying his hair darker and applying more youthful make-up. Also, the team added several different appliances to Kris Iyer to <b>show</b> <b>his</b> character go {{through a series of}} levels of infection of a number of diseases at the hands of Soong. These included colored contact lenses, prosthetics to make his veins appear to pulse and gel was added to his eyes to make them bloodshot.|$|E

5|$|To {{promote the}} album, Arjona {{embarked}} on the Metamorfosis World Tour. The <b>show,</b> <b>his</b> first since 2009's Quinto Piso Tour, comprised five legs across North and Latin America.

5|$|To <b>show</b> <b>his</b> {{commitment}} to reform, Hayes appointed {{one of the}} best-known advocates of reform, Carl Schurz, to be Secretary of the Interior and asked Schurz and William M. Evarts, his Secretary of State, to lead a special cabinet committee charged with drawing up new rules for federal appointments. John Sherman, the Treasury Secretary, ordered John Jay to investigate the New York Custom House, which was stacked with Conkling's spoilsmen. Jay's report suggested that the New York Custom House was so overstaffed with political appointees that 20% of the employees were expendable.|$|E
5|$|Two {{artists that}} changed the comics {{industry}} dramatically in the late 1960s were Neal Adams, considered one of his country's greatest draftsmen, and Jim Steranko. Both artists expressed a cinematic approach at times that occasionally altered the more conventional panel-based format that had been commonplace for decades. Adams' breakthrough was based on layout and rendering. Best known for returning Batman to his somber roots after the campy success of the Batman television <b>show,</b> <b>his</b> naturalistic depictions of anatomy, faces, and gestures changed comics' style {{in a way that}} Strausbaugh sees reflected in modern graphic novels.|$|E
