60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sighed</b> <b>and</b> walked dizzily beside him. They {{went on in}} silence.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sighed,</b> <b>and</b> {{passed out}} of the door which he had thrown open.|$|E
5000|$|When Ian asks to use Barbara's {{cardigan}} in Episode 2, <b>she</b> <b>sighs</b> <b>and</b> says, [...] "Not again." [...] The companions had unravelled {{another of}} her cardigans in The Space Museum.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sighed</b> bitterly, <b>and</b> {{turned again}} toward the red-brick house.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>she</b> <b>sighed</b> deeply <b>and</b> {{changed the}} subject of conversation.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sighed,</b> <b>and</b> {{looked down}} at the {{handkerchief}} with which she had been toying.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sighed,</b> <b>and</b> {{looked up}} at him through a little cloud of tobacco smoke.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sighed,</b> <b>and</b> he saw {{something}} in her eyes which haunted him for long afterwards.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sighed</b> deeply, <b>and</b> {{her look}} of weariness was painful to see.|$|R
60|$|Sybil hesitated. Her {{thoughts}} for {{a moment}} were in confusion. Then <b>she</b> <b>sighed</b> once <b>and</b> turned towards the wood.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sighed</b> faintly <b>and</b> half-closed her eyes. For {{the moment}} she had {{forgotten}} everything. She was absolutely and completely happy.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sighed</b> <b>and</b> {{wiped her}} eyes. Still Tavernake said nothing. She looked at him, a little surprised.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sighed,</b> <b>and</b> her face, {{which was}} once more within the light, showed a look of sad inquiry.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sighed,</b> <b>and</b> {{watched the}} top of the lift as it came up. Then she dropped her veil.|$|E
60|$|And {{she will}} be a happy woman, thought poor Rose. But <b>she</b> only <b>sighed</b> <b>and</b> dropped the conversation.|$|R
60|$|At Brutus's {{description}} of the scene there had been 'twixt Robespierre <b>and</b> Caron <b>she</b> <b>sighed</b> heavily, <b>and</b> her lashes grew wet.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>sighed,</b> <b>she</b> smiled, <b>and</b> to {{the flowers}} [...] Pointing, the lovely moralist said; [...] See, friend, in some few leisure hours, [...] See yonder what a change is made! ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sighed,</b> <b>and</b> leaned {{a little}} towards him. Her eyes were soft and dusky, her red lips a little parted.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sighed,</b> <b>and</b> said it. He {{kissed her}} passionately. It was {{only by a}} {{resolute}} effort that she released herself.|$|E
6000|$|When Saxon at last {{lapsed into}} {{complete}} silence, {{he studied her}} anxiously, with quick sidelong glances. <b>She</b> <b>sighed</b> <b>and</b> asked: ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sighed</b> again <b>and</b> {{looked away}} to the east with a strange, unchildish, set stare in her eyes. She was trying to realize it.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sighed</b> gently, <b>and</b> {{her eyes}} flashed her regrets. Very blue eyes they were to-day, almost as blue as the turquoises about her throat.|$|R
6000|$|But {{the next}} night, hearing that <b>she</b> was <b>sighing</b> <b>and</b> restless Mrs. Davilow said, [...] "Let {{me give you}} your sleeping-draught, Gwendolen." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>sighed,</b> <b>and</b> {{looking at}} him with an {{expression}} of tender reproach. [...] "I wonder whether I can believe you," [...] she said softly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, Mr. Flanders," [...] she said, {{speaking}} proudly, {{as if to}} Lord Lansdowne himself. Then <b>she</b> <b>sighed</b> <b>and</b> {{began to}} wind her wool again.|$|E
60|$|In {{such matters}} Linda {{had always been}} guided by others; so <b>she</b> <b>sighed</b> <b>and</b> promised, and the {{engagement}} was duly ratified by all the parties concerned.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> paused, <b>sighed,</b> <b>and</b> {{pressed her}} open {{hand on her}} bosom; unconsciously betraying in that action some of the ineradicable {{training}} of the theatre.|$|R
6000|$|The gods, {{to curse}} Pamela with her prayers, Gave the gilt coach and dappled Flanders mares, [...] 50 The shining robes, rich jewels, beds of state, And, to {{complete}} her bliss, a fool for mate. She glares in balls, front boxes, and the Ring, A vain, unquiet, glittering, wretched thing! Pride, pomp, and state but reach her outward part: <b>She</b> <b>sighs,</b> <b>and</b> is no duchess at her heart.|$|R
6000|$|... "Two {{thousand}} pounds!" [...] <b>She</b> actually <b>sighed,</b> <b>and</b> {{lost her}} appetite for the oyster patty {{with which she}} had been trifling. Trent looked around the table.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it so many?" [...] cried Mrs. Bowen, with lovely dismay. [...] "Yes, it is," [...] <b>she</b> <b>sighed,</b> <b>and</b> she did {{not speak}} for an appreciable interval.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sighed</b> <b>and</b> sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son {{watched her}} face as it was lifted, and her small, {{work-hardened}} hands fingering at the bow under her chin.|$|E
6000|$|... "She's {{doing more}} for the cause than any of us. She's giving her youth--for, alas! when I was young there were {{domestic}} circumstances--" [...] <b>she</b> <b>sighed,</b> <b>and</b> stopped short.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sighed</b> a little, <b>and</b> {{seemed to}} look back tenderly on the past.|$|R
6000|$|I am {{not sure}} whether Frances had accorded due {{attention}} to my harangue; instead of answering me with her usual respectful promptitude, <b>she</b> only <b>sighed</b> <b>and</b> said,-- ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> mused, <b>and</b> <b>sighed,</b> <b>and</b> {{turned to}} him with {{something}} pathetic in her.|$|R
