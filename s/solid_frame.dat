5|$|Soon after {{establishing}} his Hartford factory, Colt set out {{to establish}} a factory in Europe and chose London. He organized a large display of his firearms at the Great Exhibition of 1851 at Hyde Park, London and ingratiated himself by presenting cased engraved Colt revolvers to such appropriate officials as Britain's Master General of the Ordnance. At one exhibit Colt disassembled ten guns and reassembled ten guns using different parts from different guns. As the world's leading proponent of mass production techniques, Colt went on to deliver a lecture on the subject to the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) in London. The membership rewarded his efforts by awarding him the Silver Telford Medal. With help from ICE secretary, Charles Manby, Colt established his London operation near Vauxhall Bridge on the Thames River and began production on January 1, 1853. On {{a tour of the}} factory, Charles Dickens was so impressed with the facilities that he recorded his favorable comments of Colt's revolvers in an 1852 edition of Household Words. The factory's machines mass-produced its parts that were completely interchangeable and could be put together on assembly lines using standardized patterns and gauges by unskilled labor as opposed to England's top gun makers making each part by hand. Colt's London factory remained in operation for only four years. Unwilling to alter his open-top single-action design for the <b>solid</b> <b>frame</b> double-action revolver that the British asked for; Colt scarcely sold 23,000 revolvers to the British Army and Navy. In 1856 he closed the London plant and had the machinery, tooling, and unfinished guns shipped to Hartford.|$|E
500|$|The Webley RIC (Royal Irish Constabulary) {{model was}} Webley's first {{double-action}} revolver, and {{adopted by the}} RIC in 1868, hence the name. It was a <b>solid</b> <b>frame,</b> gate-loaded revolver, chambered in [...]442 Webley. General George Armstrong Custer was known to have owned a pair, which he {{is believed to have}} used at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876.|$|E
500|$|The {{graphics}} {{were seen}} {{as one of the}} strongest aspects of the game. Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot wrote: [...] "graphically, Banjo-Kazooie takes it to another level. The game maintains {{the look and feel of}} Mario 64, but instead of flat, shaded polygons, [...] uses a lot of textures". The game's long draw distance, <b>solid</b> <b>frame</b> rate, special lighting, transparency effects, and animations were also highlighted very positively. Critics also praised the game's dynamic soundtrack. Schneider remarked that it [...] "lets players know where they are going. This happens all the time and in every level. It's all very Disney-esque." [...] The sound effects received similar praise, with several editors crediting the unique and diverse speech patterns of the characters.|$|E

The Model 1897 was an {{evolution of the}} Winchester Model 1893 designed by John Browning. From 1897 until 1957, over one million of these shotguns were produced. The Model 1897 was offered in numerous barrel lengths and grades, chambered in 12 and 16 gauge, and as a <b>solid</b> <b>frame</b> or takedown. The 16-gauge guns had a standard barrel length of 28inches, while 12-gauge guns were furnished with 30-inch length barrels. Special length barrels could be ordered in lengths as short as 20inches, {{and as long as}} 36inches. Since the time the Model 1897 was first manufactured it has been used by American soldiers, police departments, and hunters.|$|E
500|$|In 1887, the British Army {{was searching}} for a {{revolver}} to replace the largely unsatisfactory [...]476 Enfield Mk I & Mk II Revolvers, the Enfield having only replaced the <b>solid</b> <b>frame</b> Adams [...]450 revolver which was a late 1860s conversion of the cap and ball Beaumont–Adams revolver in 1880. Webley & Scott, who were already very well known makers of quality guns and had sold many pistols on a commercial basis to military officers and civilians alike, tendered the [...]455 calibre Webley Self-Extracting Revolver for trials. [...] The military was suitably impressed with the revolver (it {{was seen as a}} vast improvement over the Enfield revolvers then in service, as the American designed Owen extraction system did not prove particularly satisfactory), and it was adopted on 8 November 1887 as the [...] "Pistol, Webley, Mk I". The initial contract called for 10,000 Webley revolvers, at a price of £3/1/1 each, with at least 2,000 revolvers to be supplied within eight months.|$|E
500|$|Originally, Descent 3 was {{intended}} to support both a software and a hardware renderer, implying that the rendering process of the game could take place either in the CPU or dedicated hardware like a video card. However, about six months after starting development, the team decided {{to go with a}} hardware-only renderer because it allowed them to create [...] "visually stunning" [...] graphics and maintain a <b>solid</b> <b>frame</b> rate without worrying about the limitations imposed by the software renderer. This was a difficult decision since the team had to scrap many tools and software rendering technology that were already developed. In addition, computers with hardware acceleration were not common at the time the decision was made. As the developers noted, [...] "We knew just by looking at our progress on the game under acceleration that we had a beautiful looking game with all the latest technologies — but would anyone actually be able to play it?" [...] Fortunately, as development progressed, hardware acceleration became more popular with each passing year. The game natively supports the Direct3D, Glide and OpenGL rendering APIs for graphics, and the A3D and DirectSound3D technologies for sound.|$|E

500|$|The Winchester Model 1897 was {{designed}} by American firearms inventor John Moses Browning. The Model 1897 was first listed {{for sale in the}} November 1897 [...] as a 12 gauge <b>solid</b> <b>frame.</b> However, the 12 gauge takedown was added in October 1898, and the 16 gauge takedown in February 1900. Originally produced as a tougher, stronger and more improved version of the Winchester 1893, itself an improvement on the early Spencer pump gun, the 1897 was identical to its forerunner, except that the receiver was thicker and allowed for use of smokeless powder shells, which were not common at the time. [...] The 1897 introduced a [...] "take down" [...] design, where the barrel could be taken off – a standard in pump shotguns made today, like the Remington 870 and Mossberg 500 series. Over time, [...] "the model 97 became the most popular shotgun on the American market and established a standard of performance by which other kinds and makes of shotguns were judged, including the most expensive imported articles". The Winchester Model 1897 was in production from 1897 until 1957. It was in this time frame that the [...] "modern" [...] hammerless designs became common, like the Winchester Model 1912 and the Remington 870. The Model 1897 was superseded by the Winchester Model 1912. However, the gun can still be found today in regular use.|$|E
500|$|Willington {{noted that}} the game's visuals {{experienced}} aliasing, and Wipeout 2048 was [...] "undercutting the point" [...] of Wipeout HD (a PlayStation 3 title). An Edge reviewer also called its visuals less exciting than the Wipeout series' typical science-fiction setting, noting that Studio Liverpool [...] "rewinds the timeline" [...] to a less futuristic, more relatable setting. Martin Gaston of VideoGamer.com said that Wipeout 2048 featured a different (not inferior) aesthetic design from the other games due to its [...] "closer to home", near-future setting. According to GameSpot's Mark Walton, the game's smooth, beautiful visuals gave the player a real feeling of speed and provided breathtaking vistas but was somewhat lacking in innovation. Paul Furfari of UGO enjoyed Wipeout 2048 visual style, calling it the only showcase for the PlayStation Vita's raw power. He singled out the Tron-like visual presentation of the Zone mode and the game's generally <b>solid</b> <b>frame</b> rate. Dale North of Destructoid said that the series consistently showcased the system on which they were released and Wipeout 2048 was a good launch title for the PlayStation Vita. North called it a beautiful game; [...] "as fast and flashy as its predecessors", it [...] "really impresses" [...] on the PlayStation Vita's high-resolution screen and the ships and futuristic backdrops seem to [...] "pop right off the screen". Sebastian Haley of VentureBeat wrote that the game adheres to the familiar, high visual standard set by previous Wipeout instalments.|$|E
500|$|The British company Webley & Scott (P. Webley & Son before {{merger with}} W & C Scott in 1897) {{produced}} {{a range of}} revolvers from the mid 19th to late 20th centuries. [...] As early as 1853 P. Webley and J. Webley began production of their first patented single action cap and ball revolvers. [...] Later under the trade name of P. Webley and Son, manufacturing included their own [...]44-caliber rim-fire <b>solid</b> <b>frame</b> revolver as well as licensed copies of Smith & Wesson's Tip up break action revolvers. [...] The quintessential hinged frame, centre-fire revolvers for which the Webley name is best known first began production/development in the early 1870s most notably with the Webley-Pryse (1877) and Webley-Kaufman (1881) models. [...] The W.G. or Webley-Government models produced from 1885 through to the early 1900s, (often incorrectly {{referred to as the}} Webley-Green) are the most popular of the commercial top break revolvers and many were the private purchase choice of English military officers and target shooters in the period, coming in a [...]476/.455 calibre. [...] However other short-barrel solid-frame revolvers, including the Webley RIC (Royal Irish Constabulary) model and the British Bulldog revolver, designed to be carried in a coat pocket for self-defence were far more commonplace during the period. [...] Today, undoubtedly best-known are the range of military revolvers, which were in service use across two World Wars and numerous colonial conflicts.|$|E

500|$|Critics praised Wipeout 2048 {{graphics}} and visuals, calling them {{a showcase for}} the PlayStation Vita's power. Cam Shea of IGN enjoyed the game's detail and depth but questioned its visual design, saying that the game's darker environments and cluttered worlds made the tracks ambiguous and less readable. Adam Goodall of Gameplanet called the graphics stunning {{and said that the}} game had a pervasive artistic statement, something he considered rare in video games (particularly racing games). According to Digital Spys Mark Langshaw and GamesRadar's Kathryn Bailey, the game's backdrops were superior to Wipeout HD; Langshaw said that they showcased the PlayStation Vita's graphical prowess. David Meikleham of the Official PlayStation Magazine wrote that Wipeout 2048 [...] "brilliantly shows off" [...] the new hardware with its attractive lighting effects, <b>solid</b> <b>frame</b> rate and wide range of colours, and Dan Ryckert of Game Informer said that its fast-paced races [...] "do a good job" [...] of displaying the Vita's graphical capabilities. Frédéric Goyon of Jeuxvideo.com liked the game's utilisation of the PlayStation Vita's OLED screen, although he saw little difference between the graphical enhancements of Wipeout 2048 and Wipeout HD. According to Goyon, the game was [...] "fluid in all circumstances" [...] and was essentially Wipeout HD on a smaller screen. Heath Hindman of Game Revolution said that although it [...] "really shows off" [...] the PlayStation Vita's graphical power (along with Uncharted: Golden Abyss, another launch title), the game's sight distance was limited. Wipeout 2048 track design was largely praised. Simon Parkin of The Guardian enjoyed its [...] "wholly contemporary" [...] track details and visual consistency with previous instalments, and Peter Willington of Pocket Gamer called the game's track design the best in the series. According to Sebastian Haley of VentureBeat, Wipeout 2048 would have benefited from a [...] "slightly braver" [...] track design.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} ways to {{determine}} the porosity of aerogel: the three main methods are gas adsorption, mercury porosimetry, and scattering method. In gas adsorption, nitrogen at its boiling point is adsorbed into the aerogel sample. The gas being adsorbed is dependent {{on the size of the}} pores within the sample and on the partial pressure of the gas relative to its saturation pressure. [...] The volume of the gas adsorbed is measured by using the Brunauer, Emmit and Teller formula (BET), which gives the specific surface area of the sample. [...] At high partial pressure in the adsorption/desorption the Kelvin equation gives the pore size distribution of the sample. [...] In mercury porosimetry, the mercury is forced into the aerogel porous system to determine the pores' size, but this method is highly inefficient since the <b>solid</b> <b>frame</b> of aerogel will collapse from the high compressive force. [...] The scattering method involves the angle-dependent deflection of radiation within the aerogel sample. [...] The sample can be solid particles or pores. [...] The radiation goes into the material and determines the fractal geometry of the aerogel pore network. [...] The best radiation wavelengths to use are X-rays and neutrons. [...] Aerogel is also an open porous network: the difference between an open porous network and a closed porous network is that in the open network, gases can enter and leave the substance without any limitation, while a closed porous network traps the gases within the material forcing them to stay within the pores. The high porosity and surface area of silica aerogels allow them to be used in a variety of environmental filtration applications.|$|E

One was beautifully engraved, and inlaid with gold--the most elaborate [...] .30 Gov't the Winchester people had ever built. Another was a walnut-stocked, shot-gun butted, fancy checkered take-down.
