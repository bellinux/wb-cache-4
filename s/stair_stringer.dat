50|$|The {{easiest way}} to {{calculate}} the rise and run {{is to use a}} <b>stair</b> <b>stringer</b> calculator, the amount of spindles you need is calculated based on the width of the spindles {{and the fact that the}} distance between each spindle should be 99mm or less.|$|E
50|$|The snake mouth portal decorates {{the facade}} of a small room, which is located {{laterally}} in {{a long series of}} rooms. The space jumps from the series of spaces in front of more than half a meter, and thus creates the typical for the Chenes style impression of individual buildings. The actual entrance is unusually narrow, and is three steps above the ground. The otherwise mostly encountered platform in front of the entrance, which is pushed forward lower jaw is missing here. After the completion of the building a staircase was set on the back that leads up to the roof of the room. There, a small room was probably built or at least planned. In order to stabilize the roof for that extra space, the back wall was reinforced to almost half of the vault with a masonry core, which was covered on the front with stucco. From the back of a reconstructed in its lower part staircase leads to the upper room. It is unusual that the staircase has at its center a central <b>stair</b> <b>stringer,</b> which is designed as a tail or abdomen of the reptile, and the turn ends in a small snake throat.|$|E
50|$|Wall {{sections}} usually {{include a}} bottom plate which is secured {{to the structure of}} a floor, and one, or more often two top plates that tie walls together and provide a bearing for structures above the wall. Wood or steel floor frames usually include a rim joist around the perimeter of a system of floor joists, and often include bridging material near the center of a span to prevent lateral buckling of the spanning members. In two-story construction, openings are left in the floor system for a stairwell, in which stair risers and treads are most often attached to squared faces cut into sloping <b>stair</b> <b>stringers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Galvin {{worked closely}} with the needs of the manager {{director}} of Stockland and his executive team; the development company was going through significant change at the time and needed a space to allow maximum work efficiency. The design challenge was working with the eight levels of the existing structure. Galvin and her team suggested the use of voids that would create visual allowances between the staggered levels and structural bays, these voids then creating a sense of altering scales in verticality. The centralised <b>stairs</b> <b>stringers</b> are painted red to symbolise Enid Blyton’s red slippery-dip in the children’s novel The Folk and the Faraway Tree.|$|R
50|$|The main entrance, {{framed by}} square pilasters, {{sidelights}} and a transom with {{a pattern of}} repeating semicircles set in a rectangular border, holds a stained and varnished door with recessed panels decorated in a leaf-and-dart pattern. It opens into an entrance hall with a switchback <b>stair,</b> its open <b>stringers</b> decorated with a scroll relief. The newel at the base consists of a square bottom with a round turned post carved in an acanthus leaf relief pattern. It is capped in a carved acanthus scroll. Narrow turned balusters support the handrail, and four Doric columns support the landing and upper run.|$|R
50|$|The Lexington federal {{building}} has two ornamental, oval-shaped entry lobbies at {{the southeast and}} southwest entries. The southeast entry lobby houses the grand staircase, and the southwest lobby the passenger elevators. These oval lobbies originally opened onto the public lobby and, by extension, to the postal lobby of the first floor. The current postal lobby was sealed-off via aluminum doors and the finishes have been completely altered from the original appearance. The southwest (main) entry lobby is an oval-shaped space. The rounded walls are clad with full height polished St. Genevieve Golden Vein marble. The floors are buff terrazzo with brass divider strips and a Westfield Green marble border and base. The panel ceilings are painted plaster with a painted plaster cornice ornamented with a triglyph motif. The elevators are set back in the marble and the original elevator doors are decorative bronze with cast bronze panels featuring an urn motif in the center. The decorative lintels feature egg and dart, dentil and scroll patterns with a modified keystone directly over the elevator doors. The southeast oval-shaped entry lobby contains the main staircase of the building. The finishes of this lobby {{are the same as}} the southwest with a couple of exceptions. The main staircase curves into the lobby at the north wall. The stair treads are fine sand-rubbed Appalachian Golden Vein marble; the risers, and <b>stair</b> and wall <b>stringers</b> are polished Appalachian Golden Vein marble. The public lobby is 120' long. The floors are buff terrazzo with Westfield Green marble border and base. The walls are punctuated by a series of marble engaged pilasters supporting a polychrome crown mold band with triglyphs. Between the pilasters is wainscot of polished St. Genevieve Golden Vein marble to a height of 3'.|$|R
