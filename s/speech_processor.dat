40|$|Previous work {{suggests}} that bilateral cochlear implant users {{are sensitive to}} interaural cues if experimental <b>speech</b> <b>processors</b> are used to preserve accurate interaural information in the electrical stimulation pattern. Binaural unmasking occurs in adults and children when an interaural delay {{is applied to the}} envelope of a high-rate pulse train. Nevertheless, for speech perception, binaural unmasking benefits have not been demonstrated consistently, even with coordinated stimulation at both ears. The present study aimed at bridging the gap between basic psychophysical performance on binaural signal detection tasks {{on the one hand and}} binaural perception of speech in noise on the other hand. Therefore, binaural signal detection was expanded to multi-channel stimulation and biologically relevant interaural delays. A harmonic complex, consisting of three sinusoids (125, 250, and 375 Hz), was added to three 125 -Hz-wide noise bands centered on the sinusoids. When an interaural delay of 700 μs was introduced, an average BMLD of 3 dB was established. Outcomes are promising in view of real-life benefits. Future research should investigate the generalization of the observed benefits for signal detection to speech perception in everyday listening situations and determine the importance of coordination of bilateral <b>speech</b> <b>processors</b> and accentuation of envelope cues. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Cochlear implant <b>speech</b> <b>processors</b> {{transmit}} temporal {{features of}} sound as amplitude modulation of constant-rate electrical pulse trains. This study evaluated the central representation of amplitude modulation {{in the form}} of phase-locked firing of neurons in the auditory cortex. Anesthetized pigmented guinea pigs were implanted with cochlear electrode arrays. Stimuli were 254 pulse/s (pps) trains of biphasic electrical pulses, sinusoidally modulated with frequencies of 10 – 64 Hz and modulation depths of − 40 to − 5 dB re 100 % (i. e., 1 – 56. 2 % modulation). Single- and multiunit activity was recorded from multi-site silicon-substrate probes. The maximum frequency for significant phase locking (limiting modulation frequency) was ≥ 60 Hz for 42 % of recording sites, whereas phase locking to pulses of unmodulated pulse trains rarely exceeded 30 pps. The strength of phase locking to frequencies ≥ 40 Hz often varied nonmonotonically with modulation depth, commonly peaking at modulation depths around − 15 to − 10 dB. Cortical phase locking coded modulation frequency reliably, whereas a putative rate code for frequency was confounded by rate changes with modulation depth. Group delay computed from the slope of mean phase versus modulation frequency tended to increase with decreasing limiting modulation frequency. Neurons in cortical extragranular layers had lower limiting modulation frequencies than did neurons in thalamic afferent layers. Those observations suggest that the low-pass characteristic of cortical phase locking results from intracortical filtering mechanisms. The results show that cortical neurons can phase lock to modulated electrical pulse trains across the range of modulation frequencies and depths presented by cochlear implant <b>speech</b> <b>processors...</b>|$|R

This paper presents a set of implementation specifications to improve algorithm performance and minimize algorithm computation and memory requirements.

40|$|Recent {{simulations}} of continuous interleaved sampling (CIS) cochlear implant <b>speech</b> <b>processors</b> have used acoustic stimulation that provides only weak cues to pitch, periodicity, and aperiodicity, although these {{are regarded as}} important perceptual factors of speech. Four-channel vocoders simulating CIS processors have been constructed, in which the salience of speech-derived periodicity and pitch information was manipulated. The highest salience of pitch and periodicity was provided by an explicit encoding, using a pulse carrier following fundamental frequency for voiced speech, and a noise carrier during voiceless <b>speech.</b> Other <b>processors</b> included noise-excited vocoders with envelope cutoff frequencies of 32 and 400 Hz. The use of a pulse carrier following fundamental frequency gave substantially higher performance in identification of frequency glides than did vocoders using envelope-modulated noise carriers.
