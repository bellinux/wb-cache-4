40|$|Length {{frequency}} {{data are}} {{a key component of}} stock assessments that use Multifan-CL, and {{it is important to have}} consistent, representative time series. Detailed information about sampling protocols is needed in order to establish that sampling is unbiased, and is consistent. In the south Pacific albacore stock assessment, conflict is evident between the length frequency data and the CPUE data. The organization responsible for port sampling at the albacore canneries in Pago Pago changed in 1971, and so did the <b>sampling</b> <b>protocol.</b> However, details of the <b>sampling</b> <b>protocol</b> before 1971 are not available. The statistical distribution of the data also changes at this time, and this change affects the stock assessment. Removing pre- 1971 Pago Pago sampling data from the south Pacific albacore stock assessment changed the assessment results, and improved the fit of the model to the data. We recommend omitting these data from future stock assessments, due to lack of information about the <b>sampling</b> <b>protocol.</b> We further note the importance of representative sampling, thorough documentation, and consistent methodologies. We also note the importance of resolving conflicts in information between data sources, either by adjusting the model or excluding some of the data.

40|$|Naturalistic {{research}} {{methods have been}} developed to collect data in the daily environment, providing ecological valid measures. Recent reports suggest, however, that compliance with fixed time sampling protocols may be problematic and can bias results. This study investigated compliance with an intensive, random time <b>sampling</b> <b>protocol</b> for salivary cortisol and effects of non-compliance on cortisol results. Twenty female twin pairs and nineteen of their sisters were instructed to take saliva samples when signaled at ten unpredictable moments on each of five consecutive days. Subjects recorded collection times, unaware that compliance with the <b>sampling</b> <b>protocol</b> was being investigated by means of electronic monitoring devices. Samples taken < or = 15 min after the signal, according to self-report, were defined as adherent to the protocol. Samples taken < or = 10 min after the self-reported collection time, according to the monitor, were defined as accurate. Self-reported adherence to the <b>sampling</b> <b>protocol</b> was 96. 4 %. Verified compliance was somewhat lower, with 81 % of all saliva samples accurately timed. Contrary to previous reports, inclusion of non-compliant samples in the analysis did not distort the cortisol diurnal profile. Intensive, random time sampling appears to have advantages over fixed time sampling for obtaining valid cortisol profiles when researchers do not have devices to monitor compliance. Results indirectly support the validity of momentary self-report data about daily experiences obtained with the same sampling methods. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Biological {{sampling}} of fish during research vessel survey cruises is often conducted using length-stratified age sampling schemes. Maturity-at-length or age {{may be affected}} by changes in sampling protocols, and may potentially result in biased estimates of matu-ration patterns. In such cases, these estimates may be artifacts of the sampling activities and not accurate estimators of stock dynamics. In 1992, the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) modified the length-strati-fied age <b>sampling</b> <b>protocol</b> used during semi-annual research vessel bottom trawl surveys. While demonstrable gains in the precision of age-length keys for many species have been obtained with the new protocols, no systematic evaluation {{of the effects of}} the <b>sampling</b> <b>protocol</b> change upon maturity-at-length or age has been performed. In this study, potential effects of changes in <b>sampling</b> <b>protocol</b> were assessed for two groundfish species, haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) and American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides). Over the critical size range of maturity for both species, significantly different length frequency sampling was obtained from each sampling scheme during the 10 -year study period. Analyses for American plaice were complicated by the sexually dimorphic growth. Simulation techniques were employed to assess whether the observed changes in maturity estimates were a result of the changed sampling protocols. The simulations suggested that these changes were real phenomena and not artifacts caused by changes in sampling. Key words: length-stratified sampling, maturity-at-lengt...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{ciprofloxacin}} treatment on theophylline clearance was evaluated with a theophylline multiple dose, multiple <b>sample</b> <b>protocol</b> {{and with a}} single dose, single <b>sample</b> <b>protocol.</b> The object {{was to determine whether}} a single dose, single <b>sample</b> <b>protocol</b> for estimating theophylline clearance {{could be used as a}} screening strategy for evaluating host factor influences on theophylline clearance. Ciprofloxacin (750 mg per os) was administered every 12 h for nine doses in the multidose study and every 12 h for seven doses in the single dose protocol. Subjects were sixteen healthy, non-smoking young adult males. The oral clearance of theophylline at steady state, (CL/F) ss, decreased from a mean (+/- s. d.) value of 0. 035 (+/- 0. 008) 1 h- 1 kg- 1 to 0. 024 (+/- 0. 004) 1 h- 1 kg- 1 during ciprofloxacin treatment. Single sample estimates of theophylline clearance, CL/F, similarly decreased from 0. 040 (+/- 0. 014) 1 h- 1 kg- 1 to 0. 018 (+/- 0. 008) 1 h- 1 kg- 1. Mean theophylline clearances were significantly different when comparing control with ciprofloxacin treatment means (P less than 0. 01), but were not different when comparing single sample vs multiple sample clearances for a given treatment (i. e. control or ciprofloxacin). It is concluded that a single dose, single sample strategy may be used in screening for host-factor influences on theophylline clearance...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION Economic {{survey data}} are often {{obtained}} from <b>sampling</b> <b>protocols</b> that involve stratification, censoring, or selection. Econometric estimators designed for random samples may be inconsistent or inefficient {{when applied to}} these samples. Several strands in the econometrics literature have investigated estimators appropriate to such data: seminal papers of Heckman (1974) on sample selection, and Manski and Lerman (1977) on choice-based sampling; further work on endogenous stratification by Hausman and Wise (1977), Manski and McFadden (1981), Cosslett (1981), and Hsieh, Manski, and McFadden (1984); and related work on switching regression by Goldfeld and Quandt (1973, 1975), Madalla and Nelson (1974), and Lee and Porter (1984).

40|$|Within-site {{variability}} in species detectability {{is a problem}} common to many biodiversity assessments and can strongly bias the results. Such variability {{can be caused by}} many factors, including simple counting inaccuracies, which can be solved by increasing sample size, or by temporal changes in species behavior, meaning that the way the temporal <b>sampling</b> <b>protocol</b> is designed is also very important. Here we use the example of mist-netted tropical birds to determine how design decisions in the temporal <b>sampling</b> <b>protocol</b> can alter the data collected and how these changes might affect the detection of ecological patterns, such as the species-area relationship (SAR). Using data from almost 3400 birds captured from 21, 000 net-hours at 31 sites in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, we found that the magnitude of ecological trends remained fairly stable, but the probability of detecting statistically significant ecological patterns varied depending on sampling effort, time of day and season in which sampling was conducted. For example, more species were detected in the wet season, but the SAR was strongest in the dry season. We found that the temporal distribution of sampling effort was more important than its total amount, discovering that similar ecological results could have been obtained with one-third of the total effort, as long as each site had been equally sampled over 2 yr. We discuss that projects with the same sampling effort and spatial design, but with different temporal <b>sampling</b> <b>protocol</b> are likely to report different ecological patterns, which may ultimately lead to inappropriate conservation strategies.
