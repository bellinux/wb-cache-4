5|$|Statistical {{analysis}} has been undertaken {{on several occasions}} to try to ascertain the authorship question based on word frequencies and writing styles.

50|$|Research at both NDSU and UND has an {{economic}} {{impact on the}} state of North Dakota. A 2007 <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> that research at UND had a statewide economic impact of $135.7 million. The same <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> that UND research generated a total of 1,649 jobs, of which 728 were on campus. Another 2007 <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> that research at NDSU had a statewide economic impact of $100 million.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{systematic}} review was to summarise evidence {{on the effects of}} job rotation on musculoskeletal complaints, exposures related to musculoskeletal complaints and sustainable working life parameters. A total of 16 studies were included. No studies on sustainable working life parameters were found. The quality of the studies was assessed using a checklist; eight field studies and three laboratory studies of sufficient quality were used to summarise the following evidence: one field <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> positive results and one field <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> negative results for musculoskeletal complaints, two field <b>studies</b> <b>showed</b> positive results and two field <b>studies</b> <b>showed</b> inconsistent results for exposures, and two field <b>studies</b> <b>showed</b> inconsistent results for musculoskeletal complaints and exposures. Two laboratory <b>studies</b> <b>showed</b> inconsistent results and one laboratory <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> no changes for exposures. In conclusion, there is currently inconsistent evidence for positive or negative effects of job rotation on musculoskeletal complaints and exposures related to musculoskeletal complaints. Practitioner's Summary: Currently, there is inconsistent evidence for recommending job rotation as a strategy for preventing musculoskeletal complaints. Exposures from all involved work activities and body regions should be identified and assessed first, to determine if job rotation provides increased exposure variation and/or beneficial changes in mean exposures related to musculoskeletal complaint...|$|R

5|$|A 2012 {{study on}} the effects of {{rainfall}} patterns and parasite infections on the body of the springbok in Etosha National Park observed that males and juveniles were in better health {{toward the end of the}} rainy season. Health of females was more affected by parasites than by rainfall; parasite count in females peaked prior to and immediately after parturition. <b>Studies</b> <b>show</b> that springbok host helminths (Haemonchus, Longistrongylus and Trichostrongylus), ixodid ticks (Rhipicephalus species), lice (Damalinia and Linognathus species). Eimeria species mainly affect juveniles.|$|E
5|$|Alex George {{described}} {{the plant in}} his 1981 monograph of the genus Banksia as a variety of Banksia integrifolia, but later reclassified it as a separate species. Genetic <b>studies</b> <b>show</b> it {{to be related to}} Banksia plagiocarpa, Banksia oblongifolia and Banksia robur. The species is found in wet sclerophyll forest and rainforest margins on sandy soils. Banksia aquilonia regenerates after bushfire by regrowing from epicormic buds under its bark. It is rarely cultivated.|$|E

50|$|The {{third party}} studies {{reported}} either null results, correlated results, or contradictory results in which beneficiaries of prayer had worsened health outcomes.

5|$|Banksia dentata {{is one of}} four Banksia species {{collected}} by Sir Joseph Banks in 1770, and one of the four species published in 1782 as part of Carolus Linnaeus the Younger's original description of Banksia. Within the genus, it is classified in the series Salicinae, a group of species from Australia's eastern states. Genetic <b>studies</b> <b>show</b> it is a basal member (early offshoot) within the group. Banksia dentata is found in tropical grassland known as savanna, associated with Pandanus and Melaleuca. It regenerates from bushfire by regrowing from its woody base, known as a lignotuber.|$|E
5|$|Bottlenose dolphins, {{the genus}} Tursiops, {{are the most}} common members of the family Delphinidae, the family of oceanic dolphin. Recent {{molecular}} <b>studies</b> <b>show</b> the genus contains two species, the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) and the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus), instead of one. Research in 2011 revealed a third species, the Burrunan dolphin (Tursiops australis). Bottlenose dolphins inhabit warm and temperate seas worldwide. They live in all oceans except for the Arctic and Antarctic Circle regions.|$|E

5|$|Frome {{town centre}} {{contains}} {{a considerable number}} of independent shops, and a few chain stores. Retail is primarily aimed at serving the local population's requirements for food (there are two large supermarkets on opposite edges of the town, and three smaller supermarkets in the town centre), basic clothing, health and beauty, DIY and some electrical goods. However <b>studies</b> <b>show</b> that only {{about a quarter of the}} town's population do their non-food shopping in the town. Banks and building societies have branches in the town centre.|$|E
5|$|Human {{eyes have}} color receptors known as cone cells, {{of which there}} are three types. In some cases, one is missing or faulty, which can cause color blindness, {{including}} the common inability to distinguish red and yellow from green, known as deuteranopia or redgreen color blindness. Green is restful to the eye. <b>Studies</b> <b>show</b> that a green environment can reduce fatigue.|$|E

5|$|Obesity and {{metabolic}} syndrome are both {{closely related to}} plasma triglyceride levels. Therefore, the focus on an association between APOA5 and BMI or {{metabolic syndrome}} is understandable. Available <b>studies</b> <b>show</b> that minor APOA5 alleles could be associated with an enhanced risk of obesity or metabolic syndrome development. However, genome wide studies have failed to prove that APOA5 is a gene associated with BMI values and/or obesity, so the effect could be far from clinically significant or at least significantly context-dependent.|$|E
5|$|Often feminist economists use country-level {{or smaller}} case studies focused on {{developing}} and often understudied countries or populations. For example, Michael Kevane and Leslie C. Gray examine how gendered social norms {{are central to}} understanding agricultural activities in Burkina Faso. Cristina Carrasco and Arantxa Rodriquez examine the care economy in Spain to suggest that women's entrance into the labor market requires more equitable caregiving responsibilities. Such <b>studies</b> <b>show</b> the importance of local social norms, government policies and cultural situations. Feminist economists see such variation as a crucial factor {{to be included in}} economics.|$|E

Even though the diploid hybrid is rarely collected, allozyme <b>studies</b> <b>show</b> that A.bradleyi has multiple origins; that is, different populations of A.bradleyi have originated from the chromosome doubling of independently formed diploids. Despite their independent origins, these populations are probably interfertile and not reproductively isolated from one another.|$|E
