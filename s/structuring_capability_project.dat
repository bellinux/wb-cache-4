40|$|This article {{provides}} a foundation to guide future research on <b>project</b> <b>capabilities</b> based on three main contributions. First, drawing upon research on dynamic capabilities and organisational ambidexterity, {{we suggest that}} innovative and routine dimensions of <b>project</b> <b>capabilities</b> are developed and mobilised {{to deal with the}} variety of exploratory and exploitative conditions facing an organisation. Second, we distinguish between <b>project</b> <b>capabilities</b> at the operational and dynamic capabilities at the strategic levels, arguing that firms depend on identifiable dynamic capabilities (e. g. portfolio management techniques) to know when and how to maintain current <b>project</b> <b>capabilities</b> and when to modify or replace them depending on the conditions encountered. Third, we suggest that the relationship between dynamic and <b>project</b> <b>capabilities</b> is reciprocal, recursive and mutually reinforcing. In this reciprocal relationship, the emergence of new or declining <b>project</b> <b>capabilities</b> provides indications for the strategic priorities, behaviours and future deployment of an organisation's dynamic capabilities...|$|R
