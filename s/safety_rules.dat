Two months after Conner said she ended the affair, Birchtree Healthcare was cited by state regulators for numerous violations of health and <b>safety</b> <b>rules.</b> By July 2002, the state had pulled all Medicare and Medicaid payments from the facility, which soon went bankrupt. Conner further alleged that the state investigation of Birchtree was retaliation by Patton for her ending of the affair.|$|E
5|$|After many {{boats were}} wrecked and {{several hundred people}} died, the North-West Mounted Police (NWMP) {{introduced}} <b>safety</b> <b>rules,</b> vetting the boats carefully and forbidding women and children to travel through the rapids. Additional rules stated that any boat carrying passengers required a licensed pilot, typically costing $25 ($680), although some prospectors simply unpacked their boats and let them drift unmanned through the rapids {{with the intent of}} walking down to collect them on the other side. During the summer, a horse-powered rail-tramway was built by Norman Macaulay, capable of carrying boats and equipment through the canyon at $25 ($680) a time, removing the need for prospectors to navigate the rapids.|$|E
5|$|Catastrophic {{injuries}} {{have been}} on a steady decline since the 1960s, due in part to rules banning dangerous forms of contact such as spearing, face tackling and butt blocking. However, catastrophic injuries are still caused by helmet-to-helmet collisions, as well when players hit their heads against an opposing player's knee or the ground. Returning to play after sustaining a head injury earlier in the game also places players at risk for an even more severe injury. Many states are requiring teams to prevent players who have shown any signs of a concussion from returning to a game, while other steps such as more aggressive enforcement of <b>safety</b> <b>rules</b> and better condition of the neck muscles have been suggested. Additionally, coaches are being urged to train players to block with their shoulders instead of their heads.|$|E

5|$|While {{the primary}} focus is on driver safety near {{railroad}} crossings, other basic driving <b>safety</b> <b>rules</b> are reinforced, such as not passing on hills or curves, not driving or pulling over when fatigued or sleepy and not being a distracted driver. Alan is also shown a police report of an accident where an acquaintance of his had died in an accident due to his reckless driving. Filling out the film is a nostalgic {{look back at the}} early 1900s, when such things as horseless carriages were parts of everyday life and four-lane superhighways—in the late 1950s still a relatively new concept—weren't even thought of, and slower and less congested roadways meant fewer dangers in driving; however, Hal cautions that his point is that the human body hasn't changed and that even more attention to safety must be heeded.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1980s, the 767 {{spearheaded the}} growth of twinjet flights across the {{northern}} Atlantic under extended-range twin-engine operational performance standards (ETOPS) regulations, the FAA's <b>safety</b> <b>rules</b> governing transoceanic flights by aircraft with two engines. Before the 767, overwater flight paths of twinjets could {{be no more than}} 90 minutes away from diversion airports. In May 1985, the FAA granted its first approval for 120-minute ETOPS flights to 767 operators, on an individual airline basis starting with TWA, provided that the operator met flight safety criteria. This allowed the aircraft to fly overseas routes at up to two hours' distance from land. The larger safety margins were permitted because of the improved reliability demonstrated by the twinjet and its turbofan engines. The FAA lengthened the ETOPS time to 180 minutes for CF6-powered 767s in 1989, making the type the first to be certified under the longer duration, and all available engines received approval by 1993. Regulatory approval spurred the expansion of transoceanic 767 flights and boosted the aircraft's sales.|$|E
5|$|On September 7, Paul {{called for}} a vote of no {{confidence}} in United States Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner. Later that month, Paul blocked legislation that would strengthen <b>safety</b> <b>rules</b> {{for oil and gas}} pipelines, because, he stated, the bill was not strong enough. In October, Paul blocked a bill that would provide $36million in benefits for elderly and disabled refugees, saying that he was concerned that it could be used to aid domestic terrorists. This was in response to two alleged terrorists who came to the United States through a refugee program and were receiving welfare benefits when they were arrested in 2011 in Paul's hometown of Bowling Green. Paul lifted his hold on the bill after Democratic leaders promised to hold a Congressional hearing into how individuals are selected for refugee status and request an investigation on how the two suspects were admitted in the country through a refugee program. In June 2012, Paul endorsed Mitt Romney after it became apparent that he would be the Republican nominee for the 2012 presidential election. However, he was later vocal about his disagreements with Romney on a number of policies.|$|E

40|$|Uncertainty {{about future}} spread of {{invasive}} organisms hinders planning of effective response measures. We present a two-stage scenario optimization model {{that accounts for}} uncertainty about the spread of an invader, and determines survey and eradication strategies that minimize the expected program cost subject to a <b>safety</b> <b>rule</b> for eradication success. The <b>safety</b> <b>rule</b> includes a risk standard for the desired probability of eradication in each invasion scenario. Because the risk standard may not be attainable in every scenario, the <b>safety</b> <b>rule</b> defines a minimum proportion of scenarios with successful eradication. We apply the model {{to the problem of}} allocating resources to survey and eradicate the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB, Anoplophora glabripennis) after its discovery in the Greater Toronto Area, Ontario, Canada. We use historical data on ALB spread to generate a set of plausible invasion scenarios that characterizes the uncertainty of the beetle's extent. We use these scenarios in the model to find survey and tree removal strategies that minimize the expected program cost while satisfying the <b>safety</b> <b>rule.</b> We also identify strategies that reduce the risk of very high program costs. Our results reveal two alternative strategies: (i) delimiting surveys and subsequent tree removal based on the surveys' outcomes, or (ii) preventive host tree removal without referring to delimiting surveys. The second strategy is more likely to meet the stated objectives when the capacity to detect an invader is low or the aspirations to eradicate it are high. Our results provide practical guidelines to identify the best management strategy given aspirational targets for eradication and spending...|$|R

40|$|Memory access {{errors are}} {{a major source of}} bugs in {{programs}} written in C. The errors are difficult to find and can lead to runtime failures or even security compromises. Languages such as Java are free from such errors because of their strong type-checking mechanisms. We propose a method to achieve many of the memory safety features in these type-safe languages without changing the C language or rewriting source code. Our approach is based on the <b>safety</b> <b>rule</b> that a memory variable should only be updated by the small set of instructions intended by the programmer. Any deviation from the <b>safety</b> <b>rule</b> is considered a violation. The proposed method is implemented using static program slicing techniques and runtime memory access monitoring. Our method can be used for detecting memory corruption attacks, identifying bugs during software development, and diagnosing memory-related failures post-mortem...|$|R
40|$|There is much {{invested}} in <b>safety</b> <b>rule</b> development, implementation {{and control of}} compliance, but the scientific knowledge about how to modify them is limited. This paper presents results from {{a case study of}} four <b>safety</b> <b>rule</b> modification processes in the Norwegian railway system. The cases modified rules for traffic operation and infrastructure maintenance. The study reveals that the cases applied a strategy given the name “reverse invention”. This strategy diverged from the intention of the cases to apply so called hierarchical and risk based approaches, and took more advantage of existing railway knowledge than these. The cases demonstrated four different ways of using risk analyses in the modification work. Also, they provided arguments for and against different rule principles in different contexts. The processes contributed to a revival of railway knowledge. However, as only written elements are systematically stored in organizational memory this knowledge might be in danger...|$|R
