5|$|Napoleon was {{responsible}} for spreading {{the values of the}} French Revolution to other countries, especially in legal reform and the abolition of <b>serfdom.</b>|$|E
5|$|Roberts became President of the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1946. She was {{influenced}} at university by political {{works such as}} Friedrich Hayek's The Road to <b>Serfdom</b> (1944), which condemned economic intervention by government as a precursor to an authoritarian state.|$|E
5|$|With half {{a million}} burghers in the Commonwealth now {{substantially}} enfranchised, political power became more equally distributed, but little was done about the less politically conscious and active classes, such as the Jews and peasants. Although ArticleIV placed the Commonwealth's peasantry {{under the protection of}} the national lawa first step toward enfranchising the country's largest and most oppressed social classthe low status of the peasantry as compared to other classes was not eliminated, as the constitution did not abolish <b>serfdom.</b> Not until the Second Partition and Kościuszko's Proclamation of Połaniec in 1794 would the Polish government begin to abolish <b>serfdom.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the {{creation}} of the Commonwealth, several new types of military units were introduced. First among these were the registered Cossacks, formed in 1578. These were the troops made up of Cossacks, paid for their service and not subject to <b>serfdom.</b> Their numbers varied from about 500 to many times that number, with the Treaty of Zboriv setting the record at 40,477. The Cossacks' refusal to submit to <b>serfdom,</b> and the Commonwealth's nobility attempts to force them into it led to much political wrangling with regard {{to the size of the}} Cossack register, and to numerous Cossack uprisings, particularly in the 17th century. These weakened the state, and eventually led to the Cossack subjugation and destruction by the Russian Empire. In addition to the Cossack formations, another group that provided notable service to the Polish state were the Tatars, some of whom resided in Lithuania, and were Commonwealth subjects. Known as Lipka Tatars, they provided some light and medium cavalry units for the Lithuanian army.|$|E
5|$|Lukashenko {{announced}} a new law in 2014 that will prohibit kolkhoz workers (around 9% of total work force) from leaving their jobs at will—a change of job and living location will require permission from governors. The law was compared with <b>serfdom</b> by Lukashenko himself. Similar regulations were introduced for the forestry industry in 2012.|$|E
5|$|While {{a medical}} {{resident}} in the 1960s, Paul {{was influenced by}} Friedrich Hayek's The Road to <b>Serfdom,</b> which caused him to read other publications by Ludwig von Mises and Ayn Rand. He came to know economists Hans Sennholz and Murray Rothbard well, and credits to them {{his interest in the}} study of economics.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Napoleon, {{not only was the}} Napoleonic Code {{retained}} by conquered countries including the Netherlands, Belgium, parts of Italy and Germany, but has been used as the basis of certain parts of law outside Europe including the Dominican Republic, the US state of Louisiana and the Canadian province of Quebec. The memory of Napoleon in Poland is favorable, for his support for independence and opposition to Russia, his legal code, the abolition of <b>serfdom,</b> and the introduction of modern middle class bureaucracies.|$|E
5|$|Due to his wartime experiences, Frederick William was {{convinced}} that Brandenburg-Prussia would only prevail with a standing army. Traditionally, raising and financing army reserves was a privilege of the estates, yet Frederick William envisioned a standing army financed independently of the estates. He succeeded in getting the consent and necessary financial contributions of the estates in a landtag decree of 26 July 1653. In turn, he confirmed several privileges of the knights, including tax exemption, assertion of jurisdiction and police powers on their estates (Patrimonialgerichtsbarkeit) and the upholding of <b>serfdom</b> (Leibeigenschaft, Bauernlegen).|$|E
5|$|Russian {{migration}} to the peninsula continued into the 16th century, when new settlements such as Kandalaksha and Porya-Guba were established. Kola was first mentioned in 1565. In {{the end of the}} 15th century, the Pomors and the Sami people were forced into <b>serfdom,</b> mostly by the monasteries. Monastery votchinas greatly expanded during the 17th century, but were abolished in 1764, when all of the Kola Peninsula peasants became state peasants.|$|E
5|$|Since the Ottoman army outnumbered {{the forces}} at Sigismund's disposal, he {{proposed}} the Székely commoners (who {{had been reduced}} to <b>serfdom</b> in the 1560s) to restore their freedom if they joined his campaign against the Ottomans. The Székelys accepted his offer, enabling Sigismund to launch a counter-invasion in Wallachia in early October. The united forces of Transylvania, Wallachia, and Moldavia defeated the retreating Ottoman army in the Battle of Giurgiu on 25October. Although the victory was not decisive, the battle enabled the two voivodes to maintain their alliance with the Holy League.|$|E
5|$|So {{immigrants}} who had newly acquired land were not enfranchised as were not {{most of the}} rural ethnically Polish farmers, who still held land by way of lease or feudal fief only like serfs or vassals of their landlords, unlike Prussia proper where <b>serfdom</b> had been abolished in 1807 and 1810. Immigrant farmers from the Holy Roman Empire (such as the Bambrzy) or later from member states of the German Confederation, had usually remained free peasants, causing their stronger representation within the eight members elected by peasants, {{of a total of}} 48. With regard to ethnicity, most of the nobility representatives were Polish, peasantry representatives were balanced, and the townsfolk representatives were mostly German. The first sejm included 22 Poles and 26 Germans, and most of the subsequent elections produced an almost even split between the Poles and the Germans. A major issue of the Sejm was the abolition of <b>serfdom,</b> which would enlarge the number of Polish speaking landowners and after ten years allow their participation in Sejm elections.|$|E
5|$|The folwark, a {{large-scale}} system of agricultural production based on <b>serfdom,</b> was a dominant feature on Poland's economic landscape {{beginning in the}} late 15th century and for the next 300 years. This dependence on nobility-controlled agriculture in central-eastern Europe diverged from {{the western part of the}} continent, where elements of capitalism and industrialization were developing to a much greater extent, with the attendant growth of a bourgeoisie class and its political influence. The 16th-century agricultural trade boom combined with free or very cheap peasant labor made the folwark economy very profitable.|$|E
5|$|Most {{historical}} {{buildings are}} concentrated in the Old Town. Bratislava's Town Hall is a complex of three buildings erected in the 14th–15th centuries and now hosts the Bratislava City Museum. Michael's Gate is the only gate that has been preserved from the medieval fortifications, and it ranks among {{the oldest of the}} town's buildings; the narrowest house in Europe is nearby. The University Library building, erected in 1756, was used by the Diet of the Kingdom of Hungary from 1802 to 1848. Much of the significant legislation of the Hungarian Reform Era (such as the abolition of <b>serfdom</b> and the foundation of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences) was enacted there.|$|E
5|$|The Land Estates Act of 1908 {{was passed}} by the Madras Government in order to protect {{cultivators}} in Zamindaris from exploitation. Under the act, ryots were made permanent occupants of the land. However, far from protecting the ryots, the legislation proved to be detrimental to the interests of the cultivators in the Oriya-speaking northern districts of the presidency who were the intended beneficiaries, as it tied the cultivator to his land and landlord with the chains of eternal <b>serfdom.</b> In 1933, an amendment to the Act was introduced by the Raja of Bobbili to curb the rights of Zamindars and safeguard the cultivators from exploitation. This act was passed in the legislative council despite strong opposition from the Zamindars.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of agnatic kinship and feudal obligations {{has been seen}} as creating the system of clans in the Highlands in this era. Scottish society adopted theories of the three estates to describe its society and English terminology to differentiate ranks. <b>Serfdom</b> disappeared from the records in the fourteenth century and new social groups of labourers, craftsmen and merchants, became important in the developing burghs. This led to increasing social tensions in urban society, but, in contrast to England and France, {{there was a lack of}} major unrest in Scottish rural society, where there was relatively little economic change.|$|E
5|$|A known {{historical}} {{resident of}} Zaprešić was Count Josip Jelačić of Bužim (1801–59), the Ban of Croatia from 1848 until his death. Although born in Novi Sad, Serbia (then Habsburg Monarchy), {{he received an}} estate in Zaprešić together with his title. He is responsible for abolishing <b>serfdom</b> in Croatia in 1848, but also for an infamous suppression of Croatian intelligentsia, and the Illyrian movement during his reign under the orders of Baron Alexander von Bach, and Emperor Franz Joseph I. A statue of Jelačić riding a horse was constructed by Anton Dominik Fernkorn, and placed on the Zagreb's central square, Ban Jelačić Square. The statue has been repeatedly removed, and reinstated during changes in political power and orientation in Croatia, from monarchist, through ultra-nationalist, and communist, up to democratic. After the Croatian declaration of independence, marking {{the start of the}} democratic era, the statue was returned to the square, and Zaprešić credits Jelačić with a major arterial road named in his honor.|$|E
5|$|Among the Calvinists, {{who also}} {{included}} {{the lower classes}} and their leaders, ministers of common background, disagreements soon developed, based on different views {{in the areas of}} religious and social doctrines. The official split took place in 1562, when two separate churches were officially established: the mainstream Calvinist and the smaller, more reformist, Polish Brethren or Arians. The adherents of the radical wing of the Polish Brethren promoted, often by way of personal example, the ideas of social justice. Many Arians (such as Piotr of Goniądz and Jan Niemojewski) were pacifists opposed to private property, <b>serfdom,</b> state authority and military service; through communal living some had implemented the ideas of shared usage of the land and other property. A major Polish Brethren congregation and center of activities was established in 1569 in Raków near Kielce, and lasted until 1638, when Counter-Reformation had it closed. The notable Sandomierz Agreement of 1570, an act of compromise and cooperation among several Polish Protestant denominations, excluded the Arians, whose more moderate, larger faction {{toward the end of the}} century gained the upper hand within the movement.|$|E
5|$|At {{the centre}} of power, the kings {{employed}} a succession of clergy as chancellors, responsible for running the royal chancery, while the familia regis, the military household, emerged {{to act as a}} bodyguard and military staff. England's bishops continued to form an important part in local administration, alongside the nobility. Henry I and Henry II both implemented significant legal reforms, extending and widening the scope of centralised, royal law; by the 1180s, the basis for the future English common law had largely been established, with a standing law court in Westminster—an early Common Bench—and travelling judges conducting eyres around the country. King John extended the royal role in delivering justice, and the extent of appropriate royal intervention was one of the issues addressed in the Magna Carta of 1215. The emerging legal system reinvigorated the institution of <b>serfdom</b> in the 13th century by drawing an increasingly sharp distinction between freemen and villeins.|$|E
5|$|However {{the series}} of power struggles between the lesser nobility (szlachta), the higher nobility (magnates), and elected kings, {{undermined}} citizenship values and gradually eroded the government's authority, ability to function and provide for national defense. The infamous liberum veto procedure was used to paralyze parliamentary proceedings beginning {{in the second half}} of the 17th century. After {{the series of}} devastating wars in the middle of the 17th century (most notably the Chmielnicki Uprising and the Deluge), Poland-Lithuania stopped being an influential player in the politics of Europe. During the wars the Commonwealth lost an estimated 1/3 of its population (higher losses than during World War II). Its economy and growth were further damaged by the nobility's reliance on agriculture and <b>serfdom,</b> which, combined with the weakness of the urban burgher class, delayed the industrialization of the country.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, the Nehru Commission {{composing}} {{of representatives}} of Indian political parties proposed constitutional reforms for India that apart from calling for dominion status for India and elections under universal suffrage, would guarantee rights deemed fundamental, representation for {{religious and ethnic}} minorities, and limit {{the powers of the}} government. In 1931, the Indian National Congress (the largest Indian political party of the time) adopted resolutions committing itself to the defence of fundamental civil rights, as well as socio-economic rights such as the minimum wage and the abolition of untouchability and <b>serfdom.</b> Committing themselves to socialism in 1936, the Congress leaders took examples from the constitution of the erstwhile USSR, which inspired the fundamental duties of citizens as a means of collective patriotic responsibility for national interests and challenges.|$|E
5|$|In the Greco-Roman {{world of}} Classical antiquity, Roman {{agriculture}} {{was built on}} techniques originally pioneered by the Sumerians, transmitted to them by subsequent cultures, with a specific emphasis on the cultivation of crops for trade and export. The Romans {{laid the groundwork for}} the manorial economic system, involving <b>serfdom,</b> which flourished in the Middle Ages. The farm sizes in Rome can be divided into three categories. Small farms were from 18-88 iugera (one iugerum is equal to about 0.65 acre). Medium-sized farms were from 80-500 iugera (singular iugerum). Large estates (called latifundia) were over 500 iugera. The Romans had four systems of farm management: direct work by owner and his family; slaves doing work under supervision of slave managers; tenant farming or sharecropping in which the owner and a tenant divide up a farm’s produce; and situations in which a farm was leased to a tenant.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by the sermons of {{the radical}} cleric John Ball, and led by Wat Tyler, a {{contingent}} of Kentish rebels advanced on London. They were met at Blackheath by representatives of the royal government, who unsuccessfully attempted to persuade them to return home. King Richard II, then aged 14, retreated {{to the safety of}} the Tower of London, but most of the royal forces were abroad or in northern England. On 13 June, the rebels entered London and, joined by many local townsfolk, attacked the gaols, destroyed the Savoy Palace, set fire to law books and buildings in the Temple, and killed anyone associated with the royal government. The following day, Richard met the rebels at Mile End and acceded to most of their demands, including the abolition of <b>serfdom.</b> Meanwhile, rebels entered the Tower of London, killing the Lord Chancellor and the Lord High Treasurer, whom they found inside.|$|E
5|$|Jewish {{settlement}} {{was taking place}} in Poland since very early times. In 1264, Duke Bolesław the Pious of Greater Poland granted the privileges of the Statute of Kalisz, which specified {{a broad range of}} freedoms of religious practices, movement, and trading for the Jews. It also created a legal precedent for the official protection of Jews from local harassment and exclusion. The act exempted the Jews from enslavement or <b>serfdom</b> and was the foundation of future Jewish prosperity in the Polish kingdom; it was later followed by many other comparable legal pronouncements. Following a series of expulsions of Jews from Western Europe, Jewish communities were established in Kraków, Kalisz and elsewhere in western and southern Poland in the 13th century. Another series of communities were established at Lviv, Brest-Litovsk and Grodno further east in the 14th century. King Casimir received Jewish refugees from Germany in 1349, which assisted the acceleration of a Jewish expansion in Poland that was to continue until World War II. German urban and rural settlements were another long-lasting ethnic feature.|$|E
5|$|Kingship was {{the major}} form of government, growing in sophistication in the late Middle Ages. The scale and nature of war also changed, with larger armies, naval forces and the {{development}} of artillery and fortifications. Christianity introduced monasticism and what has been identified as Celtic Christianity. Nevertheless, the church accepted papal authority and from the eleventh century embraced monastic reform, developing a flourishing religious culture that asserted its independence from English control. Scotland grew from its base in the eastern Lowlands, to approximately its modern borders. The varied and dramatic geography of the land provided a protection against invasion, but limited central control. It also defined the largely pastoral economy, with the first burghs being created from the twelfth century. The population may have grown to a peak of a million before the arrival of the Black Death in 1337. In the early Middle Ages society was divided between a small aristocracy and larger numbers of freemen and slaves. <b>Serfdom</b> disappeared in the fourteenth century and there was a growth of new social groups.|$|E
5|$|Society {{throughout}} Europe {{was disturbed}} by the dislocations caused by the Black Death. Lands that had been marginally productive were abandoned, as the survivors were able to acquire more fertile areas. Although <b>serfdom</b> declined in Western Europe it became more common in Eastern Europe, as landlords imposed it on those of their tenants who had previously been free. Most peasants in Western Europe managed to change the work they had previously owed to their landlords into cash rents. The percentage of serfs amongst the peasantry declined {{from a high of}} 90 to closer to 50 per cent {{by the end of the}} period. Landlords also became more conscious of common interests with other landholders, and they joined together to extort privileges from their governments. Partly at the urging of landlords, governments attempted to legislate a return to the economic conditions that existed before the Black Death. Non-clergy became increasingly literate, and urban populations began to imitate the nobility's interest in chivalry.|$|E
5|$|Staszic was a keen {{observer}} of {{the proceedings of the}} Great Sejm, spending much time in Warsaw since the Sejm began its deliberations in 1788. He continued publishing new books and pamphlets. His Warnings for Poland, coming from the current European politics and natural laws, by the writer of the remarks upon the life of Jan Zamoyski (Przestrogi dla Polski z teraźniejszych politycznych Europy związków i z praw natury wypadające przez pisarza uwag nad życiem Jana Zamoyskiego, 1790), together with his previous Remarks, are considered among the most influential works of the Polish Enlightenment. In Warnings, he criticised the magnates of Poland and Lithuania, monastic orders and <b>serfdom,</b> and supported the enfranchisement of the townsfolk. Although he was not a participant of the Sejm, he was an influential onlooker, and through his widely read and discussed writings of the time is {{recognized as one of the}} founding fathers of the Constitution of May 3, 1791.|$|E
5|$|The Normans and French {{who arrived}} after the conquest saw {{themselves}} as different from the English. They had close family and economic links to the Duchy of Normandy, spoke Norman French and had their own distinctive culture. For many years, to be English was {{to be associated with}} military failure and <b>serfdom.</b> During the 12th century, the divisions between the English and Normans began to dissolve as a result of intermarriage and cohabitation. By the end of the 12th century, and possibly as early as the 1150, contemporary commentators believed the two peoples to be blending, and the loss of the Duchy in 1204 reinforced this trend. The resulting society still prized wider French cultural values, however, and French remained the language of the court, business and international affairs, even if Parisians mocked the English for their poor pronunciation. By the 14th century, however, French was increasingly having to be formally taught, rather than being learnt naturally in the home, although the aristocracy would typically spend many years of their lives in France and remained entirely comfortable working in French.|$|E
5|$|The Novgorod Republic {{lost control}} of the {{peninsula}} to the Grand Duchy of Moscow in 1471, but the Russian migration did not stop. Several new settlements were established during the 16th century, and the Sami and Pomor people were forced into <b>serfdom.</b> In {{the second half of the}} 16th century, the peninsula became a subject of dispute between the Tsardom of Russia and the Kingdom of Denmark–Norway, which resulted in the strengthening of the Russian position. By the end of the 19th century, the indigenous Sami population had been mostly forced north by the Russians as well as by newly arriving Izhma Komi and Kominized Nenets (so-called Yaran people), who migrated here to escape a reindeer disease epidemic in their home lands in the southeast of the White Sea. The original administrative and economic center of the area was Kola, situated at the estuary of the Kola River into the Kola Bay. However, in 1916, Romanov-na-Murmane (now Murmansk) was founded and quickly became the largest city and port on the peninsula.|$|E
5|$|The Ottoman Empire {{demanded a}} total {{liquidation}} of the Cossack power. The Commonwealth, however, needed the Cossacks in the south-east, where they provided an effective buffer against Crimean Tatars incursions. The {{other way to}} quell the Cossack unrest would be to grant the nobility status to {{a substantial portion of}} their population and thus assimilate them into the Commonwealth's power structure, which was what Cossacks aspired to. This solution was being rejected by the magnates and szlachta for political, economic and cultural reasons when there was still time for reform, before disasters struck. The Polish–Lithuanian establishment had instead shifted unsteadily between compromising with the Cossacks, allowing limited varying numbers, the so-called Cossack register (500 in 1582, 8000 in the 1630s), to serve with the Commonwealth army (the rest were to be converted into <b>serfdom,</b> to help the magnates in colonizing the Dnieper area), and brutally using military force in an attempt to subdue them.|$|E
5|$|The Peasants' Revolt, {{also called}} Wat Tyler's Rebellion or the Great Rising, {{was a major}} {{uprising}} across large parts of England in 1381. The revolt had various causes, including the socio-economic and political tensions generated by the Black Death in the 1340s, the high taxes resulting from the conflict with France during the Hundred Years' War, and instability within the local leadership of London. The final trigger for the revolt was the intervention of a royal official, John Bampton, in Essex on 30 May 1381. His attempts to collect unpaid poll taxes in Brentwood ended in a violent confrontation, which rapidly spread across the south-east of the country. A wide spectrum of rural society, including many local artisans and village officials, rose up in protest, burning court records and opening the local gaols. The rebels sought a reduction in taxation, {{an end to the}} system of unfree labour known as <b>serfdom</b> and the removal of the King's senior officials and law courts.|$|E
5|$|The Sejm's great {{achievement}} was {{the adoption of}} the Constitution of May 3, 1791, often described as Europe's first modern written national constitution, and the world's second, after the United States Constitution. The Polish Constitution was designed to redress long-standing political defects of the federative Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and its system of Golden Liberties. The Constitution introduced political equality between townspeople and nobility and placed the peasants under the protection of the government, thus mitigating the worst abuses of <b>serfdom.</b> The Constitution abolished pernicious parliamentary institutions such as the liberum veto, which at one time had placed a sejm at the mercy of any deputy who might choose, or be bribed by an interest or foreign power, to undo all the legislation that had been passed by that sejm. The May 3rd Constitution sought to supplant the existing anarchy fostered by some of the country's reactionary magnates, with a more egalitarian and democratic constitutional monarchy.|$|E
5|$|The {{constitution}} {{sought to}} supplant the prevailing anarchy fostered {{by some of}} the country's magnates with a more democratic constitutional monarchy. It introduced elements of political equality between townspeople and nobility, and placed the peasants under the protection of the government, thus mitigating the worst abuses of <b>serfdom.</b> It banned parliamentary institutions such as the liberum veto, which had put the Sejm at the mercy of any deputy who could revoke all the legislation that had been passed by that Sejm. The Commonwealth's neighbours reacted with hostility to the adoption of the constitution. Frederick William II's Kingdom of Prussia broke its alliance with the Commonwealth, which was attacked and then defeated in the War in Defence of the Constitution by an alliance between Catherine the Great's Imperial Russia and the Targowica Confederation of anti-reform Polish magnates and landless nobility. The King, a principal co-author, eventually capitulated to the Confederates.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} England in the Middle Ages, from the Norman {{invasion}} in 1066, {{to the death}} of HenryVII in 1509, was fundamentally agricultural, though even before the invasion the market economy was important to producers. Norman institutions, including <b>serfdom,</b> were superimposed on an existing system of open fields and mature, well-established towns involved in international trade. Over the next five centuries the economy would at first grow and then suffer an acute crisis, resulting in significant political and economic change. Despite economic dislocation in urban and extraction economies, including shifts in the holders of wealth and the location of these economies, the economic output of towns and mines developed and intensified over the period. By the end of the period, England had a weak government, by later standards, overseeing an economy dominated by rented farms controlled by gentry, and a thriving community of indigenous English merchants and corporations.|$|E
5|$|Whereas {{the poll}} tax of 1381 was the spark of the Peasants' Revolt, {{the root of}} the {{conflict}} lay in tensions between peasants and landowners precipitated by the economic and demographic consequences of the Black Death and subsequent outbreaks of the plague. The rebellion started in Kent and Essex in late May, and on 12 June, bands of peasants gathered at Blackheath near London under the leaders Wat Tyler, John Ball and Jack Straw. John of Gaunt's Savoy Palace was burnt down. The Archbishop of Canterbury Simon Sudbury, who was also Lord Chancellor, and the king's Lord High Treasurer, Robert Hales, were both killed by the rebels, who were demanding the complete abolition of <b>serfdom.</b> The king, sheltered within the Tower of London with his councillors, agreed that the Crown did not have the forces to disperse the rebels and that the only feasible option was to negotiate.|$|E
5|$|Alliance {{with his}} father-in-law, Władysław I the Elbow-high, King of Poland, became a {{permanent}} element of Charles's {{foreign policy in}} the 1320s. After being defeated by the united forces of the Teutonic Knights and John of Bohemia, WładysławI sent his son and heir, Casimir, to Visegrád in late 1329 to seek assistance from Charles. During his stay in Charles's court, the nineteen-year-old Casimir seduced Claire Záh, who was a lady-in-waiting of Charles's wife, Elisabeth of Poland, according to an Italian writer. On 17April 1330, the young lady's father, Felician Záh, stormed into the dining room of the royal palace at Visegrád with a sword in his hand and attacked the royal family. Záh wounded both Charles and the queen on their right hand and attempted to kill their two sons, Louis and Andrew, before the royal guards killed him. Charles's revenge was brutal: with the exception of Claire, Felician Záh's children were tortured to death; Claire's lips and all eight fingers were cut before she was dragged by a horse through the streets of many towns; all of Felician's other relatives within the third degree of kinship (including his sons-in-law and sisters) were executed, and those within the seventh degree were condemned to perpetual <b>serfdom.</b>|$|E
5|$|From {{the twelfth}} century there are sources that allow the {{stratification}} in society {{to be seen in}} detail, with layers including the king and a small elite of mormaers above lesser ranks of freemen and what was probably a large group of serfs, particularly in central Scotland. In this period the feudalism introduced under David I meant that baronial lordships began to overlay this system, the English terms earl and thane became widespread. Below the noble ranks were husbandmen with small farms and growing numbers of cottars and gresemen (grazing tenants) with more modest landholdings. The combination of agnatic kinship and feudal obligations has been seen as creating the system of clans in the Highlands in this era. Scottish society adopted theories of the three estates to describe its society and English terminology to differentiate ranks. <b>Serfdom</b> disappeared from the records in the fourteenth century and new social groups of labourers, craftsmen and merchants, became important in the developing burghs. This led to increasing social tensions in urban society, but, in contrast to England and France, {{there was a lack of}} major unrest in Scottish rural society, where there was relatively little economic change.|$|E
