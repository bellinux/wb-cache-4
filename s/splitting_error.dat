It is, for example, standard practice in computational air pollution modelling where we encounter systems of three-dimensional, time-dependent partial differential equations of the advection–diffusion–reaction type. For such systems {{little attention has been}} devoted to the analysis of splitting and to the question why splitting can work so well. From the theoretical point of view, the success of splitting is primarily determined by the <b>splitting</b> <b>error.</b> This paper presents an analysis of operator splitting aimed at providing insight into the <b>splitting</b> <b>error.</b> Using the Lie operator formalism, a general expression is derived for a three-term Strang splitting in the pure initial value case. For a class of advection–diffusion–reaction problems the <b>splitting</b> <b>error</b> is analyzed in greater detail.

40|$|An {{efficient}} modification by Douglas and Kim of {{the usual}} alternating directions method reduces the <b>splitting</b> <b>error</b> from O(k 2) to O(k 3) in time step k. We prove conver-gence of this modified alternating directions procedure, for the usual non-mixed Galerkin finite element and finite difference cases, under the restriction that k/h 2 is sufficiently small, where h is the grid spacing. This improves the results of Douglas and Gunn, who require k/h 4 to be sufficiently small, and Douglas and Kim, who require that the locally one-dimensional operators commute. We propose a similar and efficient modification of alternating directions for mixed finite element methods that reduces the <b>splitting</b> <b>error</b> to O(k 3), and we prove convergence in the noncommuting case, provided that k/h 2 is sufficiently small. Numerical computations illustrating the mixed finite element results are also presented.

For example, the order of spatial accuracy of the algorithms proposed in [Qiu and Christlieb, J. Comp. Phys., 2010] is very high (as high as ninth order). However, the temporal error {{is dominated by the}} operator <b>splitting</b> <b>error,</b> which is second order for Strang splitting. It is therefore important to overcome such low order <b>splitting</b> <b>error,</b> in order to have numerical algorithms that achieve higher orders of accuracy in both space and time. In this paper, we propose to use the integral deferred correction (IDC) method to reduce the <b>splitting</b> <b>error.</b> Specifically, the temporal order accuracy is increased by r with each correction loop in the IDC framework, where r= 1, 2 for coupling the first order splitting and the Strang splitting, respectively. The proposed algorithm is applied to the Vlasov-Poisson system, the guiding center model, and two dimensional incompressible flow simulations in the vorticity stream-function formulation. We show numerically that the IDC procedure can automatically increase the order of accuracy in time.

The paper first reviews <b>splitting</b> and stabilization <b>errors</b> that appear in many common approximate projection methods. The approximate pressure projection analysis demonstates a conflicted role for the pressure stabilization scaling parameter. This parameter must be chosen to control both <b>splitting</b> <b>errors</b> and stabilization errors. However, for fully coupled schemes <b>splitting</b> <b>errors</b> are not of consequence. Therefore, a stabilization parameter can be chosen to most appropriately control stabilization errors. A fully coupled equal-order scheme is proposed with two forms of the stabilization parameter.

In order to decrease {{the size of this}} <b>splitting</b> <b>error</b> to O(τ^ 3), we add a correction term to the right-hand side of the original formulation. This procedure is based on the improved initialization technique proposed by Douglas and Kim in the framework of ADI methods.

The classical analysis of the <b>splitting</b> <b>error</b> may then fail, since the chosen splitting timestep Δt is in practice much larger than the fastest time scales: the asymptotic expansion Δt→ 0 is therefore no longer valid. We show here that singular perturbation theory provides an interesting framework for the study of <b>splitting</b> <b>error.</b> Some new results concerning the order of local errors are derived. The main result deals with the choice of the sequential order for the operators: the stiff operator must always be last in the splitting scheme...|$|E

Error terms in popular models of reward learning (such as the temporal difference [TD] model) do not distinguish between the updating of expectations in response to reward cues and outcomes.

40|$|To do homological algebra with {{unbounded}} chain complexes {{one needs}} to first {{find a way of}} constructing resolutions. Spaltenstein solved this problem for chain complexes of R-modules by truncating further and further to the left, resolving the pieces, and gluing back the partial resolutions. Our aim is to give a homotopy theoretical interpretation of this procedure, which may be extended to a relative setting. We work in an arbitrary abelian category A and fix a class I of "injective objects". We show that Spaltenstein's construction can be captured by a pair of adjoint functors between unbounded chain complexes and towers of non-positively graded ones. This pair of adjoint functors forms what we call a Quillen pair and the above process of truncations, partial resolutions, and gluing, gives a meaningful way to resolve complexes in a relative setting up to a <b>split</b> <b>error</b> term. In order to do homotopy theory, and in particular to construct a well behaved relative derived category D(A; I), we need more: the <b>split</b> <b>error</b> term must vanish.

40|$|Distributed {{hydrological}} {{models have}} been used for decades to calculate and predict the movement of water and energy within watersheds. These models have evolved from relatively simple empirical applications into complex spatially distributed and physically-based programs. However, the evolution of distributed hydrological models has not involved the improvement of the numerical methods used to calculate the redistribution of water and energy in the watershed. Because of this, many models still use numerical methods that are potentially inaccurate. In order to simulate the transport of water and energy in a hydrological model, typical numerical methods employ an operator splitting approach. Operator splitting (OS) essentially breaks down the set of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that define a hydrological model into separate ODEs that can be solved individually. The dominant operator splitting method in surface water models is the ordered series approach. Because the ordered series approach treats parallel hydrological processes as if they happen in series, it is prone to errors that can significantly reduce the accuracy of model results. The impact that operator <b>splitting</b> <b>errors</b> have upon hydrologic model results is, to date, unknown. Using a new distributed hydrological model, Raven, the impact of operator <b>splitting</b> <b>errors</b> is investigated. Understanding these errors will lead to better numerical methods for reducing errors in models and to shed light on the shortcomings of hydrological models with respect to numerical method choice.

In this paper we test another classical second order splitting introduced by Strang in 1963, which, unlike the popular Strang splitting, seemed to be forgotten and rediscovered recently (partially due to its intrin-sic parallellism). This splitting, called symmetrically weighted sequential (SWS) splitting, is simple and straightforward to apply, independent of the order of the operators and has an operator-level parallelism.
