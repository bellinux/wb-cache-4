50|$|At age two Prairie Bayou won a maiden {{race and}} an {{allowance}} race. He {{went on to}} place second in his next two starts in stakes races. He finished as the runner-up in both the Inner Harbor Stakes and the Pappa Riccio Stakes. As a three-year-old he really began to show promise. He won the Count Fleet Stakes and the Whirlaway Stakes at Aqueduct {{in the first quarter}} of 1993. In March Prairie Bayou won the <b>Spriral</b> Stakes at Turfway Park. In April he won the grade one Blue Grass Stakes at Keeneland Race Course. Leading up to the 1993 Kentucky Derby, Prairie Bayou was made the betting favorite for the Derby, as well as for the other two Triple Crown races, Prairie Bayou was ridden by jockey Mike Smith. A come-from-behind horse, in the Derby he was caught far back in the large field for most of the race. In the final quarter, the gelding had to move to the far outside in order to make a strong stretch run that earned him a second-place finish behind Sea Hero.|$|E
40|$|Recent advancements in imaging {{technology}} enable the noninvasive assessment of atherosclerotic plaques in arteries throughout the body. High-resolution multisclice computed tomography (MSCT) - {{sometimes referred to}} as multidetector <b>spriral</b> or just MDCT - and cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) provide information about the arterial wall that is unavailable with the most other methods, including angiography. Moreover, MSCT and MR are making great strides in the characterizatuion of plaque composition and microanatomy, thus leading to the identification of lesions that are vulnerable to rupture or erosion. This information may aid in the selection of patients most likely to benefit from early intervention, including lipid-lowering drug regimens. There would be considerable advantage, too, in developing a noninvasive means of detecting coronary artery stenosis. Until now, QCA has been invaluable for detecting stenosis while ultrafast computed tomography (CT) and cardiac MR have shown promise for showing details of the plaques that are detected. However, 16 -slice CT and three-dimensionalm, navigator-directed MR have been proposed for the noninvasive detection of coronary artery stenosis...|$|E
