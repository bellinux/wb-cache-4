40|$|Private searching on {{streaming}} data {{is a process}} to dispatch to a public server a program, which searches streaming sources of data without revealing <b>searching</b> <b>criteria</b> and then sends back a buffer containing the findings. From an Abelian group homomorphic encryption, the <b>searching</b> <b>criteria</b> can be constructed by only simple combinations of keywords, e. g., disjunction of keywords. The recent breakthrough in fully homomorphic encryption has allowed us to construct arbitrary <b>searching</b> <b>criteria</b> theoretically. In this paper, we consider a (t, n) threshold query, which searches for documents containing more than t out of n keywords. This form of query can help us find more relevant documents. We present a construction of the <b>searching</b> <b>criteria</b> for private threshold searching on {{streaming data}} {{on the basis of}} the state-of-the-art fully homomorphic encryption techniques. Our protocol is semantically secure as long as the underlying fully homomorphic encryption scheme is semantically secure...|$|R

In the Abu Ghraib photograph, for example, the search engine was given the names of top officials, civilian contractors and enlisted soldiers cited in the ‘Final Report of the Independent Panel to Review DoD Detention Operations’...." [...] His intent was to [...] "make an ironic criticism" [...] of beliefs that people on the Internet [...] "shar an exhaustive, universal, and democratic conscience." [...] Reviews of works in the series were mixed. In 2007, the Simon Wiesenthal Center objected to a Googlegram showing the wall in the Palestinian West Bank that was a mosaic of photographs of Nazi concentration camps, stating that it was [...] "a smug exercise in banalizing the horrors of the Holocaust."

40|$|Prior to {{clinical}} use, pharmacogenetic tests should be systematically evaluated for their clinical validity and utility. Here, we evaluated whether the publicly available, online Pharmacogenomics Knowledge Base (PharmGKB) could facilitate such assessments by efficiently identifying relevant peer-reviewed manuscripts. The search targets were 55 manuscripts regarding clinical validity and utility included in systematic reviews of warfarin, antidepressant, and irinotecan pharmacogenetics. When direct inclusion in PharmGKB was the <b>search</b> <b>criterion,</b> recall was 33 % and precision was 16 %. However, recall increased to 78 % when citation within a PharmGKB-identified manuscript was added as a <b>search</b> <b>criterion.</b> These recalled manuscripts accounted for 87 % {{of the study}} subjects, and domain experts determined that the omission of the remaining manuscripts was unlikely to have changed the conclusions of the reviews.

We employed combined data of several instruments of the Rosetta Plasma Consortium (RPC) to identify and study diamagnetic cavity crossing events. Using electron data from the Ion Electron Sensor (IES) to complement the Magnetometer (MAG) data enabled us {{to work out a}} <b>search</b> <b>criterion</b> for the cavity crossing events based on a unique signature we identified in the electron spectrum. Although this <b>search</b> <b>criterion</b> is insufficient to find all the cavity events, we were able to find an abundance of more than one hundred cavity crossings in the data obtained in the summer of 2015. This unexpectedly high number of events allowed us to study their common features, as well as the shape and extent of the diamagnetic cavity in the terminator plane. The results suggest that in the summer of 2015 there was a cavity around comet 67 P, which had a highly variable outer boundary. We present the effects of the diamagnetic cavity on the thermal and suprathermal electron and suprathermal ion content of the plasma, and also the probable mechanisms responsible for these charged particle signatures...|$|R
