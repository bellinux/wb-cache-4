40|$|The embryo {{transfer}} technology which offers rapid exploitation of genetic potential of superior female {{has not been}} standardized in the Indian dromedary. Preliminary trials were conducted for developing {{embryo transfer}} technology in Indian camels. The donor she camels were examined by ultrasound {{for the presence of}} dominant follicle in ovaries. Various protocols were attempted for superovulation. The two-way long Foley’s catheter (26 ”, 18 Fr, 30 C>C.) was used for embryo flushing. The air bulb of catheter was fixed just inside the uterine body to flush both horns simultaneously. DPBS (1. 5 - 2 litres) was used for flushing in about 12 to 14 releases. The media recovered was filtered through EmCon filter and filtrate was searched under <b>stereozoom</b> <b>microscope</b> for embryos. A total of seven embryos were collected out of eight superovulatory treatments. One good quality morula was transferred in recipient...|$|E
30|$|Depending on {{the size}} of the sample, either the entire sample or aliquots of the {{zooplankton}} were used for enumeration. Generally, the entire samples from depths below 200 m were counted, while from the near-surface layers, they were split with a Folsom splitter to ≤ 50 % and used for the analysis. Under a <b>stereozoom</b> <b>microscope</b> (Olympus, Japan, × 90), the animals were sorted from the original samples and identified into different taxonomic groups using standard identification keys (UNESCO 1968). Detailed taxonomic examination of the copepod species (Kasturirangan 1963; Tanaka 1956) was done from station WB 2 to WB 4 and expressed as individuals per cubic meter (ind./m 3) of water filtered. The marine Species Identification Portal ([URL] the Integrated Taxonomic Information System online database ([URL] and the World Register of Marine Species ([URL] were used to aid in the identification of copepod species.|$|E
40|$|Statement of Problem: The {{goal of a}} {{successful}} endodontic surgery is to establish an adequate seal in apical region. Therefore during surgery, root-end resection is essential for an appropriate situation and proper access. "nPurpose: The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the most appropriate root-end resection angle to establish adequate apical seal in periapical surgery,"nMaterials and Methods: Forty-five intact extracted human maxillary central incisors were randomly divided into three 15 -tooth groups. The root canals were instrumented and then obturated using lateral condensation technique. AM roots were resected at 3 mm from apical portion. Angles of root resection for each group were 0, 30 and 45 degrees. Then all teeth surfaces, except the cut ones, were covered with nail polish and immersed in methylen blue for 7 days. After 7 days, nail polish was removed from the surfaces and samples were split in buccolingual direction. Then, dye penetration (mm) was measured using a <b>stereozoom</b> <b>microscope</b> (Loupe) [X 4 magnification] and eye lens. In order to analyze the data, unilateral variance analysis was used. "nResults: The values of dye penetration were: 7. 23 &plusmn; 3. 34 (0 &deg;), 8. 46 &plusmn; 3. 01 (30 &deg;) and 9. 74 &plusmn; 4. 11 (45 &deg;). There"nwas no significant difference between three groups (P&gt; 0. 05). Conclusion: It is suggested that the angle of root-end resection put a limited effect on apical seal if retrograde cavity depth is increased...|$|E
30|$|Specimens of H. fossilis {{which range}} from 40 to 80 [*]g for male and from 80 to 120 [*]g for female were {{collected}} {{during the month of}} June (early spawning phase) from the ponds around Alwarkurichi, Tamil Nadu (8 ° 48 ′ 00 ″N; 77 ° 27 ′ 30 ″E). On arrival to the laboratory, the fish were disinfected with formalin (50 [*]ppm) for 2 [*]h to remove external parasites. Mature female brood fish were primarily {{selected on the basis of}} a soft and bulging belly, which yielded continuous ova of uniform size on gentle stripping. Then, these eggs were examined under a <b>stereozoom</b> <b>microscope</b> to check its maturity. These selected fish were stocked in a polyvinyl chloride tank (3 [*]×[*] 2 [*]×[*] 1 [*]m) with continuous aeration, normal photoperiod (13.5 -h[*]L: 10.5 -h D), and an ambient water temperature (26 [*]±[*] 2 °C) to induce final ovulation. The induction of final maturation and ovulation was stimulated using a single intramuscular injection of Ovaprim marketed by GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Limited (Mumbai, India), each milliliter contains salmon gonadotropin-releasing hormone of 20 mcg and Domperidone of 10 mcg at the rates of 0.3 and 0.5 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 body weights for males and females, respectively. The gametes were collected separately 10 [*]h after Ovaprim injection at an ambient water temperature of 26 [*]±[*] 1 °C (Godwin et al. [2009]); gently pressing the abdomen towards the anus yields a copious stream of transparent greenish brown eggs. These eggs were collected in a glass bowl previously rinsed with Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS).|$|E
40|$|Introduction The primary aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{precision}} of root canal length determination on cone-beam computed tomographic (CBCT) scans and periapical radiographs (PAs) with the actual root canal length. The secondary aim was to examine the influence of tooth type on root canal length measurements as assessed on CBCT scans and PAs. Methods In total, 40 root canals of 33 teeth (molars, premolars, canines, and incisors) out of 5 dentate maxillas of human cadavers were included. Root canal length measurement was performed by a consensus panel (2 examiners) on CBCT scans (3 D Accuitomo 170; J Morita, Kyoto, Japan) and digital PAs. After straight-line access opening, a # 15 file was fixated in every root canal at the length measured on CBCT scans. All teeth were extracted, and the root canal containing the file was uncovered. Measurements made on images taken with a digital camera (AxioCam; Carl Zeiss, Sliedrecht, The Netherlands) linked to a <b>stereozoom</b> <b>microscope</b> (Stemi SV 6, Carl Zeiss) were used as the actual root canal length. Results When all roots were examined together, it was not clear which method is better for all types of teeth. For root canals of anterior teeth, there was no significant difference between the 2 methods. For root canals of posterior teeth, CBCT images gave results significantly closer to the actual root canal length in comparison with PAs (t value = − 1. 96; critical value is 1. 74 with a significance level of 0. 05). Conclusions Root canal length measurements of posterior maxillary teeth were more accurate when assessed by CBCT images than PAs...|$|E
