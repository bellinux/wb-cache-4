2500|$|Sodium thiopental, {{also known}} as Sodium Pentothal (a {{trademark}} of Abbott Laboratories, {{not to be confused}} with pentobarbital), thiopental, thiopentone, or Trapanal (also a trademark), is a rapid-onset <b>short-acting</b> <b>barbiturate</b> general anesthetic that is an analogue of thiobarbital. [...] Sodium thiopental was a core medicine in the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, which is a list of minimum medical needs for a basic healthcare system, but was supplanted by propofol. Despite this thiopental is still listed as an acceptable alternative to propofol, depending on local availability and cost of these agents. It was previously the first of three drugs administered during most lethal injections in the United States, but the U.S. manufacturer Hospira stopped manufacturing the drug and the EU banned the export of the drug for this purpose.|$|E

25|$|Drug users tend {{to prefer}} <b>short-acting</b> and intermediate-acting <b>barbiturates.</b> The most {{commonly}} used are amobarbital (Amytal), pentobarbital (Nembutal), and secobarbital (Seconal). A combination of amobarbital and secobarbital (called Tuinal) is also highly used. <b>Short-acting</b> and intermediate-acting <b>barbiturates</b> are usually prescribed as sedatives and sleeping pills. These pills begin acting fifteen to forty minutes after they are swallowed, and their effects last from five to six hours.|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} {{a method for}} measuring pentobarbital in samples that also contain phenobarbital. The phenobar-bital is destroyed by adding sodium hydroxide and then heating at 95 #{ 176 }Cfor 60 mm. Pentobarbital is not affected by this pretreatment and can then be measured with an Abbott TDx barbiturates kit. Using this method, we ob-tained an average analytical recovery of 98 % of added pentobarbital and a correlation of y = O. 953 x + 3. 4 vs HPLC. The intra-assay CV was 3. 7 % at 25. 8 mg/L; the interassay CV was 6. 2 % at 16. 1 mg/L Other long-acting barbiturates, e. g., hexobarbital, are also effectively de-stroyed by this alkali pretreatment.

40|$|The {{sodium salt}} of N-methyl-cyclohexenyl-methyl-malonyl urea (evipal) {{is one of the}} most {{interesting}} of the newer barbituric acid compounds. While it exhibits a rapid and high hypnotic coefficient and a very short duration of action, its toxicity, provided that it is properly administered, is considerably lower than that of the so-called <b>short-acting</b> <b>barbiturates,</b> e. g., nem butal, pernocton, and amytal. In these respects evipal bears closer resemblance to diethylepoxy-propionamide, diethylepoxy methylpropionamide and other epoxy amides being elaborated by Fourneau, Billeter and Bovet (1) than it does to the better known and more widely employed barbiturates. The enormous amount of literature appearing in recent months indicates that evipal has gained considerable popularity as a gen eral anesthetic in surgical procedures of short duration. This popularity is due to its wide margin of safety, speed of induction, good relaxation, minimal disturbance of circulation, short dura tion and negligible after-effects. However, very little work has been reported from the laboratories. Because of this paucity of basic data we deemed it expedient to subject this new barbiturate to certain pharmacological tests. The present report is limited to data obtained in studies of the hypnotic, the anesthetic, and the toxic action of evipal on rats and rabbits. TECHNIQUE With the exception of one series of 10 rats, treated subcu taneously for the purpose of determining the differential absor...|$|R

40|$|Reviewed in {{this paper}} are modern {{approaches}} in the intensive therapy of acute hypoxic encephalopathy developing {{in a number of}} occasions after the heart valve replacement surgery. The study is {{based on the results of}} neurological, neuropsychological and neurophysiological (EEG) examinations of 240 patients who underwent heart valve replacement surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass conditions complicated later by the development of hypoxic encephalopathies of varying severity and who received complex intensive care. Relying on many years of experience in the treatment of heart surgery patients in whom manifestations of encephalopathy developed in the early postoperative period, or were delayed, we have formulated the following algorithms of therapy. (1) Maintenance of normal blood gas: Hb> 100 g/L, pH 7. 45, PaCO 2 35 mmHg. (2) Maintenance of hemodynamics: ABPsystolic> 90 mmHg. (3) Supplying fluids and electrolytes: isoosmolar infusion solutions, adding of KCl and MgSO 4 to the infusion. (4) Antiedemic therapy: 15 % mannitol or 40 % glycerol solution. (5) If necessary (in case of psychomotor agitation, seizures), <b>short-acting</b> <b>barbiturates</b> (sodium thiopental), neuroleptics (haloperidol), propofol. No benzodiazepines in case of psychoses (6) Cerebral metabolism stimulation (not earlier than 48 hours after surgery) with cholinomimetics, nootropics, cerebral blood flow protectors. Cholinomimetics are allowed on the first day after surgery. This algorithm and the above-mentioned groups of drugs, especially central cholinomimetics, allow for correcting the neurocognitive impairment in the discussed group of patients quickly and effectively...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of <b>short-acting</b> <b>barbiturates,</b> it has been tacitly assumed that these compounds are very rapidly destroyed in the body. Their brief duration of action, their rapid disap-pearance from the tissues, {{and the failure to}} detect these com-pounds except in small amounts in the urine following their administration all point to this conclusion. Pratt (1) and Pratt et al. (2) found that in animals poisoned with phosphorus, carbon tetrachloride, or exposed to chloroform anesthesia for two hours a significant delay in the disappearance of bromsulphalein from the blood occurred, indicating liver damage. The duration of action of pentobarbital in such animals was greatly prolonged. They also reported that the duration of action of barbital was not modffied in animals with experimental liver damage, and concluded that {{this is due to the}} fact that barbital is a very stable compound in vivo, that it is not changed by the liver, but that approximately 85 per cent of the dose of barbital is excreted by the kidneys during a period of several days. Koppanyi et al. (3) reported experiments in which they pro-duced liver damage in mammals by chloroform anesthesia of two hours duration and found that the duration of action of subse-quently administered pentobarbital was greatly prolonged. The results also indicated that in these animals pentobarbital dis-appeared from the tissues less rapidly than from those of the con-trols. They did not use barbital in these experiments...|$|R

40|$|The {{complications}} {{encountered in}} caring for 185 patients intoxicated with barbiturates were reviewed. The population consisted of 142 patients with long-acting barbiturate concentrations of 8 mg per 100 ml or greater, 20 patients with <b>short-acting</b> <b>barbiturate</b> concentrations of 3 mg per 100 ml or greater and 23 consecutive patients with <b>short-acting</b> <b>barbiturate</b> intoxication referred for monitoring. Pneumonia was the major cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} and correlated best with the initial depth of coma and the use of an endotracheal tube in treatment. Cardiovascular instability manifested by pulmonary edema was the next leading cause of morbidity and mortality and correlated best with the initial depth of coma and the quantity of intravenous fluid administered. In retrospect, use of eliminative measures such as dialysis would probably not have altered the outcome in most of the patients who died and attempts at forced diuresis may have contributed to several deaths. Particular emphasis should be placed on the problems of sepsis and fluid therapy in the management of these patients...|$|E

40|$|Peak flow {{acceleration}} {{measured in}} the common carotid artery was compared with peak flow acceleration {{measured in the}} ascending aorta of five chronically instrumented dogs. Electromagnetic flow sensors, myocardial electrocardiographic leads, right atrial catheters, and coronary occluders were implanted through an incision of the chest at the fourth intercostal space and a ventral midline incision of the neck under sterile conditions while the dogs were anesthetized with sodium pentoharbital. Experiments began 10 days after surgery. We investigated the response to exercise, to 60 -second occlusions of the circumflex branch, the anterior descending branch, or both branches of the left coronary artery, to induction of <b>short-acting</b> <b>barbiturate</b> anesthesia, and to intravenous infusion of three concentrations each of isoproterenol (0. 8, 1. 5 - 3. 0, and 4. 0 fig/min), l-norepinephrine (0. 8, 2. 0, and 4. 0 /xg/min), and acetylcholine (0. 3 - 0. 5, 0. 8 - 2. 0, and 4. 0 mg/ min).

40|$|Pentobarbitone sodium (Sodium 5 -ethyl- 5 [1 -methylbutyl]-pentobarbitone) is a <b>short-acting</b> <b>barbiturate</b> that is {{commonly}} used to euthanase animals. As part of our studies into the molecular genetics of copper toxicosis in Bedlington terrier dogs, reverse-transcription (RT) -PCR was noted to always fail on RNA samples collected from livers of dogs sacrificed by pentobarbitone injection. When samples were collected without pentobarbitone, however, RTPCR was always successful. We suspected the possible inhibition by pentobarbitone sodium of either reverse transcriptase or Taq polymerase. In vitro studies showed that pentobarbitone interference of PCR occurred at > 4 mug/mul. To identify if pentobarbitone produced competitive inhibition, each components (Taq polymerase, MgCl 2, dNTP, etc.) of the PCR was individually altered. However, inhibition still persisted, suggesting that multiple PCR components may be affected. Also it was shown that pentobarbitone interference was not dependent on the PCR product size. Simple dilution of pentobarbitone contaminated DNA solutions, {{and the addition of}} bovine serum albumin (BSA) to the PCR mix overcame pentobarbitone interference. In vivo, PCR by pentobarbitone was found to be compounded by high DNA concentration and pentobarbitone contamination. In addition, both high DNA concentration and pentobarbitone contamination could be overcome through dilution and the addition of BSA. Further work is required to quantify pentobarbitone concentration in the liver-extracted DNA and RNA samples before this inhibition effect on PCR can be fully elucidated. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V.

In infants (n= 30) born at 35. 4 weeks gestation (range 27. 9 - 42. 0) undergoing surgery at a median postnatal age of 24. 5 h (range 4 - 521), repeated blood levels were assessed after administering a dose of 3 mg/kg thiopentone on clinical indication before intubation (seven samples per infant from 5 min to 48 h after administration). Results The umbilical/maternal concentration ratio was 0. 7, the mean concentration of thiopentone was 55. 7 micromol/l (SD+/- 15. 3) in mothers and 39. 3 micromol/l (SD+/- 12. 5) in venous cord blood. In newborn infants undergoing surgery, the terminal half-life of thiopentone was 8 h (interquartile range (IQR) 2. 5 - 10. 8), and clearance 0. 092 l/min per kg/postnatal age in days (IQR 0. 02 - 0. 1). Conclusions Thiopentone might be used as premedication for short-lasting intubation after birth, for example, for surfactant administration.
