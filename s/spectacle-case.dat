60|$|Mr. Miller {{inspected}} the message, felt for his <b>spectacle-case,</b> found it, opened it, {{took out his}} glasses, replaced the <b>spectacle-case,</b> felt for his handkerchief, polished the glasses, replaced the handkerchief, put the glasses on, and read. A blank look came into his face.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't stand there, Doyce, {{turning your}} <b>spectacle-case</b> over and over,' cried Mr Meagles, 'but tell Mr Clennam what you confessed to me.' ...|$|E
60|$|He took one; {{and drawing}} a <b>spectacle-case</b> from his pocket, leisurely {{pulled out a}} pair of spectacles, which he {{adjusted}} on his nose.|$|E
6000|$|There was an {{audience}} of sixty-four in Lecture-room A--earnest girl students bringing out note-books and <b>spectacle-cases,</b> frivolous girls feeling their back hair, and the men settling down with a [...] "Come, let's get it over!" [...] air, or glowing up worshipingly, like Eugene Field Linderbeck, or determined not to miss anything, like Carl--the captious college audience, credulous as to statements of fact and heavily unresponsive to the spirit. Professor Frazer, younger than {{half a dozen of}} the plow-trained undergraduates, thin of hair and sensitive of face, sitting before them, with one hand in his pocket and the other nervously tapping the small reading-table, spoke quietly: ...|$|R
60|$|Guy {{put it down}} at once, and Philip {{proceeded}} to improved methods of farming, to enable landlords to meet the exigencies of the times. Guy had got hold of Mr. Edmonstone's <b>spectacle-case,</b> and was putting its spring to a hard trial. Mrs. Edmonstone doubted whether to interfere again; she knew {{this was not the}} sort of thing that tried his temper, yet she particularly disliked playing him off, as it were for Philip's amusement, and quite as much letting him go on, and lower himself in her nephew's estimation. The <b>spectacle-case</b> settled the matter--a crack was heard, it refused to snap at all; and Guy, much discomfited, made many apologies.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The <b>spectacle-case</b> forestalled me {{in giving}} you a lecture on sparing our nerves. Don't look so very full of compunction--it is only a trick which your mother would have stopped at five years old, and which you can soon stop for yourself.' ...|$|E
6000|$|With {{that he put}} up his <b>spectacle-case,</b> {{and said}} to Arthur, 'If I don't complain, Mr Clennam, I can feel gratitude; and I assure you that I feel it towards our mutual friend. Many's the day, and many's {{the way in which}} he has backed me.' ...|$|E
60|$|Bayliss took a <b>spectacle-case</b> {{from the}} {{recesses}} of his costume, opened it, took {{out a pair of}} gold-rimmed glasses, dived into the jungle again, came out with a handkerchief, polished the spectacles, put them on his nose, closed the case, restored it to its original position, replaced the handkerchief, and took up the paper.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Carter paid no {{attention}} to him whatsoever. She drew a <b>spectacle-case</b> from her small hand-bag and set upon her beetling nose a huge pair of horn-rimmed eye-glasses. She picked up the menu-card as though she were delicately removing a bug--supposing there to be any bug so presumptuous as to crawl upon her smart tan suit. She raised her chin and held the card high.|$|E
6000|$|The black frock-coat, emphasising his {{points with}} his <b>spectacle-case,</b> is telling his friends how the parish was first {{the unit of}} self-government. He then {{explains}} how burgesses were elected, and in tones of deep fervour announces, [...] "Commissioners of Sewers are elected in the same way." [...] Whereunto all this lecture? Is he trying to run a motion through under cover of a cloud of words, essaying the well-known [...] "cuttle-fish trick" [...] of the West? ...|$|E
60|$|He was {{not much}} to look at, either in point of size or in point of dress; being merely a short, square, {{practical}} looking man, whose hair had turned grey, and in whose face and forehead there were deep lines of cogitation, which looked {{as though they were}} carved in hard wood. He was dressed in decent black, a little rusty, and had the appearance of a sagacious master in some handicraft. He had a <b>spectacle-case</b> in his hand, which he turned over and over while he was thus in question, with a certain free use of the thumb that is never seen but in a hand accustomed to tools.|$|E
60|$|To make {{assurance}} doubly sure, Mrs Bowater {{pulled down}} the blinds at every stopping-place. We admired the scenery. We read the warning against pickpockets, and I translated {{it out of the}} French. After examining the enormous hotels depicted in the advertisements, we agreed there was nothing like home comforts. Mrs Bowater continued to lose and find in turn our tickets, her purse, her <b>spectacle-case,</b> her cambric pocket-handkerchief, not to mention a mysterious little screw of paper, containing lozenges I think. She scrutinized our luxury with grim determination. And we giggled like two school-girls as we peeped together through the crevices of the blinded windows at the rich, furry passengers who ever and again hurried along, casting angry glances at our shrouded windows.|$|E
60|$|When {{the breakfast}} was cleared away; the merry old gentlman {{and the two}} boys played at a very curious and {{uncommon}} game, which was performed in this way. The merry old gentleman, placing a snuff-box in one pocket of his trousers, a note-case in the other, and a watch in his waistcoat pocket, with a guard-chain round his neck, and sticking a mock diamond pin in his shirt: buttoned his coat tight round him, and putting his <b>spectacle-case</b> and handkerchief in his pockets, trotted {{up and down the}} room with a stick, in imitation of the manner in which old gentlemen walk about the streets any hour in the day. Sometimes he stopped at the fire-place, and sometimes at the door, making believe that he was staring with all his might into shop-windows. At such times, he would look constantly round him, for fear of thieves, and would keep slapping all his pockets in turn, to see that he hadn't lost anything, in such a very funny and natural manner, that Oliver laughed till the tears ran down his face. All this time, the two boys followed him closely about: getting out of his sight, so nimbly, every time he turned round, {{that it was impossible to}} follow their motions. At last, the Dodger trod upon his toes, or ran upon his boot accidently, while Charley Bates stumbled up against him behind; and in that one moment they took from him, with the most extraordinary rapidity, snuff-box, note-case, watch-guard, chain, shirt-pin, pocket-handkerchief, even the <b>spectacle-case.</b> If the old gentlman felt a hand in any one of his pockets, he cried out where it was; and then the game began all over again.|$|E
6000|$|... 'We will do our best, of course, {{if those}} are your instructions. Then, {{that is all}} except'--here Midmore half rose, but Mr. Sperrit's little grey eyes held his large brown ones firmly--'except about Rhoda Dolbie, Mrs. Werf's maid. I may {{tell you that we}} did not draw up your aunt's last will. She grew secretive towards the last--elderly people often do--and had it done in London. I expect her memory failed her, or she mislaid her notes. She used to put them in her <b>spectacle-case....</b> My motor only takes eight minutes to get to the station, Mr. Midmore ... but, as I was saying, {{whenever}} she made her will with us, Mrs. Werf always left Rhoda thirty pounds per annum. Charlie, the wills!' A clerk with a baldish head and a long nose dealt documents on to the table like cards, and breathed heavily behind Midmore. 'It's in no sense a legal obligation, of course,' said Mr. Sperrit. 'Ah, that one is dated January the 11th, eighteen eighty-nine.' ...|$|E
60|$|Not {{a little}} {{relieved}} by the discovery, our adventurer paused, more particularly to survey so deceptive an object, {{which seemed to}} have been constructed on the most efficient principles; probably by some broken down wax figure costumer. It comprised the complete wardrobe of a scarecrow, namely: a cocked hat, bunged; tattered coat; old velveteen breeches; and long worsted stockings, full of holes; all stuffed very nicely with straw, and skeletoned by a frame-work of poles. There was a great flapped pocket to the coat--which {{seemed to have been}} some laborer's--standing invitingly opened. Putting his hands in, Israel drew out the lid of an old tobacco-box, the broken bowl of a pipe, two rusty nails, and a few kernels of wheat. This reminded him of the Squire's pockets. Trying them, he produced a handsome handkerchief, a <b>spectacle-case,</b> with a purse containing some silver and gold, amounting to a little more than five pounds. Such is the difference between the contents of the pockets of scarecrows and the pockets of well-to-do squires. Ere donning his present habiliments, Israel had not omitted to withdraw his own money from his own coat, {{and put it in the}} pocket of his own waistcoat, which he had not exchanged.|$|E
6000|$|She {{observed}} also, {{more accurately}} {{than she had}} ever done before, that he always carried the key of his desk with him. He did not, indeed, put it under his pillow, or conceal it in bed, but he placed it with an old <b>spectacle-case</b> which he always carried, and a little worn pocket-book which Nina knew to be empty, on a low table which stood at his bed-head; and now during the whole of the afternoon he had the key on the table beside him. Nina did not doubt but that she could take the key while he was asleep; for when he was even half asleep--which was perhaps his most customary state--he would not stir when she entered the room. But if she took it at all, she would do so in the day. She could not bring herself to creep into the room in the night, and to steal the key in the dark. As she lay in bed she still thought of it. She had promised her lover that she would do this thing. Should she resolve not to do it, in spite of that promise, she must at any rate tell Anton of her resolution. She must tell him, and then there would be an end of everything. Would it be possible for her to live without her love? ...|$|E
60|$|The grand moral {{question}} now came up, {{what to do}} with the purse. Would it be dishonest under the circumstances to appropriate that purse? Considering the whole matter, and not forgetting that he had not received from the gentleman deceased the promised reward for his services as courier, Israel concluded that he might justly use the money for his own. To which opinion surely no charitable judge will demur. Besides, what should he do with the purse, if not use it for his own? It would have been insane to have returned it to the relations. Such mysterious honesty would have but resulted in his arrest as a rebel, or rascal. As for the Squire's clothes, handkerchief, and <b>spectacle-case,</b> they must be put out of sight with all dispatch. So, going to a morass not remote, Israel sunk them deep down, and heaped tufts of the rank sod upon them. Then returning to the field of corn, sat down under the lee of a rock, about a hundred yards from where the scarecrow had stood, thinking which way he now had best direct his steps. But his late ramble coming after so long a deprivation of rest, soon produced effects not so easy to be shaken off, as when reposing upon the haycock. He felt less anxious too, since changing his apparel. So before he was aware, he fell into deep sleep.|$|E
60|$|Then how can {{a clumsy}} male wit attempt the {{arrangement}} of all the chiffonerie, by which old snuff-boxes, heads of canes, pomander boxes, lamer beads, and all the trash usually found in the pigeon-holes of the bureaus of old-fashioned ladies, may be now brought into play, by throwing them, carelessly grouped with other unconsidered trifles, such as are {{to be seen in}} the windows of a pawnbroker's shop, upon a marble encognure, or a mosaic work-table, thereby turning to advantage the trash and trinketry, which all the old maids or magpies, who have inhabited the mansion for a century, have contrived to accumulate. With what admiration of the ingenuity of the fair artist have I sometimes pried into these miscellaneous groups of pseudo-bijouterie, and seen the great grandsire's thumb-ring couchant with the coral and bells of the first-born--and the boatswain's whistle of some old naval uncle, or his silver tobacco-box, redolent of Oroonoko, happily grouped with the mother's ivory comb-case, still odorous of musk, and with some virgin aunt's tortoise-shell <b>spectacle-case,</b> and the eagle's talon of ebony, with which, in the days of long and stiff stays, our grandmothers were wont to alleviate any little irritation in their back or shoulders! Then there was the silver strainer, on which, in more economical times than ours, the lady of the house placed the tea-leaves, after the very last drop had been exhausted, that they might afterwards be hospitably divided among the company, to be eaten with sugar, and with bread and butter. Blessings upon a fashion which has rescued from the claws of abigails, and the melting-pot of the silversmith, those neglected cimelia, for the benefit of antiquaries and the decoration of side-tables! But who shall presume to place them there, unless under the direction of female taste? and of that Mr. Mowbray, though possessed of a large stock of such treasures, was for the present entirely deprived.|$|E
