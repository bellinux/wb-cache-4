40|$|Seasonal {{changes in}} home range size and habitat {{selection}} of kakapo (<b>Strigops</b> <b>habroptilus)</b> were investigated on Maud Island. Kakapo were radio-tracked {{at night in}} each of the four seasons between December 2000 and October 2001. Home ranges were estimated for four adult males, three juvenile males and two juvenile females in each season and for nine females in summer, each based on 20 radio-fixes per season. Home range size varied from 1. 8 to 145. 0 ha using the minimum convex polygon method. Home ranges were smallest in winter. Habitat selection was determined by overlaying the kakapo locations and home ranges on a vegetation map of the island. For each season selection ratios were calculated for each vegetation community. Pine plantation (Pinus radiata) was selected for in summer, whereas the treeland community dominated by five-finger (Pseudopanax arbereus) was selected for in the autumn.

40|$|Good phylogenetic {{trees are}} {{required}} to test hypotheses about evolutionary processes. We report four new avian mitochondrial genomes, which together with an improved method of phylogenetic analysis for vertebrate mt genomes give results for three questions in avian evolution. The new mt genomes are: magpie goose (Anseranas semipalmata), an owl (morepork, Ninox novaeseelandiae); a basal passerine (rifleman, or New Zealand wren, Acanthisitta chloris); and a parrot (kakapo or owl-parrot, <b>Strigops</b> <b>habroptilus).</b> The magpie goose provides an important new calibration point for avian evolution because the well-studied Presbyornis fossils are on the lineage to ducks and geese, after {{the separation of the}} magpie goose. We find, as with other animal mitochondrial genomes, that RY-coding is helpful in adjusting for biases between pyrimidines and between purines. When RY-coding is used at third positions of the codon, the root occurs between paleognath and neognath birds (as expected from morphological and nuclear data). In addition, passerines form a relatively old group in Neoaves, and many modern avian lineages diverged during the Cretaceous. Although many aspects of the avian tree are stable, additional taxon sampling is required. ...|$|R
40|$|Summary: The {{diet and}} feeding methods of kakapo (<b>Strigops</b> <b>habroptilus)</b> on Stewart Island, {{southern}} New Zealand, were studied by examining sign {{left by the}} birds. Most feeding sign was found on herbs, ferns, and shrubs, especially on new and developing growth such as leaves, bark, fruits and seeds, {{as well as the}} subterranean portions. The species on which most kakapo sign was found were Lycopodium ramulosum, L. fastigiatum, Schizaea fistulosa var. australis, Blechnum minus, B. procerum, Cyathodes juniperina, Dracophyllum longifolium, Olea ria wlensoi, Thelymitra venosa, Oreobolus strictus, Gahnia procera and Carex appressa. Though all (but Oreobolus and Gahnia) were fed on frequently throughout the year, variations in the use of different parts of plants occurred both seasonally and annually. The nature of the feeding sign indicated that kakapo are versatile feeders with highly variable feeding patterns, and many foods are taken opportunistically. This flexible feeding pattern allows kakapo to utilise a broad spectrum of seasonal foods which may only be available for short periods or on intermittent years...|$|R
40|$|Telomere {{dynamics}} are intensively {{studied in}} human ageing research and epidemiology, with many correlations reported between telomere length and age-related diseases, cancer and death. While telomere length {{is influenced by}} environmental factors there is also good evidence for a strong heritable component. In human, the mode of telomere length inheritance appears to be paternal and telomere length differs between sexes, with females having longer telomeres than males. Genetic factors, e. g. sex chromosomal inactivation, and non-genetic factors, e. g. antioxidant properties of oestrogen, have been suggested as possible explanations for these sex-specific telomere inheritance and telomere length differences. To test the influence of sex chromosomes on telomere length, we investigated inheritance and sex-specificity of telomere length in a bird species, the kakapo (<b>Strigops</b> <b>habroptilus),</b> in which females are the heterogametic sex (ZW) and males are the homogametic (ZZ) sex. We found that, contrary to findings in humans, telomere length was maternally inherited and also longer in males. These results argue against an effect of sex hormones on telomere length and suggest that factors associated with heterogamy {{may play a role}} in telomere inheritance and sex-specific differences in telomere length...|$|R
40|$|Secondary flightlessness {{has evolved}} {{independently}} {{many times in}} birds. Morphological changes in the pectoral girdle and flight feathers and changes in body size {{have been associated with}} the evolution of flightlessness, and it has also been suggested that flightless birds have relatively small brains. We therefore tested whether flightlessness is related to changes in relative brain size. Relative brain size was compared between volant and flightless species using both conventional statistics and modem comparative methods within nine taxonomic groups. No significant difference was found between flightless and volant species in six of these groups, regardless of whether body mass or tibiotarsal measurements were used as estimates of body size. Species with relatively smaller brains compared with their volant relatives were the great auk Pinguinus impennis, the kakapo <b>Strigops</b> <b>habroptilus</b> and some species of penguin. Thus, we found no evidence of a general correlation between the evolution of secondary flightlessness and the evolution of relatively small brains in birds. This suggests that neural requirements are not significantly different between flightless and volant species, although our methods may have overlooked subtle neurological changes that do not result in markedly different endocranial volumes.

40|$|Abstract Background In vertebrates, the {{molecular}} {{basis of the}} sense of smell is encoded by members of a large gene family, namely olfactory receptor (OR) genes. Both the total number of OR genes and the proportion of intact OR genes in a genome may indicate the importance {{of the sense of}} smell for an animal. There is behavioral, physiological, and anatomical evidence that some bird species, in particular nocturnal birds, have a well developed sense of smell. Therefore, we hypothesized that nocturnal birds with good olfactory abilities have evolved (i) more OR genes and (ii) more intact OR genes than closely related and presumably less 'olfaction-dependent' day-active avian taxa. Results We used both non-radioactive Southern hybridization and PCR with degenerate primers to investigate whether two nocturnal bird species that are known to rely on olfactory cues, the brown kiwi (Apteryx australis) and the kakapo (<b>Strigops</b> <b>habroptilus),</b> have evolved a larger OR gene repertoire than their day-active, closest living relatives (for kiwi the emu Dromaius novaehollandiae, rhea Rhea americana, and ostrich Struthio camelus and for kakapo the kaka Nestor meridionalis and kea Nestor notabilis). We show that the nocturnal birds did not have a significantly higher proportion of intact OR genes. However, the estimated total number of OR genes was larger in the two nocturnal birds than in their relatives. Conclusion Our results suggest that ecological niche adaptations such as daily activity patterns may have shaped avian OR gene repertoires. </p...|$|R
40|$|Ultraviolet (UV) light-transmitted signals play a {{major role}} in avian {{foraging}} and communication, subserving functional roles in feeding, mate choice, egg recognition, and nestling discrimination. Sequencing functionally relevant regions of the short wavelength sensitive type 1 (SWS 1) opsin gene that is responsible for modulating the extent of SWS 1 UV sensitivity in birds allows predictions to be made about the visual system's UV sensitivity in species where direct physiological or behavioral measures would be impractical or unethical. Here, we present SWS 1 segment sequence data from representative species of three avian lineages for which visually based cues for foraging and communication have been investigated to varying extents. We also present a preliminary phylogenetic analysis and ancestral character state reconstructions of key spectral tuning sites along the SWS 1 opsin based on our sequence data. The results suggest ubiquitous ultraviolet SWS 1 sensitivity (UVS) in both paleognaths, including extinct moa (Emeidae), and parrots, including the nocturnal and flightless kakapo (<b>Strigops</b> <b>habroptilus),</b> and in most, but not all, songbird (oscine) lineages, and confirmed violet sensitivity (VS) in two suboscine families. Passerine hosts of avian brood parasites were included both UVS and VS taxa, but sensitivity did not co-vary with egg rejection behaviors. The results should stimulate future research into the functional parallels between the roles of visual signals and the genetic basis of visual sensitivity in birds and other taxa. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|Island {{endemic species}} are often {{vulnerable}} to decline and extinction following human settlement, and the genetic study of historical museum specimens {{can be useful}} in understanding these processes. The kākāpō (<b>Strigops</b> <b>habroptilus)</b> is a critically endangered New Zealand parrot that was formerly widespread and abundant. It is well established that both Polynesian and European colonization of New Zealand impacted the native avifauna, but the timeframe and severity of impacts have differed depending on species. Here, we investigated the relative importance of the 2 waves of human settlement on kākāpō decline, using microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to characterize recent kākāpō genetic and demographic history. We analyzed samples from 49 contemporary individuals and 54 museum specimens dating from 1884 to 1985. Genetic diversity decreased significantly between historical and contemporary kākāpō, with a decline in mean number of microsatellite alleles from 6. 15 to 3. 08 and in number of mtDNA haplotypes from 17 to 3. Modeling of demographic history indicated a recent population bottleneck linked to the period of European colonization (approximately 5 generations ago) but did not support a major decline linked to Polynesian settlement. Effective population size estimates were also larger for historical than contemporary kākāpō. Our findings inform contemporary kākāpō management by indicating the timeframe and possible cause of the bottleneck, which has implications for the management of extant genetic diversity. We demonstrate the broader utility of a historical perspective in understanding causes of decline and managing extinction risk in contemporary endangered species...|$|R
40|$|The takahe (Porphyrio hochstetteri) is {{a highly}} {{endangered}} flightless rail, endemic to New Zealand. Since 1984, a total of 24 takahe have been translocated from a small, alpine population of approximately 120 in Fiordland and successfully established on four predator-free lowland islands with introduced pasture grasslands. However, island takahe produce fewer juveniles per egg due to hatching failure being {{twice as high as}} it is in the natural population in Fiordland. A comparison among several small, inbred populations of New Zealand birds indicated those that are the result of translocations to new habitat types (takahe and kakapo <b>Strigops</b> <b>habroptilus),</b> suered much higher rates of egg infertility than birds that have remained within their natural habitat range. For takahe, whether breeders had been translocated as juveniles or had been raised on the islands was a poor predictor of repro-ductive success. The coecient of inbreeding was high for island takahe but high infertility and low juvenile productivity were features of breeding pairs whether parents were related or not. However, this result might be expected if takahe were already inbred before they were translocated to the islands. If high egg infertility is a consequence of an inbred population being translocated to a new or dierent habitat, then poor breeding success is something that managers may have to live with in the short term until there is local selection for better breeders. In more general terms, the results of the study have implications for the successful translocatio...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that positive selection, in particular selection favoring a change in the protein sequence, plays a role in the evolution of olfactory receptor (OR) gene repertoires in fish and mammals. ORs are 7 -transmembrane domain (TM) proteins, members of the G-protein–coupled receptor superfamily in vertebrate genomes, and responsible for odorant binding and discrimination. OR gene repertoires in birds are surprisingly large and diverse, suggesting that birds have a keen olfactory sense. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate signatures of positive selection in an expanded OR clade (group-c-c) that seems to be a characteristic of avian genomes. Using maximum-likelihood methods that estimate the dN/dS ratios and account for the effects of recombination, we show here that there is evidence for positive selection in group-c-c partial OR coding sequences of 9 bird species that are likely to have different olfactory abilities: the blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus), the black coucal (Centropus grillii), the brown kiwi (Apteryx australis), the canary (Serinus canaria), the galah (Eolophus roseicapillus), the kakapo (<b>Strigops</b> <b>habroptilus),</b> the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), the red jungle fowl (Gallus gallus), and the snow petrel (Pagodroma nivea). Positively selected codons were predominantly located in TMs, which in other vertebrates are involved in odorant binding. Our data suggest that 1) at least some avian OR genes have been subjected to adaptive evolution, 2) the extent of such adaptive evolution differs between bird species, and 3) positive selective pressures may have been stronger on the group-c-c OR genes of species that have well-developed olfactory abilities...|$|R
40|$|Species {{living in}} {{unpredictable}} habitats cannot {{prepare for a}} regular reproductive year, and must reproduce when conditions are favourable. The timing of reproduction of the seed predators involves anticipating an abundant food supply by tracking cues or triggers which initiate reproduction. These cues are poorly understood. The most supported theory is that a cue or cues is the size or abundance of the developing fruit crop, and possibly involves nutritional compounds in the crop. The rimu (Dacrydium cupressinum) is a masting podocarp tree strongly linked to reproduction in kakapo (<b>Strigops</b> <b>habroptilus).</b> On Codfish Island kakapo only breed in rimu mast years and nesting is timed so chicks hatch when the rimu fruit crop (the sole food source for chicks) is due to ripen. This thesis investigates the theory that some component in unripe rimu fruit is involved in timing of nesting in <b>kakapo.</b> <b>I</b> characterised seasonal changes (over one year) in nutritional components (gross nutrients), polyphenolic compounds and other potential target polyphenolic substances with possible hormonal activity, including isoflavones and antioxidants, during rimu fruit development. A number of the compounds found in rimu fruit are known to affect reproduction in other species and could be potential triggers for reproduction in kakapo. In non-mast years insufficient fruit is available to trigger reproduction {{and there is no}} breeding, supporting the idea that the abundance of the fruit crop is also involved in the timing of reproduction. The trigger for breeding in these birds could be ingestion of a threshold level of a trigger substance or substances, or, as in the antbird, it could be entirely visual. The most likely contenders for the trigger in green rimu fruit include increasing levels of crude protein, crude fat, individual fatty acids, dietary fibre (changing the digestibility of other nutrients), calcium, phosphorus, calcium, total polyphenolic content and antioxidant levels, some flavenoids or a combination of these. It is possible that the physiological changes necessary for reproduction are triggered by the abundance of the unripe fruit crop but that nesting itself is triggered by changes in the green, undeveloped fruit associated with ripening...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{why some}} mature females of New Zealand's critically endangered parrot, the kakapo (<b>Strigops</b> <b>habroptilus),</b> {{did not attempt}} to breed during the 2005 breeding season on Codfish Island. At a population level, the initiation of kakapo breeding appears to correspond with years of mast fruiting of rimu (Dacrydium cupressinum) trees, with the proportion of females that breed each season dependent on the quantity of rimu fruit available. This research investigates possible links between habitat quality within individual home ranges and the breeding status of adult females during 2005, when the abundance of available rimu fruit was low. We assessed the importance of both home range size and habitat characteristics in determining breeding attempts. Foraging home ranges were characterised using radio-tracking and triangulation techniques. The relative importance of habitat variables in optimal breeding habitat was assessed using ecological niche factor analysis. Our results show that female kakapo breeding in 2005 had, on average, home ranges twice the size of those females that did not breed that season and the ranges contained a significantly greater quantity of mature rimu forest. Multivariate analysis illustrates female kakapo were effectively partitioning available habitat, as breeders' foraging locations were positively correlated with high-abundance rimu forest with a tall canopy, described as optimal breeding habitat. In contrast non-breeders' locations were weakly correlated with short forest containing little or no mature rimu forest. To maximise reproductive output each breeding season, conservation managers need to ensure that all breeding-aged females occupy optimal breeding habitat on Codfish Island. Removal to other islands of kakapo not required in the breeding population may enable females to increase their home range size and occupy better breeding habitat. © New Zealand Ecological Society...|$|R
40|$|The natural diet of the kakapo (<b>Strigops</b> <b>habroptilus)</b> is {{exclusively}} herbivorous. The bird breeds synchronously {{with the}} heavy fruiting or "masting" of certain plant species, including rimu (Dacrydium cupressinum), at intervals of 2 - 5 years, and did so in 2002 on Codfish Island (Whenua Hou) in southern New Zealand. Crop contents of kakapo chicks of 10 - 30 and 31 - 43 days of age, and samples of rimu fruit (entire fruit, red aril, green aril and seed) were collected and chemically analysed for dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, fatty acids, amino acids, fibre, simple sugars and minerals. The crop content samples contained predominantly carbohydrates (76 - 81 % by dry wt.), crude protein (7 - 13 %) and fatty acids (6 - 7 %). Entire rimu fruit contained 7. 2 % crude protein, 10. 9 % fatty acids, and 78 % carbohydrate predominantly of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. The red aril, green aril and seed nutrient composition were similar {{with the exception of}} the seed fatty acid profile. There was a large degree of similarity in the nutritional composition of the entire rimu fruit and the crop contents, supporting field observations of the time that female kakapo were feeding almost exclusively entire rimu fruit to their chicks. The nutrient profiles provide the first detailed descriptions of the diet of growing kakapo chicks which can guide the development of supplements and artificial rearing diets for this species. The diet of kakapo chicks up to 60 days of age appears to have a low concentration of essential nutrients and high indigestible matter content when compared with other species, consistent with specialised anatomical features and foraging behaviour of this parro...|$|R
40|$|The kakapo (<b>Strigops</b> <b>habroptilus)</b> is an {{endangered}} parrot endemic to New Zealand and {{little is known}} of its reproductive physiology. Reproductive function is conventionally determined by the measurement of reproductive steroids in plasma samples. This is impractical and invasive in endangered, free-living species. However, the measurement of reproductive steroids in avian faecal samples is practiced. Few studies have documented strong relationships between faecal and plasma steroid concentrations. The objectives {{of this study were}} to develop and validate a faecal extraction method for the measurement of oestradiol, progesterone and testosterone in Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica); determine the relationships between steroid concentrations and gonadal development in quail; and define annual faecal hormone cycles of kakapo in relation to their breeding status. Groups of male and female quail were held on different photoperiodic and temperature regimes to produce birds with a range of gonad sizes and steroid concentrations. Steroid concentrations were measured in faeces and plasma by radioimmunoassay. Positive relationships were demonstrated between plasma and faecal steroid concentrations. Faecal steroid concentrations had strong positive relationships with ovary and testis size in female and male quail respectively. The extraction method developed was then applied to faecal samples, which were collected from kakapo in their free-living environment on Whenua Hou (Codfish Island). The samples were collected from identified birds over three potential breeding seasons. There were annual cycles of hormone concentrations that corresponded with cycles of breeding activity in females and males. No {{significant differences were found between}} breeding and non-breeding years for faecal concentrations of all three hormones, suggesting that kakapo undergo a degree of gonadal development each year. Annual hormone profiles for individual birds supported this finding.

40|$|Spores of the dung-fungi Sporormiella are {{routinely}} {{used as a}} proxy for past megaherbivore biomass and to pinpoint the timing of extinctions. Further ecological insight can also be gained into the impacts that followed initial human arrival in a region through correlation of spore abundance with other proxies (e. g. pollen, charcoal). Currently, the use of Sporormiella as a palaeoecological proxy has been restricted to landmasses where large-herbivore guilds are dominated by mammals. Here, we use New Zealand as a case study to show that the method can also be applied effectively to islands dominated by large avian herbivores. We examine 44 dung samples from 7 localities to show that Sporormiella spores were widely distributed in the dung of endemic avian herbivores (South Island takahe (Porphyrio hochstetteri), kakapo (<b>Strigops</b> <b>habroptilus),</b> and several species of extinct moa, identified by ancient DNA analysis). In addition, we show that Sporormiella spores in a forest soil core from the Murchison Mountains, South Island, accurately trace the post-settlement decline of native avian herbivores, and combined with high-resolution radiocarbon dating reveal severely reduced local herbivore populations by the late 17 th Century AD. The spores also trace the subsequent spread of Red deer (Cervus elaphus) introduced to the area in the early 20 th Century AD. Our results suggest Sporormiella spores may provide a useful new tool for examining extinctions on numerous islands where terrestrial herbivore guilds were dominated by birds or reptiles. Our findings also highlight the need to consider entire herbivore communities (including birds and reptiles) when examining Late Pleistocene continental Sporormiella records, where the focus has often been tracing the decline of populations of large mammals.

Within birds, most {{studies have focused on}} differences in the visual system across all birds with respect to nocturnality-diurnality. The critically endangered Kakapo (<b>Strigops</b> <b>habroptilus),</b> a parrot endemic to New Zealand, {{is an example of a}} species that has evolved a nocturnal lifestyle in an otherwise diurnal lineage, but nothing is known about its’ visual system. Here, we provide a detailed morphological analysis of the orbits, brain, eye, and retina of the Kakapo and comparisons with other birds. Morphometric analyses revealed that the Kakapo’s orbits are significantly more convergent than other parrots, suggesting an increased binocular overlap in the visual field. The Kakapo exhibits an eye shape that is consistent with other nocturnal birds, including owls and nightjars, but is also within the range of the diurnal parrots. With respect to the brain, the Kakapo has a significantly smaller optic nerve and tectofugal visual pathway. Specifically, the optic tectum, nucleus rotundus and entopallium were significantly reduced in relative size compared to other parrots. There was no apparent reduction to the thalamofugal visual pathway. Finally, the retinal morphology of the Kakapo is similar to that of both diurnal and nocturnal birds, suggesting a retina that is specialised for a crepuscular niche. Overall, this suggests that the Kakapo has enhanced light sensitivity, poor visual acuity and a larger binocular field than other parrots. We conclude that the Kakapo possesses a visual system unlike that of either strictly nocturnal or diurnal birds and therefore does not adhere to the traditional view of the evolution of nocturnality in birds.

40|$|Late Quaternary extinctions and {{population}} fragmentations have severely disrupted animal-plant interactions globally. Detection of disrupted interactions often relies on anachronistic plant characteristics, such as spines {{in the absence}} of large herbivores or large fruit without dispersers. However, obvious anachronisms are relatively uncommon, and {{it can be difficult to}} prove a direct link between the anachronism and a particular faunal taxon. Analysis of coprolites (fossil feces) provides a novel way of exposing lost interactions between animals (depositors) and consumed organisms. We analyzed ancient DNA to show that a coprolite from the South Island of New Zealand was deposited by the rare and threatened kakapo (<b>Strigops</b> <b>habroptilus),</b> a large, nocturnal, flightless parrot. When we analyzed the pollen and spore content of the coprolite, we found pollen from the cryptic root-parasite Dactylanthus taylorii. The relatively high abundance (8. 9 % of total pollen and spores) of this zoophilous pollen type in the coprolite supports the hypothesis of a former direct feeding interaction between kakapo and D. taylorii. The ranges of both species have contracted substantially since human settlement, and their present distributions no longer overlap. Currently, the lesser short-tailed bat (Mystacina tuberculata) is the only known native pollinator of D. taylorii, but our finding raises the possibility that birds, and other small fauna, could have once fed on and pollinated the plant. If confirmed, through experimental work and observations, this finding may inform conservation of the plant. For example, it may be possible to translocate D. taylorii to predator-free offshore islands that lack bats but have thriving populations of endemic nectar-feeding birds. The study of coprolites of rare or extinct taxonomic groups provides a unique way forward to expand existing knowledge of lost plant and animal interactions and to identify pollination and dispersal syndromes. This approach of linking paleobiology with neoecology offers significant untapped potential to help inform conservation and restoration plans. Jamie R. Wood, Janet M. Wilmshurst, Trevor H.

40|$|Introduced {{mammalian}} {{predators and}} anthropogenic habitat modification {{have resulted in}} the loss of 62 avian species since humans arrived in New Zealand. The conservation paradigm for New Zealand relies upon predator free, ecologically intact or restored islands to serve as sanctuaries and breeding sites for a range of threatened species. Island breeding programs and translocations to restore native fauna to the mainland and other off-shore sites, introduce specific risks related to disease spread. Beak and Feather Disease Vims (BFDV), was found in clinically affected juvenile Red Crowned Parakeet (RCP, Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae) on Hautum Island in 2008. This finding had major implications for conservation management of parrots in New Zealand, including the critically endangered kakapo (<b>Strigops</b> <b>habroptilus)</b> and orange fronted parakeet (Cyanoramphus malherbi). Feather loss had also been reported in RCP on nearby Tiritiri Matangi Island, suspected to be caused by BFDV. BFDV is endemic in the exotic Eastern rosella (Platycercus eximius) and Sulphur-crested cockatoo (Cacatua galerita) on the North Island of New Zealand. A spill over event likely spread the vims to RCP on nearby islands in the Hauraki Gulf of the Auckland region. Four cross-sectional surveys were conducted between 201 1 - 2012 on Tiritiri Matangi Island to determine the presence, prevalence and seasonal trends of key diseases of parrots that may result in feather loss. A total of 184 birds were captured in mist nets. All birds were anaesthetised to collect samples of blood, feathers and faeces, and in 2012 a skin biopsy from the head was included. Individuals were examined for general condition including stages of moult and body weight, and morphometrics and standardised photos were obtained. Hippoboscid flies were collected opportunistically when observed on birds. Blood and feather samples were tested for BFDV by PCR, and a subset of samples was tested for the presence of antibodies to BFDV using the haemagglutination inhibition test.

5000|$|The {{main reasons}} for the {{extinction}} of the passenger pigeon were the massive scale of hunting, the rapid loss of habitat, and the extremely social lifestyle of the bird, which made it highly vulnerable to the former factors. Deforestation was driven {{by the need to}} free land for agriculture and expanding towns, but also due to the demand for lumber and fuel. About 728,000 km2 (180 million acres) were cleared for farming between 1850 and 1910. Though there are still large woodland areas in eastern North America, which support a variety of wildlife, it was not enough to support the vast number of passenger pigeons needed to sustain the population. In contrast, very small populations of nearly extinct birds, such as the kakapo (<b>Strigops</b> <b>habroptilus)</b> and the takahē (Porphyrio hochstetteri), have been enough to keep those species extant to the present. The combined effects of intense hunting and deforestation has been referred to as a [...] "Blitzkrieg" [...] against the passenger pigeon, and it has been labeled one of the greatest and most senseless human-induced extinctions in history. As the flocks dwindled in size, the passenger pigeon population decreased below the threshold necessary to propagate the species.The 2014 study that demonstrated natural fluctuations in population numbers prior to human arrival also showed that the species routinely recovered from lows in the population, and suggested that one of these lows may have coincided with the intensified exploitation by humans in the 1800s, a combination which would have led to the rapid extinction of the species. A similar scenario may also explain the rapid extinction of the Rocky Mountain locust (Melanoplus spretus) during the same period. It has also been suggested that after the population was thinned out, it would be harder for few or solitary birds to locate suitable feeding areas. In addition to the birds killed or driven away by hunting during breeding seasons, many nestlings were also orphaned before being able to fend for themselves. Other, less convincing contributing factors have been suggested at times, including mass drownings, Newcastle disease, and migrations to areas outside their original range.|$|R
40|$|According to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red Data List {{nearly a}} quarter of the world's bird species are either {{threatened}} or at risk of extinction. To be able to protect endangered species, we need accurate survey methods that reliably estimate numbers and hence population trends. Acoustic monitoring is the most commonly-used method to survey birds, particularly cryptic and nocturnal species, not least because it is non-invasive, unbiased, and relatively time-effective. Unfortunately, the resulting data still have to be analysed manually. The current practice, manual spectrogram reading, is tedious, prone to bias due to observer variations, and not reproducible. While there is a large literature on automatic recognition of targeted recordings of small numbers of species, automatic analysis of long field recordings has not been well studied to date. This thesis considers this problem in detail, presenting experiments demonstrating the true efficacy of recorders in natural environments under different conditions, and then working to reduce the noise present in the recording, as well as to segment and recognise a range of New Zealand native bird species. The primary issues with field recordings are that the birds are at variable distances from the recorder, that the recordings are corrupted by many different forms of noise, that the environment affects the quality of the recorded sound, and that birdsong is often relatively rare within a recording. Thus, methods of dealing with faint calls, denoising, and effective segmentation are all needed before individual species can be recognised reliably. Experiments presented in this thesis demonstrate clearly the effects of distance and environment on recorded calls. Some of these results are unsurprising, for example an inverse square relationship with distance is largely true. Perhaps more surprising is that the height from which a call is transmitted has a signifcant effect on the recorded sound. Statistical analyses of the experiments, which demonstrate many significant environmental and sound factors, are presented. Regardless of these factors, the recordings have noise present, and removing this noise is helpful for reliable recognition. A method for denoising based on the wavelet packet decomposition is presented and demonstrated to significantly improve the quality of recordings. Following this, wavelets were also used to implement a call detection algorithm that identifies regions of the recording with calls from a target bird species. This algorithm is validated using four New Zealand native species namely Australasian bittern (Botaurus poiciloptilus), brown kiwi (Apteryx mantelli), morepork (Ninox novaeseelandiae), and kakapo (<b>Strigops</b> <b>habroptilus),</b> but could be used for any species. The results demonstrate high recall rates and tolerate false positives when compared to human experts...|$|R
40|$|Conservation {{medicine}} is increasingly being {{viewed as an}} important component of conservation biology. While programmes focussing on wildlife health are generally limited to controlling the spread of infectious diseases, {{there is a need to}} evaluate the impacts of non-infectious diseases: in particular, a critical examination of invasive management practices is overdue. Marking or tagging animals for identification is one of the most common management tools employed by conservation managers, and yet their impacts have rarely been quantified. In the kakapo, <b>Strigops</b> <b>habroptilus,</b> metallic bands applied to the tarsus were implicated in joint problems in the banded leg; in contrast to this, subcutaneously implanted passive integrated transponders appear to be safe and effective in both adults and chicks. In the North Island robin, Petroica longipes, leg bands were directly implicated in leg injuries at a rate of 2 % of adults per year. The most common injury was a result of the birds trapping their hallux (back toe) between a band and their leg; this forced the leg into a flexed position and resulted in tissue damage. To accurately interpret clinical pathology data collected in wildlife health assessments, reference ranges for haematological and biochemical data should be generated for each species. In the kakapo, blood samples from 1996 and 2002 allowed these references to be produced; however, this exercise highlighted limitations that are often underappreciated in conservation medicine. Many factors can influence the results: two of these being sample storage and laboratory processing methods. Many conservation programmes cannot collect, store and process samples in an ideal environment and, thus, comparisons between ideally generated reference ranges and data from individuals collected in the field may be spurious. Similarly, opportunistic carcass collection and post-mortem examination provides valuable identification of disease agents, but the findings are difficult to interpret in terms of their importance or prevalence within populations. The description of aspergillosis in a North Island robin is a case in point. The movement of animals for conservation purposes - translocations - is becoming widespread, and has the potential to introduce diseases into disease-free areas; the stitchbird, Notiomystis cincta, is currently the focus of conservation efforts that rely on translocations. Two poorly-understood diseases were examined: facial dermatitis and sub-lingual oral fistulas. The prevalence of facial dermatitis was influenced by season and sex, with males showing a higher prevalence of the condition than females during the breeding season. Histopathology, mite isolation and a therapeutic drug trial all suggest that a burrowing mite, Knemidocoptes spp is responsible for the condition. Sub-lingual oral fistulas are more widespread than previously thought, as they are not limited to birds with obvious tongue protrusions through the tissue deficit in the lower mandible. Evidence supports the hypothesis that these fistulas are acquired after fledging, and have a limited impact on bird productivity and survival...|$|R

Conservation Genetics, 4 : 265 - 274 The genes {{of the major}} histocompatibility complex (MHC) are highly polymorphic and play a direct role in disease resistance. Loss of variation at MHC loci may increase extinction risk in endangered species, due to an inability to combat a range of pathogens. In this thesis, the evolution of class II B MHC genes is investigated, and levels of variation at these loci are measured in two species of New Zealand robin, the endangered Chatham Island black robin (Petroica traversi), and the non-endangered South Island robin (Petroica australis australis). Transcribed class II B MHC loci from both black robin and South Island robin were characterised prior to analysis of MHC variation. To this end, a non-lethal protocol for isolation of transcribed sequences from blood using 3 'RACE and RT-PCR was developed. Four class II B cDNA sequences were isolated from black robin, and eight sequences were isolated from the South Island robin, indicating {{there are at least}} four class II B loci. RFLP analysis indicated that all class II MHC loci were contained in a single linkage group. Analysis of 3 'untranslated region sequences enabled orthologous loci to be identified in the two species, and indicated that multiple rounds of gene duplication have occurred. A partial genomic DNA sequence of a putative pseudogene was also isolated from the black robin. Evolution of MHC genes in New Zealand robins appears to be influenced by gene conversion and balancing selection, resulting in loss of orthologous relationships in the coding region, and a highly diverse peptide-binding region. In order to assess the effect of population bottlenecks on MHC variation, levels of variation in the extant black robin population, which is descended from a single breeding pair, were compared with artificially bottlenecked populations of South Island robin and their respective source populations. Both RFLP and sequence analysis indicated that the black robin is monomorphic at class II B loci, while both source and bottlenecked populations of South Island robin have retained moderate to high levels of variation. Comparison of MHC variation with minisatellite DNA variation in each population indicated that genetic drift was the predominant force determining MHC diversity in bottlenecked populations in the short-term. Despite its lack of MHC variation, the black robin population appears to be viable under existing conditions. The evolutionary history of New Zealand's Petroica species, investigated by phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequences, is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|A {{central concern}} {{involved}} {{in attempts to}} manage the natural world is a philosophical debate over {{the nature of our}} understanding of it. Central to this debate is the reality of the natural world as 'described' by science and its reality as 'revealed' within the social sciences, particularly in postmodern thought, as being, at least in part, a linguistic construction. The scientific epistemology based on the 'description' of a separate reality is deconstructed by postmodern thought as an ideology that is itself implicated in environmental destruction. In addition, it is understood to involve an appropriation of consciousness and its alignment with an order of material and mathematical understanding. This ability to stand apart and know the world allows the management of nature. As such, endangered species such as the Kakapo (<b>Strigops.</b> <b>habroptilus)</b> are placed under management regimes {{in order to reduce the}} likely hood of their extinction. However, some postmodern thought, through an over emphasis on reality’s linguistic construction, also leaves nature open to arrangement in order to meet socially projected understandings of it. In both of these positions nature loses its autonomy, and standing as an essential counterpoint to society. This in turn highlights the concern of whether conservation should include a controlling interaction with nature or whether the preservation of wildness, that constitutes nature as contingent and autonomous, is a more important relation. The South Island Kokako (Callaeas. cinerea. cinerea), itself an endangered species (and possibly now even extinct), through its elusive nature and ability to evade capture, sits as a symbol for all that is ineffable and mysterious in nature. This recognition of the ineffable is implicit in ecological understandings that highlight interconnectedness and indeed human immersion in larger processes. Such immersion in the world places limitations on a normative identification of nature. I argue that from the recognition of the ineffable comes respect, as such, the ineffable acts as the basis of an ethical relation with the natural world. Such a recognition comes from first hand interaction that is emphasised in this phenomenological based analysis. This highlights the importance of individual experience of nature as being vital to developing an ethical relation. Such ongoing experience also feeds into culture through stories that in turn act to adapt tradition. A concern for the experiential is highlighted in ritual activities. These activities attempt to address our relation with the natural world and our place in it that does not involve its manipulation, but resolves from treating nature as essentially mysterious. This is in contrast to the experience based in restorative approaches that aim at manipulation to meet human requirements. In consideration of the foregoing I attempt to trace the manner in which conservation fieldworkers understand their management practices and the philosophical understandings put forward by them in order to justify these practices. This includes the significance of their experiences of the natural world and the stories and ideologies of control that impinge upon their understandings. In conclusion I argue that the present praxis based preservationist tradition downplays the importance of experience, and of wildness as an essential aspect of the natural world, although these are in part recognised by my informants. Rather, it is a normative ordering that is based mostly on a scientific narrative and metaphysic that in turn risks being seperationist and colonising...|$|R
40|$|Kākāpō (<b>Strigops</b> <b>habroptilus)</b> are a {{critically}} endangered parrot species endemic to New Zealand that exhibit a reproductive strategy linked to “masting” years. Crucial to their survival is increased reproductive success. It has been hypothesised that their pattern of reproduction is synchronised with a steroidal “trigger” present in plants during intensive masting. If {{this hypothesis is}} valid, then Kākāpō and other closely related NZ parrots might be receptive to these masting plants in a manner {{different from that of}} other avian species. The aims of this study were firstly, to identify whether unique amino acid motifs were present in the ligand binding domains (LBD) for the steroid receptors oestrogen receptor α (ER-α), oestrogen receptor β (ER-β), androgen receptor (AR) and progesterone receptor (PR) for the New Zealand parrots Kākāpō, Kākā, Kākāriki and Kea. These LBD amino acid sequences were compared with those in an Australian parrot, the Cockatiel, as well as in Chicken and Japanese Quail. Moreover, the role of these amino acid changes on the binding of ligands (both the native ligand and other steroidogenic compounds) for ER-α was assessed by in silico modelling by comparing the most favourable binding position of the ligands in the three-dimensional structure of Kākāpō ER-α with that of human ER-α. The second aim was to test extracts of New Zealand native plants known to be a food source for Kākāpō for their seasonal variation in oestrogenic activity and hence possible involvement in the reproductive cycle of Kākāpō. The LBD for ER-β and AR of the parrot species (New Zealand and Australian) displayed 100 % identity whilst those for ER-α and PR had variations. When the parrot sequences were compared with those for other avian species and human, {{there were a number of}} amino acid differences present, with the greatest disparity present in the LBD of ER-α. From in silico modelling studies, the amino acid substitutions in this receptor were predicted to have an indirect influence on the binding position of both 17 β-oestradiol and a number of phytoestrogens through changes in the structure of this region. Consequently, this could have an effect on the binding affinity of certain plant chemicals for ER-α and thus their potency. Plants extracts from the foliage and fruit of native New Zealand species were screened for oestrogenic activity in a yeast bioassay transfected with the human isoform of ER-α. The results from these experiments indicated that all the plants tested (excluding Dacrycarpus dacrydioides) exhibited detectable oestrogenic activity and a number also displayed variable and sometimes seasonal trends in activity. In summary, the results in this study identified ER-α LBD amino acid motifs unique to New Zealand parrots. For the other steroid receptors, the ER-β LBD had a three amino acid combination of M, V and L that was only present in the parrot species whilst both the AR and PR LBD displayed much greater inter-species conservation. These changes, particularly those in the ER-α LBD, may influence the binding of steroidogenic compounds, known to be present in the plants consumed by Kākāpō as demonstrated by in silico modelling. Thus, this research provides evidence that the diet of Kākāpō may influence their reproductive pattern. However, it remains to be determined whether the steroidogenic potency of these plant extracts is modified when interacting with the unique LBD of native NZ parrots...|$|R
40|$|Kakapo (<b>Strigops</b> <b>habroptilus)</b> are a flightless, nocturnal parrot {{endemic to}} New Zealand. Thought to be extinct within their natural range, kakapo are {{currently}} listed as nationally critical. The current population of 86 individuals is {{managed by the}} Department of Conservation’s National Kakapo Team on two offshore islands in southern New Zealand, with all females of breeding age on Codfish Island (Whenua Hou). Kakapo only breed once every two to five years, coinciding with the mast fruiting of specific plant species. On Codfish Island, the proportion of adult female kakapo that breed in rimu (Dacrydium cupressinum) fruiting years {{is dependent on the}} quantity of fruit produced, with fewer females attempting to breed during low mast years. The purpose of this research is to investigate why only some adult female kakapo breed in low rimu fruiting years on Codfish Island, specifically assessing if foraging home range size and/or habitat selection influence breeding. A total of 506 location points were collected at night for 18 adult female kakapo between March and May 2006. These were used to estimate foraging home ranges and to assess if kakapo select for particular types of vegetation. Ecological Niche Factor Analysis was used to determine the relative importance of habitat variables in the distribution of female kakapo and to predict areas of suitable breeding habitat when rimu fruit is limited. The breeding success of individuals in 2005, a low rimu mast year, was used to identify if differences in home ranges or habitat selection occurred between breeding and non-breeding females. The large variation in foraging home range sizes recorded in this research was consistent with previous studies. Foraging home range sizes were on average twice the size for breeders than for non-breeders, suggesting that adult female kakapo may be limited in their ability to breed {{by the size of the}} area they occupy. Adult female kakapo did not randomly use vegetation on Codfish Island as some vegetation types were not used, while others were common inside foraging home ranges. Adult female kakapo utilise a broad niche and are capable of surviving in a wide range of habitats. However, breeding females were more specialised in their niche requirements than non-breeders, with breeders utilising areas with higher abundances of mature rimu trees. Females occurred in high elevation, flat areas of the island but this may have been because this is where appropriate vegetation types occurred. During low rimu mast years, breeding adult females were predicted to occupy habitat in high elevation, plateau areas with a high abundance of rimu. Areas identified as sub-optimal habitat for breeding included the coastal areas, the lower elevation area of the main valley and some ridgelines. The home ranges of all 10 breeding females contained some optimal habitat, while females who did not breed were more likely to be located in sub-optimal habitat. Although there were significant areas of optimal breeding habitat not occupied by adult female kakapo, other kakapo may have been present in these areas. To increase the proportion of females that breed in low rimu mast years, it may be necessary to remove sub-adult females or surplus adult males living in optimal breeding habitat from the island. Alternatively, females in sub-optimal breeding habitat could be fed supplementary foods or transferred to other islands where there is unoccupied suitable breeding habitat available...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} the {{research}} presented here is the analysis of feather scent emitted by a parrot, the kakapo (<b>Strigops</b> <b>habroptilus)</b> and the kakapo’s ability to perceive scent by studying the anatomy of its brain and the olfactory bulb. In addition, behavioural research was conducted to determine the capability of the kakapo’s closest relatives, the kea (Nestor notabilis) and kaka (N. meridionalis) to detect scents and to distinguish between different concentrations of scents. The strong odour of the kakapo {{is one of the}} many unique characteristics of this critically endan-gered parrot, but its sense of smell has never been described in detail. The kakapo is the largest par-rot worldwide, it is nocturnal and flightless. Kakapo are herbivorous and it is the only parrot with a lek breeding system. Males defend several display arenas during the breeding season and continuously produce low frequency booming calls. Females come from afar and appraise different males and choose one with which they want to mate. As in all lek mating systems some males make major contributions to the gene-pool of the next generation while others make little or no contribution. Currently it is not known what the female’s choice is based on and why some male kakapo are ‘favoured’ over others. However, it has been observed that favoured males appear to emit a stronger odour than less attractive ones (pers. comm. Kakapo Recovery Team). This study is the first to compare the chemical composition of the kakapo’s scent in relation to season, age and sex. It is also the first study to uncover the kakapo’s ability to smell by conducting a comparative examination of the anatomy and histology of the brain and the olfactory bulb. In spite of its endangered status, the kakapo is a good model in which to study olfaction, as the birds are closely monitored by the Department of Conservation, New Zealand. The birds undergo regular health checks and transmitter changes, allowing access to a large proportion of the population at once and for which their individual history is known. The study of olfaction in kakapo is important as it can contribute to the growing field of avian olfaction, and by elucidating the kakapo’s potential for olfaction conservation managers will be able to make better decisions in their attempt to save this species. The research approach adopted in this dissertation includes the analysis of feather samples from individuals of different sex and age as well as from different seasons using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The opportunity to examine the brain as well as the eyes of a kakapo that died at Auckland Zoo, Auckland, New Zealand, allowed a comparative study of the brain, the olfactory bulb and the visual centres (of both the thalomofulgal and the tectogucal pathways) with other Australasian parrots. Additionally, behavioural experiments with kea and kaka, the closest relativesof the kakapo, give insight into two of New Zealand endemic parrot’s and their ability to distinguish between different scents and scents of different concentrations. The findings from this research provide evidence that kakapo distinguish themselves by having one of the largest olfactory bulbs measured in parrots and the highest number of mitral cells, responsible for the transmission of an olfactory neural signal into a behavioural response, counted in any species to date. They also have a strong odour, whose chemical composition shows sexual, age-dependent and seasonal distinction. Furthermore, the study found that kea and kaka are both able to distinguish between different scents and different concentrations of scents. The main conclusions drawn from this study are that kakapo appear to be equipped with a functional olfactory bulb, able to sense olfactory information, but also communicate information that is likely to be of social importance using their plumage scent. In conclusion, this dissertation provides the foundation for future research, in particular to examine the role of the scent in the social life in kakapo, and it provides fundamental insight into the olfactory and visual sensory abilities of the New Zealand endemic kakapo...|$|R
40|$|The cause(s) of the {{worldwide}} Late Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions and their effects on modern ecosystems has been debated by the scientific community since the widespread discovery of megafaunal fossils in the nineteenth century. New Zealand is a good case study because of its geographical isolation, resulting in the late colonisation of New Zealand by Polynesians in about 1280 AD. The subsequent extinction of New Zealand’s megafauna, including the moa (Aves: Dinornithiformes), took place {{at a time of}} relative climatic stability, and is thought to be due to over-hunting and habitat destruction. The aim of this thesis, using moa as a case study, is to conduct a detailed examination of a megafaunal palaeoecosystem prior to the introduction of humans. In this thesis, Chapter One reviews the literature concerning the causes and consequences of the Late Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions; the evolution of moa; New Zealand ecology; ancient DNA and its applications; and coalescent theory. The aims and structure of the thesis is then outlined. To investigate the New Zealand palaeoecosystem using moa, it is first necessary to examine the quality of the recent moa fossil record. This is especially important because specimens used in temporal population demographic analyses need to be interpreted in the correct depositional context and timeframe. There {{have been a number of}} theories proposed to explain the deposition mechanisms of swamp deposits, or, more correctly, miring bone deposits, including large floods and stampeding during wildfires. Chapter Two discusses the taphonomy of three different New Zealand swamp deposits that were reconstructed using a novel ARC-GIS methodology specifically designed for this study. It concludes that the reconstructions are consistent with noncatastrophic periodic miring of individual moa. To gain an insight into the faunal composition of North Canterbury, New Zealand in the Late Glacial period (10, 000 - 14, 000 years ago), and how moa responded to climate and habitat change, I led a team that re-excavated the Late Glacial Glencrieff miring bone deposit and reconstructed the palaeofauna. The analysis presented in Chapter Three shows the Glencrieff fauna was a characteristic glacial fauna, despite extensive climatic and habitat change during this period. A new opportunity to examine moa palaeoecology has been presented by the discovery of moa coprolites. Previous reconstructions of moa diet have concluded that moa were predominantly browsers of trees and shrubs. There is considerable debate over the role of moa in the evolution of ‘anti-browsing’ growth characteristics found in many of the New Zealand flora. Chapter Four discusses the analysis of newly discovered coprolite deposits and subsequent reconstructions of moa diet. The results challenge historical perceptions of moa diet, showing there was considerable overlap in dietary preferences between different moa species, despite differences in skull and bill morphology, with the majority of plants eaten being less than 30 cm in height. In addition, plants with ‘anti-browsing’ growth characteristics were found in the coprolites, consistent with the moa anti-browsing hypothesis. To further study moa ecology I led a genetic investigation of moa appearance using moa feathers. The current knowledge of moa plumage is limited because the majority of moa feathers are recovered as isolated specimens in caves and rockshelters, and cannot be related to specific species. In Chapter Five, ancient DNA (aDNA) is extracted from isolated sub-fossil feathers and used to identify species. Digital techniques used to reconstruct moa plumage indicate that four species of moa were characterised by either a plain brown slightly streaky plumage or a speckled plumage, with considerable overlap in plumage between species. The overlap may be due to convergent evolution of feather colour for camouflage against aerial predators as observed in many other New Zealand bird species, for example kiwi (Apteryx spp.), kakapo (<b>Strigops</b> <b>habroptilus),</b> kea (Nestor notabilis), takahe (Porphyrio hochstetteri) and weka (Gallirallus australis). In Chapters Six and Seven I analyse how moa species have responded to changes in climate and habitat since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 29 - 19 Kya in New Zealand). Ancient DNA and fossil records are used to examine the responses of the extinct crested moa (Pachyornis australis) and heavy-footed moa (Pachyornis elephantopus) to climate and habitat change. I show that crested moa tracked changes in its sub-alpine habitat since the LGM due to warming climate with little effect on population size. Concurrently, climate and habitat change promoted phylogeographic structuring and allometric size variation within heavy-footed moa. Importantly, while climate and habitat change had an effect on moa, it did not cause their ultimate extinction. Chapter Eight further investigates the temporal population demographic methods used in Chapters Six and Seven. I discuss how sampling biases common to most aDNA datasets affect the robustness of the Bayesian Skyline Plot (BSP), a commonly used analytical method for inferring the past population demographic history of species or populations. The analyses indicate that sampling biases produced large variations in the BSP of Beringian Steppe Bison and Pachyornis moa, when the datasets were re-examined and re-sampled to simulate sampling biases. Importantly, this reveals the BSP may not accurately reflect the true demographic history of a species or population when analysing contemporary genetic data alone. Finally, the thesis concludes with a discussion drawing together, and interpreting the outcomes and significance of the research and argues that the results of this research represent a significant addition to our present knowledge of the pre-human New Zealand megafaunal palaeoecosystem.

40|$|The age {{structure}} of populations {{is an important}} and often unresolved factor in ecology and wildlife management. Parameters like onset of reproduction and senescence, reproductive success and survival rate are tightly correlated with age. Unfortunately, age information of wild animals {{is not easy to}} obtain, especially for birds, where few anatomical markers of age exist. Longitudinal age data from birds banded as chicks are rare, particularly in long lived species. Age estimation in such species would be extremely useful as their long life span typically indicates slow population growth and potentially the need for protection and conservation. Telomere length change has been suggested as a universal marker for ageing vertebrates and potentially other animals. This method, termed molecular ageing, is based on a shortening of telomeres with each cell division. In birds, the telomere length of erythrocytes has been reported to decline with age, as the founder cells (haematopoietic stem cells) divide to renew circulating red blood cells. I measured telomere length in kakapo, the world largest parrot and four other bird species (Buller’s albatross, kea, New Zealand robin and saddleback) using telomere restriction fragment analysis (TRF) to assess the potential for molecular ageing in these species. After providing an overview of methods to measure telomere length, I describe how one of them (TRF) measures telomere length by quantifying the size distribution of terminal restriction fragments using southern blot of in-gel hybridization (Chapter 2). Although TRF is currently the ‘gold standard’ to measure telomere length, it suffers from various technical problems that can compromise precision and accuracy of telomere length estimation. In addition, there are many variations of the protocol, complicating comparisons between publications. I focused on TRF analysis using a non-radioactive probe, because it does not require special precautions associated with handling and disposing of radioactive material and therefore is more suitable for ecology laboratories that typically do not have a strong molecular biology infrastructure. However, most of my findings can be applied to both, radioactive and nonradioactive TRF variants. I tested how sample storage, choice of restriction enzyme, gel Abstract II electrophoresis and choice of hybridization buffer can influence the results. Finally, I show how image analysis (e. g. background correction, gel calibration, formula to calculate telomere length and the analysis window) can not only change the magnitude of estimated telomere length, but also their correlation to each other. Based on these findings, I present and discuss an extensive list of methodological difficulties associated with TRF and present a protocol to obtain reliable and reproducible results. Using this optimized protocol, I then measured telomere length of 68 kakapo (Chapter 3). Almost half of the current kakapo population consists of birds that were captured as adults, hence only their minimum age is known (i. e. time from when they were found + 5 years to reach adulthood). Although molecular ageing {{might not be able to}} predict chronological age accurately, as calibrated with minimum age of some birds, it should be able to compare relative age between birds. Recently, the oldest kakapo (Richard Henry) was found to show signs of reproductive senescence. The age (or telomere length) difference to Richard Henry could have been used to approximate the remaining reproductive time span for other birds. Unfortunately, there was no change of telomere length with age in cross sectional and longitudinal samples. Analysis of fitness data available for kakapo yielded correlations between telomere length and fledging success, but they were weak and disappeared when the most influential bird was excluded from analysis. The heavy management and small numbers of kakapo make conclusions about fitness and telomere length difficult and highly speculative. However, telomere length of mothers and their chicks were significantly correlated, a phenomena not previously observed in any bird. To test if the lack of telomere loss with age is specific to <b>kakapo,</b> <b>I</b> measured telomere length of one of its closest relatives: the kea (Chapter 4). Like kakapo, telomere length did not show any correlation with age. I then further assessed the usefulness of molecular ageing in birds using only chicks and very old birds to estimate the maximum TL range in an additional long lived (Buller’s albatross) and two shorter lived species (NZ robin and saddleback). In these Abstract III species, telomere length was on average higher in chicks than in adults. However, age matched individuals showed high variations in telomere length, such that age dependent and independent telomere length could not be distinguished. These data and published results from other bird species, coupled with the limitations of methodology I have identified (Chapter 2), indicate that molecular ageing does not work in most (if not all) birds in its current suggested form. Another way to measure telomere length is telomere Q-PCR, a real-time PCR based method. Measurement of the same kakapo samples with TRF and Q-PCR did not result in comparable results (Chapter 4). Through experimentation I found that differences in amplification efficiency between samples lead to unreliable estimation of telomere length using telomere Q-PCR. These differences were caused by inhibitors present in the samples. The problem of differential amplification efficiency in Q-PCR, while known, is largely ignored by the scientific community. Although some methods have been suggested to correct for differing efficiency, most of these introduce more error than they eliminate. I developed and applied an assay based on internal standard oligonucleotides that was able to corrected EDTA induced quantification errors of up to 70 % with high precision and accuracy (Chapter 5). The method, however, failed when tested with other inhibitors commonly found in DNA samples extracted from blood (i. e. SDS, heparin, urea and FeCl 3). PCR inhibition was highly selective in the probe-polymerase system I used, inhibiting amplification of genomic DNA, but not amplification of internal oligonucleotide or plasmid standards in the same reaction. Internal standards are a key feature of most diagnostic PCR assays to identify false negatives arising from amplification inhibition. The differential response to inhibition I identified greatly compromises the accuracy of these assays. Consequently, I strongly recommend that researchers using PCR assays with internal standards should verify that the target DNA and internal standard actually respond similarly to common inhibitors...|$|R
