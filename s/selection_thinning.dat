40|$|Summary &mdash; Growth {{responses}} of holm oak (Quercus ilex) to commercial thinning were {{studied in the}} Montseny Biosphere Reserve (northeast Spain), where <b>selection</b> <b>thinning</b> for firewood production is currently the dominant form of management in holm oak forests. Thinning significantly increased mean stem diameter increment by 83 % over that of unthinned plots during the 6 - 9 -yr period after thinning, and by 48 % from 9 - 12 yr after thinning. Absolute diameter increment was positively corre-lated with initial diameter at 1. 30 m from the ground (dbh) both in thinned and unthinned plots. Thin-ning increased growth in large trees more than in smaller trees. Relative diameter growth was nega-tively correlated with initial dbh. It is concluded that individual holm oak stems in previously coppiced stands respond vigourously to thinning, and still do so 6 - 9 yr after thinning. The growth response di-minishes 9 - 12 yr after thinning due to canopy closure. However, absolute rates of stand growth, as well as basal area and stem biomass increments, were unaffected by thinning during these time in-tervals, an example of density compensation. canopy closure I Quercus ilex = holm oak I <b>selection</b> <b>thinning</b> I stand growth / tree growth Résumé &mdash; Effet d’une éclaircie commerciale sur la croissance d’un chêne vert (Quercus ilex L) dans les montagnes du Montseny (NE de l’Espagne).

40|$|Thinning of {{plantations}} is a recognised {{practice for}} concentrating growth onto selected trees while providing an intermediate {{return from the}} thinnings. A great deal of {{work has been done}} on methods for estimating optimum time and weight of thinning for the particular stand. However, the selection of individual trees to be thinned in the forest has relaxed in recent years to make thinning more flexible, reduce costs and to better facilitate mechanised harvesting. Some plantations are now being thinned by the harvesting machine operator selecting the trees to be thinned while harvesting. A series of field trials were undertaken in Pinus radiata plantation at Rennick, Victoria, to compare conventional tree marked thinning with operator selected thinning (OST) where the harvesting machine operator selected trees while harvesting. The results indicate good control of tree selection by the operators: thinning to the same density and diameter distribution as the tree marked treatment while removing all required defect trees. Operator tree selection did not affect harvesting productivity, however, it improved log processing time in a second thinning by an experienced tree selecting operator, it also improved falling and work cycle time (approach tree, fall and process) in first thinning on a high site quality. Thinning trials at an operational level, about 6 ha, tested operator <b>selection</b> <b>thinning</b> to two different sets of guidelines: a diameter limit; and spacing requirements for residual trees. These OST thinning operations were no worse than the conventional tree marked thinning and resulted in less residual tree damage and more trees harvested per hour in second thinning.

Morphological observations of small soil volumes were made on disturbed samples by the method of Ponge, but here transformed into quantitative data. Analysis of the data gave evidence of a large degree of heterogeneity of the form of humus in a given forest stand, {{but most of the}} observed variation might be explained by differences in vegetation, due to phases of the forest cycle and sylvicultural practices. Regeneration sites are characterized by the development of a herbaceous cover under which a mull humus is built through the activity of burrowing earthworm species. During the phase of intense growth of spruce organic matter accumulates in the top few centimeters. At this stage, the Al horizon previously formed under the action of endogeous earthworms becomes inactive but its crumby structure remains stable. Anecic worms (earthworms with a high amplitude of vertical movements) appear again under adult trees. As a result, changes in the form of humus are observed, with seemingly mull formation (burying of litter) but without true incorporation of organic matter to mineral matter. This humus was named dysmull. Thus soil conditions that prevail in the regeneration sites were developed to some extent under pre-existing adult trees. A parallel evolution of soil fauna, form. of humus and vegetation may thus be described. The above mentioned sequence {{is not the only one}} possible.

The OpTimber-LP® software, which performs the simulations using SisPinus® software, was used for forest optimization. The regimes consisted of different combinations of forest sites, planting densities, thinning regimes and clearcutting ages, totaling 17, 760 regimes per site. Wood production was quantified and evaluated by assortment classes. Planting, thinning and harvesting costs were considered. The Annualized Net Present Value (ANPV) and the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of each management regime were calculated. As a result, the density of 1, 600 plants per ha optimized ANPV for most cases. Optimized regimes included no or only one thinning and provided ANPV of 2, 753 and 158 BRL per ha and IRR of 22. 9 % and 2. 9 % for sites I and IV, respectively.

40|$|Summary &mdash; In Austria oak stands occupy an area {{covering}} &ap; 150 000 ha or &ap; 4 % of {{the total}} forest area. Half of the oak stands are managed as coppice or coppice with standards, and half are man-aged as high forest.

Therefore regeneration methods, timely and proper management and thinning regimes will be very important in the near future. As a result of different growth performances it is necessary to determine different production targets and rotation cycles. For this reason treatment programmes have been developed dependent on selected sites considering biological, ecological and technical parameters to achieve high economic yield. Investigations into oak stands of different age classes have already shown the importance of timely cleaning, tending and continuous thinning during the first third of the rotation cycles.

We {{take advantage of the}} notion of structure of the signal introduced by the MMP to get a precise representation of audio signals, and then by using a psychoacoustic model we can embed a watermark efficiently on the signal. By selecting atoms of time frequency components that are not perceptible by the human ear we ensure the security and imperceptibility of the watermark. Then by a <b>thinner</b> <b>selection</b> of the watermark host spots we ensure the robustness of our watermark to main kind of attacks, especially lossy compression attacks such as mp 3 compression. We show the efficiency of this method thanks to a non-blind watermark recovery algorithm which confirms this method is robust and particularly adapted to long audio signals...|$|R
