They performed the <b>survival</b> <b>training</b> in pairs, carrying only their parachutes and survival kits. Chaffee, with help from his Boy Scout training, foraged for enough food to survive during the three-day training mission. Following the jungle training, the astronauts traveled to an entirely different environment: the desert of Reno, Nevada. For clothing, the astronauts had only long underwear, shoes, and robes they manufactured from their parachutes. Lizards and snakes were the main source of food, and the astronauts used their parachutes as makeshift tents for shelter for the two days of desert training.|$|E

The squadron received its crest in 1988 and in 1991 was granted the Freedom of the City of Townsville. In May 1988 the Squadron began operating the RAAF Townsville Museum. During its period as a reserve squadron its personnel worked alongside members of the Permanent Air Force during exercises, operations and day-to-day activities.

25|$|The {{squadron}} {{settled into}} a two-year training pattern, with the first consisting of General Service training and the second Specialist, while continuing to accept new recruits as each course graduated. The squadron also provided an introduction to Air Force life for those who been awarded RAAF Undergraduate Scholarships as recipients were posted to University Squadrons. Biouvouacs and <b>survival</b> <b>training</b> were held at Greenbank and the Jungle Training Centre at Canungra {{under the control of}} Army personnel, and at Beechmont, Lake Manchester and Colleges Crossing. General Service Training and/or on the job training was held at RAAF establishments at Rathmines, Richmond, Laverton, Elizabeth, Wagga, Williamtown, Garbutt, and Amberley (almost exclusively from the late 1960s). During the academic year, training was held on Wednesday evening. Members enlisted into the PAF under the Undergraduate Scholarship Scheme were required to attend Wednesday parades to undertake the basic Officer Training Course. Graduation parades after about 1958 were held at the squadron's base. However, in the late 1960s when the squadron's continuous training camps were held at Amberley a good relationship between the RAAF base and the squadron developed. With the encouragement of the then Air Commodore Deryck Kingwell CBE DSO, graduation parades were held at Amberley.|$|E
