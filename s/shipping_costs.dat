However, previous research indicates that bidders do not fully incorporate <b>shipping</b> <b>cost</b> when bidding. To examine the effects of <b>shipping</b> <b>cost</b> on eBay auctions, we look at completed auctions for five different items: a trading card, a DVD, a gold coin, a silver proof set, and a laptop. In our analysis, we find across all items that bidders do not fully incorporate <b>shipping</b> <b>cost</b> when they bid. Furthermore, dollar for dollar, increasing <b>shipping</b> <b>cost</b> yields higher revenues than increasing the minimum starting bid, conditional on sale. <b>Shipping</b> <b>cost</b> also has a smaller negative effect on the number of bidders and the probability of an auction having no bids than the starting bid...|$|R

25|$|A 1997 report {{prepared}} by Oxfam America and the Washington Office on Latin America, Myths And Facts About The U.S. Embargo On Medicine And Medical Supplies, {{concluded that the}} embargo forced Cuba to use more of its limited resources on medical imports, both because equipment and drugs from foreign subsidiaries of U.S. firms or from non-U.S.sources tend to be higher priced and because <b>shipping</b> <b>costs</b> are greater. The Democracy Act of 1992 further exacerbated the problems in Cuba's medical system. It prohibited foreign subsidiaries of U.S. corporations from selling to Cuba, thus further limiting Cuba's access to medicine and equipment, and raising prices. In addition, the act forbids ships that dock in Cuban ports from docking in U.S. ports for six months. This drastically restricts shipping, and increases <b>shipping</b> <b>costs</b> some 30%.|$|E

40|$|Abstract We {{investigate}} the hardness of approximating a transshipment {{problem with a}} permutable transit vector. We have already known that the transshipment problem of minimizing the total <b>shipping</b> <b>cost</b> is NP-hard. In this paper, we prove {{that even if the}} unit <b>shipping</b> <b>cost</b> associated with every arc is given as a positive integer, there is no polynomial time constant factor approximation algorithm for the transshipment problem under the hypothesis that P =NP. We obtain the inapproximability result by a gap-introducing reduction from an NP-complete problem by the name of 3 DM. On the other hand, we propose a preparatory heuristic algorithm to the transshipment problem, which is based on a relaxation into the minimum cost flow problem and the minimum weight perfect matching on a bipartite graph. We also provide an upper bound of the total <b>shipping</b> <b>cost</b> obtained by the proposed heuristic...|$|R
40|$|When a make-to-order {{manufacturing}} company adopts a commit-to-delivery business mode, it commits a delivery due date for an order and {{is responsible for}} the <b>shipping</b> <b>cost.</b> Without loss of generality, we consider that transportation is done by a third party logistics company such as FedEx or UPS, which provides multiple shipping modes such as overnight, one-day, two-day delivery, and more. When the transportation time has to be short, clearly <b>shipping</b> <b>cost</b> is more expensive than it could have been. How should a company schedule production for accepted orders so that the company can leave enough transportation time for orders to take slow shipping modes to reduce the <b>shipping</b> <b>cost?</b> We study this problem of integrating the production and transportation functions for a {{manufacturing company}} producing a variety of customized products in a make-to-order environment with a commit-to-delivery mode of business. Various realistic scenarios are investigated, in increasing order of complexity. When partial delivery is allowed by customers, we provide both an MIP model and a minimum cost flow model. We show that nonpreemptive EDD production schedules are optimal when partial delivery is allowed and <b>shipping</b> <b>cost</b> is a decreasing convex function with transportation time. When partial delivery is not allowed, we develop an MIP model and prove that the problem is NP-hard. An efficient heuristic algorithm with polynomial computation time is provided for the NP-hard problem. It gives nearoptimal production schedules, as shown via thousands of numerical experiments. We also provide models and analysis for other scenarios where <b>shipping</b> <b>cost</b> accounts for customer locations and quantity discounts. 1...|$|R
25|$|The large {{profits in}} the North Carolina {{furniture}} industry lessened with {{the increasing number of}} factories. In addition to the increased competition for market shares, by 1910 the salary for competent experienced workers and rising <b>shipping</b> <b>costs</b> had cut further into the profit. Bankruptcies resulted from inexperienced managers who tried to sell products below the cost of production and companies that tried to expand too quickly. An innovative High Point company, Tomlinson Chair Co., devised incentives to give its workforce an opportunity to receive part of the profits.

25|$|Other {{researchers}} and historians have strongly contested {{what has come}} to be referred to as the “Williams thesis” in academia. David Richardson has concluded that the profits from the slave trade amounted to less than 1% of domestic investment in Britain. Economic historian Stanley Engerman finds that even without subtracting the associated costs of the slave trade (e.g., <b>shipping</b> <b>costs,</b> slave mortality, mortality of British people in Africa, defense costs) or reinvestment of profits back into the slave trade, the total profits from the slave trade and of West Indian plantations amounted to less than 5% of the British economy during any year of the Industrial Revolution. Engerman's 5% figure gives as much as possible in terms of benefit of the doubt to the Williams argument, not solely because it does not take into account the associated costs of the slave trade to Britain, but also because it carries the full-employment assumption from economics and holds the gross value of slave trade profits as a direct contribution to Britain's national income. Historian Richard Pares, in an article written before Williams' book, dismisses the influence of wealth generated from the West Indian plantations upon the financing of the Industrial Revolution, stating that whatever substantial flow of investment from West Indian profits into industry there occurred after emancipation, not before.|$|E
