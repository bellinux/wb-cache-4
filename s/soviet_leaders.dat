5|$|In March 1977, U.S. President Jimmy Carter {{met with}} Bukovsky at the White House. In the USSR {{the meeting was}} seen by dissidents and rights activists {{as a sign of}} the newly elected president's {{willingness}} to stress human rights in his foreign policy; the event provoked harsh criticism by <b>Soviet</b> <b>leaders.</b>|$|E
5|$|The goal of {{his policy}} was to {{withdraw}} all the U.S. forces from Europe. The settlement reached {{would give the}} Kremlin sufficient reassurance against the establishment of regimes in Eastern Europe hostile to the Soviet Union, tempering the degree of control over that area that the <b>Soviet</b> <b>leaders</b> {{felt it necessary to}} exercise.|$|E
5|$|During 1987, {{relations}} improved steadily, with U.S. military inspectors {{present at}} Soviet military manoeuvres, {{an agreement to}} establish centers on Reducing Nuclear Threat, and a first round of negotiations aimed at banning nuclear tests. The thaw in relations {{was reflected in the}} cultural sphere. Matlock’s invitation to ballerina Maya Plisetskaya to attend a reception at Spaso House provided a way for Matlock to judge Gorbachev’s intentions, as earlier <b>Soviet</b> <b>leaders</b> would have considered it a provocation.|$|E

5|$|During the {{funerals}} of <b>Soviet</b> <b>leaders</b> {{there was a}} custom of displaying their decorations on velvet cushions, which were carried in the procession behind the coffin. This task was traditionally given to an escort of senior officers, each carrying a cushion with one decoration on it. However, as Brezhnev had {{more than two hundred}} decorations, several were placed on each cushion. Brezhnev's funeral officer escort ultimately included forty-four persons.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his visit}} to China, Nixon met with <b>Soviet</b> <b>leaders,</b> {{including}} Brezhnev in Moscow. These Strategic Arms Limitation Talks resulted in two landmark arms control treaties: SALT I, the first comprehensive limitation pact signed by the two superpowers, and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which banned the development of systems designed to intercept incoming missiles. These aimed to limit the development of costly anti-ballistic missiles and nuclear missiles.|$|E
5|$|In December 1981, Poland's Wojciech Jaruzelski {{reacted to}} the crisis by {{imposing}} a period of martial law. Reagan imposed economic sanctions on Poland in response. Mikhail Suslov, the Kremlin's top ideologist, advised <b>Soviet</b> <b>leaders</b> not to intervene if Poland fell {{under the control of}} Solidarity, for fear it might lead to heavy economic sanctions, representing a catastrophe for the Soviet economy.|$|E

5|$|The party {{leadership}} meeting in Warsaw on 20 December recognized {{the danger that}} the working class revolt presented to their system, and, in consultations with the disturbed <b>Soviet</b> <b>leaders,</b> proceeded with arranging the resignation of Gomułka, who was by then stressed out and ill. Several of his collaborators were also removed. Edward Gierek was drafted as the new first secretary. Mieczysław Moczar, another strong contender, was not trusted (or was even blamed for the current debacle) by the Soviets.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the 1973 oil crisis, {{combined}} with the growing influence of Third World alignments such as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the Non-Aligned Movement, less-powerful countries had more room to assert their independence and often showed themselves resistant to pressure from either superpower. Meanwhile, Moscow was forced to turn its attention inward to deal with the Soviet Union's deep-seated domestic economic problems. During this period, <b>Soviet</b> <b>leaders</b> such as Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin embraced the notion of détente.|$|E
5|$|A {{pressing}} issue {{not resolved}} by Wilson {{was the question}} of policy towards Bolshevik Russia. The U.S. had been among the nations that had sent troops there after the Russian Revolution. Afterwards, Wilson refused to recognize the Russian SFSR. Under Harding, Commerce Secretary Hoover, with considerable experience of Russian affairs, took the lead on policy. When famine struck Russia in 1921, Hoover had the American Relief Administration, which he had headed, negotiate with the Russians to provide aid. <b>Soviet</b> <b>leaders</b> (the U.S.S.R. was established in 1922) hoped in vain that the agreement would lead to recognition. Hoover supported trade with the Soviets, fearing U.S. companies would be frozen out of the Soviet market, but Hughes opposed this, and the matter was not resolved under Harding's presidency.|$|E

5|$|In Moscow, between November and December 1964, at two {{sessions}} of the Presidium of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee, <b>Soviet</b> <b>leaders</b> discussed {{the topic of}} Soviet military aid to North Vietnam. Although details of the discussions were not made public, the first indication of Soviet strategy in Vietnam came on 24 December 1964, when the Soviet government invited the North Vietnamese-backed National Liberation Front to open a permanent mission in Moscow. Then on 4 February 1965 McGeorge Bundy, national security adviser to President Johnson, arrived in Saigon {{to meet with the}} then U.S. Ambassador to South Vietnam, General Maxwell Taylor, to discuss the political situation in the country. Two days later on 6 February 1965, Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin arrived in Hanoi for a historic visit to North Vietnam, included in his entourage was a team of Soviet missile experts.|$|E
5|$|Mikoyan {{supported}} Stalin, whom he {{had first}} met in 1919, in the power struggle that followed Lenin's death in 1924; {{he had become a}} member of the Bolshevik Central Committee in 1923. As People's Commissar for External and Internal Trade from 1926, he imported ideas from the West, such as the manufacture of canned goods. In 1935 he was elected to the Politburo, and was among one of the first <b>Soviet</b> <b>leaders</b> to pay goodwill trips to the United States in order to boost economic cooperation. Mikoyan spent three months in the United States, where he not only learned more about its food industry but also met and spoke with Henry Ford and inspected Macy's in New York. When he returned, Mikoyan introduced a number of popular American consumer products to the Soviet Union, including American hamburgers, ice cream, corn flakes, popcorn, tomato juice, grapefruit, and corn on the cob.|$|E
5|$|Australia had {{previously}} won {{medals in the}} event, but was not {{regarded as one of}} the favourites for the gold, as the Soviet Union, Great Britain, and Sweden all fielded more decorated swimmers over the component legs of the relay. After the backstroke leg, Australia was in fourth place and more than a second in arrears of the <b>Soviet</b> <b>leaders.</b> However, Evans was the fastest among the breaststrokers and moved the team into second position at the halfway point in the race; and Tonelli, a makeshift butterflyer, completed his leg in a time much faster than his previous best, allowing Australia to keep the Soviet lead reasonable. Australia's anchor swimmer Brooks overtook his more credentialled Soviet counterpart Sergey Koplyakov in the latter half of the final leg to secure a narrow victory. The quartet disbanded after the Olympics due to Tonelli's retirement, although some of the members continued to be present in the relay team at various times alongside new swimmers. By 1986, all four members of the 1980 team had retired from international competition.|$|E

5|$|By 1985, {{international}} {{isolation and}} economic hardships had forced Vietnam to rely {{more and more}} on the Soviet Union for help. During the Chinese invasion in February 1979, the Soviet Union provided $1.4 billion worth of military aid to Vietnam, a figure that peaked at $1.7 billion in the period between 1981 and 1985. Then, to help Vietnam implement its third Five Year Plan (1981–1985), the Soviet Union provided a sum of $5.4 billion to the Vietnamese Government for its expenditures; economic aid ultimately reached $1.8 billion annually. The Soviet Union also provided 90 percent of Vietnam’s demand for raw materials and 70 percent of its grain imports. Even though the figures suggest the Soviet Union was a reliable ally, privately <b>Soviet</b> <b>leaders</b> were dissatisfied with Hanoi's handling of the stalemate in Kampuchea and resented the burden of their aid program to Vietnam as their own country was undergoing economic reforms. In 1986, the Soviet Government announced that it would reduce aid to friendly nations; for Vietnam, those reductions meant the loss of 20 percent of its economic aid and one-third of its military aid.|$|E
5|$|Podgorny's {{life after}} his {{resignation}} {{is not well}} documented. The last mention of him in any major Soviet media was his meeting with Urho Kekkonen, the President of Finland. There was never any explanation given, nor a denunciation of him, by the Soviet authorities. Podgorny retained his seat in the Supreme Soviet after his downfall. He was seen at the 61st anniversary reception of the October Revolution at the Grand Palace of the Kremlin in November 1978 by Tokichiro Uomoto, the Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union. Podgorny spoke to Brezhnev, Kosygin, and then to Andrei Gromyko, all of whom looked embarrassed {{by the presence of}} Podgorny, according to Uomoto. Soon after this incident, Podgorny lost his seat in the Supreme Soviet. In Tretyakov Gallery, Podgorny was removed from the 1977 painting of the <b>Soviet</b> <b>leaders</b> at the Red Square by Dmitriy Nalbandyan in which Podgorny stood between Brezhnev and Kosygin. Podgorny died of cancer on 12 January 1983, and was buried in Moscow at the Novodevichy cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Realizing {{the need}} for new leadership, in {{what became known as the}} Polish October, the Politburo chose Gomułka, who had been {{released}} from prison and reinstated in the party, and the Central Committee's 8th Plenum elected him without a Soviet approval the new first secretary of the PZPR. Subsequently, Gomułka convinced the <b>Soviet</b> <b>leaders</b> that he would preserve the Soviet influence in Poland. Gomułka's elevation was preceded by ominous Soviet military moves and an arrival of Soviet high-level delegation led by Khrushchev, which flew into Warsaw to witness and influence the upheaval in the Polish party. After the sometimes confrontational encounters and negotiations, they soon returned to Moscow, where the Soviet leader announced on 21 October that the idea of an armed intervention in Poland should be abandoned. This position was soon reinforced by the pressure from communist China, which expressed its great power aspirations and demanded that the Soviets leave the new Polish leadership alone. On 21 October in Warsaw Gomułka's return to power was accomplished, giving rise to the era of national communism in Poland. Gomułka pledged to dismantle Stalinism and in his acceptance speech raised numerous social democratic-sounding reformist ideas, giving hope to the left-wing revisionists and others in Polish society that the communist state was, after all, reformable. The revisionists replaced and claimed to represent the worker movement, recently defeated in Poznań. The main goals in pursuit of which they engaged were political freedom and self-management in state enterprises. However, the end of Soviet influence in Eastern Europe was nowhere in sight. On 14 May 1955, the Warsaw Pact was signed in the Polish capital, to counteract the earlier establishment of NATO.|$|E
