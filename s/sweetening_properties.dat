40|$|The {{increasing}} {{public awareness}} of adverse health impacts from excessive sugar consumption has created increasing interest in plant-derived, natural low-calorie or zero-calorie sweeteners. Two plant species which contain natural sweeteners, Stevia rebaudiana and Siraitia grosvenorii, have been extensively profiled to identify molecules with high intensity <b>sweetening</b> <b>properties.</b> However, sweetening ability does not necessarily make a product viable for commercial applications. Some criteria for product success are proposed to identify which targets {{are likely to be}} accepted by consumers. Limitations of plant-based production are discussed, and a case is put forward for the necessity of biotechnological production methods such as plant cell culture or microbial fermentation to meet needs for commercial-scale production of natural sweeteners...|$|E
40|$|Erythritol (1, 2, 3, 4 -butanetetrol) is a four-carbon {{sugar alcohol}} with <b>sweetening</b> <b>properties</b> {{that is used}} by the agrofood {{industry}} as a food additive. In this study, we demonstrated that metabolic engineering can be used to improve the production of erythritol from glycerol in the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica. The best results were obtained using a mutant that overexpressed GUT 1 and TKL 1, which encode a glycerol kinase and a transketolase, respectively, and in which EYK 1, which encodes erythrulose kinase, was disrupted; the latter enzyme is involved in an early step of erythritol catabolism. In this strain, erythritol productivity was 75 % higher than in the wild type; furthermore, the culturing time needed to achieve maximum concentration was reduced by 40 %. An additional advantage is that the strain was unable to consume the erythritol it had created, further increasing the process's efficiency. The erythritol productivity values we obtained here are among the highest reported thus far. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Erythritol is a four-carbon {{sugar alcohol}} {{synthesized}} by osmophilic yeasts, such as Yarrowia lipolytica, {{in response to}} osmotic stress. This metabolite has application as food additive due to its <b>sweetening</b> <b>properties.</b> Although Y. lipolytica can produce erythritol {{at a high level}} from glycerol, it is also able to consume it as carbon source. This ability negatively affects erythritol productivity and represents a serious drawback for the development of an efficient erythritol production process. In this study, we have isolated by insertion mutagenesis a Y. lipolytica mutant unable to grow on erythritol. Genomic characterization of the latter highlighted that the mutant phenotype {{is directly related to the}} disruption of the YALI 0 F 01606 g gene. Several experimental evidences suggested that the identified gene, renamed EYK 1, encodes an erythrulose kinase. The mutant strain showed an enhanced capacity to produce erythritol as compared to the wild-type strain. Moreover, in specific experimental conditions, it is also able to convert erythritol to erythrulose, another compound of biotechnological interest. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|Isocoumarins are {{secondary}} metabolites of diversified distribution from {{plant to}} fungi and animal kingdom, showing interesting biological activities. Their analogues, 3, 4 -dihydroisocoumarins (DHICs), {{are a small}} group of derivatives of limited distribution. The structures of natural DHIC are extremely variable due to the different types of substitution in their basic skeleton and this variability influences deeply their biological activities. DHICs exhibit important biological and pharmacological properties such as antimicrobial, anticancer, insecticidal, antimalarial, and antioxidant activities. In particular, DHIC attract the attention for their bitter or sweet taste since some of them have a potent <b>sweetening</b> <b>property,</b> 400 - 800 times more potent than sucrose. Beside the beneficial effects of DHIC some of them have been investigated for their high toxicity, such as ochratoxin, and for their allergenic properties. Plants containing DHIC seem to be not systematically related, e. g., Aloe sp. (Xanthorrhoeaceae), Scorzonera sp., Crassocephalum sp. and Tragopogon sp. (Asteraceae), Xyris sp. (Xyridaceae), Daucus sp. and Notopterygium sp. (Apiaceae), Hydrangea sp. (Hydrangeaceae), Polygala sp. (Polygalaceae), Montrouziera sp. and Hypericum sp. (Guttiferae), Kigelia sp. (Bignoniaceae), and Haloxylon sp. (Chenopodiaceae). The aim of this review is to report the DHIC structures isolated in the last 30 years and to construct possible correlations between the species from a taxonomical point of view, outlining their biological propertie...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background MicroRNAs (miRNAs) {{constitute}} {{a family of}} small RNA (sRNA) population that regulates the gene expression and {{plays an important role}} in plant development, metabolism, signal transduction and stress response. Extensive studies on miRNAs have been performed in different plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa etc. and volume of the miRNA database, mirBASE, has been increasing on day to day basis. Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni is an important perennial herb which accumulates high concentrations of diterpene steviol glycosides which contributes to its high indexed <b>sweetening</b> <b>property</b> with no calorific value. Several studies have been carried out for understanding molecular mechanism involved in biosynthesis of these glycosides, however, information about miRNAs has been lacking in S. rebaudiana. Deep sequencing of small RNAs combined with transcriptomic data is a powerful tool for identifying conserved and novel miRNAs irrespective of availability of genome sequence data. Results To identify miRNAs in S. rebaudiana, sRNA library was constructed and sequenced using Illumina genome analyzer II. A total of 30, 472, 534 reads representing 2, 509, 190 distinct sequences were obtained from sRNA library. Based on sequence similarity, we identified 100 miRNAs belonging to 34 highly conserved families. Also, we identified 12 novel miRNAs whose precursors were potentially generated from stevia EST and nucleotide sequences. All novel sequences have not been earlier described in other plant species. Putative target genes were predicted for most conserved and novel miRNAs. The predicted targets are mainly mRNA encoding enzymes regulating essential plant metabolic and signaling pathways. Conclusions This study led to the identification of 34 highly conserved miRNA families and 12 novel potential miRNAs indicating that specific miRNAs exist in stevia species. Our results provided information on stevia miRNAs and their targets building a foundation for future studies to understand their roles in key stevia traits. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Monocytes and macrophages {{are part}} of the {{first-line}} defense against bacterial, fungal, and viral infections during host immune responses; they express high levels of proinflammatory cytokines and cytotoxic molecules, including nitric oxide, reactive oxygen species, and their reaction product peroxynitrite. Peroxynitrite is a short-lived oxidant and a potent inducer of cell death. Honey, in addition to its well-known <b>sweetening</b> <b>properties,</b> is a natural antioxidant that has been used since ancient times in traditional medicine. We examined the ability of Gelam honey, derived from the Gelam tree (Melaleuca spp.), to scavenge peroxynitrite during immune responses mounted in the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264. 7 when stimulated with lipopolysaccharide/ interferon-γ (LPS/IFN-γ) and in LPS-treated rats. Gelam honey significantly improved the viability of LPS/IFN-γ-treated RAW 264. 7 cells and inhibited nitric oxide production—similar to the effects observed with an inhibitor of inducible nitric oxide synthase (1400 W).

Furthermore, honey, but not 1400 W, inhibited peroxynitrite production from the synthetic substrate 3 -morpholinosydnonimine (SIN- 1) and prevented the peroxynitrite-mediated conversion of dihydrorhodamine 123 to its fluorescent oxidation product rhodamine 123. Honey inhibited peroxynitrite synthesis in LPS-treated rats. Thus, honey may attenuate inflammatory responses that lead to cell damage and death, suggesting its therapeutic uses for several inflammatory disorders.

40|$|Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni is {{well known}} because it accumulates, in its leaves, ent-kaurene diterpenoid glycosides, namely steviol glycosides (SVglys), that are non-caloric natural sweeteners, {{possessing}} a 250 - 300 times higher <b>sweetening</b> <b>property</b> than sucrose. Furthermore, stevia leaves contain others important compounds, such are sterols, triterpenoids, essential oils, polyphenols (flavonoids and hydroxycinnamic acids), vitamins, alkaloids, water-soluble chlorophylls, xanthophylls, that can explicate antioxidant and biological activities with potential beneficial effects on human health. In the European market, the introduction of SVglys as food additives, with a purity of more than 95 %, was given {{only at the end}} of 2011, thanks to the positive opinion issued by EFSA, on their safety, raising the acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 4 mg/kg BW/day, expressed as steviol equivalents (Reg. EU 1131 / 2011). Whereas dried stevia leaves approval in Europe must pass through the legislative procedure of the regulation on novel foods (Reg. EU 2283 / 2015). Arbuscolar mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are soil-borne mutualistic fungi belonging to the phylum of Glomeromycota, that can improve plants growth rate, pathogens resistance, water and mineral nutrient uptake. Thus, these soil-dwelling symbiotic microorganisms are useful for agriculture and for cultivation of medicinal plants, stevia included. There is a crescent interesting for AMF, as agro-system providers able to sustain crop productivity and quality. In fact they are efficient when nutrient availability is low and when nutrients are bound to organic matter and soil particles. Especially for phosphorus uptake in low P soil and plants under stressed environments. This thesis aims to evaluate the effect of AMF symbiosis and phosphorus fertilization on stevia plants. Six treatments have been compared in a pot trial, testing three phosphorus doses (0, 25 and 50 mg P 2 O 5 /kg of soil) in plants with and without AMF. Rhizoglomus intraradices has been used as inoculum. Aboveground and belowground samplings have been done at 69, 89 and 123 days after transplanting (DAT) for quantifying root colonization by AMA, the main biometric and productive characteristics, N and P uptake at 123 DAT, SVglys yield and characterization, phenols and flavonoids content, the antioxidant activity assessed by different assay. The results achieved showed as stevia can be successfully colonized by R. intraradices and how both AMF and P fertilization can enhanced the yield and improve phytochemical profile of the stevia leaf extract. AMF symbiosis could represent a valid biofertilization strategy to improve biomass in stevia, even if {{it was not possible to}} define a clear trend for all the analysed parameters...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Nowadays due to {{population}} growth {{and higher levels of}} welfare, one of the main social problems is providing appropriate food resources. In this regard, finding the alternative food resources, improvement of existing technologies and providing new technologies seem inevitable. Although sugar is a very important substance and has special place in household’s basket and economy, the harmful effects of excessive consumption of sugar should not be neglected. Stevia is a plant with a widespread root system which has a couple of years lifetime. The stems of Stevia are brittle and small and produce elliptical leaves. At first the leaves will be dried and then they will be powdered or wetted in the water and will be used for sweetening of beverages, sweet drinks, chewing gums, chocolates, cakes, etc. Stevia is one of 950 genera belonging to the family of Asteraceae plant. Stevia leaves are used for sweetening foods. Sweetness of Stevia comes from the d. terpenoides glycosides that exist {{in different parts of the}} plant. Glycosides are the result of secondary metabolism in the plants. In different components of the Stevia body, there are about 10 major glycoside compositions which the steviozede and Rbadiozide glycosides have more importance in <b>sweetening</b> <b>property</b> of Stevia compared to other sweet glycosides. Nitrogen is considered as one of the key elements in the nutrition of crops and the most important element in limiting the plant growth. Due to increased cation exchange capacity and a high tendency to absorb and retain ammonium, use of clinoptilolite on agricultural lands can have an effective role in reduction of nutrient washing especially nitrogen from soil. Materials and Methods In order to investigate the effect of different levels of nitrogen and natural zeolite on qualitative and quantitative yield of Stevia in Ahvaz climate, a trial agricultural research field was selected at the farm of agricultural and natural resources of Ramin Khuzestan in 2012 - 2013. A split plot experiment in a randomized complete block design with 3 replications was conducted. The levels of nitrogen fertilizer (50, 100, 150 and 200 N kg /ha) were applied in the main plots and based on similar studies, the levels of zeolite (including zero, 3 and 6 tons per hectare) were applied in subsidiary plots. Transplants were cultured in 2013 / 3 / 6. Harvest was done after growth and development of plant in 2013 / 6 / 10. In order to determine the performance of harvested plants from each plot, after packaging and label-making, the samples were weighted in order to estimate the wet weight. The samples were dried in an oven at 72 °C for 48 hours and reweighted again, and then the dried matter performance was determined. To measure the percentage of steviozide, leaf samples were collected from each plot and dried in an oven at 70 °C for 48 hours, then they were milled, powdered and half a gram of Stevia leaves powder in 50 ml of 70...|$|R
40|$|Background: Thaumatin is {{a protein}} {{originally}} isolated from an African fruit (the "katemfe"), but various thaumatin-like proteins {{have been found}} in apples, grapes, kiwis and olives, etc. Thaumatin has natural <b>sweetening</b> <b>properties</b> and is about 2000 to 3000 times more potent than sucrose. It is therefore used in the food industry, particularly in the processing of low-calories sweeteners. Recently, thaumatin-like proteins have been described as a new family of allergens. Methods: We report the case of a 44 -year-old woman occupationally exposed to thaumatin, who developed an allergy to it. The first symptom was an urticaria, which she presented two years after the factory she was working in (a sweeteners manufacturer), started to use thaumatin. Later on, she perceived an acute episode of a sensation of lump in the throat, persisting mild dyspnea, dysphonia and cough. Despite normal peak flow values and a normal chest examination, her general practitioner treated her with local corticoids and systemic antihistaminic drugs, which improved the symptoms. As occupational physicians, we were asked about the likelihood of an occupational disease. We visited her working place, and assessed the exposure to thaumatin. We concluded that the probability for a delayed asthma related to a thaumatin exposure was high, despite the lack of an exposure test. Results: The case was submitted to the insurance company as an occupational disease, and was accepted as such. It was therefore decided not to perform the exposure test, given the absence of true benefit for the patient, who was advised to switch job, and to avoid any exposure to thaumatin in the future. A few months later, the symptoms had completely disappeared. Conclusion: Some molecules only used in specific industry sectors, can cause health problems, such as allergy, but also toxic impairments, etc. The occupational physician, trained to find out which products and identify which molecules are involved, can contribute to the diagnosis, and help make possible a safe return to work for the patient...|$|E
