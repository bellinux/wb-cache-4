500|$|A {{large part}} of Archimedes' work in {{engineering}} arose from fulfilling the needs of his home city of Syracuse. The Greek writer Athenaeus of Naucratis described how King Hiero II commissioned Archimedes to design a huge ship, the Syracusia, {{which could be used}} for luxury travel, carrying supplies, and as a naval warship.

According to Athenaeus, it was capable of carrying 600 people and included garden decorations, a gymnasium and a temple dedicated to the goddess Aphrodite among its facilities. Since a ship of this size would leak a considerable amount of water through the hull, the Archimedes' screw was purportedly developed in order to remove the bilge water. Archimedes' machine was a device with a revolving <b>screw-shaped</b> blade inside a cylinder.

In this study, the mechanoregulatory models are applied to simulate the implant osseointegration process in a repeated sampling in vivo bone chamber, placed in a rabbit tibia. This bone chamber provides a mechanically isolated environment to study tissue differentiation around titanium implants loaded in a controlled manner. For {{the purpose of this}} study, bone formation around loaded cylindrical and <b>screw-shaped</b> implants was investigated. Histologically, no {{differences were found between the}} two implant geometries for the global amount of bone formation in the entire chamber. However, a significantly larger amount of bone-to-implant contact was observed for the <b>screw-shaped</b> implant compared to the cylindrical implant. In the simulations, a larger amount of bone was also predicted to be in contact with the <b>screw-shaped</b> implant. However, other experimental observations could not be predicted. The simulation results showed a distribution of cartilage, fibrous tissue and (im) mature bone, depending on the mechanoregulatory model that was applied. In reality, no cartilage was observed. Adaptations to the differentiation models did not lead to a better correlation between experimentally observed and numerically predicted tissue distribution patterns. The hypothesis that the existing mechanoregulatory models were able to predict the patterns of tissue formation in the in vivo bone chamber could not be fully sustained. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|AIM: Tissue {{formation}} at {{the implant}} interface {{is known to}} be sensitive to mechanical stimuli. The aim {{of the study was to}} compare the bone formation around immediately loaded versus unloaded implants in two different implant macro-designs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A repeated sampling bone chamber with a central implant was installed in the tibia of 10 rabbits. Highly controlled loading experiments were designed for a cylindrical (CL) and <b>screw-shaped</b> (SL) implant, while the unloaded <b>screw-shaped</b> (SU) implant served as a control. An F-statistic model with alpha= 5 % determined statistical significance. RESULTS: A significantly higher bone area fraction was observed for SL compared with SU (p< 0. 0001). The mineralized bone fraction was the highest for SL and significantly different from SU (p< 0. 0001). The chance that osteoid- and bone-to-implant contact occurred was the highest for SL and significantly different from SU (p< 0. 0001), but not from CL. When bone-to-implant contact was observed, a loading (SL versus SU: p= 0. 0049) as well as an implant geometry effect (SL versus CL: p= 0. 01) was found, in favour of the SL condition.

40|$|Introduction Replacing lost {{teeth with}} dental {{implants}} is today a reliable treatment method associated with good long-term clinical results. Different surface modifications alter the surface topography at micro- and nanometer level of resolution {{as well as}} chemical properties, which have shown to be of importance for osseointegration. Research {{within the field of}} implantology is still intense and aims at further improving the implant properties to achieve successful treatments for patients with compromised bone as well as developing a surface that provides faster integration to shorten the treatment period. Furthermore, more basic science data is needed to increase our understanding of the mechanisms involved in osseointegration. The significance of the surface topography on the micrometer level for implant integration is well known. However, the knowledge of how and to what extent nanostructures may be of importance in early bonehealing and osseointegration remains to be investigated. Aim The overall aim of this thesis was to describe a technique to characterize commercial oral implants on the nanometer level when nanostructures are applied on a microroughness and to investigate whether or not the nanometer surface roughness was correlated to the more well-known micrometer roughnesss; to study the real-time initial cellular interactions of human osteoblasts and fibroblasts to different implant surfaces with and without a coat of nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite; and to evaluate the early bone response to a nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite coating (nano-HA) applied on smooth cylindrical and moderately rough <b>screw-shaped</b> implants. Materials and Methods Twelve different commercial <b>screw-shaped</b> dental implants with different surface modifications were examined using optical interferometry together with Gaussian digital filters and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Human osteoblasts and fibroblasts were used when investigating the initial cell-surface interaction to different surfaces modifications with optical tweezers (OT) and quartz crystal balance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). To evaluate the effect of nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite (nano-HA) compared to nanosized particles of titanium in early bone response, smooth cylindrical titanium implants with no microroughness were inserted in rabbit tibia. The implant surfaces were examined using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and interferometry. To evaluate the biological response, histological analyses including bone contact (BIC) and bone area (BA), as well as qualitative analysis were performed. Furthermore, <b>screw-shaped</b> sandblasted and acid etched titanium implants coated with nano-HA of different thicknesses and un-coated controls were evaluated in rabbit tibia as well as femur. Interferometry, SEM and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) were used to characterize the implant surface topography and chemical composition. Biomechanical and histological evaluations including BA, newly formed bone and qualitative evaluations were performed. Results The studies showed {{that it is possible to}} characterize the surface nanoroughness of commercially dental implants using interferometry. A 1 x 1 μm Gaussian filter was found useful to identify nanoroughness in terms of height deviation. It was demonstrated that the implants do have distinct roughness on the nanometer level of resolution and that the nanoroughness is not correlated to the microroughness when comparing mean surface roughness (Sa). Significant differences in Sa on the nanometer scale were found among some of the implants investigated. However, to detect specific nanostructures an additional SEM examination is necessary. The results from optical trap experiments showed that both osteoblasts and fibroblasts responded in a similar way towards most of the surfaces. No difference in initial cell attachment could be detected between the surfaces when using the QCM-D technique. A nano-HA coating applied on smooth cylindrical implants did not enhance bone responses in terms of bone contact (BIC) and bone area (BA) values as compared to nano-titania. <b>Screw-shaped</b> sandblasted and acid etched titanium implants with applied nanothick (~ 20 nm) coating of nano-HA with similar Sa values on both micro- and nanometer scale of resolution presented similar removal torque values, BA values and showed similar amounts of newly formed bone as compared to un-coated controls when placed in cortical bone. The same result was demonstrated in trabecular bone with a submicron thick coating of nano-HA onto sandblasted and acid etched <b>screw-shaped</b> implants. Conclusions Within the limits of the studies in this thesis, it was demonstrated that commercially available oral implants do have nanoroughness of various amounts and that the nanoroughness is not correlated to the microroughness. It was demonstrated possible to observe cell attachment using optical trapping and QCM-D, however no obvious differences between the surfaces could be detected. A nano-HA coating applied on cylindrical titanium implants did not enhance early bone response compared to a nano-titania coating when evaluated in cortical bone. Furthermore, sandblasted and acid etched <b>screw-shaped</b> implants with applied coatings of different thicknesses of nano-HA perform similar as un-coated controls when evaluated in cortical and trabecular bone...|$|E

40|$|The use of endosseous oral implants, fixed into bone {{by means}} of direct bone contact, became a {{predictable}} treating modality during the eighties. To obtain osseointegration, an initial uneventful healing period for several months has been recommended for decades. However, patient inconveniences such as a prolonged treatment time are associated with this protocol. Therefore, loading implants immediately or soon after their placement is gaining acceptance among clinicians. It is no longer believed that immediate loading per se leads to fibrous encapsulation of implants. On the contrary, {{a certain amount of}} micro-strain may enhance osseointegration. However, accurate long-term studies for specific clinical conditions are lacking and the healing-loading relations are not yet fully understood either. The overall aim of this thesis was, {{by means of}} animal experimental research, to contribute {{to the understanding of the}} mechanobiology of implants subjected to immediate loading. In Chapter I, a general description of the existing knowledge on load-free implant healing is given. Some basic mechanobiological principles that are thought to guide tissue differentiation are discussed. Then, it is questioned whether healing under load is allowed and to what extent it may promote interfacial bone formation. Because this thesis mainly deals with mechanical bone stimulation through the implant, we further questioned the importance of the implant geometry and surface characteristics for an optimal biomechanical coupling. The rabbit bone chamber methodology, described in chapter II, was developed for investigation of the sensitivity of peri-implant tissue differentiation to well-defined and well-controlled mechanical conditions. The bone chamber primarily consists of dual-structure perforated hollow cylinders with a centrally positioned implant. Via perforations, bone grows into the bone chamber. A loading device allows a controlled mechanical stimulation of the implant. Repeated sampling of the bone chamber allows conducting several experiments within the same animal. A protocol for the quantification of the tissue growth and bone response to implant loading was designed, with assessments of the tissue and bone tissue filling of the chamber, as well as the fraction of (non) -mineralized bone tissue within the chamber and in contact with the implant surface. Chapter III describes the tissue response around immediately loaded and unloaded cylindrical turned implants at two different observation periods. The sensitivity of tissue differentiation and bone healing to the mechanical conditions at the peri-implant site was demonstrated. Implant micro-motion had a significant effect on the bone formation around cylindrical turned implants. Micro-movement up to 50 µm displayed a positive effect on the bone formation in the implant’s surroundings and at its interface. Certain implant designs promote bone formation and osseointegration by providing a favourable local mechanical environment. Threaded-type implants are generally recommended for immediate loading due to their higher resistance to vertical movement and shear forces compared to the cylinder-type implant. In chapter IV, the bone formation around immediately loaded implants was compared to the unloaded control with the implant configuration as independent variable. The findings of the study confirmed that well-controlled immediate implant loading accelerates tissue mineralization at the interface of implants. The <b>screw-shaped</b> implant design promoted osseointegration by rendering a more favourable local mechanical environment for bone formation compared to the cylindrical implant. Corroboration of mechanoregulatory tissue differentiation models by comparison with experimental data is necessary to determine their predictive power. In chapter V, three mechanoregulatory models were applied to simulate the osseointegration process for a loaded <b>screw-shaped</b> and cylindrical implant in the bone chamber and compared both qualitatively and quantitatively with the experimental observations. Histologically, no differences were found between the two implant geometries for the amount of bone formation in a narrow circular zone around the implant, whereas a significantly larger amount of bone-to-implant contact was observed for the <b>screw-shaped</b> implant compared to the cylindrical one. In the simulations, the <b>screw-shaped</b> implants were predicted to give rise to higher bone-to-implant contact incidence. However, other experimental observations could not be predicted for any of the investigated mechanoregulatory models. Mathematical models with implementation of the biological processes observed during peri-implant osteogenesis are missing. Also implant surface characteristics are of special importance for initial osteogenesis. It is generally accepted that roughening an implant surface results in a faster bone formation and in an increased mechanical interlocking. In chapter VI, a turned surface was compared with a roughened one under loaded and unloaded conditions. In unloaded conditions, osseointegration was accelerated at a roughened surface compared with a turned one. In the presence of loading however, the topographic dependency of the osteogenic activity at the interface was overruled by the loading-related bone response. In chapter VII, the effect of various degrees of relative movement (0 – 30 – 90 µm) on the tissue differentiation around a roughened <b>screw-shaped</b> immediately loaded implant was investigated. Again, it was found that controlled micro-motion at the interface did not impair the process of osseointegration. Micro-motion up to 90 µm at the interface of a roughened <b>screw-shaped</b> implant stimulated initial osteogenesis. This thesis has shown the importance of the local mechanical environment on the bone formation at the implant surface. Healing under load is beneficial for the establishment of osseointegration, provided a careful selection of the loading protocol and the implant macro- and micro-design. Future research should consider the cellular and molecular foundation underlying the osseointegration process. This will lead to a better understanding of the mechanism(s) of the bone cell response to mechanical loading in the peri-implant environment.

40|$|A careful {{topographical}} characterization {{is important}} for reliable interpretation {{of the role of}} implant surface roughness in bone incorporation. In this paper, the currently available measuring instruments and evaluation techniques are described and discussed first, than literature on the role of surface roughness for cell and bone tissue reactions in vitro and, with special emphasis, the in vivo studies are reviewed. Finally, the results from a series of the authors own animal studies evaluating <b>screw-shaped</b> implants with different surface roughnesses are summarized. The results demonstrated firmer bone fixation for blasted implants than for turned ones. A blasted surface with an average height deviation (Sa) of 1. 5 µm had a better bone fixation than a blasted surface with an average height deviation (Sa) of 1. 2 µm. A tendency towards more bone in contact and higher removal torques was found for blasted implant surfaces with an average height deviation (Sa) of 1. 2 µm than with blasted surfaces with 2. 2 µm average height deviation (Sa) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to see whether a mathematical model of fracture healing was able to mimic bone formation around an unloaded <b>screw-shaped</b> titanium implant as it is well-believed that both processes exhibit many biological similarities. This model describes the spatio-temporal evolution of cellular activities, ranging from mesenchymal stem cell migration, proliferation, differentiation to bone formation, which are initiated and regulated by the growth factors present at the peri-implant site. For the simulations, a finite volume code was used and adequate initial and boundary conditions were applied. Two sets of analyses have been performed, in which either initial and boundary condition or model parameter values were changed with respect to the fracture healing model parameter values. For a number of combinations, the spatio-temporal evolution of bone density was well-predicted. However reducing cell proliferation rate and increasing osteoblast differentiation and osteogenic growth factor synthesis rates, the simulation results were in agreement with the experimental data.

40|$|A {{series of}} 156 {{consecutive}} fully edentulous patients were rehabilitated {{by means of}} fixed prostheses on either 4 or 6 <b>screw-shaped</b> titanium implants. This retrospective study calculated survival rates for both prostheses and individual implants. Only patients with a 10 -year follow-up were considered. The implant lengths were 10 (90 %) or 7 mm. They were all inserted after pretapping. In the mandible 13 and 59 prostheses were installed on respectively 4 and 6 implants. In the upper jaw the respective numbers were 14 and 70. Both groups (4 versus 6 implants) were age- and gender-matched. A reduced jaw bone volume was the major reason for {{limiting the number of}} implants to 4. Although a tendency existed for an increased failure rate in patients with only 4 implants, the survival rate for both individual implants and prostheses was the same in both groups {{at the end of the}} 10 -year observation period. The present tendency of some clinicians to install as many implants as possible in full edentulism should be seriously questioned. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Clinical data {{indicate}} different medium and long-term outcomes of endosseous implants for different implant configurations {{and in particular}} implant surfaces. The present study compares 2 very similar implant systems but with different surface characteristics in a split-mouth-randomized design. The Astra-Tech (A) system (Astra-Tech AB, Mölndal, Sweden) consisted of selftapping TiO 2 -blasted <b>screw-shaped</b> implants made of commercially pure titanium, and the Brånemark (B) System (Nobel Biocare, Gothenburg, Sweden) comprised selftapping Mark II implants with machined surface irregularities. Throughout the 2 -years' observation period, no significant differences could be found concerning probing depths, presence of plaque or change in marginal bone level. A statistically significant difference in location of the marginal bone level {{in relation to the}} shoulder of the implant was found in favor of the A system both at baseline and after 2 years. Cumulative success rates of 100 % (A) and 97. 7 % (B) were not statistically different. From a prosthetic point of view, more soldering points were needed for A compared to B to reach clinical acceptable fit. More years of observation are needed to compare the fate of the soft and hard tissues surrounding two different implant surfaces. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Alveloar {{ridges of}} limited {{dimensions}} could preclude {{the placement of}} dental implants of the regular dimension. Smaller diameter implants - narrow platform (NP) implants were commercially available to address this issue. The aim {{of the study was}} to determine the 5 -year clinical performance of 3. 3 mm diameter NP implants. Twenty-three machined <b>screw-shaped</b> NP implants were placed in nine patients (six males; three females) between 18 and 70 years of age. Clinical and radiographic examinations were performed annually for 5 years. Recognized implant success criteria was used. The criteria were based on the mean marginal alveolar bone loss, the placement of prosthesis of satisfactory appearance, and the absence of implant mobility, peri-implant radiolucency, pain, discomfort or infection. One implant failed at abutment connection. The remaining 22 implants were restored and functioned successfully according to the criteria. The mean marginal alveolar bone loss during the first year was 0. 41 ± 0. 17 mm. The mean marginal alveolar bone loss between the second and fifth year was 0. 03 ± 0. 06 mm. The success rate of NP implants according to a well-established set of criteria was 96 %. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Because of the {{frequent}} lack of bone in the posterior maxilla, sinus augmentation {{has become a}} commonly practiced treatment modality. Many different materials {{have been used for}} augmenting the sinus, and the ideal graft is yet to be found. The present article reports the results of sinuses grafted with calcium sulfate in 2 patients. Bone biopsies were harvested 9 months after the augmentation procedure. In the first patient, 3 titanium threaded-cylinder implants were placed in the grafted area after 9 months, while in the second, 1 acid-etched, <b>screw-shaped</b> titanium implant was placed simultaneously with the graft. Light microscopic evaluation revealed new bone formation with ongoing remodeling and progressive lamellar maturation in the specimens. No remnants of the alloplastic material were detectable in any section, either within the bone or in the medullary tissue. When reevaluated at the uncovering procedure, the implants were radiographically and clinically judged to be osseointegrated. These observations suggest that, when used in the appropriate form and with the proper technique, calcium sulfate is a promising graft material for sinus augmentation, producing adequate quantity and quality of new bone for implant placement.

40|$|This study {{involved}} 108 patients (age 38 - 82 years) rehabilitated with overdentures {{in the lower}} jaw supported by 2 endosseous <b>screw-shaped</b> implants. At each follow-up visit, the clinical attachment level (PAL) around the implants was assessed with a Merrit-B probe or a constant force electronic probe, Peri-probe, and biannually parallel long-cone radiographs were taken to locate the marginal bone level. These data were {{used to examine the}} relationship between bone and attachment level estimations around implants. As a mean, bone level and PAL, for mesial and distal sites, was 0. 67 and 0. 61 for the Merrit-B probe, and 0. 76 and 0. 65, respectively for the Peri-probe. The highest correlations were obtained for sites with a healthy gingiva or in absence of intra-bony craters. Duplicate PAL registrations showed a standard deviation for the intra-examiner variability of 2. 37 (Peri-probe) or 0. 40 mm (Merrit-B probe) with more than 90 % of the variation within 0. 5 mm. The mean difference in PAL between Merrit-B probe or Peri-probe was 0. 05 mm. It was concluded that the clinical attachment level determination is a reliable indicator for bone level around implants with a moderate healthy gingiva. status: publishe...|$|E
