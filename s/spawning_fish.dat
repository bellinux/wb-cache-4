25|$|Internally, {{the sexes}} of most marine animals can be {{determined}} {{by looking at the}} gonads. For example, male testes of <b>spawning</b> <b>fish</b> are smooth and white and account for up to 12% of the mass of the fish, while female ovaries are granular and orange or yellow, accounting for up to 70% of the fish's mass. Male lampreys, hagfish and salmon discharge their sperm into the body cavity where it is expelled through pores in the abdomen. Male sharks and rays can pass sperm along a duct into a seminal vesicle, where they store it for a while before it is expelled, while teleosts usually employ separate sperm ducts.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{its great}} height, Shoshone Falls {{is a total}} barrier to the {{upstream}} movement of fish. Anadromous fish (which live in the ocean as adults, but return to fresh water to lay eggs) such as salmon and steelhead/rainbow trout, and other migratory fish such as sturgeon, cannot pass the falls. Prior {{to the construction of}} many dams on the Snake River below Shoshone Falls, <b>spawning</b> <b>fish</b> would congregate in great numbers {{at the base of the}} falls, where they were a major food source for local Native Americans. Yellowstone cutthroat trout lived above the falls in the same ecological niche as rainbow trout below it, although their range has decreased since the 19th century due to river diversions and competition from introduced species such as lake trout. Due to this marked difference, the World Wide Fund for Nature uses Shoshone Falls as the boundary between the Upper Snake and the Columbia Unglaciated freshwater ecoregions. The Snake River above Shoshone Falls shares only 35percent of its fish species with those of the lower Snake River below the falls. Fourteen fish species found in the upper Snake are also found in the Bonneville freshwater ecoregion (which covers the Great Basin portion of Utah), but not the lower Snake or Columbia rivers. The upper Snake River is also high in freshwater mollusk endemism (such as snails and clams).|$|E

2500|$|In {{an effort}} to improve {{conditions}} for migrating fish, a £485,000 scheme to create a [...] bypass around the weirs at Arborfield was implemented in 2010. It was a joint project between the Environment Agency, Thames Water, the University of Reading, the Farley Estate and Arborfield Angling Society, created to meet {{the provisions of the}} Water Framework Directive. The channel provides a range of habitats, including a [...] stretch which is suitable for <b>spawning</b> <b>fish</b> to lay their eggs, and is expected to be of benefit to salmon, sea trout, eels and barbel. The first phase of the project, which involved repairs to four of the five weir structures at Arborfield, was designed to create lower water levels on the [...] section above the mill site, {{to reduce the risk of}} flooding. Cain Bio-Engineering carried out the construction work, and the project is expected to become a benchmark for such schemes.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{effect of}} damming was the {{creation}} of Lake Aldwell and Lake Mills. [...] These lakes had a multitude of impacts on the river beyond sediment retention. [...] Because the water stayed in the lake for so long, it warmed up to approximately 16°C. [...] Normal water temperatures are around 0°C. [...] These higher temperatures are unnatural for <b>spawning</b> <b>fish,</b> which prefer colder ocean temperature waters. [...] This increase in temperature also increases parasite populations. [...] Disease was known to wipe out two thirds of a spawning population, before it had a chance to spawn. [...] The lakes also acted as buffers for high and low flow conditions. [...] While the dams were not actively used for flood control, the reservoirs behind them altered the natural flow patterns of the river. [...] The normal seasonal high and low flow were evened out by the reservoirs and dams so that flow was relatively constant throughout the year. [...] Natural flow patterns are known to promote the health of native species and to help eliminate non native species after dam removal.|$|E
60|$|December 23.--To add {{for this}} day to the evil thereof, I am obliged to hold a Black-fishing Court at Selkirk. This is always a very unpopular matter {{in one of our}} counties, as the salmon never do get up to the heads of the waters in {{wholesome}} season, and are there in numbers in spawning-time. So that for several years during the late period, the gentry, finding no advantage from preserving the <b>spawning</b> <b>fish,</b> neglected the matter altogether in a kind of dudgeon, and the peasantry laid them waste at their will. As the property is very valuable, the proprietors down the country agreed to afford some additional passage for fish when the river is open, providing they will protect the <b>spawning</b> <b>fish</b> during close-time. A new Act has been passed, with heavy penalties and summary powers of recovery. Some persons are cited under it to-day; and a peculiar licence of poaching having distinguished the district of late years, we shall be likely to have some disturbance. They have been holding a meeting for reform in Selkirk, and {{it will be difficult to}} teach them that this consists in anything else save the privilege of obeying only such laws as please them. We shall see, but I would have counselled the matter to have been delayed for a little season. I shall do my duty, however. Do what is right, come what will.|$|E

6000|$|Probably {{the troops}} who fish our Border-burns still manage to toss out some dozens of tiny fishes, some {{six or eight}} to the pound. Are not these triumphs chronicled in the [...] "Scotsman?" [...] But they cannot imagine what angling was in the dead years, nor what great trout dwelt below the linns of the Crosscleugh burn, beneath the red {{clusters}} of the rowan trees, or {{in the waters of}} the [...] "Little Yarrow" [...] above the Loch of the Lowes. As to the lochs themselves, now that anyone may put a boat on them, now that there is perpetual trolling, as well as fly-fishing, so that every fish knows the lures, the fun is mainly over. In April, no doubt, something may still be done, and in the silver twilights of June, when as you drift on the still surface you hear the constant sweet plash of the rising trout, a few, and these good, may be taken. But the water wants re-stocking, and the burns in winter need watching, in the interests of <b>spawning</b> <b>fish.</b> It is nobody's interest, that I know of, to take trouble and incur expense; and free fishing, by the constitution of the universe, must end in bad fishing or in none at all. The best we can say for it is that vast numbers of persons may, by the still waters of these meres, enjoy the pleasures of hope. Even solitude is no longer {{to be found in the}} scene which Scott, in [...] "Marmion," [...] chooses as of all places the most solitary.|$|E
6000|$|The burns of the Lowlands are {{now almost}} barren of trout. The <b>spawning</b> <b>fish,</b> flabby and useless, are killed in winter. All {{through the rest}} of the year, in the remotest places, {{tourists}} are hard at them with worm. In a small burn a skilled wormer may almost depopulate the pools, and, on the Border, all is fish that comes to the hook; men keep the very fingerlings, on the pretext that they are [...] "so sweet" [...] in the frying-pan. The crowd of anglers in glens which seem not easily accessible is provoking enough. Into the Meggat, a stream which feeds St. Mary's Loch, there flows the Glengaber, or Glencaber burn: the burn of the pine-tree stump. The water runs in deep pools and streams over a blue slatey rock, which contains gold under the sand, in the worn holes and crevices. My friend, Mr. McAllister, the schoolmaster at St. Mary's, tells me that one day, when fish were not rising, he scooped out the gravel of one of these holes with his knife, and found a tiny nugget, after which the gold-hunting fever came on him for a while. But little is got nowadays, though in some earlier period the burn has been diverted from its bed, and the people used solemnly to wash the sand, as in California or Australia. Well, whether in consequence of the gold, as the alchemical philosophers would have held, or not, the trout of the Glengaber burn were good. They were far shorter, thicker and stronger than those of the many neighbouring brooks. I have fished up the burn with fly, when it was very low, hiding carefully behind the boulders, and have been surprised at the size and gameness of the fish. As soon as the fly had touched the brown water, it was sucked down, and there was quite a fierce little fight before the fish came to hand.|$|E

25|$|Spawning {{patterns}} in forage fish are highly predictable. Some fisheries use {{knowledge of these}} patterns to harvest the forage species as they come together to <b>spawn,</b> removing the <b>fish</b> before they have actually <b>spawned.</b> <b>Fishing</b> during <b>spawning</b> periods or at other times when forage fish amass in large numbers {{can also be a}} blow to predators. Many predators, such as whales, tuna and sharks, have evolved to migrate long distances to specific sites for feeding and breeding. Their survival hinges on their finding these forage schools at their feeding grounds. The great ocean predators find that, no matter how they are adapted for speed, size, endurance or stealth, they are on the losing side when faced with the machinery of contemporary industrial fishing.|$|R
