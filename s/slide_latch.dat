5|$|The 767 entered {{service with}} United Airlines on September 8, 1982. The aircraft's first {{commercial}} flight used a JT9D-powered 767-200 on the Chicago-to-Denver route. The CF6-powered 767-200 commenced service {{three months later}} with Delta Air Lines. Upon delivery, early 767s were mainly deployed on domestic routes, including US transcontinental services. American Airlines and TWA began flying the 767-200 in late 1982, while Air Canada, China Airlines, and El Al began operating the aircraft in 1983. The aircraft's introduction was relatively smooth, with few operational glitches and greater dispatch reliability than prior jetliners. In its first year, the 767 logged a 96.1percent dispatch rate, which exceeded the industry average for new aircraft. Operators reported generally favorable ratings for the twinjet's sound levels, interior comfort, and economic performance. Resolved issues were minor and included the recalibration of a leading edge sensor to prevent false readings, the replacement of an evacuation <b>slide</b> <b>latch,</b> and the repair of a tailplane pivot to match production specifications.|$|E
5000|$|The Attachment Unit Interfaces {{that were}} used with 10BASE5 [...] "thick net" [...] in the 1980s and 1990s used DA15 {{connectors}} for connectivity between the Medium Attachment Units and (Ethernet) network interface cards, albeit with a <b>sliding</b> <b>latch</b> to lock the connectors together {{instead of the usual}} hex studs with threaded holes. The <b>sliding</b> <b>latch</b> was intended to be quicker to engage and disengage and to work in places where jackscrews could not be used for reasons of component shape.|$|R
5000|$|The Colt Model 1889 was {{the first}} {{double-action}} revolver with a swing-out cylinder, released by a <b>sliding</b> <b>latch.</b> This design had two advantages over previous designs, since it enabled fast loading but also maintained {{the strength of a}} solid frame. The Model 1889 was chambered for the [...]41 Long Colt, [...]38 Long Colt and [...]38 Short Colt cartridges.|$|R
40|$|Tool {{designed}} {{to be part of}} end effector of robot retracted when not in use to provide clear workspace. Built-in springs extend tool to working position. When tool no longer needed, telescoping assembly compressed until conical head on inner end of tool bit engages lip of <b>sliding</b> block, <b>latching</b> tool in retracted position...|$|R
5000|$|ETRS: A {{modification}} introduced July 1982, ETRS {{production discontinued}} September 1989. Unnamed change to original ETRS model. Lens release <b>sliding</b> lever <b>latch</b> located to {{left side of}} camera side panel, film-backs released using two independent tabs. This version is reputedly {{referred to as the}} [...] "plastic" [...] body ETRS and film-back, for the change in the side panels of the body and film-backs to polycarbonate.|$|R
40|$|Occupants {{exposed to}} {{far-side}} crashes are those {{seated on the}} side of the vehicle opposite the struck side. This study uses the NASS/CDS 1988 - 98 to determine distributions of serious injuries among restrained occupants exposed to far-side crashes and the sources of the injuries. Vehicle-to-vehicle crash tests were conducted to study dummy kinematics. The NASS/CDS indicated that the head accounted for 45 % of the MAIS 4 + injuries in far-side collisions and the chest/abdomen accounted for 39 %. The opposite-side interior was the most frequent contact associated with driver AIS 3 + injuries (26. 9 %). The safety belt was second, accounting for 20. 8 %. Vehicle-to-vehicle side impact tests with a 60 degree crash vector indicated that different safety belt designs resulted in different amounts of head excursion for the far side Hybrid III dummy. For all three point belt systems tested, the shoulder belt was ineffective in preventing large amounts of head excursion. Restraint was achieved by the lap belt loading the abdomen. A single retractor design with low friction <b>sliding</b> <b>latch</b> plate permitted the greatest head excursion in the far side crash tests. A dual retractor system with a fixed latch plate permitted the least...|$|R
25|$|The {{inflated}} {{escape slide}} blocked both forward doors from {{being used to}} evacuate the aircraft, and prevented two flight attendants seated on the forward jumpseat from assisting the evacuation. There was no fire, but had there been a fire, this malfunctioning slide would have dramatically affected the survivability of the occupants. As {{a result of this}} occurrence, the NTSB issued a safety recommendation to replace the <b>slide</b> cover <b>latch</b> brackets on forward slide compartments of all older Boeing 737 models with the latch brackets installed on later models.|$|R
5000|$|The COP [...]357 {{is quite}} robust {{in design and}} construction. It is made of solid {{stainless}} steel components. Cartridges are loaded into the four separate chambers by <b>sliding</b> a <b>latch</b> that [...] "pops-up" [...] the barrel for loading purposes, similar to top-break shotguns. Each of the four chambers has its own dedicated firing pin. It uses an internal hammer, which is activated by depressing the trigger to hit a ratcheting/rotating striker that in turn strikes one firing pin at a time. Older [...] "pepperboxes" [...] also used multiple barrels, but the barrels were the part that rotated. The COP [...]357 operates similarly to the Sharps rimfire pepperbox of the 1850s, in that it uses the ratcheting/rotating striker, which is completely internal, to fire each chamber in sequence.|$|R
5000|$|The RVR was {{essentially}} a second generation Mitsubishi Chariot (known in some markets as the Space Wagon) with a shortened chassis and sharing {{the components of the}} longer vehicle. It is a tall wagon SUV with two rows of seats, equipped with a sliding door on the passenger side, similar to the Toyota Raum and Nissan Prairie. There was no door for the rear passengers on the driver's side; only one sliding door was installed on the passenger side for all trim levels, and for all vehiches sold internationally. This was a different configuration from the larger Chariot in that the longer vehicle had conventional doors {{on both sides of the}} vehicle. Also, the Mitsubishi <b>sliding</b> door <b>latched</b> to a [...] "B" [...] pillar, whereas those of the Toyota and Nissan vehicles did not. The rear windows didn't retract into the doors or body, instead they popped out at the back edge of the window. The rear windows on the longer Chariot did retract into the doors.|$|R
5000|$|With a few ex-Challenge {{employees}} Schrade {{formed a}} second company, the Geo. Schrade Knife Company, primarily to manufacture his Presto series of switchblade knives. In 1937, Schrade {{came out with}} two more low-cost switchblade knives designed to appeal to youth, the Flying Jack and the Pull-Ball Knife. The Flying Jack had a <b>sliding</b> operating <b>latch</b> and could be produced {{with one or more}} automatically opening blades. The Pull-Ball opened by pulling a ball located on the butt end of the handle. Schrade would later manufacture alternative configurations to the ball operating handle, including dice, rings, eight balls, or different colors. Unfortunately, the Pull-Ball required two hands to open, removing much of the switchblade's utility as a one-handed knife. As the blade catch mechanism required a good deal of space within the handle, the knife's blade length was short relative to its handle length. Schrade manufactured many pull-ball knives for sale under other brands, including Remington, Case, and the [...] "J.C.N. Co." [...] (Jewelry Cutlery Novelty Company of North Attleboro, Massachusetts) Always looking for a new way to appeal to customers, Schrade continued to experiment with new forms of switchblade designs up to {{the time of his death}} in 1940.|$|R
40|$|From {{the dawn}} of modern neural network theory, the {{mammalian}} cerebellum has been a favored object of mathematical modeling studies. Early studies focused on the fan-out, convergence, thresholding, and learned weighting of perceptual-motor signals within the cerebellar cortex. This led in the proposals of Albus (1971; 1975) and Marr (1969) to the still viable idea that the granule cell stage in the cerebellar cortex performs a sparse expansive recoding of the time-varying input vector. This recoding reveals and emphasizes combinations (of input state variables) in a distributed representation {{that serves as a}} basis for the learned, state-dependent control actions engendered by cerebellar outputs to movement related centers. Although well-grounded as such, this perspective seriously underestimates the intelligence of the cerebellar cortex. Context and state information arises asynchronously due to the heterogeneity of sources that contribute signals to compose the cerebellar input vector. These sources include radically different sensory systems - vision, kinesthesia, touch, balance and audition - as well as many stages of the motor output channel. To make optimal use of available signals, the cerebellum must be able to sift the evolving state representation for the most reliable predictors of the need for control actions, and to use those predictors even if they appear only transiently and well in advance of the optimal time for initiating the control action. Such a cerebellar adaptive timing competence has recently been experimentally verified (Perrett, Ruiz, & Mauk, 1993). This paper proposes a modification to prior, population, models for cerebellar adaptive timing and sequencing. Since it replaces a population with a single clement, the proposed Recurrent <b>Slide</b> and <b>Latch</b> (RSL) model is in one sense maximally efficient, and therefore optimal from the perspective of scalability.
