5|$|Silicon carbide is a {{semiconductor}} {{in research}} and early mass production providing advantages for fast, high-temperature and/or high-voltage devices. The first devices available were Schottky diodes, followed by junction-gate FETs and MOSFETs for high-power switching. Bipolar transistors and thyristors are currently developed. A major problem for SiC commercialization has been the elimination of defects: edge dislocations, screw dislocations (both hollow and closed core), triangular defects and basal plane dislocations. As a result, devices made of SiC crystals initially displayed poor reverse blocking performance though researchers have been tentatively finding solutions to improve the breakdown performance. Apart from crystal quality, problems with the interface of SiC with silicon dioxide have hampered the development of SiC-based power MOSFETs and insulated-gate bipolar transistors. Although the mechanism is still unclear, nitridation has dramatically reduced the defects causing the interface problems. In 2008, the first commercial JFETs rated at 1200 V {{were introduced to the}} market, followed in 2011 by the first commercial MOSFETs rated at 1200 V. Beside SiC <b>switches</b> <b>and</b> SiC Schottky diodes (also Schottky barrier diode, SBD) in the popular TO-247 and TO-220 packages, companies started even earlier to implement the bare chips into their power electronic modules. SiC SBD diodes found wide market spread being used in PFC circuits and IGBT power modules.|$|E

5|$|Donkey Kong 64 is a 3D {{platforming}} adventure game {{in which}} the player, as Donkey Kong and his friends, explores an island and collects items to progress through minigames and puzzles. The game follows a traditional storyline for the series: King K. Rool and his reptilian Kremlings invade Donkey Kong's idyllic island and kidnap his friends. After a tutorial, the player embarks as Donkey Kong to rescue them from the kidnappers. While exploring the in-game world and completing puzzle minigames, the player collects bananas; enough of these will grant the player access to boss fights, which, in turn, unlock new in-game worlds. Most of the game's puzzles are simple, and involve rearranging items, manipulating <b>switches</b> <b>and</b> tiles, or matching items as in the game Concentration. Minigames include races, minecart rides, and barrels that shoot the characters as projectiles. There are five such banana-rewarding objectives for each of five playable characters across eight themed worlds—200 goals in total, {{in addition to a}} connecting overworld. Unlike in prior Donkey Kong games, the objectives can be completed in any order. The player can fast travel between sections of the level with designated warp pads, and can swap between characters in designated swap barrels. The player also collects banana coins, which unlock new weapons and abilities, and other collectibles such as weapon ammunition and blueprint puzzle pieces. As in other games by the developer, the player often encounters an impossible situation (e.g., an indestructible object or out-of-reach area) and must eventually backtrack to resolve the impasse after acquiring a new ability.|$|E
5|$|The main {{character}} comes {{equipped with a}} staff after {{the initial stages of}} the game, which functions as both a weapon, and a tool for exploration and puzzle-solving. Combat is mainly melee-orientated, with players locking-on to an enemy upon moving in close. Once in combat, an enemy's health is displayed as a heart icon above them, with players able to strafe and roll around a target to dodge attack, while using the staff to either block incoming strikes, or attack an enemy. As a tool, the staff can be used to open containers, operate mechanisms, or lift up stones to uncover hidden caves and boulders to find items. As the player progress in the story, the staff can be upgraded with powers that can help in combat or assist in solving puzzles and exploring locations, including the ability to fire projectiles at enemies or trigger <b>switches,</b> <b>and</b> a special jump ability to reach places that are inaccessible through normal methods. However, using such powers requires magical energy, which the player can recover by retrieving special crystals from the environment. Along with the staff, the player can also has a sidekick that joins them after a certain stage of the story, who can help by finding them items and using certain abilities to open up new areas. Such abilities, referred to as tricks, require the player to feed them with special mushrooms, with each one constituting one trick that can be performed, with the sidekick able to perform a maximum of six tricks when fully fed before needing more mushrooms. The game's inventory system focuses on three areas - items, staff powers, and tricks - with the player able to use three scanner systems in the game - a mini-map of a region (provided a map has been purchased first), a scanner to give information on objects in that are approached, and a fuel cell radar.|$|E

40|$|Through this research, the {{researcher}} study about {{the phenomenon of}} code <b>switching</b> <b>and</b> code mixing used by English teachers to their students in class activities. There are several reasons why researcher chooses English teachers as {{the subject of the}} study.

Secondly, the phenomenon of code <b>switching</b> <b>and</b> code mixing that happens in SMPN 40 Surabaya was not observed before by English department student, in fact it frequently happens both intentionally and unintentionally. Moreover, researcher is also curious about the reason why the teachers use code <b>switching</b> <b>and</b> code mixing in the teaching learning process in the class. The result of the research shows that there were some types of code <b>switching</b> <b>and</b> code mixing which were used by teachers in a class.

The objectives of this study are to find out (1) the types of code <b>switching</b> <b>and</b> code mixing in Indonesian television advertisements, (2) the reasons of using code <b>switching</b> <b>and</b> code mixing, and (3) the contributions of this study to language teaching. This study is a descriptive qualitative study. The researcher observed and collected the advertisements from the non civil national television. The total number of the data is 74 utterances from 63 kinds of advertisements. After being documented, the researcher classified them based on the types of code <b>switching</b> <b>and</b> code mixing and explained the reasons why the code <b>switching</b> <b>and</b> code mixing were used. The last step was identifying the contributions of this study to language teaching. The findings of the analysis are as follow. First, there are three types of code switching found in the seven non civil national televisions. They are intra sentential switching (9), inter sentential <b>switching</b> (15), <b>and</b> tag <b>switching</b> (3). While the types of code mixing are intra sentential mixing (45), involving a change (1), and intra lexical mixing (1). Second, there are seven reasons why code <b>switching</b> <b>and</b> code mixing were used in the television advertisements. Those are talking about topic (3), express solidarity (2), interjection (6), repetition (19), intention of clarifying the speech of content (10), expressing group identity (4), to soften or strengthen request (7), and because real lexical need (27). Third, this study has some contributions to language teaching: (1) this study becomes one of examples of language teaching for example teacher can formulate code <b>switching</b> <b>and</b> code mixing instructions in teaching advertisements through four aspect of language skill, (2) this study could build up a system of language teaching and elaborate teaching and learning material for being used in second language teaching classes, (3) the teachers’ code <b>switching</b> <b>and</b> code mixing is important in a providing psychologically conducive learning environment for the learners, (4) this study gives pedagogical implication: increasing students’ inclusion, participation and understanding in language learning process, conveying ideas more easily and accomplishing lessons...|$|R
