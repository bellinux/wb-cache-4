In 1980, he moved to Delft to become the 4th Professor of Microbiology (succeeding M.W. Beijerinck and A.J. Kluyver) at Delft University of Technology. Kuenen's initial research interests were (the application of) bacteria involved in the natural sulfur cycle and yeast physiology and metabolism. His later interest in the (eco)physiology of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria has led a.o. to the discovery of the bacteria within the phylum planctomycetes that perform the Anammox process.

40|$|International audienceTiming the {{appearance}} of photosynthetic microorganisms is crucial to understanding the evolution of life on Earth. The ability of the biosphere to use sunlight {{as a source of}} energy (photoautotrophy) would have been essential for increasing biomass and for increasing the biogeochemical capacity of all prokaryotes across the range of redox reactions that support life. Typical proxies for photosynthesis in the rock record include features, such as a mat-like, laminated morphology (stratiform, domical, conical) often associated with bulk geochemical signatures, such as calcification, and a fractionated carbon isotope signature. However, to date, in situ, calcification related to photosynthesis has not been demonstrated in the oldest known microbial mats. We here use in situ nanometer-scale techniques to investigate the structural and compositional architecture in a 3. 3 billion-year (Ga) old microbial biofilm from the Barberton greenstone belt, thus documenting in situ calcification that was most likely related to anoxygenic photosynthesis. The Josefsdal Chert Microbial Biofilm (JCMB) formed in a littoral (photic) environment. It is characterised by a distinct vertical structural and compositional organisation. The lower part is calcified in situ by aragonite, progressing upwards into uncalcified kerogen characterised by up to 1 % sulphur, followed by an upper layer that contains intact filaments at the surface. Crystallites of pseudomorphed pyrite are also associated with the biofilm suggesting calcification related to the activity of heterotrophic <b>sulphur</b> reducing <b>bacteria.</b> In this anoxygenic, nutrient-limited environment, the carbon required by the <b>sulphur</b> reducing <b>bacteria</b> could only have been produced by photoautotrophy.

To test this hypothesis, living and decayed Thiomargarita were compared with Doushantuo fossils and experimental taphonomic pathways were compared with modern embryos. In the fossils, as in eukaryotic cells, subcellular structures are distributed throughout cell volume; in Thiomargarita, a central vacuole encompasses approximately 98 per cent cell volume. Key features of the fossils, including putative lipid vesicles and nuclei, complex envelope ornament, and ornate outer vesicles are incompatible with living and decay morphologies observed in Thiomargarita. Microbial taphonomy of Thiomargarita also differed from that of embryos.

Experiments with chloramphenicol-treated cells (50 pg per ml of cell suspension) indicated that the transport system is constitutive and might be activated by a change in osmotic pressure. The uncouplers carbonyl cyanide rn-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) and carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy) -phenylhydrazone (CCFP) totally blocked uptake at concentrations of 25 p ~ and 100 p ~, respectively. The system was insensitive to the cytochrome oxidase inhibitor sodium azide (1 mM), the respiratory chain inhibitor potassium cyanide (1 mM) and the glycolysis inhibitor iodoacetate (1 mM). The ionophore nigericin (50 p ~) had the greatest inhibitory effect, completely abolishing uptake, while monensin (100 p ~) caused 80 % inhibition. Glycine betaine transport possessed considerable structural specifity: proline betaine was the most effective competitor and trigonelline and dimethylglycine exerted inhibition to a lesser extent. Transport in the dark was at a greatly reduced rate.

40|$|The {{widespread}} evelopment of marcasite inassociation {{with the}} acid environment of brown coal deposits i in striking {{contrast to the}} development of pyrite in marine clays that provided a neutral or alkaline environment, and suggests that the form of ferrous sulphide found in supergene. d. epos[ts is an indicator of the acidiLv or otherwise of the conditions attending its decomposmon. The replacement of humified wood hy " marcasite, with perfect preservation of the wood structure, and the filling of marine shells by pyrite seems best accounted for by the action of <b>sulphur</b> <b>bacteria.</b> If the anaerobic <b>sulphur</b> <b>bacteria</b> that protnote the sulphur cycle under marine conditions are destroyed by an acid environment, it would appear that syn-genetic supergene marcasite isevidence of fresh-water deposition for the containing sediments.

40|$|Natural {{microbial}} {{communities were}} grown anaerobically with steel as the electron source and CO 2 the electron acceptor and carbon source, without organic carbon and typical electron acceptors. The cultures increased corrosion {{by up to}} 45. 5 % compared to sterile controls in two months. Pyrosequencing showed the presence of sulphate reducing <b>bacteria</b> (SRB), <b>sulphur</b> reducing <b>bacteria</b> (S 0 RB) and acetogens likely growing in a syntrophic relationship where SRB extracted electrons from iron, acetogens accepted electrons and reduced CO 2 to acetate, which served as carbon source for SRB and/or S 0 RB.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{systematically}} {{investigated the}} different types of LH 2 produced by Allochromatium (Alc.) vinosum, a photosynthetic purple <b>sulphur</b> <b>bacterium,</b> in response to variations in growth conditions. Three different spectral forms of LH 2 were isolated and purified, the B 800 - 820, B 800 - 840 and B 800 - 850 LH 2 types, all of which exhibit an unusual split 800 peak in their low temperature absorption spectra. However, it is likely that more forms are also present. Relatively more B 800 - 820 and B 800 - 840 are produced under low light conditions, while relatively more B 800 - 850 is produced under high light conditions. Polypeptide compositions of the three different LH 2 types were determined by a combination of HPLC and TOF/MS. The B 800 - 820, B 800 - 840 and B 800 - 850 LH 2 types all have a heterogeneous polypeptide composition, containing multiple types of both α and β polypeptides, and differ in their precise polypeptide composition. They all have a mixed carotenoid composition, containing carotenoids of the spirilloxanthin series. In all cases the most abundant carotenoid is rhodopin; however, there is a shift towards carotenoids with a higher conjugation number in LH 2 complexes produced under low light conditions. CD spectroscopy, together with the polypeptide analysis, demonstrates that these Alc. vinosum LH 2 complexes are more closely related to the LH 2 complex from Phs. molischianum than they are to the LH 2 complexes from Rps. acidophila...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{solubilization}} behavior of the tailings produced by the floatation of a complex low grade phosphate ore. The composition of the tailings was essentially dolomite (52. 04 %) with minor amounts of phosphate, iron and aluminium oxides (10. 4 and 0. 5 % respectively). The presence of these products created uncontrolled land pollution and severely affected groundwater. An initiative has been taken up for utilization of this waste to generate an eco-friendly product. First step towards this panorama is incorporation of suitable microorganisms for the biodegradation of this effluent. <b>Sulphur</b> oxidizing <b>bacteria</b> Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans produces sulphuric acid which neutralizes the dolomitic tailings and convert it into plant available forms. The solubilization activity was tested in sulphur medium with 5, 10, 15 and 20 % concentration of tailings. The solubilization is graded {{on the basis of}} pH, Electrical conductivity (EC), soluble calcium and magnesium and soluble phosphate. The results from ex-situ experiments showed that the treatment with 15 % tailings ended with highest solubilization. The values of pH, EC, soluble calcium and magnesium and soluble phosphate for this treatment were 4. 92, 31. 6 dS/m, 10. 8 mL EDTA and 17. 24 µg/mL respectively. Also, the results proved that <b>sulphur</b> oxidizing <b>bacteria</b> Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans is capable of solubilizing dolomitic tailings from the Jhamarkotra mines. Finally, an important factor taken into account was solubilization of residual phosphate along with dolomite in the tailings. This combined action affects the solubilization behaviour of the residue, which was also showed successfully with the assayed laboratory studies...|$|R
