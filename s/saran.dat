5|$|<b>Saran</b> later {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} that during the shoot at Coorg, the team's day began at 4:30 AM everyday. She visited coffee plantation and black pepper farms to observe the farmers' work for her part. For a few particular scenes, where <b>Saran</b> teaches Nagarjuna some farm chores, the team made a few takes, as Nagajuna, being a quick learner, completed the tasks better than <b>Saran.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gemini was {{formally}} launched on 21 November 2001 at the Hotel Connemara, Chennai {{in the presence}} of celebrities including Rajinikanth (through video conferencing) and Kamal Haasan. The launch function was marked by the submission of the script, songs and lyrics. Principal photography was scheduled to begin in mid-December that year, but commenced slightly earlier. Vikram shot for the film simultaneously with Samurai (2002). When Kalabhavan Mani was hesitant in accepting the film due to other commitments in Malayalam, shooting was re-scheduled to film his scenes first. <b>Saran</b> persuaded Mani to allot dates for twelve days to complete his scenes. Since Mani was a mimicry artist, <b>Saran</b> asked him to exhibit his talents; Mani aped the behaviour of a few animals and <b>Saran</b> chose among them, which were added to the film.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, <b>Saran</b> {{appeared}} in Rowthiram, {{where she worked}} with Tamil actor Jeeva for the first time. The film received fairly low reviews. Although some reviews said that <b>Saran</b> was not given much opportunity to show her acting skills, mainly just adding a romantic touch to a mostly violent film, she was referred to by another as the pivot around which the film revolves. Her performance earned her Best Actress Award at the International Tamil Film Awards. Her only other film in 2011 was a special appearance in a song for the Tamil film Rajapattai.|$|E
5|$|With Vikram cast in {{the title}} role, <b>Saran</b> was searching for a {{newcomer}} to play the female lead role of a Marwari woman. Kiran Rathod {{is a native of}} Rajasthan, the place where the Marwaris originate from. She is a relative of actress Raveena Tandon, whose manager brought Rathod the offer to act in Gemini. <b>Saran</b> was convinced after seeing a photograph of Rathod and cast her; Gemini thus became her debut Tamil film. Malayalam actors Kalabhavan Mani and Murali were approached to play significant roles.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by the film's {{success and}} wide-reaching popularity, <b>Saran</b> remade it in Telugu as Gemeni. It {{is the only}} film <b>Saran</b> made in a {{language}} other than Tamil. The remake starred Venkatesh and Namitha in the lead roles, while Kalabhavan Mani and Murali reprised their roles from the Tamil version. Most of the crew members were retained. Posani Krishna Murali translated the dialogues to Telugu. The soundtrack was composed by R. P. Patnaik, who reused most of the tunes from the original film. Released in October 2002, the film received lukewarm response and failed to repeat {{the success of the}} original. In 2013, a Kannada remake was reported to have been planned with Upendra in the lead, but he dismissed the reports as rumours.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, <b>Saran</b> {{made her}} Malayalam debut with Pokkiri Raja, {{in which she}} {{appeared}} opposite Mammootty and Prithviraj. The film was declared a super hit in the first week, breaking the record in Malayalam cinema for opening week gross income, {{though it was not}} received well critically. It was said of <b>Saran</b> that {{all she had to do}} was look pretty. She then enacted her first lead role in a Telugu film after five years, in the commercially successful action-comedy Don Seenu opposite Ravi Teja, where she plays the sister of a mobster. In the opinion of some critics, she stole the show with her dances and romantic scenes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Saran</b> is a brand {{ambassador}} for the Naandi Foundation, {{and for the}} Save A Child's Heart Foundation (SACH), which works {{for the benefit of}} poor children and people affected by natural calamities.

She regularly participates in carnivals and campaigns that associate with children benefits. She is associated with animal welfare and the Blue Cross of India. She is also associated with an NGO called World Vision that finds parents for deprived kids, and works for Apollo’s RDF to raise funds for underprivileged children.|$|E
5|$|Saran's first {{release of}} 2012 was her second Malayalam project, Casanovva, co-starring Mohanlal and {{directed}} by Rosshan Andrrews. The movie was delayed many times, and it was rumored that <b>Saran</b> would leave the project, but in October 2010, the producer of the film announced that shooting would commence in Dubai with Shriya <b>Saran</b> among the cast. It was released on 26 January. Her next release was in Gali Gali Mein Chor Hai, from director Rumy Jafry, which began shooting in September 2011, and released on 3 February. She then {{was seen in the}} critically average comedic Telugu film Nuvva Nena, with actors Allari Naresh and Sharwanand, followed by Sekhar Kammula's much delayed Life is Beautiful.|$|E
5|$|She {{subsequently}} {{appeared in}} several more Telugu films while making in-roads in the Hindi and Tamil industries.

5|$|Although Aishwarya Rai was Shankar's {{original}} {{choice for}} the female lead in 2001, she declined it owing to a busy schedule {{and was replaced by}} Zinta. When Shankar revived the project with Rajinikanth, contenders for the part included Priyanka Chopra, Deepika Padukone, Shriya <b>Saran</b> and Rai, who was ultimately selected and paid 60million. Rai's voice was dubbed by Savitha Reddy.|$|E
5|$|Her most {{important}} 2009 release was the commercially successful Tamil film Kanthaswamy, alongside Vikram. She earned a nomination at the Vijay Awards. Vikram {{said in an}} interview that her role was on par with his, and she easily stole the show on most occasions. Of her character in the film, <b>Saran</b> said that it was the best she has done so far. Also that year she appeared as the female lead in Thoranai. A reviewer said that her glamour and the songs were the only high points of the film. For Thoranai and Kanthaswamy together, she received her third award win, the Amrita Mathrubhumi Award for Best Actress. She then appeared in another English film, Cooking with Stella, which is a comedy that takes a look at the serious nature of relationships between servants and employers.

5|$|Ileana D'Cruz was {{approached}} {{for the other}} female lead role to be paired with Nagarjuna in early February 2013.

However, Shriya <b>Saran</b> was signed as the other female lead as her fourth collaboration with Nagarjuna.
