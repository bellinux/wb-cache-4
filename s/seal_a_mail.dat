500|$|The first {{item was}} {{ratification}} of an ordinance of secession, which proceeded in short order. [...] Next, {{being unable to}} flesh out a complete constitution and system of laws, the delegates voted that [...] "the Constitution and laws of Kentucky, not inconsistent with the acts of this Convention, {{and the establishment of}} this Government, and the laws which may be enacted by the Governor and Council, shall be the laws of this state." [...] The delegates proposed a provisional government to consist of a legislative council of ten members (one from each Kentucky congressional district); a governor, who had the power to appoint judicial and other officials; a treasurer; and an auditor. [...] The delegates designated Bowling Green (then under the control of Confederate general Albert Sidney Johnston) as the Confederate State capital, but had the foresight to provide for the government to meet anywhere deemed appropriate by the council and governor. [...] The convention adopted <b>a</b> new state <b>seal,</b> <b>an</b> arm wearing <b>mail</b> with <b>a</b> star, extended from a circle of twelve other stars.|$|R
40|$|Objective: Achieving high survey {{participation}} rates among physicians is challenging. We aimed {{to assess the}} effectiveness of response-aiding strategies in a postal survey of 1, 000 randomly selected Australian family physicians (FPs). Study Design and Setting: A two x two randomized controlled trial was undertaken to assess the effectiveness of <b>a</b> <b>mailed</b> vs. faxed prenotification letter and <b>a</b> <b>mailed</b> questionnaire <b>sealed</b> with <b>a</b> label marked attention to doctor vs. a control label. At {{the time of our}} final reminder, we randomized remaining nonresponders to receive a more or less personalized mail-out. Results: Response did not significantly differ among eligible FPs receiving a prenotification letter via mail or fax. However, 25. 6 % of eligible FPs whose questionnaires were <b>sealed</b> with <b>a</b> label marked attention to the doctor responded before reminders were administered and compared with 18. 6 % of FPs whose questionnaires were <b>sealed</b> with <b>a</b> control label (P = 0. 008). Differences were not statistically significant thereafter. There {{was no significant difference in}} response between FPs who received a more vs. less personalized approach at the time of the final reminder (P = 0. 16). Conclusion: Mail marked attention to doctor may usefully increase early response. Prenotification letters delivered via fax are equally effective to those administered by mail and may be cheaper. 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

Mitchell knew confusion with Oregon City would occur, and suggested the name [...] "Oretown" [...] to the postal authorities instead. The name was accepted and Oretown post office ran from 1877 to 1954. Today Oretown has <b>a</b> Cloverdale <b>mailing</b> address.|$|R
50|$|LMTP is {{designed}} {{as an alternative}} to normal SMTP for situations where the receiving side does not have <b>a</b> <b>mail</b> queue, such as <b>a</b> <b>mail</b> storage server acting as <b>a</b> <b>Mail</b> Delivery Agent (MDA). <b>Mail</b> queues are <b>an</b> inherent requisite of SMTP. In situations in which mail queues are not possible, LMTP is desirable, since <b>a</b> <b>mail</b> storage server should manage only its mail store without having to allocate more storage for <b>a</b> <b>mail</b> queue. This is not possible with SMTP when there are multiple recipients for <b>a</b> <b>mail</b> message. SMTP can only indicate successful delivery or failure for all or none of the recipients, creating the need for a separate queue to handle the failed recipients. LMTP, on the other hand, can indicate success or failure to the client for each recipient, allowing the client to handle the queueing instead. The client in this case would typically be <b>an</b> Internet-facing <b>mail</b> gateway. LMTP is not intended for use over wide area networks. In other words, the Message transfer agent (MTA) still handles all outgoing mail, including the mail stream from the LMTP, to another mail server located somewhere on the Internet.|$|R
