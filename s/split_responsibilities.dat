5000|$|Local {{governance}} {{presented a}} new problem. The area was divided among the mainland municipalities {{according to the}} boundaries used when it was water-covered.

As the polder became more populated, the demand for representation increased until finally on July 1, 1941 the municipality of Wieringermeer was established.In the closing days of World War II, the Nazis detonated explosives severely damaging the Wieringermeer dike. No casualties were incurred but the polder sank, and the high water and a subsequent storm destroyed most of the infrastructure built in the previous decade. Reconstruction followed quickly {{and by the end of}} 1945 the polder was declared drained again and rebuilding the roads, bridges, houses and farms was greatly facilitated by the experience of building them the first time.|$|E

40|$|The Canadian Constitution {{is usually}} {{interpreted}} as giving the provinces primary jurisdiction over social welfare. However, {{the federal government}} utilizing other powers provided in the constitution has expanded its role in legitimating the social order by promoting social integration and providing the disadvantaged groups with minimum social security.

40|$|Automatic {{building}} control systems have rapidly evolved from time-based on-off energy management controllers to distributed microprocessor-based {{direct digital control}} (DDC) Building Automation Systems. Precipitous decreases {{in the cost of}} electronic controls have now made it practical and cost effective to install all-electronic controls instead of the traditional electro-pneumatic controllers which had heretofore been standard. The new automatic systems provide benefits in wide operational and management areas far beyond the original energy management application. They should more properly be named "facilities automation" rather than "energy management" systems. The traditional centralized computer systems now in use have some inherent disadvantages: high cost of equipment, long install cycles, complex skills required of operational personnel, <b>split</b> <b>responsibilities</b> between departments at sites, and slow reaction time to changing data. The inherent cost advantages of using multiple microprocessors to accomplish closed loop control, direct digital control, energy management?, and security functions make it necessary that they be included in any new design. This will require that a distributed system be designed and that the present role of the strong central host computer be reduced. This paper will present a proposed design for a comprehensive Facilities Automation System which will utilize IBM Personal Computers (IBMPC's) and vendor microprocessors in stand-alone and distributed configurations. It will suggest a growth path from presently installed systems to newer technology...|$|E

The TX81Z is built around a single FM chip, the Yamaha YM2414B aka OPZ, while 6-op machines like the DX7 have separate envelope/frequency and algorithm/wave chips and created LFOs in software; this large workload in the OPZ is probably why it has fewer operators and notes.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the idea for}} achieving trustworthiness by <b>splitting</b> <b>responsibilities</b> between different parties mutually mistrusting one another. These parties are called mistrust-parties because some kind of mistrust between these parties is actively created to prevent potentially manipulative cooperation. The birth of the S-Network, a universally applicable trustworthy repository, should enable users to make and access reliable publications and secure deposits. The S-Network combines secure long term data storage and preservation in a computer network with non-repudiation and legal validity.

Besides being a potential application, the S-Network could also be used as a tool for vital parts in the measures for creating trust with a set of mistrust-parties described in this paper...|$|R
