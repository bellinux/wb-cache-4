5000|$|Techniques for the {{creation}} of artistamps may include perforating the paper to resemble a traditional perforated stamp, as well as applying gum to the reverse side of the paper. <b>Self-adhesive</b> <b>paper</b> is also used. The image represented on the stamp may be hand-drawn or painted, lithographed or offset-printed, photographed, photocopied, etched, engraved, silk-screened, rubber stamped, or produced on a digital inkjet or laser printer. While the method of production is entirely the choice of the artist, creators who exclusively or primarily use rubber stamps are occasionally held in contempt by members of the artistamp community, some of whom refer to such producers as [...] "bunny-stampers." ...|$|E

Glede na to, da je vinska etiketa obraz vina, je v etiketni industriji pomemben tako oblikovni kot tehnološki vidik grafike. Predvsem pa je v nasičenem trgu pomembna dodana vrednost etikete, ki jo lahko dosežemo z zlato barvo. Primerjali smo kakovost treh tehnologij za reproduciranje zlate barve na samolepilni etiketni papir v zvitku, in sicer klasični vroči zlatotisk ter alternativni tehnologiji, to sta digitalni tisk (elektrofotografija) ter sitotisk. Ugotavljali smo, katera izmed tehnologij omogoča kakovostnejše odtise in je racionalnejša. Na površinsko neobdelanih odtisih testne forme smo izvedli analizo tiskovnega materiala in analizo odtisov. Analiza tiskovnega materiala je pokazala dobro pregibno odpornost uporabljenih etiketnih papirjev in minimalno hrapavost. Analiza odtisov pa je glede na izvedene teste pokazala različne rezultate. Vizualna ocena in slikovna analiza sta pokazali najboljše rezultate pri odtisih, upodobljenih z vročim zlatotiskom in elektrofotografijo. Pri meritvah adhezivnosti in abrazivnosti odtisov se je najbolje izkazal odtis, upodobljen s tehnologijo sitotiska. Po izpostavljenosti odtisov na alkohol je očitna degradacija samo na odtisu, upodobljenim z vročim zlatotiskom. Manjšo deformacijo odtisov pa sta povzročila tudi {{detergent}} in voda, medtem ko olje ni povzročilo očitnih sprememb na odtisih. Ugotovili smo, da je na umetno staranje najmanj odporen odtis, upodobljen s sitotiskom. Globoko zamrzovanje pa je največje spremembe povzročilo na odtisu, upodobljenim z vročim zlatotiskom. Vsi vzorci imajo dobro svetlobno obstojnost. Iz rezultatov meritev smo ugotovili, da lahko digitalna tehnologija vsekakor konkurira vročemu zlatemu tisku pri reprodukciji zlate barve na vinske etikete. Na koncu praktičnega dela smo oblikovali kolekcijo vinskih etiket z zlatimi in srebnimi elementi. Etiketo smo odtisnili z digitalno tehnologijo (elektofotografija). Tisk nam je omogočil tiskalnik Xeikon 3030. Tiskali smo na metaliziran etiketni papir SilverVac. The master 2 ̆ 7 s thesis {{deals with}} the field of reproduction of a golden colour on wine labels. Considering {{the fact that the}} wine label is the face of the wine, the design and the technical aspect of the graphic is important in the labelling industry. Above all, in the saturated market, the added value of the label is important, which can be achieved with a golden colour. We compared the quality of the three technologies for the reproduction of a golden colour on <b>self-adhesive</b> label <b>paper</b> in rolls: classic hot foil stamping and alternative technologies such as digital printing (electrophotography) and screen printing. We have examined which of the technologies enables better quality imprints and is more rational. We analysed the printing material and the imprints on the surface of raw and untreated imprints of the test form. The analysis of the printing material showed good flexural resistance of the used labels and minimal roughness. The analysis of the imprints showed different results according to the tests carried out. Visual evaluation and image analysis showed the best results in the imprints made with hot foil stamping and electrophotography. In the adhesiveness and abrasiveness measurements of the imprints, the imprint illustrated with screen printing technology was the best. After being exposed to alcohol, the obvious degradation is only on the imprint made with hot foil stamping. Minor deformation of the imprints was also caused by detergent and water, while oil did not cause obvious changes. We have found out that the least resistant to artificial aging is imprint made with screen printing. Deep freezing, however, caused the biggest changes on the imprint made with hot foil stamping. All samples have good light resistance. The results showed that digital technology can certainly compete with the hot foil stamping when reproducing a golden colour on wine labels. At the end of the practical work we created a collection of wine labels with golden and silver elements. The label was printed with digital technology (electrophotography). The print was enabled by the Xeikon 3030 printer. We printed on the metallised label paper SilverVac...|$|R

40|$|Knowledge about seed {{dispersal}} {{is required to}} explain problems in ecology, phylogeography, and conservation biology. Even though {{seed dispersal}} is a fundamental mechanism to understand problems {{at different levels of}} biological organization (individual, population, species, landscape), it remains one of the least recognized processes. Similar to other groups of plants, very little is known regarding patterns and distances of seed dispersal in orchids. Orchid seeds are generally assumed to be widely dispersed by wind because of their small size and low weight. Between 2006 and 2008, we conducted a field study of the distances at which orchid seeds are dispersed, and determined factors affecting dispersal. Investigations included 13 populations of six terrestrial orchid species – Cypripedium calceolus, Cephalanthera rubra, Epipactis helleborine, Goodyera repens, Neottia ovata, and Platanthera bifolia. To evaluate seed dispersal in orchid populations, 8. 5 -cm Petri dishes (traps) with <b>self-adhesive</b> <b>paper</b> were placed along transects, starting from a group of fruiting plants, which were considered to be the dispersal source. Seeds of the investigated orchid species were dispersed over relatively short distances. There were statistically significant negative correlations between seed density and distance from the fruiting plants. Seeds of species with taller fruiting shoots were dispersed farther than those with shorter ones (R = 0. 68, p < 0. 05). We discuss the causes and consequences of the dispersal patterns of orchid seeds...|$|E
