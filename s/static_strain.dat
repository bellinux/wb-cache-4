50|$|An {{ultrasonic}} motor {{is a type}} {{of electric}} motor powered by the ultrasonic vibration of a component, the stator, placedagainst another component, the rotor or slider depending on the scheme of operation (rotation or linear translation). Ultrasonic motorsdiffer from piezoelectric actuators in several ways, though both typically use some form of piezoelectric material, most often lead zirconate titanate and occasionally lithium niobate or other single-crystal materials. The most obvious difference is the use of resonance to amplify the vibration of the stator in contact with the rotor in ultrasonic motors. Ultrasonic motors also offer arbitrarily largerotation or sliding distances, while piezoelectric actuators are limited by the <b>static</b> <b>strain</b> that may be induced in the piezoelectric element.|$|E

30|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{we assumed}} a homogeneous elastic half-space in our {{calculation of the}} coseismic <b>static</b> volumetric <b>strain</b> changes. This elastic half-space decreases the coseismic <b>static</b> volumetric <b>strain</b> changes in inverse proportion to the cubic of the hypocentral distance. Since most of the coseismic and/or postseismic groundwater level changes observed in our study were caused by relatively distant earthquakes (Fig. 1; Table 4), it seems natural that those <b>static</b> volumetric <b>strain</b> changes should scarcely {{have an effect on}} the earthquake-related changes (Itaba et al., 2008 a, b). However, the actual crust is inhomogeneous, and it is known that observed coseismic strain changes are often different from those calculated in the same manner. The local strain accumulation due to inhomogeneous structures and its subsequent release by ground shaking is one possible explanation of the difference (Watanabe, 1991). This strain release, which is a type of <b>static</b> volumetric <b>strain</b> change due to the presence of inhomogeneous structures, is another possible causal factor of earthquake-related changes; ground shaking is also important in this context.|$|R

Intermittent straining, i. e., alternating periods of cyclic and <b>static</b> <b>strain,</b> has previously been shown to result in more mature tissue compared with continuous cyclic straining. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism is unknown. We have determined the short-term effects of continuous cyclic strain and of cyclic strain followed by <b>static</b> <b>strain</b> at the gene expression level to improve insight into the mechano-regulatory mechanism of intermittent conditioning on collagen synthesis, remodeling and maturation. Tissue-engineered constructs, consisting of human vascular-derived cells seeded onto rapidly degrading PGA/P 4 HB scaffolds, were conditioned with 4 % strain at 1 Hz for 3 h in order to study the immediate effects of cyclic strain (n= 18). Next, the constructs were either subjected to ongoing cyclic strain (4 % at 1 Hz; n= 9) or to <b>static</b> <b>strain</b> (n= 9). Expression levels of genes involved in collagen synthesis, remodeling and maturation were studied at various time points up to 24 h within each straining protocol. The results indicate that a period of <b>static</b> <b>strain</b> following cyclic strain favors collagen synthesis and remodeling, whereas ongoing cyclic strain shifts this balance toward collagen remodeling and maturation. The data suggest that, with prolonged culture, the conditioning protocol should be changed from intermittent straining to continuous cyclic straining to improve collagen maturation after its synthesis and, hence, the tissue (mechanical) properties...|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{approach for}} genetics based statistical optimization technique {{is used to}} design the smart structural system for aerospace structures. An evolutionary based optimization technique like genetic algorithm (GA) has come into prominence. The reason for developing evolution based algorithm for optimization is for its robustness and randomness. Other numerical tools that are used for optimization are generally gradient based algorithm, where there is possibility of occurrence for a local optimum value. The GA developed is a niche-micro GA, where termination criteria are set in order to restart the algorithm. Stage-wise multiple objective functions and multiple termination criteria are incorporated to improve the computational effort. The current approach is very much robust to design a smart structural system through optimization for its maximum structural performance. In order to achieve maximum structural performance for the smart structural system, {{it is necessary to}} appropriately position the active elements. Here the genetic algorithm is amalgamated with finite element to perform a statistical based optimization to locate the position and size of active structural elements i. e. actuators/sensors. Majorly, nowadays the actuators and sensors that are preferred for smart structures design (i. e. Piezo patches, Piezo composite, SMA wire, SMA composite etc) develop induced strain under an external applied field. It becomes necessary to optimize the smart structures using the following parameters such as <b>static</b> <b>strains,</b> modal dynamic strains, size of the actuators/sensors, induced strain etc. A scaled T-Tail model is taken as an illustration to carry out the GA analysis for the location and sizing of PZT actuator/sensor.

40|$|Abstract. In this work, the {{viscoelastic}} {{behavior of}} open cell polyurethane foams used in noise control applications is investigated through {{dynamic mechanical analysis}} in compression. Several levels of static strains superimposed on a small dynamic one were considered {{in order to assess}} the effect of material non-linearity on the mechanical response. Further, a wide range of frequencies and temperatures was explored. For each <b>static</b> <b>strain</b> a different master curve for conservative component of complex modulus, E’, could be determined. Interestingly, the loss factor was the same at all static strains, indicating that the relative contribution of energy dissipation and conservation is unaffected by the <b>static</b> <b>strain.</b> Moreover, shift factors (and thus the bulk material relaxation times) turned out to be independent on <b>static</b> <b>strain</b> level. These results suggest that the non- linearity of the foam is linked to the change in foam structure with strain rather than to a non-linear behavior of the viscoelastic constituent material. The acoustic performance of the considered materials was modelled for a case study with two approaches: i) standard simulations performed taking a single valued complex modulus, measured at 50 Hz and room temperature or ii) simulations taking into account the complex modulus frequency dependence obtained from the master curves. The transmission loss prediction obtained in the second case is in better agreement with experiments, especially at high frequencies...|$|E
