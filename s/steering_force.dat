50|$|In early 20th century {{automobiles}} {{prior to}} the introduction of power steering, the effect of a flat or blowout on one of the front wheels tended to pull the steering mechanism toward the side with the flat tire. The use of a worm screw reduced this effect. Further worm drive development led to recirculating ball bearings to reduce frictional forces, which transmitted some <b>steering</b> <b>force</b> to the wheel. This aids vehicle control and reduces wear that could cause difficulties in steering precisely.|$|E
50|$|Depending on the driver, <b>steering</b> <b>force</b> and {{transmission}} of road forces {{back to the}} steering wheel and the steering ratio of turns of the steering wheel to turns of the road wheels affect control and awareness. Play—free rotation of the steering wheel before the wheels rotate—is a common problem, especially in older model and worn cars. Another is friction. Rack and pinion steering is generally considered the best type of mechanism for control effectiveness. The linkage also contributes play and friction. Caster—offset of the steering axis from the contact patch—provides some of the self-centering tendency.|$|E

40|$|SummaryFor {{a variety}} of {{problems}} in structural biology, low-resolution maps generated by electron microscopy imaging are often interpreted {{with the help of}} various flexible-fitting computational algorithms. In this work, we systematically analyze the quality of final models of various proteins obtained via molecular dynamics flexible fitting (MDFF) by varying the map-resolution, strength of structural restraints, and the <b>steering</b> <b>forces.</b> We find that MDFF can be extended to understand conformational changes in lower-resolution maps if larger structural restraints and lower <b>steering</b> <b>forces</b> are used to prevent overfitting. We further show that the capabilities of MDFF can be extended by combining it with an enhanced conformational sampling method, temperature-accelerated molecular dynamics (TAMD). Specifically, either TAMD can be used to generate better starting configurations for MDFF fitting or TAMD-assisted MDFF (TAMDFF) can be performed to accelerate conformational search in atomistic simulations...|$|R

5000|$|The fairing on a velomobile {{sometimes}} {{makes it}} more subject to cross-winds than a similar unfaired cycle. The effect of cross-winds is complicated because {{the force of the}} wind can act as a <b>steering</b> <b>force,</b> as-if the rider had tried to steer the cycle. [...] "Wind steer" [...] can be a safety issue and may also hurt performance, as a serpentine path is longer and thus slower than a straight line. Thus, a design with inferior aerodynamics may be better overall. For example, it is common for time-trial bicycles to use a solid disk rear wheel for best aerodynamics, and a spoked front wheel that has worse aerodynamics than a disk, but is less likely to steer the bicycle in a cross-wind. Velomobile fairings have analogous concerns, leading to trade-offs in fairing design. For example, a longer [...] "tail" [...] on the fairing will increase the total side-wind profile and total side forces, but can reduce the percentage force acting on the steered wheels and so an improve stability in side winds. A larger fairing also hurts weight and has more skin drag), but as with time-trial bicycles, worse aerodynamics but better handling is sometimes a good trade-off.|$|E
5000|$|Subaru's system, branded [...] "EyeSight", was {{announced}} in May 2008 using stereo camera technology to detect pedestrians and bicyclists. As initially announced, EyeSight enabled pre-collision braking control and adaptive cruise control at all speeds. It was rolled out in Japan to selected models in 2010; in Australia in 2011; and in North America in 2013 model year Legacy and Outback models.A alarm is used to warn the driver of a potential collision hazard in the pre-collision system. The pre-collision braking control was upgraded in 2010 to allow the vehicle to stop automatically if the speed difference between the EyeSight-equipped vehicle and the object in front is less than [...] and the driver takes no action to slow down or stop. Above , the vehicle will reduce its speed automatically. It also allows the vehicle to engage braking assist {{if there is a}} risk of a frontal collision and the driver suddenly applies the brakes. The speed difference to allow an automatic stop was raised to [...] in 2013 with improved cameras.The adaptive cruise control was also upgraded in 2010 to allow automatic emergency braking in traffic, fully stopping the EyeSight vehicle when the car in front has come to a complete stop. In 2013, color was added to the cameras, allowing the system to recognize brake lights and red stoplights ahead.Subaru also added an active lane-keeping (keeping the vehicle {{in the middle of the}} lane, and applying <b>steering</b> <b>force</b> to keep the vehicle in the lane when unintentionally crossing lane markers) and throttle management (to prevent sudden unintended acceleration in forward and reverse) systems in 2013 with the improved cameras.EyeSight has been very popular, equipped on approximately 90% of all Legacy and Outbacks sold in Japan at the beginning of 2012, and the engineers responsible for its development won a prize from the Japanese government that year.|$|E

5000|$|In former Trim-Tab servo systems, {{the pivot}} {{movement}} of the servo blade around its vertical axis {{has been carried out}} by a trim tab Servo tab, which however costs some force due to the fact, that the trim tab is moved in the opposite direction to turn the servo blade.The same holds for a trim trim tab, which is mounted at a big distance behind the ship's rudder, connected to it at its upper and lower end. This construction is called [...] "The Saye's Rigg". Another version of wind vane self steering on sail boats is known as the vertical axis vane and usually, because of the inferior <b>steering</b> <b>force</b> output compared to Servo Pendulum devices it makes use of a trim tab hung off the rudder to control the course of the boat. The vane spins at right angles to the ground and can lock to the trim tab in any desired position, as the boat falls off the wind the vane will be turned by the wind and will take the trim tab with it which in turn causes the rudder to move in the opposite direction and thus corrects course. Generally self steering like this, with a trim tab can only be used on boats with transom (or aft hung double enders) rudders as the trim tab needs to be mounted directly to and aft of the rudder to produce the desired effect, and of course has to be controlled even as the rudder swings side to side. This is typically accomplished by use of a slotted bar in which the connection to the vane assembly can slide in as the rudder turns. These self steering systems are generally simpler and are thus easier to set and adjust course as they don't make use of lines controlling the rudder but control it more directly through solid linkages.A related device has been used on some windmills, the fantail, a small windmill mounted at right angles to the main sails which automatically turns the heavy cap and main sails into the wind, (invented in England in 1745). (When the wind is already directly into the main vanes, the fantail remains essentially motionless.) ...|$|E
5000|$|The most {{widespread}} form of self-steering, the servo pendulum, {{was introduced}} {{to cope with the}} power required to operate a larger rudder and was a successor to the servo trim tab principle (introduced by Herbert [...] "Blondie" [...] Hasler). Common to all servo pendulum rudder(oar, blade) systems is the fact, that the speed of the boat through the water is used to amplify the small force coming from the wind vane {{in order to be able}} to turn the rudder. The servo blade can be turned in its vertical axis and is hung like a pendulum. When it is turned around its vertical axis, the water flow initiates a sideways force on the blade area, and the forceful swing movement to the side is used to act on a rudder (ship's rudder or auxiliary rudder being integrated in the system).A narrow upright board, the wind vane, is mounted on a nearly horizontal axis carrier that is itself rotated around its vertical axis so that with the boat traveling in the desired direction the vane is vertical and edge-on to the wind. The wind vane is balanced by a small weight below the pivot, but if the boat turns so that the board is no longer edge-on to the wind it will be blown over to one side as the extra surface area is revealed. This movement is transmitted by a series of linkages to a blade (or oar) in the water, so that the oar is turned around its vertical axis, when the wind vane rotates from its neutral position.As the blade described above turns, the pressure of water moving past it causes it to swing out sideways on the end of a pivoted rod. An immersed area of 0.1 m2 at 1 m lever length at a boat speed of 2.5 m/s (about 5 knots) and 5° angle of attack already generates a moment of 180 N⋅m, when the oar has a NACA0012 profile. The <b>steering</b> <b>force</b> of the servo oar is transmitted to the main rudder typically involving an arrangement of two lines and four or more rolls to guide the steering ropes to the helm or the steering wheel.|$|E

In the whole process, a robust algorithm for <b>steering</b> <b>force</b> and pad force is the key factor for achieving the desired control effects.|$|E

If the <b>steering</b> <b>force</b> falls in area 2 (in which there is a pad), then area 2 is the favorable area. In this case, a favorable force should be assigned to pad 2 : F 2 [*]=[*]F f, which gives an additional equation.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} reconstructing the velocities of ocean currents impinging on a towed streamer cable sparsely equipped with steering elements. The study {{is based on a}} two-dimensional model describing the quasi-steady motion of the towed cable in the presence of hydrodynamic drag and <b>steering</b> <b>forces</b> that depend nonlinearly on the angle of attack. To derive the proposed methodology we firstly outline the hydrodynamic equations used in solving the forward problem by which the cable’s velocity, curvature and tension are obtained in the knowledge of the towing vessel’s motion, the ocean current velocities and the drag coefficient characteristics of the steering elements. In sequence we formulate the inverse problem of inferring the ocean velocities using a finite set of noise-infused positioning and tension measurements showing that this is nonlinear and ill-posed. To solve the inverse problem we adopt Newton’s scheme for nonlinear convex problems in conjunction with generalized Tikhonov regularization. The problem under consideration bares significant differences from the linear non-steered formulation addressed in (12), due to the nonlinearity in the forward method as well as the discontinuities observed in the forward measurements due to the <b>steering</b> <b>forces.</b> A series of numerical simulation studies is subsequently presented in order to demonstrate the practical performance of the proposed technique in reconstructing the ocean currents velocity profile and angle of attack. 1.
