2500|$|The use of {{nucleotide}} sequence variations to investigate evolutionary relationships {{is not a}} new concept. Carl Woese used sequence differences in ribosomal RNA (rRNA) to discover archaea, which in turn led to the redrawing of the evolutionary tree, and molecular markers (e.g., allozymes, rDNA, and mtDNA sequences) have been successfully used in molecular systematics for decades. DNA barcoding provides a <b>standardised</b> <b>method</b> for this process via the use of a short DNA sequence from a particular region of the genome to provide a 'barcode' for identifying species. In 2003, Paul D.N. Hebert from the University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada, proposed the compilation of a public library of DNA barcodes that would be linked to named specimens. This library would [...] "provide a new master key for identifying species, one whose power will rise with increased taxon coverage and with faster, cheaper sequencing".|$|E

40|$|The {{goals of}} the present {{publication}} are (a) to identify <b>standardised</b> <b>methods</b> and tools applied in clinical trials and cohort studies to assess key functional aspects in HNC, using the Brief ICF Core Set for head and neck cancer (ICF-HNC) as a reference and (b) to propose a set of sound <b>standardised</b> <b>methods</b> and tools suitable to assess functional problems in HNC. This work contributed {{to the development of}} practical ICF-HNC based guidelines targeting the standardised measurement of functional outcomes in HNC follow-up and clinical research in Germany. A systematic review of randomised and clinical controlled trials, and observational studies in HNC were carried out to identify <b>standardised</b> <b>methods</b> and tools. Suitable methods and tools were then selected based on pre-defined criteria. 210 assessment methods and tools were identified in 136 studies: 146 patients reported outcomes (PRO) and 64 tools rated by health professionals. Altogether 59 tools were considered suitable to be included in guidelines: four side effects classifications, two performance status scales, 31 PROs, 10 assessment criteria for clinical examinations, seven assessment methods and tools for the evaluation of technical, equipment-based procedures and five technical, equipment-based procedures. It was possible to identify and select sound and <b>standardised</b> assessment <b>methods</b> and tools for almost all functioning areas defined in the ICF-HNC. Since no tool sufficiently covers support provision by immediate family and by health professionals as well as economic self-sufficiency, we recommend a corresponding update of existing tools...|$|R

50|$|The {{earliest}} <b>standardised</b> <b>method</b> of wiring in buildings, {{in common}} use in North America from about 1880 to the 1930s, was knob and tube (K&T) wiring: single conductors were run through cavities between the structural members in walls and ceilings, with ceramic tubes forming protective channels through joists and ceramic knobs {{attached to the}} structural members to provide air between the wire and the lumber and to support the wires. Since air was free to circulate over the wires, smaller conductors could be used than required in cables. By arranging wires {{on opposite sides of}} building structural members, some protection was afforded against short-circuits that can be caused by driving a nail into both conductors simultaneously.|$|E

5000|$|Small-scale {{cupellation}} may {{be considered}} the most important fire assay developed in history, and perhaps the origin of chemical analysis. [...] Most of the written evidence comes from the Renaissance in the 16th century. Georg Agricola and Lazarus Ercker, among others, wrote about the art of mining and testing the ores, as well as detailed descriptions of cupellation. Their descriptions and assumptions have been identified within diverse archaeological findings through Medieval and Renaissance Europe. By these {{times the amount of}} fire assays increased considerably, mainly because of testing the ores in the mines in order to identify the availability of its exploitation. A primary use of cupellation was related to minting activities, and it was also used in testing jewelry. [...] Since the Renaissance, cupellation became a <b>standardised</b> <b>method</b> of analysis that has changed very little, demonstrating its efficiency. Its development certainly touched the spheres of economy, politics, warfare and power in ancient times.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Earl of Clare" [...] was {{probably}} not a medieval title. Some contemporary sources called them [...] "Earls of Clare", but many modern historians treat this {{as if it were}} a [...] "styled" [...] (self-assumed) title. There was no <b>standardised</b> <b>method</b> of reference to earls in the late eleventh and twelfth centuries, and the Clares were one of a handful referred to as earls in this period without a county mentioned. For example, Gerald of Wales recounts an incident relating to the Earl of Clare, possibly referring to William Fitz Robert, 2nd Earl of Gloucester. [...] Such references led some older historians to assume the Earls of Gloucester and Hertford also carried the title Earls of Clare. The title, for instance, is given in the original Dictionary of National Biography. [...] The confusion probably stems from misinterpretation of references, such as that of [...] "Earl Gilbert de Clare", in which Clare was taken as a title rather than a surname. The modern view is there was no such title. [...] Accordingly, the accepted modern view is that the first creation of the title Earl of Clare dates to 1624.|$|E
