5|$|The {{distinction}} between viral {{upper respiratory tract}} infections is loosely based on the location of symptoms with the common cold affecting primarily the nose, pharyngitis the throat, and bronchitis the lungs. However, there can be significant overlap and multiple areas can be affected. The common cold is frequently defined as nasal inflammation with varying amount of throat inflammation. <b>Self-diagnosis</b> is frequent. Isolation of the viral agent involved is rarely performed, and it is generally not possible to identify the virus type through symptoms.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode is}} set on the fiftieth {{birthday}} of Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), {{and much of the}} plot revolves around his concerns with his age and desire to reclaim the happiness of his childhood. At the same time, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) is forced to deal with her ex-boyfriend Dennis Duffy (Winters) and his <b>self-diagnosis</b> as a sex addict as well as the fact that Dennis slept with her close friend Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski). A final plotline in the episode involves the desire of Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) to travel in space, and the efforts by Liz and Jack to deceive him into thinking he has done so.|$|E

500|$|In the 1890s Richard Cabot of Harvard Medical School {{studied the}} healing testimonies {{published}} by the Christian Science Journal, which Eddy founded in 1883, for his senior thesis. He wrote in McClures in 1908 that the claims were based on <b>self-diagnosis</b> or secondhand reports from doctors, and attributed them to the placebo effect.

2500|$|To one twentieth-century critic, Gregory Dart, this <b>self-diagnosis</b> by Hazlitt {{of his own}} misanthropic enmities was {{the sour}} and surreptitiously {{preserved}} offspring of Jacobinism.

He speculates that, after being moved to Roman, Safirin was jealous of Ghenadie Georgescu, the titular bishop of Râmnic. However, Sîrbu also writes that the consistory, as a [...] "double for the Synod", was [...] "anti-canonical".|$|E
5000|$|<b>Self-diagnosis</b> {{is prone}} to error and may be {{potentially}} dangerous if inappropriate decisions are {{made on the basis}} of a misdiagnosis. [...] Because of the risks, <b>self-diagnosis</b> is officially discouraged by governments, physicians, and patient care organizations. Even physicians are discouraged from engaging in <b>self-diagnosis,</b> because doctors also make mistakes in diagnosing themselves. [...] If the <b>self-diagnosis</b> is wrong, then the misdiagnosis can result in improper health care, including wrong treatments and lack of care for serious conditions.|$|E

5000|$|However, <b>self-diagnosis</b> may be {{appropriate}} under certain circumstances.

5000|$|One of the {{greatest}} dangers of self diagnosis in psychological syndromes, is that you may miss a medical disease that masquerades as a psychiatric syndrome. <b>Self-diagnosis</b> also undermines {{the role of the}} doctor-which is not the best way to start the relationship. Then there {{is the fact that we}} can know and see ourselves, but sometimes, we need a mirror to see ourselves more clearly. By self-diagnosing, you may be missing something that you cannot see. Another danger of self diagnosis is that you may think that there is more wrong with you than there actually is. <b>Self-diagnosis</b> is also a problem when you are in a state of denial about your symptoms.|$|E

50|$|Other doctors {{express concern}} about {{patients}} who self-diagnose {{on the basis}} of information obtained from the Internet when the patient demonstrates an incomplete or distorted understanding of other diagnostic possibilities and medical likelihoods.

50|$|Although {{results are}} almost {{certainly}} significantly better when professional guidance is utilized (see especially family therapy), numerous attempts at making the methodologies available generally via self-help books {{and other media}} are available. In {{the last few years}} it has become increasingly popular for these self-help books to become popularized and published as an e-book available on the web, or through content articles on blogs and websites.

50|$|Many {{studies do}} not include a cross-modal {{reference}} and simply categorize individuals {{on the basis of}} the bitterness of a concentrated PROP solution or PROP impregnated paper. It is also possible to make a reasonably accurate <b>self-diagnosis</b> at home by careful examination of the tongue and looking for the number of fungiform papillae. Blue food dye can make this easier. Being a supertaster or nontaster is part of normal variation in the human population, as are eye color and hair color, so no treatment is needed.|$|E
50|$|Several reports {{suggest that}} there may be {{opposition}} to the development of such a device by national medical regulating authorities such as the Food and Drug Administration in the United States, as well as possible opposition by doctors unwilling to permit consumers to do extensive <b>self-diagnosis.</b> There is agreement that such a device could bring huge increases in productivity and cost-savings, and spur a billion dollar market. There are signs that over a hundred venture-capital firms have invested $1.1 billion in digital health technology in 2012.|$|E

These admissions were to have serious consequences for Laing as they formed part of the case against him by the General Medical Council which led to him ceasing to practise medicine.
