Numerical solutions for periodic oblique wave groups with envelopes of permanent shape are calculated from the equations for irrotational three dimensional deep water motion with nonlinear upper free surface conditions. It is shown that some analytical solutions for oblique wave groups calculated from the two (horizontal) dimensional nonlinear Schrodinger equation are in error because they ignore the resonant forcing of certain harmonics in two dimensions. The numerical method casts doubts also on the physical relevance of solutions of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation for which the envelope of the group passes through zero. Particular attention is given to oblique wave groups whose group to wave angle is in the neighbourhood of the critical angle tan⁻¹ (1 /√ 2), corresponding to waves on the boundary wedge of the Kelvin ship-wave pattern...|$|R
5000|$|Space cloth is a {{hypothetical}} infinite plane of conductive material having a resistance of η ohms per square, where η is the Impedance of free space. η ≈ 376.7 ohms. If a transmission line composed of <b>straight</b> <b>parallel</b> perfect conductors in free space is terminated by space cloth that is normal to {{the transmission line}} then that transmission line is terminated by its characteristic impedance. [...] The calculation of the characteristic impedance of a transmission line composed of <b>straight,</b> <b>parallel</b> good conductors may {{be replaced by the}} calculation of the D.C. resistance between electrodes placed on a two-dimensional resistive surface. This equivalence can be used in reverse to calculate the resistance between two conductors on a resistive sheet if the arrangement of the conductors {{is the same as the}} cross section of a transmission line of known impedance.
