50|$|The starter bar, {{also called}} a dummy bar, has a free end portion which is {{flexible}} for storage and a substantially rigid portion {{at the end}} which plugs the mold. The starter bar is constructed in discrete blocks secured {{to one side of}} a planar spine provided in segments and arranged end to end. Adjustable spacers in the form of tapered blocks are disposed between the blocks of the bar to allow the starter bar to be self-supporting in a curved configuration corresponding to the casting path. A more flexible spine in the end portion of the starter bar allows the starter bar to be curved to a tighter radius than that of the casting path while the blocks fan out in an unsupported configuration. A storage ramp is provided to support the flexible end in the stored position. Before a cast is started, the <b>starter</b> <b>bars</b> are fed through the caster (in reverse direction of casting) using hydraulic actuators. Once fed {{all the way to the}} bottom of the mold, the process of packing the mold can continue to ensure a smooth start up.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{investigation}} into the cause and consequences of an observed brittle behaviour of some <b>starter</b> <b>bars</b> on a construction site in the Netherlands. A few bars suddenly failed when they were bent in order to align them. For the investigation firstly a batch of <b>starter</b> <b>bars</b> that possibly exhibited the same brittle behaviour was traced using a bending test. Both a parameter related to the applied manufacturing process and the nitrogen content of the <b>starter</b> <b>bars,</b> were used to distinguish between probable brittle and ductile <b>starter</b> <b>bars.</b> The fatigue behaviour of the brittle <b>starter</b> <b>bars</b> as well as the ductility of the connection in which these <b>starter</b> <b>bars</b> were used, were investigated experimentally. The fatigue life appeared to be reduced and brittle failures were also observed in the connection where the <b>starter</b> <b>bars</b> are loaded in tension. It could be demonstrated that the structure in which these <b>starter</b> <b>bars</b> were used, still satisfies the requirements. Since the observed brittle behaviour can not be detected by the tests according to the current Dutch Approval Guideline, it is recommended to add an additional bending test, which might be defined using the results of this investigation...|$|E

40|$|Bibliography: pages 51 - 52. Five {{series of}} tests were {{performed}} to investigate the anchorage bond stresses in concrete bases. In Series I to IV concrete base specimens were loaded and column <b>starter</b> <b>bar</b> strains measured for different supporting conditions of the base. Curves indicating the distribution of steel compressive stresses and bond stresses in the columns and base slabs are given. Results from these tests indicate that the conventional design approach towards bond stresses in concrete bases is conservative and that the allowable bond stresses in BS CP 110 seem to be too low while the maximum stresses specified in ACI 318 - 71 and the CEB-FIP Recommendations {{seem to be more}} acceptable. In Series V pull-out tests were made on 60 concrete cube specimens subjected to biaxial normal pressure. The ultimate bond strength was found to increase with applied normal pressure in proportion to the square root of the normal pressure and square root of the concrete strength. A comparative finite element stress analysis was done on a typical concrete base specimen and the results were found to be in accordance with the results of the tests in Series I to IV...|$|R
40|$|The {{stability}} of thin reinforced concrete cantilever walls with lateral displacement restraint at roof level designed for limited ductility under gravity and in-plane seismic loading is investigated in this project. A {{large number of}} innovative designs of very tall and slender reinforced concrete walls have been developed in New Zealand ahead of the design standard {{in the past five}} years. In order to understand the actual wall behaviour and obtain the quantitative design verifications, limited experimental work has been performed {{for the past few years}} at the University of Canterbury. The test results of the previous experimental work are reviewed. Four slender precast concrete 1 : 2. 5 scale walls were tested up to failure under reversed cyclic loading regime with increased displacement level. The walls were 3. 75 m high, 1 m long and 50 mm thick. The aspect and slenderness ratios were 3. 75 and 75, respectively. The two main variables investigated were in effect the eccentric axial load ratios and the ratio between the lap splice length of the <b>starter</b> <b>bars</b> and the height to the point of inflection. Only one of the test units, which had longer lap-splice and imposed eccentric vertical load, was susceptible to lateral buckling failure due to a significant cracking in the lower half of the wall and the excessive out-of-plane displacement. The units with an artificial lap-splice (welded connection) performed well and failed due to loss of strength caused by fracturing of <b>starter</b> <b>bars</b> after being buckled under the effects of reversed cyclic loading. Failure was observed near the welds along an artificial lap splice. Twisting of the walls at the base of the walls was observed in the tests. A continuum method for the seismic design and assessment of thin precast concrete walls is proposed. The method can be applied to walls of structures designed for the range of elastic to limited ductility response...|$|E
40|$|Earlier {{studies have}} shown that post-installed {{reinforcing}} bars are capable of developing bond behavior equivalent to cast-inplace reinforcing bars. Therefore, connections with post-installed <b>starter</b> <b>bars</b> using qualified adhesives can be designed according to conventional anchorage design provisions. However, this approach often results in development lengths which cannot be accommodated in structural joints without hooks due to the limited thickness of members. The results of 16 full-scale tests presented in this paper show the beneficial effect of increased bond strengths due to column moment loading and the adverse effect of reduced bond strengths due to cyclic loading on the seismic performance of column-to-foundation connections. The quantification of both effects is a prerequisite {{for the development of a}} new design methodology for these joints, which are based on current bonded anchor design provisions. The proposed design approach potentially allows a reduction of the development length to the extent that hooks may not be required...|$|E
40|$|Superelastic Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs) {{are being}} {{explored}} as alternative reinforcing materials to traditional deformed steel reinforcement for seismic applications. The main advantage {{is the ability}} of the SMA to recover large nonlinear strains, which promotes the self-centering phenomenon. The primary objective of this research is to present the performance, before and after repair, of slender reinforced concrete shear walls, one reinforced internally with SMAs in the boundary zones within the plastic hinge region and other control wall reinforced with conventional steel only. The repair procedure included removal of damaged concrete within the plastic hinge region, replacing fractured and buckled reinforcement, followed by shortening of the SMA reinforcement in the boundary zones of SMA wall. The removed concrete was replaced with self-consolidating concrete, while the concrete above the plastic hinge region remained intact. The SMA reinforced concrete shear wall (before and after repair) exhibited stable hysteretic response with significant strength, and displacement and energy dissipation capacities. In addition, the walls exhibited pinching in the hysteretic response as a result of minimizing the residual displacements due to the restoring capacity of the SMA reinforcement. The results demonstrate that SMA reinforced components are self-centering, permitting repairing of damaged areas. Furthermore, the SMA reinforcement is re-usable given its capacity to reset to its original state. The length of the SMA bars in the original and repaired wall, in addition to the presence of <b>starter</b> <b>bars</b> in the original wall, were significant factors in the location of failure of the walls. The conventional steel wall prior to repair was unstable due to large residual displacements experienced during the original test. After repair the wall exhibited ratcheting in hysteretic response but with significant strength. The conventional wall, before and after repair, dissipated more energy than the SMA wall. This {{was the result of the}} wider hysteretic loops with reduced punching, but at the cost of large residual displacements. The <b>starter</b> <b>bars</b> in the conventional wall before repair controlled the location of failure, while the presence of couplers in the plastic hinge region was the main factor in determining the failure location in the repaired conventional wall...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Electrical and Computer EngineeringAnil PahwaWarren N. WhiteThis thesis {{focuses on}} {{estimating}} the power loss from power panelboards {{by means of}} power loss models. The model {{is intended to be}} used by HVAC engineers to help estimate building heat loss. While McDonald & Hickok (1985) did not report power losses for power panelboards, Rubin (1979) did. These publications present the power losses of electrical devices at rated loads in tables. In this thesis, the models for electrical devices are created and used, instead of tables, to estimate power losses. The use of curve fit models presents a convenience in calculation of power losses. Breaker, fusible switch, and motor starter power losses presented by McDonald & Hickok (1985) and Rubin (1979) were updated using manufacturer published data, technical papers, industrial standards, and test samples. Test, manufacturer, and analytical model data are collected and power loss curve fit models are created for breakers, fusible switches, motor <b>starters,</b> and bus <b>bars</b> with enclosures. The panelboard power loss is calculated as the sum of partial power losses of the component electrical equipment, i. e. breakers, fusible switches, motor <b>starters,</b> and bus <b>bars</b> with enclosures used in power panelboards. A power loss model for main breaker and fusible switch power panelboards are created based on the sum of breaker, fusible switch, motor <b>starter,</b> and bus <b>bars</b> with enclosure power loss models. The main breaker and fusible switch power panelboard power loss models are used in a heat loss example. It is shown that power panelboard power losses can be significantly overestimated when calculated with one of the methods currently used (Rubin, 1979). This can result in erroneous sizing of HVAC equipment...|$|R
40|$|Paper 18 In current practice, {{floor slab}} and beams in the {{perimeter}} seismic frames are monolithically constructed and rigidly connected {{to each other}} through <b>starter</b> <b>bars.</b> This rigid connection ensures that the shear friction between {{the floor and the}} seismic beam transfers the inertial force resulting from the response acceleration of the floor mass and any superimposed dead loads to the moment resisting seismic frame. But, this rigid connection between the floor and perimeter seismic beams leads to several complications such as: (i) possibility of stronger beam (than columns) because of the slab contribution on the negative moment capacity of seismic beams; (ii) possibility of (unidirectional) plastic hinge forming away from column face; and (iii) the floor-beam compatibility requirement leading to severe damage in the slab as the seismic beams deflect in double curvature and grow in length due to elongation of the plastic hinges at the same time. In a quest to avoid these complications, this paper investigates the feasibility of a floor slab that is detached completely from the perimeter seismic beams. In this system, the slab is rigidly connected to the intermediate beams, which are designed to transfer the inertial force to the columns through shear friction and/or torsional resistance. This idea is conceptually discussed and its validity is scrutinized in the pape...|$|E
40|$|Hollow-core {{flooring}} {{units are}} designed as simply supported members. However, frequently in construction, continuity is established between the units and supporting structure {{by the addition}} of insitu topping concrete and steel reinforcement. This change in structural form can result in negative bending moments and axial forces being induced in the floor by seismic and other structural actions. Significant negative moments are induced by load combinations that include the effects of seismic forces due to vertical ground motion. The focus of this research was two failure mechanisms possible under these loading conditions, a flexural failure and a shear failure. Both failure mechanisms were investigated analytically and experimentally. A brittle flexural failure was observed experimentally in a sub assembly test that contained <b>starter</b> <b>bars</b> and mesh reinforcement in the insitu topping concrete. The failure occurred at loads lower than those predicted using standard flexural theory. It appears that, due to the prestressing and low reinforcement ratio of the topping concrete, the assumption that plane sections remain plane is not appropriate for this situation. It is proposed that a strain concentration factor be introduced to account for the effects of tension stiffening. This factor improves the correlation between observed and predicted flexural strength. The second failure mode investigated was a flexure shear failure in a negative moment zone. Flexural cracks reduce the shear strength of a reinforced concrete member. Analytical predictions suggest that some hollow-core floor details could be prone to this type of brittle failure. A flexure shear failure was not observed experimentally; however, this does not eliminate the possibility of this failure mode. A summary of other failure mechanisms possible in hollow-core flooring is also presented. All failure modes should to be considered as part of establishing a hierarchy of failure in the design or retrofit of hollow-core floors...|$|E
40|$|Precast {{concrete}} {{panels are}} a popular construction technique {{due to their}} increased construction speed, low cost {{and the ability to}} use the precast concrete elements for structural walls to provide high strength and stiffness when used for structural purposes. Slender precast concrete wall panels are a common construction method for single storey warehouse type buildings. Following the Canterbury earthquake sequence Christchurch from 2010 – 2014, damage was observed in precast concrete wall buildings that resulted in out-of-plane collapse of wall panels.. This project seeks to investigate the behaviour of precast reinforced concrete walls designed for limited ductility under gravity and quasi-static in-plane loading. The main point of interest in this thesis research is to understand the seismic behaviour of the connection as well as the out-of-plane stability of slender panels. To investigate the behaviour of this panel and connection type, three slender precast concrete walls, representing full scale panel geometry were subjected to quasi-static cyclic loading. Two common panel to foundation connection types were studied: 1) threaded inserts and 2) traditional <b>starter</b> <b>bars</b> as well as one alternative connection which was developed as a means to improve the out-of-plane response and understand the impact of this design choice on the in-plane behavior of the wall. For all the three units, the dowel connection performed well and the thin wall failed under flexural failure due to loss of strength cause by fracturing of longitudinal rebars after being buckled under the effects of lateral cyclic loading. Significant horizontal cracking occurred on each of the tests at dowel level except unit threaded insert with 50 mm cover behind the head of the insert (TI 12 -C 50 -IP) which suffered a secondary horizontal crack at 500 mm above the main crack and a diagonal crack {{at the center of the}} wall. Moreover, this unit was able to undergo more deformation due to a secondary crack...|$|E
40|$|Structural {{walls are}} {{frequently}} used in buildings to resist earthquake lateral loads {{because of their}} effectiveness in limiting the building drifts and minimizing damage to both structural and non-structural elements. In a collaborative effort, {{as part of a}} PreNEESR project, three y -scale reinforced concrete rectangular shear walls were subjected to cyclic loading at the Multi-Axial Subassemblage Testing facility (MAST) at University of Minnesota. Also, a y-scale precast wall system was tested at National Center for Research on Earthquake Engineering (NCREE), Taiwan to validate PreWEC system concept. Overall dimensions of all four rectangular walls were identical, except that four different approaches were used to anchor the wall into the foundation. In the first wall, RWN, the longitudinal reinforcement was anchored into the foundation with adequate anchorage length without using any splices, while the second and third walls used couplers and code-based conventional lap splices to connect the wall reinforcement with the <b>starter</b> <b>bars</b> placed in the foundation. The precast wall, referred as PreWEC- 1, used unbonded post-tensioning to anchor the wall to the foundation. All three reinforced concrete walls had two different stiffness and strength in the two in-plane loading directions as they were modeled to represent the response of a T-shaped concrete wall tested as part of the same project. PreWEC- 1 was designed to replicate the response of RWN in in-plane weaker direction. The fiber-based nonlinear beam-column element available in OpenSees software was used to model all three reinforced concrete walls with adequate attention to capture the influence of different anchorage details. In addition to capturing the total global response, the accuracy of the analysis was also examined in terms of simulating the local response as well as various displacement components due to flexure, bond slip at the critical section resulting from strain penetration, and shear. A zero-length bond slip element was used to account for the strain penetration effects while a nonlinear spring element was used to account for the shear deformation. By comparing with the experimental results, {{it was found that the}} analytical models well simulated the force-displacement responses including the unloading and reloading stiffness. However, it was found that the pinching model available in OpenSEES, which has been used in the past to represent the shear deformation hysteresis, was not capable of capturing all the critical points in the shear deformation response recorded during testing. Hence, a monotonic and hysteretic cyclic shear model was proposed using the strut-and-tie modeling technique. The proposed cyclic shear model captured the observed experimental shear response adequately. As part of PreWEC- 1, testing an innovative, economical mild steel connector was developed and its behavior under cyclic shear loading was characterized using experimental and analytical means. The PreWEC system performed exceptionally well with good energy dissipation, self-centering ability and had 15 % higher capacity compared to the traditional reinforced concrete wall. Simplified analytical and design methods were proposed to characterize the behavior and designing of PreWEC systems. The simplified analysis captured overall force-displacement response, connector displacements and wall contact length accurately...|$|E
40|$|Major {{advances}} {{have been observed}} {{during the last two}} decades in the field of seismic engineering with further refinements of performance-based seismic design philosophies and the subsequent definition of corresponding compliance criteria. Following the globally recognized expectation and ideal aim to provide a modern society with high (seismic) performance structures able to sustain a design level earthquake with limited or negligible damage, alternative solutions have been developed for high-performance, seismic resisting systems. In the last two decades, an alternative approach in seismic design has been introduced for precast concrete buildings in seismic regions with the introduction of “dry” jointed ductile systems also called “hybrid” systems based on unbonded post-tensioned rocking connections. As a result structural systems with high seismic performance capabilities can be implemented, with the unique capability to undergo inelastic displacement similar to their traditional monolithic counterparts, while limiting the damage to the structural system and assuring full re-centring capabilities (negligible residual or permanent deformations). The continuous and rapid development of jointed ductile connections for seismic resisting systems has resulted in the validation {{of a wide range of}} alternative arrangements, encompassed under the general umbrella of “hybrid” systems. This research provides a comprehensive experimental and analytical investigations of 2 - and 3 -Dimensional, 2 / 3 scaled, exterior beam-column joints subjected both uni and bi-directional (four clove) quasic-static loading protocols into the behaviour, modelling, design and feasibility of new arrangements for “dry” jointed ductile systems for use in regions of high seismicity. In order to further emphasize the enhanced performance of these systems, a comparison with the experimental response and observed damage of 2 -D and 3 -D monolithic beam-column benchmark specimens is presented. However, after a lot of attention given to the behaviour of the skeleton structure, more recently the focus of research in Earthquake Engineering has concentrated on the behaviour of the floor system within the overall 3 D behaviour of the building and the effects of beam elongation. The effects of beam elongation in precast frame systems have been demonstrated to be a potential source of un-expected damage, unless adequate detailing is provided in order to account for displacement incompatibilities between the lateral resisting systems and the floor. Two contributions to beam elongation are typically recognized: a) the material contribution due to the cumulative residual strain within the steel, and b) the geometrical contribution due to the presence of a neutral axis and actual depth of the beam. Regarding jointed ductile connections with re-centering characteristics, the extent of beam elongation is significantly reduced, being limited to solely the geometrical contribution. Furthermore, such effects could be minimized when a reduced depth of the beam is adopted due to the use of internal prestressing or external post-tensioning. However, damage to precast floor systems, resulting from a geometric elongation of the beam, has yet to be addressed in detail. In order to emphasize the enhanced performance in controlling and minimizing the damage of the structural elements via the use of the proposed advanced hybrid solutions, this research presents via experimental and analytical validation of two alternative and innovative solutions to reduce the damage to the floor using 2 and 3 -Dimensional, 2 / 3 scaled, exterior beam-column joints. The first approach consists of using standard precast rocking/dissipative frame connections (herein referred to as “gapping”) in combination with an articulated or “jointed” floor. This system uses mechanical devices to connect the floor and the lateral beams which can accommodate the displacement incompatibilities in the connection. The second approach to reduce the floor damage investigates the implementation of a “non-gapping” connection, also called non-tearing-floor connection, using a top hinge at the beam-column interface, while still relying on more traditional floor-to-frame connections (i. e. topping and continuous <b>starter</b> <b>bars).</b> Additionally, further refinements and constructability issues for the non gapping connection are investigated under the experimental and analytical validation of a major 2 -Dimensional, 2 / 3 scaled, two-story one-bay frame using non-tearing floor connections. Based on the non-tearing floor connections, a series of parametric analysis for beam-column joints and frames are carried out. Furthermore, the analysis and design of two prototype frames using different solutions is presented. The frames are subjected to cyclic adaptive pushover and inelastic time history analysis in order to investigate analytically the response characteristics of hybrid frames using non-tearing connections, as well as how the beam growth affects the frame response under earthquake loading. Computational models for hybrid PRESSS frames and a conventional reinforced concrete frames are developed and compared with the ones using non-tearing connections...|$|E
