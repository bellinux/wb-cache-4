40|$|Aquaculture is {{the fastest}} growing sector of food {{production}} in the world. However, rapid expansion of <b>shrimp</b> <b>aquaculture</b> ponds may induce potentially detrimental changes in extent and health of coastal habitats utilized by migratory shorebirds. The aim of this work is to describe the landscape changes that occurred between 1990 and 2006 in coastal Northeast Brazil {{as a result of}} increased shrimp pond development. A suite of remote sensing techniques was employed to process Landsat and ASTER imagery at three separate time periods (1990, 2000 & 2006) and generate land cover maps for each time period. Post-classification change detection analysis revealed critical conversions between identified coastal habitat types in Northeast Brazil. The results of this study revealed a substantial growth of <b>shrimp</b> <b>aquaculture</b> facilities on the northern coast of Northeast Brazil between 1990 and 2006. Contrary to the literature, the expansive tidal salt flats in the study area, not mangrove forests, are experiencing the greatest destruction as a result of <b>shrimp</b> <b>aquaculture.</b> Research and <b>management</b> efforts should be directed at determining the extent of utilization of these salt flat areas by migratory shorebirds...|$|R

40|$|In Southeast Asia, <b>shrimp</b> <b>aquaculture</b> {{has been}} practiced {{for many years}} and is a {{traditional}} coastal farming activity in several countries. The recent trend has been towards more intensive forms of culture resulting in a number of problems. However, experiences in the region suggest that shrimp farming can be socially, environmentally and economically sustainable and contribute to the production of food and alleviation of poverty in coastal areas, provided that appropriate management practices are adopted. Technical, economic, social and environmental issues have to be considered in {{the development and implementation of}} such management practices. In the light of serious shrimp disease problems which have affected shrimp farming worldwide, and various environmental and social interactions, some have concluded that shrimp farming development in the region has not been completely sustainable. This paper provides background on the major sustainability issues and management strategies which need to be considered in the development of sustainable <b>shrimp</b> <b>aquaculture.</b> Good farm <b>management</b> practices such as farm siting, construction and design, seed quality, feed and fertilizer, water management, sediment management, shrimp health management practices, and efficient use of inputs and resources should be voluntarily followed and monitored. In order to maintain social harmony and minimize environmental impacts, integration of aquaculture into coastal area management as well as appropriate zoning, policies, regulations and legislation should be allowed for a balanced coastal development. Furthermore, active cooperation among farmers and their involvement in policy setting and planning for coastal development can contribute to better understanding of key issues and promotion of better management practices. Fortunately, awareness and experience in sustainable <b>management</b> of coastal <b>shrimp</b> <b>aquaculture</b> in Southeast Asia is growing, and a number of local, national and regional initiatives are being taken to develop and implement improved management practices. At international levels, the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries Responsible Fisheries (CCRF), adopted in 1995 as a global inter-governmental consensus on the promotion of sustainable fisheries and aquaculture developments, provides a framework of basic principles and norms which all stakeholders concerned with shrimp culture can use as a common platform for better understanding, consultation and collaboration. Examples of recent efforts by NACA, in cooperation with FAO and other interested partners, in the implementation of the CCRF are given, and suggestions are provided to further promote the sustainable development of shrimp culture.

The present study aims to show key performance characteristics of organic shrimp farmers and farming in a prototypical shrimp farming area in Bangladesh. Data was collected in 2009 from organic shrimp farmers in the Kaligonj and Shyamnagar sub-districts through questionnaire interviews, transect walks and focus group discussions. The mean productivity of organic shrimp farming in the area is 320 kg ha− 1 yr− 1 (ranging from 120 to 711 kg ha− 1 year− 1 ). Organic farmers are more likely to have a higher monthly income and less aquaculture experience.

Khulna division is the largest farmed shrimp producer (accounting for 86 % of national <b>shrimp</b> <b>aquaculture</b> production) and Satkhira district (Southwestern parts of Bangladesh) accounted for 31 % of Khulna shrimp farm production and 26 % of national shrimp farm production in 2014 (BBS 2017).

40|$|Ecological <b>shrimp</b> <b>aquaculture</b> derives its feed {{input from}} the {{naturally}} occurring food sources. This practice has an environmental advantage of reducing the use of fish meal as the main food input. Use of fish meal in aquaculture has {{a negative effect on}} the coastal fisheries in the sense of depleting fish stocks. It also has a tendency to discharge wastes that pollutes the receiving coastal ecosystems. Ecological <b>shrimp</b> <b>aquaculture</b> therefore impacts low burden to the coastal ecosystems since it is integrated into the estuarine food chain. The potential of <b>shrimp</b> <b>aquaculture</b> in Kenya is high. However the initial development attempts heavily relied on the mangrove ecosystem and expensive technology. The environmental efforts to conserve the mangrove forest and the inability of the poor community to adopt the expensive technology led to the collapse of the <b>shrimp</b> <b>aquaculture</b> in Kenya. The potential approach to revive this practice therefore depends on defining ways which are not destructive to the mangrove ecosystem and which falls within the economic capability of the local community. Ecological <b>shrimp</b> <b>aquaculture</b> uses naturally generated and locally available inputs making it less costly to develop and manage. For instance, the food inputs can be derived from the estuarine ecosystem or enhanced by promoting microbial proteins. A microbial intercept would also prevent discharge of nitrogenous pollutants. However this would depend on the general setting of the shrimp ponds so that most appropriate inputs to enhance the supply of the natural food is optimised. The following study therefore attempt to explore to what extent the penaeid shrimp post larvae would rely on the natural food derived from the decomposing leaf litter of the mangrove, Rhizophora mucronata. It is hoped that the observations of this interaction can be employed in the design and management of an ecological shrimp culture practice in the Kenyan mangroves. The role of micro-biota such as the microbial community, micro-algae and meiofauna in supporting a potential food chain with the penaeid shrimp post larvae as an apex consumer is hereby explored. Specific attention is focused on the nutritional requirement of Penaeus monodon and Penaeus indicus. These penaeid shrimp species are of commercial food importance both globally and along the Kenyan coast. The study derives insight from recent studies on bacteria and micro-algae in the processing of nutrients resulting in the production of a potential diet for small invertebrates and penaeid shrimp. Moreover, an ecological approach to <b>shrimp</b> <b>aquaculture</b> cannot be accomplished without considering the policy issues governing the utilization of the coastal resources in Kenya. The motivation for this study is to recommend an ecological approach to <b>shrimp</b> <b>aquaculture</b> as a fishing activity in Kenya. It is visualised that this approach has a potential to increase income and food security to the local communities deriving livelihood from the Kenyan mangrove ecosystems. The overall aim of this PhD study was to understand the feeding ecology of penaeid shrimp in a mangrove system and to apply this knowledge to design an ecological <b>shrimp</b> <b>aquaculture</b> system which can derive biological food resources from the mangrove ecosystem. Five specific research themes were assessed: 1) the extent to which shrimp post larvae can ingest and assimilate organic matter from decomposing mangrove leaf litter given the option of a bacterial biofilm as a food source; 2) the microbial contribution to the nutritive value of the decomposing mangrove leaf litter and the associated biofilm to shrimp post larvae in comparison to an estuarine food source; 3) the temporal variation in the biota associated with the biofilm developing on the decomposing mangrove litter and their food-value-potential to support the growth of shrimp post larvae; 4) the effect of exposure to the different environmental conditions of sunlight and sediment to the temporal variation in the diversity and abundance of biota associated with the biofilm developing on the decomposing leaf litter; 5) the nutritive effect of the biofilm associated with the decomposing mangrove leaf litter on the physiological performance of shrimp post larvae...|$|R
