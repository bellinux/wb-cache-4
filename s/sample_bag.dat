40|$|As soil–atmosphere fluxes of {{greenhouse}} gases are characterized by high temporal fluctuations, frequent measurements {{in the range of}} hours to days need to be deployed, resulting in high analytical costs. We have therefore developed a new low-cost system that combines high-frequency automated sampling with low-frequency chemical analysis. The System for Inert Gas Monitoring by Accumulation (SIGMA) is suited particularly for stand-alone observations in remote locations. The SIGMA is connected to an automated chamber with headspace sampling several times per day. Air samples are aggregated in <b>sampling</b> <b>bags,</b> which reduces the number of subsequent laboratory analyses and allows calculation of average flux rates over extended sampling periods. The SIGMA was tested under field conditions and compared with a conventional autochamber system, where flux rates were measured several times per day.

40|$|Data on {{the acute}} and/or {{long-term}} toxicity of colored smokes {{appear to be}} scarce and inconsistent. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study is to obtain more insight on this matter. For this purpose, existing platforms for in vitro toxicity screening are evaluated with respect to their applicability to determining the toxicity of colored smokes. The platforms chosen are CULTEX® using human lung cells (A 549) or human keratinocytes (HaCat) in culture to study acute toxicity, and CULTEX® with an Ames module, using bacteria (Salmonella typhimurium), to study long-term adverse effects. The tested colored smokes are green, yellow and red. Acute toxicity was determined as follows: the colored smoke grenade was ignited inside a ventilated bunker. Wells containing the lung cells and keratinocytes were placed in the vicinity of the grenade and were thus exposed to the colored smoke. Meanwhile the smoke was sampled in a gas <b>sampling</b> <b>bag,</b> the number of particles in the smoke was counted and the particle sizes were determined with an aerosol particle sizer. Next, the exposed cells were cultured and various parameters that are indicative of cell toxicity were measured. Also, other wells with lung cells and keratinocytes were exposed to the contents of the gas <b>sampling</b> <b>bag</b> using the CULTEX® system. The composition of the smoke collected in the gas <b>sampling</b> <b>bag</b> was determined using continuous two-dimensional gas chromatography combined with time-of-flight mass-spectrometry (GC*GC-Tof-MS). Long-term toxicity was studied by exposing the bacteria in the CULTEX® Ames module to the contents of the gas <b>sampling</b> <b>bag.</b> Next, the bacteria were cultured on a medium which lacks an essential nutrient for these bacteria. Consequently, the bacteria cannot grow on this medium. However, mutagenic compounds will enable the bacteria to produce the essential nutrient, and therefore they will grow on this medium. The results obtained so far will be presented. This study is supported by The Netherlands’ Defence Materiel Organizatio...|$|R

An in-vehicle direct exhaust dual bag sampling technique was used to simultaneously collect exhaust samples upstream and downstream of the three-way catalyst (TWC). The cold start tests were conducted over a year, with ambient temperatures ranging from – 2 °C to 32 °C. The exhaust system was instrumented with thermocouples so that the catalyst light off temperature could be determined. The results showed that CO emissions for the cold start were reduced by a factor of 8 downstream of catalyst when ambient temperature rose from - 2 °C to 32 °C, the corresponding hydrocarbon emissions were reduced by a factor of 4. There was no clear relationship between NOx emissions and ambient temperature.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Carbon {{monoxide}} {{transfer factor}} (TLCO) varies inversely with the partial pressure of alveolar oxygen (PAO 2). During exercise the PAO 2 in the alveolar gas <b>sample</b> <b>bag</b> decreases so the TLCO increases more {{than would be}} expected {{from the effects of}} exercise alone. The effects of PAO 2 on the estimation of TLCO during exercise have been investigated and studies have been performed to determine whether it is appropriate to standardise to a PAO 2 of 16 kPa. METHODS [...] TLCO was estimated at rest and at a single level of exercise in six normal subjects using test gas mixtures of 0. 3 % carbon monoxide, 14 % helium, and oxygen in three different percentages (17 %, 21 %, and 27 %), remainder nitrogen. In three of the subjects an incremental exercise test with estimates of oxygen consumption (VO 2) and cardiac frequency (fC) was also performed using a mixture containing 18 % oxygen. RESULTS [...] TLCO decreased as levels of inspired oxygen increased. When standardised to a PAO 2 of 16 kPa TLCO became independent of the inspired oxygen concentration. The significance of the curvilinear relations of TLCO and transfer coefficient to VO 2 and fC improved. CONCLUSION [...] The single breath breath holding TLCO should be standardised to a PAO 2 of 16 kPa when estimated during exercise...|$|E

The samples were sealed in airtight bags (plastic), immediately after collection to avoid moisture loss and oxidation. The airtight bag is produced using aluminium-coated polyester which allows maximum reduction of vapour and oxygen permeability. Each ply <b>sample</b> <b>bag</b> was clearly labelled with a chosen number. Samples of bituminous coal and coal-shales were collected from a selected band of the coal seams (Witbank coalfields) and highwalls as shown in Figs.  1 and 2.

40|$|Proper {{temperature}} control {{is essential in}} preventing Clostridium perfringens food poisoning. The U. S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service cooling guidelines offer two options for the cooling of meat products: follow a standard time-temperature schedule or validate that alternative cooling regimens result in {{no more than a}} 1 -log CFU/g increase of C. perfringens and no growth of Clostridium botulinum. The latter option requires laboratory challenge studies to validate the efficacy of a given cooling process. Accordingly, the objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the role of several methodological variables that might be encountered during typical C. perfringens challenge studies. Variables studied included plastic bag type (Whirlpak or Spiral Biotech), sealing method (Multivac or FoodSaver), initial spore inoculum size (1 to approximately 3 log CFU/g), and growth environment (ground beef or Trypticase–peptone–glucose–yeast extract [TPGY] broth). The major factors that affected growth were <b>sample</b> <b>bag</b> type and growth environment. Samples incubated in Whirlpak bags showed significantly less growth than those incubated in Spiral Biotech bags, which was likely due to the former bag’s greater oxygen permeability. C. perfringens spores showed shorter germination, outgrowth, and lag times and C. perfringens cells showed faster growth rates in ground beef compared with TPGY broth. No significant difference was observed between two different sealing methods.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present in the headspace of feces could be used to diagnose or distinguish between chronic diseases of the gastrointestinal tract and apparently healthy volunteers. Methods: A total of 87 people were recruited, divided between 4 categories: healthy volunteers (n = 19), Crohn's disease (n = 22), ulcerative colitis (n = 20), and irritable bowel syndrome (n = 26). They each supplied fecal samples before, and except for the healthy volunteers, after treatment. Fecal samples were incubated in a <b>sample</b> <b>bag</b> with added purified air at 40 [degrees]C and headspace samples were taken and concentrated on thermal sorption tubes. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry then desorbed and analyzed these. The concentrations of a selection of high-abundance compounds were determined and assessed for differences in concentration between the groups. Results: Crohn's disease samples showed significant elevations in the concentrations of ester and alcohol derivates of short-chain fatty acids and indole compared with the other groups; indole and phenol were elevated in ulcerative colitis and irritable bowel syndrome but not at a statistically significant level. After treatment, the levels of many of the VOCs were significantly reduced and were more similar to those concentrations in healthy controls. Conclusions: The abundance of a number of VOCs in feces differs markedly between Crohn's disease and other gastrointestinal conditions. Following treatment, the VOC profile is altered to more closely resemble that of healthy volunteers. ...|$|E
