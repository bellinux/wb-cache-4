5|$|In 2012, however, it was {{reported}} that the series' ratings were declining. The average number of viewers aged 2 to 11 watching SpongeBob at any given time dropped 29% in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to Nielsen. Wall Street Journal business writer John Jannarone suggested that the age of the series and oversaturation of the series might be contributing to the decline of the series' ratings, and might also be directly responsible for the decline in Nickelodeon's overall ratings. Media analyst Todd Juenger directly attributes the decline in Nickelodeon's ratings to the availability of streaming video content on services like Netflix, a provider of on-demand Internet <b>streaming</b> <b>media.</b>|$|E

It was released on 2-disc region 2 DVD on 25 September 2000. A re-release, with new packaging and menus, came on 26 March 2006. The DVD was released in Australia on 4 February 2002 and in the United States on 25 January 2005.

While {{previous}} versions <b>streamed</b> <b>media</b> to UPnP compliant devices (Digital Media Server role) and could play media by fetching {{it from a}} network share (Digital Media Player role), Windows Media Player 12 can access media from the shared media libraries on the network or HomeGroup, <b>stream</b> <b>media</b> to DLNA 1.5 compliant devices and allows itself (once the remote control option is turned on) to be remotely controlled by Digital Media Controller devices which <b>stream</b> <b>media</b> (Digital Media Renderer role). Similarly, the Play To feature once enabled for remote PCs, by turning on remote control of the player, allows compliant devices and computers to be discovered and controlled remotely from a computer running Windows Media Player 12 (Digital Media Controller role). If the devices {{do not support the}} <b>streamed</b> format, Windows <b>Media</b> Player 12 transcodes the format on-the-fly.

40|$|In {{the near}} future, {{wide variety of}} {{wireless}} networks will be merged into the Internet and allow users to continue their application with higher degree of mobility. In such environment, multimedia applications, which require smooth rate transmission, will become more popular. There are two main reasons that cause difficulties in the smooth transmission of <b>stream</b> <b>media</b> application when a user roams around the wireless mobile networks: 1) packets may get lost due to the re-routing caused by handoffs; 2) due to the disparity {{in the amount of}} available bandwidth among wireless cells, handoffs may cause congestion. We propose an end-to-end multi-path transmission scheme that provides a comprehensive solution for the smooth handoffs of <b>stream</b> <b>media.</b> In the proposed scheme, multiple paths are acquired during the handoff period to reach a single mobile node. Multi-layer encoding technique is applied to make the <b>stream</b> <b>media</b> more adaptive to the heterogeneous network environment with different bandwidths. Protection of more important video layer through duplicated transmission is carefully designed for smooth handoff using multiple paths. The performance of the proposed multi-path handoff scheme is evaluated and compared with existing schemes through extensive simulations. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme improves the throughput and quality for <b>stream</b> <b>media</b> application during the handoff. Cost of the proposed scheme is also carefully evaluated in terms of transmission efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) <b>media</b> <b>streaming</b> networks, {{motivated}} by the huge success of P 2 P file downloading networks, have recently attracted {{a lot of research}} interest.

In this paper, we focus on live P 2 P <b>media</b> <b>streaming</b> networks, a promising application flourishing in the Internet and which requires the distribution of live (not stored) multimedia content to subscribers. We review the architectures for live P 2 P <b>media</b> <b>streaming</b> networks, and consider both overlay topologies and their construction. ...|$|R
