5|$|This {{position}} was contested by Andrés Nin {{and some other}} members of the League who did not support the call for a new International. This group prioritised regroupment with other communist oppositions, principally the International Communist Opposition (ICO), linked to the Right Opposition in the Soviet Party, a regroupment which eventually {{led to the formation of}} the International Bureau for Revolutionary Socialist Unity. Trotsky considered those organisations to be centrist. Despite Trotsky, the <b>Spanish</b> <b>section</b> merged with the <b>Spanish</b> <b>section</b> of ICO, forming the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM). Trotsky claimed the merger was to be a capitulation to centrism. The Socialist Workers' Party of Germany, a left split from the Social Democratic Party of Germany founded in 1931, co-operated with the International Left Opposition briefly in 1933 but soon abandoned the call for a new International.|$|E

25|$|Canals’ {{full-time}} {{employment in the}} Barcelona University commenced in controversial circumstances. In 1965 Manuel Sacristán Luzón, increasingly acknowledged as key Marxist philosopher and suspected to be member of the clandestine Spanish Communist Party, did not get his contract renewed; it was Canals who took over his lectures. In 1966 he assumed Cátedra de Metafísica, replacing the retired Jaime Bofill; this was the post Canals held for over 20 years, until he retired himself in 1987. In the late 1960s and during unspecified time he headed Departamento de Filosofía Teorética. In the 1970s he co-founded Societá Internazionale Tommasso d’Aquino, rising to president of its <b>Spanish</b> <b>section</b> (1981-1986) and vice-president of its international executive (1991-1997); in the meantime he obtained one more PhD, in theology. In 1989 Canals was nominated to the Vatican-based Pontificia Academia Sancti Thomae Aquinatis. In the 21st century he was awarded doctor honoris causa titles by universities in Manila, Mar del Plata and the Barcelona Universidad CEU. Canals was active as lecturer also beyond the scholarly realm.|$|E

500|$|As {{director}} of the UNIA's newspaper Negro World from 1932, de Mena worked with Jacques-Garvey to create a ladies' page, breaking new ground at the time. Jacques-Garvey had introduced [...] "Our Women and What They Think", with articles focused on women's activism, rather than on fashion or household tips. They used {{the voice of the}} Negro World to give members of the African diaspora a different narrative than the racially-inferior images commonly presented in the press. In the racially charged environment of the 1930s, black women were often depicted as sexually immoral. Through the ladies' page articles, women were encouraged to uplift the race through motherhood; the articles helped to change the perception of Afro-Caribbean women by asserting the women's respectability. In Costa Rica, where they had been denied citizenship, West Indian women argued that they were fit to become citizens. Chapters of UNIA sprang up in countries from Brazil through Mexico and across the West Indies. Though Caribbean migrants to the areas accounted for some of the membership, not all of those interested in Garveyism were immigrants from the West Indies. The Negro World had a <b>Spanish</b> <b>section</b> which ran news about issues affecting Afro-Latinos. Under de Mena's leadership it was decidedly feminist. She exhorted members to fight for women's rights and throw off the restrictions of assigned roles.|$|E

40|$|Paleoecology {{of fossil}} rodents is {{frequently}} inferred from the dental {{pattern of the}} teeth, attributing the habitat conditions of extant rodents to fossil species with similar dental pattern. This technique is common practice {{and has been in}} use for several decades. A relatively new technique is based on the carbon and oxygen isotope composition of the incisor enamel of fossil rodents to reconstruct paleoenvironmental scenarios. We combine these two methods, studying material from two Early Miocene <b>Spanish</b> <b>sections,</b> one in the Mediterranean coastal area and one in Northcentral inland Spain. Comparison of the humidity values obtained by means of these two proxies reveals discrepancies. Therefore, we analyzed the habitat preferences, especially humidity, of extant rodents and found that dental pattern is not very reliable to reconstruct the humidity preferences of fossil rodents and this kind of interpretation has to be taken with caution. We conclude that the isotopic composition of enamel of fossil teeth is a more reliable proxy in the studied sections...|$|R
