50|$|Radio {{acoustic}} ranging had {{its origins}} in a growing understanding of underwater acoustics and their practical application during {{the early decades of}} the 20th century, and developed in parallel with echo sounding. The first step took place in the early 1900s, when the Submarine Signal Company invented a <b>submarine</b> <b>bell</b> signalling device and a hydrophone that could serve as a receiver of the underwater sounds the bells generated. The crew of a ship equipped with the receiving hydrophone could plot their ship′s distance from the <b>submarine</b> <b>bell</b> mechanism and plot intersecting lines from two or more bells to determine the ship′s position. The bells were installed at lighthouses, aboard lightvessels, and on buoys along the coasts of North America and Europe, and receiving hydrophones were mounted aboard hundreds of ships. It was history′s first practical use of acoustics in an ocean environment.|$|E
5000|$|... == North Atlantic {{operations}} == After {{training and}} operations with a <b>submarine</b> <b>bell,</b> Finch sailed from New York 9 August 1919 for Kirkwall, Orkney Islands, Scotland. Here she based {{for two months}} of duty removing the vast number of mines laid in the North Sea during World War I. Finch returned to Charleston on 29 November 1920, and on 3 January 1920 sailed for San Pedro, California, where from 1 March to 29 August she was in reduced commission.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Submarine</b> <b>Bells</b> is {{an album}} by New Zealand group the Chills, {{released}} in 1990. This was the band's first album {{on a major}} label, as Martin Phillips signed to Warner Bros. Records subsidiary Slash Records, to release the album in the U.S. The album reached #1 on the New Zealand album charts and had significant support from American college radio. The album was awarded gold status in New Zealand and represents {{the peak of the}} Chills' popularity at home. It is considered {{to be one of the}} defining albums of the Dunedin Sound. The supporting tour for <b>Submarine</b> <b>Bells</b> culminated in a triumphant home-coming concert in Dunedin Town Hall.|$|R
50|$|Ranson was {{the captain}} of the ship RMS Baltic, which rescued 1600 {{passengers}} and crew from the stricken liner RMS Republic (sailing from New York to Gibraltar and Mediterranean ports) when it collided with the Italian liner Florida in fog off the island of Nantucket, Massachusetts, Saturday, January 23, 1909. <b>Submarine</b> <b>bells,</b> depth sounding, and radio signals were used by Ranson to locate the drifting RMS Republic.|$|R
50|$|The ship {{converted}} into a <b>submarine</b> rescue <b>bell</b> and target ship, and renamed HMS Kingfisher in April 1954.|$|R
50|$|Lightship 106 {{was built}} in 1923 by Bath Iron Works of Bath, Maine for $200,000.00. Lightship 106 was built on a steel hull and {{equipped}} with a 12-inch steam chime whistle, a hand operated bell, a <b>submarine</b> <b>bell,</b> a submarine oscillator, a radio beacon, and a 375 mm electric lens lantern at each mast head. Lightship 106 was placed in relief service following replacement by Lightship 117 in 1931, returned to Nantucket when Lightship 117 was sunk in 1934, and returned to relief service when replaced by Lightship 112 in 1936.|$|E
50|$|The {{introduction}} of the turbine engine {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century gave further subdivision of machinery and increase of economy, whereby greater speed became possible and comfort was increased by the reduction of vibration. At the same time the {{introduction of}} <b>submarine</b> <b>bell</b> signaling tended to diminish the risk of stranding and collision, whilst wireless telegraphy not only destroyed the isolation of the sea but tended to safety, as was seen by the way in which assistance was called out of the fog when the White Star Line liner Republic was sinking as the result of a collision off Martha's Vineyard (1909).|$|E
50|$|The Doctor {{meanwhile}} {{discovers that}} the Master, assisted by a misguided Trenchard, is stealing electrical equipment from the naval base {{to build a}} machine that will control the Sea Devils. The evil Time Lord intends to use the reptiles as an army to enable him to conquer the planet, and he begins by using the machine to summon some {{of them from the}} sea. Soon, however, a battle for the prison ensues, during which Trenchard, who had believed he was aiding his country against enemy agents, is killed. The Doctor and Jo are forced to flee to HMS Seaspite, where Hart tells them a naval submarine has disappeared. The crew prepare to battle the sea devils. The Doctor investigates in a <b>submarine</b> <b>bell</b> and is seized by the Sea Devils, who take him to their leader.|$|E
50|$|Up to 1,300 {{men were}} {{employed}} during the project, of whom {{more than forty}} lost their lives. Shaped 10-tonne blocks of limestone were used to create an outer facing wall, thereby encasing a rubble mound raised from the sea both by dumping from ships and tipping from the shore. Divers in <b>submarine</b> <b>bells</b> created the level foundations on which the tiers of facing stones were placed. These men worked underwater using picks and hammers, and carried out blasting using gunpowder sealed in watertight tin pipes.|$|R
5000|$|In 1990, {{the band}} were signed to a {{worldwide}} record {{deal with their}} music appearing on the Warner Brothers imprint Slash Records in North America. Their 1990 album <b>Submarine</b> <b>Bells</b> included their biggest international hit, the whimsically titled [...] "Heavenly Pop Hit". The tune was also a hit in the US, as it charted at #17 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Chart; it remains their only American chart appearance. The group's follow-up album, 1992's Soft Bomb, featured a totally different Chills line-up (save for Phillipps), and spun off the hit [...] "The Male Monster From The Id".|$|R
5000|$|<b>Submarine</b> <b>Bells</b> was a {{huge success}} in the Chills' home country. It entered the New Zealand album chart at No. 7 in June 1990 and reached No. 1 the {{following}} week, ultimately spending 14 {{weeks on the chart}} in total. The single [...] "Heavenly Pop Hit" [...] was released in July and peaked at No. 2. Elsewhere, however, it made minimal commercial impact. The album did not chart in Australia, the UK, or the U.S., although [...] "Heavenly Pop Hit" [...] achieved some success on the U.S. Alternative Songs chart. [...] "Part Past Part Fiction" [...] was released by Slash as a single in Australia, but did not enter the chart.|$|R
5000|$|Assigned to Division Two (Training and Experimental Division), Submarine Flotilla, Atlantic Fleet, G-3 {{combined}} {{the training of}} new student crews in submarine operations and torpedo firing with experimental work as needed. The latter included harbor net defense deployment drills with tender [...] in June and stationary dives with a <b>submarine</b> rescue <b>bell</b> in the Thames River in September. In late October, G-3 carried out instructional sound work with , a task resumed in early 1918 in company with a succession of submarine chasers and patrol boats.|$|R
50|$|Resuming its {{west coast}} operations, Diodon aided in the {{training}} of Canadian naval air and surface forces out of Esquimalt, British Columbia, from October to December 1952. It returned to the Far East from March to September 1954, again conducting a surveillance patrol in La Perouse Straits from 24 May to 22 June. During its west coast training operations {{in the next two}} years, Diodon again operated with the Canadian Navy, and in March 1956 admitted visitors by means of a <b>submarine</b> escape <b>bell</b> while 130 feet (40 m) below the surface during rescue drills.|$|R
50|$|Upon commissioning, Tringa was {{assigned}} to Submarine Squadron (SubRon) 8 and operated out of the submarine base at New London, Connecticut. During her first six years of active service, she remained close to the eastern seaboard. Fortunately, her services as a submarine rescue vessel were not required. On the other hand, Tringa remained busy practicing simulated submarine rescues and serving as target ship and recovery ship for submarines in torpedo-firing drills. In addition, she participated {{in a number of}} rescue experiments for the Bureau of Ships, testing diving <b>bells,</b> <b>submarine</b> buoys, ground tackle, mooring gear, and related equipment.|$|R
50|$|Diving bells {{have been}} used for {{submarine}} rescue. The closed dry bell is designed to seal against the deck of the submarine above an escape hatch. Water in the space between the <b>bell</b> and the <b>submarine</b> is pumped out and the hatches can be opened to allow occupants to leave the submarine and enter the bell. The hatches are then closed, the bell skirt flooded to release it from the <b>submarine,</b> and the <b>bell</b> with its load of survivors is hoisted back to the surface, where the survivors exit and the bell may return for the next group. The internal pressure in the bell is usually kept at atmospheric pressure to minimise run time by eliminating the need for decompression, so the seal between the bell skirt and the submarine deck is critical to the safety of the operation. This seal is provided by using a flexible sealing material, usually a type of rubber, which is pressed firmly against the smooth hatch surround by the pressure differential when the skirt is pumped out.|$|R
