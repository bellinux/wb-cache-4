40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to evaluate the effects of irrigation and soil management on potato tuber diseases. Supplemental irrigation, soil amendment and crop rotation can improve potato growth and tuber yield under drought stress conditions, but may also increase potato tuber diseases. The effects of irrigation, soil amendment and crop rotation on the incidence of tuber diseases were quantified from 1994 to 1997 in potato plots. Surface sprinkler irrigation was applied each year, based on tensiometer or moisture block readings deployed in field plots. Black <b>scurf</b> (Rhizoctonia solani), black dot (Colletotricchum coccodes), silver <b>scurf</b> (Helminthosporium solani) and common scab (Streptomyces scabei) diseases were quantified on potato tubers randomly sampled at harvest and kept at storage temperature of 7. 2 Â°C before visual disease assessment. The incidence of tuber diseases varied among irrigation treatments, crop rotations and soil amendments. The mean incidence of black <b>scurf,</b> silver <b>scurf</b> and black dot ranged from 3 - 18, 2 - 33 and 4 - 7 %, in best, un-irrigated and reduced irrigation, respectively. The incidence of back <b>scurf,</b> silver <b>scurf</b> and black dot diseases ranged from 2. 4 - 10, 0. 8 - 21 and 1 - 31 % on potato tubers grown in plots under green manure rotation crop (peas/vetch). Disease incidences on tubers were 1 - 28, 0 - 35 and 2 - 16 % for black <b>scurf,</b> silver <b>scurf</b> and black dot, respectively; when potato plants were grown under small-grain rotation. Soil amendments had significant (p< 0. 05) effects on the incidences of silver <b>scurf</b> disease in 1997 and black dot disease in 1996 and 1997. The interactions of soil amendment with irrigation resulted in significant effects on black <b>scurf</b> incidence in 1994. This research implied that water application may lead to increases in some potato tuber diseases, however; crop rotation and soil amendment may reduce the incidences of selective potato tuber diseases, depending on the type, duration or frequency of supplemental irrigation...|$|R
50|$|Soil types {{influenced}} {{the development of}} silver <b>scurf</b> to a great extent, both at harvest season and the following three-month storage period. Some soils displayed suppressiveness in different levels. The results from experimental trials revealed a significant negative correlation between silver <b>scurf</b> disease severity, and soil NO3 content and Fe availability. NO3 had been negatively correlated with silver <b>scurf</b> disease previously. This provides a possible suppressive effect of these two soil components. NO3 is an efficient nitrogen source used by H. solani. Therefore, a direct adverse effect between silver <b>scurf</b> and NO3 {{is not likely to}} happen. A probable explanation for this observation is that NO3 could function on other soil microorganisms which possibly act as H. solani antagonists. These results indicated that microbial antagonists may be the key components contributing to soil suppressiveness and their antagonists may lead efficient biological control of silver <b>scurf.</b>|$|R
50|$|When silver <b>scurf</b> {{was first}} found in Moscow in 1871, it was {{considered}} as a minor plant disease. After an increase in silver <b>scurf</b> incidence from America, Europe, Middle East, Africa, China, and New Zealand since 1968, the disease was later considered a pathogen of major importance. Although the disease did not cause potato yield losses and only affected the cosmetic appearance of the tuber, it had {{a huge impact on}} the potato market. With growing consumer demands for attractive appearance in fresh market cultivars, silver <b>scurf</b> on potatoes with blemishes and discoloration have been rejected by the industry. Furthermore, the silver <b>scurf</b> causes water loss which makes it difficult to peel the tubers. The excess tuber shrinkage also causes weight loss in tubers. From the cosmetic effect, dehydration, and weight loss of the tubers, the fresh market is facing major economic losses from the disease even today. For example, the Idaho's potato industry lost about 7 to 8.5 million dollars from the silver <b>scurf</b> disease. Not only does the cost come from rejecting silver <b>scurf</b> diseased potatoes, but it also comes from an increase in the amount of time needed for sorting and inspecting every potato.|$|R

The efficacy of chemicals, alone and in combination with V. biguttatum was tested in in vitro assays on nutrient agar plates, in bio-assays with minitubers and in the field. Generally, there were both antagonistic, neutral and additive interactions with V. biguttatum among the combinations tested; there were no indications for synergistic interactions. Broad-spectrum fungicides (azoxystrobin, chlorothalonil, thiabendazole) were fungitoxic to V. biguttatum as shown in in vitro assays, and hampered black <b>scurf</b> control by V. biguttatum in bio-assays. Oomycete-specific chemicals (cymoxanil and propamocarb) and various biocontrol strains (Gliocladium spp., Pseudomonas spp. and Trichoderma spp.) did {{not interfere with the}} growth of V. biguttatum on agar nutrient plates and did not affect black <b>scurf</b> control by V. biguttatum in co-applied treatments in the minituber bio-assay.

When combinations of V. biguttatum and cymoxanil or propamocarb were applied to immature potato tubers at green crop lifting, a reduction of both black <b>scurf</b> and Pythium- or Phytophthora-incited tuber rot was observed at harvest. In conclusion, the biocontrol fungus V. biguttatum is compatible with selected chemical control systems and may improve control efficacy in combination with Rhizoctonia-specific fungicides or may extend control spectrum in combination with Oomycete-specific fungicides...|$|R

In addition, the distribution of H. solani in potato fields and the inoculum potential at harvest time were investigated. Disease progress and H. solani spore populations were also characterised under commercial storage conditions.

For foliar application, soluble plant sugar, a natural yucca surfactant and liquefied fish were added as food to the compost tea prior to foliar application. Six treatments were used: untreated control (C); drench compost tea (DCT); foliar food (FF); foliar compost tea (FCT); drench compost tea+foliar food (DCT+FF) and drench compost tea + foliar compost tea (DCT+FCT).

The disease cycle can be divided into two stages: field and storage. It is mainly a seed borne disease and the primary source of inoculum is mainly infected potato seed tubers.
