Although the <b>Senior</b> <b>Loan</b> Officer Opinion Survey uses a small sample and gathers only qualitative information, it proves to be a useful tool in predicting changes in commercial lending and output. The authors find a strong correlation between tighter credit standards and slower loan growth and output, even after controlling for credit demand and other predictors of lending and output. The analysis also shows that the loan officer reports can help predict narrower measures of business activity, including inventory investment and industrial production.

40|$|The {{literature}} {{referring to}} the credit slowdown {{has been plagued by}} the identification problem of whether a decline in a bank’s credit is derived from the demand or the supply side. This paper proposes an original approach in directly estimating the credit demand and the credit supply from survey data. Using the TANKAN and the recently published <b>Senior</b> <b>Loan</b> Officer survey data, the paper demonstrates that the observed lending amount did not change much during the period of study; however, the observed lending amount deviated, as one might expect, from the estimated credit demand and credit supply for every firm size. This credit mismatch presents evidence of credit market imperfections and is of interest for further investigation as a possible explanation of firms ’ liquidity constraints and banks’ lending mechanisms...|$|E

40|$|Our {{investigation}} of banks ’ corporate loan pricing {{policies in the}} United States {{over the past two}} decades finds that monetary policy is an important driver of banks ’ risk-taking incentives. We show that banks charge riskier borrowers (relative to safer borrowers) lower premiums in periods of easy monetary policy than in periods of tight monetary policy. This interest rate discount is robust to borrower-, loan-, and bank-specific factors, macroe-conomic factors and various types of unobserved heterogeneity at the bank and firm levels. Using individual bank information about lending standards from the <b>Senior</b> <b>Loan</b> Officers Opinion Survey (SLOOS), we unveil evidence that the interest rate discount for riskier borrowers in periods of easy monetary policy is prevalent among banks with greater risk appetite. This finding confirms that the loan pricing discount we observe is indeed driven by the bank risk-taking channel of monetary policy. JEL classification: G 2...|$|E
