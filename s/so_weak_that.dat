5|$|Another notable {{king of the}} Anuradhapura Kingdom is Valagamba (103, 89–77 BC), {{also known}} as Vatthagamani Abhaya, who was overthrown by five invaders from South India. He regained his throne after {{defeating}} these invaders {{one by one and}} unified the country again under his rule. Saddha Tissa (137–119 BC), Mahaculi Mahatissa (77–63 BC), Vasabha (67–111), Gajabahu I (114–136), Dhatusena (455–473), Aggabodhi I (571–604) and Aggabodhi II (604–614) were among the rulers who held sway over the entire country after Dutthagamani and Valagamba. Rulers from Kutakanna Tissa (44–22 BC) to Amandagamani (29–19 BC) also managed to keep the whole country under the rule of the Anuradhapura Kingdom. Other rulers could not maintain their rule over the whole island, and independent regions often existed in Ruhuna and Malayarata (hill country) for limited periods. During the final years of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, rebellions sprang up and the authority of the kings gradually declined. By the time of Mahinda V (982–1017), the last king of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, the rule of the king had become <b>so</b> <b>weak</b> <b>that</b> he could not even properly organize the collection of taxes.|$|E
5|$|On 22 May, the fleet—now {{reduced to}} only two ships—rounded the Cape of Good Hope. They arrived in Beseguiche (now Dakar, located near Cape Verde) on 2 June. There they found not only Nicolau Coelho's caravel {{but also the}} nau captained by Diogo Dias—which had been lost {{for over a year}} {{following}} the disaster in the South Atlantic. The nau had experienced several adventures of its own and was now in poor condition with only seven sick and malnourished men aboard—one of whom was <b>so</b> <b>weak</b> <b>that</b> he died of happiness upon again seeing his comrades. Another Portuguese fleet was also found riding at anchor in Beseguiche. After Manuel I had been told of the discovery of what is now Brazil, he sent another and smaller fleet to explore it. One of its navigators was Amerigo Vespucci (for whom the Americas would be named), who told Cabral of his exploration, confirming that he had indeed made landfall on an entire continent and not merely an island.|$|E

25|$|An {{earthquake}} (also {{known as}} a quake, tremor or temblor) is the shaking of {{the surface of the}} Earth, resulting from the sudden release of energy in the Earth's lithosphere that creates seismic waves. Earthquakes can range in size from those that are <b>so</b> <b>weak</b> <b>that</b> they cannot be felt to those violent enough to toss people around and destroy whole cities. The seismicity or seismic activity of an area refers to the frequency, type and size of earthquakes experienced over a period of time.|$|E
25|$|Following Ramesses III's death {{there was}} endless bickering between his heirs. Three {{of his sons}} {{would go on to}} assume power as Ramesses IV, Ramesses VI and Ramesses VIII, respectively. However, at this time Egypt was also {{increasingly}} beset by a series of droughts, below-normal flooding levels of the Nile, famine, civil unrest and official corruption. The power of the last pharaoh, Ramesses XI, grew <b>so</b> <b>weak</b> <b>that</b> in the south the Theban High Priests of Amun became the effective de facto rulers of Upper Egypt, while Smendes controlled Lower Egypt even before Ramesses XI's death. Smendes would eventually found the Twenty-first Dynasty at Tanis.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1827, the 16-year-old Gardner rented and planted {{eighteen}} acres of land, and worked on side jobs between planting and harvest. He went into St. Louis, Missouri on an unsuccessful quest for more work; so he hired on to a keelboat bound for Galena, Illinois, whose captain abandoned him there without pay after he was taken sick with fever. Weak with fever (<b>so</b> <b>weak</b> <b>that</b> he was obliged to lay down several times on his route to gain a little rest), he followed an Indian trail {{that led to a}} cabin owned by a half brother and a cousin in the mining regions near Galena, stumbling upon their place at midnight.

40|$|The {{polarization}} of the CMBR scattered by galaxy clusters in the kinematic Sunyaev Zeldovich effect {{depends on the}} transverse velocity of the cluster. This polarizing effect {{is proportional to the}} transverse velocity squared, and <b>so</b> <b>weaker</b> <b>that</b> the change in intensity due to the radial motion in the kinematic effect. The value given by Sunyaev and Zeldovich, and which is frequently cited, underestimates the polarizing effect by a factor of ten. We show furthermore that the polarization has a strong frequency dependence. This means that the polarization should be detectable with the new generation of CMBR probes, at least for some clusters. Thus this effect offers, almost uniquely, a method of obtaining the vectorial velocity of clusters.

25|$|After Kelly {{returned}} to Hollywood in 1946, MGM had nothing planned and used {{him in a}} routine, black-and-white movie: Living in a Big Way. The film was considered <b>so</b> <b>weak</b> <b>that</b> the studio asked Kelly to design and insert a series of dance routines, and they noticed his ability to carry out such assignments. This led to a lead part in his next picture, with Judy Garland and director Vincente Minnelli— a musical film version of S.N. Behrman's play, The Pirate, with songs by Cole Porter, in which Kelly plays the lead. The Pirate gave full rein to Kelly's athleticism. It is also notable for Kelly's work with The Nicholas Brothers – the leading black dancers of their day – in a virtuoso dance routine. Now regarded as a classic, the film was {{ahead of its time}} but flopped at the box-office.|$|E
25|$|After 1984, the {{franchise}} {{would only have}} one more winning season in Minnesota, in 1985-86. Seemingly, {{the franchise}} hit bottom in 1987-88, when it won only 19 games, still the second-fewest wins in franchise history. However, the Norris Division was <b>so</b> <b>weak</b> <b>that</b> year (only the Red Wings finished with a winning record) that the North Stars and Toronto Maple Leafs were fighting it out for the last playoff spot from the division {{on the last day}} of the season despite having the two worst records in the league. In those days, the four top teams in each division made the playoffs, regardless of record. A loss to the Calgary Flames not only kept the North Stars out of the playoffs, but assured them of the worst record in the league. While the late 1980s saw the franchise draft what would turn out to be their greatest player – forward Mike Modano – chronic attendance problems spurred the owners to threaten to move the club to the San Francisco Bay Area, against the league's wishes.|$|E
25|$|Clausel's and Solignac's {{divisions}} of Junot's corps joined the II Corps and the VI Corps in Marshal André Masséna's 1810 invasion of Portugal. VIII Corps was not engaged during the Battle of Bussaco. When Masséna's army arrived before the Lines of Torres Vedras, Clausel's men {{clashed with the}} defenders in the Battle of Sobral in mid-October. Checked before the Lines, the French army starved and the unsuccessful invasion caused serious losses in VIII Corps. Clausel's division shrank from 6,794 men on 15 September 1810, to 3,610 men on 15 March 1811. By the latter date, the 4th Battalions of the division were <b>so</b> <b>weak</b> <b>that</b> the cadres had to be sent home and the survivors distributed to II Corps units. Solignac's division diminished from 7,226 men on 15 September 1810, to 4,553 men on 15 March 1811. Solignac's division {{was present at the}} Battle of Fuentes de Onoro on 3–5 May 1811. It was not engaged and suffered only two men wounded. After Marshal Auguste Marmont replaced Masséna in command, the army's three corps were suppressed and the troops reorganized into independent divisions. The new 5th and 6th Divisions under Generals of Division Antoine Louis Popon de Maucune and Antoine François Brenier de Montmorand were created from units of VIII Corps and of Loison's VI Corps division.|$|E

25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became <b>so</b> <b>weak.</b> <b>that</b> I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E

Barium-130 undergoes very slow radioactive decay to xenon-130 by double beta plus decay, and barium-132 theoretically decays similarly to xenon-132, with half-lives a thousand times greater than the age of the Universe. The abundance is ~0.1% that of natural barium. The radioactivity of these isotopes is <b>so</b> <b>weak</b> <b>that</b> they pose no danger to life.|$|E
