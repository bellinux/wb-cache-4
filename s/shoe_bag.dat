5000|$|Saving {{weight is}} very {{important}} for travelers, especially when they have to fly. All airlines have strict weight limitations and a pound can make the difference between a free carry-on and a paid check-in bag. Packing cubes are extra light, which makes them a great choice over the traditional travel bags. [...] Another weight-saving trick is to take one of the smaller cubes as the second carry-on instead of paying fees for excessive weight. Many travelers prefer packing cubes because they help them keep their baggage organized. The different sizes of the packing cubes allow travelers to separate toiletries, medications, electronics or underwear from each other. Some people prefer to keep their dirty clothes apart from the clean ones and packing cubes make this a lot easier.One of the toughest things to do while packing for a trip is fitting everything you want to bring with you into your luggage. Our packing cube system fixes that issue by neatly packing all your clothes tightly into our space saving bags.

40|$|From Club to Catwalk: {{fashion in}} 1980 s London is {{a review of}} fashion {{innovation}} in London during a particularly vibrant, creative period. The book {{will focus on the}} fashion design and its related partners of this formative decade during which London’s fashion industry developed into a viable market to showcase promote and sell British fashion. The 1980 s was the decade in which London’s flamboyant, sometimes political often controversial fashions ensured that the city became a truly international fashion capital. While this publication will focus primarily on the fashions created during the decade, through examinations of music, graphic design and the business of fashion, the project aims to chart the social, economic and aesthetic connections made between fashion and the broader culture from the late 1970 s {{to the end of the}} 1980 s. Introduction: Sonnet Stanfill 1. Overview: Sonnet Stanfill The first section will use roughly 20 ensembles from the V&A’s collection as case studies to chronicle London’s development as a fashion city in the 1980 s. These objects will chart the key moments of leading design of the period and will include examples designed by key makers of the period. 2. Womenswear and Menswear sections: Wendy Dagworthy OBE and Sir Paul Smith There will then follow a section on womenswear (author: Wendy Dagworthy), and menswear (Paul Smith) written from the perspective of designers operating at the time. These sections will incorporate the voices of two key practitioners of the period, who will chart the progress of their businesses, both of which became viable and internationally recognised during this decade. 3. Fashion Accessories: Daniel Milford-Cottam Fashion accessories are a vital element in finishing an ensemble. A number of British makers operating in the 1980 s created <b>shoe,</b> <b>bag</b> and hat designs which received international attention. There are a number of examples in the V&A’s own collection which can be highlighted. 4. Fashion illustration, photograph and graphic design: Abraham Thomas Along with the preceding section, this chapter will widen the publication’s focus beyond fashion to the broader culture and will investigate the 2 -D material such as fashion illustration, photography and graphic design created in London during the 1980 s. Examples drawn from the Word and Image Collection will be included. 5. Fashion and Music: Shaun Cole This section will reference London’s vibrant club scene, which was both the site of important sartorial experimentation and the music which served as its vital partner. Areas which may be covered include: Blitz and the New Romantics, The Batcave and the Goths, Beat Route and Latin/funk zootsuits, Taboo and grotesque individuality Rockabilly Revival and others.
