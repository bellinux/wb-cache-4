500|$|Rachel's characterization, {{especially}} her Christmas greed {{even though}} she is Jewish, was singled out for criticism in many reviews. VanDerWerff wrote that the episode [...] " [...] Rachel being really excited about what <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> for Christmas, {{even though she}}'s Jewish", and her end-of episode shout of [...] "Happy Hanukah" [...] a [...] "last minute patch job" [...] to [...] "stay true to the characters as they were at one time". Sullivan also discussed her characterization and noted that she was [...] "a character who makes a point of her Jewish heritage often". He added, [...] "she was basically horrible and played against character the entire episode, so she could eventually realize that she was awful and change her ways." [...] Bell criticized Rachel's list of gifts, such as [...] "spray tan and teeth whitening", as [...] "back to square one" [...] after her nose-job storyline in the second season. Finn's contribution of a charity pig in Jewish Rachel's honor was deemed [...] "wrong on at least two levels" [...] by Chaney.|$|E
2500|$|The strip club's {{security}} officer said that Mangum told co-workers {{four days after}} the party that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> money from some boys at a Duke party who had not paid her, mentioning that the boys were white. The security guard did not make a big deal of it because he felt that no one took her seriously.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him fixedly for several moments. He was half afraid that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> up and leave him. Instead, however, she broke into a hard little laugh, and helped herself to another cigarette.|$|E

60|$|Where <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to?</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> a {{place called}} Roxham; here it was written on the ticket. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{companion}} to a dear young lady, very rich, like all the English, whom she had met when she had travelled with her French family to Jersey, a Miss Lee.|$|R

'And poor dear good woman,' said Alda, 'she {{has such}} a respect for Underwood {{breeding}} and our education, that I believe I could persuade her into anything by telling her it was what she calls [...] "comifo." [...] Even when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the boudoir done with apple-green picked out with mauve, enough to set one's teeth on edge, and Marilda would do nothing but laugh, she let me persuade her into a lovely pale sea-green.' ...|$|E

60|$|Here Mary Erskine {{suddenly}} {{laid her}} head down upon her arms again, on the little work-table before her, and burst into tears. After sobbing convulsively a few minutes she rose, hastily brushed the tears away with her handkerchief, and went toward the door. She then took the water pail, which stood upon a bench near the door, and said that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> some water, at the spring, for tea, {{and that she would}} be back in a moment. She returned very soon, with a countenance entirely serene.|$|E
6000|$|Oh, {{the things}} <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> fond of! The things that her poor, round foolish eyes gloated upon {{the moment that}} she saw them! Joan tried to enlist the shopman on her side, {{descending}} even to flirtation. Unfortunately {{he was a young}} man with a high sense of duty, convinced that his employer's interests lay in his support of Mrs. Phillips. The sight of the furniture that, between them, they selected for the dining- room gave Joan a quite distinct internal pain. They ascended to the floor above, devoted to the exhibition of [...] "Recherche drawing-room suites." [...] Mrs. Phillips's eye instinctively fastened with passionate desire upon the most atrocious. Joan grew vehement. It was impossible.|$|E

5000|$|Barbara fell in {{love with}} him, and had told her father's second wife, Van that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> elope with him. Van, worried about what could happen, told Bruce what <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do, and the elopement was stopped. An infuriated Barbara never forgave Van for her {{so-called}} [...] "interference".|$|R
60|$|But {{now that}} he was walking at her side, all that {{determination}} and assurance melted to perplexed humility. He marched along by his horse with his head down, just feeling the ache of being so close to her and yet so far; angry with his own silence and awkwardness, almost angry with her for her loveliness, and the pain it made him suffer. When they reached the house, and she left him at the stable-yard, saying <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> some flowers, he jerked the beast's bridle and swore at it for its slowness in entering the stable. He, was terrified that she would be gone before he could get into the garden; yet half afraid of finding her there. But she was still plucking carnations by the box hedge which led to the conservatories. And as she rose from gathering those blossoms, before {{he knew what he was}} doing, Harbinger had thrown his arm around her, held her as in a vice, kissed her unmercifully.|$|E
60|$|Dan at once {{agreed to}} {{accompany}} the girl to Mount Pleasant when he heard that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> things for his master. Looking about he found an old basket and they started without delay by the one road from the clearing which led, they had no doubt, to the town. It was about two miles distant, and was really but a large village. A few Federal soldiers from the camp hard by were lounging about the streets, but these {{paid no attention to}} them. Lucy soon made her purchases, and then went to the house that had been pointed out to her as being inhabited by the doctor who attended {{to the needs of the}} people of Mount Pleasant and the surrounding district. Fortunately he was at home. Lucy looked at him closely as he entered the room and took his seat. He was a middle-aged man with a shrewd face, and she at once felt that she might have confidence in it.|$|E
60|$|It warn't no slouch of an idea; and it warn't no slouch of a {{grindstone}} nuther; but {{we allowed}} we'd tackle it. It warn't quite midnight yet, so we cleared {{out for the}} mill, leaving Jim at work. We smouched the grindstone, {{and set out to}} roll her home, but it was a most nation tough job. Sometimes, do what we could, we couldn't keep her from falling over, and she come mighty near mashing us every time. Tom said <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> one of us, sure, before we got through. We got her half way; and then we was plumb played out, and most drownded with sweat. We see it warn't no use; we got to go and fetch Jim. So he raised up his bed and slid the chain off of the bed-leg, and wrapt it round and round his neck, and we crawled out through our hole and down there, and Jim and me laid into that grindstone and walked her along like nothing; and Tom superintended. He could out-superintend any boy I ever see. He knowed how to do everything.|$|E

6000|$|... "I'm {{not finding}} fault with HER, you know," [...] said Champney hastily. [...] "I'm {{not such a}} beastly cad as that; I wouldn't have spoken of my affairs at all, but you asked, you know. I only thought, if <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> herself into trouble on account of that Frenchman, you might talk to her--she'd listen to you, because she'd know you only did it out of {{business}} reasons. And they're really business reasons, you know. I suppose you don't think much of my business capacity, colonel, and you wouldn't go much on my judgment--especially now; but I've been here longer than you and"--he lowered his voice slightly and dragged his chair nearer Courtland--"I don't like the looks of things here. There's some devilment plotting among those rascals. They're only awaiting an opportunity; a single flash {{would be enough to}} set them in a blaze, even if the fire wasn't lit and smouldering already like a spark in a bale of cotton. I'd cut the whole thing and clear out if I didn't think it would make it harder for Miss Dows, who would be left alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we've been {{thinking}} about it for some time--all winter in fact," [...] returned Marilla. [...] "Mrs. Alexander Spencer was up here one day before Christmas and she said <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a little girl from the asylum over in Hopeton in the spring. Her cousin lives there and Mrs. Spencer has visited here and knows all about it. So Matthew and I have talked it over off and on ever since. We thought we'd get a boy. Matthew is getting up in years, you know--he's sixty--and he isn't so spry as he once was. His heart troubles him a good deal. And you know how desperate hard it's got to be to get hired help. There's never anybody to be had but those stupid, half-grown little French boys; and as soon as you do get one broke into your ways and taught something he's up and off to the lobster canneries or the States. At first Matthew suggested getting a Home boy. But I said 'no' flat to that. 'They may be all right--I'm not saying they're not--but no London street Arabs for me,' I said. 'Give me a native born at least. There'll be a risk, no matter who we get. But I'll feel easier in my mind and sleep sounder at nights if we get a born Canadian.' So in the end we decided to ask Mrs. Spencer to pick us out one when she went over to get her little girl. We heard last week she was going, so we sent her word by Richard Spencer's folks at Carmody to bring us a smart, likely boy of about ten or eleven. We decided that would be the best age--old enough to be of some use in doing chores right off and young enough to be trained up proper. We mean to give him a good home and schooling. We had a telegram from Mrs. Alexander Spencer today--the mail-man brought it from the station--saying they were coming on the five-thirty train tonight. So Matthew went to Bright River to meet him. Mrs. Spencer will drop him off there. Of course she goes on to White Sands station herself." ...|$|E
