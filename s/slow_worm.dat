40|$|Cattle grazing {{is being}} used {{increasingly}} by landowners and statutory conservation bodies to manage heathlands in parts of mainland Europe and in the UK, where it is called 'conservation grazing'. Between 2010 and 2013, cattle were excluded from six hectares of lowland heath, in southern England, that had been subject to annual summer cattle grazing between May 1997 and autumn 2009. Changes in grass snake Natrix natrix, common lizard Zootoca vivipara, <b>slow</b> <b>worm</b> Anguis fragilis and sand lizard Lacerta agilis numbers were recorded annually in the ungrazed area and in a four hectare area of heathland adjacent to it that continued to be grazed. The number of grass snake, common lizard and <b>slow</b> <b>worm</b> sightings were significantly higher in the ungrazed heath than the grazed heath and were associated with increased habitat structure, resulting principally from increased height and cover of grasses, particularly Molinia caerulea. Conversely, {{there was no significant}} difference in the number of adult sand lizard sightings between the grazed and ungrazed heath though sighting frequency was inversely correlated with both grass and grass litter cover. Our results suggest that the use of cattle grazing as a management tool on lowland heath is detrimental to grass snake, <b>slow</b> <b>worm</b> and common lizard populations but may be less so to adult sand lizards. Although newborn slow worms and common lizards were observed throughout the study area, significantly fewer were found in the grazed areas than the ungrazed areas.

40|$|This thesis {{reviews the}} {{availability}} and suitability of non-invasive samples for examining genetic diversity of reptiles. Such samples were {{used to examine the}} phylogeography of British snakes, namely Natrix natrix, Vipera berus and Coronella austriaca. In addition, Anguis fragilis was used as a model reptile {{to assess the impact of}} land development and consequent habitat loss on present day reptile populations. For the first time, we demonstrate that snake faecal, egg and foetal tissues, as well as sloughed skin and carcasses, are valuable sources of non-invasively sampled (NIS) material permitting genetic studies with minimal disturbance to the individual and its population. Using mitochondrial cytochrome b primers, 500 and 758 bp length sequences were successfully amplified from a variety of NIS tissues. Furthermore, a new method was developed for obtaining snake faeces in the field. Non-invasively collected samples supplied sufficient quality DNA to reconstruct cyt b mtDNA phylogenetic histories for V. berus (434 bp), C. austriaca (141 bp) and N. natrix (265 bp). Median spanning networks, Bayesian inference and Neighbour joining analyses grouped all three British snake species within Italian lineages. V. berus showed greater genetic variability (5 haplotypes) than the other two monophyletic British snake species. It is likely that V. berus survived in British Younger Dryas refugia whilst both C. austriaca and N. natrix retreated to more southerly European refugia. Using the common <b>slow</b> <b>worm,</b> Anguis fragilis, as a model species, the impact of land development on present day reptile populations was calculated by accessing the success of established translocation protocols. During monitoring, we achieved a <b>slow</b> <b>worm</b> recapture rate of 24 % with all animals maintaining or increasing body condition in the first year following translocation. We recommend a minimum of 5 year post-translocation monitoring of receptor site with preferably four receptor site visits per year. This number of visits is a compromise between ideal recapture rate and mitigation costs. The effect of parasitic load on translocated <b>slow</b> <b>worm</b> populations was investigated though the first British record and field study of Neoxysomatium brevicaudatum (83 % prevalence, n= 100). Increased parasite load negatively affected <b>slow</b> <b>worm</b> body condition with parasitic loads varying amongst host populations. We discuss the value of post-translocation monitoring and disease surveillance as an important conservation tool in preserving threatened reptile species...|$|E
40|$|Little {{quantitative}} {{ecological information}} {{exists on the}} diets of most invertebrate feeding reptiles, particularly nocturnal or elusive species {{that are difficult to}} observe. In the UK and elsewhere, reptiles are legally required to be relocated before land development can proceed, but without knowledge of their dietary requirements, the suitability of receptor sites cannot be known. Here, we tested the ability of non-invasive DNA-based molecular diagnostics (454 pyrosequencing) to analyse reptile diets, with the specific aims of determining which earthworm species are exploited by slow worms (the legless lizard Anguis fragilis) and whether they feed on the deeper-living earthworm species that only come to the surface at night. <b>Slow</b> <b>worm</b> faecal samples from four different habitats were analysed using earthworm-specific PCR primers. We found that 86 % of slow worms (N = 80) had eaten earthworms. In lowland heath and marshy/acid grassland, Lumbricus rubellus, a surface-dwelling epigeic species, dominated <b>slow</b> <b>worm</b> diet. In two other habitats, riverside pasture and calciferous coarse grassland, diet was dominated by deeper-living anecic and endogeic species. We conclude that all species of earthworm are exploited by these reptiles and lack of specialization allows slow worms to thrive {{in a wide variety of}} habitats. Pyrosequencing of prey DNA in faeces showed promise as a practical, rapid and relatively inexpensive means of obtaining detailed and valuable ecological information on the diets of reptiles...|$|E

40|$|Prevalence and {{intensity}} of parasitic infections are often higher in male than in female vertebrates. This bias may represent either differences between host sex in exposure or susceptibility to parasites. The former {{may be due to}} sex-specific behaviour of the host, including differential habitat use or diet. Differences in susceptibility are often regarded as a negative effect of male sex steroid hormones on the immune system. Host–parasite dynamics are of great interest in terms of reptile survival, ecology and conservation. We used, for the first time, molecular diagnostics to track nematode parasitism in wild populations of reptiles noninvasively. Using slow worms (Anguis fragilis) as a model species, we investigated the interacting effects of time of year, sex, length, weight and climatic variables on the prevalence of the gastroenterological parasitic nematode Neoxysomatium brevicaudatum. Faeces were collected from three sites over 2 years. There was an interaction between sex and time of year, with lower nematode prevalence in males than in females in July or August (different between years) but a high prevalence in males in April. As the latter is during the <b>slow</b> <b>worm</b> breeding season, this {{may be the result of}} testosterone-induced immunosuppression. A second-order interaction between <b>slow</b> <b>worm</b> length and weight was found to be significant, with a positive association between prevalence and body condition in young slow worms and a negative association in older slow worms. The convex pattern of nematode prevalence with age that emerged suggests an increase with age-related exposure and a decrease with age-related acquired immunity...|$|E
40|$|Landscape {{genetics}} {{was developed}} to detect landscape elements shaping genetic population structure, including the effects of fragmentation. Multifarious environmental variables can influence gene flow in different ways and expert knowledge is frequently used to construct friction maps. However, {{the extent of the}} migration and the movement of single individuals are frequently unknown, especially for non-model species, and friction maps only based on expert knowledge can be misleading. In this study, we used three different methods: isolation by distance (IBD), least-cost modelling and a strip-based approach to disentangle the human implication in the fragmentation process in the <b>slow</b> <b>worm</b> (Anguis fragilis), as well as the specific landscape elements shaping the genetic structure in a highly anthropized 16  km 2 area in Switzerland. Friction maps were constructed using expert opinion, but also based on the combination of all possible weightings for all landscape elements. The IBD indicated a significant effect of geographic distance on genetic differentiation. Further approaches demonstrated that highways and railways were the most important elements impeding the gene flow in this area. Surprisingly, we also found that agricultural areas and dense forests seemed to be used as dispersal corridors. These results confirmed that the <b>slow</b> <b>worm</b> has relatively unspecific habitat requirements. Finally, we showed that our models based on expert knowledge performed poorly compared to cautious analysis of each variable. This study demonstrated that landscape genetic analyses should take expert knowledge with caution and exhaustive analyses of each landscape element without a priori knowledge and different methods can be recommended...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Detection of <b>slow</b> <b>worms</b> is {{particularly}} challenging {{due to the}} stealthy nature of their propagation techniques {{and their ability to}} blend with normal traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose a distributed detection approach based on the Generalized Evidence Processing (GEP) theory, a sensor integration and data fusion technique. With GEP theory, evidence collected by distributed detectors determine the probability associated with a detection decision under a hypothesis. The collected evidence is combined to arrive at an optimal fused detection decision by minimizing a cummulative decision risk function. Typically, malicious traffic flows of varying scanning rates can occur in the wild, and the difficulty in detecting <b>slow</b> scanning <b>worms</b> in particular can be exacerbated by interference from other traffic flows scanning at faster rates. Our proposed detection technique uses a window-based self adapting profiler to filter detected malicious traffic profiles with scanning rates greater than the low scanning rates we are interested in.
