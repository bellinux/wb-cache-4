"Damien" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as a satire on religion, faith and the nature of good and evil, as well as a commentary on commercialism and the cult of celebrity in American culture. Parker said the writers sought to satirize the speed and ease at which the followers of Jesus lose faith in him and bet against him. Religious writer Michel Clasquin said the abandonment of Jesus demonstrates, [...] "Like many people in the real world, the faith of the town's people cannot withstand the hard times." [...] Parker said, [...] "Everybody puts their trust in Satan and ends up getting screwed. There is a bigger message – all in all, a pretty wholesome message. That's why South Park works. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a message." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Saadiq, [...] "Just One Kiss" [...] can be {{interpreted}} as a song devoted to a female love interest, [...] "but I'm really talking about music and what it did for me. That one guitar line, that certain drum beat, how it turned my life into a ball of gold." [...] The song incorporates cinematic strings, xylophone, and a rolling crescendo. The ballad [...] "Calling", featuring Mexican balladeer Rocio Mendoza, draws on Motown's late 1950s R roots and doo-wop music, and incorporates Latin style guitar, and Spanish language lyrics. [...] "Staying in Love", an uptempo rhythm and blues song, was written by Saadiq after he thought of an ex-girlfriend. Incongruous with its 1960s-inspired sound, [...] "Let's Take a Walk" [...] has sexually forward lyrics and , which the narrator uses to bluntly proposition his love interest. The midtempo [...] "Never Give You Up" [...] is fashioned in Motown's early 1970 sound and, unlike other songs on the album, also incorporates elements from more modern soul music. [...] "Sometimes", which was inspired by Saadiq's upbringing in a tough neighborhood in Oakland, is about dealing with the fatigue of universal hardships when they are worsened by the burden of racism. The line [...] "now I know what they meant by 'keep your head to the sky'" [...] makes reference to Earth, Wind & Fire, whose music Saadiq immersed himself in while growing up. Saadiq said of the song's message, [...] "That's just giving dap to my moms and grandmother and the people who raised me in the neighborhood to let them know its easy but not as easy as it seems all the time and <b>sometimes</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to back up and cry but I'm just giving thanks to the people that helped me along the way." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{was known}} for his essays, most {{particularly}} The Power of the Powerless, in which he described a societal paradigm in which citizens were forced to [...] "live within a lie" [...] under the communist regime. In describing his role as a dissident, Havel wrote in 1979: [...] "...we never decided to become dissidents. We have been transformed into them, without quite knowing how, <b>sometimes</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> ended up in prison without precisely knowing how. We simply went ahead and did certain things that we felt we ought to do, and that seemed to us decent to do, nothing more nor less." ...|$|E

2500|$|Executive {{producer}} Rick Berman {{said that}} when creating , he had to obey the rules as set out by franchise creator Gene Roddenberry, and compared the normal Starfleet officers to that of Boy Scouts. Berman suggested that [...] "In the Pale Moonlight" [...] was the exception. Taylor said that the episode [...] "pushes the boundaries in a realistic way". In an interview in 2011, when talking about [...] "In the Pale Moonlight", Robinson compared Starfleet to Americans in general. He said [...] "we're not really {{willing to take the}} consequences of our actions, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to do very dirty things, and we have to hurt people, and we pretend that that doesn't exist, that Americans would never do that. We dealt with issues like that and I don't think... you know... the other shows really went as far as we did." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "Ladyboy" [...] was {{the first}} song written by the duo. [...] "Golden Shower" [...] and [...] "Skills in Pills" [...] are songs based on Lindemann's {{personal}} experiences. Referring to the latter, he commented: [...] "I {{grew up in the}} eastern part of Germany and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> booze of course, but <b>sometimes</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> these 'pills parties', where we put shit together. We collected stuff, because it was hard to get medication, and then <b>we</b> <b>had</b> like medication orgies which was really strange." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "We may buy the tobacco," [...] Mikail said. [...] "Every man has {{something}} for his work. They pretend it {{is half the}} value of the work we do, but of course we know better than that. Still we all get something each day, and can spend it as we like. I don't think they allow smoking in the western prisons, but they do in all those east of Irkutsk. The authorities encourage it, indeed, for it is considered healthy and keeps away fever. There are no fevers in summer, but in winter, from so many men being shut up together, the air gets bad and <b>sometimes</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> outbreaks of fever." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, when it {{has settled}} down. It is the change that I do not like. Of course, <b>sometimes</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{only a few days}} of {{moderately}} rough weather; but occasionally there is a hurricane at the break up, and a hurricane in the bay of Bengal is no joke. I shall not mind, much, if we get fairly past the Andamans; for from there to the mouth of the Hooghly it is open water, and I should be under no uneasiness as to the brig battling her way through it; but to be caught in a hurricane, with these patches of islands and rocks in the neighbourhood would, to say the least, be awkward." ...|$|E
6000|$|They ran us for hours. The forest seemed interminable. We kept to the glades {{as much as}} possible, {{but they}} always ended in more thick forest. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>we</b> thought <b>we</b> <b>had</b> escaped, {{and sat down to}} rest; but always, before we could recover our breath, we would hear the hateful [...] "Whoo-whoo!"

60|$|We went {{slipping}} silently along, {{between the}} green and fragrant banks, {{with a sense of}} pleasure and contentment that grew, and grew, all the time. Sometimes the banks were overhung with thick masses of willows that wholly hid the ground behind; <b>sometimes</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> noble hills on one hand, clothed densely with foliage to their tops, {{and on the other hand}} open levels blazing with poppies, or clothed in the rich blue of the corn-flower; <b>sometimes</b> <b>we</b> drifted in the shadow of forests, and sometimes along the margin of long stretches of velvety grass, fresh and green and bright, a tireless charm to the eye. And the birds!--they were everywhere; they swept back and forth across the river constantly, and their jubilant music was never stilled.|$|R
5000|$|Combining {{classical}} orchestration with mechanical sounds, May's work on Mad Max {{is notable}} for its distinctive soundscape that {{interacts with the}} film's diegetic sounds. [...] "Mad Max was a strongly energized score in the violence/action department, and for that they wanted a totally non-melodic score," [...] explained May. [...] "It was very jagged and shearing, and George particularly wanted me to antagonize the audience by making them feel uncomfortable. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> jagged notes going against dialog so that the audience would feel frustrated." [...] Such effects were developed {{through the application of}} stingers by way of brass and percussion instruments.|$|R

Besides, as a rule we take care that we are so strong that they see, at once, that resistance would be hopeless. Sometimes they bring armed guards with them.

60|$|You will observe then, {{that there}} follows upon the schedule, {{a quarter of}} an hour marked G. That initial stands for General Exercise, and when it arrives each pupil is to lay aside her work, and attend to any {{exercise}} which may be proposed. This quarter of an hour is appropriated to a great variety of purposes. Sometimes I give a short and familiar lecture on some useful subject connected with science or art, or the principles of duty. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a general reading lesson. Sometimes we turn the school into a Bible class. Again the time is occupied in attending to some general business of the school. The bell is rung one minute before the close of the time, and when the period appropriated to this purpose has actually expired, the Study Card, for the first time in the morning, is let entirely down, and the room is at once suddenly transformed into a scene of life and motion and gaiety.|$|E
60|$|We {{always have}} twin cities, {{or at the}} utmost stage of {{coalescence}} a city with two wards, Red End and Blue End; we mark the boundaries very carefully, and our citizens have so much local patriotism (Mr. Chesterton will learn with pleasure) that they stray but rarely over that thin little streak of white that bounds their municipal allegiance. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> an election for mayor; {{it is like a}} census but very abusive, and Red always wins. Only citizens with two legs and at least one arm and capable of standing up may vote, and voters may poll on horseback; boy scouts and women and children do not vote, though there is a vigorous agitation to remove these disabilities. Zulus and foreign-looking persons, such as East Indian cavalry and American Indians, are also disfranchised. So are riderless horses and camels; but the elephant has never attempted to vote on any occasion, and does not seem to desire the privilege. It influences public opinion quite sufficiently as it is by nodding its head.|$|E
60|$|However, I {{preserved}} {{the youth of}} my temper, was always bright, pleasant in company, and agreeable to everybody, or else everybody flattered me; and in this condition I came abroad to the world again. And though I was not so popular as before, and indeed did not seek it, because I knew it could not be, yet I was far from being without company, {{and that of the}} greatest quality (of subjects I mean), who frequently visited me, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> meetings for mirth and play at my apartments, where I failed not to divert them in the most agreeable manner possible.|$|R
50|$|Among {{other things}} we were {{surprised}} {{to find out that}} the OC are very hard to reach by phone. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to dial 5 different numbers before getting any response at all. Then we were either redirected to another number or asked to call later etc. It is a very vivid example of how difficult it would be to reach an OC from any penitentiary institution, where phone calls are limited. Only one OC (!) was willing to exercise control over adherence to the election rights of the convicts by direct observation of the voting process in Kholodnohirsk CF №18. All the rest never gave it a second thought.|$|R
5000|$|The party's {{structure}} {{is similar to}} that of Ulster loyalist groups in Northern Ireland, insofar as the group has a political wing backed up by a paramilitary action force (named [...] "Britain First Defence Force"). The action force's members assume titles such as [...] "provost marshal", and a document written by Jim Dowson said that [...] "I have lived in the worst trouble spots of Belfast; I have had high powered machine gun fire rip bricks from my house and have been injured by grenade attack. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to defend our homes from the traditional enemy, other times from the forces of the state, the police and army." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have been}} so long looking forward to {{arriving}} at Attegrat, that, being here, I feel that I have made a long stage into the interior of Abyssinia. I confess, however, that I am disappointed in Attegrat. It is foolish, I own. I ought by this time to have learnt the utter hollowness and emptiness of all statements connected with the country; and everything we have been told, everything we have been led to expect, has alike turned out utterly incorrect. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> been told pleasant things, <b>sometimes</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> been threatened with dire calamities; but {{in both cases the}} vaticinations have turned out equally incorrect. Guinea-worms and tape-worms, fever and cholera, small-pox and dysentery, tetse-fly and sunstroke—all these have been distinguished by their absence: but as a counterbalance, so have Colonel Phayre’s green fields and gushing springs at Zulla, his perennial water between Sooro and Rayray Guddy, and his emporium of commerce at Senafe, which turned out a village of six mud-huts. Still, in spite of previous disappointments, I confess I clung to the idea that I should find a town of considerable size at Attegrat. The place was marked in Roman capitals upon the maps. It had been spoken of as a town flowing with milk and honey; it was to be one of our main halting-places; and altogether one certainly did expect to find rather more than twenty hovels, a barn called a church, and another ruinous barn which was once a palace. But before I describe Attegrat, let me detail my journey here from Goun-Gonna. I sent my baggage off at seven o’clock in the morning, {{at the same time that}} the baggage of the head-quarters of the 33d and Colonel Penn’s battery of mountain guns started. I then explored the pretty valley I described in my last, and afterwards went into a friend’s tent and finished my letter to you. At twelve o’clock I started for what I was told was an eleven miles’ ride; but it turned out the longest sixteen I have ever ridden. Every officer and man to whom I have spoken—and among others I may quote Colonel Milward and Colonel Penn of the Artillery, and Major Cooper, and all the officers of the 33d—agreed with me that it was over sixteen miles. Colonel Phayre’s and the quartermaster’s departments’ gross miscalculation of distances is becoming a very serious nuisance. It is absolutely cruel upon the men. If soldiers are told that they have a sixteen miles’ march across a rough country, and beneath a hot sun, they will do the distance. It may be hard work; but they know when they start what is before them, and they make up their minds to it. But when they are told it is eleven miles, at the end of that distance they begin to look out anxiously for their camping-place. They become cross and impatient, and are infinitely more fatigued than they would have been had they been told the real distance that was before them.|$|E
6000|$|... "This year {{our home}} {{is up in}} the Old Pasture," [...] replied Reddy. [...] "We have the nicest kind of a house dug in the ground {{underneath}} a big rock. It has only one entrance, but this is {{because there is no}} need of any other. No one could possibly dig us out there. Last year our home was on the Green Meadows and there were three doorways to that. The year before we dug our house in a gravelly bank just within the edge of the Green Forest. The babies are born in a comfortable bedroom deep underground. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a storeroom in addition to the bedroom; there Mrs. Reddy and I can keep food when there is more than can be eaten at one meal. When the babies are first born in the spring and Mrs. Reddy cannot leave them, I take food to her. When the youngsters are big enough to use their sharp little teeth, we take turns hunting food for them. Usually we hunt separately, but sometimes we hunt together. You know often two can do what one cannot. If Bowser the Hound happens to find the trail of Mrs. Reddy when there are babies at home, she leads him far away from our home. Then I join her, and take her place so that she can slip away {{and go back to the}} babies. Bowser never knows the difference.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Amelius; [...] "I wish I did. Well, we {{received}} her, on her arrival, in the Common Room--called so {{because we all}} assemble there every evening, when {{the work of the}} day is done. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> the reading of a poem or a novel; sometimes debates on the social and political questions of the time in England and America; sometimes music, or dancing, or cards, or billiards, to amuse us. When a new member arrives, we have the ceremonies of introduction. I was close by the Elder Brother (that's the name we give to the chief of the Community) when two of the women led Miss Mellicent in. He's a hearty old fellow, who lived the first part of his life on his own clearing in one of the Western forests. To this day, he can't talk long, without showing, in one way or another, that his old familiarity with the trees still keeps its place in his memory. He looked hard at Miss Mellicent, under his shaggy old white eyebrows; and I heard him whisper to himself, 'Ah, dear me! Another of The Fallen Leaves!' I knew what he meant. The people who have drawn blanks in the lottery of life--the people who have toiled hard after happiness, and have gathered nothing but disappointment and sorrow; the friendless and the lonely, the wounded and the lost--these are the people whom our good Elder Brother calls The Fallen Leaves. I like the saying myself; it's a tender way of speaking of our poor fellow-creatures who are down in the world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose not," [...] said Mr. Sellyer, with a condescending smile. [...] "But of course, madam," [...] he went on, {{falling into}} the easy chat of the fashionable bookman, [...] "such {{mistakes}} are bound to happen <b>sometimes.</b> <b>We</b> <b>had</b> a very painful case only yesterday. One of our oldest customers came in in a great hurry to buy books {{to take on the}} steamer, and before we realised what he had done--selecting the books I suppose merely by the titles, as some gentlemen are apt to do--he had taken two of last year's books. We wired at once to the steamer, but I'm afraid it's too late." ...|$|R
60|$|These {{arrangements}} {{had occupied}} the general attention advantageously for all, though (as I {{expressed in the}} last sentence) they ended in a sorrowful feeling. I now said {{a few words to}} my fellow-voyagers {{on the subject of the}} small stock of food on which our lives depended if they were preserved from the great deep, and on the rigid necessity of our eking it out in the most frugal manner. One and all replied that whatever allowance I thought best to lay down should be strictly kept to. We made a pair of scales out of a thin scrap of iron-plating and some twine, and I got together for weights such of the heaviest buttons among us as I calculated made up some fraction over two ounces. This was the allowance of solid food served out once a-day to each, from that time to the end; with the addition of a coffee-berry, or sometimes half a one, when the weather was very fair, for breakfast. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> nothing else whatever, but half a pint of water each per day, and <b>sometimes,</b> when <b>we</b> were coldest and weakest, a teaspoonful of rum each, served out as a dram. I know how learnedly it can be shown that rum is poison, but I also know that in this case, as in all similar cases I have ever read of--which are numerous--no words can express the comfort and support derived from it. Nor have I the least doubt that it saved the lives of far more than half our number. Having mentioned half a pint of water as our daily allowance, I ought to observe that <b>sometimes</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> less, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> more; for much rain fell, and we caught it in a canvas stretched for the purpose.|$|R
