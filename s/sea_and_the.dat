5|$|Many {{streams and}} 11,000 lakes {{are found in}} Belarus. Three major rivers run through the country: the Neman, the Pripyat, and the Dnieper.

40|$|A coupled {{model is}} {{developed}} {{to investigate the}} dynamic interaction between an offshore pile, a porous <b>seabed</b> <b>and</b> seawater when subjected to the pseudo-Stoneley wave along <b>the</b> <b>seabed</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> seawater interface. <b>The</b> pile <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>seabed</b> are treated as the porous medium governed by Biot's theory, while the seawater is considered as an acoustic medium and is described by the conventional Helmholtz equation. The free field solution of the incident pseudo-Stoneley wave is obtained using Biot's theory <b>and</b> <b>the</b> potential method. Based on the boundary element method (BEM) for <b>the</b> porous medium <b>and</b> <b>the</b> acoustic medium, three BEM formulations are constructed for <b>the</b> pile, <b>the</b> <b>seabed</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> seawater, respectively, which are combined together using the continuity conditions between <b>the</b> pile, <b>the</b> <b>seabed</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> seawater to formulate the coupled model for the system.

5|$|Along {{with land}} trade routes, a Maritime Silk Road {{contributed to the}} flow of goods and {{establishment}} of a Pax Mongolica.

Eventually these routes further developed encompassing the Arabian Sea, Persian Gulf, Red <b>Sea,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sea off East Africa.|$|E
5|$|Antarctica {{is divided}} in two by the Transantarctic Mountains {{close to the}} neck between the Ross <b>Sea</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Weddell Sea.

5|$|At the {{headland}} at Grenen, {{the northernmost}} point of Denmark, the North <b>Sea</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Baltic Sea meet. Because of their different densities, a clear dividing {{line can be}} seen. As a result of turbulent seas, beachings and shipwrecks were common. These frequent losses combined with the town's strategic location as the gateway to the Baltic led to Skagen being the site of one of Denmark's earliest lighthouses, Vippefyr, a lever light constructed in 1627.

The Nile River meanders in the far distance, emptying its seven arms into the Mediterranean at the Nile Delta. South of Cyprus is the Sinai Peninsula, which forms a land bridge between Africa and Southwest Asia. The Red Sea lies beyond, eventually merging – as the mountain ranges to its left and right do – with the curved horizon.|$|E

At the end of the war, Moltke was interned with the majority of the High Seas Fleet at Scapa Flow while the ships' fate was being discussed during peace treaty negotiations. The ships were scuttled on 21June 1919 to prevent their seizure by the Allies.|$|E

5|$|During Simeon's rule, Bulgaria {{spread over}} a {{territory}} between the Aegean, the Adriatic and the Black <b>Sea,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> new Bulgarian capital Preslav was said to rival Constantinople. The newly independent Bulgarian Orthodox Church became the first new patriarchate besides the Pentarchy, and Bulgarian Glagolitic and Cyrillic translations of Christian texts spread all over the Slavic world of the time. It was at the Preslav Literary School in the 890s that the Cyrillic alphabet was developed. Halfway through his reign, Simeon assumed the title of Emperor (Tsar), having prior to that been styled Prince (Knyaz).|$|E
