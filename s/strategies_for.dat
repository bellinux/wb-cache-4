5|$|Nonviolent Communication {{is based}} on the idea that all human beings have the {{capacity}} for compassion and only resort to violence or behavior that harms others when they do not recognize more effective <b>strategies</b> <b>for</b> meeting needs. Habits of thinking and speaking that lead to the use of violence (psychological and physical) are learned through culture. NVC theory supposes all human behavior stems from attempts to meet universal human needs and that these needs are never in conflict. Rather, conflict arises when <b>strategies</b> <b>for</b> meeting needs clash. NVC proposes that if people can identify their needs, the needs of others, and the feelings that surround these needs, harmony can be achieved.|$|E
