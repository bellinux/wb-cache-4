50|$|In {{the central}} {{wardrobes}} {{there are two}} refined flax drapes embroidered in silk and gold, part of a collection dedicated to the “history and virtues” of Saint Thomas Aquinas, donated to the Dominicans by his descendant Maria d’Aquino in 1799. The first drape portrays a young girl caressing an unicorn, a mythic creature which, according to the legend, could only be touched by a virgin, thus representing chastity. The other, on the opposite wall, “The Sun Chariot”, represents an interesting subject mixing religious and mythological themes. The drapes were realized by Neapolitan embroiderers between 1669 and 1685, and were used, in the past, as wall decorations during some religious holy days connected with St. Thomas. The collection also includes other drapes, such as “Benevolence”, “God’s grace”, “Humility” and “Peace hugging Justice”, all characterized by rich baroque flower compositions. The artists responsible for these works used a refined technique called “PUNTO PITTURA”, to get a particular light and <b>shade</b> <b>effect.</b> On the north-east wall, others papier-mâché busts include: Saint Agnes of Rome, patron of girlfriends and virgins; St. Raymond of Peñyafort , the first doctor in canonical law; Saint Louis Bertrand, represented with a snake coming out from the goblet he holds in his hand, remembering the episode when he almost died from poison.|$|E

Kizanti have mesomorphic builds, red eyes with black oval-shaped pupils, and no earlobes. Kizanti hate the Phentari and fought a war with them once that almost wiped the Phentari out. They dislike the Alliance for intervening and protecting the Phentari.Ferron is a [...] "Shade World", a cross-dimensional planet {{in and out of}} phase with our dimension. As a side-effect of their evolution, the Kizanti have learned to dimensionally [...] "displace" [...] themselves, making themselves invisible and intangible at will. They carry a ritual marker they are attuned to that they leave behind while phasing to help center themselves for the return jump. This can be anything from a [...] "pet rock" [...] to a 1963 Pontiac Tempest The Kizanti were originally a primitive race of hunter/gatherers. They were protected by the <b>Shade</b> <b>effect,</b> which hid their world from outsiders. A Phentari expedition to the Karanies system discovered the world when it was in-phase and conquered and enslaved the population. Before they left, they massacred them so they couldn't tell Alliance authorities about their actions - a time called the Great Carnage by the survivors. Afterwards, a survival of the fittest mentality took over the race, which weeds out weak offspring so that only [...] "true" [...] Kizanti can live to pass on their genes. They spend their lives training as warriors and assassins, with little time for leisure activities. They have unknown patrons that provide training and support - probably in exchange for their services. The Kizanti favor aggressive or provocative clothing that is designed to attract attention. They are adept at many types of weapons, but prefer using ritual high-quality bladed weapons that are covered in richly inlaid engravings (especially when killing Phentari). Warriors wear their hair in a short, stiff mohawk to indicate their status. Kizanti assassins have prosthetic earlobes, implanted contact lenses, and wear their hair long so they can pass for Human. Although the Kizanti have no unified racial language (speaking one of many regional languages with local dialects instead) and have no indigenous written language, they speak and read a form of Eridani as a common tongue (taught to them by their hidden patrons, no doubt).|$|E

Laminae and stems of defined ages were harvested periodically from the D 8 treatment, and after 8 and 16 weeks the D 4 and D 8 canopies were sampled in 10 -cm strata for analysis of dry matter digestibility (DMD). Shading to 60 and 40 % sunlight decreased the DMD of the green panic and the mixed swards by up to 10 - 12 percentage units in the D 8 treatment. The <b>shade</b> <b>effect</b> on DMD was smaller in the D 4 treatment. Shading increased leaf bulk density in the upper strata of the grass and mixed swards. The <b>shade</b> <b>effect</b> on sward DMD was due to a decrease in DMD of lamina and stem of green panic and, in the lower canopy, also to a decrease in leaf: stem ratio of the grass. The lower DMD of green panic was associated with lower total soluble carbohydrate and higher lignin in the shaded tissues. The concurrent decrease in cell wall content of green panic under shade (as a balance to higher crude protein) indicates that shade must have greatly reduced the digestibility of the cell wall material.

30|$|Dispersed {{nanosphere}} lithography (NSL) {{is one of}} {{the best}} candidates to fabricate identical gold nanoparticles on a large area of glass substrate for LSPR in a mass productive way [7 – 9], because in LSPR, each metal nanoparticle serves as a separate emission element and thus periodicity is not required as long as they are evenly distributed. In dispersed NSL, metal film is evaporated in one to several times at different directions onto the nanospheres dispersed on the substrate, and the gold is subsequently dry etched. Due to the <b>shade</b> <b>effect</b> of the nanospheres, metal nanostructures are left on the substrate after the removal the nanospheres. Dispersed NSL can be used to acquire numerous shapes of metal nanostructures for tuning the peak wavelength and sensitivity of LSPR signal; however, its dry etching process increases the cost of LSPR chip, and glass or gold might contaminate the chamber of the expensive etching equipment such as argon milling or inductively coupled plasma (ICP) machine. To circumvent this problem, this paper demonstrates the approach to predict and fabricate gold nanostructures for LSPR by wet etching.|$|E

Natural light can help reduce the electrical demand and the associated sensible cooling load due to artificial lighting.

This paper investigates the <b>shading</b> <b>effects</b> due to nearby obstructions when daylighting schemes are being employed. We used the computer simulation tool, EnergyPlus, to illustrate the energy performance of a generic commercial building with daylighting controls obstructed by neighbouring buildings of various heights. Analysis of electricity savings was carried out for the perimeter zones of the whole building and individual floors. Regression techniques were conducted to correlate the building energy savings and the angles of obstructions. It was found that the <b>shading</b> <b>effects</b> due to nearby obstructions strongly affect the building energy budget when daylighting designs are used.

Soil or cement dust were applied on peach trees growing in a Mediterranean {{area with the}} above climatic characteristics. Soil and cement dust accumulation onto the leaves decreased the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) available to the leaves without causing any <b>shade</b> <b>effect.</b> Soil and mainly cement dust deposition onto the leaves decreased stomatal conductance, photosynthetic and transpiration rates, and water use efficiency due possibly to stomatal blockage and other leaf cellular effects. In early autumn, rain events removed soil dust and leaf functions partly recovered, while cement dust created a crust partially remaining onto the leaves and causing more permanent stress. Leaf characteristics were differentially affected by the two dusts studied due to their different hydraulic properties. Leaf total chlorophyll decreased and total phenol content increased with dust accumulation late in the summer compared to control leaves due to intense oxidative stress. The two dusts did not cause serious metal imbalances to the leaves, except of lower leaf K content. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelber...|$|E
