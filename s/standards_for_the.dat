5|$|Eye {{color is}} {{considered}} a subset of coloring, and coat color definitions often include <b>standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> eyes, as many genes which control eye color will also affect the coat color or vice versa.

Ruby refers to eyes which at a glance appear black but which are on closer observation a deep, dark red.|$|E

5|$|Some {{studies have}} found that deep frying in olive and {{sunflower}} oils {{has been found to be}} less of a detriment to health and in some cases have positive effects on insulin levels. Oil can be reused a few times after original use after straining out solids. However, excessive use of the same oil can cause it to break down and release compounds into the food that may be carcinogenic, affect liver health, or influence the body's ability to absorb vitamins. Some European countries have set public health <b>standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> safety of frying oil.|$|E

The law 19 Frimaire An VIII (10 December 1799) defined the metre in terms of this value and the kilogramme as being 18827.15 grains.

5|$|A French-inspired {{initiative}} for international cooperation in metrology {{led to the}} signing in 1875 of the Metre Convention. Initially the convention only covered <b>standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> metre and the kilogram. A set of 30 prototypes of the metre and 40 prototypes of the kilogram, in each case made of a 90% platinum-10% iridium alloy, were manufactured by the British firm Johnson, Matthey & Co and accepted by the CGPM in 1889. One of each was selected at random to become the International prototype metre and International prototype kilogram that replaced the mètre des Archives and kilogramme des Archives respectively. Each member state was entitled to one {{of each of the}} remaining prototypes to serve as the national prototype for that country.|$|E
5|$|After Fan {{was forced}} to step down from his office, Wang Anshi (1021–1086) became Chancellor of the {{imperial}} court. With the backing of Emperor Shenzong (1067–1085), Wang Anshi severely criticized the educational system and state bureaucracy. Seeking to resolve {{what he saw as}} state corruption and negligence, Wang implemented a series of reforms called the New Policies. These involved land value tax reform, the establishment of several government monopolies, the support of local militias, and the creation of higher <b>standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Imperial examination to make it more practical for men skilled in statecraft to pass.|$|E

5|$|IUPAC was {{established}} in 1919 as the successor of the International Congress of Applied Chemistry {{for the advancement of}} chemistry. Its members, the National Adhering Organizations, can be national chemistry societies, national academies of sciences, or other bodies representing chemists. There are fifty-four National Adhering Organizations and three Associate National Adhering Organizations. IUPAC's Inter-divisional Committee on Nomenclature and Symbols (IUPAC nomenclature) is the recognized world authority in developing <b>standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> naming of the chemical elements and compounds.

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the Maine Coon's {{popularity}} {{began to decline}} {{with the introduction of}} other long-haired breeds, such as the Persian, which originated in the Middle East. The last recorded win by a Maine Coon in a national cat show for over 40 years was in 1911 at a show in Portland, Oregon. The breed was rarely seen after that. The decline was so severe that the breed was declared extinct in the 1950s, although this declaration was considered to be exaggerated and reported prematurely at the time. The Central Maine Cat Club (CMCC) was created in the early 1950s by Alta Smith and Ruby Dyer in attempts to increase the popularity of the Maine Coon. For 11 years, the CMCC held cat shows and hosted exhibitions of photographs of the breed and is noted for creating the first written breed <b>standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Maine Coon.|$|E

Community programs such as PIRO have helped to improve community <b>standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Hawaiian monk seal.
