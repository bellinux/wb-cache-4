40|$|During {{the period}} April 1991 to March 1992, data {{concerning}} the condemnation rate of standard, vegetarian, and free-range chickens were collected and summarized from one federally inspected abattoir in Ontario. The {{purpose of this study}} was to discuss the effects of diet, management, and breed of chickens on pathological lesions, ensuing condemnation rates, and consequent losses to the growers and the poultry industry. The data collected at this abattoir revealed that vegetarian chickens showed a higher condemnation rate (5. 23 %) for disease and nondisease conditions compared with standard (1. 48 %) and free-range (0. 94 %) chickens. Free-range chickens were approximately two weeks older than vegetarian and <b>standard</b> <b>chickens</b> at the time of slaughter. The most common causes of condemnation in vegetarian chickens was cellulitis (1. 18 %), followed by ascites (0. 77 %).

The LSCC-H 32 cells were demonstrated to be as susceptible {{for most of the}} tested viruses as were secondary chicken embryo cells. Both produced comparably sized virus plaques. The titers of Sindbis and Semliki Forest viruses in LSCC-H 32 cells were 5 - to 40 -fold higher than in secondary chicken embryo cells or BHK- 21 cells, respectively. Furthermore, exogenous chicken standard interferon was titrated in the LSCC-H 32 cells, and a 50 % plaque titer reduction of the challenging vesicular stomatitis virus was achieved by 0. 12 IU of a <b>standard</b> <b>chicken</b> interferon preparation. Endogenous chicken interferon could not be induced by treatment of the cells with polyinosinic acid-polycytidylic acid.

40|$|Objectives: The {{antimicrobial}} susceptibility of Campylobacter strains {{isolated from}} standard and free-range broilers in 1992 – 1996 and 2001 – 2002 was studied. Methods: Strains were isolated from caeca or skin samples collected from standard or free-range broilers arriving in slaughterhouses. The MICs of ampicillin, nalidixic acid, enrofloxacin, tetracycline, erythromycin and gentamicin {{were determined by}} agar dilution and compared according to species (Campylobacter jejuni or Campylobacter coli), production system and sampling period. Results: Results showed that all chickens harboured Campylobacter. An increase over time of the C. coli/C. jejuni ratio for <b>standard</b> <b>chickens</b> occurred. A wide range of MICs was observed among iso-lates from the same broiler or from the same farm. Strains collected on entry to the slaughterhouse and after storage showed {{no significant difference in}} their antibiotic resistance. C. coli was more resistant than C. jejuni to tetracycline and erythromycin during the first period and to all tested mole-cules (except gentamicin) during the second period. Strains isolated from <b>standard</b> <b>chickens</b> were also more often resistant than those isolated from free-range broilers. The percentage of C. jejuni strains resistant to ampicillin decreased from 1992 – 1996 to 2001 – 2002, whereas no change could be observed for the other antimicrobial agents. However, for C. coli the resistance to ampicillin, nalidixic acid, enrofloxacin, tetracycline and erythromycin significantly increased.

40|$|Salmonella and Campylobacter are {{undesirable}} pathogens on poultry. Therefore {{the effect}} of fermented feed on the colonization in the gastro-intestinal tract of the chicken, the introduction of both bacteria in a chicken flocks, and the transmission between chickens was studied. Broilers that were fed with fermented feed were significantly less susceptible for Salmonella and Campylobacter than chickens on a <b>standard</b> <b>chicken</b> feed. The spread of Salmonella between broiler chickens was reduced. However, the results also showed, like for other known control measures, that this feed can not absolutely guarantee the absence of Salmonella and Campylobacter. Therefore fermented feed {{must be seen as}} one of the hurdles in a so called multiple hurdle strategy. The combination of different hurdles should prevent the introduction and transmission. The effect of fermented feed on Campylobacter and Salmonella is partially caused by the presence of high concentrations of organic acids. In chickens fed with liquid feed the acidic barrier {{in the first part of}} the GI-tract was clearly improved. Besides organic acids there are other changes in the GI-tract. Changes in colonization levels of indicator organisms, changes in levels of organic acids and an increased pH in ileum and ceacum. These changes indicate a stabilised GI-flora in fermented feed fed poultry. The research confirmed that by changes in the composition of the feed (carbohydrates, acids, or micro-organisms) the GI-health can be promoted and therewith can contribute to the control of food pathogens in farmed animals...|$|E
40|$|Previously, overall protein {{assimilation}} {{after the}} ingestion of a pure protein meal was studied. In this study, the kinetics of protein assimilation in humans were investigated after the ingestion {{of a complex}} meal, which more closely represents a physiologically normal situation. Overall protein assimilation in humans after the ingestion of a pancake meal, containing 12 g of fat, 27 g of carbohydrate, and 19 g of protein, was evaluated in 26 normal volunteers. Both the egg white and yolk of L-[1 -(13) C]-leucine-substituted eggs were {{used to make the}} batter. The labeled eggs were produced by feeding laying hens a <b>standard</b> <b>chicken</b> diet supplemented with 3 g/kg of L-[1 -(13) C]-leucine (99 %, mol:mol). High enrichment levels of protein with adequate labeling patterns were obtained in eggs from laying hens fed the L-[1 -(13) C]-leucine-substituted diet. The isotopic enrichment of leucine at plateau was equal in egg white and yolk. The overall tracer recovery in egg proteins was 22. 5 %. The overall protein assimilation parameters in subjects that consumed the pancake meal did not differ from those obtained in subjects that consumed a single protein meal (mean cumulative (13) C recovery/ 6 h = 17. 22 +/- 4. 74 %, with a maximal (13) C recovery/h of 5. 65 +/- 1. 48 %, which was attained 145 +/- 25 min after ingestion of the meal). The pancake test meal prepared with eggs intrinsically labeled with L-[1 -(13) C]-leucine is ideal for the study of protein assimilation. The incorporation of differently labeled substrates into a single test meal allows the assessment of different gastrointestinal processes in the overall assimilation of proteins. status: publishe...|$|E

Chicken manure is one of our by-products which is disregarded and sell cheaply (five baht per six kilograms) to middlemen who sell it to fertilizer factories. The factory sells their fertilizers three to seven baht per kilogram. To increase our profitability and generate the effective fertilizer to farmers for developing Thailand’s agriculture, we have planned to establish Neugjamnong Fertilizer under Neungjamnong Company to produce and sell fertilizers that are derived from our by-products. The amount of additional funding, that we need to invest in our capital assets, run business and generate net profits of 4. 1 million baht in the second year, is three million baht. This business plan is created to plan our business strategic, operating, marketing and a financial scheme based on the realistic market. The Company Neungjamnong Fertilizer is a pelleted bio-organic fertilizer producer for the crop grown in Thailand. The company is located in Chonburi, Eastern Thailand which is one of most significant industrial and agricultural province in Thailand. It has rubber, sugarcane, pineapple, cassava plantation and rice farming. The project leader is Natthaphat Neungjamnong who is good at business management and micro-organism understanding that is an advantage for business. The propose of our company is to encourage the growth of agricultural fundamentals of Thailand, organic farming and consumer health as well as help farmers to make more profitability. The Product Our non-chemical fertilizer is developed specifically from natural ingredients and organic compost with effective micro-organism for maximising the productivity of plantation, increase crop yield and boost the growth of the plant. The main ingredient of our fertilizer is poultry faeces that is from our <b>standard</b> <b>chicken</b> farms. Our product is processed from the mix between chicken manure, effective micro-organisms (EM) and dolomite lime. Although our bio-organic fertilizer's price is slightly higher when compared with normal organic fertilizer, bio-organic fertilizer is more effective than organic fertilizer due to micro-organism. Our product is created in pellets that are no unpleasant odour, easily to store and use with the fertilizer spreader. This fertilizer’s formula is appropriated for crops such as rubber, cassava and sugarcane. We have planned to create three more products which are specific to another type of plants and lunch each product every six months. Corporate Strategy To attract target customers who own over 50 rai (19 acres) of the plantation in Thailand, we plan to introduce our reasonable price fertilizers to farmers, provide free trials to customers who are interested in our products for 0. 4 acres during a cycle of harvest and also give one-kg free fertilizers to attendants at agricultural events. Moreover, we have planned to promote our fertilizers through a website, Social Media, magazines and agricultural events to increase brand recognition and brand awareness. Our strategy will help {{to reduce the risk of}} the company and make the company be successful that is confirmed by our sales projection.

The breed's name is derived from Ohio's nickname of [...] "Buckeye state", and their mahogany color is said ideally to resemble the seeds of the Ohio Buckeye plant (Aesculus glabra). They are a dual-purpose chicken that have a decent laying ability and strong meat production characteristics. Buckeyes are yellow skinned chickens that lay brown eggs.|$|R
50|$|With males {{weighing}} 8.5 pounds (3.9 kilos) and hens 6.5 pounds (3 kilos), the Delaware is {{a medium}} sized breed. They have rather large, bright red colored single combs and wattles. Delawares {{appear in a}} single color type: a white body and breast, with light black barring {{on the ends of}} the hackle, wings and tails. It is similar to the Columbian color seen in some breeds, but has barring in the dark portions, rather than uniform black. Also of note is that all feathers have a white quill and shaft, which, combined with yellow skin, makes for a cleaner appearing carcass. Like most <b>standard</b> breeds of <b>chicken,</b> the Delaware has a miniaturized bantam version; however, these are rarely seen.|$|R

A DNA histogram normally consists of a mixture of one or more constellations of G 0 /G 1 -, S-, G 2 /M-phase cells, together with internal standards, debris, background noise, and one or more populations of clumped cells. We have modelled typical DNA histograms as a mixed distribution with Gaussian densities for the G 0 /G 1 and G 2 /M phases, an S-phase density, assumed to be uniform between the G 0 /G 1 and G 2 /M peaks, observed with a Gaussian error, and with Gaussian densities for <b>standards</b> of <b>chicken</b> and trout red blood cells. The debris is modelled as a truncated exponential distribution, and we also have included a uniform background noise distribution over the whole observation interval. We have explored a new approach for maximum-likelihood analyses of complex DNA histograms by the application of the EM algorithm. This algorithm was used for four observed DNA histograms of varying complexity. Our results show that the algorithm works very well, and it converges to reasonable values for all parameters. In simulations from the estimated models, we have investigated bias, variance, and correlations of the estimates...|$|R

Park et al. (2002) achieved 973 % to 100 % accuracies in identify-ARTICLE IN PRESSline. For poultry plants to meet government food safety regulations while maintaining their competitiveness to satisfy consumer demand, FSIS has required the carcasses using images at the 434, 517, 565, and 628 nm wavelengths.

The hyperspectral imaging system consisted of an electron-multiplying charge-coupled-device (EMCCD) camera and an imaging spectrograph. The imaging system acquired line-scan images of chicken carcasses as they passed through the pixel-wide vertical linear field of view. The chickens were hung on a closed-loop laboratory processing line moving at a speed of 70 birds per minute. The use of light-emitting-diode (LED) line lights was selected following comparative evaluation of LED and quartz–tungsten–halogen (QTH) line lights. From analysis of wholesome and systemically diseased chicken spectra, four key wavelengths for differentiating between wholesome and systemically disease...|$|R
