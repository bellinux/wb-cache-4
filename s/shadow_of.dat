Riders to the Sea was performed at the same venue in February the following year. The <b>Shadow</b> <b>of</b> the Glen, under the title In the <b>Shadow</b> <b>of</b> the Glen, formed part of the bill for the opening run of the Abbey Theatre from 27 December 1904 to 3 January 1905. Both plays were based on stories that Synge had collected in the Aran Islands, and Synge relied on props from the Aran Islands to help {{set the stage for}} each of them. He also relied on Hiberno-English, the English dialect of Ireland, to reinforce its usefulness as a literary language, partly because he believed that the Irish language could not survive.|$|E
