To {{reduce the}} {{production}} cost of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) and disposal amount of excess sludge simultaneously, {{volatile fatty acids}} (VFAs) from alkaline excess <b>sludge</b> <b>fermentation</b> was used as carbon sources to synthesize PHA by unenriched mixed cultures.

Four VFAs liquids obtained {{was used to test}} the influence of initial carbon load and carbon to nitrogen ratio (C:N ratio) on the VFAs uptake rate, PHA storage rate and biomass growth rate. Results show that higher initial carbon substrate load results in relatively higher VFAs uptake rate and higher PHA storage rate, while higher initial C:N ratio results in relatively lower biomass growth rate from VFAs.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to perform multielemental {{determinations}} of volatile organometal(loid) compounds (VOMs) in environmental gases such as landfill gas and sewage <b>sludge</b> <b>fermentation</b> gases. The analytical method focuses on the on-line coupling of capillary GC with ICP-TOF-MS and provide excellent separation as well as sensitive element selective detection.   It involves a cryotrapping step for these (VOMs) such as hydrides, methylated and permethylated species of e. g. As, Sb, Sn, Bi, Hg, Pb etc.   In-house standards were generated in Tedlar ® bags and a classical external calibration (R 2 > 0. 99) was applied. The precision of injections was good (RSD = 3 - 11 %, N= 10) and the standards were reproducibly generated (RSD = 3. 20 %, N= 3). A total number of 4 landfill sites and 5 sewage sludge treatment sites were sampled.   One landfill site contained 15 different Sn-compounds, 5 species of which had a concentration of more than 13 ng/l, with a maximum concentration of 1050 ng/l for Me 4 Sn.   Overall, the concentration range of most of the Sn-compounds was 0, 01 - 0, 5 ng/l and some unknown species could also be identified.   In addition, the permethylated species of As, Se, Sb and Bi could be detected in the range of 0, 01 – 117 ng/l.   Although their concentration was usually relatively low (at 0, 01 – 0, 09 ng/l), the variety of volatile Sn-compounds in the <b>sludge</b> <b>fermentation</b> gas samples was quite astonishing.   Me 3 Bi and Me 3 Sb were the dominant species in the <b>sludge</b> <b>fermentation</b> gases at concentrations of up to 42 ng/l.

Stirring and heating the sludge as well as increasing SRT improved the PS fermentation, producing a large amount of soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD). The influence of each operational parameter on PS hydrolysis was observed clearly. A great performance on SCOD production was obtained when the PS was stirred and heated for 3 days. However, PS concentration did not affect the <b>fermentation.</b> <b>Sludge</b> agitation is a simple process with minimal energy consumption. Warming the sludge is very interesting in those plants with anaerobic digestion, where heat energy is obtained from biogas.

40|$|Abstract. In {{previous}} studies (part I) {{it has been}} established that methane fermentation of chromium-free tannery wastes results in partly stabilised post-fermentation sludges, rich in nitrogen and phosphorus. This part of the investigations have confirmed that {{in view of the}} quality of fertilising material, the composting of post-fermentation sludges is most beneficial; and composting of non-fermented wastes is less beneficial. The <b>sludges</b> from short <b>fermentation</b> (only partly stabilised) and after prolonged fermentation were sub-jected to composting. The composting of sludges allowed to obtain material, rich in basic fertilising components and organic soil-forming components. The paper shows {{that it is possible to}} reduce the arduousness of direct composting (with the omission of fermenta-tion) of chromium-free tannery wastes.

At pH 11. 0, 60 ?XC and fermentative time of 7 d, the VFAs yield was 258. 65 mgTOC/gVSS. To restrain cell growth during PHA production, the released phosphorus and residual ammonium in the fermentative VFAs was recovered by the formation of struvite precipitation.

40|$|Methane {{production}} rate (MPR) in {{waste activated sludge}} (WAS) digestion processes is typically limited by the initial steps of complex organic matter degradation, leading to a limited MPR due to <b>sludge</b> <b>fermentation</b> speed of solid particles. In this study, a novel microbial electrolysis AD reactor (ME-AD) was used to accelerate methane production for energy recovery from WAS. Carbon bioconversion was accelerated by ME producing H- 2 at the cathode. MPR was enhanced to 91. 8 gCH(4) /m(3) reactor/d in the microbial electrolysis ME-AD reactor, thus improving the rate by 3 times compared to control conditions (30. 6 gCH(4) /m(3) reactor/d in AD). The methane production yield reached 116. 2 mg/g VSS in the ME-AD reactor. According to balance calculation on electron transfer and methane yield, the increased methane production was mostly dependent on electron contribution through the ME system.

40|$|Waste-derived {{acetic acid}} (HAc) is an {{attractive}} feedstock for microbe-mediated biofuel production. However, fermentative conversion of HAc from waste-activated sludge (WAS) has low yield {{because of the high}} concentration of proteins not readily utilizable by microorganisms without prior hydrolysis. We investigated a combined technology for HAc augmentation during <b>sludge</b> protein <b>fermentation.</b> The maximal HAc yield increased over two-fold, reaching 0. 502 +/- 0. 021 g/g protein (0. 36 +/- 0. 01 g COD/g COD, similar to 52 % of the total volatile fatty acids) when synthetic sludge protein was heated at 120 degrees C for 30 min, treated at pH 12 for 24 h, and fermented at pH 9 for 72 h. Comprehensive analysis illustrated that the heat-alkaline pretreatment significantly induced protein fragmentation, simultaneously increasing the efficiency of protein biohydrolysis (from 35. 5 % to 85. 9 %) by inducing conformational changes indicative of protein unfolding. Consequently, the native alpha-helix content was decreased from 67. 3 % to 32. 5 % by conversion to an unordered shape, whose content increased from 27. 5 % to 45. 5 %; disulfide bonds were cleaved, whereas the main S-S stretching pattern was altered from gauche-gauche-gauche to gauche-gauche-trans, consequently causing increased protein susceptibility to proteolytic hydrolysis (76. 3 % vs. 47. 0 %).

The IVDMD increased significantly when the fermentation followed by enzymatic process. Overall results showed that the best fermentation of POS was obtained by using A. niger NRRL followed by enzymatic process in room temperature for two days. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the research was to study the utilization of fungi and yeast on sugarcane <b>sludge</b> <b>fermentation.</b> The treatments of the first experiment were P 0 = sugarcane sludge without fermentation; P 1 = fermentation by Saccharomyces cereviceae; P 2 = fermentation by Aspergillus oryzae; P 3 = fermentation by Aspergillus niger; P 4 = fermentation by Rhizopus orryzae.  Treatments were arranged in a Completely Randomised Design.   The treatments of the second experiments were R 0 = basic rations, R 1 = R 0 + 5 % fermented of sugarcane sludge, R 2 = R 0 + 10 % fermented of sugarcane sludge, R 3 = R 0 + 15 % fermented of sugarcane sludge, R 4 = R 0 + 20 % fermented of sugarcane sludge.    Treatments have significant effects (P< 0. 05) on VFA and NH 3 parameters.   Based on these parameters, fermentation of sugarcane sludge using Saccharomyces cereviceae had better results compared to others. The treatments had significant effect (P< 0. 05) on NH 3, and based on polynomial orthogonal test the treatments had linear curve of Y= 4, 035 + 0, 237 X. However, treatments had no significant effects on VFA and organic matters digestibility. The dry matters digestibility parameters were significantly affected (P< 0. 05), and the curve response was linear with equation of Y= 45, 964 - 0, 294 X.

40|$|Cadmium (Cd) {{is present}} in {{significant}} levels in waste activated sludge, but its potential toxicities on anaerobic fermentation of sludge remain largely unknown. This work therefore aims to provide such support. Experimental {{results showed that the}} impact of Cd on short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) production from sludge anaerobic fermentation was dose-dependent. The presence of environmentally relevant level of Cd (e. g., 0. 1 mg/g VSS) enhanced SCFA production by 10. 6 %, but 10 mg/g VSS of Cd caused 68. 1 % of inhibition. Mechanism exploration revealed that although all levels of Cd did not cause extra leakage of intracellular substrates, 0. 1 mg/g VSS Cd increased the contents of both soluble and loosely-bound extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), thereby benefitting sludge solubilization. On the contrary, 10 mg/g VSS Cd decreased the levels of all EPS layers, which reduced the content of soluble substrates. It was also found that 0. 1 mg/g VSS Cd benefited both the hydrolysis and acidogenesis but 10 mg/g VSS Cd inhibited all the hydrolysis, acidogenesis, and methanogenesis processes. Further investigations with microbial community and enzyme analysis showed that the pertinent presence of Cd enhanced the activities of protease, acetate kinase, and oxaloacetate transcarboxylase whereas 10 mg/g VSS Cd decreased the microbial diversity, the abundances of functional microbes, and the activities of key enzymes. Finally, one strategy that could effectively mitigate the adverse impact of high Cd levels on SCFA production was proposed and examined. This work provides insights into Cd-present <b>sludge</b> <b>fermentation</b> systems, and the findings obtained may guide engineers to manipulate sludge treatment systems in the future.

40|$|Noosa WWTP is {{publicly}} owned and privately operated by Australian Water Services. The process includes primary sedimentation, raw <b>sludge</b> <b>fermentation,</b> biological nutrient removal (BNR), sand filtration and ultraviolet (UV) disinfection. An innovative {{feature of the}} plant is the supplementary carbon dosing facility to avoid the use of metal salts (alum or ferric) for phosphorus removal. The average flow treated during 2000 was 9. 0 ML/d. The annual 50 percentile effluent quality requirements for nutrients are total N < 5 mg/L and total P < 1 mg/L. The objectives of this project were to: {{determine the cause of}} variability in phosphorus removal; develop a strategy to control the variability in phosphorus removal; and minimise the operating cost of supplementary carbon dosing while achieving the effluent quality requirements. An investigation of chemical and microbiological parameters was implemented and it was concluded that there were several factors causing variability in phosphorus removal, rather than a single cause. The following four major causes were identified, and the control strategies that were adopted resulted in the plant achieving annual 50 percentile effluent total P = 0. 37 mg/L and total N = 3. 0 mg/L during 2001. First, phosphorus removal was limited by the available VFA supply due to consumption of VFA by other organisms competing with phosphate accumulating organisms (PAO), and due to diurnal variations in the sewage VFA and phosphate concentrations. Therefore, supplementary carbon dosing was essential to make allowance for competing reactions. Second, increasing the fermenter VFA yield via supplementary carbon dosing with molasses was found to be an effective and economic way of ensuring reliable phosphorus removal. Third, nitrate in the RAS resulted in consumption of VFA by denitrifying bacteria, particularly with process configurations where the RAS was recycled directly into the anaerobic zone. Incorporating a RAS denitrification zone into the process rectified this problem. Finally, glycogen accumulating organisms (GAO) were observed in BNR sludge samples, and consumption of VFA by GAO appeared to cause decreased phosphorus removal. Better phosphorus removal was obtained using VFA derived from the fermenter than dosing an equivalent amount of acetic acid. It was hypothesized that GAO have a competitive advantage to use acetate and PAO have a competitive advantage to use propionate, butyrate or some other soluble COD compound in the fermenter effluent. Contrary to popular belief, acetate may not be the optimum VFA for biological phosphorus removal. The competition between PAO and GAO for different VFA species under anaerobic conditions requires further investigation in order to control the growth of GAO and thereby improve reliability of biological phosphorus removal processes...|$|E
40|$|This study {{applied a}} {{multi-level}} contact oxidation process {{system in a}} pilot-scale experiment to treat automobile painting wastewater. The experimental wastewater had been pre-treated {{through a series of}} physicochemical methods, but the water still contained a high concentration of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and had poor biodegradability. After the biological treatment, the COD concentration of effluent could stay below 300 mg/L. The study analyzed the effects of hydraulic residence time (HRT) on COD, ammonia nitrogen (NH 4 +-N), and total nitrogen (TN). The optimal HRT was 8 h; at that time, removal efficiencies of COD, ammonia nitrogen, and total nitrogen were 83. 8 %, 86. 3 %, and 65 %, respectively. The system also greatly reduced excess sludge production; the removal efficiency was 82. 8 % with a HRT of 8 h. The study applied high-throughput pyrosequencing technology to evaluate the microbial diversity and community structures in distinct stages of the biological reactor. The relevance between process performance and microbial community structure was analyzed at the phylum and class level. The abundant Firmicutes made a large contribution to improving the biodegradability of painting wastewater through hydrolysis acidification and reducing <b>sludge</b> production through <b>fermentation</b> in the biological reactor...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of the study was}} to {{evaluate}} the effects of mechanical sludge disintegration for enhancing full scale anaerobic digestion of municipal sludge. Batch disintegration tests and lab dewatering tests were also performed aiming at determining the release of organic compounds and assessing the impact of disintegration of excess <b>sludge</b> before the <b>fermentation</b> process of mixed sludge on the dewaterability of post-fermented sludge, respectively. In the study a disc disintegrator driven by a motor with a power of 30 kW, revolutions n = 2950 rpm has been used. It was shown that with increase of energy consumed in the disintegration, the increased amounts of organic compounds were released from the sludge. It was also documented that the introduction of the excess sludge disintegration prior to fermentation tank, resulted in a significant increase in biogas production (by an average of 33. 9 %) and in increase in volatile total solids reduction in the fermented sludge (by an average of 22. 7 %). Moreover, the obtained results indicate the possibility of obtaining a higher degree of sludge dewatering, which was subjected to anaerobic stabilization with using disintegrated excess sludge...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of fertilization with fresh sewage sludge {{with the addition}} of calcium oxide and lignite ash in the proportions dry mass 6 : 1, 4 : 1, 3 : 1 and 2 : 1 on the content of chromium and copper in plants and soil and uptake of these elements was investigated in pot experiment. Sewage sludge were taken from Siedlce (<b>sludge</b> after methane <b>fermentation)</b> and Łuków (<b>sludge</b> stabilized in oxygenic conditions), eastern Poland. The chromium content in the biomass of the test plants (maize, sunflower and oat) was higher following the application of mixtures of sewage sludge with ash than of the mixtures with CaO. The copper content in plants most often did not significantly depend on the type of additives to the sludge. Various amounts of additives to the sewage sludge did not {{have a significant effect on}} the contents of either of the studied trace elements in plants. The contents of chromium and copper in soil after 3 years of cultivation of plants were higher than before the experiment, but these amounts were not significantly differentiated depending on the type and the amount of the used additive (i. e.
