5|$|Following graduation, Mercury {{joined a}} series of bands and sold {{second-hand}} clothes in the Kensington Market in London with girlfriend Mary Austin. He also held a job at Heathrow Airport. Friends from the time remember him as a quiet and shy young man who showed {{a great deal of}} interest in music. In 1969 he joined the Liverpool-based band Ibex, later renamed Wreckage. He lived briefly in a flat above the Liverpool pub, The Dovedale Towers. When this band failed to take off, he joined a second band called <b>Sour</b> <b>Milk</b> Sea. However, by early 1970 this group had broken up as well.|$|E
25|$|For <b>sour</b> <b>milk</b> based okroshka, well {{shaken up}} natural sour milk(often with the {{addition}} of seed oil) is used {{with the addition}} of pure water and ground garlic. Sometimes manufactured kefir is used instead of natural <b>sour</b> <b>milk</b> for time saving reasons, though some say it detracts from the original taste of okroshka.|$|E

40|$|Unpasteurised {{fresh and}} souring dairy {{products}} form {{an essential component}} of household diets throughout many rural communities in southern Africa. The presence of milk-borne zoonotic pathogens such as Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis), the causative agent of bovine tuberculosis and zoonotic tuberculosis in humans, constitute a public health threat, especially in remote areas with poor disease surveillance in livestock and highly compromised human health due to HIV/AIDS. In this study we used culture to determine the longevity of M. bovis in experimentally inoculated fresh and naturally <b>souring</b> <b>milk</b> obtained from communal cattle in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa. The effect of bacterial load and storage temperature on the survival of M. bovis was evaluated by spiking mixtures of fresh <b>milk</b> and starter <b>soured</b> <b>milk</b> (aMasi) culture with three concentrations of bacteria (10 (2), 10 (4), 10 (7) colony forming units/ml), followed by incubation under controlled laboratory conditions that mimicked ambient indoor (20 °C) and outdoor (33 °C) temperatures and periodic sampling and testing over time (0 - 56 days). M. bovis cultured from samples of the fresh and <b>souring</b> <b>milk</b> was identified by PCR analysis. At the highest spiking concentration (10 (7) cfu/ml), M. bovis survived for at least 2 weeks at 20 °C; but, at all concentrations in the 33 °C treatment, M. bovis was absent by three days after inoculation. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the effects of bacterial concentration and time since inoculation, as well as determine the potential half-life of M. bovis in raw <b>souring</b> <b>milk.</b> Given the most favourable tested conditions for bacterial survival (20 °C), approximately 25 % of mycobacteria were alive after one day of storage (95 % CI: 9 - 53 %), giving an estimated half-life of M. bovis in raw <b>souring</b> <b>milk</b> of approximately 12 hours (95 % CI: 7 - 27 hours). This study demonstrates that M. bovis may survive in fresh and <b>souring</b> <b>milk</b> for periods of time that represent a risk of exposure to people consuming these products, as well as domestic or wild animal populations that have reported opportunities to consume homemade unpasteurised dairy products. The temperature at which the <b>milk</b> is <b>soured</b> and stored substantially affects the survival time of M. bovis...|$|R
25|$|Šaltibarščiai - cold borscht is {{a summer}} soup based on beets and milk kefir or <b>sour</b> <b>milk,</b> colored a {{shocking}} pink. It {{is made with}} cooked or pickled shredded beets and various other chopped vegetables, such as cucumber, dill, or green onions. Hot boiled potatoes, cold sour cream, and diced hard-boiled eggs are often served alongside to add color, texture, and thermal contrast.|$|E
25|$|A {{steep and}} rough slope descends north east {{from the summit}} of Green Gable, {{dropping}} through Mitchell Cove to the flat-topped and rather damp col of Blackmoor Pols (1,995ft). Beyond this the ground rises again to the steep sided dome of Base Brown. On the south eastern face are crags overlooking Styhead Gill with Seathwaite Fell across the valley. The north western flanks are equally steep, but descending only half the vertical distance into the hanging valley of Gillercomb. This is the gathering ground of <b>Sour</b> <b>Milk</b> Gill, which drops over a series of falls around the northern extremity of Base Brown. Here it joins Styhead Gill and Grains Gill to form the nascent River Derwent. Across Gillercomb is the main ridge continuing north around Ennerdale, Brandreth being the initial fell. The top of Base Brown narrows considerably {{to the north of}} the summit, a prow-like ridge descending toward the falls of <b>Sour</b> <b>Milk</b> Gill. There is a prominent hanging stone here, startlingly poised over the rim of the crags. Another feature is the Seathwaite Slabs, a set of slabs of rocks used for rock climbing practice by novices and conveniently located only minutes from Seathwaite.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of bleaching powder (calcium hypochlorite) by Scottish chemist Charles Tennant in about 1800, {{based on the}} discoveries of French chemist Claude Louis Berthollet, revolutionised the bleaching processes in the textile industry by dramatically reducing the time required (from months to days) for the traditional process then in use, which required repeated exposure to the sun in bleach fields after soaking the textiles with alkali or <b>sour</b> <b>milk.</b> Tennant's factory at St Rollox, North Glasgow, became the largest chemical plant in the world.|$|E

25|$|Base Brown {{is often}} {{passed on the}} way to Sty Head and Esk Hause, along the popular paths which start at Seathwaite. Base Brown is itself almost {{exclusively}} climbed from this hamlet, via the cascades of <b>Sour</b> <b>Milk</b> Gill. Once the foot of Gillercomb is reached a choice presents itself. Either the walker can continue up the gill to reach Blackmoor Pols and then make an easy traverse back to the summit, or a direct line can be taken up the north ridge. Base Brown can be used as the first step to climbing Green and Great Gable.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} routes can be {{followed}} from Buttermere. <b>Sour</b> <b>Milk</b> Gill leads almost direct {{from the village}} into Bleaberry Comb, from where The Saddle can be gained. Alternatively the path to Scale Force can be used at the start. Climbing beside the fall itself leads to the reverse slope of Lincomb Edge, or an earlier turn up Far Ruddy Beck gives access into Ling Comb. From Ennerdale, the only break in {{the trees on the}} northern side is followed by a path up Gillflinter Beck. This leads onward to the summit, the only access on the Ennerdale side of Buttermere Edge. Many walkers will combine Red Pike, High Stile and High Crag in a single outing from Buttermere or Gatesgarth.|$|E
25|$|Kronrod {{decided that}} {{his best work}} was to help others and most {{importantly}} the terminally ill. He spent his fortune developing milil from a <b>sour</b> <b>milk</b> extract for cancer patients, to fill a shortage of anabol, an expensive drug developed in small quantities by his acquaintance Bogdanov in Bulgaria. He was promised but never acquired an animal testing laboratory so he tested the medicine on himself. Kronrod had no medical degree but he was well-informed in medicine. Milil was a last resort for seriously ill patients and was administered by physicians in one case in a hospital ward A.A. Vishnevskiy reserved for treatments by Kronrod's method. Kronrod himself never gave the drug to patients and through physicians gave it away free. The drug was unapproved and a criminal case was brought against him. He regained his research records when a relative of the plaintiff required milil for treatment and the case was dismissed.|$|E
5000|$|Clabber {{is a type}} of <b>soured</b> <b>milk.</b> It is {{produced}} by allowing unpasteurized <b>milk</b> to turn <b>sour</b> (ferment) at a specific humidity and temperature. Over time, the milk thickens or curdles into a yogurt-like substance with a strong, sour flavor.|$|R
25|$|Dairy {{products}} play {{an important}} role in Lithuanian cuisine; curd cheese (similar to cottage cheese) may be sweet, sour, seasoned with caraway, fresh, or cured until semi-soft. The most popular way of eating Lithuanian non-fermented white cheese is with fresh honey; it can also be cooked with spices and enjoyed with tea. Lithuanian butters and cream are unusually rich. Sour cream is so prominent in Lithuanian cuisine, that it is eaten with everything - meat, fish, pancakes, soups, desserts, salads and so on. Lithuanian curd snacks called sūreliai are popular too. Also, a big variety of different <b>soured</b> <b>milk</b> products are available in the supermarkets, though many people still prefer making their own <b>soured</b> <b>milk.</b>|$|R
50|$|On weekdays, various cereals such as corn flakes, muesli or {{rolled oats}} are often served for breakfast with just cold <b>milk</b> and sugar. <b>Soured</b> <b>milk</b> {{products}} are popular, too, and are served either plain or with cereals or fruit. The typical local <b>soured</b> <b>milk</b> product of ymer is topped with ymerdrys, {{a mixture of}} dried grated rye bread and brown sugar. Porridges such as oatmeal and a traditional local porridge called Øllebrød are also popular on work days. Øllebrød, a thin porridge cooked with bits of rye bread, hvidtøl, water, and sugar, and served with milk or sometimes whipped cream, is gaining in popularity as reflected on the breakfast menus of many cafés.|$|R
