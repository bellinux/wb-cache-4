30|$|A key {{development}} in monitoring is <b>Smart</b> <b>Metering.</b> The UK expects {{to complete their}} <b>smart</b> <b>meter</b> roll out by 2020, which potentially provides half-hourly load readings for households.

Since then, Hydro-Québec organized a 2-year pilot project, involving 2,000 customers in 4 cities, with time of use metering. A report, filed with the Régie de l'énergie, in the summer of 2010 concluded that the effect of marginal cost pricing with three levels of pricing in the winter would lead to minimal load and energy savings. The company intends to gradually phase-in Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) between 2011 and 2017. Early efforts will focus on meter data transfer, connect-disconnect, outage detection and theft reduction.|$|E

40|$|A <b>smart</b> <b>meter</b> {{is crucial}} in the {{advanced}} metering infrastructure (AMI), which aims to assist the provider and customers working together to use electrical energy more efficiently. In recent years, many researchers have focused on providing stable interactive services between the provider and customers by integrating the information technology (IT) infrastructure and <b>smart</b> <b>meter</b> networks. A variety of data types such as control messages, electrical usage messages, and so forth can be transmitted between the provider and customers. Some of these messages, such as control messages, need low latency and high availability. <b>Smart</b> <b>meter</b> networks therefore need to provide Quality of Service (QoS) support that is able {{to satisfy the requirements}} of these messages.
