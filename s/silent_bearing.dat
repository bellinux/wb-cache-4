Notwithstanding his continual profession of the highest Christian principles he could never forget or forgive, and this although {{it was he who}} was in fault. For what wrong had Godfrey done to him in loving a woman whom he did not chance to like? So he died <b>silent,</b> <b>bearing</b> his resentment to the grave. And yet some odd sense of justice prevented him from robbing Godfrey of his little inheritance, something under two thousand pounds, that came on a policy of insurance and certain savings, a sum which in after years when money was plentiful with him Godfrey appointed to the repair and beautifying of the Abbey Church at Monk's Acre.|$|E
60|$|It is {{distinctive}} {{of almost}} all strikes, that the women, beforehand averse to the movement, when it has once begun, throw themselves heartily into the struggle. From the time it is fairly entered upon until its termination it is rare indeed to hear a collier's wife speak a word against it. When the hardest pinch comes, and the children's faces grow thin and white, and the rooms are stripped of furniture, much as the women may long for an end of it, they never grumble, never pray their husbands to give in. This patient submission to their husbands' wills--this <b>silent</b> <b>bearing</b> of the greatest of suffering, namely, to see children suffer and to be unable to relieve them--is {{one of the most}} marked features of all great strikes in the coal districts.|$|E
6000|$|They {{were the}} Emperor's words, {{and it was}} I, Etienne Gerard, who was {{to turn them into}} deeds. I burned to reach the Marshal, and for an instant I thought of riding through the English left wing, as being the {{shortest}} cut. I have done bolder deeds and come out safely, but I reflected that if things went badly with me and I was taken or shot the message would be lost and the plans of the Emperor miscarry. I passed in front of the cavalry, therefore, past the Chasseurs, the Lancers of the Guard, the Carabineers, the Horse Grenadiers, and, lastly, my own little rascals, who followed me wistfully with their eyes. Beyond the cavalry the Old Guard was standing, twelve regiments of them, all veterans of many battles, sombre and severe, in long blue overcoats and high bearskins from which the plumes had been removed. Each bore within the goatskin knapsack upon his back the blue and white parade uniform which they would use for their entry into Brussels next day. As I rode past them I reflected that these men had never been beaten, and as I looked at their weather-beaten faces and their stern and <b>silent</b> <b>bearing,</b> I said to myself that they never would be beaten. Great heavens, how little could I foresee what a few more hours would bring! ...|$|E

40|$|In {{cooperation}} with SKF, {{a research project}} was started on the dynamics of ball bearings. The research is motivated by the demand for <b>silent</b> <b>bearings</b> in noise sensitive applications, especially in the household appliance and automotive industry. The investigations should bring a clear understanding {{about the role of}} the bearing in the application with respect to the design, the quality and the way it is mounted. The dynamic behaviour of a ball bearing application is studied by means of predictive modelling. The application consists of a flexible shaft supported by two deep groove ball bearings mounted in flexible housings. The housings, the shaft and the bearing outer rings are modelled with the finite element method. To solve the equations of motion by means of time integration, the large finite element models are reduced with component mode synthesis (CMS). To account for the flexibility of the bearing outer ring a new CMS method has been developed (reference [1. ]). The stiffness and damping of the elastohydro-dynamically lubricated contacts between the balls and the guiding rings are modelled with spring-damper models. Their constitutive behaviour has been predicted with the help of transient contact calculations (reference [2. ]). The present work focuses on two sources of vibration. Due to the rotation of the lubricated contacts...|$|R
5000|$|Daughter of the Forest {{is based}} loosely on [...] "The Six Swans" [...] (a {{story that has}} many versions, {{one of which is}} recounted by Hans Christian Andersen). A 13-year-old girl, Sorcha, (pronounced Sor-ka or {{sometimes}} Ser-ha) must sew six shirts from a painful nettle plant in order to save her brothers from a witch's enchantment. They have been turned into swans and can only be returned to their true forms if she creates a shirt for each brother with her own hands - and she must remain completely mute until the task is finished. Living in hiding, Sorcha must avoid discovery, survive off the land, and toil night and day to complete her task without the benefit of any tools of the trade, using only what the forest around her can provide--all while keeping <b>silent</b> and <b>bearing</b> unfathomable loneliness. Terrible events hinder her progress and eventually take her further and further away from her home. As months and even years pass by, Sorcha's lonely existence is only brightened by her hope of breaking the spell on her brothers....and a foreign man nicknamed 'Red'.|$|R
6000|$|Archelaus grew so wicked, that in {{the year}} 12 A.D. an {{accusation}} against him was sent to Rome by the Jews and Samaritans; and Augustus deposed him, sending him into banishment to Vienne, in Gaul. His brothers did not obtain his domain, but it was joined to the province of Syria, and put under the charge of a Roman procurator or governor, who kept down disturbances by the strong hand; but this made the Pharisees very discontented, as they fancied it was against the Divine Law {{to pay tribute to}} strangers. Augustus had been all his life busy in setting his empire in order, and making laws for it. It stretched from the Atlantic Ocean nearly to the river Euphrates, and bordered the Mediterranean Sea on both sides, the Alps shutting it in to the north, and the deserts of Africa to the south. The Roman citizens considered themselves the lords of all this space; and though at first only the true-born Romans were citizens, Augustus gave the honour to many persons of the subject nations. It freed them from being taxed, gave them a right to vote for magistrates, and saved them from being under the authority of the governors of the provinces. Every educated person spoke Latin and Greek, but the latter tongue was most used in the east, as the Romans themselves learnt it as an accomplishment. Augustus died, A.D. 17, leaving his power to his step-son, Tiberius, whom he had adopted as his own son, and thus given him the name of Caesar. Tiberius had not been kindly treated in his youth, and he was gloomy and harsh, and exceedingly disliked by the Romans. Under him, Pontius Pilate was made Procurator of Judea, and took up his abode in Caesarea, a city built by Herod and him son Philip, on the coast, and named after the emperors. Pilate set up shields with idolatrous inscriptions in Jerusalem; but the Jews petitioned Tiberius, who ordered them to be removed, and there was much hatred between the Procurator and the Jews. The thirty years of <b>silent</b> <b>bearing</b> of the common lot of man were now nearly over; and six months ere the Messiah began to make Himself known, His messenger, John, the Desert Priest, began to prepare His way by preaching repentance in the spirit and power of the great Elijah, and then baptizing in the Jordan unto repentance. Such washing was {{the manner in which the}} Jews accepted their proselytes, as they called the strangers who embraced the Law. The great purpose of the Old Covenant was accomplished when John, having made his followers feel all the weight of their sins against the Commandments, pointed out Him whom he had already baptized, and said, [...] "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world!" [...] A few faithful Galileans followed and believed, and miracles began to testify that here was indeed the Christ, the Prophet like to Moses, giving bread to the hungry, eyes to the blind, feet to the lame. Decreasing as He increased, John offended Herod Antipas by [...] "boldly rebuking vice." [...] This Antipas had forsaken his own wife, the daughter of an Arabian king, and had taken in her stead, his niece Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip; and for bearing witness against this crime, John was thrown into prison, and afterwards beheaded, to gratify the wicked woman and her daughter, Salome. The Arab King avenged his daughter's wrongs by a war, in which Antipas met with a great defeat.|$|E
40|$|The {{demand for}} <b>silent</b> <b>bearing</b> {{applications}} {{has resulted in}} the development of an effective damping layer between the outer ring of a rolling bearing and the surrounding structure. By means of numerical modeling using both FEM and BEM techniques an induction motor for household appliances is analyzed. A hybrid modeling approach combining measured structural velocities with a BEM formulation is used to validate the acoustic model. The numerical results are compared with results obtained from sound intensity measurements estimating the radiated sound power level for a running electric mo tor. It is found that a relatively simple boundary element model is capable of predicting the radiated sound power in a wide frequency range. By using BEM in combination with the radiation modes formulation it is found that a properly designed viscoelastic layer {{in the vicinity of the}} bearing is theoretically capable of reducing a fair amount of sound emitted by the motor...|$|E
6000|$|One of Euphemia's {{brightest}} ideas was to burn wood. Logs {{make even}} a picturesque pile in a corner--look [...] "uncommon." [...] But there are objections to wood. Wood finely divided burns with gay quirks and jets of flame, and making cheerful crackling noises the while; but its warmth and brightness are as evanescent as love's young dream. And your solid log {{has a certain}} irritating inertness. It is an absentee fuel, spending its fire up the chimney, and after its youthful clouds of glory turns but a cheerless side {{of black and white}} char towards the room. And, above all, the marital mind is strangely exasperated by the log. Smite it with the poker, and you get but a sullen resonance, a flight of red sparks, a sense of an unconquerable toughness. It is worse than coke. The crisp fracture of coal, the spitting flames suddenly leaping into existence from the shiny new fissures, are altogether wanting. Old-seasoned timber burns indeed most delightfully, but then it is as ugly as coal, and withal very dear. So Euphemia went back to coal again with a sigh. Possibly if Euphemia had been surrounded by the wealth she deserves this trouble would not have arisen. A <b>silent</b> servant, <b>bearing</b> the due dose of fresh fuel, would have come gliding from a mysterious Beneath, restored the waning animation of the grate, and vanished noiselessly again. But this was beyond the range of Euphemia's possibilities. And so we are face to face with this problem of the scuttle again.|$|R
60|$|We alighted at {{the gate}} where Columbus, when a poor pedestrian, a {{stranger}} in the land, asked bread and water for his child! As long as the convent stands, {{this must be a}} spot calculated to awaken the most thrilling interest. The gate remains apparently in nearly the same state as {{at the time of his}} visit, but there is no longer a porter at hand to administer to the wants of the wayfarer. The door stood wide open, and admitted us into a small court-yard. Thence we passed through a Gothic portal into the chapel, without seeing a human being. We then traversed two interior cloisters, equally vacant and <b>silent,</b> and <b>bearing</b> a look of neglect and dilapidation. From an open window we had a peep at what had once been a garden, but that had also gone to ruin; the walls were broken and thrown down; a few shrubs, and a scattered fig tree or two, were all the traces of cultivation that remained. We passed through the long dormitories, but the cells were shut up and abandoned; we saw no living thing except a solitary cat stealing across a distant corridor, which fled in a panic at the unusual sight of strangers. At length, after patrolling nearly the whole of the empty building to the echo of our own footsteps, we came to where the door of a cell, being partly open, gave us the sight of a monk within, seated at a table writing. He rose, and received us with much civility, and conducted us to the superior, who was reading in an adjacent cell. They were both rather young men, and, together with a novitiate and a lay-brother, who officiated as cook, formed the whole community of the convent.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe flavivirus nonstructural {{glycoprotein}} NS 1 {{is highly}} conserved and contains two N-linked glycosylation sites which are both utilized for addition of oligosaccharides during replication in cell culture. NS 1 {{has been shown}} to contain epitopes for protective antibodies; however, its roles in virus replication and pathogenesis remain unknown. To study the function of NS 1 during yellow fever virus replication, six mutant viruses which lack either one or both glycosylation sites and another one containing silent mutations at both sites were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutants lacking the second glycosylation site and those <b>bearing</b> <b>silent</b> mutations were similar to the parental virus in their cell culture properties. Ablation of the first or both glycosylation sites generated mutants exhibiting small plaque phenotypes, decreased virus yields, reduced cytopathic effects, impaired NS 1 secretion, and depressed RNA accumulation. In addition, mutants lacking the first or both glycosylation sites exhibited significant reduction in mouse neurovirulence after intracerebral inoculation. These defects appear to result from the lack of N-linked glycans rather than the introduction of deleterious amino acid substitutions or disruption ofcis-acting RNA elements important for RNA replication. These results suggest an important role for NS 1 in flavivirus RNA replication and pathogenesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} <b>silent</b> rolling <b>bearing</b> applications, such as {{electric}} motors and gearboxes, {{has resulted in}} an investigation of viscoelastic bearing supports. By placing a thin viscoelastic layer between the bearing outer ring and the surrounding structure, vibrations of the shaft-bearing arrangement can be isolated and damped {{in such a way}} that the radiated sound power is reduced. The ultimate goal of this research was to develop a design strategy for viscoelastic bearing supports resulting in an effective noise reduction. This thesis describes the dynamic and acoustic behaviour of rolling bearing applications with viscoelastic bearing supports. Ultimately, the investigations cover a wide range of aspects in mechanical engineering: (1) the description of viscoelastic material behaviour; (2) development of a new Component Mode Synthesis method for viscoelastic components; (3) experimental investigations into the mechanical properties of viscoelastic materials; (4) development of advanced structural models of rotor dynamics applications; (5) numerical and experimental investigations of the dynamic and acoustic behaviour of an electric motor; (6) development of a design strategy for noise reduction by viscoelastic bearing supports In the present research, elastic components, like the shaft or the housing, and the viscoelastic support are modelled with the finite element method. In addition, the models are reduced by Component Mode Synthesis to save computation time. Viscoelasticity is described by a generalised Maxwell representation suitable for both time and frequency domain analyses. Viscoelastic materials are measured on a Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer to obtain the frequency dependent stiffness and damping characteristics. The viscoelastic modelling approach is succesfully validated at a component level with sandwich rings. The results showed that a significant amount of damping can be created by the viscoelastic layer. As a next step, numerical and experimental studies were performed on a rotor dynamics test rig. A clear vibration reduction was achieved with viscoelastic supports, especially for high running speeds. Subsequently, the dynamic and acoustic behaviour of a running electric motor was analysed. The acoustic analysis was based on the boundary element method using so-called radiation modes. The agreement between experimental and numerical results was satisfactory in the noisiest frequency range from 1000 to 2500 Hz. It was found that the sound power level of the electric motor can be reduced by 3 to 5 dB(A) with a viscoelastic bearing support. Finally, a strategy is proposed for designing noise reducing viscoelastic bearing supports. A set of qualitative design rules and a more quantitative design approach are presented...|$|R

40|$|The small GTPases of the Rho {{family are}} key {{intermediates}} in cellular signalling triggered by activated cell-adhesion receptors. In this study, we {{took advantage of}} RNA interference (RNAi) using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to define {{the roles of the}} best-characterized members of the RhoGTPase family, RhoA, Rac 1 and Cdc 42, in the control of MMP- 1, MMP- 2 and type-I-collagen expression in normal human skin fibroblasts (HSFs). A specific and long-lasting repression, up to 7 days after transfection, of the three GTPases was achieved by transient transfection of specific siRNA. The silencing of Cdc 42, but not that of RhoA or Rac 1, induced a 15 -fold increase in MMP- 1 secretion. This upregulation was confirmed at the mRNA level and observed with two different siRNAs targeting Cdc 42. Such a regulation was also observed in various human cell lines and was rescued by re-expressing wild-type Cdc 42 encoded by a construct <b>bearing</b> <b>silent</b> mutations impeding its recognition by the siRNA. By contrast, MMP- 2 and type-I-collagen expression was not affected by the individual silencing of each Rho GTPase. Cytokine protein array, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and reverse-transcription PCR measurements revealed that ablation of Cdc 42 induced an overexpression of interleukin 8 and MCP- 1. Although these cytokines are known to induce the expression of MMP- 1, we showed that they were not involved in the Cdc 42 -mediated upregulation of MMP- 1. Silencing of Cdc 42 also induced an increased phosphorylation of ERK 1 / 2 and p 38 MAP kinase. The use of chemical inhibitors on Cdc 42 -ablated cells revealed that the upregulation of MMP- 1 is dependent on the ERK 1 / 2 pathways, whereas the p 38 MAP kinase pathway displayed an inhibitory role. Simultaneous knock-down of two or three Rho GTPases allowed us to demonstrate that the RhoA-ROCK pathway was not involved in this regulation but that the silencing of Rac 1 reduced the effect of Cdc 42 suppression. These data suggest that, in vivo, when cell/extracellular-matrix interactions via integrins induce cytoskeleton organization, MMP- 1 expression is maintained at a low level by Cdc 42 via a repression of the Rac 1 and ERK 1 / 2 pathways. Therefore, Cdc 42 contributes to ECM homeostasis and connective tissue integrity. Peer reviewe...|$|R
