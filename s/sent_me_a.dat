25|$|The {{desirability}} of hiring directors over 60 is fairly diminished in this marketplace. At the same time, I hadn't had a good-sized hit {{in quite a}} while. And, frankly, I went {{through a couple of}} experiences that left me pretty disgusted with it all, and I was thinking the time had passed. I was just sitting at home reading magazines and looking out the window — a couple of projects I had had just fallen apart — when I got a call from Sly, who had <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> script.|$|E
500|$|Gillan {{was largely}} {{dissatisfied}} with his brief stint in Sabbath, notably the final mix of Born Again (though {{he liked the}} songs and their original mixes), and its cover, which featured a demonic-looking baby. He was quoted in Kerrang! in 1984 as saying, [...] "I looked at the cover and puked." [...] In an interview supporting Deep Purple's reformation in 1984, he stated of Born Again, [...] "They had <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> box of records. And, when I saw the cover, and heard the mix, I smashed {{every single one of}} them to pieces." ...|$|E

500|$|Robert Smith's {{personal}} favourite is {{the cover}} recorded by American alternative rock band Dinosaur Jr., which was released {{as a single}} in the UK in 1989 (and 1990 in the US). Dinosaur Jr.'s version has a faster tempo and showcases the band's loud and distortion-heavy sound. The band's frontman J Mascis explained, [...] "We recorded it for a compilation album, but when we finished it we {{liked it so much}} we didn't want to give it to them." [...] Smith said, [...] "J Mascis <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> cassette, and it was so passionate. It was fantastic. I've never had such a visceral reaction to a cover version before or since", and even said the cover has [...] "influenced how we play it live".|$|E
500|$|Bakshi {{is quoted}} as saying that he had [...] "mixed feeling" [...] about Jackson's adaptations, {{although}} he had not seen the films. [...] "In some respects I feel good that Peter Jackson continued and went on, and in some respects I feel bad that Saul Zaentz, the producer, and various people never called me, thanked me, or asked my permission to do the movie. [...] has anyone <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> bottle of wine, on the tremendous success. [...] But I have more feelings on the business side of that than I do on the creative side. I'm glad Peter Jackson had a movie to look at—I never did. And certainly there's a lot to learn from watching any movie, both its mistakes and when it works. So he had a little easier time than I did, and a lot better budget." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Guy Love" [...] was {{composed}} by Fordham and Perry. It was a late {{addition to the}} episode, brought on because, according to Bill Lawrence, [...] "All the modern musicals like Jekyll & Hyde have these really overwrought love songs, so {{we really wanted to}} have one between J.D. and Turk." [...] It was the hardest song for Fordham to write. She met with Perry for help with the lyrics, and he gave her the hook, [...] "It's guy love, between two guys." [...] The writing became easier, but she still wanted a reference to a tender moment between Turk and J.D. She emailed D'Abruzzo, who she knew to be a big fan of the show, [...] "and, no exaggeration, five minutes later, she <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> list of 30 [...] ", [...] including Turk performing an appendectomy on J.D. in [...] "My Day Off". [...] At first, the song {{was meant to be a}} power ballad.|$|E

500|$|When {{asked about}} the casting process, Van Ark explained: [...] "It all {{happened}} so fast. They <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> script for a [...] two-part guest shot, but I {{was supposed to be}} in New York recording commercials. My husband - much like Larry Hagman's wife, Maj, talked him into playing J.R. - basically talked me into playing Val." [...] She later added, [...] "I thought the script was wonderful, and [...] was a great character. But we created her within those two episodes. I remember going to wardrobe and getting a peachy pink waitress uniform, and the shoes. And then I was trying to get that Texas sound, her all important accent. And so we created her layer by layer." [...] During the second season of Dallas, David Jacobs decided to create a spin-off for the quickly growing franchise. He wanted to create a television show based on [...] "family issues and examining relationships at the middle class level". The production company, CBS, turned down this idea, as they wanted something more [...] "glitzy" [...] to put on the air, with wealthier characters, which would become Dallas.|$|E
500|$|On December 17, 2013, LaBeouf {{released}} his short film Howard Cantour.com to the Internet; shortly thereafter, several bloggers noted its close similarity to Justin M. Damiano, a 2007 comic by Ghost World creator Dan Clowes. Wired journalist Graeme McMillan noted {{at least three}} similarities in their article, {{one of which was}} that the opening monologue for the short and the comic were identical. LaBeouf would later remove the film and claim that he did not intend to copy Clowes but was instead [...] "inspired" [...] by him and [...] "got lost in the creative process." [...] He followed this up with several apologies via Twitter writing, [...] "In my excitement and naiveté as an amateur filmmaker, I got lost in the creative process and neglected to follow proper accreditation", and [...] "I deeply regret the manner in which these events have unfolded and want @danielclowes to know that I have a great respect for his work". Clowes responded by saying [...] "The first I ever heard of the film was this morning when someone <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> link. I've never spoken to or met Mr. LaBeouf ... I actually can't imagine what was going through his mind." [...] LaBeouf was criticized over his apology, with some sites such as The A.V. Club noting that the apology itself appeared to have been lifted from a 2010 post on Yahoo! Answers.|$|E

[...] In an interview with DJ Semtex for BBC Radio, Minaj explained how the concept for her rap verse developed, revealing [...] "I just wanted to be crazy, I wrote that track in bed actually. I had an off day, they <b>sent</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> record and said they needed it back in 24 hours and I wrote." [...] With regard to the original, [...] "It's Raining Men", Minaj stated that she wanted to make [...] "Raining Men" [...] "more melodic and crazy."
