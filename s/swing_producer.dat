50|$|By {{modeling}} the <b>swing</b> <b>producer</b> behavior, John Morecroft describes two modes: normal swing mode and punitive mode. Usually {{in the normal}} mode, the <b>swing</b> <b>producer</b> responds to market price fluctuations by increasing or decreasing its output {{in order to maintain}} stable prices for all producers. However, independent participants can take unjust advantage of the reduced supply and increase their output in order to win a larger market share. In such cases, the <b>swing</b> <b>producer</b> switches to the punitive mode and greatly increases its product output in order to reduce prices, causing losses for other producers and making them cooperate.|$|E

In brief, I maintain that the first price jump (of 1973 - 1974), from about $ 3 to $ 12 per barrel, represents the "correct" adjustment {{from the point of}} view of the "core" producing countries (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arabs Emirates), whose objective it should be to maximize profits over time.

40|$|Although {{conventional}} wisdom suggests that OPEC is a cartel, many studies since 1973 {{have focused on}} other underlying forces to explain and forecast OPEC behaviour. Economic theory suggests that natural resource producers should dynamically optimize, {{and a variety of}} studies have relied on dynamic optimization. Hence, we build a model consistent with dynamic optimization and jointly test dynamic optimization with other hypotheses prevalent in the literature. We use econometric analysis of quarterly data from 1971 :l to 1986 : 4. We find that individual OPEC countries behave in quite dissimilar ways, suggesting that a cartel hypothesis is not appropriate. Under our specification, {{there was no evidence of}} dynamic optimization or a strong target revenue model. Some evidence indicated that Iran, Libya, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) may include a form of target revenue in their goals. Iraqi behaviour was most consistent with a static competitive market structure. While a static non-competitive market structure was not rejected for Algeria, capacity constraints are more likely to have dictated Algerian policy. A static non-competitive market structure was not rejected for Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Venezuela. Given the divergent behaviour of OPEC countries, we conclude that OPEC, rather than being a weak cartel, consists of a non-competitive core of <b>swing</b> <b>producers,</b> each <b>swinging</b> to its own rhythm...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about {{competitive}} {{strength in the}} global markets for iron ore. Its {{focus is on the}} Swedish iron ore producer, LKAB, and its role in this global market. The finding of new vast deposits of iron ore in Brazil and Australia, together with falling transportation costs, meant that LKAB started to meet fierce competition in the 1970 s. The company went into a deep crisis in the late 1970 s and early 1980 s, but has, in spite of underground mining above the Arctic Circle, survived and is now, in 1996, operating at a profit. The paper shows that a number of factors made this possible. Government grants provided to the company in the early 1980 s made it possible for LKAB to reduce its operation, from a capacity around 30 million tons to 15 million tons, to better meet the market’s requirements. Introduction of higher sub-level caving and new, higher capacity machinery, increased the company’s productivity by almost 100 % during the 1980 s. The most important factor behind the company’s survival and sustained competitiveness is, however, its product development. The former core of LKAB, the high- phosphorus fines, is now replaced by the olivine pellet, developed in early 1980 s. It is shown that an important precondition for LKAB’s development of the pellets, is its unique deposit of high grade magnetite ore. LKAB’s mining cost is shown to be relatively high, but the high grade magnetite ore means that LKAB has one of the lowest pelletizing costs in the world, which gives LKAB a favorable position on the supply curve for pellets. One of LKAB competitive advantages is therefore its rich deposit of high grade magnetite, which gives the company a special advantage in the market for pellets. The analysis in the paper also shows that the market for pellets is more price- and business cycle sensitive compared to the market for fines. These sensitivities in the pellet market, have, however, decreased over time and is now only marginally different from the market for fines, at least from a global, world market, point of view. The market for pellets, now LKAB’s major market, has therefore become more mature and pellets have become a more accepted product, used on a regular basis, and not just a product used during peaks. LKAB is shown to have a strong position in both the European pellets market and the markets for Direct Reduction-pellets (DR-pellets) in Asia and the Middle East. It is primarily Brazil and Canada that are the <b>swing</b> <b>producers</b> in Europe, LKAB is more stable, only marginally affected by business cycle swings and price changes. LKAB and companies in Brazil have a very strong position in the market for DR-pellets in Asia and the Middle East, they are basically the sole suppliers to these markets. The potentials for growth for LKAB is within the distant market for DR- pellets, a market i which it already has a strong position. The number of Electric Arc Furnaces using DRI as their primary feed is expected to grow in Asia and the Middle East opening the possibilities for this growth. The major obstacles for this growth are the opening of new DR-pellet plants in Brazil, Venezuela, and India, and of course LKAB’s own capacity limitation. Godkänd; 1997; 20061128 (haneit...|$|R

50|$|The {{term was}} defined on May 8, 2015 by Olivier Jakob, the {{director}} of Petromatrix, a Swiss-based consultancy company that publishes a daily note on the oil markets. Petromatrix described the shale band as a price range between $45 and $65 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil. Below $45 per barrel, production of US shale oil would fall sharply, and above $65 production would surge. According to Olivier Jakob, {{the price of crude}} oil would therefore remain within that range as long as the US remained the <b>swing</b> <b>producer</b> of crude oil in an environment where OPEC is producing at capacity. The concept of the shale band was subsequently verified in the market action of 2015 and the Wall Street Journal characterized the shale band as one of the key terms and phrases from 2015. The term is now widely used in by the financial press and market analysts to describe the price action of oil during over the year of 2015 and 2016.|$|E
5000|$|OPEC's {{membership}} {{began to}} have divided opinions over what actions to take.

In 1985, daily output was around 3.5 million bpd, down from around 10 million in 1981. During this period, OPEC members were supposed to meet production quotas in order to maintain price stability; however, many countries inflated their reserves to achieve higher quotas, cheated, or outright refused to accord with the quotas. In 1985, the Saudis tired of this behavior and decided to punish the undisciplined OPEC countries. The Saudis abandoned their role as <b>swing</b> <b>producer</b> and began producing at full capacity, creating a [...] "huge surplus that angered many of their colleagues in OPEC". [...] High-cost oil production facilities became less or even not profitable. Oil prices as a result fell to as low as $7 per barrel.|$|E

In addition to uncertainty about the evolution of demand, a firm faces strategic uncertainty concerning the decisions of its rivals. We numerically solve the model for its Markov-perfect equilibria. For one set of parameter values, three equilibria exist, and while all of them have simple, intuitive structures, they exhibit widely varying patterns of response to demand shocks. At one extreme, one firm dominates the industry almost as a monopolist and changes its capacity to accommodate demand. At the other extreme, the larger firm keeps its capacity nearly constant while the smaller firm acts as the <b>swing</b> <b>producer.</b> Capacity investment and disinvestment Demand uncertainty Strategic uncertainty Dynamic stochastic games Markov-perfect equilibrium...|$|E
40|$|We examine {{government}} cartelization {{efforts in}} crude oil production. Texas and Saudi Arabia are alleged {{to act as}} swing producers to maintain the interstate (1933 - 1972) and OPEC (1973 on) oil cartels respectively. We analyze the political constraints that affected the ability of Texas and Saudi Arabia to act as residual producers within their respective cartels. In the case of Texas, political factors molded individual firm production quotas, advantaging high-cost producers and hence, reducing total cartel net profits. Further, Texas had limited range for adjusting total state production to maintain interstate output at levels consistent with target prices. Saudi Arabia’s role as <b>swing</b> <b>producer</b> within OPEC raises similar questions regarding how cartel output is shared among members, {{and the extent to}} which domestic economic and political pressures coming from various member countries may undermine the effectiveness of the cartel.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} idea in system dynamics is that interdependencies {{in business and}} society significantly influence the performance over time of firms and industries. This idea is often summarised in the phrase ‘feedback structure gives rise to dynamic behaviour’. But what if the time horizon of a modelling study spans decades, {{as is often the}} case in models of natural resource management? Is it possible to find enduring feedback structures that shape events over such long periods? An example is presented based on a well-known system dynamics model of the upstream oil industry. The model was originally developed in the late 1980 s and subsequently updated. The model’s structure is reviewed against the backdrop of recent expansion in U. S. shale oil production. Shale oil is undoubtedly a major technology breakthrough in oil recovery. However this change pales in significance, when seen against the backdrop of strong and enduring feedback processes that coordinate OPEC production. Simulations show that OPEC retains the power to control oil price, dominate global production and drive commercial producers (including frackers) out of the industry. Further simulations test the so-called ‘Saudi America’ hypothesis and reveal that US frackers could not plausibly displace Saudi Arabia as the oil industry’s <b>swing</b> <b>producer...</b>|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies of}} OPEC have {{suggested}} ways of explaining the behaviour of OPEC as a group. The specific role of Saudi Arabia {{in the market}} and within OPEC has received attention from some authors. This study analyses the role of Saudi Arabia in these models and tries to find how much they explain the role of Saudi Arabia in the period from 1973 to the present. Models of OPEC behaviour are divided into four sets. The first set of models does not address the role of Saudi Arabia; they include monolithic cartel models and competitive models. The second set examines the role of Saudi Arabia in the oil markets; they include the different group models and the <b>swing</b> <b>producer</b> model. Then we discuss other theories of OPEC behaviour that may apply to Saudi Arabia, namely the target capacity utilisation model, the fiscal constraint model and the property right model. This is followed by a political interpretation of Saudi Arabia’s behaviour in the world oil market. Since Saudi Arabia is a major producer of oil it is likely to use its production and pricing policies to achieve certain objectives. These objectives are discussed in the light of each model and compared with expected oil policy. ...|$|E
40|$|Only a {{few years}} ago, as the world’s supply of oil was showing evidences of peaking, it was almost certain {{that the world was}} slowly running out of its main source of energy. It was certain that the world needed to prepare for a peak oil situation, and prices were {{breaking}} records again and again. From this situation emerged a new player in the oil industry that has changed the oil market for the next decades: the US tight oil, also known as shale oil, industry. This revolution was made possible by the high prices of the years 2008 - 2014 as well as a favorable environment: low interest rates allowed the shale companies to finance themselves for cheap, mineral rights are guaranteed by law, and the country’s need for energy independence gave political support to this industry. From only a few thousand barrels per day in the beginning of this century, the tight oil industry grew swiftly, and produces today about 4. 25 million barrels per day, which is more than Iran, the fifth biggest producing country in the world. Obviously, this new player shook up the oil industry, and reshuffled the cards in the oil market. OPEC, and particularly Saudi Arabia, the biggest crude oil producer in the world, which has been able to influence global price of oil, is losing slightly its market power. This research focus itself on the status of the <b>swing</b> <b>producer,</b> the producer that has this capacity of balancing the market of oil, preventing shortages or gluts. This “role” that has been held by Saudi Arabia since the 70 ’s, is now appearing to shift to the American shale producers. This study will present the actual state of the shale industry, to get {{a better understanding of the}} dynamics involved in this particular player in the oil market. Then, it will assess the characteristics of the <b>swing</b> <b>producer</b> and the characteristics of the previous swings. Finally, this research study the implications of this new situation on the oil market. New varieties of crudes are available on the market, and the trade flows of both crude and refined oil products are changing. By gathering and analyzing data and reports from the industry, specifically major factors such as prices, inventories, forward curves and trade flows, this study has come to the following conclusion: •	The shale industry, while having different characteristics compared to the previous swing producers, is the new price maker of the oil market. •	The emergence of this new player changed the rules in the oil game and forced conventional producers such as OPEC to adapt •	The market is entering a cycle of low prices that could last for year...|$|E
40|$|The global “great {{recession}} ” was precipitated {{in part by}} {{record high}} prices of oil and other commodities. Previous severe recessions have typically resulted in significantly lower energy prices, which in turn spurred growth and fueled a healthy recovery. In part due to expansionary monetary policies worldwide, oil prices have remained relatively high, {{making it difficult for}} the global economy to stage a strong recovery. The result is a short-to-medium term forecast of weak to modest growth, which – combined with continuously falling energy-intensity of GDP – means that oil demand will remain stagnant or at best grow modestly. Under these circumstances, surging supply from U. S. shale and similar technologically-driven unconventional oil sources is likely to create excess supply and put strong downward pressure on oil prices. Voluntary reduc-tion in oil production to prevent falling prices is highly unlikely, because <b>swing</b> <b>producer</b> Saudi Arabia and other GCC countries need revenues at the level of current volumes and prices in order to meet core budgetary requirements and prevent regime-change risk in the aftermath of “Arab Spring ” revolts. Our wavelet analysis of all countries that have ever produced more than one mil-lion barrels of oil per day shows that regime change by itself would not result in significant reduction in oil production – although it may result in lower investment and therefore prevention of further increase in production capac-ity. However, war that destroys physical installations for the production and/or transport of oil can significantly disrupt oil supplies. In sum, if the outright war scenario is excluded, we expect prices to fall precipitously in the medium term (3 - 5 years). However, the continued threat of currently-contained civil wars into larger confrontations can maintain the current prices, especially if unprecedented monetary easing continues. 1...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{identifies}} {{the relationship between}} economic factors and non-economic factors, and the relative weight of each, {{in the conduct of}} Middle East foreign policies but with special reference to Saudi Arabia and Iran between 2001 and 2012. In the Saudi case, economic factors are contextualized within its traditional themes of maintaining security and stability through international alliances and promoting stable and long term energy export markets. In the case of Iran, economic factors such as the role of sanctions in facilitating closer ties with a range of anti-western states are put into perspective by other factors such as national security issues and emerging splits in the decision making elite. The research draws on a conceptual hybrid of constructivism and omni-balancing and by doing so pays particular attention to the perceptions of foreign policy decision makers in their assessments of the domestic, regional and international environments. The conceptual framework therefore accounts for historical events such as the Islamic revolution and perceived hostility to it, and enduring Saudi-Iranian tensions based on sectarian and ideological struggles for dominance across the Middle East. Oil policy, including oil production, pricing and security of supply and demand, is found to be the paramount economic factor in the foreign policies of Saudi Arabia and Iran, but weighted in favour of the former. As <b>swing</b> <b>producer</b> in OPEC, Saudi Arabia needs to maintain sustainable oil supplies to its allies in the West, and increasingly East, whilst leveraging its oil reserves against adversaries such as Iran. In contrast, Iran has the incentive, but a dwindling capability, to maximise its oil revenues to fund the national budget amid tightening U. S. -led sanctions designed to curb its nuclear programme. The thesis also finds that economic factors such as ‘riyal politik’ as well as non-oil trade and investment deals are less effective in Saudi and Iranian foreign policy. This is because they tend to be offered or utilised as short-term leveraging mechanisms in new or unstable bilateral relationships with a variety of state or nonstate actors which do not always share their ideological perspective or interests. To overcome significant geo-strategic and ideological incompatibilities, reciprocal confidence building measures and active engagement on a broad set of contentious issues is prescribed.

40|$|Since 2014, {{the world}} have {{experienced}} a different {{world in terms of}} oil prices. There has been an oversupply in the market as well as lower demand growth than expected. Especially the rise of shale in the US took analysts and experts by surprise and the extra supply from shale was not calculated in forecasts. As prices plummeted, the world looked to OPEC, which had traditionally taken on the role of being a <b>swing</b> <b>producer.</b> When OPEC had their meeting in November of 2014, the market expected them to cut in production to stabilize the market. Instead, OPEC decided to stay with the same levels and we saw a further decrease in oil prices. OPEC have been characterized as a cartel in the literature, but through using Alhajii & Huettner`s (2000 a) six characteristics of a successful cartel, it seems evident that shale has had its impact on OPECs market power in the global oil market and that the cartel is not as efficient and successful as it might have been in the past. While some of the characteristics of a successful cartel seems to have been missing from the establishment of the organization, others are fulfilled. Some of the characteristics, which make a cartel, has not been impacted by the rise of shale, other have clearly set its mark and have affected OPECs ability to respond and stabilize the market. One direct result of the rise of shale has been changes in OPECs export as well as their percentage of total world consumption. One of the most important channels OPEC has had in utilizing their market power has been through their spare production levels, which are now at low levels. As a response to lower oil prices, OPEC has in the past cut production levels, to a point where supply meets demand. This has had some success in the past as non-OPEC producers have traditionally had higher cost levels than OPEC and could not compete at low oil prices. This has changed with the shale revolution. Break-even prices of some shale fields range all the way down at $ 40, meaning that oil prices above this, they can still make money. As of June 2017, OPEC {{has not been able to}} raise the prices significantly and has made a plea to the US to join the production cuts, as it seems they are not able to do so themselves. In my opinion however, it seems as though OPEC is still an important player in the market, but that they have lost some of their market power due to shale. As we saw prices respond shortly after their announcements, it seems that OPEC have power and influence in the short run, but that in the long run, it is difficult to influence more heavy and long run price shocks as there are many other factors influencing the market...|$|E
