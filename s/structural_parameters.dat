40|$|Abstract: We {{consider}} a GMM framework where weaker patterns of identification may arise: typically, the data generating process {{is allowed to}} depend on the sample size. We are interested in providing inference about the identification of the <b>structural</b> <b>parameter.</b> First, for a given set of moment conditions, we propose a J-type test of the null that the <b>structural</b> <b>parameter</b> is not strongly identified. In other words, it is only as long as that the null cannot be rejected that it remains necessary to resort to alternative (nearly) weak identification asymptotics. Second, we propose a consistent Hausman-type test to test whether additional moment conditions enhance its identification. Failing to reject the null means that the candidate additional moment restrictions are useless to improve the strength of identification of the <b>structural</b> <b>parameter.</b> Finally, we propose a consistent test to test whether additional moment conditions are valid.

We study {{the flow of}} such fluids between two concentric cylinders using a phenomenological structural kinetics model. The structural kinetics approach balances the simplicity of phenomenological continuum approaches with a simplified model for structure against the complexity a more fundamental model based on particle micromechanics. A modified version of Houska's model, which includes a diffusive term for the <b>structural</b> <b>parameter,</b> is considered. Depending on the breakdown rate of the <b>structural</b> <b>parameter,</b> shear-banding may be observed. For shear-banding in steady flows, the stress selection depends on the diffusion of the <b>structural</b> <b>parameter.</b> If there is no structural diffusion, the displacement of the interface between the flowing and the static regions fixes the stress at the interface during the transient flow. In the cases of very small diffusive coefficients, the stress at the fluid / solid interface converges to a limit value which {{is different from the}} yield stress of the structured material as expected without any diffusion. Nevertheless, the inner torque and the flow profile are quite similar in both cases and the differences are localized near the fluid / solid interface. For shear-banding, the gradients of the <b>structural</b> <b>parameter</b> and the strain rate are very abrupt but the continuity is preserved by the diffusion...|$|R
40|$|Herein, {{we report}} on changes in the {{performance}} of a commercial cellulose triacetate (CTA) membrane, imparted by varied operating conditions and solution chemistries. Changes to feed and draw solution flow rate did not significantly alter the CTA membrane's water permeability, salt permeability, or membrane <b>structural</b> <b>parameter</b> when operated with the membrane skin layer facing the draw solution (PRO-mode). However, water and salt permeability increased with increasing feed or draw solution temperature, while the membrane <b>structural</b> <b>parameter</b> decreased with increasing draw solution, possibly due to changes in polymer intermolecular interactions. High ionic strength draw solutions may de-swell the CTA membrane via charge neutralization, which resulted in lower water permeability, higher salt permeability, and lower <b>structural</b> <b>parameter.</b> This observed trend was further exacerbated by the presence of divalent cations which tends to swell the polymer to a greater extent. Finally, the calculated CTA membrane's <b>structural</b> <b>parameter</b> was lower and less sensitive to external factors when operated in PRO-mode, but highly sensitive to the same factors when the skin layer faced the feed solution (FO-mode), presumably due to swelling/de-swelling of the saturated porous substructure by the draw solution. This is a first attempt aimed at systematically evaluating the changes in performance of the CTA membrane due to operating conditions and solution chemistry, shedding new insight into the possible advantages and disadvantages of this material in certain applications. © 2011 Elsevier B.

The phase diagrams in coordinates temperature - film thickness were calculated for different epitaxial misfit strains. Tensile misfit strains stimulate appearance of the spontaneous out-of-plane <b>structural</b> order <b>parameter</b> (displacement vector of an appropriate oxygen atom from its cubic position) in the structural phase. Compressive misfit strains stimulate appearance of the spontaneous in-plane <b>structural</b> order <b>parameter.</b> Gradients of the <b>structural</b> order <b>parameter</b> components, which inevitably exist {{in the vicinity of}} film surfaces due to the termination and symmetry breaking, induce improper polarization and pyroelectric response via the flexoelectric and rotostriction coupling mechanism. Flexoelectric and rotostriction coupling results in the roto-flexoelectric field that is antisymmetric inside the film, small in {{the central part of the}} film, where the gradients of the <b>structural</b> <b>parameter</b> are small, and maximal near the surfaces, where the gradients of the <b>structural</b> <b>parameter</b> are highest.

An improper pyroelectric response of thin films is high enough to be registered with planar-type electrode configurations by conventional pyroelectric methods.
