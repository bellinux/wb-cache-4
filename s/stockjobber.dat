They are not so false as the theory, because nothing can in falsity quite equal that. 'NOTRE MAISON,' this Pamphleteer may learn, if he please to make study and inquiry before speaking, did not rise by worship of Beelzebub at all in this world; but by a quite {{opposite}} line of conduct. It rose, in fact, by the course which all, except fools, <b>stockjobber</b> stags, cheating gamblers, forging Pamphleteers and other temporary creatures of the damned sort, have found from of old to be the one way of permanently rising: by steady service, namely, of the Opposite of Beelzebub. By conforming to the Laws of this Universe; instead of trying by pettifogging to evade and profitably contradict them. The Hohenzollerns too have a History still articulate to the human mind, if you search sufficiently; and this is what, even with some emphasis, it will teach us concerning their adventures, and achievements of success in the field of life. Resist the Devil, good reader, and he will flee from you!"--So ends our indignant friend.|$|E

60|$|As Lancelot {{walked up}} to the Priory that morning, the Reverend Panurgus O'Blareaway dashed out of a cottage by the roadside, and seized him unceremoniously by the shoulders. He was a {{specimen}} of humanity which Lancelot could not help at once liking and despising; a quaint mixture of conceit and earnestness, uniting the shrewdness of a <b>stockjobber</b> with the frolic of a schoolboy broke loose. He was rector of a place in the west of Ireland, containing some ten Protestants and some thousand Papists. Being, unfortunately for himself, a red-hot Orangeman, he had thought fit to quarrel with the priest, in consequence of which he found himself deprived both of tithes and congregation; and after receiving three or four Rockite letters, and a charge of slugs through his hat (of which he always talked as if being shot at was the most pleasant and amusing feature of Irish life), he repaired to England, and there, after trying to set up as popular preacher in London, declaiming at Exeter Hall, and writing for all the third-rate magazines, found himself incumbent of Lower Whitford. He worked there, as he said himself, 'like a horse;' spent his mornings in the schools, his afternoons in the cottages; preached four or five extempore sermons every week to overflowing congregations; took the lead, by virtue of the 'gift of the gab,' at all 'religious' meetings for ten miles round; and really did a great deal of good in his way. He had an unblushing candour about his own worldly ambition, with a tremendous brogue; and prided himself on exaggerating deliberately both of these excellences.|$|E

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that {{a network of}} active <b>stockjobbers</b> existed in London’s Exchange Alley before the South Sea Bubble and that the network operated effectively during the bubble to intermediate exchanges among {{a wide variety of}} customers. Moreover, the existence of a new financial asset {{after the collapse of the}} bubble, the 5 % perpetual annuities issued by the government to the South Sea’s stockholders in 1723, allowed the resumption of profitable market-making activity by a new group of stock jobbers specializing in the new asset. We argue that the resiliency of the existing network of <b>stockjobbers</b> to the shock of the bubble and its collapse laid the basis for an effective microstructure in the London capital market, and therefore to the continued rise of a secondary market for the British national debt. Dickson’s classic study on the financial revolution in Britain (Dickson, 1967) has spawned a large and growing literature on the sources of that revolution, its development over time, and its ultimate effects on the British economy. Dickson focused on the increasing use of funded long-term debt that could be credibly backed by Parliament, a perpetual and self-renewing institution, and dated its start with the implementation of Dutch financial techniques under William III after the Glorious Revolution (or the Dutch coup d’état according to recidivist Jacobites). Not until 1750 and the completion of plans to consolidate the government’s accumulated long-term debt into the Three Per Cent Consols, however, did Dickson consider the revolution to be complete and its effects on public finance irreversible. Other elements that contributed to Britain’s success in public finance have been studied since. D. W. Jones (Jones, 1988) showed how the short-term financing of immediate war needs was developed over the course of William III’s firs...|$|R

6000|$|To {{a knot of}} such learned pilferers our poet {{certainly}} belonged; and {{by turning}} over a few more of M. Longnon's negatives, we shall get {{a clear idea of}} their character and doings. Montigny and De Cayeux are names already known; Guy Tabary, Petit-Jehan, Dom Nicolas, little Thibault, who was both clerk and goldsmith, and who made picklocks and melted plate for himself and his companions - with these the reader has still to become acquainted. Petit-Jehan and De Cayeux were handy fellows and enjoyed a useful pre-eminence in honour of their doings with the picklock. [...] "DICTUS DES CAHYEUS EST FORTIS OPERATOR CROCHETORUM," [...] says Tabary's interrogation, [...] "SED DICTUS PETIT-JEHAN, EJUS SOCIUS, EST FORCIUS OPERATOR." [...] But the flower of the flock was little Thibault; it was reported that no lock could stand before him; he had a persuasive hand; let us salute capacity wherever we may find it. Perhaps the term GANG is not quite properly applied to the persons whose fortunes we are now about to follow; rather they were independent malefactors, socially intimate, and occasionally joining together for some serious operation just as modern <b>stockjobbers</b> form a syndicate for an important loan. Nor were they at all particular to any branch of misdoing. They did not scrupulously confine themselves to a single sort of theft, as I hear is common among modern thieves. They were ready for anything, from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter. Montigny, for instance, had neglected neither of these extremes, and we find him accused of cheating at games of hazard on the one hand, and on the other of the murder of one Thevenin Pensete in a house by the Cemetery of St. John. If time had only spared us some particulars, might not this last have furnished us with the matter of a grisly winter's tale? ...|$|R

The partners had a butler who served theirs in the boardroom. We had to get our own from the buffet table and eat it at the long table.Only partners were allowed to smoke cigars or drink spirits in the morning meeting (cigarettes were OK). Everyone smoked. Ashtrays were built into the desks. Everybody drank. Beaujolais Nouveau cost the industry a day of productivity a year, if not two. On my first day I drank five pints at lunchtime.

Share prices were displayed on one massive TV screen (28-inch) that sat next to the senior partners desk. An active stock price would change maybe five times a day. Most didnt change. A four-point move on the FT All Share FTSE All-Share Index was a volatile day. Prices were updated by stock exchange orange buttons who, if they could be bothered, would walk around the stock exchange floor and ask jobbers if anything had changed. The jobbers <b>Stockjobber</b> would create trade by pretending they had. Not a lot of prices changed after lunch.|$|E
