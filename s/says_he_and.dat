5|$|After much research, Bella {{concludes that}} Edward is {{seemingly}} human, but has mysterious powers resembling to a vampire. He eventually confirms this, but <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> the other Cullens only consume animal blood. The pair fall in love, and Edward introduces Bella to his vampire family. Carlisle Cullen, the family patriarch, {{is a doctor}} working at the hospital in Forks. His wife is Esme, and Alice, Jasper, Emmett, and Rosalie, are their informally adopted children. Edward and Bella's relationship is soon put in jeopardy, when three nomadic vampires—James, Victoria, and Laurent—arrive in Forks. James, a tracker vampire with incredible hunting instincts, is instantly intrigued by Edward's protectiveness over a human, which incites him to hunt Bella for sport. Edward and the other Cullens risk their lives to protect Bella, but James tracks her to Phoenix, where she is hiding with Jasper and Alice. James lures Bella into a trap by falsely claiming that he is holding her mother hostage. James attacks Bella by biting her wrist, infecting her with vampire venom. After a ferocious battle, Edward subdues James just as the other Cullens arrive. Alice, Emmett, and Jasper kill James, decapitating and burning him, as Edward removes the venom from Bella's wrist, preventing her from turning into a vampire. In {{the aftermath of the}} battle, Bella has suffered a broken leg, and ends up in the hospital, but her mother comes in to visit. Upon returning to Forks, Edward accompanies Bella to the high school prom, where he refuses to grant her request that he would transform her into a vampire. As the couple dance, they are unaware that James' mate, Victoria, is secretly watching, plotting revenge for her lover's death.|$|E
25|$|Attorney-General, Arthur Rylah, {{rejected}} a second plea to refer Ryan's {{case to the}} Full Court under Section 584 of the Crimes Act. A third attempt to save Ryan, {{in the form of}} a petition presented at the Crown Solicitor's office pleading for clemency, was also rejected. Close secrecy surrounded all government moves on the Ryan case. That evening, a former Pentridge prisoner, Allan John Cane, arrived in Melbourne from Brisbane in a new bid to save Ryan. An affidavit by Cane, which was presented to Cabinet, <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> seven prisoners were outside the cookhouse when they saw and heard a prison warder fire a shot from the No. 1 guard post at Pentridge Prison the day Hodson was shot. Police had interviewed these prisoners but none were called on at the trial to give evidence. Cane was immediately rushed into conference with his solicitor, Bernard Gaynor, who tried to contact cabinet ministers informing them of Cane's arrival. Gaynor telephoned Government House seeking an audience with the Governor, Sir Rohan Delacombe. However, Gaynor was told by a Government House spokesman that nobody would be answering calls until 9am (one hour after Ryan's scheduled execution). Gaynor said Cane's mission had failed.|$|E

If they refuse, then we will raise our hands." [...] Lok Prabha editor Pravin Tokekar said: [...] "The MNS chief has technically not made any inflammatory statement. Even when he <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> his party would go with folded hands to people asking them to leave and only raise hands if they refuse, he treads the ground gingerly without naming any community or party per se". On 3 March, at a party function organised by the MNS at Shivaji Park, after the expiry of the gag order, Raj announced, [...] "I have not given up my mission", thus signalling to his supporters of continuing his stance on the migrant issue.|$|E

Back in the [...] "green reality", Michael goes to the hotel, since Alina had left {{in the middle of}} the night. Once there, Marcus warns Michael and Bird that if they do not find her, Marcus will give himself up to Maxim Basayev, his mobster boss. Back at the station, after looking at evidence, Michael decides to talk to the hotel staff where Alina and Marcus are staying, with Bird, rather than Alina's friends. Later, Michael and Bird go to the home of Greg Hollander (Ron Melendez), one of Alina's friends, but do not find Greg, the person they would like to question regarding Alina's whereabouts. Hollander, who is tied up, kicks down a table as the detectives leave, notifying the cops that he is in there. As the criminals run away, Bird and Michael break into the house; Bird and Michael enter the house, while Bird shoots the two gang members. After that, they speak to Greg, who tells them that Alina constantly talks about how she and her husband have grown apart. Michael goes to search for Alina at a beach and finds her there. The two talk about Marcus and everything that happened previously. Michael explains that she has a chance to start over and takes her back to the hotel. In the [...] "red reality", at Jake's home, Jake <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> Vega can have dinner alone to get to know each other. That night, Michael and Hannah go nude swimming at the college pool.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, SFX named [...] "Love & Monsters" [...] {{as one of}} {{the best}} Sci-Fi TV Mockumentaries, saying that it worked as an example of the genre and was not too bad on rewatch. The article noted that criticisms of the episode ranged from [...] "Kay's overacting and the silly Slitheen-esque monster to {{annoyance}} at how, well, lame the members of LINDA are." [...] Louisa Pearson of The Scotsman noted that hardcore fans would dislike the comedy and the [...] "panto" [...] performance of Kay, but commented, [...] "It's true, this episode came close to being a spoof, but it was actually quite nice to have a rest from the Doctor. Even saving the world gets boring sometimes." [...] Arnold T Blumburg of Now Playing gave the episode a grade of D-. He was positive towards the first 30 minutes, which he described as a [...] "touching little tale" [...] with interesting characters, but called the final 10 minutes [...] "juvenile attack on the audience's intelligence and emotions" [...] that ruined the episode with [...] "a laughable monster and offensive humor at exactly the wrong moment". Digital Spy's Dek Hogan criticised Kay's performance, calling the Abzorbaloff [...] "a marvellous idea and it's a pity his creativity was absorbed by a turn from a visiting comedian". In a review of the series, Stephen Brook of The Guardian stated that he [...] "hated" [...] the episode, describing it as a [...] "parody of Doctor Who fans". The scene where Elton <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> Ursula have [...] "a bit of a love life" [...] was criticised by some commentators, who felt that the resultant implication of having oral sex with a paving slab was unsuitable for Doctor Whos large family audience; others, however, dismissed this dialogue as a harmless joke that children would not understand. [...] "Love & Monsters" [...] was placed in 153rd position in Doctor Who Magazine Mighty 200 reader survey in 2009, which ranked every Doctor Who story to that point in order of preference.|$|E
500|$|Susan and Karl were {{childhood}} sweethearts {{who married}} in 1978, before they both graduated from university. Karl has cheated on Susan twice with Sarah Beaumont (Nicola Charles) and Izzy Hoyland (Natalie Bassingthwaighte) {{and the couple}} have broken up and divorced, but have later reunited and remarried. Woodburne has named the Karl, Susan and Izzy love triangle {{as one of her}} favourite storylines. Woodburne believes that Karl and Susan have a strong connection that is [...] "based upon such a good grounding". Karl and Susan are best friends who enjoy each other's company, share a deep connection and take joy in each other's quirks and ways. Woodburne described them as having a [...] "really solid foundation for a marriage" [...] and she has said that she does not want to see Susan and Karl's relationship break up again. Holy Soap have called Susan and Karl [...] "contenders for the friskiest couple on Ramsay Street". Following their [...] "passionate arguments", the couple enjoy making up together. They have a healthy attraction for each other. Fletcher <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> Woodburne find the scenes [...] "funny". Fletcher said [...] "Karl and Susan every now and again do go through a phase where they become slightly more amorous than in their tougher times and tougher storylines – suffice to say it's not bawdy, but I think the audience will enjoy the fun aspect". Karl and Susan have been caught in the nude together on three occasions; at the beach, in Lou Carpenter's (Tom Oliver) spa and when they went skinny-dipping in the bush. When asked what makes Karl and Susan popular with viewers, Woodburne said [...] "Because I think they're so flawed. There's two things: they make horrendous mistakes, both of them, but they both are coming from a place of well meaning. They're both wanting to try and {{do the right thing and}} be helpful, but so often they get it so terribly wrong, and I think we can all relate to that." ...|$|E
