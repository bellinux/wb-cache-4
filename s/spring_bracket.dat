50|$|The car has a {{top speed}} of 55 mph. There is a {{transmission}} brake operating on a 12.5 in drum fitted behind the gearbox operated by foot pedal and internal expanding 12 in drum brakes on the back axle operated by the handbrake lever. Suspension is by semi-elliptic leaf springs on both front and rear axles with an additional crossways helper spring on the rear. The axle is located by a triangular strut linking axle and chassis and the main drive thrust is transmitted to the car by links between the ends of the axle and forward <b>spring</b> <b>brackets.</b> By this means the springs are only responsible for suspension. Artillery type wheels with wooden spokes were fitted.|$|R

40|$|Thin walled beams warp under {{torsional}} and longitudinal loads. Warping restraint produces high longitudinal stresses. This is {{an analysis}} of the stress distribution in the side members of commercial vehicle chassis frames under the effects of the previously little studied longitudinal loads which may act on a truck chassis through <b>spring</b> hanger <b>brackets.</b> The structure analysed is a model chassis frame consisting of channel section side members and four cross members with different joint connections. The developed theories are incorporated into a special purpose finite element program which may be used in the preliminary stages of chassis frame design. Although the program is only used for the longitudinal load case in this thesis, it is generally applicable for other chassis load cases, including torsion, bending,. [...] etc and combination of these. The theoretical results obtained from the program and the finite element analysis on complete chassis frame models are validated against experiments performed on a strain-gauged chassis frame model constructed with the same dimensions and constructional details as the finite element models with the appropriate loading and boundary conditions. Suggestions for the optimum design and attachment positions for components such as <b>spring</b> hanger <b>bracket</b> which may apply longitudinal loads to the side members of the chassis frame are discussed {{from the point of view}} of longitudinal loadings...|$|R
2500|$|Eventually Maddock was {{installed}} in his own drawing office within the Cooper building, although it was somewhat cramped, being located beneath the works stores. Initially, Maddock's duties revolved around drawing or redrawing existing components and developing refinements on the existing Cooper 500 and 1000 cars. However, in 1953 Maddock was instrumental in introducing two design features that became Cooper trademarks {{for the rest of}} the decade: the curved-tube chassis frame and the [...] "curly leaf" [...] leaf <b>spring</b> location <b>bracket.</b> The car that both of these design innovations were pioneered on was the Mark VIII version of the Cooper 500 Formula Three machine.|$|R

25|$|One of {{the most}} famous cricket matches held at Germantown was that against Lord Hawke's team in 1891. The game was {{attended}} by over 7000 spectators and led to the founding of the Associated Clubs of Philadelphia which selected the top cricketers in Philadelphia each year to represent the city on the Gentlemen of Philadelphia team.

2500|$|American {{practice}} {{for many years}} was to use built-up bar frames, with the smokebox saddle/cylinder structure and drag beam integrated therein. In the 1920s, {{with the introduction of}} [...] "superpower", the cast-steel locomotive bed became the norm, incorporating frames, <b>spring</b> hangers, motion <b>brackets,</b> smokebox saddle and cylinder blocks into a single complex, sturdy but heavy casting. André Chapelon developed a similar structure, welded instead of cast, causing a 30% saving in weight for the 2-10-4 locomotives, the construction of which was begun then abandoned in 1946.|$|R
40|$|This master thesis {{has been}} carried out at Ferruform AB, which is a wholly owned {{subsidiary}} of Scania AB. Ferruform produces rear axle housings, cross members, side members and bumpers for trucks and busses. Ferruform is constantly working to improve their production and a part of these improvements are to raise the internal quality and thus reduce waste. A problem that exists today is to ensure the quality of the rear axles manufactured in the manual welding line. The purpose of this work was to identify the root causes of these problems and find solutions to eliminate them. The work would also introduce and evaluate a methodology for problem solving. The problem solving methodology used in this work is called " 8 -stegsmodellen". This methodology is in use at Scania, but was {{at the time of this}} work not introduced at Ferruform. The work was limited to examining the problem of the reinforcement plates that are welded on the manual welding line. Data and information was gathered through interviews, observations, and internal quality reports. Based on the completed analysis, the study shows that the problems with the placement of the reinforcement plates have three root causes: • Ferruforms collaboration with the design department in Södertälje has not been good enough in the product development process. • Positioning accuracy of the <b>spring</b> <b>brackets</b> are not sufficient enough, for both the physical location and the requirement by drawing. • The working methods for the manual work are not guaranteed in terms of quality. Based on the defined problems a proposal of solutions where created to eliminate the problems. The final chosen solution means that the design of the reinforcement plates is changed and a reference track is created on the plate. This reference track allows Ferruform to both fixture and control the placement of the plate against the current drawing requirements. Further work should be done to improve and enhance the cooperation between Ferruform, as a production unit, and the design department in Södertälje. This should be done early in the product development process to ensure possibility for robust and productive fixation and the ability to control the outcome of the placement of the details.

Main sub-assemblies of bogie frame viz. side frames, transoms, headstocks, longitudinal forms the skeleton of the bogie frame. The sub assemblies are fabricated from flanges, webs, channels and Ribs by welding process. Various types of brackets are welded to the frame {{for the purpose of}} primary and secondary suspension arrangement, alternator suspension arrangement and brake rigging arrangement. Various brackets viz. brake hanger brackets, brake lever hanger brackets, brake cylinder fixing brackets, anchor link <b>brackets,</b> bolster <b>spring</b> suspension <b>brackets,</b> alternator suspension brackets, belt tensioning bracket/s, axle box guides, suspension straps are welded on the bogie frames.

They are 13 ton bogie frame and 16 ton bogie frame. 13 ton bogie frames are being used in the bogies of all non-AC mainline coaches and 16 ton bogie frames are being used in bogies of all AC coaches, power cars and diesel multiple unit trailer coaches.

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to {{continue}} {{the development of a}} temporary rail system for a robotic tank inspection device. The tanks to be inspected are in a hazardous environment that is dangerous to work in and navigate. A remotely controlled robot could reduce the need for manual labor in the tanks to initial setup, final removal, and touch ups. Similar setups have been created for inspecting tanks, but they are permanent installations and are meant only for inspections. The goal of the current phase of the project was to employ a new concept for supporting the rail system, create a working prototype, and analyze the effects of loads on the design. The rail system must be economical, quickly deployable, and safe. By modifying a <b>spring</b> compressor, a <b>bracket</b> was created that securely clamps to a tank service flange. From the bracket, a hanger was attached that allows PVC to be used as the rail for the inspection robot. This design is an improvement in terms of ease of installation and removal, practicality, and simplicity. Some issues to be resolved include decreasing flange-to-rail clearance, making the rail more rigid, and wiring the robot to the cart that traverses the rails. When the system is put to use, it will create better working conditions for many laborers. [URL]...|$|R
