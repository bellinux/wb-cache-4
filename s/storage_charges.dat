The leakage current-voltage and capacitance-voltage curves under three fundamental visible light wavelengths, i. e., red, {{green and blue}} light were measured. The apparent <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> density in the negative voltage range was quantified from the capacitance-voltage curve; charges in the positive voltage range were estimated from the leakage current-voltage curve. The measurement was verified with a pre-fabricated circuit which is a <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> readout device. The diode under the long wavelength light illumination condition stored more charges than that under the short wavelength light illumination condition because the former could penetrate the intrinsic a-Si:H layer deeper than the latter could. The leakage current and <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> capacity of the diode {{are determined by the}} generation of electron-hole pairs and the depletion of charges in the intrinsic layer as well as the supply of charges from the electrodes. A comparison of <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> capacities of diodes with different intrinsic layer thicknesses is also presented. The number of photogenerated carriers increases with the thickness of the i-layer due to the long penetration depth, but the junction capacitance decreases which results in the decrease of the <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> capacity. The tradeoff between the photogenerated carriers and the capacitance, combined with thickness-dependent recombination mechanisms increases the complexity of the PIN diode <b>charge</b> <b>storage</b> capacity.

The device features oxide–nitride–oxide (ONO) stack as the charge storage medium {{in one of}} the two gated sides with pure oxide in the other. Owing to the IDG feature, the shift in the device’s transfer characteristics due to a change in the amount of <b>storage</b> <b>charges</b> can be sensed with two different modes, which have one of the two gates applied with a sweeping bias (driving gate) and the other with a fixed bias (control gate). Our analysis and experimental data show that a larger memory window is obtained when the gate of the ONO side is used as the driving gate. Moreover, the memory window of this mode is essentially independent of the bias applied to the control gate. Based on this finding, a novel Flash structure featuring IDG cells with a common control gate is proposed.

Moreover, the direct method provides good initial estimations which can be improved w. r. t. accuracy and reliability by an indirect method, e. g. the indirect multiple shooting method MUMUS. Furthermore, a brief outline about the theoretical analysis of the state constrained optimal control problem - including the derivation of necessary conditions - and its numerical solution by means of the indirect method is represented. Besides, the complex switching structure of the optimal controls, which results from the appearance of singular subarcs and overlapping boundary arcs of two active state constraints, is remarkable. ...|$|E

It is therefore not surprising that many logistical planning problems are computationally difficult, and finding a good solution to these problems necessitates the development of many ad hoc algorithmic procedures to address various features of the planning problems. In this paper, we identify simple conditions and structural properties associated with these logistical planning problems. Despite the nonlinear cost structures in the problems, we show that a solution that is within -optimality can be obtained by solving a related piece-wise linear concave cost multi-commodity network flow problem. An immediate consequence of this result is that certain classes of logistical planning problems can be approximated by a factor of (1 +) in polynomial time. This significantly improves upon the results found in literature for these classes of problems. We also show that the piece-wise linear concave cost network flow problem can be approximated to within a logarithmic factor via a large scale linear programming relaxation. We use polymatroidal constraints to capture the piece-wise concavity feature of the cost functions. This gives rise to a unified and generic LP-based approach for a large class of complicated logistical planning problems. 1...|$|E
