40|$|Starch, as {{a natural}} polymer, can be {{processed}} by techniques such as extrusion into films/sheets, foams, <b>shaped</b> <b>articles,</b> etc. During processing, starch experiences a phase transition (gelatinization/melting) from native granular form to homogeneous molten form, which can be enhanced by shear treatment. The processing rheology of starch melt has {{a close relationship with}} thermomechanical input. Both phase transition and rheology play critical roles in starch processing and can be largely influenced by plasticizer type and content and starch type and structure (amylose/amylopectin ratios). Due to the inherent drawbacks of starch, starch-based blends (e. g., with biodegradable aliphatic polyesters) and (nano) composites (e. g., with cellulose or nanoclays) have been widely examined. The production of high-performance plasticized starch-based materials relies on the facility (extruder, die, takeoff device, etc.), sample preparation and processing strategies (plasticizer addition method, blending sequence, orientation, etc.), and the control of processing conditions (temperature, pressure, shear rate, etc.) ...|$|R

40|$|Poly(arylenevinylene) s are {{considered}} to be promising candidates for electrical andlor optical materials. Most of these polymers are neither fusible nor soluble in common solvents, making it difficult to process them into <b>shaped</b> <b>articles.</b> The synthetic procedures have mostly involved the preparation of a precursor poly-mer which is processible, usually in solution, and which can then be converted into the desired poly(arylenevinylene); alternatively, these conjugated polymers can be rendered soluble and therefore processible in organic solvents by attaching large lipophilic groups to the arylenevinylene moiety. The precursor route involves produdng a polymer in which the arylene units are connected by ethylene units. The saturated units contain a group which not only solubilizes the macromolecule and allows processing, but which can under suitable condi-tions also act as a leaving group, thus affording the saturated vinylene units of a fully conjugated polymer.

Third, while objective review criteria influence acceptance/rejection decisions, subjective assessment {{on the part of the}} program committees may also play a substantial role.

The complex deep drawing of thin metallic sheets is widely used during industrial material forming applications. It allows production of thin walled parts with complicated shapes such as automotive panels or structural parts. The process consists of the plastic deformation of an initial at blank subjected to the action of a rigid punch and die while constrained on the periphery by a blank holder. Conventional design processes for sheet metal forming are usually based on a empirical approach. However, due to the requirement of high precision and reliability in shaped parts, these methods are far away from a final and reliable solution. Nowadays, Finite Element Method (FEM) is being gradually adopted by industry to envisage the formability properties of sheet metals. The design and control of a deep drawing process depends {{not only on the}} work piece material, but also on the condition at the tool work piece interface, the mechanics of plastic deformation and the equipment used.
