5|$|Caracciola {{started from}} the second row of the grid at the German Grand Prix, but was into the lead soon after the <b>start.</b> <b>There</b> he {{remained}} to the finish, in front of von Brauchitsch and Rosemeyer. He took pole position at the Monaco Grand Prix three weeks later, and was soon engaged in a hard fight with von Brauchitsch. The Mercedes-Benz drivers took the lead from each other several times, but von Brauchitsch won after a screw fell into Caracciola's induction system during a pit stop, costing him {{three and a half}} minutes. Caracciola won his second race of the season at the Swiss Grand Prix. Despite heavy rain which made the Bremgarten Circuit slippery and hazardous, Caracciola set a new lap record, at an average speed of , and cemented his reputation as the Regenmeister.|$|E
5|$|At the <b>start,</b> <b>there</b> {{were one}} or two daily round trips with steam locomotive-hauled trains. In {{the first year of}} operation, the line transported 18,500 passengers. The initial ticket price from Sandnes to Ålgård was NOK1.50, {{compared}} to NOK1 for a bus ticket. This was in part because NSB operated with a standard price based on the length of the line, and the line was longer than the corresponding roads. After a while NSB's board accepted that tickets be priced {{as if they were the}} length of the road, and the price was reduced to NOK1.10. Because of competition from truck drivers picking up random passengers for NOK0.75, the price was then reduced to NOK0.80 in 1927. The line made a profit during until the late 1940s, after which it started to operate with a deficit. In the financial year 1948–49, the line transported 79,700 passengers.|$|E
5|$|Saeed captained Iraq {{through the}} 1986 FIFA World Cup qualifiers in 1985, playing 8 matches and scoring 8 goals {{including}} four against Lebanon in two 6–0 wins for Iraq, a winning goal against Jordan in Iraq's 3–2 win, which was Saeed's 100th appearance with the senior national team. Iraq {{finished in the}} top of the Group 1B table at 6 points in the first round, getting qualified to the 1986 FIFA World Cup qualification – AFC Second Round. Saeed scored two goals in Iraq's 3–2 away win over the UAE. They lost 2–1 in their home match which qualified them to the final round on away goals. Saeed also scored in Iraq's victorious match against Syria in Taif in which Iraq won 3–1 getting qualified for the first time of their history to the FIFA World Cup after ending their away match in a 0–0 draw. When the 1986 FIFA World Cup was about to <b>start,</b> <b>there</b> were some speculations about Saeed not being in Iraq's squad, due to his injury, but he joined the team in the last moments. On 4 June, Saeed played in Iraq's first match against Paraguay, where they were defeated by a single goal. After the match, Iraq's head coach, Evaristo de Macedo, discontinued Saeed from the squad, due to his former injury, and sent him back to Baghdad. Iraq lost their two other matches against Belgium and Mexico, getting knocked out from the group stage of the cup. Since then, Iraq was not able to qualify to the World Cup.|$|E

25|$|Boys {{also had}} a role in the mystery and {{controversy}} surrounding Napoleon's Death Mask. As was the custom for major leaders of the time, a death mask impression of Napoleon's face was taken shortly after his demise. Right from the <b>start</b> <b>there</b> were conflicting reports of who took the impression and when, and in whose possession it was then. Soon there were various and hugely differing masks appearing around Europe all purporting to be the genuine article. While the main focus of the debate ranged around whether the original had been taken by Dr Burton or Dr Antommarchi, both of whom had been physicians attending to Napoleon {{at the time of his}} death, another mask appeared in the possession of Dr J. O. Sankey, a grandson of Boys. This mask (commonly known as the Sankey mask), purported to have been taken by Joseph William Buridge, an English artist that had made a famous sketch of Napoleon on his deathbed. The providence of this item was supported by a written testimony from the Rev. Mr. Boys himself.|$|E
25|$|Once all {{the cars}} have formed on the grid, a light system above the track {{indicates}} {{the start of the}} race: five red lights are illuminated at intervals of one second; they are all then extinguished simultaneously after an unspecified time (typically less than 3 seconds) to signal the start of the race. The start procedure may be abandoned if a driver stalls on the grid, signalled by raising his arm. If this happens, the procedure restarts: a new formation lap begins with the offending car removed from the grid. The race may also be restarted {{in the event of a}} serious accident or dangerous conditions, with the original start voided. The race may be started from behind the Safety Car if officials feel a racing start would be excessively dangerous, such as extremely heavy rainfall. As of the 2017 season there will always be a standing restart. If due to heavy rainfall a start behind the safety car is necessary, then after the track has dried sufficiently, drivers will form up for a standing <b>start.</b> <b>There</b> is no formation lap when races start behind the Safety Car.|$|E

Bill Lamb from About.com noted that before Rihanna's vocals <b>start,</b> <b>there</b> is an internal buildup of [...] "dreamy drum machine rhythms".

Eriksen, Tor Erik Hermansen, Ester Dean, Traci Hale and Drake and incorporates themes of [...] "sex and romance". Jocelyn Vena from MTV described the vocal delivery and lyrical content of the song as [...] "sassy". Lamb as said that [...] "lyrically, [...] amounts to romantic, sexual sweet nothings". Rihanna called the collaboration [...] "young and playful", something which Stacy Anderson from Spin and Nick Levine of Digital Spy both picked up, when commenting on the sexual innuendos in the lyrics.

Their home is {{in a small town in}} the Middle West, and Ella has never seen New York (City), although she has always wanted to go there. Her father, finding times hard, decides to take a chance in the gold fields of Alaska, and when the play opens, is about to <b>start</b> <b>there.</b> He leaves Ella in the care of an aunt, a sour old person who runs a boarding house, who promptly makes a drudge out of the girl. As she has no other relatives, there is nothing for her to do except submit. Sitting in her room one evening, tired after a day's hard work, she looks at her two treasured magazines, one showing views of her pet city and the other giving the latest fashion. The girl is filled with a longing to travel and wear pretty clothes, and falls asleep. In her dream she is transported to New York, where she finds enough money to enable her to buy all the pretty things she admires. Ella greatly enjoys her visit, and is extremely unhappy when she wakes up. But she finds that her dream will become reality before long, for her father has returned from the gold fields with a fortune and a desire to fulfill all the wishes of his pretty daughter." ...|$|E
