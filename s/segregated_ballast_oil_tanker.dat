50|$|Category 1 tankers {{have been}} phased out in 2005. These {{so-called}} preMARPOL tankers were single hull only with some <b>segregated</b> <b>ballast</b> tanks. Around {{one third of}} the cargo tanks also acted as ballast tanks. During <b>ballast</b> discharge <b>oil</b> was released into the environment. These tankers did not extend high above the water line, allowing Hydrostatically Balanced Loading (HBL), so relatively little oil was spilled in case of bottom damage.|$|R

40|$|The {{continuous}} {{addition of}} toluene as a solute of treated <b>ballast</b> water from <b>oil</b> <b>tankers</b> into a well-defined estuary facilitated {{the study of}} the dynamics of dissolved hydrocarbon metabolism in seawater. Most rates of toluene oxidation were in the range of 1 to 30 pg/liter per h at 0. 5 μg of toluene per liter. Near the ballast water injection point, a layer of warm ballast water, rich in bacteria, that was trapped below the less-dense fresh surface water was located. Toluene residence times were approximately 2 weeks in this layer, 2 years elsewhere in Port Valdez, and 2 decades in the surface water of a more oceanic receiving estuary adjacent. Mixing was adequate for a steady-state treatment which showed that 98 % of the toluene was flushed from Port Valdez before metabolism and gave a steady-state concentration of 0. 18 μg/liter. Total bacterial biomass from direct counts and organism size data was usually near 0. 1 mg/liter, but ranged up to 0. 8 mg/liter in the bacteria-rich layer. The origin of bacteria in this layer was traced to growth in <b>oil</b> <b>tanker</b> <b>ballast</b> during shipments. The biomass of toluene oxidizers in water samples was estimated from the average affinity of pure-culture isolates for toluene (28 liters per g of cells per h) and observed toluene oxidation kinetics. Values ranged from nearly all of the total bacterial biomass within the bacteria-rich layer down to 0. 2 % at points far removed. Because the population of toluene oxidizers was large with respect to the amount of toluene consumed and because water from a nearby nonpolluted estuary was equally active in facilitating toluene metabolism, we searched for an additional hydrocarbon source. It was found that terpenes could be washed from spruce trees by simulated rainfall, which suggested that riparian conifers provide an additional and significant hydrocarbon source to seawater...|$|R
