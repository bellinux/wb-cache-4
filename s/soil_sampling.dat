25|$|Geotechnical {{investigations}} are performed by geotechnical engineers or engineering geologists {{to obtain information}} on the physical properties of soil and rock around a site to design earthworks and foundations for proposed structures and for repair of distress to earthworks and structures caused by subsurface conditions. This type of investigation is called a site investigation. Additionally, geotechnical {{investigations are}} also {{used to measure the}} thermal resistivity of soils or backfill materials required for underground transmission lines, oil and gas pipelines, radioactive waste disposal, and solar thermal storage facilities. A geotechnical investigation will include surface exploration and subsurface exploration of a site. Sometimes, geophysical methods are used to obtain data about sites. Subsurface exploration usually involves <b>soil</b> <b>sampling</b> and laboratory tests of the soil samples retrieved.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of Lisle, Illinois, {{releases}} of trichloroethylene (TCE) had allegedly occurred on the Lockformer property beginning in 1968 and continuing for an undetermined period. The company used TCE {{in the past as}} a degreaser to clean metal parts. Contamination at the Lockformer site is presently under investigation by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and Illinois EPA. In 1992, Lockformer conducted <b>soil</b> <b>sampling</b> on their property and found TCE in the soil at levels as high as 680 parts per million (ppm). During the summer of 2000, a group of residents hired legal counsel, and on October 11, 2000, these residents had their private well water tested by a private environmental consultant. The group owned homes south of the Lockformer property in the suspected path of groundwater flow. The consultant collected a second round of well water samples on November 10, 2000, and TCE was detected in some of the wells sampled. Beginning in December 2000, Illinois EPA collected about 350 more private well water samples north and south of the Lockformer property.|$|E
40|$|By {{analyzing}} the cation composition of pore {{water in the}} <b>soil</b> <b>samples</b> of Ariake Bay sediments, the present study assesses the development of quick clay by leaching in both the original and seawa-ter-saturated <b>soil</b> <b>samples.</b> Divalent cations were dominant in the pore water of the original <b>soil</b> <b>sample,</b> whereas Na+ was the major cation in that of the seawater-saturated <b>soil</b> <b>sample.</b> The ca-tion proportion in the pore water for both <b>soil</b> <b>samples</b> remained the same after leaching. The dif-ference in pore water cation composition between the original and seawater-saturated soil sam-ples affected how their geotechnical properties changed through leaching.

Hence, sensitivity was not increased and quick clay was not formed. However, in the seawater-saturated <b>soil</b> <b>sample,</b> the remolded shear strength decreased to a great extent, and quick clay with a sensitivity exceeding 700 developed. The lack of development of quick clay in the original <b>soil</b> <b>sample</b> is attributed to the dominance of divalent cations in the por...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{was carried out}} to investigate the effect of <b>soil</b> <b>sample</b> preservation methods on dissolved nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon contents in Dutch grassland soils fertilized with improved cattle slurry manure quality by comparing the analytical results of <b>soil</b> <b>samples</b> preserved moist at- 4 oC in cold room and the same <b>soil</b> <b>samples</b> preserved after oven dried at 40 oC for 48 hours.

25|$|Between May 13–14, 2004 {{the site}} was {{enclosed}} with temporary mesh fencing and plain-clothed security guards commenced patrols of the public areas. At 02:00 on May 15 bulldozers arrived at the site and tree-felling began at 07:00. The work caused immediate concern to nearby residents who feared the work might unsettle asbestos deposits in the ground. Residents formed the Save Spodden Valley action group the following week. Residents also protested to Rochdale Council, which subsequently issued an emergency tree preservation order on six parts of the site, preventing the removal of trees without permission of planning officers, and carrying a fine of up to £20,000 per tree. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) also secured a voluntary arrangement to halt any work that could disturb soil on the site pending <b>soil</b> <b>sampling.</b> Former Turner's employees and local residents claimed that, {{as recently as the}} 1960s, asbestos dust and fibres were clearly visible hanging from the trees, and that a disused coalmine shaft exposed by the tree felling had been used over a period of decades to dump hundreds of tonnes of asbestos waste.|$|E
25|$|Originally, CRREL cold-room {{facilities}} used trichloroethylene (TCE) as a refrigerant. At {{the time there}} were few known environmental hazards attributed to TCE. Subsequently, TCE {{has been identified as}} a carcinogen. In 1970, an industrial accident resulted in a spill of approximately 3,000 gallons of TCE. In 1978, TCE was introduced into the ground via an experimental well. After the 1990 discovery of TCE in groundwater, CRREL embarked on a remediation plan, approved by the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES), with assistance from the U.S. Army Toxic and Hazardous Materials Agency and the Corps of Engineers New England Division. NHDES reports that CRREL no longer stores TCE on site and the remediation of TCE in the groundwater is subject to monitoring in test wells. According to an Army press release cited in the local newspaper, the Army expanded monitoring of TCE at other locations on the CRREL campus and found some elevated readings in 2011. Thereafter, they initiated a monitoring well and <b>soil</b> <b>sampling</b> program to map the concentrations of the substance on the site. The information gained should lead to a new cleanup strategy for the site, according to the 2012 report. Army environmental specialists have detected TCE at neighboring residential and school properties.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{methods used}} to analyze archaeological sites are {{relevant}} to the analysis of landscapes. The archaeology of landscapes incorporates multiple research methods into its analysis {{in order to ensure that}} multiple sources of information are gathered; allowing for a sound interpretation of the site in question. These methods include pollen analysis, Geographic Information Systems, <b>soil</b> <b>sampling,</b> faunal analysis, ground penetrating radar, archival data (including maps and census data), and of course archaeological excavation methods. [...] Pollen, soil, faunal, and floral analysis allows the archaeologist to understand the natural vegetation of an area, vegetation that was actively grown by area settlers, and the animal life that also lived in the area. An understanding of the plant and animal life specific to an area can lead to, for example, an analysis of the types of food available to members of the community, an understanding of the actual diet typical for a subset of a population, and site and skeletal dating. [...] If landscape reconstruction and preservation, in particular, is a goal of an archaeological research project, pollen and soil analysis can aide in landscape archaeology to accurately interpret and reconstruct landscapes of the past (Schoenwetter pg 278).|$|E
2500|$|Operation Ranch Hand was {{the name}} of the aerial {{application}} of defoliants in Southeast Asia, aimed at stripping away the dense jungle that hid enemy activities. The center for US testing of the herbicides used in Ranch Hand was Eglin AFB, primarily on Range C-52A. For ten years, 1961 to 1971, 222,530 liters of herbicides (Agents Purple, Orange, White and Blue) were sprayed at a test grid on the base reservation. These herbicides were estimated to contain at least 3.1kg of dioxin. <b>Soil</b> <b>sampling</b> at the test site conducted in 1970–1987 confirmed that there was TCDD contamination, though only about 1 percent remained. [...] "Researchers theorized that much of the dioxin was broken down in the hot Florida sun or relocated due to wind or water erosion. At the storage and loading site west of the airstrip, residual dioxin was also found. [...] Mitigation efforts were conducted, including the construction of a concrete drainage ditch and the building of a sediment pond to keep the dioxin from migrating into the nearby ravine and water bodies that lead to the city of Fort Walton Beach water supply.
