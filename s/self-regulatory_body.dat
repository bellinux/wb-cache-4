40|$|BACKGROUND: The alleged {{efficacy}} of pharmaceutical industry self-regulation {{has been used}} to repudiate increased government oversight over promotional activity. European politicians and industry have cited Sweden as an excellent example of self-regulation based on an ethical code. This paper considers antidepressant advertising in Sweden to uncover {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} self-regulation. METHODOLOGY: We analyzed all antidepressant advertisements in the Swedish Medical Journal, 1994 - 2003. The regulation of these advertisements was analyzed using case reports from <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>bodies.</b> The authors independently reviewed this material to investigate: (1) extent of violative advertising; (2) pattern of code breaches; (3) rate at which the system reacted to violative advertising; (4) prevalence of and oversight over claims regarding antidepressant efficacy and disease causality, and (5) costs for manufactures associated with violative advertising. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: <b>Self-regulatory</b> <b>bodies</b> identified numerous code breaches. Nonetheless, they failed to protect doctors from unreliable information on antidepressants, since as many as 247 of 722 (34 %) advertisements breached the industry code. <b>Self-regulatory</b> <b>bodies</b> repeatedly failed to challenge inflated claims of antidepressant efficacy, lending evidence of lax oversight. On average, 15 weeks elapsed between printing and censure of a wrongful claim, and in 25 % of cases 47 weeks or more elapsed. Industry paid roughly € 108000 in fines for violative advertising, adding an estimated additional average cost of 11 % to each purchased violative advertisement, or amounting to as little as 0. 009 % of total antidepressant sales of around € 1. 2 billion. CONCLUSIONS: Lax oversight, combined with lags in the system and low fines for violations, may explain the Swedish system's failure to pressure companies into providing reliable antidepressants information. If these shortcomings prove to be consistent across self-regulatory settings, and if appropriate measures are not taken to amend shortcomings, many countries may want to reconsider the current balance between self-regulation, and legislative control with government oversight...|$|R

40|$|A (correctly designed) {{voluntary}} self-regulatory scheme can - {{in theory}} - improve social welfare if {{the benefits to}} society outweigh the costs. However, businesses may not choose {{to participate in a}} voluntary scheme if their private benefits do not outweigh their costs; external benefits are irrelevant to the profit maximizing firm. This paper reviews literature on self-regulation, primarily focusing on factors that influence the net private benefits of environmental programmes. The literature is summarized in a manner that allows one to identify characteristics of firms that are most likely to accrue positive net benefit from environmental programmes, and to determine ways in which <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>bodies</b> might raise those benefits, thereby increasing participation rates...|$|R

40|$|The author {{considers}} propositions {{that market}} and network governance are supplanting hierarchical governance in contemporary UK media and communications, Liberalisation {{of media and}} communication markets, adoption of new public management in publicly owned bodies, “outsourcing” of regulation from statutory to <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>bodies</b> and “fourth way” co-ordination of Internet institutions suggest {{that the importance of}} markets and networks as potentially “homeostatic” modes of governance is growing. However, hierarchical governance remains important, the Communications Act 2003 prescribes more than 260 duties for the statutory regulator, Ofcom, and the BBC makes a major intervention in broadcasting markets. All three forms of governance fail in distinctive ways and the author argues both that the potential for network governance failure is less well recognised than are market and hierarchy failures and that the complexity of established governance arrangements itself constitutes a distinctive form of failure of governance...|$|R
