40|$|A medetomidina um sedativo e analgésico do grupo dos agonistas alfa 2 adrenérgicos aprovada para cães e gatos, descrita atualmente como mais potente do que a xilazina, antiga agonista alfa 2 adrenérgica de uso veterinário. A {{principal}} diferença entre esses dois agonistas é a seletividade aos receptores alfa 2 -adrenérgicos, sendo a medetomidina considerada mais seletiva, conferindo, portanto, maior potência sedativa e analgésica. A reversão dos efeitos dos agonistas alfa 2 -adrenérgicos é realizada com o uso dos antagonistas alfa 2 -adrenérgicos, sendo o atipamezole o mais eficiente devido a sua maior seletividade. O objetivo deste trabalho foi comparar os efeitos da medetomidina e xilazina em gatos, e comprovar a reversão desses efeitos induzidos por esses dois agonistas com atipamezole. Concluiu-se que a medetomidina e a xilazina apresentam efeitos semelhantes na maioria dos parâmetros avaliados, porém a medetomidina induziu hiperglicemia e sedação mais acentuada do que a xilazina. O atipamezole apresentou excelente eficácia, antagonizando todos os efeitos induzidos pela medetomidina e a xilazina. The medetomidine is sedative and analgesic of {{the group}} of the a 2 adrenergic agonist approved for dogs and cats, described now as more potent than the xylazine, an old agonist a 2 adrenergic of veterinary use. The main difference among those two agonists is the selectivity to the receptors a 2 -adrenergics, being the medetomidine considered more <b>selective,</b> <b>checking,</b> therefore, larger sedative and analgesic potency. The reversion of the effects of a 2 -adrenergics is accomplished {{with the use of the}} a 2 -adrenergics antagonists, being the atipamezole the most efficient due to his largest selectivity. The objective of this work was to accomplish a comparative study of the effects of the medetomidine and xylazine in cats, and to prove the reversion of the induced effects of these two agonists with atipamezole. It was concluded that the medetomidine and the xylazine present similar effects in most of the appraised parameters, however the medetomidina induced hyperglycemia and sedation more accentuated than the xylazine. The atipamezole presented excellent effectiveness, antagonizing all of the effects induced by the medetomidine and the xylazine...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Mobile ad hoc {{networks}} (MANET) {{have more}} severe operating conditions than traditional wireless networks. The MAC protocol of IEEE 802. 11 mitigates collisions and ensures error-free packet transmissions {{at the cost}} of limiting capacity and increasing latency. For voice transmission over MANETs this cost should be minimized. We propose and examine <b>selective</b> error <b>checking</b> (SEC) at the MAC layer of 802. 11 that takes advantage of {{the fact that many of}} the speech bits can tolerate errors while other bits must be protected for effective reconstruction of the speech. Simulation results demonstrate that the network performance and the speech quality are substantially improved by modifying the MAC layer with SEC to suit a particular GSM speech compression standard, the Narrow-Band Adaptive MultiRate (NB-AMR) coder operating at a rate of 7. 95 kbps. 1 I...|$|R
40|$|Quality-of-service (QoS) {{requirements}} for the timely delivery of real-time multimedia raise new challenges for the networking world. A key component of QoS is QoS rout-ing which allows the selection of network routes with sufficient resources for requested QoS parameters. Several techniques have been proposed in the literature to compute QoS routes, most of which require dynamic update of link-state information across the Inter-net. Given the growing size of the Internet, {{it is becoming increasingly}} difficult to gather up-to-date state information in a dynamic environment. We propose a new technique to compute QoS routes on the Internet in a fast and efficient manner without any need for dynamic updates. Our method, known as <b>Selective</b> Flooding, <b>checks</b> the state of the links on a set of pre-computed routes from the source to the destination in parallel and based on this information computes the best route and then reserves resources. We implemented Selective Flooding on a QoS routing simulator and evaluated the performance of Selec-tive Flooding compared to source routing for a variety of network parameters. We find Selective Flooding consistently outperforms source routing in terms of call-blocking rat...|$|R
50|$|Astute {{consumers}} and criminal minded {{people have been}} able to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in the credit scoring systems to obtain credit. For example, previous ownership of a credit card may significantly increase an individual's ability to obtain further credit, while privacy issues may prevent a fraud from being exposed. Certain telecommunication companies and their relationship with credit reporting bureaus have enabled fabricated credit files to be created by the exploit of privacy blocks, which deny any third party entity to actual information held by the government. While the credit reporting system is designed to protect both lenders and borrowers, there are loopholes which can allow opportunistic individuals to abuse the system. A few of the motivations and techniques for credit abuse include churning, rapidfire credit applications, repetitive credit <b>checks,</b> <b>selective</b> credit freezes, applications for small business rather than personal credit, and piggybacking.|$|R
40|$|The {{urgent need}} of {{neuraminidase}} inhibitors (NI) has provided an impetus {{for understanding the}} structure requisite at molecular level. Our search for selective inhibitors of neuraminidase {{has led to the}} identification of pharmacophoric requirements at various positions around acyl thiourea pharmacophore. The main objective of present study is to develop selective NI, with least toxicity and drug like ADMET properties. Electronic, Steric requirements were defined using kohnone nearest neighbour- molecular field analysis (kNN-MFA) model of 3 D-QSAR studies. Results generated by QSAR studies showed that model has good internal as well as external predictivity. Such defined requirements were used to generate new chemical entities which exhibit higher promising predicted activities. To <b>check</b> <b>selective</b> binding of designed NCE’s docking studies were carried out using the crystal structure of the neuraminidase enzyme having co-crystallized ligand Oseltamivir. Thus, molecular modelling provided a good platform to optimize the acyl thiourea pharmacophore for designing its derivatives having potent anti-viral activit...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Indigenous gut {{bacteria}} of the Formosan subter-ranean termite (Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki, Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae) {{were used}} as shuttle systems to deliver, express and spread foreign genes in termite colonies. The gut bacterium Enterobacter cloacae was transformed with a recombinant plasmid (pEGFP) containing genes encod-ing ampicillin resistance and green fluorescent protein (GFP). In laboratory experiments, termite workers and soldiers from three colonies were fed with filter paper inoculated with transformed bacteria. Transformed bacteria were de-tected in termite guts by growing the entire gut flora under <b>selective</b> conditions and <b>checking</b> the cultures visually for fluorescence. We demonstrated that (1) transformed bacte-ria were ingested {{within a few hours}} and the GFP gene was expressed in the termite gut; (2) transformed bacteria es-tablished a persistent population in the termite gut for up to 11 weeks; (3) transformed bacteria were efficiently trans-ferred throughout a laboratory colony, even when the donor (termites initially fed with transformed bacteria) to recipient (not fed) ratio was low; (4) transformed E. cloacae were transferred into soil; however, they did not accumulate over time and the GFP plasmid was not transferred to other soil bacteria. In the future, transgenic bacteria may be used to shuttle detrimental genes into termite colonies for improved pest control...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{software}} countermeasures {{specifically designed to}} counteract fault injection attacks during the execution of a software implementation of a cryptographic algorithm and analyze the efficiency of these countermeasures. We propose two approaches based on the insertion of redundant computations and checks, which in their general form are suitable for any cryptographic algorithm. In particular, we focus on selective instruction duplication to detect single errors, instruction triplication to support error correction, and parity checking to detect corruption of a stored value. We developed a framework to automatically add the desired countermeasure, and we support the possibility to apply the selected redundancy to either all the instructions of the cryptographic routine or restrict it to the most sensitive ones, such as table lookups and key fetching. Considering an ARM processor as a target platform and AES as a target algorithm, we evaluate the overhead of the proposed countermeasures while keeping the robustness of the implementation high enough to thwart {{most or all of}} the known fault attacks. Experimental results show that in the considered architecture, the solution with the smallest overhead is per-instruction <b>selective</b> doubling and <b>checking,</b> and that the instruction triplication scheme is a viable alternative if very high levels of injected fault resistance are required...|$|R
40|$|This paper, {{after an}} {{introduction}} {{about the state}} of the art in the methods for the evaluation of Hg chemical speciation,focuses on Hg polluted soils and sediments from Siele mining area (Piancastagnaio, Siena, Italy). In particular, the mineralogicalcomposition was evaluated via X-ray powder diffraction, total Hg was determined via inductively coupled plasma optical emissionspectroscopy on acid digested samples, and Hg binding forms were investigated both via sequential selective extraction andpyrolytic extraction. Solutions obtained via sequential <b>selective</b> extraction were <b>checked</b> for Hg content using inductively coupledplasma optical emission spectroscopy, whereas to carry out pyrolytic extraction a thermogravimetric analyser coupled with anevolved gas mass spectrometer was used. To our knowledge, this last method was never used for this purpose on natural samples. Experimental results enhance that: i) Hg detection via thermal analyses can qualitatively distinguish among different Hg compounds. ii) The temperature of Hg thermal release is affected by both the sample matrix and the Hg bond type. iii) Thermal analysesfail in the attempt of a quantitative determination of the evolved species; this goal is better achieved via the selective chemical leaching. iv) Most of the Hg is related to HgS-like bonds, thus pointing to the presence of very stable Hg compounds. v) Only in somesamples we found also organo-complexed Hg-like compounds and, in a limited amount, hydrosoluble Hg and/or Hg species solublein weakly acid environment. vi) No correlation between sampling point and both total Hg and/or Hg speciation was observed...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: With the {{improvement}} in anastomotic technique, it is rare to find anastomotic site leak after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). It {{may not always be}} necessary to do regular check cystogram before catheter removal. We evaluated our 230 consecutive RARP patients and their cystograms to determine the indications for selective use of cystogram before catheter removal. Materials and Methods: We reviewed our prospectively collected RARP database of 230 consecutive patients. Cystography was performed at low pressure by gravity instillation of diluted contrast through the catheter. Patients were observed under fluoroscopy in lateral oblique position for any contrast leak at the site of anastomosis. All patients were followed for a minimum of 6 months, and the longest follow-up was 5 years. Results: A total of 207 patients (90 %) underwent catheter removal on postoperative day 7. Nine patients (3. 9 %) had extravasation on initial cystogram. Two patients with leak had a history of transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) and seven other had bladder neck reconstruction for wide bladder neck. Three patients with minimal leak did not require catheter replacement. In rest of the 6 patient with leak, continued catheter drainage was done. No significant difference in the intraoperative variables, blood loss, duration of drain, length of hospital stay, and continence outcomes was noted between the patients with leak compared to rest of the patients. None of the patient needed any procedure/intervention related to the surgery and none developed bladder neck stenosis. Conclusion: In usual circumstances, catheter removal can be done safely on a postoperative day 7 without routine cystography. <b>Selective</b> use of <b>check</b> cystogram can be done in the case where bladder neck reconstruction is performed or those had a prior TURP and a wide bladder neck...|$|R
40|$|Background: Recently {{around the}} world, the {{global climate change}} caused the {{decrease}} in the food production. Besides this, traditional farming and amount of cultivable land are also decreasing. As an alternative to these problems, more {{attention is paid to}} the plant factory. Automated nutrient sensing and control for plant factory (e. g., closed hydroponic system) would allow more efficient use and management of nutrients for crop production. An attempt has been taken to test the components along with the nutrient management system for plant factory. Methods: The nutrient management system was divided into two parts - sensing and controlling part. First, a data acquisition code was made using Lab View 2011. Using NI USB 6009 device, performance of EC, pH, NO 3 and K ion <b>selective</b> electrodes were <b>checked</b> by measuring the correlated components in standard and real-time nutrient solution. A mixing algorithm was developed to control the individual solution volume to be supplied depending on their concentration in the mixing tank. Results: The EC, pH, NO 3 and K sensors were tested in a standard solution of 3, 4, 100 mg L- 1 and 10 mg L- 1. Standard deviations after calibration and regression between before and after calibration were 0. 189, 0. 245, 1. 371, 1. 400 and 0. 902, 0. 885, 0. 829, 0. 861 for EC, pH, NO 3 and K sensors, respectively. After rinsing the standard error reduced to 16. 69 % and 42. 16 % for NO 3 and K ISE sensors, respectively. Discussion: Errors occurred due to signal drift and bio-film formation in the sensors head. Signal processing algorithm would be developed to remove these errors. Conclusion: An ISE-based, computer-controlled nutrient maintaining system would be a viable technique for improving accuracy and precision application of nutrient solutions in a plant factory crop production system...|$|R
