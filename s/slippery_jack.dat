5|$|Suillus americanus is {{a species}} of fungus in the Suillaceae family of mushrooms. Commonly known as the chicken fat mushroom, the American <b>slippery</b> <b>Jack</b> (or slipperycap), or the American suillus, it grows in a {{mycorrhizal}} association with eastern white pine {{and can be found}} where this tree occurs in eastern North America and China. The mushroom can be recognized by the bright yellow cap with red to reddish-brown scales embedded in slime, the large yellow angular pores {{on the underside of the}} cap, and the narrow yellow stem marked with dark reddish dots. Molecular phylogenetics analysis suggests that S.americanus may be the same species as S.sibiricus, found in western North America and western and central Asia. Suillus americanus is edible, although opinions vary as to its palatability; some susceptible individuals may suffer a contact dermatitis after touching the fruit bodies. The fruit bodies contain a beta glucan carbohydrate shown in laboratory tests to have anti-inflammatory properties.|$|E
5|$|Suillus luteus is a bolete fungus, and {{the type}} species of the genus Suillus. A common fungus native to Eurasia, from the British Isles to Korea, it has been {{introduced}} widely elsewhere, including North and South America, southern Africa, Australia and New Zealand. Commonly referred to as <b>slippery</b> <b>jack</b> or sticky bun in English-speaking countries, its names refer to the brown cap, which is characteristically slimy in wet conditions. The fungus, initially described as Boletus luteus by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, is now classified in a different family as well as genus. Suillus luteus is edible, though not as highly regarded as other bolete mushrooms, and is commonly prepared and eaten in soups, stews or fried dishes. The slime coating, however, may cause indigestion if not removed before eating.|$|E
5|$|Suillus luteus can {{be found}} all over the Northern Hemisphere. Native to Eurasia, it is {{widespread}} across the British Isles. To the east it has been recorded from Pakistan, where it was found along canals in Dashkin {{in the district of}} Astore, and as far east as South Korea. It has also been widely introduced elsewhere by way of pine plantations around the globe. It is very commonly found in Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) plantations, despite the tree being native to California and hence not in the fungus' native range. In North America it is found in the northeast, the Pacific Northwest and the southwestern United States. According to Ernst Both, it was Charles Horton Peck who first suggested in 1887 that the fungus was introduced to New York State on Pinus sylvestris. DNA studies show that the North American populations differ little genetically from European populations, supporting the idea that the fungus arrived to North America relatively recently as a result of human activity. Suillus luteus is found in coastal and mountainous pine forests and exhibits a tolerance of the northern latitudes. Southern Hemisphere locales where the <b>slippery</b> <b>jack</b> grow with plantation pines include South America, Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. In southwestern Australia, the bolete is limited to areas of greater than 1000mm (40in) annual rainfall. It has been recorded as far north as the Darling Downs and southern Queensland, and occasionally in Tasmania. The fungus fruits in spring, summer and fairly prolifically in autumn, following periods of wet weather. Mushrooms can appear in large troops or fairy rings.|$|E
500|$|<b>Slippery</b> <b>jacks</b> do {{not keep}} for long after picking, {{nor are they}} {{suitable}} for drying, as their water content is too high. They are suited for frying, or cooking in stews and soups, either alone or with other mushroom species. Puréeing the mushroom is not recommended, however: [...] "We once {{made the mistake of}} running it through a blender to make a soup. The result was a substance recommending itself for use when hanging wallpaper." [...] S.luteus and other Suillus species may cause allergic reactions in some people or digestive problems that appear to result from consuming the slimy skin. The fungus is better cooked before eating, and some authors recommend discarding the glutinous cuticle and tubes before cooking. Moreover, the skin can spoil other fungi with which <b>slippery</b> <b>jacks</b> are collected.|$|R
500|$|In Ecuador, Pinus radiata {{plantations}} {{were planted}} extensively around Cotopaxi National Park, and Suillus luteus boletes appear in abundance year-round. A 1985 field study estimated production to be 3000–6000 mushrooms per hectare—up to [...] (dry weight) of mushrooms hectare per year. This continuous production {{contrasts with the}} bolete's seasonal appearance elsewhere. The fungus is not found in adjacent areas of native vegetation. The fruiting is so bountiful that the harvest of <b>slippery</b> <b>jacks</b> has become the main reason that pine plantations are established or maintained in parts of Ecuador. In southern Brazil, it has been recorded in plantations of slash pine (P.elliottii) in the municipalities of Pelotas, Nova Petrópolis and Canela in Rio Grande do Sul, and Colombo in Paraná. It is particularly common in plantations in Patagonia. Suillus luteus is the commonest bolete encountered in the Falkland Islands, where it is found in windbreaks and gardens.|$|R
500|$|Suillus luteus is an edible mushroom. Although {{some authors}} {{regard it as}} one of low quality, and {{generally}} inferior to co-occurring species such as Boletus pinophilus, the species is considered a delicacy in Slavic cultures (known as maslyata in Russian or maślaki in Polish, deriving from words meaning [...] "buttery"). It was highly regarded in Calabria, even more than Boletus edulis, until the 1940s when increased interest in the latter species eclipsed the former. Mushrooms conforming to Suillus luteus are exported from Chile to Italy, and, since the 1970s, the United States. As of 2002, harvesters in Chile were paid on average US$0.5 per kilogram of fruit bodies. In Burundi, Suillus luteus mushrooms are sold to Europeans as cepes in Bujumbura but not generally eaten by the Barundi. Based on samples collected from Chile, the boletes contain (as a percentage of dry weight) 20% protein, 57% carbohydrates, 6% fat, and 6% ash. Pinus radiata plantations in southeastern Australia have become tourist attractions as people flock to them in autumn to pick <b>slippery</b> <b>jacks</b> and saffron milk-caps (Lactarius deliciosus); Belanglo State Forest in particular has attracted large numbers of Polish foragers.|$|R

Several authors have placed the <b>slippery</b> <b>jack</b> in other genera: Finnish mycologist Petter Karsten classified it as Cricunopus luteus in 1881—the genus Cricinopus defined by yellow adnate tubes; Lucien Quélet classified it as Viscipellis luteus in 1886, and Ixocomus luteus in 1888; and Paul Christoph Hennings placed it in the section Cricinopus of the genus Boletopsis in 1900.|$|E
