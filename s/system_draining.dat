2500|$|Small and {{harmless}} to humans, the Arabian carpetshark {{is one of}} the few shark species {{suitable for}} private aquaria. It is collected for the aquarium trade, which is not believed to pose a substantial threat to its population. The meat and possibly the fins of this shark can be used, but because of its size most individuals landed are discarded. It is captured incidentally in intertidal hadra (artisanal stake-net traps), as well as in demersal trammel and trawl nets. The Arabian carpetshark forms the predominant component of the [...] "cat shark" [...] catch of Kuwaiti prawn trawls, which represents the second-largest bycatch (14% of total) of the fishery. It is also caught off Bahrain and likely elsewhere. Another potentially major threat to this species is habitat degradation: coral reefs in the Persian Gulf face bottom trawling, coastal development (especially large-scale land reclamation projects such as in the United Arab Emirates), Turkish dams on the Tigris-Euphrates river <b>system,</b> <b>draining</b> of marshes in Iraq, and oil spills. Coastal habitats off India are also similarly pressured. As both fishing and habitat degradation are likely to intensify in the region, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the Arabian carpetshark as Near Threatened.|$|E

50|$|The Trench is drained by {{four major}} river basins: the Columbia, Fraser, Peace and Liard. Two {{reservoirs}} of the Columbia River Treaty fill {{much of its}} length today - Lake Koocanusa and Lake Kinbasket. A further British Columbia power initiative created Lake Williston. Rivers that follow the Trench, at least in part, are the Kootenay River, the Columbia River, the Canoe River, the Flathead River, the Fraser River, the Parsnip River, the Finlay River, the Fox River, and the Kechika River. The North Fork of the Flathead River, flowing into Flathead Lake with the other branches of the Flathead River, {{is part of the}} Columbia River system. The Kechika is part of the Liard River system, and the Fox, Parsnip and Finlay Rivers and part of the Peace River system. The Canoe River is a short tributary of the Columbia <b>system,</b> <b>draining</b> into Kinbasket Lake, a reservoir on the Columbia River. The Kootenai River, however, does not fully follow the Trench but exits Canada southwest via Lake Koocanusa reservoir to the Libby Dam. The Kootenay (Canadian spelling) River is a tributary of the Columbia, joining the Columbia at Castlegar, BC after a meander through the USA as the Kootenai River (US spelling).|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Recently {{obtained}} high-resolution seismic records, collect-ed offshore {{the western}} Netherlands in a kilometer-size grid across the lower shoreface and inner shelf, suggest {{the presence of}} a dense, pre-viously unknown network of tidal-channel fills in the shallow subsur-face of the North Sea. Seven channel fills constituting this network were analyzed in detail to infer relationships among the fills in time and space, and to identify factors governing channel development and tidal-basin evolution. The majority of the channels are oriented perpendic-ular to the coast, but parts of some have a strong coast-parallel com-ponent. Shell associations and sedimentological characteristics in most channel fills are typical of back-barrier depositional environments. All but one of the channel fills are part of an Atlantic-age tidal-channel <b>system,</b> <b>draining</b> a tidal basin protected by barrier islands. One chan-nel fill, which is correlated to an incision recognized onshore, repre-sents a younger phase in coastal development. The presumed barrier...|$|E

40|$|The Kuils River Catchment is {{an urban}} river {{catchment}} that forms {{part of the}} larger Kuils-Eerste River <b>system</b> <b>draining</b> the eastern half of the Cape Metropolitan Authority area and Stellenbosch Municipality. Rapid urbanisation has resulted in the encroachment of residential and industrial areas into the river system through channelization and sewage disposal. This research project intends to assess the quality of surface runoff in the Kuils River catchment and determining non-point source pollutant loading rates in the catchment using GIS-based modelling. The study results show how modelled potential sources of surface runoff and NPS pollutants using desktop GIS analysis tools in a sequential process that involved different levels of software applications could explain the characteristics of the catchment. With the help of the Expected Mean Concentration (EMC) values associated with surface runoff from land use/covers, NPS pollutant loads were assessed downstream towards the Kuils River Catchment outlet using the Nonpoint Source Pollution and Erosion Comparison Tool (N-SPECT) based in ArcGIS.

40|$|Fragmentation loads, {{the loads}} under which {{individual}} particles fragment between plattens, were measured for quartz from weathered samples of a granite and from points along a stream <b>system</b> <b>draining</b> the granite surface. Stream transportation caused major destruction of 2 - 5 mm quartz {{in a few}} kilometers. 1 - 2 mm particles were less affected and breakage of 0. 5 - 1. 0 mm quartz was more than compensated by production of new grains created by breakage of coarser ones. Most breakage probably occurs in the bedload zone during floods, particularly {{in the presence of}} mov-ing pebbles. Greater mobility enables small grains to outlast larger, stronger ones in this environment. Not only are small grains more easily kept above the breakage zone in suspension but they are probably much more readily moved away from impending impact points between pebbles by momentary radiating currents generated around such points just before the pebbles impact. Downstream fining of river sediments is due to both hydraulic separation and breakage. The latter is very important in headwater regions but its effectiveness probably wanes downstream in large rivers...|$|E
