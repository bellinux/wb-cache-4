40|$|Background: Fixed {{sagittal}} imbalance (a syndrome {{in which}} the patient is only able to stand with the weight-bearing line {{in front of the}} sacrum) has many etiologies. The most commonly reported technique for correction is the Smith-Petersen osteotomy. Few reports on pedicle subtraction procedures (resection of the posterior elements, pedicles, and vertebral body through a posterior approach) are available in the peer-reviewed literature. We are aware of no re-port involving a substantial number of patients with coexistent scoliosis who underwent pedicle/vertebral body sub-traction for the treatment of fixed sagittal imbalance. Methods: Twenty-seven consecutive patients in whom sagittal imbalance was treated with lumbar pedicle subtraction osteotomy at one institution were analyzed. Radiographic analysis included assessment of thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis, lordosis through the pedicle subtraction osteotomy site, and the C 7 <b>sagittal</b> plumb <b>line.</b> Outcomes analysis was performed with use of a before-and-after pain scale, items from the Oswestry questionnaire, and the Scoliosis Research Society (SRS) questionnaire after a minimum duration of follow-up of two years. Complications and radio-graphic findings were also analyzed for the entire group. Results: Overall, the average increase in lordosis was 34. 1 ° and the average improvement in the <b>sagittal</b> plumb <b>line</b> was 13. 5 cm. One patient had development of a lumbar pseudarthrosis through the area of pedicle subtraction os-teotomy, and six patients had development of a thoracic pseudarthrosis.

30|$|For closed injuries, {{we proceed}} to {{definitive}} management when {{the soft tissue}} swelling has settled (often 7 – 14  days). During this waiting period, a CT scan is performed to plan the procedure. Based on the CT, an approach is made directly onto the primary <b>sagittal</b> fracture <b>line,</b> minimising soft tissue stripping and maintaining full thickness skin flaps. The articular surface is visualised and the impacted fragments reduced under direct vision. Reconstruction of the plafond proceeds from posterior to anterior with temporary k-wires used to hold the articular reduction, and small fragment screws (cannulated and partially threaded) then applied to secure definitive stability.|$|R

These measurements were done to see if there were any correlations with the severity of the degenerative cervical changes.|$|R
5000|$|In {{medicine}} and occupations concerned with physical fitness, {{the concept of}} good posture {{is referred to as}} [...] "neutral spine." [...] In this context, proper posture or [...] "neutral spine," [...] is the proper alignment of the body between postural extremes. Deviations from neutral alignment are identified as excessive curvature or reduction in curvature. Rarely do these deviations in curvature occur in only one plane; however, they are typically referred to in this manner. In the anterior/posterior view, deviation from vertical results in abnormal lateral curvature of the spine called scoliosis. In the sagittal view, excessive curvature in the cervical region is cervical lordosis, in the thoracic region thoracic kyphosis, and in the lumbar region lumbar lordosis. Reduction in curvature is typically termed flat back if present in the thoracic region and lumbar kyphosis if present in the lumbar region. In posture analysis, the spine is compared to a plumb line to detect the aforementioned abnormalities. From the anterior/posterior view this plumb line should run vertically down the midline of the body dividing it symmetrically into right and left halves indicating even weight distribution on left and right sides. From the sagittal view the plumb line should bisect the ear, odontoid process of C2, the cervical vertebral bodies, the center of the glenohumeral joint, the lumbar vertebral bodies, the center of the acetabulum, just posterior to the patella, and through the tarsals of the feet. This <b>sagittal</b> <b>line</b> of reference theoretically indicates even distribution of weight between the front and the back of the body.|$|E

40|$|Measurement of the {{abduction}} {{angle of the}} lower limbs is based on trigonometry. An isosceles triangle is generated from that movement, and anatomic reference values are measured. The newborn is undressed except for a diaper and {{is placed in the}} dorsal decubitus position on the examina-tion table, with the buttocks and lower limbs positioned on the clipboard that was previously wrapped with weigh-ing paper. The newborn must be alert and not crying. One examiner maintains proper alignment of the newborn, with the lower limbs extended, the pelvis stabilized, and the head centralized (with help from the child’s mother if necessary) (Figure 1 and Figure 2). From this starting position, the other examiner marks the paper on the clip-board with a pen to indicate a focal point on the <b>sagittal</b> <b>line</b> {{at the level of the}} medial malleolus (Figure 1 A). The examiner then proceeds with {{the abduction}}, marking the new position of the medial malleolus on the paper. Then, the diaper is opened to expose the pelvis and abdomen. The limbs are returned to the <b>sagittal</b> <b>line,</b> and the dis-tance between the medial malleolus and the anterior superior iliac spine or umbilical scar is measured using the metric ribbon, as shown in Figure 2. Each limb is measured independently. After a measurement is obtained, a triangle is drawn on the clipboard (without the neonate) (Figure 1 B). Measurement of the inferential abduction angle from the isosceles triangle is obtained by plotting the height, gener-ating 2 equal straight triangles. The sine is calculated by dividing the opposite side of the angle by the hypotenuse. Goniometry is a commonly used method to meas-ure articular arc movement, particularly relativeto range of movement and muscle tone. 1 - 3 To date, there is no appropriate goniometer for use in newborns.

The wires were driven through the subchondral bone from lateral to medial perpendicular to {{the fracture}}. One wire was used as a joystick to hold the fragment reduced, while the other wire driven across the fracture. This was technically easy for joint depression type fractures but, for tongue types, the posterior end of the tongue fragment had to be held in a reduced position with the tuberosity fragment using a large AO bone-reduction forceps. Since the posterior facet of calcaneus is convex upward, it was difficult to visualize the most medial portion of the facet from a small lateral approach. However, after reduction and temporary fixation, the posterior subtalar joint was assessed for congruity and accuracy of reduction through intra-operative Broden’s views.|$|R

Optic fibre probes were used as optical head of a novel, highly sensitive near infrared continuous wave spectroscopy (CW-NIR) instrument. This prototype was designed for non-invasive analysis of the two main forms of haemoglobin: oxy-haemoglobin (HbO 2) and deoxy-haemoglobin (Hb), chromophores present in biological tissues. It was tested in peripheral tissue (human gastrocnemius muscle) and then reset to perform measurement on rat brain. In animal studies, the optical head was firmly placed using stereotaxic apparatus upon the <b>sagittal</b> <b>line</b> of anaesthetised adult rat's head, without any surgery. Then pharmacological treatments with saline (300 µl s. c.) amphetamine (2 mg/kg) or nicotine (0. 4 mg/kg) were performed.

40|$|It {{is a broad}} {{consensus}} {{today that}} scoliosis curves cannot be improved through bracing, and the Scoliosis Research Society (SRS) methodological criteria for bracing have the avoidance of progression as their only objective. Consequently, in curves more than 45 °, fusion is considered as basically the only possible treatment. The {{purpose of the study}} was to verify in a series of patients who utterly refused surgery if it was possible to achieve improvements of scoliosis of more than 45 ° through a complete conservative treatment (bracing and exercises). Retrospective cohort from a prospective database. Out of 1, 148 idiopathic scoliosis (IS) patients at the end of treatment, the sample comprised 28 subjects older than 10 years, still growing, with at least one curve above 45 °, who had continually refused fusion. The group comprised 24 females and four males, including 14 in which previous brace treatments had failed; at the start of treatment, the age was 14. 2 ± 1. 8 years and Cobb degrees in the curve were 49. 4 ° (range, 45 °- 58 °). Subgroups considered were gender, bone age, type of scoliosis, treatment used, and previous failed treatment. Self-report measurement: SRS- 22; physiological measures: Cobb degrees, Bunnell angle of trunk rotation (ATR), aesthetic index (AI), and <b>sagittal</b> plumb <b>line</b> distances. The methods comprised full-time treatment (23 or 24 hours per day) for 1 year with Risser cast, Lyon, or Sforzesco brace; weaning of 1 to 2 hours every 6 months; with strategies to maximize compliance through the Society on Scoliosis Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Treatment (SOSORT) management criteria applied and specific scientific exercises approach to scoliosis exercises (SEAS) performed. Reported compliance in the 4. 10 ± 1. 2 treatment years was 94 %, with satisfaction regarding treatment and excellent results at the SRS- 22. Two patients (7 %) remained above 50 ° Cobb but six patients (21 %) finished between 30 ° and 35 ° Cobb and 12 patients (43 %) finished between 36 ° and 40 ° Cobb.

The hand was hidden by a mirror in which they saw the lines projected from a computer screen. In normal trials, the line seen in the mirror exactly corresponded to the traced line. In perturbed trials, a bias was introduced by the computer, so that the line appeared to deviate in one direction (right or left) by a variable angle (2, 5, 7 or 10 degrees). Subjects consistently displaced their hand {{in the opposite direction}} for producing a visually <b>sagittal</b> <b>line.</b> After each trial, they were asked in which direction they thought their hand had moved.

In addition, a post-hoc analysis revealed that one group of subjects misperceived the direction of their hand movement in the direction opposite to the perturbation (Group 1, including 9 Ss), whereas the other group gave responses in the correct direction (Group 2, including 4 Ss). In a second session using the same experimental paradigm, a motor response was asked for: subjects had to indicate the perceived direction of their hand during each trial by drawing a line with their eyes closed.

Subjects had to trace a <b>sagittal</b> <b>line</b> with a stylus on a graphic tablet. The hand was hidden by a mirror on which the traced line, processed by a computer, was projected. Without informing the subjects, the line traced was modified by introducing a bias to the right, which increased progressively from 2 degrees to 42 degrees. To succeed the task, subjects had to modify their motor program and deviate their hand in the opposite direction. The sensory-motor adjustment to the bias was evaluated by the surface between the line traced and the ideal line to compensate for the deviation. The awareness of the conflict was measured by the angle of the bias at which subjects expressed the feeling that the line they traced was not the same as the line they saw. The deviation was similarly compensated for by patients and controls until 24 degrees. Then 14 controls but only 3 patients were aware of a conflict. After that, the variability of performance increased significantly for the unaware patients.

40|$|We {{report on}} 31 cases of calcaneal {{fractures}} studied with CT {{according to the}} latest classification by the Italian Surgical Society of the Foot. Of the utmost importance is the radiologic assessment of the posterior facet and of the underlying bone, which make up the so-called talamus which bears most of the body weight. In our series, talamus fractures were the most frequent ones (26 / 31 cases) : they are characterized by a main <b>sagittal</b> <b>line,</b> running obliquely and dividing the posterior surface and the bone into an anteromedial, or substentacular, fragment and aposterolateral, or tuberosity, fragment. According to fracture severity, the first differential criterion is the presence/absence of displacement and depression (type I fractures the latter, 6 cases in our series, and types II and III the former, 20 / 26 cases in our series). Based on the degree of displacement and depression, fractures as classified as type II (10 / 26 cases) when only the lateral portion of the talamus is displaced and depressed, or as type III (10 / 26 cases) when the whole talamus is fragmented, displaced and depressed. Moreover, other worsening factors must be considered and B subgroups differentiated in types II and III fractures; these factors are: calcaneus-cuboid facet involvement, lateral wall fragmentation, posterior facet comminution. a small sustentacular fragment and a secondary frontal fracture interrupting the plantar cortex. Extra-talamic fractures, defined as such when isolated, rarely occur. Relative to the anterior apophysis, radiologic attention must be focused on fractures of the dorsal prominence, or beak, which are very often misdiagnosed. As regards the posterior tuberosity, its lateral dislocation must be studied because it may account for calcaneofibular impingement. CT exhibits excellent potentials, provided that slices are thin, acquired on the axial and coronal planes and that, as far as possible, sagittal reconstructions are used, the latter being very useful to depict talamic surface...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground contextIt has {{previously}} been shown that rotational stability of spinal segments is reduced by posteriorly directed shear loads that {{are the result of}} gravity and muscle tone. Posterior shear loads act on those segments of the spine that are posteriorly inclined, as determined by each individual's inherited sagittal spinal profile. Accordingly, it can be inferred that certain sagittal spinal profiles are more prone to develop a rotational deformity that may lead to idiopathic scoliosis; and lumbar scoliosis, {{on one end of the}} spectrum, develops from a different sagittal spinal profile than thoracic scoliosis on the other end. PurposeTo examine the role of sagittal spinopelvic alignment in the etiopathogenesis of different types of idiopathic scoliosis. Study design/settingMulticenter retrospective analysis of lateral radiographs of patients with small thoracic and lumbar adolescent idiopathic scoliotic curves. Patients sampleWe included 192 adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients with either a thoracic (n= 128) or lumbar (n= 64) structural curve with a Cobb angle of less than 20 ° were studied. Children with other spinal pathology or with more severe idiopathic scoliosis were excluded, because this disturbs their original sagittal profile. Subjects who underwent scoliosis screening and had a normal spine were included in the control cohort (n= 95). Outcome measuresThoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis, T 9 sagittal offset, C 7 and T 4 <b>sagittal</b> plumb <b>lines,</b> pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt, and sacral slope, as well as parameters describing orientation in space of each individual vertebra between C 7 and L 5 and length of the posteriorly inclined segment. MethodsOn standardized lateral radiographs of the spine, a systematic, semi-automatic measurement of the different sagittal spinopelvic parameters was performed for each subject using in-house developed computer software. ResultsEarly thoracic scoliosis showed a significantly different sagittal plane from lumbar scoliosis. Furthermore, both scoliotic curve patterns were different from controls, but in a different sense. Thoracic kyphosis was significantly decreased in thoracic scoliosis compared with both lumbar scoliosis patients and controls. For thoracic scoliosis, a significantly longer posteriorly inclined segment, and steeper posterior inclination of C 7 –T 8 was observed compared with both lumbar scoliosis and controls. In lumbar scoliosis, the posteriorly inclined segment was shorter and located lower in the spine, and T 12 –L 4 was more posteriorly inclined than in the thoracic group. The lumbar scoliosis cohort had a posteriorly inclined segment of the same length as controls, but T 12 –L 2 showed steeper posterior inclination. Lumbar lordosis, pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt, and sacral slope, however, were similar for the two scoliotic subgroups as well as the controls. ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that even at an early stage in the condition, the sagittal profile of thoracic adolescent idiopathic scoliosis differs significantly from lumbar scoliosis, and both types of scoliosis differ from controls, but in different aspects. This supports the theory that differences in underlying sagittal profile play a role in the development of different types of idiopathic scoliosis...|$|R
40|$|Radiographic {{sagittal}} plane analysis of VATS (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery) anterior instrumentation for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. This is retrospective study. To report, in details about effects of VATS anterior instrumentation on the {{sagittal plane}}. Evaluations of the surgical outcome of scoliosis have primarily studied in coronal plane correction, functional, and cosmetic aspects. Sagittal balance, {{as well as}} coronal balance, is important in functional spine. Recently, scoliosis surgery applying VATS has been increasingly performed. Its outcome has been reported several times; however, according to our search of the literature, the only one study partially mentioned. The study population was a total of 42 cases of idiopathic scoliosis patients (8 male, 34 female). Their mean age was 15. 6 years (13 to 18 years). The 18 cases were Lenke IA type, 16 cases were Lenke IB type, and 8 cases were Lenke IC type. The preoperative Cobb's angle was 54. 5 ± 13. 9 °. All patients were followed up {{for a minimum of}} 2 years and implanted, on average, at the 5. 9 level (5 to 8 levels). The most proximal implant was the 4 th thoracic spine, and the most distal implant was the 1 st lumbar spine. Whole spine standing PA and lateral radiographs were taken before surgery, 2 months after surgery, and at the last follow up (range 24 - 48 months, mean 35 months). The C 7 plumbline proximal junctional measurement (PJM), distal junctional measurement (DJM), thoracic kyphosis, and lumbar lordosis angles were measured and compared. In all cases, follow-ups were possible and survived till the last follow up. The Cobb's angle in coronal plane at the last follow up was 19. 7 ± 9. 3 ° and was corrected to 63. 8 % on average. The preoperative C 7 sagittal plumbline before surgery was - 13. 9 ± 29. 1 mm, the final follow up was - 9. 9 ± 23. 8 mm, and the average positive displacement was 4 mm. Thoracic kyphosis was increased from preoperative 18. 2 ± 7. 7 ° to 22. 4 ± 7. 2 ° on average at the last follow up, and the increase was, on average, 4. 2 °. The PJM angel was increased from 6. 2 ± 4. 3 ° preoperative to 8. 8 ± 3. 7 ° at the last follow up, and the increment was, on the average, 2. 6 °. The DJM angle before surgery was 6. 8 ± 5. 1 ° and 6. 7 ± 4 ° at the last follow up, and did not change noticeably. Preoperative lumbar lordosis was 42 ± 10. 7 ° and 43. 5 ± 11. 1 ° after surgery. Similarly, it did not change greatly. The scoliosis surgery applying VATS displaced the C 7 <b>sagittal</b> plumb <b>line</b> by 4 mm to the anteriorly, increased thoracic kyphosis by 4. 2 °, and increased PJM by 2. 6 °. DJM and lumbar lordosis, before and after operation, were not significantly different. Although the surgical technique of VATS thoracic instrumentation is difficult to make the normal thoracic kyphosis, an acceptable sagittal balance can be obtained in Lenke type I adolescent idiopathic scoliosis using VATS...|$|R
40|$|Study Design. Prospective {{radiographic}} study. Objective. To {{investigate the}} feasibility of controlling quality of reconstructed sagittal balance for sagittal imbalance. Summary of Background Data. Patients with sagittal imbalance cannot walk or stand erect without overwork of musculature because of compromised biomechanical advantage. The result is muscle fatigue and activity-related pain. During reconstructive surgery, restoration of optimal sagittal balance is crucial for obtaining satisfactory clinical results. However, {{there is no way}} to control quality of reconstructed sagittal balance before or during surgery. Methods. A method was developed to determine the lumbosacral curve in a way that theoretically would bring sagittal balance to an ideal state by calculation and simulation for each patient before surgery and then template rods of the curve and a blueprint were made accordingly for operative procedures. Ninety-four consecutive patients with sagittal imbalance due to lumbar kyphosis were treated for intractable pain and then followed up for a mean of 4. 3 years. Radiographs were analyzed before surgery, 2 months after surgery, and at most recent follow-up. Results. The mean estimated values of L 1 -S 1 lordosis, sacral inclination angle, sacrofemoral distance, and distribution of L 1 -S 1 lordosis at the closing-opening wedge osteotomy site and L 4 -S 1 segments were - 30. 8 degrees, 24. 6 degrees, 0 mm, 16. 1 % (- 5 degrees), and 62 % (- 19 degrees), respectively. The mean reconstructed values were - 41. 1 degrees, 23. 3 degrees, 3. 9 mm, 41 % (- 17 degrees), and 46 % (- 19 degrees), respectively. There were significant differences between estimated and reconstructed values of L 1 -S 1 lordosis and the percentage of distributions; however, there was no significant difference between the estimated and reconstructed magnitude of L 4 -S 1 lordosis, sacral inclination angle, and sacrofemoral distance. A properly oriented pelvis can be brought nearly directly above the hip axis. The mean sagittal global balance, represented by the distance between the vertical line through the hip axis and sacral promontory, improved from 61. 4 mm before surgery to 3. 9 mm 2 months after surgery, and 1. 3 mm at final follow-up. Normal sagittal global balance was reconstructed and maintained. The mean sagittal spinal balance measured as the horizontal distance between the C 7 <b>sagittal</b> plumb <b>line</b> and the posterior superior corner of S 1 improved from 97. 4 mm before surgery to 11 mm 2 months after surgery. However, there was significant loss of sagittal spinal balance to 25. 4 mm at the final visit. Normal sagittal spinal balance was reconstructed and appeared to be maintained. The magnitude of T 1 -T 12 kyphosis compensated from 13 degrees before surgery to 25. 2 degrees 2 months after surgery and 34. 5 degrees at final follow-up. Conclusions. Quality control of the reconstructed sagittal balance for sagittal imbalance is possible. Correctly orienting the pelvis, reconstructed by the restoration of enough L 1 -S 1 lordosis with adequate distribution at L 4 -S 1 segments, is a matter of critical importance for optimizing reconstructed sagittal balance. The correctly oriented pelvis can be determined before surgery. Preventing junctional fracture and persistent rehabilitation of surgically injured lumbar extensor musculature are crucial for maintaining the reconstructed sagittal balance...|$|R

40|$|Kyphotic {{deformity}} {{can produce}} sagittal malalignment and imbalance. Patients {{can not move}} or stand erect without overwork of musculature because of compromising the biomechanical advantage. The result is muscle fatigue and activity-related pain. During reconstructive surgery, restoration of the best possible sagittal balance is crucial for obtaining satisfactory clinical results. However, there are two problems for this. The first, {{there is no way}} to control and predict the quality or outcomes of the reconstructed sagittal balance before or during operation. The second, there is no an osteotomy through posterior-only approach for the large and rigid kyphosis to allow three-column release and large range of correction. A method was developed to determine the lumbosacral curve which theoretically would bring spinal sagittal balance to an ideal state by calculation and simulation for each patient preoperatively and a template and blueprint was made accordingly for operative procedures to follow. Also a new osteotomy, closing-opening wedge osteotomy(COWO), to provide three-column release through a posterior-only approach was developed and could make rigid kyphotic deformity flexible enough to be adequately manipulated to match the template and to obtain optimal correction of sagittal imbalance. 	The objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of controlling quality of reconstructed sagittal balance for sagittal imbalance and to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the new method and surgical procedures to reconstruct an optimal sagittal balance for patients with sagittal imbalance or kyphotic deformity. 	The report contained two studies. In study 1, thirty-one patients with degenerative lumbar kyphoscoliosis (mean age, 72. 3 years; range, 65 - 78 years) treated with the method and COWO were followed up for a mean of 4. 1 years. Their preoperative, 2 -month postoperative, and final follow-up radiographs were assessed and a questionnaire to measure changes in pain, function, self-image, patient satisfaction with surgery administered was. Postoperative complications was analyzed. In study 2, eighty-three consecutive patients treated for sagittal imbalance with the method and COWO with a minimum follow-up of two years were analyzed. Radiographic analysis included assessment of thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis, lordosis through COWO site, and sagittal balance. Outcomes analysis utilized the Scoliosis Research Society questionnaire. Complications and radiographic findings were analyzed. 	In study 1, final radiographs showed increased L 1 -S 1 lordosis from 11. 3 ° to - 50. 5 ° (increase of 61. 8 °), correction of kyphotic deformity from 64. 3 ° to - 14. 1 °, and correction of scoliotic deformity from 48. 9 ° to 8. 3 °. Sagittal imbalance significantly improved from 68. 8 to 27. 1 mm, whereas the sacrofemoral distance decreased from 59. 3 to - 5. 1 mm, and the sacral inclination angle increased from 9. 7 ° to 34. 3 °. Subjective pain was significantly and persistently reduced. Most patients maintained good correction and had good clinical results. No major complication occurred. Eight patients (26 %) developed junctional kyphosis. In study 2, the average increased in lordosis and improved sagittal balance were 81. 9 o and 17. 1 cm. Mean correction through the osteotomy site was 42. 2 o (range 31 - 55 o). No vascular injury occurred. While three patients developed lumbosacral pseudarthrosis, the COWO area was unaffected in all patients. Nine patients developed cephalad junctional kyphosis and two patients developed caudad junctional kyphosis. Most patients reported improvement in terms of pain, self-image, and function as well as overall satisfaction with the procedure. 	Analysis of all radiographic datas showed the mean estimated values of L 1 -S 1 lordosis, sacral inclination angle (SIA), sacrofemoral distance (SFD), and distribution of L 1 -S 1 lordosis at the closing-opening wedge osteotomy (COWO) site and L 4 -S 1 segments were - 30. 8 o, 24. 6 o, 0 mm, 16. 1 % (- 5 o), and 62 % (- 19 o), respectively. The mean reconstructed values were - 41. 1 o, 23. 3 o, 3. 9 mm, 41 % (- 17 o), and 46 % (- 19 o), respectively. There were significant differences between estimated and reconstructed values of L 1 -S 1 lordosis and percent of distributions, however, there was no significant difference between the estimated and reconstructed magnitude of L 4 -S 1 lordosis, SIA, and SFD. A properly oriented pelvis can be brought nearly directly above the hip axis. The mean sagittal global balance, represented by the distance between the vertical line through the hip axis and sacral promontory, improved from 61. 4 mm before surgery to 3. 9 mm 2 months after surgery. Normal sagittal global balance was reconstructed. The mean sagittal spinal balance measured as the horizontal distance between the C 7 <b>sagittal</b> plumb <b>line</b> and the posterior superior corner of S 1 improved from 97. 4 mm before surgery to 11 mm 2 months after surgery. Normal sagittal spinal balance was reconstructed. 	Quality control of the reconstructed sagittal balance for sagittal imbalance is possible. Correctly orienting the pelvis reconstructed by restoration of enough L 1 -S 1 lordosis with adequate distribution at L 4 -S 1 segments is a matter of critical importance for optimizing reconstructed sagittal balance. Preventing junctional fracture and persistent rehabilitation of surgically injured lumbar extensor musculature are crucial for maintaining the reconstructed sagittal balance. COWO is a safe and useful procedure for patients with sagittal imbalance the level of patient satisfaction was high after more than two years of follow-up, with most patients having improved resolution of pain, increased self-image, and greater function. A worse clinical result is associated with increasing patient comorbidities, pseudarthrosis in lumbosacral fusion, and junctional kyphosis. 駝背畸型會造成脊椎矢狀面排列不正及失衡，病患喪失生物力學的優勢而必需過度使用肌力以維持行動及站立，結果導致肌肉疲憊及疼痛，在重建手術中回復良好的矢狀面平衡，對獲得令人滿意的臨床結果而言是至關重要的，可是，目前有二大困難，其一是無法在手術前預測或手術中控制所重建矢狀面平衡的結果與品質，其二是沒有一種截骨術可經由後路單一路徑，針對大而堅硬的駝背畸型提供脊椎三柱鬆解及大幅度的矯正。 本研究設計出一種方法，可在手術前藉由計算及模擬出理論上可帶動脊椎並達到理想矢狀面平衡的腰薦椎曲線，並製作成模型及手術藍圖以供手術遵循，並研發一種新的截骨術，即開合式截骨術，可經由後路提供脊椎三柱鬆解，可使堅硬的駝背畸型得到足夠的柔軟度以便操控脊椎排列以符合模型曲線而達到脊椎失衡的良好矯正。 研究的目的是要評估在臨床上使用這個方法及手術步驟治療駝背畸型及矢狀面失衡以重建良好矢狀面平衡的安全性及有效性。 以二組病患群為研究材料。第一組： 31 例腰椎駝背側彎病患，平均年齡 72. 3 歲(65 － 78 歲) ，因難以忍受的疼痛接受前上述方法治療，平均追蹤 4. 1 年，以術前，術後二個月，及最終隨訪之X光片，問卷及併發症進行評估探討。第二組： 83 例因矢狀面失衡或駝背畸型以前述方法治療的病患進行分析，所有病例追蹤期最少二年，放射線學分析包括胸椎駝背角度，腰椎前曲角度，開合截骨節段之前曲角，及脊椎矢狀面平衡，結果分析是根據SRS問卷，併發症及放射線學數據。 研究結果兩組病患x光資料分析顯示第一組病患最終隨訪的x光片顯示腰 1 至薦 1 前曲角度由後凸 11. 3 度矯正至前曲 50. 5 度(矯正 61. 8 度) ，後凸畸型由 64. 3 度矯正至前曲 14. 1 度，側凸畸型由 48. 9 度矯正至 8. 3 度，矢狀面平衡由 68. 8 ㎜，矯正至 27. 1 ㎜，薦股距(sacrofemoral distance) 由 59. 3 ㎜減至- 5. 1 ㎜，薦椎傾斜角度(sacral inclination angle) 由 9. 7 度增至 34. 3 度，疼痛感明顯及持續的減輕，大部份病例都可維持良好的矯正及臨床結果，沒有大的併發症發生，有 8 例(26 %) 的病例發生交界後凸(junctional kyphosis) 。第二組病患最終隨訪的x光片顯示，平均前曲角度之增加為 81. 9 度，矢狀面平衡改善 17. 1 公分，截骨節段平均矯正度為 42. 2 度(範圍： 31 ~ 55 度) ，沒有血管損傷發生，在截骨節段沒有假關節形成，有三例在腰薦節段有假關節形成，有 11 例產生交界處駝背畸型，大部分的病患在疼痛，自體形象感，功能及滿意度均改善。 分析兩組病患x光資料顯示，術前預估第一腰椎與第一薦椎之腰椎前曲角，薦椎前傾角，薦椎股骨間距，截骨部份角度及佔比，第四腰椎與第一薦椎間之前曲角及佔比分別為- 30. 8 度、 24. 6 度、 0 毫米、 16. 1 %(- 5 度) 和 62 %(- 19 度) 。重建值分別為- 41. 1 度、 23. 3 度、 3. 9 毫米、 41 %(- 17 度) 及 46 %(- 19 度) 。第一腰椎與第一薦椎前曲角度及部位佔率值之預估值和重建值有意義的差異，而第四腰椎與第一薦值前曲角度，薦椎前傾角度和薦椎股骨間距均無有意義的差異，一個適當前傾的骨盆可被矯正到股骨軸的正上方，平均整體矢狀面平衡由術前 61. 4 mm矯正至術後二個月的 3. 9 mm。重建了正常的整體矢狀面平衡，平均矢狀面脊椎平衡由術前 97. 4 mm矯正至術後二個月 11 mm，重建了正常的矢狀面脊椎平衡。 研究結論證明重建矢狀面平衡的品質控管是可行的，其關鍵在於重建足夠的第一腰椎與第一薦椎間前曲度及適當的分配第四腰椎與第一薦椎間前曲角以重建正確的骨盆前傾，預防交界骨折及持續復健腰伸肌對於維持矢狀面平衡是至關重要的。開合式截骨矯正術治療腰椎駝背畸型導致矢狀面失衡是一安全有效的方法。CHAPTER 1 	 INTRODUCTION	 1 1. 1 	INTRODUCTION TO SAGITTAL BALANCE AND ALIGNMENT	 1 1. 2 	INTRODUCTION TO OSTEOTOMY	 4 1. 2. 1 	Introduction to Opening Wedge Osteotomy	 4 1. 2. 2 	Introduction to Closing Wedge Osteotomy	 5 1. 3 	PROBLEM STATEMENT	 6 1. 4 	OBJECTIVE	 6 CHAPTER 2 	 FUNDAMENTAL KNOWLEDGE	 8 2. 1 	SAGITTAL IMBALANCE	 8 2. 2 	PELVIC MORPHOLOGY AND SAGITTAL ALIGNMENT CORRELATIONS	 9 2. 3 	CENTER OF GRAVITY LINE AND C 7 PLUMB LINE 	 11 2. 4 	LEGAYE EQUATION 	 12 2. 5 	SAGITTAL ALIGNMENT DISTRIBUTION	 12 2. 6 	HINGE OF CORRECTION	 13 CHAPTER 3 	THE TEMPLATE AND BLUEPRINT, THE NEW OSTEOTOMY 	 15 3. 1 	MAKING TEMPLATE AND BLUEPRINT FOR SURGERY	 15 3. 1. 1 	Identify the ideal <b>sagittal</b> balance <b>line</b> for <b>sagittal</b> imbalance	 15 3. 1. 2 	Determine pelvic orientation	 16 3. 1. 3 	Determine lumbosacral lordosis	 18 3. 1. 4 	Determine the lumbosacral curve that can bring promontory directly above the center of gravity	 18 3. 1. 5 	Make template and blueprint for reconstruction of optimal sagittal balance	 19 3. 2 	OSTEOTOMY DESIGN	 20 3. 2. 1 	Closing-opening Wedge Osteotomy 	 20 3. 2. 2 	Biomechanical analysis 	 21 CHAPTER 4 	 CLINICAL STUDIES	 24 4. 1 	CLINICAL STUDY 1 : SURGICAL TREATMENT OF DEGENERATIVE LUMBAR KYPHOSCOLIOSIS (DLKS) 	 24 4. 1. 1 	Materials	 24 4. 1. 2 	Methods of evaluation	 24 4. 1. 2. 1.
