Seedling plots were censused in March, 2008 {{and a total of}} 2, 632 seedlings were recorded. Multiple linear regression was used to analyze the relationship between the abundance of seedlings for nine species and six variables, including the number of conspecifics within 10 m away from a <b>seed</b> <b>trap,</b> the sum of conspecific basal area within 10 m away from a <b>seed</b> <b>trap,</b> and convexity, slope, aspect, and elevation. Factors influencing seedling abundance differed among species. Three species were related only to topographic variables, one species was related only to the conspecifc variables, four species were influenced by both topography and conspecific abundance, and one species was influenced by neither. For all species except Memecylon ligustrifolium, significant partial regression coefficients were positive, indicating that seedling abundance increases with the number or the basal area of conspecifics within 10 m away from a <b>seed</b> <b>trap.</b> This research provides indirect evidence for dispersal limitation and niche theory...|$|E

40|$|Bison-mediated seed {{dispersal}} {{may be a}} critical ecological process that has been eliminated in grassland ecosystems by the removal of this keystone species. In this study of epizoochory and endozoochory by bison, we installed funnel seed traps on 50, 50 -m transects on the Neal Smith National Wildlife Refuge in south central Iowa, to compare the composition and density of seed species dispersed by bison with the abiotic seed rain in a tallgrass prairie reconstruction. <b>Seed</b> <b>trap,</b> dung, and shed hair samples were collected monthly from April 2011 through November 2013. Hair samples were clipped directly from bison {{at the end of}} the plant growing season during annual November round-ups. Seeds were identified and classified as native or non-native, by plant functional group, and by diaspore characteristics. A diverse mix of epizoochorus seeds, wind dispersed propagules, and seeds with smooth, rounded diaspores in bison dung, shed hair, and attached to the animals, suggests that bison are generalist dispersers of both forbs and graminoids. Bison dung contained seeds in similar proportions to those collected in seed traps. Shed bison hair contained a significantly greater proportion of both native species and grass seeds than were found in bison dung or <b>seed</b> <b>trap</b> samples. Seed compositions in shed hair and dung appeared to be influenced by the phenology of seed production, the foraging behavior of bison, and the movements of bison through a variety of vegetation types. Bison are the dominant grazers in many large public and private grasslands of western North America. Conservation herds are growing and are being reintroduced to both newly reconstructed prairies and remnant prairies that have been without this keystone species for over a century.

Every 10  m along each transect I placed a cloth <b>seed</b> <b>trap</b> of 1  m 2 collecting area and 0.5  m depth, {{for a total of}} 5 traps per forest.

The traps were constructed with 5  cm 2 wire mesh on top, cloth underneath for collecting the seeds, and suspended on 1  m plastic poles for keeping the traps off the ground to reduce predation. This design has proven effective in several past Neotropic seed rain studies (e.g., Myster 2004; Myster 2007 b) and predation is very rare for seed traps of this size (Muller-Landau et. al. 2008). No seed traps were flooded during the sample period.|$|E
40|$|Several {{methods are}} used for {{studying}} seed dispersal (seed traps, tracking individual seeds, tracking seeds coloured by fluorescent colours, etc.) However, only a few studies compared results obtained by several methods. In {{first part of this}} master thesis, I compared the three above mentioned methods used for studying seed dispersal using species from Asteraceae family. From previous research within the study area (Úštěcko), it is known that dry grassland species are able to colonize abandoned fields. Using seed dispersal data obtained within this theses, I tried to assess the role of seed dispersal on distribution of dry grassland species on abandoned fields both on local and regional scale. The results showed that dispersal curves obtained by the three methods differ significantly. This results may be due to different wind conditions during the experiments. <b>Seed</b> <b>trap</b> data show results from long-term seed dispersal influenced by highly variable wind conditions.

40|$|To clarify seedbank {{developmental}} {{pattern and}} its determinants, we examined relationships between seedbank, standing vegetation, and litter in a post-mined peatland on Sarobetsu Mire, northern Japan. In late fall 2006 {{and early summer}} 2007, peat was sampled from four vegetation types, and litter was also sampled from {{two of the four}} vegetation where thick litter was accumulated. Seed germination tests were performed by the samples in a glasshouse. The results were compared to the standing vegetation and litter accumulation. Seed density and species richness in seedbank gradually increased with increasing vegetation cover. Seeds in surface layer germinated more in fall than in summer. In vegetation with thick litter, small seeds, such as Drosera rotundifolia and Gentiana triflora, germinated more from peat than from litter in summer, probably due to the downward movement. Seed density in litter decreased from fall to the next summer. Moliniopsis japonica and Rhynchospora alba developed short-term persistent seedbank, whereas D. rotundifolia and G. triflora preserved long-term persistent seedbank in peat covered with thick litter. Seedbank development follows the development of the standing vegetation with litter.

Altered abiotic and biotic conditions can influence the condition of trees that can, in turn, affect tree reproductive cycles. However, the potential impact of tree decline on reproductive cycles has rarely been examined. This study investigated the influence of canopy condition on the reproductive cycle of Eucalyptus wandoo Blakely in south-western Australia. Canopy and <b>seed</b> <b>trap</b> monitoring were used to assess bud production, flowering, fruiting and seed fall over 12 months at 24 sites across two locations (Dryandra Woodland and Wandoo Conservation Park). Time since last fire, rainfall, ambient temperatures and the condition of individual trees were recorded. We found that bud production, flowering and fruiting was correlated with tree condition: healthier trees were generally associated with higher reproductive effort. Time since last fire was also strongly related to the reproductive efforts at both locations. Declining annual rainfall and increased temperatures also impact on reproduction, made evident by the aborted flowering in Dryandra Woodland. Decline in tree condition, coupled with changes in climate, have major implications for flowering phenology of this species and have the potential to alter reproductive effort, recruitment and future population dynamics. Consideration of these issues should be incorporated into the conservation management of E. wandoo and similar Eucalypt species...|$|E
40|$|International audienceQuestion: The {{vegetation}} in a polder after partial tidal restoration {{does not}} resemble the targeted salt-marsh vegetation. Is {{this difference in}} vegetation {{due to lack of}} dispersal or unsuitable abiotic conditions ? What could be done for a better restoration of the site? Location: Northwestern France. Methods: Seeds were trapped at the single inlet of the polder with a 200 -μm mesh net to estimate inputs of seeds from the bay. In parallel, seed dispersal was studied in the polder by placing Astroturf® seed traps {{on the surface of the}} sediment at three different elevations in three distinct areas. Abiotic conditions such as flooding frequency, water table level and soil salinity were monitored. Results: All but one species from the adjacent salt marshes were trapped at the inlet. Not all of these species were on the seed traps inside the polder. Seed dispersal was not homogeneous in the polder and <b>seed</b> <b>trap</b> content mostly discriminated in function of their elevation. Salinity and water logging at the bottom of the slope were very high compared to tolerance of most halophytes but decreased rapidly higher up the slope. Conclusions: The development of salt marsh target species is highly restricted by limited hydrochory inside the polder but also by unfavourable soil conditions induced by the actual hydrological regime. Halophytes are excluded at the bottom of the slope by abiotic conditions and out-competed by sub-halophytes higher up. In order to restore salt marsh vegetation inside the polder, a larger opening should be induced in order to increase the flooded surface, and diminish water logging and flooding frequencies...|$|E

40|$|Natural {{regeneration}} {{in stone}} pine (Pinus pinea L.) managed {{forests in the}} Spanish Northern Plateau is not achieved successfully under current silviculture practices, constituting a main concern for forest managers. We modelled spatio-temporal features of primary dispersal to test whether (a) present low stand densities constrain natural regeneration success and (b) seed release is a climate-controlled process. The present study is based on data collected from a 6 years <b>seed</b> <b>trap</b> experiment considering different regeneration felling intensities. From a spatial perspective, we attempted alternate established kernels under different data distribution assumptions to fit a spatial model able to predict P. pinea seed rain. Due to P. pinea umbrella-like crown, models were adapted to account for crown effect through correction of distances between potential seed arrival locations and seed sources. In addition, individual tree fecundity was assessed independently from existing models, improving parameter estimation stability. Seed rain simulation enabled to calculate seed dispersal indexes for diverse silvicultural regeneration treatments. The selected spatial model of best fit (Weibull, Poisson assumption) predicted a highly clumped dispersal pattern {{that resulted in a}} proportion of gaps where no seed arrival is expected (dispersal limitation) between 0. 25 and 0. 30 for intermediate intensity regeneration fellings and over 0. 50 for intense fellings. To describe the temporal pattern, the proportion of seeds released during monthly intervals was modelled as a function of climate variables – rainfall events – through a linear model that considered temporal autocorrelation, whereas cone opening took place over a temperature threshold. Our findings suggest the application of less intensive regeneration fellings, to be carried out after years of successful seedling establishment and, seasonally, subsequent to the main rainfall period (late fall). This schedule would avoid dispersal limitation and would allow for a complete seed release. These modifications in present silviculture practices would produce a more efficient seed shadow in managed stands...|$|E
40|$|Riparian {{ecosystems}} along streams naturally harbour a high plant diversity {{with many}} increasingly endangered species. In our current heavily modified and fragmented catchments, {{many of these}} species are sensitive to dispersal limitation. Better understanding of riparian plant dispersal pathways is required to predict species (re-) colonization potential and improve success rates of stream and riparian zone conservation and restoration. Dispersal by water (hydrochory) is an important mechanism for longitudinal and lateral dispersal of riparian species. Crucially for recruitment potential, it also influences the elevation along the riparian hydrological gradient where seeds become deposited. Due to the complex interplay between abiotic and biotic factors, however, it remains unclear how exactly patterns in seed deposition are formed. We compared hydrochorous and non-hydrochorous seed deposition, and quantified patterns of seed deposition along the bare substrate of newly created stream riparian gradients. Water levels were monitored and seed deposition was measured with <b>seed</b> <b>traps</b> along {{the full range of}} riparian hydrological conditions (from permanently flooded to never flooded). Average seed numbers and species richness were significantly higher in flooded than in non-flooded <b>seed</b> <b>traps</b> (5. 7 and 1. 5 times higher, respectively). Community-weighted trait means indicated that typically water-dispersed seeds were more dominant in flooded than in non-flooded <b>seed</b> <b>traps</b> and gradually decreased in concentration from the channel to the upland. Moreover, highly buoyant seeds accumulated at the average water line, and clear elevational sorting of non-buoyant seeds occurred within the floodplain. These results establish a critical role of flooding in shaping patterns of seed deposition along the riparian gradient, delivering many seeds of typical riparian species to riparian zones and depositing them at species-specific elevations as influenced by seed traits, suggesting species-specific dispersal pathways. This shows that hydrochory likely has important consequences for riparian vegetation development and that flooding forms a key process for successful restoration...|$|R

40|$|The {{ever-increasing}} use of paternity {{analysis to}} estimate the dispersal capability of forest trees calls for a quantitative evaluation of potential errors due to sampling design. Previous studies on optimal sampling strategies for <b>seed</b> <b>trapping</b> experiments suggested a link between sampling effort and error rate in {{the reconstruction of the}} seed dispersal kernel. We considered 92 papers on paternity analysis to quantitatively assess the sampling strategy used to study the characteristics of pollen dispersal patterns (pollen immigration rate, distribution of male reproductive success and estimates of pollen dispersal kernel parameters). For each studied stand we report data on the sampling effort (the total number of sampled seeds, the number of mother trees and the number of seeds per mother tree) and additional information on the studied species and characteristics of the sampling areas. The reviewed papers used a median of 8 mother trees (acting as pollen traps in paternity analysis studies), a median of 29 seeds per mother tree and a median of 240 total sampled seeds. These are values (especially the number of mother trees) lower than usually found in classical <b>seed</b> <b>trapping</b> studies, for which accuracy and precision of seed dispersal estimates had already been assessed. These findings underline the need of evaluating the consequences of realistic sampling efforts on the estimation of parameters describing the pollen dispersal pattern to provide the basis for meaningful guidelines to paternity analysis...|$|R
40|$|The European Union {{handed over}} the {{regulation}} of common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) to the member states. Austrian administration started to ask for control measures, i. e. the Ministry of Agriculture and most federal states of Austria contributed financially to a 3 -years national ragweed-project coordinated by the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna, involving all scientific fields {{as well as all}} stakeholders and aiming at: • Improvement of the knowledge about the plant to be controlled • Development of practical tools for control and prevention of further spread • Information of the public and initiating policy makers to install control measures The current knowledge about the biology and spreading ability of common ragweed is still not sufficient. Any sustainable control measure must focus on the reduction of seeds produced by the annual ragweed. Seed bank dimension of ragweed {{turned out to be a}} good evaluation tool for any control measure. To evaluate the importance of different spreading mechanisms of dispersal, a need for serious figures can be stated. Based on our <b>seed</b> <b>trap</b> experiments and comparable slip stream experiments by German botanists, the efficiency of vehicles in spreading ragweed over long distances was low. However, machines used by road services (cutter, moulder) turned out to spread thousands of seeds. Besides, there is serious indication that trucking agricultural food and seeds over long distances is relevant for ragweed seed dispersal. Dispersal of thousands of ragweed seeds from contaminated agricultural fields to fields not yet infested is caused by harvesters and other agricultural machines. Regulations to reduce the ragweed load in traded agricultural goods are to be implemented in future. The national RAGWEED-project listed many control options adapted for specific habitat types. Small populations of ragweed should be simply uprooted and composted as long as they bear no flowers. Ragweed biomass sampled after mid of August should be fermented professionally or burned. Based on the guidelines served by the project, policy makers but also single citizens are enabled to convey all efforts to control ragweed in Austria...|$|E
40|$|Interactions between fruiting {{plant and}} frugivorous species are {{considered}} to be highly generalized, resulting in diffuse mutualisms. Specialization has frequently been found to be either asymmetrical or the result of restricted options for frugivores. This dissertation documents a highly unusual case of reciprocal specialization between the myrtle group of yellow-rumped warblers (Dendroica coronata coronata) and wax myrtle (Myrica cerifera). Far from being {{one of a group of}} ecologically redundant dispersers, these warblers are the most valuable quantitative and qualitative contributors to this plant's recruitment on Assateague Island National Seashore, U. S. A. Fecal samples collected over four years from migrant and wintering passerines and feeding trials in two years demonstrated that wax myrtle fruit was both the most preferred fruit and a consistently major food item for myrtle warblers throughout a 7 -month residence. Abundance of wax myrtle fruit significantly affected this warbler's abundance in all years. Similarly, compared to all other frugivorous species, myrtle warbler were the most frequent and consistent consumer of wax myrtle fruit in all years. Wax myrtle seed dispersal was significantly affected by yellow-rumped warbler abundance. In order to evaluate disperser contributions to wax myrtle, I examined factors influencing seedling recruitment. Data derived from three sources 1) <b>seed</b> <b>trap</b> data from three replicated habitats, 2) experimental evaluation of the effect of time and place of seed deposition, and 3) seedling surveys confirmed that deposition was wide-spread, lasting until late April. Recruitment was greatest in both scrub and meadow habitats, but seeds deposited in meadows, especially in spring, established at higher rates than in scrub because of post-dispersal predation rates associated with microhabitat seed deposition patterns of predation among habitats. Fecal samples and observations indicated that wax myrtle has three primary dispersers: myrtle warblers, gray catbirds and tree swallows. Myrtle warblers, the only documented disperser after December, provided the greatest quantitative dispersal services. Although the germination rate and time of ingested seeds were unaffected by species identity of dispersers, post-foraging observations demonstrated that myrtle warblers were most likely to be the agent of wax myrtle seed emigration from established thickets to sites suitable for colonization...|$|E
40|$|The {{extend to}} which seed {{dispersal}} inﬂuences seedling recruitment is of major importance for forest dynamics. In non-equilibrium situations, seed dispersal {{might be of}} even further importance {{as it is a}} major determinant of the rate and composition of secondary succession. We modelled primary seed dispersal in a planted pine–spruce stand intensively recolonized by Abies alba and Fagus sylvatica, an ecological situation commonly found throughout south- ern Europe. We then evaluated the role of primary seed dispersal in seedling emergence and recruited seedling density. Using a <b>seed</b> <b>trap</b> experiment and inverse modelling methods, we calibrated short- and medium-distance seed dispersal functions. The relationship between the density of dispersed seed, the density of emerging seedlings and microsite character- istics were assessed using generalized linear models. The cumulative distribution function of seedling-to-nearest-adult distances made it possible to test the concordance between seed rain patterns and seedling spatial distributions. Seed production was highly variable between years for A. alba and F. sylvatica. Seed dispersal was shown to be locally restricted (median dispersal distance of 13. 2 – 19. 2 m for A. alba depending on the year and 6. 49 m for F. sylvatica). Model prediction was considerably increased when seed production was directly assessed (and not indirectly estimated using diameter, for example). The number of A. alba seedlings that emerged in 1999 was positively correlated with the number of seeds dispersed in 1998 and with the local density of Picea abies adults, and negatively correlated with grass cover. The spatial distribution of seedlings was less aggregated around adult trees than expected from seed dispersal models, but signiﬁcantly different from random beyond 6 m to the nearest adult for F. sylvatica and 26 m for A. alba. Thus, seed rain patterns are only partially responsible for recruitment dynamics in our model forest. Our study demonstrates that inverse modelling methods are well suited for the study of seed dispersal at the local scale, especially when a direct count of seed production can be made, and are therefore of particularly high interest in forests where several successional stages are presentPeer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Seed {{dispersal}} is {{a fundamental}} process in plant ecology and is of critical importance for the restora-tion of tropical communities. The lands of the Cabo Rojo National Wildlife Refuge (CRNWR), formerly under agriculture, were abandoned in the 1970 s and colonized mainly by non-native tree species of degraded pastures. Here we described the seed rain under the most common native and non-native trees in the refuge {{in an attempt to}} determine if focal tree geographic origin (native versus non-native) influences seed dispersal. For this, seed rain was sampled for one year under the canopies of four native and four non-native tree species common in this refuge using 40 <b>seed</b> <b>traps.</b> No significant differences were found for the abundance of seeds, or their diversity, dispersing under native versus non-native focal tree species, nor under the different tree species. A significantly different seed species composition was observed reaching native versus non-native focal species. However, this last result could be more easily explained as a function of distance of the closest adults of the two most abun-dantly dispersed plant species to the <b>seed</b> <b>traps</b> than {{as a function of the}} geographic origin of the focal species. We suggest to continue the practice of planting native tree species, not only as a way to restore the community to a condition similar to the original one, but also to reduce the distances needed for effective dispersal.

40|$|The last {{remains of}} native laurel {{forest in the}} Azores are highly {{threatened}} by the spread of invasive plants. Because landslides are very frequent in these islands, conservation of native laurel forest requires knowledge of the patterns of bird-dispersed seed rain into forest gaps. We monitored 78 <b>seed</b> <b>traps</b> over 1 year to investigate (1) the role of perches in attracting avian dispersers into gaps, (2) temporal patterns in the dispersal of exotic and native seeds, (3) how seed rain affects vegetation establishment in gaps at different distances from the native forest and (4) whether the caloric content of fruits could explain the number of seeds dispersed. Perches were highly effective in concentrating avian seed dispersal. While some native fruits are produced all year-round, most exotic plants set fruits during the main peak of the native fruit production (August–November). Most seeds recovered from the traps were native, and native seed rain inside the native forest was higher than in gaps. However, deposition of exotic seeds was not affected by distance from native forest. Seed dispersal frequencies monitored by <b>seed</b> <b>traps</b> and by faecal analysis were correlated with each other, but not with fruit caloric content, suggesting that other factors are more important that the nutritional value in predicting avian fruit choice. Forest restoration activities should take into consideration that seed dispersal decreases sharply beyond 100 m from native forest and the attractive potential of perches to direct natural seed dispersal into forest gaps...|$|R
