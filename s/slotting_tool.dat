A self-propelled slotting and drilling tool with capabilities for splitting and fragmenting the rock has been developed, known as the CUSP Miner (for Cut and Split). The <b>slotting</b> <b>tool</b> uses an abrasive waterjet for both cutting the slot and drilling the rock. Particular problems with lance stabilization have been identified and the design enhanced to overcome these for surface operation. The low reaction force of the abrasive waterjet produces a sufficiently low reaction force that the machine can be automated both for steering and for operation of the hydraulic arm. The robotic system will use a combination of sensors to form a detailed picture of the rock face to be excavated. Ultimately the computer will then form an operational plan which it will use to control the robot tooling to achieve the maximum p [...] ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} {{identify}} the mosaic, rather than the monolithic, nature of culture contact by integrating historical and archaeological sources relating {{to the concept of}} gender roles, as they influence response within a contact situation. Specifically, I examine how the Inuit gender system structured artifact patterning in Inuit-European contact situations through the investigation of three Inuit sites in Frobisher Bay, Baffin Island. These date from the 16 th, 19 th and early 20 th centuries and represent a variety of seasonal occupations and dwelling forms. The ethnographic data suggest that Inuit gender relations were egalitarian and complementary. On this basis I hypothesize that European goods and materials were used equally by men and women. Within each gendered set of tasks, European goods and materials were differently used, according to empirically functional criteria such as the nature of the tasks. Opportunities for and responses to European contact differed depending on the types of tasks in which Inuit women and men engaged and the social roles they played. Seasonality of occupation bears upon the archaeological visibility of gender activities. Sixteenth-century Elizabethan contact did not alter Nugumiut gender roles, tasks, authority or status but served primarily as a source of raw material, namely wood and iron. Based on the analysis of <b>slotted</b> <b>tools</b> I suggest a refinement to take account of the overlap in blade thickness that occurs for metal and slate, and which depends on the function of the tool. I conclude that there was much more metal use by Thule Inuit than previously believed. However, during Elizabethan contact and shortly afterwards there was actually less metal use by the Nugumiut than in the prehistoric era. Little archaeological evidence was recovered for 19 th-century commercial whaling contact, (suggesting geographic marginality to European influence), or for 19 th century Inuit occupation in the area. This is partly because of immigration to Cumberland Sound and because of subsequent structural remodelling of the dwellings by later occupants. By the early 20 th century, the archaeological record showed not only equal use of European material across gender but a near-ubiquitous distribution across most activity classes, even though commercial trapping never replaced traditional subsistence pursuits but only supplemented them...|$|R

Advances in Mechanical Engineering, 8 (9), 14. doi: 10. 1177 / 1687814016670284 Carbon fiber-reinforced plastic composites have many superior properties, including low density, high strength-to-weight ratio, and good durability, which make them attractive in many industries. However, due to anisotropic properties, high stiffness, and high abrasiveness of carbon fibers in carbon fiber-reinforced plastic, high cutting force, high tool wear, and high surface roughness are always caused in conventional machining processes. This article reports an investigation using rotary ultrasonic machining in surface grinding of carbon fiber-reinforced plastic composites {{in order to}} develop an effective and high-quality surface grinding process. In rotary ultrasonic machining surface grinding of carbon fiber-reinforced plastic composites, tool selection is of great importance since tool variables will significantly affect output variables. In this work, the effects of tool variables, including abrasive size, abrasive concentration, number of <b>slots,</b> and <b>tool</b> end geometry, on machining performances, including the cutting force, torque, and surface roughness, are experimentally studied. The results show that lower cutting forces and torque are generated by the tool with higher abrasive size, lower abrasive concentration, and two slots. Lower surface roughness is generated by the tool with smaller abrasive size, smaller abrasive concentration, two slots, and convex end geometry. This investigation will provide guides for tool selections during rotary ultrasonic machining surface grinding of carbon fiber-reinforced plastic composites...|$|R
