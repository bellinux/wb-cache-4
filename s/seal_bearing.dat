50|$|Since the 1920s, the ever-growing {{dissemination}} of <b>sealed</b> <b>bearings</b> throughout the manufacturing industries {{has made the}} use of grease fittings less common. <b>Sealed</b> <b>bearings</b> are lubricated for life at the factory, and are sealed such that the lubricant is not lost or dirtied. Grease fittings are far from obsolete, however, and much new machinery is built with them every year (e.g., tractors, lawnmowers, industrial plant equipment, and still a few car and truck parts). As long as maintenance is even minimally attended to (via occasional lube jobs where new grease is pumped into the bearing), this type of bearing and lubrication setup is cost-effective, simple, and long-lasting.|$|R

A gold cylinder <b>seal</b> <b>bearing</b> the serekh of Djedkare Isesi together with the cartouche of Menkauhor Kaiu is now on display at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.

A <b>seal</b> <b>bearing</b> both Nyuserre's and Menkauhor's names has been uncovered in the mortuary complex of Nyuserre's mother Khentkaus II. A further seal {{is believed to have}} both Nyuserre's and Djedkare's names on it, Djedkare Isesi being Nyuserre's second successor. Taken together these seals reveal that, at the very least, Menkauhor and Djedkare did not perceive Nyuserre as an antagonist.|$|E

5|$|Egyptologists Wolfgang Helck, Nicolas Grimal, Hermann Alexander Schlögl and Francesco Tiradritti {{believe that}} king Nynetjer, the third {{ruler of the}} Second dynasty and {{predecessor}} to Peribsen, ruled an Egypt that was suffering from an overly complex state administration. Nynetjer decided to split Egypt to leave it to two chosen successors who would rule two separate kingdoms, {{in the hope that}} the state administration could improve. Archaeological evidence, such as the imprinted clay seals and inscribed jars, appear to support the claim that Peribsen ruled only in Upper Egypt. A great number of these were found in Abydos, Naqada and at Elephantine, with only a single clay <b>seal</b> <b>bearing</b> his name found in Lower Egypt, at Beit Khallaf. Historians think Peribsen's realm would have extended from Naqada to the Isle of Elephantine. The rest of Egypt would therefore have been controlled by a different, coexisting ruler.|$|E
500|$|A Royal Charter {{was granted}} to the Trust in 1669. This stipulated its name to be The Governors of the Schools Founded by Erasmus Smith, Esq. and {{provided}} for a <b>seal</b> <b>bearing</b> the words [...] "We are faithful to our Trust". By 1675, the new board of 32 trustees had around £600 per annum available to them from the landholdings; by {{the first quarter of}} the 18th century this had risen to £1100. Free schools were established in Templemore, Galway and Drogheda. Funding was also given to another school, in Dublin: the recently founded King's Hospital School benefited from the trust's interest by being provided with twenty scholarships at Trinity College and also apprenticeships. The trust also funded a lectureship in Hebrew at the College, and arrangements were in place to that any surplus funds generated were used for purposes such as clothing the poor children in the grammar schools and arranging apprenticeships.|$|E
2500|$|Earlier heraldic writers {{attributed}} the lions of England to William the Conqueror, but the earliest {{evidence of the}} association of lions with the English crown is a <b>seal</b> <b>bearing</b> two lions passant, used by the future King John during the lifetime of his father, Henry II, who died in 1189. [...] Since Henry was the son of Geoffrey Plantagenet, it seems reasonable to suppose that the adoption of lions as an heraldic emblem by Henry or his sons might have been inspired by Geoffrey's shield. [...] John's elder brother, Richard the Lionheart, who succeeded his father on the throne, {{is believed to have been}} the first to have borne the arms of three lions passant-guardant, still the arms of England, having earlier used two lions rampant combatant, which arms may also have belonged to his father. [...] Richard is also credited with having originated the English crest of a lion statant (now statant-guardant).|$|E

2500|$|On 12 September 2010, the Henan Provincial Institute of Archaeology and Cultural Heritage and the Anyang County Cultural Centre {{published}} {{an article in the}} journal Kaogu (Archaeology) about the tomb. In the article, they claimed that the tomb and the adjacent one (the Xigaoxue Tomb No. 1) actually belonged to Cao Huan (the fifth and last Wei emperor) and his father Cao Yu (a son of Cao Cao) respectively. The defining piece of evidence was a seal that was initially thought to be a simple official seal, but was later discovered to be actually a <b>seal</b> <b>bearing</b> the tomb owner's name. When the seal was first revealed after it was excavated from the tomb, it was presented upside-down so the Chinese character inscribed on it in seal script did not make any sense. After the error was corrected, archaeologists recognised that the Chinese character on the seal is huan (...) , hence they deduced that the tomb was Cao Huan's. When compared with the Chinese characters inscribed on a bronze seal belonging to Cao Xiu (whose tomb's discovery was announced and confirmed in May 2010), archaeologists noticed that the Chinese character on the seal from the Xigaoxue tomb bore some slight resemblance to the Chinese character cao (...)

2500|$|The Mughals, under Aurangzeb, invaded Vijayanagara region and, having {{conquered the}} Maratha-Bijapur {{province}} of Carnatic-Bijapur-Balaghat (of which Bangalore was a part), {{made it a}} part of the Mughal province of Sira. The payment for Bangalore was consequently made to Qasim Khan, the Mughal Faujdar Diwan of Sira and, through him, Devaraja Wodeyar II [...] "assiduously cultivated an alliance" [...] with Aurangzeb. [...] He also soon {{turned his attention to the}} regions to his south which were less the objects of Moghul interest. [...] The regions around Baramahal and Salem below the Eastern Ghats were now annexed by Mysore, and in 1694, were extended by the addition of regions to the west up to the Baba Budan Mountains. [...] Two years later, Devaraja Wodeyar II attacked the lands of the Naiks of Madura and laid a siege of Trichinopoly. [...] Soon, however, Qasim Khan, his Mughal liaison, died. [...] With the intention of either renewing his Mughal connexions or seeking Mughal recognition of his southern conquests, Devaraja Wodeyar II sent an embassy to Aurangzeb, at Ahmadnagar. [...] In response, in 1700, the Mughal emperor sent the Mysore maharaja a signet ring <b>seal</b> <b>bearing</b> the title [...] "Jug Deo Raj" [...] (literally, [...] "lord and king of the world"), and permission to sit on an ivory throne, and also a sword from Aurangzeb's personal regalia, a firangi, with gold etching on the hilt, to be used as a sword of the State by the Mysore maharajas, while seated on the ivory throne. Devaraja Wodeyar II, at this time, also reorganised his administration into eighteen departments, which, even today, is famous as the 'athaara kacheri' (eighteen departments), in [...] "imitation of what the envoys had seen at the Mughal court." [...] When the maharaja died on 16 November 1704, his dominions extended from Midagesi in the north to Palni and Anaimalai in the south, and from Kodagu and Balam in the west to Baramahals in the east.|$|E
