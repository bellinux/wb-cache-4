5|$|The third {{practice}} session on Saturday saw limited running as well, as training was halted {{due to a}} massive crash by Carlos Sainz Jr.. The Spaniard lost control of his car going into turn 13, hit a wall {{and went on to}} crash into the <b>safety</b> <b>barriers,</b> burying the nose of his car in the process. The session was stopped while Sainz was taken {{out of the car and}} transported to hospital, albeit uninjured. Practice was not resumed afterwards and the time of 1:38.561 set by Nico Rosberg before the accident remained the fastest lap of the session. He was more than seven-tenths of a second faster than Valtteri Bottas in second, with Lewis Hamilton another tenth behind. Sainz's teammate Max Verstappen finished the session 17th fastest after spinning in the final corner.|$|E
5|$|Plastic seats {{replaced}} wooden benches in the West Stand in 1980 and in {{the following}} year, the club announced a deal with electronics company Pioneer Corporation with the stand expanded {{at a cost of}} around £1.3m, renamed as the Pioneer Stand and re-opened in 1983. However, the cost of building the stand meant the club had to sell players, and led to a decline in fortunes on the pitch. <b>Safety</b> <b>barriers</b> were removed from the North Stand in 1989 following the Hillsborough disaster and following the recommendations of the Taylor Report, the terraces in both the North and South stands were also converted to all-seating. The Pioneer Stand was renamed as the Britannia Stand following a new sponsorship deal with the building society in 1999, {{and in the}} following year a statue of Sir Alf Ramsey was unveiled at the corner of Portman Road and Sir Alf Ramsey Way.|$|E
5|$|The fastest LMP2 {{lap time}} was also set {{early in the}} session, with Richard Bradley {{recording}} a three minutes and 38.032 seconds time in the KCMG Oreca-Nissan, nearly a full second ahead of the Greaves Motorsport Gibson-Nissan. The Greaves car, driven by rookie Gaëtan Paletou, later caused the session's only stoppage when it collided with the <b>safety</b> <b>barriers</b> at Mulsanne Corner {{and had to be}} towed back to the garage. Aston Martin dominated the LMGTE categories in the first qualifying session, with four of their five entries leading the overall positions in the category. Stanaway set the fastest time of three minutes and 54.928 seconds in the No. 99 car, while Pedro Lamy was the fastest Amateur category entry with a three minutes and 55.102 seconds lap to be second fastest among all LMGTE cars. Gianmaria Bruni's AF Corse Ferrari was third amongst LMGTEs before ACO officials disallowed their fastest lap times for going beyond the track limits, demoting the car down the grid. The two remaining LMGTE Pro Aston Martin drivers followed the dual class pole sitters, with Corvette the first car from another marque.|$|E

40|$|Bolted road <b>safety</b> <b>barrier</b> {{connections}} utilise {{slotted holes}} that are {{perpendicular to the}} direction of the <b>safety</b> <b>barrier</b> beam. Due to the clearance between the slotted holes and the bolts, a varying amount of slippage is seen before contact with the edge of the slot is made. The stiffness characteristics of bolted road <b>safety</b> <b>barrier</b> connections have been examined with a representative test coupon that incorporates a full size <b>safety</b> <b>barrier</b> connection slot to industry standard dimensions. Previous research work has successfully determined the stiffness characteristics of the bolted connections at quasi-static strain rates. Representative non-linear finite element models of the bolted test coupons have been constructed. When compared to the laboratory results the initial stiffness, maximum force and displacement of the bolted connections are similar to the finite element model predictions. Current investigations have moved onto strain rates comparable to those observed in actual vehicle crash tests. Explicit dynamic finite element(FE) models have been constructed and validated, using experimental data produced using a series of high strain rate laboratory tests fora number of bolt configurations.

25|$|Over an {{hour after}} taking the race lead, Fässler, driving the No. 2 Audi, was forced to replace a failing turbocharger, sitting idle for twenty minutes and falling to third. Audi's No. 1 car took over the top spot after passing the No. 20 Porsche and the ailing No. 2, {{eventually}} extending its lead to one lap over the Porsche. Further down the field the No. 74 Corvette was forced {{to drop out of}} the lead battle in LMGTE Pro as the alternator belt on the car failed, requiring a visit to the garage that lost the car three laps. The No. 72 SMP Racing Ferrari of Viktor Shaitar had a crash in the Porsche Curves which damaged the <b>safety</b> <b>barriers</b> alongside the track and forced the retirement of the Ferrari. The safety car was deployed for two laps to move necessary equipment to the damaged area for repairs, while a slow zone was used after the safety car period for half an hour while the repairs were undertaken. After green flag racing resumed, the OAK Ligier of Mark Shulzhitskiy leading LMP2 was forced to the garage with engine and brake issues, eventually resuming at a slower pace. The second place TDS Ligier driven by Gommendy was also hindered after a suspension failure required repairs, and Simon Dolan's Jota Zytek improved to within a lap of the top two in class. The No. 97 Aston Martin driven by Bruno Senna, after continuing its close battle with Bruni in the No. 51 Ferrari, succumbed to the same power steering failure that had hit the No. 98 sister car. Ferrari now enjoyed a two lap lead over Richard Lietz in the No. 92 Porsche who inherited second in class.|$|E

This paper generates provably collision free swarm behaviours by constructing swarm <b>safety</b> control <b>barrier</b> certificates. The <b>safety</b> <b>barrier,</b> implemented via an optimization-based controller, serves as a low level safety controller formally ensuring the forward invariance of the safe operating set. In addition, the proposed method naturally combines the goals of collision avoidance and interference with the coordination laws in a uni ed and computationally efficient manner.

Additionally, the interaction between horizontal and vertical geometry parameters (especially vertical and horizontal curves, presented in section 2) are critical in addressing the available SSD.|$|R

2500|$|In response, Stewart campaigned with Louis Stanley (BRM team boss) for {{improved}} emergency services and better <b>safety</b> <b>barriers</b> around race tracks. [...] "We were racing at circuits {{where there were}} no crash barriers in front of the pits, and fuel was lying about in churns in the pit lane. A car could easily crash into the pits at any time. It was ridiculous." [...] As a stop-gap measure, Stewart hired a private doctor to be at all his races, and taped a spanner to the steering shaft of his BRM in case it would be needed again. Stewart pressed for mandatory seat belt usage and full-face helmets for drivers, which have become unthinkable omissions for modern races. Likewise, he pressed track owners to modernize their tracks, including organizing driver boycotts of races at Spa-Francorchamps in 1969, the Nürburgring in 1970, and Zandvoort in 1972 until barriers, run-off areas, fire crews, and medical facilities were improved.|$|E
2500|$|On 17 August 2009, CIAIAC {{released}} an interim {{report on the}} incident.

The cockpit recordings revealed that the pilots omitted the [...] "set and check the flap/slat lever and lights" [...] item in the After Start checklist. In the Takeoff Imminent verification checklist the copilot had simply repeated the correct flap and slat position values without actually checking them, {{as shown by the}} physical evidence.
