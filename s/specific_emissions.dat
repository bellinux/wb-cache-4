500|$|The {{challenge}} set by {{the greenhouse}} gas emissions of the blast furnace is being addressed in an ongoing European Program called ULCOS (Ultra Low CO2 Steelmaking). Several new process routes have been proposed and investigated in depth to cut <b>specific</b> <b>emissions</b> ( [...] per ton of steel) by at least 50%. Some rely on the capture and further storage (CCS) of , while others choose decarbonizing iron and steel production, by turning to hydrogen, electricity and biomass. In the nearer term, a technology that incorporates CCS into the blast furnace process itself and is called the Top-Gas Recycling Blast Furnace is under development, with a scale-up to a commercial size blast furnace under way. The technology should be fully demonstrated {{by the end of}} the 2010s, in line with the timeline set, for example, by the EU to cut emissions significantly.

The values of <b>specific</b> <b>emissions</b> do not reach the average national values. Mountain areas and foothills have excellent air quality and are important sources of drinking water.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, the {{environment}} is severely damaged in Plzeň. <b>Specific</b> <b>emissions</b> reported for the Plzeň-City District are several times above the national average. Plzeň and its surroundings suffer from heavy road traffic and high concentration of industrial activities. The traffic worsens {{quality of the environment}} by emissions (nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons) and noise. Moreover, the areas surrounding the municipalities Nýřany, Tlučná, Vejprnice, Břasy, Radnice, Stříbro and Ejpovice were affected by mining or quarrying activities.|$|E

From 2007, plant built earlier than that could either opt to comply with the emissions limits, or 'opt out'. Plant which opted out were limited to a maximum of 20,000 hours of further operation, and had to close completely by the end of 2015.

50|$|Compared to {{the rest}} of the Czech Republic, the quality of the {{environment}} may be regarded as good. <b>Specific</b> <b>emissions</b> in the region are lower than the national average. The least damaged areas comprise the mountainous parts of Šumava, the Bohemian Forest, western parts of Brdy Highlands, and the areas surrounding the municipalities of Manětín and Nečtiny. The protection of the environment in Šumava has been ensured by the establishment of Šumava National Park and the Šumava Landscape Protected Area. In 2005, the Protected Landscape Area Bohemian Forest was newly designated. There are 182 small protected areas in the Region and several wildlife parks have beendesignated to conserve the landscape variability.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the future}} is not known with certainty, some argue that cap and share has all the {{drawbacks}} of quantity-based regulation for a stock pollutant. In the case of greenhouse gas emissions, the argument goes, price-based regulation (incl. a carbon tax with lump-sum recycling) is more robust to uncertainty and leads to lower welfare losses. Again, however, Cap and Share advocates argue {{that the problem of}} assuring that <b>specific</b> <b>emissions</b> targets are reached is not properly addressed by using a purely price-based mechanism for emissions reduction. From their perspective, a definite, substantial decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, carried out in an equitable way so that the poor are not adversely affected, is well worth a possible decrease in [...] "welfare" [...] as measured by GDP (a highly problematic instrument for measuring wellbeing).|$|E

40|$|Life-Cycle-Analysis {{requires}} {{the analysis of}} the vertual process chain from the mining of a raw material to the deposition of the final product as well as {{the analysis of the}} horizontal process chains in order to consider more than the direct environmental impacts only. The paper demonstrates that an input-output analysis augmented with branch <b>specific</b> <b>emission</b> coefficients can improve the data base of life-cycle-analysis. A combination of both methods seems to {{be the best way to}} perform life-cycle-analysis with the input-output analysis dealing with the effects otherwise neglected. Based on the official German input-output-tables and a large techno-economic database containing <b>specific</b> <b>emission</b> coefficients this model allows the analysis of intermediate emissions of a number of relevant air and waste water pollutants as well as many other types of waste. The basic advantage of using an input-output-model is the identification not only of the direct but also of the indirect emissions of the production of a specific good. The basic design of such an enlarged input-output-system is shown. The basic input-output-model is a functionally disaggregated open Leontief-Model disaggregated into 58 branches. The economic tables serve as a basis for the German input-output-tables supplied to the EEC as part of the European input-output-tables. To connect the input-output table of such a model, representing the production and consumption sector of the economy and its foreign trade relation, to the environment, branch <b>specific</b> <b>emission</b> coefficients have to be derived for each industry as well as the private sector of final demand...|$|R

5000|$|Numerous {{states have}} emissions-testing {{programs}} to limit pollution from on-road vehicles, such as cars and light-duty trucks. Each of these vehicles must meet <b>specific</b> <b>emissions</b> targets before {{being allowed to}} obtain or renew vehicle registrations. Many of these programs are administered on the local and county level. For example, the Clean Air Car Check is a vehicle emissions-testing program for all vehicles registered in Lake and Porter counties in Indiana. The two counties were designated as non-attainment areas for ozone levels in 1977 by the Environmental Protection Agency. By 1990, the two counties were reclassified as severe non-attainment areas, a designation which requires states to create State Implementation Plans to attain and maintain certain air pollution standards. Although the counties were again reclassified in 2010, this time as attainment areas, the two counties will maintain their vehicle inspection and maintenance program {{because it is a}} [...] "key piece of Indiana's plan to prevent backsliding so that the area can remain in attainment." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{new draft}} shows that {{individual}} sectors may escape <b>specific</b> <b>emissions</b> targets {{and that an}} end date for coal-fired generation has been omitted. Earlier versions had contained sector-specific targets for energy, transport, industry, buildings, and agriculture. The energy sector which was previously slated to make a [...] "considerable" [...] contribution is now required to make an [...] "adequate" [...] contribution. Rather than saying that coal-fired generation must [...] "end well before 2050" [...] the new draft emphasizes that [...] "the importance of power production from coal will decrease" [...] and {{that there will be}} a [...] "step-by-step reduction". The previous draft stated that the transport sector would need to deliver [...] "disproportionately high" [...] emissions reductions (on account of the poor performance of the sector to date), that has now diminished to an [...] "ambitious" [...] contribution. Other proposals remain, including the development of ecological tax reform.
