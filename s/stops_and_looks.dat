500|$|While flirting, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) reveals he {{is ready}} to propose to Pam, even going as far as telling her that {{he is not going to}} do it at work ("because that would be rather lame") and when he does it, it will [...] "kick her ass". Pam is not sure if he's joking. Alone with the camera, Jim reveals that he was not joking and shows an {{engagement}} ring that he bought [...] "the week after [...] started dating." [...] After work, while walking back to his car, he stops and gets down on one knee. When Pam <b>stops</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> he says he has a question to ask her. After a second or so of hesitation, he asks her if she will wait while he ties his shoes. She laughs and they continue walking hand in hand. [...] At the end of the episode, Michael and Dwight are seen singing [...] "American Pie" [...] and dancing in the same cemetery at night, presumably having never left.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Yeah 3x" [...] {{was directed by}} Colin Tilley and filmed at the Universal Studios. It premiered on MTV on October 21, 2010, and features cameo appearances by Teyana Taylor, Kevin McCall, and Future Funk from America's Got Talent. The video opens with Brown walking down a deserted street wearing a navy sweatshirt, dark blue denim, and white sneakers. It then cuts to another scene where Brown makes an acrobatic entrance onto {{the top of a}} truck in a neighborhood of old-timey storefronts and brownstones. Wearing a black vest, trousers and a red skinny tie, Brown then leads a mob of kids, teenagers and older residents down the street. As the first chorus nears, Brown begins his first dance sequence with two male dancers. Together, they pull off high mid-air twirls, each seemingly jumping several feet above the ground. Brown then follows a woman down the street, and runs into four female dancers wearing tank tops and suspenders. Together, they perform arm movements, and work in a few hip thrusts. The next scene, Brown is seen at a storefront labeled [...] "Popin Pete's" [...] and continues more dancing with Pete. During the bridge, Brown can be seen wearing a hot pink/salmon-colored blazer, gold chain and, in one shot, carrying a massive shiny boombox. Brown then rallies the crowd from a fire escape just before someone opens a fire hydrant and unleashes a spray of water onto the crowd. In the final scene, Brown is wearing a peach blazer while baring his chest, and performs the last bit of choreography with male and female dancers. The video ends as Brown spins, <b>stops</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> off into the distance.|$|E
2500|$|Several women {{lean over}} the rails {{to check the}} snow. [...] A woman in the bottom left <b>stops</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> down behind her at a cat tugging at her kimono; the kimono bears the Zenno family's kumaizasa crest on the shoulder. [...] In the middle a woman carries a tray of food along the hallway. [...] A group of guests sits around a hibachi heating device in {{a room at the}} right. [...] In the upper right a woman carries a large furoshiki bundle full of the courtesans' and geishas' bedclothes. [...] Several women in a back room sit playing hand games. [...] The women's kimonos tend to be of subdued colours such as indigo or brown, in {{contrast}} with the bright, flashy colours of the other two paintings.|$|E
60|$|He <b>stopped,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> {{steadily}} in the trooper's eyes without speaking.|$|R
60|$|He <b>stopped,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> at Ingleby, {{whose face}} grew a trifle grave.|$|R
60|$|He <b>stopped,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> at me attentively, {{then took}} my hand again.|$|R
6000|$|... “Well, {{suppose he}} pulls gently a minute, and then <b>stops</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> round, and then I {{tell him to}} go on, and he pulls a minute again, and then <b>stops</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> round.” ...|$|E
6000|$|JOHNNY. A blue night--the moon {{over the}} Park. And she <b>stops</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> at it.--What has she wanted--the beautiful--something better than she's got--something that she'll never get! ...|$|E
6000|$|MRS. CHEVELEY. [Again {{tears at}} the {{bracelet}} in a paroxysm of rage, with inarticulate sounds. Then <b>stops,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> at LORD GORING.] What {{are you going}} to do? ...|$|E
60|$|Arrived {{in sight}} of the hotel, he <b>stopped,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> about him.|$|R
60|$|At {{these words}} the men <b>stopped,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> inquiringly at their questioner.|$|R
60|$|Mr Twitter <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> helplessly at {{the figure}} on the bed.|$|R
6000|$|He {{goes out}} through the outer office. JAMES paces the room. He [...] <b>stops</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> at COKESON, who is disconsolately rubbing the [...] knees of his trousers.|$|E
60|$|The parlor maid {{goes to the}} {{hearthrug}} {{to make up the}} fire. Conrad {{rises and}} strolls {{to the middle of the}} room, where he <b>stops</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> quizzically down at her.|$|E
60|$|SERGIUS. Louka! (She <b>stops</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> defiantly at {{him with}} the tray in her hands.) A gentleman {{has no right to}} hurt a woman under any circumstances. (With {{profound}} humility, uncovering his head.) I beg your pardon.|$|E
60|$|He started, made a short run, <b>and</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> {{over his}} shoulder.|$|R
60|$|Arrived at {{the glass}} door, I <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> back at the gravel-walk.|$|R
60|$|She <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> at him. She {{seemed to}} {{consider}} her remark complete.|$|R
60|$|TIM. Not too sthrong. [Broadbent <b>stops</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> enquiringly at him]. Say half-an-half. [Broadbent, {{somewhat}} {{startled by}} this demand, pours a little more, and again stops and looks]. Just a dhrain more: {{the lower half}} o the tumbler doesn't hold a fair half. Thankya.|$|E
6000|$|SYLVIA (whispering quickly behind Charteris as he {{is about}} to advance). Take care. She's going to hit you. I know her. (Charteris <b>stops</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> {{cautiously}} at Julia, measuring the situation. They regard one another steadfastly for a moment. Grace softly rises and gets close to Julia.) ...|$|E
6000|$|CHARTERIS (quietly, without {{relaxing}} {{his watch}} on Julia). Mrs. Tranfield: I {{think you had}} better go into another room. (Grace makes a movement towards the door, but <b>stops</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> inquiringly at Charteris as Julia springs up. He advances a step so as to prevent her from getting to the door.) ...|$|E
60|$|We <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> at {{one another}} the moment we were alone again.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Bowmore, {{returning}} {{through the}} garden-gate, instantly <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> at the woman.|$|R
60|$|No {{words could}} express my astonishment. I could only <b>stop,</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> at him.|$|R
6000|$|... [He makes {{as if to}} tear it across, <b>stops,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> down at [...] those two; {{covers his}} eyes with his hand; drops the paper and [...] rushes to the door. But he stops there and comes back, [...] magnetised, as it were, by that paper. He takes it up once more [...] and thrusts it into his pocket.] ...|$|E
60|$|So the tempter whispers. Richard Wardour tries his {{strength}} on the boat. It moves: {{he has got}} it under control. He <b>stops,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> round. Beyond him is the open sea. Beneath him {{is the man who}} has robbed him of Clara. The shadow of the deadly thought grows and darkens over his face. He waits with his hands on the boat--waits and thinks.|$|E
6000|$|It {{makes his}} head swim. He <b>stops,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> all around; climbs the nearest sand-mound, and gazes into the distance; {{shakes his head}} reflectively, and then, without a word, he turns and jogs along back to his train, and takes up a humble {{position}} under the hindmost wagon, and feels unspeakably mean, and looks ashamed, and hangs his tail at half-mast for a week. And {{for as much as}} a year after that, whenever there is a great hue and cry after a cayote, that dog will merely glance in that direction without emotion, and apparently observe to himself, [...] "I believe I do not wish any of the pie." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{this the}} man {{started to run}} away, but <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> over his shoulder.|$|R
60|$|Scraps, who {{had been}} dancing {{up and down the}} room, <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> at him.|$|R
60|$|She {{stepped out}} on the terrace, and called to him. He <b>stopped,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> up.|$|R
60|$|Tom <b>stops,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> in the window. His {{father is}} sitting close to it, in his arm-chair, his hands upon his knees, his face lifted to the sunlight, with chin {{slightly}} outstretched, and his pale eyes {{feeling for the}} light. The expression would have been painful, but for its perfect sweetness and resignation. His countenance is not, perhaps, a strong one; but its delicacy, and calm, and the high forehead, and the long white locks, are most venerable. With a blind man's exquisite sense, he feels Tom's shadow fall on him, and starts, and calls him by name; for he has been expecting him, and thinking of nothing else all the morning, and takes for granted {{that it must be}} he.|$|E
6000|$|The soul of man has {{got as far}} as it can {{without the}} body. Religion herself <b>stops</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> back, waiting for the body to {{overtake}} her. The soul's great enemy and hindrance can be made her best friend and most powerful help; and it is high time that this era were begun. We old sinners, who have lived carelessly, and almost spent our day of grace, may not gain much of its good; but the children,--shall there not be a more perfect day for them? Shall there not come a day when the little child, whom Christ set forth to his disciples as the type of the greatest in the kingdom of heaven, shall be the type no less of our physical than our spiritual advancement,--when men and women shall arise, keeping through long and happy lives the simple, unperverted appetites, the joyous freshness of spirit, the keen delight in mere existence, the dreamless sleep and happy waking of early childhood? ...|$|E
6000|$|ANNA--[To him--seeming not to {{have heard}} their interruptions.] That was why I run away from the farm. That was what made me get a yob as nurse girl in St. Paul. [With a hard, mocking laugh.] And {{you think that was}} a nice yob for a girl, too, don't you? [Sarcastically.] With all them nice inland fellers yust looking for a chance to marry me, I s'pose. Marry me? What a chance! They wasn't looking for marrying. [As BURKE lets a groan of fury escape him--desperately.] I'm owning up to {{everything}} fair and square. I was caged in, I tell you--yust like in yail--taking care of other people's kids--listening to 'em bawling and crying day and night--when I wanted to be out--and I was lonesome--lonesome as hell! [With a sudden weariness in her voice.] So I give up finally. What was the use? [She <b>stops</b> <b>and</b> <b>looks</b> at the two men. Both are motionless and silent. CHRIS seems in a stupor of despair, his house of cards fallen about him. BURKE's face is livid with the rage that is eating him up, but he is too stunned and bewildered yet to find a vent for it. The condemnation she feels in their silence goads ANNA into a harsh, strident defiance.] You don't say nothing--either of you--but I know what you're thinking. You're like all the rest! [To CHRIS--furiously.] And who's to blame for it, me or you? If you'd even acted like a man--if you'd even been a regular father and had me with you--maybe things would be different! ...|$|E
60|$|She <b>stopped,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> {{at me with}} a pale fear confessing {{itself in}} her face.|$|R
60|$|He <b>stopped,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> at her so pitifully {{that she}} could scarce keep back her tears.|$|R
60|$|I was half-way up {{the stairs}} by this time. I <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> over the banisters.|$|R
