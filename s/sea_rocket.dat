5|$|Most of North Island is {{dominated}} by chenopod shrubs, generally less than a metre (3ft) high. The beach vegetation is largely Spinifex longifolius (beach spinifex), Salsola kali (prickly saltwort), Atriplex cinerea (grey saltbush) and naturalised Cakile maritima (<b>sea</b> <b>rocket).</b> Stable dunes are vegetated by Atriplex paludosa (marsh saltbush), Scaevola crassifolia (thick-leaved fan-flower), Olearia axillaris (coastal daisy-bush), Myoporum insulare (blueberry tree) and Exocarpos sparteus (broom ballart). Sheltered areas behind dunes support Salsola kali and Myoporum insulare and also Nitraria billardierei (nitre bush), the last of these being the only plant on the island to grow over m (5ft) high. In areas where limestone {{is close to the}} surface, the vegetation consists of Pimelea microcephala (shrubby rice-flower), Spyridium globulosum (basket bush) and Acanthocarpus preissii.|$|E
25|$|Sandy beach areas {{contain a}} mix of shrubs and sedges such as the grey white cushion bush, coast sword sedge, knotted club rush, <b>sea</b> <b>rocket,</b> pigface and false caper.|$|E

5000|$|Bongbong was a Philippine liquid-propellant rocket {{developed}} under Project Santa Barbara. The rocket is {{an experimental}} system {{developed by the}} Philippine Navy {{and a group of}} scientists that could range up to 25-50 km. The rocket was named after the son of then President Ferdinand Marcos, Bongbong Marcos. The rocket was first successfully launched on March 12, 1972 and the rocket was successfully retrieved from the South China <b>Sea.</b> The <b>rocket</b> was mainly tested in Caballo island. Four testings was held in Fort Magsaysay. After the EDSA Revolution, these rockets were retired and decommissioned by former President Cory Aquino ...|$|R
50|$|Most of the 31 {{plant species}} {{recorded}} {{from the island}} are introduced. The vegetation consists of low shrubland dominated by nitre bush, grey saltbush and African boxthorn. Other prominent plants present are tree mallow, <b>sea</b> <b>rocket,</b> marram grass and hairy spinifex.|$|E
50|$|Even certain {{plants can}} {{recognise}} {{and respond to}} kinship ties. Using <b>sea</b> <b>rocket,</b> Susan Dudley at McMaster University, Canada compared the growth patterns of unrelated plants sharing a pot to plants from the same clone. She found that unrelated plants competed for soil nutrients by aggressive root growth. This did not occur with sibling plants.|$|E
50|$|The major {{habitats}} and land cover types are saltmarsh with glasswort (Salicornia dolichostachya and S. europaea), Puccinellia maritima and sea lavender (Limonium humile); sand dune complex with saltwort (Salsola kali), <b>sea</b> <b>rocket</b> (Cakile maritima), sea couchgrass (Agropyron junceiforme) etc.; beaches; lagoonal sand flat; lagoonal mud flats with algae such as Enteromorpha intestinalis, E. compressa and Ulva lactuca.|$|E
60|$|Swiftly {{it passed}} across the great desert of waters, and reached us. We seemed {{suddenly}} {{bathed in a}} blinding glare of white light, and, notwithstanding our anxiety, were forced to cover our eyes. There was a moment's suspense. Then {{the sound of a}} cannon came booming across the <b>sea,</b> and a <b>rocket</b> sped up into the air.|$|R
50|$|The chief {{engineer}} advised the Captain that the Taiaroa was making water. Life belts were handed {{out to all}} the passengers and crew. An unsuccessful {{attempt was made to}} get a line ashore. The Captain ordered all to the four life boats, the intent being to wait until light and then make for the beach. The boats were attached by lines astern but three soon capsized in the heavy <b>sea.</b> A <b>rocket</b> was sent up and a blue light burned to show the position of the beach. Most of those thrown from the capsizing lift boats were drowned having been overcome by the cold. Had they all remained on board they would most likely have all survived.|$|R
50|$|The third {{satellite}} {{was planned}} for launch by Sea Launch in Q1 2007, {{and the start}} of Far East and Australia service was planned for 15 October 2007. The failure in January 2007 of the NSS-8 mission on another <b>Sea</b> Launch <b>rocket</b> led to a substantial delay in the launch of Thuraya-3, which was rescheduled for 14 November 2007, but the launch was postponed several times due to sea conditions. The launch vessels set out from port again on 2 January 2008, and launch occurred successfully at 11:49 GMT on 15 January 2008. The Thuraya 3 satellite is technically the same as Thuraya 2, but located in geosynchronous orbit at 98.5Â° E longitude, inclined at 6.2 degrees.|$|R
50|$|P. polionotus are omnivores and the {{principal}} diet is seasonal seeds of wild grasses and forbs but blackberries, acorns, and wild pea may be consumed. Insects consumed include beetles, leaf hoppers, true bugs, and ants. Vertebrates are consumed. Beach populations will consume the fruits and wind-deposited seeds of sea oats and <b>sea</b> <b>rocket</b> and will feed on invertebrates when seeds are scarce.|$|E
50|$|This {{plant is}} found on sandy beaches, {{especially}} on barrier islands. It flourishes {{at the base}} of dunes above the high water mark. Although the seaside amaranth is found in the neighborhood of other beach plants, it is intolerant of all but American <b>sea</b> <b>rocket</b> (Cakile edentula). The plant is important in the sandy beach ecosystem, accumulating sand around itself to form dunes.|$|E
50|$|Ocean beaches are {{habitats}} with organisms {{adapted to}} salt spray, tidal overwash, and shifting sands. Some of these organisms are found only on beaches. Examples of these beach organisms {{in the southeast}} US include plants like sea oats, <b>sea</b> <b>rocket,</b> beach elder, beach morning glory (Ipomoea pes-caprae), and beach peanut, and animals such as mole crabs (Hippoidea), coquina clams (Donax), ghost crabs, and white beach tiger beetles.|$|E
50|$|A {{modified}} version, the Zenit-2S, {{is used as}} {{the first}} two stages of the <b>Sea</b> Launch Zenit-3SL <b>rocket.</b> Launches of Zenit-2 rockets are conducted from Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 45/1. A second pad, 45/2, was also constructed, but was only used for two launches before being destroyed in an explosion. A third pad, Site 35 at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome was never completed, and work was abandoned after {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet Union.|$|R
50|$|In 2010, Hamas {{carried out}} two rocket attacks on Israel from the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt. On April 22, three 122 mm Grad rockets were {{fired from the}} Sinai Peninsula at the Red Sea resort town of Eilat in the extreme south of Israel. The {{projectiles}} landed in the Red Sea and the neighboring town of Aqaba in Jordan, causing some property damage. Again on August 2, six or seven Iranian-made 122 mm Grad rockets were fired from the Sinai Peninsula at Eilat. The rockets fell in Eilat, Aqaba, Egypt and the Red <b>Sea.</b> A <b>rocket</b> that landed in Aqaba killed a Jordanian civilian and wounded several. The investigation into the attacks involved cooperation between Israel, Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority. The attacks severely damaged relations between Hamas and Egypt, which viewed them {{as a challenge to}} its sovereignty.|$|R
25|$|Around 9 am, three rockets {{were fired}} at the {{southern}} Israeli resort city of Eilat, on the Red <b>Sea</b> coast. The <b>rockets</b> were {{believed to have been}} fired by Islamist terrorists from Egypt's adjacent Sinai Peninsula. One of the rockets exploded in the yard of a home. No physical injuries or damage were reported, but a number of residents suffered from acute stress reaction. The attack forced the complete closure of Eilat Airport. Two rockets also landed in Jordan's neighboring resort city of Aqaba.|$|R
50|$|Similarly, Bhatt et al. (2010) {{show that}} Cakile edentula, the American <b>sea</b> <b>rocket,</b> {{has the ability}} to {{allocate}} more energy to root growth, and competition, in response to growing next to a stranger, and allocates less energy to root growth when planted next to a sibling. This reduces competition between siblings and increases fitness of relatives growing next to each other, while still allowing competition between non-relative plants.|$|E

50|$|The {{fringing}} vegetation {{around the}} sound includes both the saltmarshes of Oyster Harbour and Princess Royal Harbour, and the sandy beach vegetation. Saltmarshes contain {{a variety of}} species including samphire, seablite, astartea, wattle, greenbush, shore rush, twig rush and saltwater paperbark Freshwater species also occur in areas where substantial freshwater seepage occurs.Sandy beach areas contain a mix of shrubs and sedges such as the grey white cushion bush, coast sword sedge, knotted club rush, <b>sea</b> <b>rocket,</b> pigface and false caper.|$|E
50|$|From 1955 to 1958, Truax was {{assigned}} to the United States Air Force under General Bernard A. Schriever, where Truax and Dr. Adolf Thiel headed the initial design studies and IRBM specifications for the PGM-17 Thor missile. Truax subsequently worked on the Navy's Viking rocket and UGM-27 Polaris missile. Truax studied the <b>sea</b> launching of <b>rockets,</b> such as the Sea Bee and Sea Horse projects. After serving as 1957 American Rocket Society president, Truax retired from the United States Navy in 1959 and headed the Aerojet-General Advanced Development Division and Aerojet's Sea Dragon project.|$|R
50|$|Cosmos 1 was {{a project}} by Cosmos Studios and The Planetary Society {{to test a}} solar sail in space. As part of the project, an {{unmanned}} solar sail spacecraft christened Cosmos 1 was launched into space at 15:46:09 EDT (19:46:09 UTC) on June 21, 2005 from the submarine Borisoglebsk in the Barents <b>Sea.</b> However, a <b>rocket</b> failure prevented the spacecraft from reaching its intended orbit. Once in orbit, the spacecraft was supposed to deploy a large sail, upon which photons from the Sun would push, thereby increasing the spacecraft's velocity (the contributions from the solar wind are similar, but of much smaller magnitude).|$|R
25|$|The return convoy RA 61 {{was equally}} {{successful}} {{with only one}} frigate damaged by a torpedo just after leaving Kola. Vindex had to take avoiding action after detecting a torpedo coming towards her. Vindexs inexperienced squadron lost a Wildcat pilot when his plane crashed into the sea attempting to land back on board. A Swordfish crashed into the <b>sea</b> following a <b>rocket</b> assisted take off {{with the loss of}} the two man crew. Another Swordfish crashed on landing with the aircraft initially hung over the ship's side from its tail hook. When the hook gave way it crashed into the sea and only the pilot was rescued. The squadron in total lost or so severely damaged eight Swordfish and two Wildcats that they could not fly again.|$|R
