5|$|A non-chemical {{vector control}} {{strategy}} involves genetic manipulation of malaria mosquitoes. Advances in genetic engineering technologies {{make it possible}} to introduce foreign DNA into the mosquito genome and either decrease the lifespan of the mosquito, or make it more resistant to the malaria parasite. <b>Sterile</b> insect technique is a genetic control method whereby large numbers of <b>sterile</b> male mosquitoes are reared and released. Mating with wild females reduces the wild population in the subsequent generation; repeated releases eventually eliminate the target population.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} state governments issued {{requests}} for tender for {{the supply of}} <b>sterile</b> fluids and PD fluids. Baxter responded to the requests with tenders that put forward two alternative pricing options: either a state could purchase <b>sterile</b> fluids and PD fluids as a bundled package at a discounted rate, or the state could buy each product separately but at a higher rate.|$|E
5|$|Asplenium bradleyi, {{commonly}} known as Bradley's spleenwort or cliff spleenwort, is a rare epipetric fern of east-central North America. Named after Professor Frank Howe Bradley, who first collected it in Tennessee, it may be found infrequently {{throughout much of the}} Appalachian Mountains, the Ozarks, and the Ouachita Mountains, growing in small crevices on exposed sandstone cliffs. The species originated as a hybrid between mountain spleenwort (Asplenium montanum) and ebony spleenwort (Asplenium platyneuron); A.bradleyi originated when that <b>sterile</b> diploid hybrid underwent chromosome doubling to become a fertile tetraploid, a phenomenon known as allopolyploidy. Studies indicate that the present population of Bradley's spleenwort arose from several independent doublings of <b>sterile</b> diploid hybrids. A.bradleyi can also form <b>sterile</b> hybrids with several other spleenworts.|$|E
5|$|Baxter Healthcare Proprietary Limited (Baxter), was the Australian {{subsidiary}} of the multinational health care company Baxter International. Baxter manufactured intravenous (IV) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) fluids at various plants in Australia. Because {{of the cost of}} importing <b>sterile</b> IV fluids and the absence of a rival domestic producer, Baxter was a monopoly supplier of <b>sterile</b> IV fluids in the Australian market. Its monopoly covered large volume parenteral fluids, irrigating solutions and parenteral nutrition fluids. However, Baxter faced competition in the market for peritoneal dialysis fluids (PD fluids).|$|E
5|$|For {{the same}} series, episode 11 {{involved}} a villain who has discovered how to drain things of their beauty, and has reduced his planet to a <b>sterile</b> grey landscape.|$|E
5|$|Male elands {{and female}} greater kudus {{can produce a}} viable male hybrid, {{though it is not}} known if it is <b>sterile.</b> An {{accidental}} crossing of an east African common eland (T. o. pattersonianus) with an east African kudu (T. s. bea) occurred in the San Diego Zoo Safari Park. This was believed to be due to the absence of male kudus in the herd. The hybrid produced was <b>sterile,</b> which was unexpected before the study. The study conformed the chromosome numbers of both the eland and the kudu and the strangeness of their attached Y chromosomes. Reports state that repeated matings of male elands with domestic (Bos primigenius) and zebu cows (Bos indicus) have also produced <b>sterile</b> hybrids. Female elands can also act as surrogates for bongos.|$|E
5|$|Methods of {{propagation}} {{include both}} sexual and asexual reproduction. Commercial cultivars are usually <b>sterile.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{flight crew}} was criticised for not {{maintaining}} a <b>sterile</b> cockpit during the landing, with excessive non-flight related discussion going on throughout the flight.|$|E
5|$|The {{hospital}} {{treatment of the}} victims, as recorded by Chinese state media, is inconsistent with proper care of severe burn victims: for instance, patients were not kept in <b>sterile</b> rooms.|$|E
5|$|The spores of G.pectinatum are {{brown and}} opaque. They have a roughly spherical shape and are ornamented with {{transparent}} (hyaline), truncate warts; the diameter is 4–4.5µm, or 5.5–6.5 if the lengths of the warts is included. Spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are 2- or 4-spored, while cystidia (specialized <b>sterile</b> cells that {{occur at the}} hymenial surface in some mushrooms) are absent. The capillitia—a mass of thread-like <b>sterile</b> fibers dispersed among the spores—are light brown and 3–7µm in diameter. They are tapered, thick-walled with a narrow interior, and either smooth or slightly encrusted.|$|E
5|$|These are all <b>sterile.</b> In addition, several {{man-made}} hybrids {{have been}} made.|$|E
5|$|Aspleniummontanum is a small, {{evergreen}} fern which {{grows in}} tufts. The leaves are bluish-green and highly divided, proceeding {{from a long}} and often drooping stalk. A.montanum is monomorphic, with no difference in form between <b>sterile</b> and fertile fronds.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, George Bentham {{published}} the first infrageneric arrangement of Adenanthos in Volume 5 of his landmark Flora Australiensis. Bentham divided the genus into two sections, placing A.obovata in A.sect. Eurylaema, defined as containing those species with one <b>sterile</b> stamen, and perianth tubes that are curved and swollen above the middle.|$|E
5|$|Interspecific hybrids are bred by mating {{individuals}} from two species, normally {{from within the}} same genus. The offspring display traits and characteristics of both parents, but are often <b>sterile,</b> preventing gene flow between the species. Sterility is often attributed to the different number of chromosomes between the two species. For example, donkeys have 62 chromosomes, horses have 64 chromosomes, and mules or hinnies have 63 chromosomes. Mules, hinnies, and other normally <b>sterile</b> interspecific hybrids cannot produce viable gametes, because differences in chromosome structure prevent appropriate pairing and segregation during meiosis, meiosis is disrupted, and viable sperm and eggs are not formed. However, fertility in female mules has been reported with a donkey as the father.|$|E
5|$|Oxidative sewage {{treatment}} processes rely on microorganisms to oxidise organic constituents. Anaerobic microorganisms reduce sludge solids producing methane gas and a <b>sterile</b> mineralised residue. In potable water treatment, one method, the slow sand filter, employs a complex gelatinous layer {{composed of a}} wide range of microorganisms to remove both dissolved and particulate material from raw water.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} extreme {{examples}} of colonial behavior in rodents are the eusocial naked mole rat and Damaraland mole rat. The naked mole rat lives completely underground and can form colonies of up to 80 individuals. Only one female and up to three males in the colony reproduce, {{while the rest of}} the members are smaller and <b>sterile,</b> and function as workers. Some individuals are of intermediate size. They help with the rearing of the young and can take the place of a reproductive if one dies. The Damaraland mole rat is characterized by having a single reproductively active male and female in a colony where the remaining animals are not truly <b>sterile,</b> but become fertile only if they establish a colony of their own.|$|E
5|$|Some species, {{such as the}} Uruguayan Hippeastrum petiolatum, are <b>sterile</b> {{and unable}} to produce seeds. H. petiolatum is a <b>sterile</b> {{triploid}} that reproduces asexually, producing many bulbils around the mother bulb. These are light, and easily carried {{on the surface of}} water ensuring distribution of the species during the rainy season. Other species such as Hippeastrum reticulatum are self-pollinating, reproducing by distributing seed. Although this does not guarantee genetic diversity in natural populations, it is widely used by colonising species. These two examples are not however typical of the genus, which commonly reproduces through allogamy. One mechanism that limits self-pollination is that of self-incompatibility by which seeds are only produced by pollination from other plants. Furthermore, the plant generally releases its pollen about two days before its stigma is receptive, making cross-pollination more likely. Pollinators include Humming birds in subtropical areas, and moths.|$|E
5|$|Spores are thin-walled, smooth, and {{ellipsoidal}} or oval in shape. Viewed with a microscope, {{they appear}} translucent (hyaline), and stain red or blue with Melzer's reagent (in amyloid). Their dimensions are typically 7–10 by 5–7µm; the spores contain a single large oil droplet. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are club-shaped, two- to four-spored, and 25–30 by 5–7µm. The presence of <b>sterile</b> cells called pleurocystidia (large cells {{found on the}} gill face in some mushrooms) is uncommon; specimens may contain few or abundant cheilocystidia (large <b>sterile</b> cells found on the gill edge) that are club-shaped, thin-walled and 39–87.5 by 8.5–16µm in size.|$|E
5|$|They {{should be}} {{inserted}} using <b>sterile</b> technique in hospital however non-sterile technique {{may be appropriate}} in those who self catheterize. The urinary catheter set up should also be kept sealed. Evidence does not support {{a significant decrease in}} risk when silver-alloy catheters are used.|$|E
5|$|Wally Pfister {{gave each}} {{location}} and dream level a distinctive look {{to aid the}} audience's recognition of the narrative's location during the heavily crosscut portion of the film: the mountain fortress appears <b>sterile</b> and cool, the hotel hallways have warm hues, and the scenes in the van are more neutral.|$|E
5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum {{closely resembles}} the other {{species in the}} A.pedatum complex (A.pedatum and A.aleuticum), and {{distinguishing}} the three {{in the field is}} difficult. Paris and Windham, in their study of the complex, noted that while each species, collectively, can be distinguished from the others, no single morphological character was absolutely distinctive among species. <b>Sterile</b> triploid hybrids between A.viridimontanum and the other two species may occur, further complicating field identification.|$|E
5|$|An {{investigation}} found several shortcomings in the airline's operating procedures, in particular lack of proper cockpit communication and mutual {{control of the}} descent and approach plans. This was in part caused by the airline electing to not follow the <b>Sterile</b> Cockpit Rule and that a passenger {{was sitting in a}} cockpit jump seat during the flight. The investigating commission also found lack of proper pilot training in the airline. Flight 710 was the second of four Widerøe accidents between 1982 and 1993, all of which revealed shortcomings in the airline's operations and internal control.|$|E
5|$|As B.menziesii is not {{similar to}} any other Banksia, hybrids are {{unlikely}} to occur. The only reported hybrid is a <b>sterile</b> hybrid with B.hookeriana (Hooker's banksia), found north of Badgingarra by Greg Keighery. Manual cross-fertilisation with B.attenuata has resulted in germination, indicating that these two species are genetically compatible, but natural hybrids are extremely unlikely because the two species flower at different times.|$|E
5|$|CSF can {{be tested}} for the {{diagnosis}} {{of a variety of}} neurological diseases, usually obtained by a procedure called lumbar puncture. Lumbar puncture is carried out under <b>sterile</b> conditions by inserting a needle into the subarachnoid space, usually between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae. CSF is extracted through the needle, and tested. About one third of people experience a headache after lumbar puncture, and pain or discomfort at the needle entry site is common. Rarer complications may include bruising, meningitis or ongoing post lumbar-puncture leakage of CSF.|$|E
5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid is {{produced}} by the choroid plexus in the ventricles {{of the brain and}} contained by the dura and arachnoid layers of the meninges. The brain floats in CSF, which also transports nutrients to the brain and spinal cord. As holes form in the spinal dura mater, CSF leaks out into the surrounding space. The CSF is then absorbed into the spinal epidural venous plexus or soft tissues around the spine. Due to the <b>sterile</b> conditions of the soft tissues around the spine there is no risk of meningitis.|$|E
5|$|Collected in deposit, {{the spores}} of B. mirabilis are olive-brown. Viewed with a microscope, the spores are {{spindle-shaped}} to roughly elliptical, with smooth, thick walls, and have dimensions of 18–22 by 7–9µm. Overholts' 1940 publication on the species reported spore dimensions of 20–26 by 8–9µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, hyaline (translucent), 4-spored, and have dimensions of 31–36 by 7–11µm. Cystidia (<b>sterile</b> cells {{on the face}} of a gill) are thin-walled, and measure 60–90 by 10–18µm. There are no clamp connections present in the hyphae.|$|E
5|$|Drosera anglica, {{commonly}} known as the English sundew or great sundew, is a carnivorous plant species belonging to the sundew family Droseraceae. It is a temperate species with a generally circumboreal range, although it does occur as far south as Japan, southern Europe, and the island of Kauai in Hawaii, where it grows as a subtropical sundew. It is thought to originate from an amphidiploid hybrid of D. rotundifolia and D. linearis, meaning that a <b>sterile</b> hybrid between these two species doubled its chromosomes to produce fertile progeny which stabilized into the current D. anglica.|$|E
5|$|Equine {{species can}} crossbreed with each other. The most common hybrid is the mule, {{a cross between}} a male donkey and a female horse. With rare exceptions, these hybrids are <b>sterile</b> and cannot reproduce. A related hybrid, a hinny, is {{a cross between a}} male horse and a female donkey. Other hybrids include the zorse, a cross between a zebra and a horse and a zonkey or zedonk, a hybrid of a zebra and a donkey. In areas where Grévy's zebras are {{sympatric}} with plains zebras, fertile hybrids do occur.|$|E
5|$|Flower {{development}} {{begins when}} the flat meristem changes from producing leaves to an uplifted, conical meristem {{capable of producing}} stem elongation and a cluster of flowers. The cluster is a compound umbel, and each umbel contains several smaller umbels (umbellets). The first (primary) umbel occurs {{at the end of}} the main floral stem; smaller secondary umbels grow from the main branch, and these further branch into third, fourth, and even later-flowering umbels. A large, primary umbel can contain up to 50 umbellets, each of which may have as many as 50 flowers; subsequent umbels have fewer flowers. Individual flowers are small and white, sometimes with a light green or yellow tint. They consist of five petals, five stamens, and an entire calyx. The stamens usually split and fall off before the stigma becomes receptive to receive pollen. The stamens of the brown, male, <b>sterile</b> flowers degenerate and shrivel before the flower fully opens. In the other type of male <b>sterile</b> flower, the stamens are replaced by petals, and these petals do not fall off. A nectar-containing disc is present on the upper surface of the carpels.|$|E
5|$|From Rahim Khan, Amir {{learns that}} Ali {{was killed by}} a land mine and that Hassan and his wife were killed after Hassan refused to allow the Taliban to {{confiscate}} Baba and Amir's house in Kabul. Rahim Khan further reveals that Ali, being <b>sterile,</b> was not Hassan's biological father. Hassan was actually Baba's son and Amir's half-brother. Finally, he tells Amir that the reason he called Amir to Pakistan was to rescue Sohrab, Hassan's son, from an orphanage in Kabul.|$|E
5|$|In 1937 the Norwegian {{pathologist}} Leiv Kreyberg {{was allowed}} to examine one of Reich's bion preparations under a microscope. Kreyberg wrote that the broth Reich had used as his culture medium was indeed <b>sterile,</b> but that the bacteria were ordinary staphylococci. He concluded that Reich's control measures to prevent infection from airborne bacteria were not as foolproof as Reich believed. Kreyberg accused Reich of being ignorant of basic bacteriological and anatomical facts, while Reich accused Kreyberg of having failed to recognize living cancer cells under magnification.|$|E
5|$|In deposit, {{the spores}} are bright {{yellowish}} orange. Ascospores are smooth, elliptical, and typically measure 20–25 by 12–16µm. Asci (spore-bearing cells) are eight-spored, cylindrical, hyaline (translucent), and measure 225–325 by 15–22.5µm. Paraphyses are septate, and cylindrical with tips that are rounded to club-shaped, and measure 150–275 by 7–15µm. Hyphal cells on <b>sterile</b> ridges are septate, measuring 100–175 by 10–25µm. They are tightly packed {{in an even}} layer. The terminal hyphae are club-shaped to somewhat rectangular with a flattened to broadly rounded tip.|$|E
5|$|In the book, Mason Verger runs an orphanage, {{from which}} he calls {{children}} to verbally abuse {{as a substitute for}} his no longer being able to molest them. He also has a sister, Margot, whom he had raped when they were children and who is a lesbian. When she disclosed her sexual orientation to her family, their father disowned her. As she is <b>sterile</b> due to steroid abuse, Verger exerts some control over her by promising her a semen sample with which to impregnate her lover, who could then inherit the Verger fortune. Also, in the novel, Verger literally has no face and has to be kept in a <b>sterile</b> room at all times to keep bacteria from affecting exposed muscle and tissues. At the book's end, Margot and Starling both help Lecter escape during a shootout between Starling and Verger's guards. Margot, at Lecter's advice, stimulates her brother to ejaculate with a rectally inserted cattle prod, and then kills him by ramming his pet Moray eel down his throat.|$|E
5|$|In their 1962 {{monograph}} on North American Calvatia, mycologists Sanford Myron Zeller and Alexander H. Smith set C.craniiformis as {{the type}} {{species of the}} stirps (a grouping of related species) Craniiformis, containing species with a large <b>sterile</b> base and a persistent cottony gleba. Other species they included in this stirps were C.umbrina, C.diguetti, C.lycoperdoides, C.rubroflava, C.ochrogleba, C.excipuliformis (since transferred by some authorities to Handkea), and C.elata.|$|E
5|$|Josephson {{was born}} in Cardiff, Wales, to Jewish parents, Mimi (née Weisbard, 1911–1998) and Abraham Josephson. He {{attended}} Cardiff High School, where he credits some of the school masters for having helped him, particularly the physics master, Emrys Jones, who introduced him to theoretical physics. In 1957 {{he went up to}} Cambridge, where he read mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge. After completing Maths Part II in two years, and finding it somewhat <b>sterile,</b> he decided to switch to physics.|$|E
5|$|Like {{almost any}} herbivore, they consume other plants if {{presented}} with them, but their diet in nature consists {{almost entirely of}} grass, with only minimal consumption of aquatic plants. Hippos are born with <b>sterile</b> intestines, and require bacteria obtained from their mothers' feces to digest vegetation. Hippos have (rarely) been filmed eating carrion, usually close to the water. There are other reports of meat-eating, and even cannibalism and predation. The stomach anatomy of a hippo is not suited to carnivory, and meat-eating is likely caused by aberrant behaviour or nutritional stress.|$|E
