40|$|Degradation of {{dieldrin}} in soils was {{studied in}} laboratory experiments. Application of powdered zinc in dilute acetic acid, nickel chloride in sodium borohydride and potassium tertiary butoxide in dimethyl sulphoxide to pots containing <b>solonized</b> <b>brown</b> soil, podzol, red brown earth, grey clay, alluvial and krasnozem soils {{had little effect}} on the rate of degradation. Application of potassium tertiary butoxide in dimethyl sulphoxide solution to soil samples containing dieldrin achieved a rapid decrease in pesticide concentration in some cases. However, the undesirable effects of these chemicals on soil fauna and flora and on soil physical properties indicate that their use in the field could not be recommended. Adsorption of dieldrin (as illustrated by the Freundlich constant) was greater in red brown earth and grey clay soils than in the <b>solonized</b> <b>brown</b> soil. The rate of dieldrin desorption from these soils was found to be in the order <b>solonized</b> <b>brown</b> soil > red brown earth > grey clay. Dieldrin uptake by plants was determined, with carrots being found to absorb the greatest quantities of dieldrin. All plant species took up considerably more dieldrin when grown on sand than on clay. Lupin translocated very little dieldrin to the plant tops. The amounts of insecticide translocated to the plant tops were not proportional to the amounts of insecticide present in soil. Brown coal was found {{to be a very good}} dieldrin adsorbent. Addition of brown coal in the proportion 4 : 1 soil:brown coal reduced the uptake of dieldrin by carrots from contaminated soil to acceptable levels. Both mice and sheep did not show any obvious symptoms of ill-health after being fed diets containing 10 ?g g- 1 dieldrin plus 10 % brown coal for 16 weeks. Animals fed diets containing 10 % brown coal and 10 ?g g- 1 dieldrin had lower concentrations of the insecticide in the internal organs. The concentration of dieldrin in the kidney fat of sheep fed this diet was above the maximum limit suggested to apply to animals raised for human consumption.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{dissolution}} and characterization studies has been performed {{to determine if}} FB-Line residues stored in desicooler containers will dissolve using a modified H-Canyon processing flowsheet. Samples of desicooler materials were used to evaluate dissolving characteristics in the low-molar nitric acid solutions used in H-Canyon dissolvers. The selection for the H-Canyon dissolution of desicooler residues was based on their high-enriched uranium content and trace levels of plutonium. Test results showed {{that almost all of}} the enriched uranium will dissolve from the desicooler materials after extended boiling in one molar nitric acid solutions. The residue that contained uranium after completion of the extended boiling cycle consisted of <b>brown</b> <b>solids</b> that had agglomerated into large pieces and were floating on top of the dissolver solution. Addition of tenth molar fluoride to a three molar nitric acid solution containing boron did not dissolve remaining uranium from the <b>brown</b> <b>solids.</b> Only after boiling in an eight molar nitric acid-tenth molar fluoride solution without boron did remaining uranium and aluminum dissolve from the <b>brown</b> <b>solids.</b> The amount of uranium associated with <b>brown</b> <b>solids</b> would be approximately 1. 4 percent of the total uranium content of the desicooler materials. The <b>brown</b> <b>solids</b> that remain in the First Uranium Cycle feed will accumulate at the organic/aqueous interface during solvent extraction operations. Most of the undissolved white residue that remained after extended boiling was aluminum oxide containing additional trace quantities of impurities. However, the presence of mercury used in H-Canyon dissolvers should complete the dissolution of these aluminum compounds...|$|R
