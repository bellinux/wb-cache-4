25|$|Changes {{outside of}} the engine were less extreme, but with a {{distinction}} between the third and fourth generation, with changes of the engine hood. The Tremec T56 transmission was replaced with a new Tremec TR6060 with triple first-gear <b>synchronizers</b> and doubles for higher gears. The Dana M44-4 rear axle from the 2003–2006 model now has a GKN ViscoLok speed-sensing limited-slip differential that greatly helps the tires in getting grip under acceleration. Another performance upgrade was the removal of run-flat tires; the new Michelin Pilot Sport 2 tires increased grip and driver feedback and, along with revised suspension (springs, anti-roll bars, and shock valving), made the Viper more neutral in cornering.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe general PLL (Phase Lock Loop) is {{a device}} (LOOP) whose VCO (Voltage Controlled Oscillator) {{is able to}} follow (LOCK) the input signal phase (PHASE). However, the input signal can be a carrier regular {{sinusoidal}} wave, or a symbol/bit/data random stream, or a block of bits. So, in this direction, we have respectively the Carrier <b>Synchronizer</b> (CPLL), the Symbol <b>Synchronizer</b> (SPLL) and the Block <b>Synchronizer</b> (BPLL). The carrier <b>synchronizer</b> can be adapted as synthetizer of frequencies with different carriers. The symbol <b>synchronizer</b> recovers the clock of a synchronous system and can operate at different rhythms. The block <b>synchronizer</b> can produce streams of different bit rates. The three <b>synchronizer</b> prototypes {{can be adapted to}} different systems. Other objective is to study the output jitter UIRMS (Unit Interval Root Mean Square) versus input SNR (Signal noise ratio) ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Synchronizer</b> {{used for}} data {{synchronization}} posses non-zero {{probability of failure}} in Globally Asynchronous Locally synchronous System on Chip. It plays very crucial {{role in determining the}} reliability of system. <b>Synchronizer</b> is susceptible to metastability if asynchronous data changes in setup and hold time window. Theoutput of <b>synchronizer</b> is indeterminate. This risk must be mitigated. In this paper structure of <b>synchronizer</b> is proposed for improved reliability. It determines change of data in the metastability window with signal setup start (SS) and hold end(HE). To receive synchronised data, it samples <b>synchronizer</b> which is placed in parallelwith operating <b>synchronizer.</b> This parallel placed <b>synchronizer</b> receives delayed data.

[...] The German high command was protective of the synchronizer system, instructing pilots not to venture over enemy territory in case they were forced down and the secret revealed, but the basic principles involved were already common knowledge, and {{by the middle of}} 1916 several Allied <b>synchronizers</b> were already available in quantity.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A Modern complex SOC has {{a number}} of {{different}} asynchronous clock domains and data is frequently transferred from one clock domain to another which needs to be synchronized. Designer uses many types of <b>synchronizer,</b> most commonly used <b>synchronizer</b> is 2 flop <b>synchronizer</b> which is mainly used for control signals, there are other types of <b>synchronizer</b> such as MUX <b>synchronizer,</b> FIFO <b>synchronizer,</b> these are used when a multi bit signal or a bus needs to be synchronized in destination domain. Due to large design size and presence of multiple asynchronous clocks in a SOC, <b>synchronizer</b> is needed at thousands of places and it becomes very important to ensure if proper synchronization is done at all required places. STA does not cover clock domain crossing paths while gate level simulation’s are very limited since it does not cover all the CDC paths, it flags violation on CDC path only if timing’s are not met. As a standard practice, CDC verification for a SOC is mostly done using formal tools such as ―lec –verify‖, Questa CDC solution etc. These tools perform structural CDC checks for a given design. This paper explains about clock domain crossing requirement, <b>synchronizer</b> structure and a methodology to find out various issues in structural CDC checks. It also explains about reset <b>synchronizer</b> requirement & its verification. Keywords [...] CDC, Clock domain crossing verification, Synchronizers,Gate level simulation. I...|$|R
2500|$|The 2004 model S2000 {{underwent}} several significant changes. Production {{moved to}} Suzuka. The new model introduced [...] wheels and Bridgestone RE-050 tires {{along with a}} retuned suspension to reduce oversteer. The spring rates and shock absorber damping were altered and the suspension geometry modified to improve stability by reducing toe-in changes under cornering loads. The subframe also received a revision in design to achieve a high rigidity. In the gearbox the brass <b>synchronizers</b> were replaced with carbon fiber. In addition, cosmetic changes {{were made to the}} exterior with new front and rear bumpers, revised headlight assemblies, new LED tail-lights, and oval-tipped exhausts. Although all the cosmetic, suspension and most drivetrain upgrades were included on the Japanese, Australian and European S2000s, they retained the 2.0l F20C engines and remained designated as AP1s.|$|E
2500|$|Drivetrain choices {{remained}} basically {{as before}} but the high-performance pair received several noteworthy improvements. The solid-lifter unit was driven with a high-lift, long-duration camshaft to produce [...] and breathed through a big four-barrel Holley carburetor {{instead of the}} base engine's Carter unit. The fuel injected engine also gained , bringing its total to , but at a then-hefty $538.00. Although transmission options remained ostensibly the same for 1964, the two Borg-Warner T-10 four-speeds {{gave way to a}} similar pair of gearboxes built at GM's Muncie, Indiana, transmission facility. Originally a Chevy design, it had an aluminum case like the Borg-Warner box but came with stronger <b>synchronizers</b> and wider ratios for better durability and drivability. If enthusiast publications liked the first Sting Ray, they loved the 1964, though some writers noted the convertible's tendency to rattle and shake on rough roads. [...] Sales of the 1964 Sting Ray reached 22,229 - another new Corvette record, if up only a little from banner-year 1963. Coupe volume dropped to 8304 units, but convertible sales more than compensated, rising to 13,925.|$|E
2500|$|The {{synchronizer}} acts as {{an external}} trigger for both the camera(s) and the laser. [...] While analogue systems {{in the form of}} a photosensor, rotating aperture and a light source have been used in the past, most systems in use today are digital. [...] Controlled by a computer, the synchronizer can dictate the timing of each frame of the CCD camera's sequence in conjunction with the firing of the laser to within 1 ns precision. [...] Thus the time between each pulse of the laser and the placement of the laser shot in reference to the camera's timing can be accurately controlled. [...] Knowledge of this timing is critical as it is needed to determine the velocity of the fluid in the PIV analysis. Stand-alone electronic <b>synchronizers,</b> called digital delay generators, offer variable resolution timing from as low as 250 ps to as high as several ms. With up to eight channels of synchronized timing, they offer the means to control several flash lamps and Q-switches as well as provide for multiple camera exposures.|$|E

40|$|An {{engineering}} {{model of a}} generic <b>synchronizer</b> is considered. The generic <b>synchronizer</b> is modeled consisting of the selector sleeve with engaging teeth and frictional cone, the synchronizing ring with blocker and the gearwheel with engaging teeth. It is assumed that for the sleeve and synchronizing ring translational and rotational motions are feasible, for the gearwheel only rotational motion is feasible. The motion of the generic <b>synchronizer</b> is performed under the external and internal loads. The external loads comprise the vehicle resistance torque and the control force applied to the sleeve and the drag torque due to the clutch. The internal loads comprise the forces and torques arises due to interaction between the sleeve, the synchronizing ring, the gearwheel as well as oil splash during the synchronization process. A feasible synchronization process of a generic <b>synchronizer</b> is divided into four main phases: pre-synchronization, main synchronization, blocker transition (indexing for the ring), and engagement. Pre-synchronization and blocker transition are further divided into several sub-phases. The generic <b>synchronizer</b> is fully parametrized and together with description of all phases constitutes kinematics of synchronization process in question. Due {{to the nature of}} synchronization process in transmission system a motion of a <b>synchronizer</b> mechanism is subjected to unilateral or/and bilateral constraints imposed on generalized coordinates or/and generalized velocities of the <b>synchronizer.</b> Constrained Lagrangian Formalism (CLF) has been proposed as an approach for developing mathematical and computational models of a generic <b>synchronizer</b> dynamics. The CLF gives possibility to formulate direct dynamics, semi-inverse dynamics and inverse dynamics problems for a generic <b>synchronizer</b> in unified and efficient way. It is shown that CLF can be promising and useful for advanced dynamic analysis of the existing <b>synchronizer</b> mechanisms and to design novel optimized ones. In the present report mathematical and computational models of a generic <b>synchronizer</b> with five degrees of freedom have been developed using CLF. Application of CLF on the modelling of the synchronization process gives system of differential-algebraic equations (DAE). Analysis of the generic <b>synchronizer</b> performance diagrams has shown that the CLF based model is able to predict the synchronization process characteristics reasonably well. The developed model has been validated by using measurement data from test rig at CV AB Scania. Performance of the generic <b>synchronizer</b> is also analyzed in case of driveline vibrations. Sensitivity analysis of the <b>synchronizer</b> mechanism performance with respect to cone angle, coefficient of friction, maximum value of shift force and rate of applying shift force has been done. Next, the developed models will be used to get further insight into <b>synchronizer</b> design and its performance diagrams with aid of global sensitivity analysis and Pareto optimization...|$|R
