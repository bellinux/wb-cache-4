5|$|When the {{initiating}} computer <b>sends</b> <b>the</b> complete instructions, or job, {{for processing}} to the controller, the controller splits the task up into these small instruction packets, known as tasks. The {{design of the}} Xgrid system consists of these small packets being transferred to all the Xgrid-enabled computers on the network. These computers, or nodes, execute the instructions provided by the controller and then return the results. The controller assembles the individual task results into the whole job results and returns them to the initiating computer.|$|E

30|$|When in {{our case}} nodes with {{different}} sinks want to exchange messages, the messages will firstly {{be sent to the}} sink of the sender via the different preferred parents.

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the construction of}} a preset checking sequence that will not pose controllability (synchronization) and observability (undetectable output shift) problems when applied in a distributed test architectures that utilize remote testers. The controllability problem manifests itself when a tester is required to <b>send</b> <b>the</b> current input and because it did not <b>send</b> <b>the</b> previous input nor did it receive the previous output it cannot determine when to <b>send</b> <b>the</b> input. The observability problem manifests itself when a tester is expecting an output in response to either the previous input or the current input and because it is not <b>the</b> one to <b>send</b> <b>the</b> current input, it cannot determine when to start and stop waiting for the output. Based on UIO sequences, a checking sequence construction method is proposed to yield a sequence that is free from controllability and observability problems...|$|R
