50|$|The above {{explanation}} {{reflects the}} theoretical way fractionation works.

50|$|Preparative ultracentrifuges are {{available}} {{with a wide variety}} of rotors suitable for a great range of experiments. Most rotors are designed to hold tubes that contain the samples. <b>Swinging</b> <b>bucket</b> rotors allow the tubes to hang on hinges so the tubes reorient to the horizontal as the rotor initially accelerates. Fixed angle rotors are made of a single block of material and hold the tubes in cavities bored at a predetermined angle. Zonal rotors are designed to contain a large volume of sample in a single central cavity rather than in tubes. Some zonal rotors are capable of dynamic loading and unloading of samples while the rotor is spinning at high speed.|$|E
50|$|A {{wide variety}} of laboratory-scale {{centrifuges}} are used in chemistry, biology, biochemistry and clinical medicine for isolating and separating suspensions and immiscible liquids. They vary widely in speed, capacity, temperature control, and other characteristics. Laboratory centrifuges often can accept a range of different fixed-angle and <b>swinging</b> <b>bucket</b> rotors able to carry different numbers of centrifuge tubes and rated for specific maximum speeds. Controls vary from simple electrical timers to programmable models able to control acceleration and deceleration rates, running speeds, and temperature regimes. Ultracentrifuges spin the rotors under vacuum, eliminating air resistance and enabling exact temperature control. Zonal rotors and continuous flow systems are capable of handing bulk and larger sample volumes, respectively, in a laboratory-scale instrument.Another application in laboratories is blood separation. Blood separates into three main components: red blood cells, white blood cells, and plasma. DNA preparation is another common application for pharmacogenetics and clinical diagnosis. DNA samples are purified and the DNA is prepped for separation by adding buffers and then centrifuging it for {{a certain amount of}} time. The blood waste is then removed and another buffer is added and spun inside the centrifuge again. Once the blood waste is removed and another buffer is added the pellet can be suspended and cooled. Proteins can then be removed and the entire thing can be centrifuged again and the DNA can be isolated completely.|$|E

40|$|A {{method was}} {{developed}} for {{the separation of the}} high density lipoprotein subclasses HDL 2 and HDL 3 from human serum. Six serum samples are fractionated in a single-step ultracentrifugal procedure using the Beckman (SW- 40) <b>swinging</b> <b>bucket</b> rotor. The method is based on a difference in flotation rate of the high density lipoprotein subclasses. Separation of HDL 2 and HDL 3 is accomplished by a discontinuous NaBr density gradient applied on top of 2 ml of serum brought to a density of 1. 40 g/ml. After centrifugation, high density lipoprotein subclass profiles were obtained using a specially designed gradient fractionator. Contamination of the isolated high density lipoprotein subclasses by serum albumin or by apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins was minimal while only a slight overlap between the HDL 2 and HDL 3 profiles was observed. Chemical and immunochemical analyses of the high density lipoprotein subclasses isolated by the present method were in close agreement with the results obtained by rate-zonal density gradient ultracentrifugation in zonal rotors (Patsch, et al. 1980.

40|$|Background: Extracellular vesicles (EV), the {{collective}} term for vesicles released from cells, consist of vesicle species {{ranging in size}} from 30 nm to 5 µm in diameter. These vesicles are most commonly isolated by differential centrifugations, which pellets particles based on their differential movement through the liquid medium in which they are immersed. Multiple parameters, including the utilization of different rotor types, can influence the yield and purity of isolated vesicles; however, the understanding of how these factors affect is limited. Materials and methods: Here, we compare the influence of multiple centrifugation parameters, including the use of <b>swinging</b> <b>bucket</b> and fixed angle rotors, as well as different centrifugation times, for the isolation of the smallest EVs, “exosomes. ” In particular, we determine the yields of exosomal RNA and protein, as well as the nature of the isolated vesicles and possible protein contamination with methods such as electron microscopy, western blot and flow cytometry. Results: Our results show that application of a specific g-force or rotation speed by itself does not predict the ability of pelleting exosomes, and that prolonged centrifugation times can achieve greater yields of exosomal RNA and protein, whereas very long centrifugation times result in excessive protein concentrations in the exosome pellet. Conclusion: In conclusion, rotor type, g-force and centrifugation times significantly influence exosome yield during centrifugation-based isolation procedures, and current commonly recommended isolation protocols may not be fully optimized for yield and purity of exosomes...|$|E

This reduction of force con-centration and differences between flow properties, including possibly the elastic compresi!libility, of pelleti!! and dolomite, were apparently enough to negate the pulsing effects. The effect of the vertical force reduction was also evident in the case of pellets. As the level of pellets in the hopper droppped, the magnitude of the pulsing decreased.

40|$|Authors: Edward Hutchinson & Ervin Fodor ### Abstract It {{is often}} useful to {{concentrate}} and purify the pleomorphic, enveloped virions of influenza viruses prior to analysis. This protocol describes a standard method for purifying ‘spherical’ influenza virions, {{the most common}} morphology of laboratory-adapted strains, by rate-zonal ultracentrifugation through a discontinuous density gradient. The protocol, which takes around eight hours to complete, is designed for virions shed into the growth media of infected cells, and would also be suitable for concentrating virions from the allantoic fluid of embryonated chicken eggs. Two different density gradients are described: a conventional gradient of sucrose and a gradient of iodixanol (OptiPrep™ density gradient medium). A high degree of virion purity can be achieved, but small quantities of contaminants will remain. These can be removed by an optional haemadsorption-elution (HAd) step, which takes an additional one and half hours. This allows extremely efficient removal of the original contaminants, but introduces other, distinct contaminants at low levels. ### Materials Consumables required: 1. 0. 45 μm syringe filters - 50 ml syringes - 50 ml plastic tubes - 15 ml plastic tubes – optional - Thickwall tubes for the SW 28 rotor (polyallomer centrifuge tubes, 25 × 89 mm; Beckman Coulter; 355642) - Thinwall tubes for the SW 41 rotor (polyallomer centrifuge tubes, 14 × 89 mm; Beckman Coulter; 331372) - 5 ml syringe and needle (21 G or similar) - 1. 5 ml tubes - Standard plasticware, pipettes, permanent marker pen Reagents required: 1. 10 × NTC solution (1 M NaCl, 0. 2 M Tris-HCl pH 7. 4, 50 mM CaCl 2) - sucrose or OptiPrep™ density gradient medium (Sigma; D 1556) - sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) - ddH 2 O - adult chicken blood cells in Alsever’s (TCS Biosciences; FB 010) – optional ### Equipment 1. Rotating wheel – optional - Refrigerator - 37 °C water bath - Benchtop centrifuge with refrigeration (e. g. a Rotanta 460 R, Hettich Lab Technology) - Mass balance - Ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) - Beckman Coulter SW 28 <b>swinging</b> <b>bucket</b> rotor - Beckman Coulter SW 41 <b>swinging</b> <b>bucket</b> rotor - Aspiration vessel suitable for infectious material (e. g. an Integra Vacusafe; optional) - - 80 °C freezer ### Procedure 1. Prepare solutions in advance and store in the refrigerator – all should be used cold. Prepare: - a. 1 × NTC solution (from 10 × stock). - b. Working dilutions for the density gradient. If using sucrose, make 50 ml aliquots of 30, 40, 50 and 60 % solutions (w/v) by adding the required mass of sucrose to 5 ml 10 × NTC and topping up with ddH 2 O. Mix on a rotating wheel until dissolved, then pass through an 0. 45 μm syringe filter into a clean 50 ml tube. Mix equal amounts of these solutions in additional tubes to produce 35, 45 and 55 % solutions (w/v). If using OptiPrep™, follow a similar procedure to prepare a 10 – 40 % (w/v) series of iodixanol solutions in NTC (OptiPrep™ is 60 % iodixanol, so 12 ml solutions at 10, 20, 30 and 40 % should contain 1. 2 ml 10 × NTC and 2, 4, 6 and 8 ml OptiPrep™, respectively. Intermediate concentrations (15, 25 and 35 %) can be prepared by mixing, as above.) - c. To prepare a step gradient, layer 1. 5 ml {{of each of the}} seven solutions into a thinwall tube. Starting with the most concentrated solution, use a pipette to slowly add layers, 0. 75 ml at a time, taking care not to mix layers (the interfaces of different concentrations should remain visible). Gradients can be prepared in advance and stored at 4 °C (some mixing by diffusion is acceptable); if prepared during the purification this should be done during the first ultracentrifugation step. If only one gradient is required a balance can be quickly prepared by mixing 5. 25 ml of the most and least concentrated solutions, or using 10. 5 ml of the middle concentration. - d. If performing HAd, prepare chicken blood. To prevent lysis, blood should be centrifuged at no more than 1, 250 g (around 2, 500 rpm if using 15 ml tubes in a benchtop centrifuge, depending on the rotor) at 10 °C; although it should be kept cold it should not be put directly on ice. On receipt cells should be rinsed twice in chilled PBS. Comparison of the cell pellet to liquid in another tube should be used to estimate the volume of cells, and the pellet resuspended in PBS to 20 % packed cell volume (pcv) for storage in the refrigerator. If haemolysis occurs during storage the cells should be rinsed again in PBS and resuspended in an appropriate volume. When about to begin purification, pre-warm an aliquot of PBS to 37 °C. - Prepare virus to be concentrated. A maximum of 150 ml of virus-containing medium can be prepared without prior HAd. This can be obtained from six 175 cm 2 tissue culture flasks which have been seeded with a suitable cell line (e. g. Madin-Darby Bovine Kidney or Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cells), infected when sub-confluent with an influenza virus at a low multiplicity of infection, and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator for approximately 48 h. - When the virus is ready to harvest, extensive cytopathic effect will be apparent by microscopy. Transfer the media to six 50 ml tubes and centrifuge at 4 °C for 30 min at approximately 2000 g (around 4, 000 rpm, depending on the rotor) to pellet cellular debris. - Transfer the supernatant to six (thickwall) tubes and place in the buckets of an SW 28 rotor. Weigh the buckets (with the lids on) and transfer media between them as necessary to balance. Centrifuge at 4 °C for 30 min at 18, 000 g (10, 000 rpm) in an SW 28 rotor to further pellet cellular debris. Retain 1 ml sample for analysis (optional). - If extremely high purity is required (and chicken red blood cell contaminants are not problematic) perform HAd as described in steps (3) – (9). Otherwise, proceed to step (10). - Optional. Transfer supernatants to six clean, chilled 50 ml tubes and add 325 μl of chicken red blood cells (20 % pcv) to each tube. Mix by gentle inversion and refrigerate for 30 min, inverting regularly. Pellet cells (1, 250 g or around 2, 500 rpm depending on the rotor, 5 min, 10 °C). Remove supernatant, retaining 1 ml sample for analysis (optional). - Optional (cont.). Resuspend all pellet in a single aliquot of 10 ml chilled PBS – to do so, sequentially rinse each tube with the same 5 ml aliquot of PBS, repeat with a second 5 ml aliquot, and pool both aliquots a single 15 ml tube. Pellet cells (1, 250 g or around 2, 500 rpm depending on the rotor, 5 min, 10 °C). Remove supernatant, retaining 1 ml sample for analysis (optional). - Optional (cont.). Resuspend pellet in 10 ml chilled PBS (some agglutination of cells is likely to be apparent). Pellet cells (1, 250 g or around 2, 500 rpm depending on the rotor, 5 min, 10 °C). Remove supernatant, retaining 1 ml sample for analysis (optional). - Optional (cont.). Resuspend pellet in 10 ml 37 °C PBS, transfer to a clean, room-temperature 50 ml tube and increase the volume to 20 ml with 37 °C PBS. Incubate at 37 °C for 15 min, mixing regularly by gentle inversion. Pellet cells (1, 250 g or around 2, 500 rpm depending on the rotor, 5 min, 10 °C), and take 100 μl of the supernatant for analysis (optional). - Optional (cont.). Prepare two thickwall tubes with 5 ml chilled 5 % sucrose or 10 % iodixanol. Gently layer the supernatant onto the 5 ml cushion, using gravity flow and taking care not to mix the layers (the interface should remain visible). Add 20 ml PBS or water to the second tube to balance. Place the tubes in SW 28 rotor buckets and weigh with the lids on; adjust the volume of the balance tube as necessary. Proceed to step (11). - If HAd was not performed, prepare 6 thickwall tubes with 5 ml chilled 5 % sucrose or 10 % iodixanol in each. Gently layer the supernatants onto the 5 ml cushions, using gravity flow and taking care not to mix the layers (the interface should remain visible). Place the tubes in SW 28 rotor buckets and weigh with the lids on; adjust the volumes as necessary to balance across the rotor. - Pellet virions by ultracentrifugation in an SW 28 rotor at 4 °C for 90 min at 112, 000 g (25, 000 rpm). Aspirate the supernatants, taking care not to disturb the pellet (which may not be visible). When nearing the bottom of the tube, run the aspiration pipette around the meniscus and tilt away from the pellet to remove the supernatant. Add 50 μl chilled 1 × NTC to each tube (or around 500 μl to the single tube if HAd was used) and resuspend by pipetting up and down. Pool the suspension and layer gently onto the top of a density gradient (see 1. c, above) taking care not to mix the layers. Place the gradient tube and a balance tube into SW 41 rotor buckets and weigh with the lids on; adjust the volumes as necessary to balance across the rotor. - Pellet virions by ultracentrifugation in an SW 41 rotor at 4 °C for 150 min at 209, 000 g (35, 000 rpm). Afterwards, the virions should be visible as a ‘milky’ band of material at around 40 % sucrose or 30 % iodixanol. Hold the tube against a dark background and use a pen to mark the position of the meniscus and of the virions. Secure the tube and, using a 5 ml syringe and needle, carefully pierce the side of the tube a few millimetres below the virions. While moving the needle tip gently forwards and backwards, withdraw around 1 cm height of the gradient (1 – 2 ml), including the band of virions. Eject the contents of the syringe into a new thinwall tube containing 9 ml chilled 1 × NTC, and rinse out the syringe once in this solution. Place the tube and a balance tube in SW 41 rotor buckets weigh with the lids on; adjust the volumes as necessary to balance across the rotor. - Pellet virions by ultracentrifugation in an SW 41 rotor at 4 °C for 60 min at 154, 000 g (30, 000 rpm). Aspirate the supernatant, taking care not to disturb the pellet. Add around 80 μl chilled 1 ×NTC and resuspend by pipetting; this should give around 150 μl of a milky solution of purified virions. Reserve around 10 % for analysis, and store the rest in a 1. 5 ml tube at - 80 °C. ### Timing - 1. Solution preparation. When convenient. - 2. Generation of virus. Two days. - 3. Harvesting and clarification. 40 min. - 4. Transfer, balance and clarification. 50 min. - 5 – 9. HAd (optional). 90 min. - 10. Layering onto cushions. 15 min. - 11. Ultracentrifugation. 120 min. - 12. Ultracentrifugation. 180 min. - 13. Ultracentrifugation. 80 min. Approximate time for purifications (steps 3 – 13) : 8 hours without HAd, 9 and a half hours with HAd. ### Troubleshooting - Growth of virus can be assessed before beginning by microscopic examination of cells (step 3). If no cytopathic effect is visible it is unlikely that there will be enough virus to purify. - With the volumes described, concentrated virus should be visible in steps 12 and 13 (though a dark background may be necessary in step 12, and the band may be faint). Additional bands may appear in step 12 depending on the mixing of the gradient steps and on the morphology of the virus; for most applications the major band can be harvested, but if this is ambiguous the entire gradient can be harvested in aliquots from the top (step 13 is then not required). - Samples taken throughout the purification can help to identify problems. A number of assays can be used to detect virions, including plaque assay (to detect fully infectious virions – typically recovery of infectious material is around 10 – 30 %) and SDS-PAGE followed by silver-staining (to assess purity). If chicken blood is being used a quick assay for the presence of virions (whether infectious or not) can be performed while other steps are being carried out using a modified haemagglutination (HA) assay. In a 96 -well round-bottomed dish add 50 μl PBS to 11 of the 12 columns, leaving the first column empty (a multi-channel pipette is helpful throughout this assay). In the first column add 100 μl of sample or PBS (up to eight samples per dish; material from the final step in the purification should only be used if heavily diluted beforehand), and perform twofold serial dilutions of this by transferring 50 μl into the second column, mixing, changing pipette tip and repeating across the dish. Then add 50 μl chicken red blood cells (at 1 % pcv) to each well, mix and leave to stand, preferably at 4 °C. For each sample the last dilution in which the blood cells agglutinate and cannot settle {{to the bottom of the}} well contains one haemagglutinating unit (HAU). Note that, as this is a modification of the standard assay, the HAU values here are useful only for relative measures and should not be compared to other experiments. Note also that the assay is rather insensitive to low concentrations of virus. Typical end-points are 1 / 128 for the input material (in 120 ml) and 1 / 512 after HAd (in 20 ml – i. e. around 2 / 3 recovery of material). ### Anticipated Results The method described should result in a thousand-fold decrease in volume with, typically, a 10 – 30 % recovery of infectious material (plaque-forming units). As some virus will be inactivated during purification the physical recovery of material is likely to be better than this. Electron microscopy shows that virions generally remain intact during purification (see Fig 1 b of ref (1) and Fig 1 b of ref (2)). Purification without HAd is sufficient to remove the majority of contaminating material, as can be seen by SDS-PAGE and silver staining in Fig 1 a of ref (1) and Fig 1 a of ref (2), and this is likely to be sufficient for the majority of applications. However, as shown in Fig 3 b of ref (2) low levels of contaminants are still present when material is purified in this way. These contaminants can be excluded by HAd, as shown in Fig 3 c of ref (2), though this method introduces additional contaminants derived from chicken red blood cells. Readers interested in the presence of specific protein contaminants after purification with and without HAd are referred to the supplementary data of ref (2). ### References 1. Hutchinson, E.

These methods allow probing physical proximities between chromatin elements without specifically identifying the protein components that mediate such interactions. Here we describe a detailed protocol for Combined 3 C-ChIP-Cloning (6 C) technology, which combines multiple techniques to identify the proteins that bridge distant genomic regions, while simultaneously identifying such physical proximities. This method is also useful for determining if a candidate protein might mediate long-range interactions, both in cis and in trans in the nucleus. We discuss how the 6 C technique can be incorporated with other techniques to discover all the chromatin regions in the nucleus that interact with a given gene or chromatin region of interest in a specific protein-dependent manner. Such information allows complete, cell-type-specific mapping of all the chromatin interactions mediated by specific proteins. The 6 C assay advances {{our understanding of the}} three-dimensional aspects of the higher-order folding of chromatin and provides an important tool to examine the role of specific proteins in nuclear organization. In addition to providing a detailed protocol of the 6 C technique, we discuss how this technology can be used by investigators working in the area of chromatin biology, with special interest in chromatin long-range interactions. ### RELATED INFORMATION The 6 C assay combines three different methodologies: chromosome conformation capture (3 C) (Dekker et al. 2002), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and cloning (Fig. 1). The first step involves conventional 3 C methodology: The chromatin is cross-linked, digested with restriction enzymes, and ligated under conditions that favor intramolecular ligation. Immediately after ligation, the chromatin is immunoprecipitated using an antibody against the protein of interest (i. e., the suspected “bridging protein” or the protein whose mediating physical proximities the investigator wishes to map). Thereafter, the cross-links are reversed, and the DNA is purified further. The fragments obtained are then cloned into a vector harboring the same restriction enzyme site overhangs that were generated in the enzyme digestion step of the 3 C portion of the protocol. The clones are further screened by digestion with the same restriction enzyme. Ideally, clones showing multiple inserts will result from the intramolecular ligation and should represent physical proximities involving the protein targeted in the immunoprecipitation steps. These clones are chosen for sequencing to reveal the identity of the partners. ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") **Figure 1. ** Summary of the Combined 3 C-ChIP-Cloning (6 C) method.

It also determines the resolution of interaction maps that can be obtained using the 6 C assay in terms of defining the exact chromatin elements that are involved in physical pairing. Enzymes that produce cohesive ends from palindromic recognition sites are preferred in 3 C assays, and the six-cutters such as EcoRI, HindIII, and BglII are commonly used. These should cut every 4 kb along the genomic DNA and offer a good starting point. To obtain higher-resolution maps, frequent cutters such as MseI (predicted to cut every 256 bp) can be used.

Resuspend the pellet in 500 μL of 1. 14 X restriction enzyme buffer (appropriate for the restriction enzyme to be used in Step 16). 13. Pellet the cells by centrifugation. Resuspend in 500 μL of 1. 14 X restriction enzyme buffer. Transfer to 1. 5 -mL tubes. 14. Add 7. 5 μL of 20 % SDS (to a final concentration of 0. 3 % SDS). Mix by gentle pipetting. Shake gently for 1 h at 37 °C. 15. Add 50 μL of 20 % Triton X- 100 (to a final concentration of 1. 8 %). Shake gently for 1 h at 37 °C. 16.

Remove an 800 -μL aliquot from the sample (from Step 21). Add it to 7. 2 mL of ChIP diluent (i. e., a 10 -fold dilution). - *Multiple ChIP reactions can be performed from one 3 C ligation reaction. The same ligation reaction can be split and used for ChIP analyses with different antibodies*. 24. Add 4 - 10 μg of the antibody of choice per immunoprecipitation. Rotate end-over-end overnight at 4 °C. 25. Prepare the magnetic beads: - i. Mix Protein G-conjugated beads:Protein A-conjugated beads (1 : 3) in a 1. 5 -mL tube. - *Each immunoprecipitation experiment will need 100 μL of this bead mix. The choice of beads will strictly depend on the type of antibody being used*. - ii. Add 1 mL of 0. 5 % BSA in PBS and mix. - iii. Place the tube in a magnetic stand for 1 min. - iv.

Repeat Steps 25. iii- 25. iv. - vii. Resuspend the beads in 1 mL of 0. 5 % BSA in PBS. Rotate end-over-end overnight at 4 °C. 26. Add 100 μL of the blocked magnetic bead solution to each immunoprecipitate sample (from Step 24). Incubate with rotation for 3 h at 4 °C. 27. Prechill one 1. 5 -mL tube for each immunoprecipitate. 28. Transfer ~ 1. 5 mL of each immunoprecipitate to a separate prechilled tube. Place the tubes in the magnetic stand to collect the beads. Remove the supernatant. Add another aliquot of the remaining immunoprecipitate. Repeat until all the beads have been collected. - *Alternatively, pellet the magnetic beads in a centrifuge at 2000 rpm for 5 min. Aspirate some of the supernatant, leaving ~ 1 mL in the tube. Resuspend the pellet with the remaining supernatant and transfer to a chilled tube. Let the tube sit in the magnetic stand for 1 min to collect the beads. Aspirate the remaining supernatant*. 29. Remove the tubes from the magnetic stand. Place on ice. 30. Wash the beads four times with 500 μL of low-salt immune complex wash buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail. Agitate gently to resuspend the beads. Place the tubes in the magnetic stand to collect the beads. Remove the supernatant. - *Use fresh buffer for each wash. If the beads are stuck {{on the bottom of the}} tube, place on the magnetic stand momentarily to move the beads to the side and continue to invert*. 31. Wash the beads once with 500 μL of high-salt immune complex wash buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail. Agitate gently to resuspend the beads. Place the tubes in the magnetic stand to collect the beads. Remove the supernatant. 32. Wash the beads once with 1 mL of TE buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail. Collect on the magnetic stand. Remove the supernatant. - *The bead pellet is relatively loose in the TE buffer. Remove the supernatant by pipetting manually instead of vacuum aspiration*. 33. Centrifuge at 960 g for 3 min at 4 °C. Remove any residual TE buffer. 34. Add 210 μL of bead eluting buffer. Incubate for 15 min at 65 °C. Vortex briefly every 2 min. - *Alternatively, shake gently for 15 min in a shaking incubator pre-set to 65 °C*. 35. Centrifuge at 16, 000 g for 1 min at room temperature. 36. Transfer 200 μL of the supernatant to a new 1. 5 -mL tube. 37. Thaw the inputs (from Step 22). Add 190 μL of bead eluting buffer. 38. Reverse-cross-link samples (from Step 36) and inputs (from Step 37) overnight at 65 °C. - *Cover the tubes in the heat block with aluminum foil to reduce evaporation*. 39. Dilute the SDS by adding 200 μL of TE buffer. Add 8 μL of 10 mg/mL RNase A. Incubate for 2 h at 37 °C. 40. Add 8 μL of 10 mg/mL proteinase K. Incubate for 2 h at 50 °C. 41. Add an equal volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol to the samples. Shake well. Centrifuge at 10, 000 rpm for 15 min. Transfer the upper phase to a fresh tube. Repeat this step with the upper phase. 42. Precipitate the DNA by adding a one-tenth volume of 3 M sodium acetate, 1 μL glycogen, and two volumes of 100 % ethanol. 43. Wash with 0. 4 volume of 70 % ethanol. Vortex gently after adding the ethanol. 44. Dissolve the pellet in 15 μL of nuclease-free H 2 O. 45. Test the success of the ChIP reaction using 1 μL of undiluted immunoprecipitate by PCR with primers specific for a chromatin region known to be occupied by the protein of interest in the cell type under investigation. **Cloning of 3 C-Ligated Immunoprecipitated Fragments** 46. Using standard cloning protocols, clone the 3 C-ChIP products (from Step 44) into a vector that has enzyme overhangs similar to those generated in the 3 C assay. - *This step typically involves cloning an “IgG/no antibody 3 C-ChIP product” and “Plus antibody 3 C-ChIP product,” in addition to regular cloning controls*. 47. Use the ligated vector to transform high-efficiency competent bacterial cells. 48. For experimental samples, spread the surface of LB-agar plates containing the antibiotic of choice (i. e., LB-ampicillin or LB-kanamycin agar plates), with 45 μL of X-gal and 9 μL of IPTG per 100 -mm dish before plating the transformed cells. 49. The next day, count the number of blue and white colonies in the bacterial plates from samples immunoprecipitated with the specific antibody as well as the controls (i. e., no antibody or IgG). - *White colonies represent bacteria-harboring plasmids with inserts, whereas blue colonies represent bacteria with plasmids without the insert. In an ideal 6 C experiment, the number of white colonies should be several-fold higher in samples immunoprecipitated with the specific antibody than in controls. This indicates that the pull-down with a specific antibody enriched specific protein-occupied genomic regions*. 50. Pick several white colonies (i. e., containing the insert) from the bacterial plates. 51. Use each such colony to inoculate LB liquid medium containing the appropriate antibiotic. Incubate in a shaking incubator at 220 rpm overnight at 37 °C. **Plasmid Purification** 52. Purify the plasmids using the PureLink HQ 96 Mini Plasmid DNA Purification Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. - *Alternatively, standard plasmid preparation protocols or kits can also be used*. **Screening for Ligated Partners** 53. Screen the purified plasmids (from Step 52) by digestion with the same restriction enzyme used for Step 16, using standard restriction digestion protocols. 54. Separate the resulting DNA fragments by electrophoresis in a 1 % agarose gel containing SYBR Safe. Use an appropriately sized DNA ladder for reference. Visualize using UV light. *See Troubleshooting*. 55. Sequence the plasmids showing more than one insert. - *Ideally, multiple inserts mean interacting partners*. 56. Sequence the inserts using primers from two different ends of the vector (e. g., T 3 and T 7 promoter-specific primers for pBluescript II RI Predigested Vector). ### TROUBLESHOOTING 1. **Problem**: The fragments are too big, and/or there are more than two inserts in the plasmids. **[Step 54]** - **Solution**: Subclone the fragments into a new restriction enzyme-digested vector before proceeding with sequencing. ### DISCUSSION The 6 C-captured interactions should be validated by performing independent 3 C assays (Tolhuis et al. 2002), in which one performs 3 C-PCRs using multiple primer combinations from two different remote sequences. The primers for this purpose are designed exactly as described by Splinter et al. (2004). It also is important to establish, by using separate assays, that the interacting regions captured in the 6 C assay are truly occupied by the protein of interest in cells. To this end, perform ChIP assays (Tiwari et al. 2008) using antibodies specific for the protein of interest. The immunoprecipitated DNA can then be amplified using primers spanning the restriction enzyme site found to be involved in the 3 C ligation with other partner(s) in each of the 6 C clones. In early attempts of the 6 C assay (Tiwari et al. 2008), screening the clones by restriction digestion identified a very low frequency of clones having multiple inserts (five out of 352). A number of reasons could account for this. First, the rest of the clones that had a single insert probably represented distinct genomic sites that were bound by the specific protein (in this case, EZH 2) but were not engaged in any long-range associations. Interestingly, this might also reflect the frequency with which certain protein-dependent long-range associations take place in the nucleus. Second, the number of clones with multiple inserts might also be reduced because of difficulty in cloning (i. e., ligation and transformation) or sequencing of large fragments resulting from the ligation fragments generated by a six-cutter restriction enzyme (e. g., EcoRI). Third, intramolecular ligation after cross-linking and digestion will lead to a fraction of the DNA occurring as circular DNA that cannot be cloned; this might further reduce the number of clones in such an assay. Finally, the study could also have missed some interactions involving partners that bear DNA methylation at the EcoRI site (EcoRI is a DNA methylation-sensitive enzyme). Future work should develop strategies to tackle each of these issues to improve the overall efficiency of the method. The 6 C technique can be combined with other recently published techniques to discover all the chromatin regions in the nucleus that are brought in close physical proximity to the gene (or any other chromatin region of interest) in a specific protein-dependent manner (Fig. 2). Following immunoprecipitation with the antibody of interest, the samples can be subjected to 4 C analysis (Zhao et al. 2006) or reverse-cross-linked, purified, digested with a four-cutter enzyme of choice, and processed further for either 3 C-chip (Simonis et al. 2006) or the ACT assay (Ling et al. 2006). The 6 C procedure can also be used to reveal whether two known chromatin regions are brought into close physical proximity by a specific protein by following the amplification criteria used in the original 3 C assay, subsequent to the reversal of cross-linking and purification (Dekker et al. 2002). ![Figure 2]([URL] "Figure 2 ") **Figure 2 **.

50|$|Drip {{painting}} {{is a form}} of abstract art in which paint is dripped or poured on to the canvas. This style of action painting was experimented with {{in the first half of}} the twentieth century by such artists as Francis Picabia, André Masson and Max Ernst, who employed drip painting in his works The Bewildered Planet, and Young Man Intrigued by the Flight of a Non-Euclidean Fly (1942). Ernst used the novel means of painting Lissajous figures by <b>swinging</b> a punctured <b>bucket</b> of paint over a horizontal canvas.|$|R

The trajectory was determined by a heuristic reference to the real trajectory of the hoist <b>swing.</b> The <b>bucket</b> of the excavator was kept almost flat during a real hoist swing. To provide easier operation during this experiment, the operators did not control the bucket, which was always controlled downward. It was more difficult to control the excavator in this experiment than in the CG experiment, and operators sufficiently practiced before the experiment. Therefore, the number of the operators was reduced to 3, and operators had 5  days to practice for a total of 3  h. During training, display system superimposed an ideal trajectory on the camera image. Regarding the recognition of the depth, when the bucket is before the ideal trajectory, we hides the ideal trajectory of CG and taught it. Training was conducted in three cases superimposing the ideal trajectory with occlusion, superimposing the ideal trajectory without occlusion, and displaying only the camera image without the ideal trajectory. In experiment, the screen displayed only the camera image without the ideal trajectory.|$|R
