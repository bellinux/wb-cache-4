5|$|The Belfast Steamship Company's MV Munster which {{operated}} the Belfast to Liverpool route, (both British ports) flew the tricolour. But, no flag was a protection against mines; Munster struck a mine approaching Liverpool and sank. There were over 200 passengers and 50 crew on board. A {{few hours later}} they were all rescued by the collier Ringwall. Four were injured; and one died later. The L ferries Cambria, Hibernia and Scotia were Irish-registered and sailed between Dún Laoghaire and Holyhead, under the Red Ensign. Their British crews were taken aback when the tricolour was hoisted. They went on strike and refused to sail until the ships were transferred to the British registry and red ensign was restored. Scotia was sunk in the Dunkirk evacuation {{with the loss of}} 30 crew and 300 troops. Hibernia had a fortunate escape on the night of 20 December 1940. She was berthing at Dún Laoghaire when a German bomber <b>swooped</b> <b>down.</b> All lights were extinguished. Bombs fell on the nearby Sandycove railway station. The GWR ferries {{operated the}} Rosslare to Fishguard route sailed under the red ensign. Thirty lives were lost when their Saint Patrick was bombed and sunk. The British and Irish Steam Packet Company had some of its ships on the British registry with others on the Irish registry.|$|E

As well as dropping bombs, these aircraft, probably the powerful new Taube Albatros D.III, <b>swooped</b> <b>down</b> firing their machine-guns into the camp. Casualties, particularly in the horse lines which were an obvious target from the air, were considerable.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1739, Nadir Shah, the Persian invader, was {{returning}} home after plundering Delhi and Punjab. The Dal lay in wait, {{not far from the}} route he had taken. When he reached Akhnur, on the Chenab (in the present-day Jammu region), they <b>swooped</b> <b>down</b> upon the rear guard, relieving the invaders of much of their booty. On the third night they made an even fiercer attack and rescued from their hands, thousands of girls who were escorted back to their families. For a long part of his return journey, the Sikhs pursued Nadir Shah in this manner.|$|E

25|$|Pahlen {{ordered the}} two battalions in Mormant {{to hold back}} the French at all cost in order to allow the rest of his command to escape. Four Cossack regiments opposed Kellermann's corps while Rüdiger's regular cavalry faced Milhaud's corps. Jacques Gervais, baron Subervie's brigade of Pire's {{division}} turned half-right and <b>swooped</b> <b>down</b> on the Russian skirmishers while the rest of Milhaud's cavalry advanced on Rüdiger's horsemen. In the center, Gérard's infantry forced its way into the village of Mormant, flushing its defenders into the open. Pierre Ismert, leading one of Trelliard's brigades, hurled the 4th Dragoons at the fleeing Russians, forcing many to surrender. On the right flank, Lhéritier's first brigade under August Étienne Lamotte dispersed the first two Cossack regiments. When the Illowaiski and Rebrikov Cossacks tried to intervene they were swept away by Lhéritier's second brigade led by Jean Antoine de Collaert. As Lhéritier's horsemen galloped after the routed Cossacks, the 16th Dragoons of Trelliard's division charged and broke a Russian square.|$|E

[...] Tarquin's wife Tanaquil interpreted this as a sign that he would become king based on the bird, the quadrant of the sky from which it came, the god who had sent it and the fact it touched his hat (an item of clothing placed on a man's most noble part, the head).|$|E

2500|$|Auburn's first real, live-eagle mascot, War Eagle II, was {{mentioned}} in the New York Times, which noted then that [...] "War Eagle" [...] was already established as Auburn's battle cry. In November 1930 a golden eagle <b>swooped</b> <b>down</b> on a flock of turkeys in Bee Hive, Alabama, southwest of Auburn, Alabama, and became entangled in a mass of pea vines. Fourteen individuals and businesses scraped together $10 and purchased the eagle from the farmer who owned the pea patch. Cheerleaders DeWit Stier and Harry [...] "Happy" [...] Davis (who later became executive secretary of the Alumni Association) helped care for the new bird. It was put in a strong wire cage and taken to the Auburn football game against the University of South Carolina in Columbus, Georgia on Thanksgiving Day.|$|E
2500|$|On 9 November 1996, the {{motorcade}} that Aung San Suu Kyi was traveling in with other National League for Democracy leaders Tin Oo and Kyi Maung, was attacked in Yangon.

2500|$|The {{main reason}} for the {{reversal}} of fortune was Egypt's operational pause from 7 to 14 October. After capturing parts of the Sinai, the Egyptian campaign halted and the Syrians were left fighting the Israelis alone. The Egyptian leaders, believing their war aims accomplished, dug in. While their early successes in the war had surprised them, War Minister General Ahmad Ismail Ali advised caution. In Syria, Assad and his generals waited for the Egyptians to move. When the Israeli government learned of Egypt's modest war strategy, it ordered an [...] "immediate continuous action" [...] against the Syrian military. According to Patrick Seale, [...] "For three days, 7, 8, and 9 October, Syrian troops on the Golan faced the full fury of the Israeli air force as, from first light to nightfall, wave after wave of aircraft <b>swooped</b> <b>down</b> to bomb, strafe and napalm their tank concentration and their fuel and ammunition carriers {{right back to the}} Purple Line." [...] By 9 October, the Syrians were retreating behind the Purple Line (the Israeli–Syrian border since the Six-Day War). By 13 October the war was lost, but (in contrast to the Six-Day War) the Syrians were not crushed; this earned Assad respect in Syria and abroad.|$|E
2500|$|The young Luckner had {{dreams of}} being a sailor, but his father was {{determined}} that he should follow the family tradition {{and go into the}} cavalry. After failing his exams at various private schools, at the age of thirteen Luckner ran away to sea, with the promise in his mind that he would not return until he was wearing [...] "the Emperor's naval uniform, and with honour". He signed up, under the assumed name of [...] "Phylax Lüdecke", as an unpaid cabin boy on the Russian sailing ship Niobe travelling between Hamburg (Germany) and Australia. His story might have ended there, because the Russian captain, fearing that the lives of other crew members would be endangered, refused to allow a lifeboat to be launched in order to pick Luckner up when he fell overboard {{in the middle of the}} ocean. The chief mate defied the captain (who had threatened him with a harpoon), and launched a lifeboat with the help of volunteers. As a number of albatrosses circled over Luckner, one <b>swooped</b> <b>down</b> and seized his outstretched hand in its beak, but Luckner grabbed the bird in desperation. Although severely pecked, he hung on for his life. The flapping of the bird's huge wings and the circling of the other albatrosses gave the crew of the lifeboat a point to aim at in his rescue.|$|E
2500|$|The Ainu Melkor could {{initially}} {{take any}} shape, but his first recorded form was [...] "...as a mountain that wades {{in the sea}} and has its head above the clouds and is clad in ice and crowned with smoke and fire; and {{the light of the}} eyes of Melkor was like a flame that withers with heat and pierces with a deadly cold". At the time he destroyed the Two Trees and stole the Silmarils, he took to himself the shape of a great [...] "Dark Lord, tall and terrible". The diminution of his power in this time and his own desire for lordship destroyed his ability to freely change shape, and he became bound to this one [...] terrible form. His hands were burned by the theft of the Silmarils, which never healed and he evermore carried the burden of the burning pain. In his fight with High King Fingolfin, he suffered several wounds; his foot was hewn by Fingolfin's Sword of Ice Crystal, Ringil. At the end of this battle, Thorondor, the great Eagle, <b>swooped</b> <b>down</b> and scarred Morgoth's face with his talons, a wound that also never healed. In battle he wore black armour and wielded Grond, the Hammer of the Underworld. The great battering ram of Mordor was named for this weapon. He also wielded a black spear, and in early texts a poison sword.|$|E

2500|$|In 1892, when Charles F. Lummis {{was visiting}} Acoma {{he listened to}} the old Indian governor, Martín Valle, who told the story of how the Acoma people used to live on Enchanted Mesa. [...] Their access to the top was on the {{southern}} side where a large piece of the butte was said to have spalled off and formed a ramp, a [...] "stone ladder", up to the top. In reality, access was by climbing a ladder in a narrow fissure. Evidence of holes carved into the sandstone {{on either side of the}} fissure can be seen, located in the horseshoe shaped bowl at the southern end[...] The early inhabitants had a precipitous climb up the fissure, but it assured their safety. Into these holes were placed stout lengths of wood, the 'rungs' of the ladder. Today, this is still the only means of climbing access to the top of the mesa. Their fields, and the springs that were their water source, were in the valley. [...] In the summer, the entire village would descend into the valley to tend the crops. [...] One afternoon a severe thunderstorm washed away the [...] "stone ladder", leaving only sheer rock faces all the way around the butte. Legend has it that three old women and a young boy had been left in the village, but they could not get down, nor could anyone else get back to the village. A giant thunderbird <b>swooped</b> <b>down</b> and scooped up the four and carried them to the valley floor. The Acoma people abandoned Enchanted Mesa and moved to White Rock Mesa, now called Acoma.|$|E
