40|$|International audience—This study aims {{to assess}} the impact of inter-turn {{short-circuit}} in stator windings of squirrel cage induction generators on variable-speed wind turbine systems. The short-circuit fault detection is based on a steady-state technique which is Motor Current <b>Signatures</b> <b>Analysis</b> (MCSA). Thus, theoretical developments of both healthy and faulty three-phase squirrel-cage induction generator of the wind turbine system models in the abc-reference frame are made to recognize the current signature variations. Simulation results are carried out to illustrate the severe consequences of inter-turn short-circuit fault on the generator signatures and moreover on the whole system. This work highlights the importance of the existence of a robust monitoring and diagnosis system for wind turbine systems.

40|$|Abstract — Presently, many {{condition}} monitoring techniques {{that are based}} on steady-state analysis are being applied to wind generators. However, the operation of wind generators is predominantly transient, therefore prompting the development of non-stationary techniques for fault detection. In this paper we apply steady-state techniques e. g. Motor Current <b>Signatures</b> <b>Analysis</b> (MCSA) and the Extended Park’s Vector Approach (EPVA), as well as a new transient technique that is a combination of the EPVA, the Discrete Wavelet Transform and statistics, to the detection of turn faults in a doubly-fed induction generators (DFIG). It will be shown that steady-state techniques are not effective when applied to DFIG’s operating under transient conditions. The new technique shows that stator turn faults can be unambiguously detected under transient conditions. Keywords-{{condition monitoring}}; wavelets; turn faults; doubly-fed induction generators.

Specifically, two characteristic noise patterns were observed: (i) the characteristic noise pattern of quick potential changes towards more negative direction with no recovery (termed noise signature I) was found to correspond with the initiation and stabilization of the anode inside crevice; and (ii) the characteristic noise pattern of the cyclic potential oscillation at a constant frequency (termed noise signature II) was found to correspond with the stable anodic dissolution in the occluded cavity site in WBE current distribution maps. A new parameter namely the localization parameter (LP) has been proposed to describe the degree of localization. The LP for crevice corrosion was found to be low compared to that for pitting corrosion. <br /...|$|R

The first is to test whether or not the Device Under Test is working correctly. The second is when the DUT is not working correctly, to diagnose the reason. The diagnostic portion can be the most difficult and costly portion of the test. It is typical for ATE to reduce a failure to a cluster or ambiguity group of components. One method to help reduce these ambiguity groups is the addition of analog <b>signature</b> <b>analysis</b> testing to the ATE system.
