5|$|In {{her work}} How Kantian Ethics <b>Should</b> <b>Treat</b> Pregnancy and Abortion, Susan Feldman argues that {{abortion}} should be defended according to Kantian ethics. She proposed {{that a woman}} {{should be treated as}} a dignified autonomous person, with control over their body, as Kant suggested. She believes that the free choice of women would be paramount in Kantian ethics, requiring abortion to be the mother's decision. Dean Harris has noted that, if Kantian ethics is {{to be used in the}} discussion of abortion, it must be decided whether a fetus is an autonomous person. Kantian ethicist Carl Cohen argues that the potential to be rational or participation in a generally rational species is the relevant distinction between humans and inanimate objects or irrational animals. Cohen believes that even when humans are not rational because of age (such as babies or fetuses) or mental disability, agents are still morally obligated to treat them as an ends in themselves, equivalent to a rational adult such as a mother seeking an abortion.|$|E
5|$|Using the Geneforge {{to empower}} {{himself and his}} followers, the Barzites, Barzahl intends to bestow god-like {{abilities}} on himself and his followers within the city of Rising. Barzahl cut off contact with Drypeak, preparing to repel the inevitable assault of the Shaper Council, who they wish to remain independent from. The Takers, a faction of intelligent serviles who had originated on Sucia Island, were given powers by Barzahl because they worked for him. In turn the Takers created powerful dragon-like beasts called drakons, taught the drakons how to create life themselves, and betrayed Barzahl. The Takers stand for the total destruction of the Shaper Council. The Awakened, the other servile faction in Geneforge 2, believe that Shapers <b>should</b> <b>treat</b> them as equals. They had {{been working with the}} Barzites, but the Awakened's leader Learned Pinner rejected the Barzites' view that serviles need to be controlled. Trade and communications between Zakary's now Shaper Council loyalist Drypeak and the other three factions have ceased, replaced with spies and subterfuge. The player is free to decide which faction they wish to join, if any, and to explore the game world, reacting to the characters and situations they encounter.|$|E

25|$|To provide {{culturally}} sensitive patient-centered care, physicians <b>should</b> <b>treat</b> each patient as an individual, recognizing and respecting {{his or her}} beliefs, values and care seeking behaviors. However, many physicians lack the awareness of or training in cultural competence. With the constantly changing demographics, their patients are increasingly getting diverse as well. It is utterly important to educate physicians to be culturally competent {{so that they can}} effectively treat patients of different cultural and ethnic backgrounds.|$|E
25|$|The deontological {{argument}} against research on human beings is that persons are an ends in themselves. This means we cannot use people for any purpose. The deontological argument {{relies on the}} belief that we <b>should</b> <b>treat</b> others as we would like to be treated. If someone was suffering from a terminal illness and they were likely to die shortly, under deontological assumptions research could not be done on them even if it meant saving the lives of millions.|$|E
25|$|At {{the first}} signs of hypoglycemia, an insulin user <b>should</b> <b>treat</b> it {{immediately}} by consuming carbohydrate to restore blood glucose to safe levels (thereby preventing progression to severe hypoglycemia). However, not all insulin users can feel and recognize the early signs, particularly when sleeping. This can quickly lead to an emergency resulting in unconsciousness, inability to swallow, seizures, and in extreme cases death. In the past, treatment consisted of intravenous delivery of dextrose (glucose) usually in the emergency room; however, the delay in treatment due to emergency response and transport to a medical facility is life-threatening.|$|E

25|$|In August 2013, {{during the}} Muslims's grand festival Eid al-Fitr {{after the end}} of fasting month, the Taipei City Government opened two major venues in Taipei for people to gather and {{celebrate}} the festival, in which the majority of them are Indonesian blue-collar workers. Those two venues are at a square northwest of Taipei Railway Station and the other is at Daan Forest Park. The reason to choose the park because the park is located just across the Taipei Grand Mosque. Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-pin made a remark urging Taiwanese to be more considerate to foreign workers, telling them that those workers have help to make Taipei a better city to live, thus Taiwanese <b>should</b> <b>treat</b> them like families.|$|E
25|$|Sangiovese's high acidity and {{moderate}} alcohol {{makes it a}} very food-friendly wine {{when it comes to}} food and wine pairings. One of the classic pairings in Italian cuisine is tomato-based pasta and pizza sauces with a Sangiovese-based Chianti. Varietal Sangiovese or those with a smaller proportion of the powerful, full-bodied Cabernet blended in, can accentuate the flavours of relatively bland dishes like meatloaf and roast chicken. Herb seasoning such as basil, thyme and sage play off the herbal notes of the grapes. Sangiovese that has been subject to more aggressive oak treatment pairs well with grilled and smoked food. If Cabernet, Merlot or Syrah plays a dominant role, the food pairing option <b>should</b> <b>treat</b> the Sangiovese blend as one of those fuller-bodied reds and pair with heavier dishes such as steak and thick soups like ribollita and pur√©ed bean soup.|$|E
25|$|The series explores social problems, {{including}} discrimination, scientific advancement, political greed, brotherhood, family, and war. Scar's backstory and his {{hatred of}} the state military references the Ainu people, who had their land taken by other people. This includes the consequences of guerrilla warfare {{and the amount of}} violent soldiers a military can have. Some of the people who took the Ainus' land were originally Ainu; this irony is referenced in Scar's use of alchemy to kill alchemists even though it was forbidden in his own religion. The Elrics being orphans and adopted by Pinako Rockbell reflects Arakawa's beliefs about the ways society <b>should</b> <b>treat</b> orphans. The characters' dedication to their occupations reference the need to work for food. The series also explores the concept of equivalent exchange; to obtain something new, one must pay with something of equal value. This is applied by alchemists when creating new materials and is also a philosophical belief the Elric brothers follow.|$|E
40|$|Five {{cases of}} {{cartilaginous}} neoproliferation of the hip, of synovial origin, were treated by different surgical techniques. From the clinical {{point of view}} these cases can be classified as simple synovial chondromatosis and progressive synovial chondromatosis. The writers, {{on the basis of}} their own experience and on data collected from the literature, conclude that simple synovial chondromatosis <b>should</b> be <b>treated</b> by partial or total synovectomy, while progressive synovial chondromatosis <b>should</b> be <b>treated</b> by total synovectomy with or without arthroplasty with total hip prosthesis. Synovial chondrosarcoma should be considered a neoplasm with at least local malignancy and <b>should</b> be <b>treated</b> by wide surgery...|$|R

25|$|There are {{problems}} that may hinder the development the modeling of reading behaviours. First, computer models in reading {{tend to make}} assumptions of direct links between lexical properties and saccade attributes (by putting a formula linking the two into the model). These links are descriptive generalizations of existing empirical data and normally do not survive new data. In search for new data to support their models, researcher might have to keep adding and adjusting lexical process assumptions {{and are likely to}} ignore possible parsimonious process that underlies these assumptions. Caution should be taken when adding assumptions of how lexical processes affect saccade programming because reading is not what humans are evolved to do. The modeling of eye-movements in reading <b>should</b> <b>treat</b> reading as special case of visual perception and take into account more basic oculomotor properties(e.g., split fovea, depth perception) before making assumptions about the link between lexical processes and eye movements. Another problem is {{that there has been a}} lack of comparison between models on the same data set. Researcher teams tend to focus on the development of their own model and might not be able to fully appreciate the merits of other models due to the technical difficulties in sharing programs. In the future we might see unifying model that both explains complex reading behaviors well and is parsimonious enough to be generalizable to other eye-tracking fields such as visual search, scene viewing.|$|E
25|$|Yaroslavna {{is alone}} {{worrying}} about why {{she has not}} heard from Igor and his companions (Yaroslavna's Arioso). She sings of her tearful nights and nightmares and reminisces about when she was happy with Igor by her side. The nurse brings in the young women who tell Yaroslavna of their abducted friend. They are reluctant at first to reveal the culprit but eventually name Galitsky and talk of {{how he and his}} drunken followers cause trouble around Putivl. Galitsky enters and the women run away. Yaroslavna questions him as to the truth of their story and he mocks her saying she <b>should</b> <b>treat</b> him as a guest in her house. She threatens him with what Igor will do on his return, but Galitsky replies that he can seize the throne whenever he wants. Yaroslavna accuses him of repeating the betrayal that he carried out against their father, but he replies that he was only joking and asks if she has a lover now her husband is away. She threatens him with sending him back to their father. He replies that he will return the girl but will take another later and leaves. The council of boyars arrive to inform Yaroslavna that the Polovtsy under Khan Gzak are about to attack Putivl. Igor's army has been utterly destroyed and he has been wounded and captured with his son and brother. After a moment of faintness, Yaroslavna orders messengers sent to the city's allies, but the Boyars report that the roads are cut, some towns are in revolt and their princes will be captured. The Boyars say that they will organise the defence but Galitsky returns with his followers to demand that a new Prince be chosen. His retinue say it should be him as he is Yaroslavna's brother and Igor's brother-in-law. The boyars refuse. The argument is interrupted by the sight of flames and the sound of crying women. Some of the boyars flee; some join the battle, others guard the Princess. They call the attack God's judgment.|$|E
500|$|What is {{important}} to understand is what exactly Locke means when he advises parents to treat their children as reasoning beings. Locke first highlights that children [...] "love to be treated as Rational Creatures," [...] thus parents <b>should</b> <b>treat</b> them as such. Tarcov argues that this suggests children can be considered rational only in that they respond to the desire to be treated as reasoning creatures and that they are [...] "motivated only [...] rewards and punishments" [...] to achieve that goal.|$|E

Instead he recommended that they <b>should</b> <b>treat</b> the stories as [...] "a marketing masterclass", full of enticing products and brand names.

500|$|By {{the end of}} {{the eighteenth}} century, Locke's {{influence}} on educational thought was widely acknowledged.

[...] Writers as politically dissimilar as Sarah Trimmer, in her periodical The Guardian of Education (1802‚Äì06), and Maria Edgeworth, in the educational treatise she penned with her father, Practical Education (1798), invoked Locke's ideas. Even Rousseau, while disputing Locke's central claim that parents <b>should</b> <b>treat</b> their children as rational beings, acknowledged his debt to Locke.|$|E
