Supersonic flows are defined to be flows in which the flow speed is greater than the speed of sound everywhere.

2500|$|The above {{equation}} can {{be manipulated}} to solve for M {{as a function of}} H. However, due to the form of the T/T* equation, a complicated multi-root relation is formed for M = M(T/T*). Instead, M can be chosen as an independent variable where ΔS and H can be matched up in a chart as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 shows that heating will increase an upstream, subsonic Mach number until M = 1.0 and the flow chokes. [...] Conversely, adding heat to a duct with an upstream, supersonic Mach number will cause the Mach number to decrease until the flow chokes. [...] Cooling produces the opposite result for each of those two cases. The Rayleigh flow model reaches maximum entropy at M = 1.0 For <b>subsonic</b> <b>flow,</b> the maximum value of H occurs at M = 0.845. [...] This indicates that cooling, instead of heating, causes the Mach number to move from 0.845 to 1.0 [...] This is not necessarily correct as the stagnation temperature always increases to move the flow from a subsonic Mach number to M = 1, but from M = 0.845 to M = 1.0 the flow accelerates faster than heat is added to it. Therefore, this is a situation where heat is added but T/T* decreases in that region.|$|E
2500|$|Supersonic flow behaves very {{differently}} from <b>subsonic</b> <b>flow.</b> Fluids react {{to differences in}} pressure; pressure changes are how a fluid is [...] "told" [...] to respond to its environment. Therefore, since sound is in fact an infinitesimal pressure difference propagating through a fluid, {{the speed of sound}} in that fluid can be considered the fastest speed that [...] "information" [...] can travel in the flow. This difference most obviously manifests itself {{in the case of a}} fluid striking an object. In front of that object, the fluid builds up a stagnation pressure as impact with the object brings the moving fluid to rest. In fluid traveling at subsonic speed, this pressure disturbance can propagate upstream, changing the flow pattern ahead of the object and giving the impression that the fluid [...] "knows" [...] the object is there by seemingly adjusting its movement and is flowing around it. In a supersonic flow however, the pressure disturbance cannot propagate upstream. Thus, when the fluid finally reaches the object it strikes it and the fluid is forced to change its properties – temperature, density, pressure, and Mach number—in an extremely violent and irreversible fashion called a shock wave. The presence of shock waves, along with the compressibility effects of high-flow velocity (see Reynolds number) fluids, is the central difference between the supersonic and subsonic aerodynamics regimes.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a Lagrangian {{formulation of the}} Euler equations for <b>subsonic</b> <b>flows.</b> A special coordinate transformation is used to define the Lagrangian coordinates, namely the stream function and the Lagrangian distance, in function of the Cartesian coordinates. This Lagrangian formulation introduces two new geometry state variables, and a Lagrangian behavior parameter defining a pseudo-Lagrangian time used during the iteration procedure to obtain the solution for <b>subsonic</b> <b>flows.</b> The eigenstructure and characteristics analysis for the new system of equations {{is based on a}} linear Jacobian matrix-mapping procedure, which starts from the well-known eigenstructure and characteristics in the Eulerian plane and uses the coordinate transformation to find their counterparts in the Lagrangian plane. This analysis studies the basic properties of the Euler equations in the Lagrangian formulation, such as hyperbolicity, homogeneity and rotational invariance. The Riemann problem in the Lagrangian plane is also studied. Those elements are used to construct the numerical scheme for solving the Euler equations in the Lagrangian formulation. The numerical scheme is constructed using first and second-order dimensional-splitting with hybrid flux operators, based on flux vector splitting and Godunov methods, which include a 2 -D Riemann solver in the Lagrangian plane. The numerical method is validated by comparing the present solutions with the results obtained with an Eulerian formulation for several internal flows. This numerical method based on a Lagrangian formulation has also been extended for the solution of unsteady <b>subsonic</b> <b>flows</b> by using a dual time approach. The method validation in this case has been done by comparison with the Eulerian formulation solutions for several internal <b>subsonic</b> <b>flows</b> with oscillating boundaries...|$|R
