40|$|For the {{planning}} of large pedestrian facilities, the movement of pedestrians in various situations has to be modelled. Many tools for pedestrian planning are based on cellular automata (CA), discrete in space and time, some use self driven pargticles (SDP), continuous in space and time.

They tend to move the pedestrians to the innermost lanes far too strongly, thereby reducing {{the capacity of the}} facility. With SDP, the problem seems to be less pronounced but still present. With CA, we compare the performance of two standard shortest distance based static floors on 90 and 180 degree bends with a newly defined one.

40|$|The {{consideration}} of risk in regulatory decision-making {{has long been}} a part of NRC's policy and practice. Initially, these considerations were qualitative and were based on risk insights. The early regulations relied on good practices, past insights, and accepted standards. As a result, most NRC regulations were prescriptive and were applied uniformly to all areas within the regulatory scope. Risk technology is changing regulations by prioritizing the areas within regulatory scope based on risk, thereby focusing on the risk-important areas. Performance technology, on the other hand, is changing the regulations by allowing requirements to be adjusted based on the specific performance expected and manifested, rather than a prior prescriptive requirement. Consistent with the objectives of risk-informed and performance-based regulatory requirements, BNL evaluated the feasibility of applying risk- and performance-technologies to modifying NRC's current regulations <b>on</b> <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> for nuclear power plants.

The {{extensive use of}} combustible insulation materials without proper <b>fire</b> <b>protections</b> and barriers were believed {{to contribute to the}} uncontrollable fire spread in the high-rise buildings. This paper reviews the current code and standard environment regulating the fire safety of exterior wall claddings in China.

The recent research progress and regulation development <b>on</b> the <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> of exterior wall claddings are also presented.
