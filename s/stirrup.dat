5|$|Stirrup: There are {{authors who}} {{point out that}} it is unclear whether the <b>stirrup</b> was invented by {{northern}} nomads or the sedentary Chinese. Liu Han (1961) credited the invention of the <b>stirrup</b> to nomadic invaders of northern China. Archaeologial evidence shows that horse riders in India had a small loop for a single toe to be inserted by roughly the 1st century AD. However, the first true depiction of the <b>stirrup</b> is featured on a Jin Dynasty (265–420) Chinese tomb figurine dated 302 AD, yet this was a single <b>stirrup</b> and was perhaps used only for initially mounting the horse. The first validated depiction of a rider with a pair of saddle stirrups for both feet comes from a Jin Chinese tomb figurine dated 322. The first actual specimens of stirrups comes from a Chinese tomb in southern Manchuria that is dated 415. The <b>stirrup</b> was not widely used by Chinese cavalry until the 5th century. By the 6th century, the use of the <b>stirrup</b> had spread as far west as the Byzantine Empire, where both the <b>stirrup</b> and Celtic horseshoe were adopted.|$|E
5|$|The {{increased}} use of the <b>stirrup</b> from the 8th century on aided the warrior's stability and security in the saddle when fighting. This {{may have led to}} greater use of shock tactics, although a couched lance could be used effectively without stirrups. In particular, Charles Martel recognized the military potential of the <b>stirrup,</b> and distributed seized lands to his retainers on condition that they serve him by fighting in the new manner.|$|E

Perhaps no other temple in the country depicts the Ramayana and Mahabharata epics more effectively than the Hoysaleshwara temple at Halebidu.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of green construction {{with the goal}} of developing the world of constructions are growing. Production process of making steel reinforcement gives negative impact to the environment, such as air pollution, hazardous chemicals and energy waste. This study examines the effectiveness of using reinforcement <b>stirrups</b> in term of their strength and cost. Vertical <b>stirrups</b> have various connection types, such as hooked <b>stirrups</b> and welding connected <b>stirrups.</b> In this study, 6 beam specimens with 3 <b>stirrups</b> variations were prepared, they are 2 beams with hooked <b>stirrups</b> of 135 ⁰, 2 beams with <b>stirrups</b> welded at the corner and 2 beams with <b>stirrups</b> welded at the center. Eksperimental results of deep beams without compression reinforcements show that the maximum load that can be resisted by both the beams with hooked <b>stirrups</b> and corner welded <b>stirrups</b> are comparable. With regard to the cost, replacement of hooked <b>stirrups</b> with corner welded <b>stirrups</b> can save 5 - 10 % of the total steel used for <b>stirrups...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{this present}} study, {{experimental}} work {{was conducted to}} study the effectiveness of newly innovated steel-CFRP composite (CFRP laminates sandwiched between two steel strips) as <b>stirrups.</b> A total numbers of eight concrete beams were tested under four point loads. Each beam measured 1600 mm long, 160 mm width and 240 mm depth. The beams were reinforced with different shear reinforcements; one without <b>stirrups,</b> one with steel <b>stirrups</b> and six with different types and numbers of steel-CRFR <b>stirrups.</b> Test {{results indicated that the}} steel-CFRP <b>stirrups</b> had enhanced the shear strength capacity of beams. Moreover, the tests revealed that steel-CFRP <b>stirrups</b> reached to their ultimate tensile strength unlike FRP <b>stirrups</b> which rupture at much lower level than their ultimate strength as werereported in various researches...|$|R
40|$|Carbon fiber {{composite}} cable (CFCC) reinforcement has been broadly {{accepted as a}} non-corrosive alternative to the conventional steel reinforcement in bridge construction. Although the flexural behavior of beams prestressed with CFCC strands has been thoroughly examined, their shear behavior when steel <b>stirrups</b> are replaced with CFCC <b>stirrups</b> remains uncertain. This study outlines an extensive research program conducted to evaluate the shear behavior of prestressed decked bulb T beams with CFCC <b>stirrups.</b> The investigation addresses {{the effect of the}} shear-span-to-depth (a/d) ratio and the type of transverse reinforcement on the shear carrying capacity. Four 9. 45 -m-long beams reinforced and prestressed with CFCC reinforcement were constructed and tested under shear loading to failure. Half of the span of each test beam was reinforced with CFCC <b>stirrups</b> and the other half was reinforced with steel <b>stirrups.</b> To assess the performance of CFCC <b>stirrups</b> versus that of steel <b>stirrups,</b> both ends of each beam were tested under identical shear load. The obtained experimental results were compared with developed finite element (FE) models to validate the results. Beam ends with CFCC <b>stirrups</b> failed due to either concrete web crushing or top concrete compression failure, while beam ends with steel <b>stirrups</b> failed in shear tension mode due to yielding of <b>stirrups.</b> The developed FE models predicted the shear behavior and capacity of the test beams with a difference of less than 10 %. This investigation demonstrates that CFCC <b>stirrups</b> can be regarded as a non-corrosive alternative to steel <b>stirrups</b> in highway bridge girders...|$|R
5|$|The {{development}} of equestrian technology proceeded {{at a similar}} pace as the {{development of}} horse breeding and utilisation.

5|$|During the Late Mycenaean period (1400–1200 BC), Mycenaean vessels/pottery {{exhibited}} similarities spanning {{a significant}} {{area of the}} Eastern Mediterranean (i.e., from the Levant to Sicily) and possibly reflecting a form {{of economic and political}} union centered at Mycenae. However, the pottery of Crete during this time remained distinct indicating a degree of autonomy on the island. The Mycenaean Greeks produced in large quantities a variety of diversely-styled vessels such as <b>stirrup</b> jars, large bowls, alabastron, krater and stemmed cups (or kylikes) resembling champagne glasses.|$|E
5|$|Dannatt {{was raised}} from Knight Commander to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) in the 2008–2009 New Year Honours List. His tenure as CGS expired in August 2008 {{and he was}} succeeded {{for the last time}} by Sir David Richards. The {{government}} took the unusual decision to extend the tenure of Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock <b>Stirrup</b> as CDS, rather than promote one of the outgoing service chiefs. Thus all three, including Dannatt, retired, amid claims that Dannatt's potential promotion to CDS had been personally vetoed by Prime Minister Gordon Brown. His last act as CGS was to nominate Nick Houghton to become the next Vice-Chief of the Defence Staff.|$|E
40|$|Although {{extensive}} research on steel corrosion in concrete has been undertaken {{it is more}} on longitudinal reinforcing bars than <b>stirrups</b> as suggested in the review of published literature. The effect of corrosion of steel <b>stirrups</b> on structural behaviour can be significant for shear failure mode. This paper aims to investigate the degradation of mechanical behaviour of corroded <b>stirrups.</b> Details of a comprehensive experiment designed to examine the mechanical behaviour of corroded <b>stirrups</b> in concrete structural members are presented. A micromechanical damage model for failure mechanism of corroded <b>stirrups</b> is proposed and a model for damage factor is derived. Based on these models, a constitutive model for corroded <b>stirrups</b> is developed and verified with test results. It {{is found in the}} experiment that both the strength and ductility of corroded <b>stirrups</b> decrease with the increase of corrosion and that the hemispherical model for the pit shape is more appropriate for the prediction of strength reduction of corroded <b>stirrups.</b> The constitutive model developed in the paper can be used to predict the mechanical behaviour of corroded <b>stirrups</b> with reasonable accuracy, paving the way for the assessment of corrosion induced shear failure of reinforced concrete structures...|$|R
40|$|Fracture of {{reinforcements}} due to concrete expansion {{has been}} reported on some bridge piers affected by the alkali silica reaction in Japan. This failure is found mainly at bent corners of <b>stirrups</b> in RC structures. However, {{little is known about}} its adverse effect on their load carrying capacity. RC beams with <b>stirrups</b> cut off at bent corners were tested to investigate their shear resisting mechanism. The test results indicated that the shear capacity of RC beams with damaged <b>stirrups</b> was reduced by approximately 20 %; this reduction was induced by a decrease in the shear strength provided by not only <b>stirrups</b> but also concrete. In addition, the strength contribution by concrete and <b>stirrups</b> varied depending on the location of their damage. The loss of confinement due to <b>stirrups</b> cut off at tensile side made it difficult to sustain the truss action, but contributed {{to the development of the}} arch action. Meanwhile, <b>stirrups</b> cut off at compressive side failed to develop the arch action...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. High {{strength}} concrete and high strength reinforcement technology {{have been quite}} mature,but there are still less in practical application of china. CRB 550 grade reinforcement is formed by HPB 235 reinforcement through cold-working, which strength is much improved,but ductility did not change much. 6 reinforced concrete beams with different <b>stirrups</b> are designed for low cyclic loading test. Contrasting the test results, in the elastic stage, beam with CRB 550 <b>stirrups</b> and beam with HPB 235 <b>stirrups</b> is very similar in bearing capacity and deformation performance. However, in the elastic-plastic stage, beam with CRB 550 <b>stirrups</b> in bearing capacity and deformation performance is better than beam with HPB 235 <b>stirrups.</b> Therefore, it is proved that CRB 550 reinforcement can replace HPB 235 reinforcement as <b>stirrups</b> in RC beams...|$|R
5|$|The {{design was}} rather {{different}} to von Haschenperg's first castle. The keep and the <b>stirrup</b> towers {{were raised in}} height, {{the level of the}} floors elevated, the curtain wall was strengthened, the old bastions entirely removed and four new, larger bastions added in their place, while the older foreworks around the castle were demolished. The keep's flat roof was altered to a pitched design, and the guns that it had supported moved into the outlying bastions. Although the size of the castle had slightly decreased, the new design had much more domestic space available for the garrison.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle ear}} lies between the outer ear {{and the inner}} ear. It {{consists}} of an air-filled cavity called the tympanic cavity and includes the three ossicles and their attaching ligaments; the auditory tube; and the round and oval windows. The ossicles are three small bones that function together to receive, amplify, and transmit the sound from the eardrum to the inner ear. The ossicles are the malleus (hammer), incus (anvil), and the stapes (<b>stirrup).</b> The stapes is the smallest named bone in the body. The middle ear also connects to the upper throat at the nasopharynx via the pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube.|$|E
5|$|Two major {{innovations}} that revolutionised {{the effectiveness of}} mounted warriors in battle were the saddle and the <b>stirrup.</b> Riders quickly learned to pad their horse's backs {{to protect themselves from}} the horse's spine and withers, and fought on horseback for centuries with little more than a blanket or pad on the horse's back and a rudimentary bridle. To help distribute the rider's weight and protect the horse's back, some cultures created stuffed padding that resembles the panels of today's English saddle. Both the Scythians and Assyrians used pads with added felt attached with a surcingle or girth around the horse's barrel for increased security and comfort. Xenophon mentioned the use of a padded cloth on cavalry mounts as early as the 4th century BC.|$|E

5|$|During {{the later}} Roman Empire, the {{principal}} military developments were attempts {{to create an}} effective cavalry force {{as well as the}} continued development of highly specialised types of troops. The creation of heavily armoured cataphract-type soldiers as cavalry was an important feature of the 5th-century Roman military. The various invading tribes had differing emphasis on types of soldiers—ranging from the primarily infantry Anglo-Saxon invaders of Britain to the Vandals and Visigoths, who had a high proportion of cavalry in their armies. During the early invasion period, the <b>stirrup</b> had not been introduced into warfare, which limited the usefulness of cavalry as shock troops because {{it was not possible to}} put the full force of the horse and rider behind blows struck by the rider. The greatest change in military affairs during the invasion period was the adoption of the Hunnic composite bow in place of the earlier, and weaker, Scythian composite bow. Another development was the increasing use of longswords and the progressive replacement of scale armour by mail armour and lamellar armour.|$|E
5|$|Initially the old {{tower was}} {{converted}} into a stronger keep which was able to support artillery guns on its roof, a gatehouse was built alongside it, four <b>stirrup</b> towers – so-called because of their shape – a curtain wall was constructed around {{the outside of the}} castle, and bastions erected around the wall. Towards the end of this phase of work the castle was altered in a frantic burst of work, possibly driven on by pressure from the King himself. The height of the curtain wall was increased, the gatehouse extended into an entrance bastion, a new network of underground passages installed, and foreworks added around the outside of the bastions. By the end of 1540 the castle was garrisoned with 17 men and equipped with artillery, with Chute appointed as its captain.|$|E
5000|$|The Mongolian saddle, both {{medieval and}} modern, has short <b>stirrups</b> rather like {{those used by}} modern race horses.

50|$|<b>Stirrups</b> {{form the}} outer part of a rebar cage. <b>Stirrups</b> are usually rectangular, and are placed at regular {{intervals}} along a column or beam to prevent shear failure.|$|R
40|$|A {{convenient}} and proven technique {{for increasing the}} vertical shear capacity of reinforced concrete beams is to externally bond fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) {{to the sides of}} the beam with the fibres orientated in the transverse or vertical direction. The FRP, which can be in the form of pultruded plates or applied in the wet lay-up procedure, acts as external FRP <b>stirrups</b> resisting vertical shear {{in the same way as}} the conventional internal steel <b>stirrups.</b> However, internal steel <b>stirrups</b> are ductile as they are both fully anchored and can yield, which is in contrast to external FRP <b>stirrups</b> that can debond in a brittle fashion and do not yield. Hence, there is no guarantee that the peak vertical shear forces that can be resisted by the steel <b>stirrups</b> and by the transverse FRP plates coincide. In this paper, a partial-interaction model has been developed that quantifies the vertical shear interaction between transverse FRP plates and steel <b>stirrups.</b> M. S. Mohamed Ali, D. J.

5|$|The {{first use}} of horses in warfare {{occurred}} over 5,000 years ago. The earliest evidence of horses ridden in warfare dates from Eurasia between 4000 and 3000BC. A Sumerian illustration of warfare from 2500BC depicts some type of equine pulling wagons. By 1600BC, improved harness and chariot designs made chariot warfare common throughout the Ancient Near East, and the earliest written training manual for war horses was a guide for training chariot horses written about 1350BC. As formal cavalry tactics replaced the chariot, so did new training methods, and by 360BC, the Greek cavalry officer Xenophon had written an extensive treatise on horsemanship. The effectiveness of horses in battle was also revolutionized by improvements in technology, including {{the invention of the}} saddle, the <b>stirrup,</b> and later, the horse collar.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of infantry and light cavalry {{began to decline}} during the early Carolingian period, with a growing dominance of elite heavy cavalry. The use of militia-type levies of the free population declined over the Carolingian period. Although much of the Carolingian armies were mounted, a large proportion during the early period {{appear to have been}} mounted infantry, rather than true cavalry. One exception was Anglo-Saxon England, where the armies were still composed of regional levies, known as the fyrd, which were led by the local elites. In military technology, one of the main changes was the return of the crossbow, which had been known in Roman times and reappeared as a military weapon during {{the last part of the}} Early Middle Ages. Another change was the introduction of the <b>stirrup,</b> which increased the effectiveness of cavalry as shock troops. A technological advance that had implications beyond the military was the horseshoe, which allowed horses to be used in rocky terrain.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{retirement}} of Sir Mike Jackson, Dannatt was appointed Chief of the General Staff (CGS)—the professional head of the British Army—on 29 August 2006. Concerned that {{the formation of the}} British Armed Forces Federation meant that soldiers were losing confidence in generals to lobby on their behalf, his first act as CGS was to write a long letter to the Secretary of State for Defence, Des Browne, which he copied to the MoD's senior civil servant, Bill Jeffrey; Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock <b>Stirrup,</b> Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS); and to the First Sea Lord and Chief of the Air Staff—his opposite numbers in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force respectively. In the letter, he asserted his view that the Army was over-stretched by operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and that essential equipment, such as helicopters, was unavailable or ineffective and outdated, like the Snatch Land Rover. He also raised concerns with the standard of accommodation provided for soldiers at home and with soldiers' wages. The following weekend, he travelled to Afghanistan on his first official visit as CGS. He met Des Browne in person for the first time two days after becoming CGS and later acknowledged the difficulties faced by defence secretaries in the little time they have to prepare for the role.|$|E
40|$|There is {{a growing}} need for {{reliable}} methods of assessing the load-carrying capacity and remaining service life of corroded structures. Previous research has been mainly concerned with lower corrosion levels leading to cover cracking. Moreover, {{the main focus of}} the available knowledge concerns the corrosion of the main reinforcement; while the corrosion of the <b>stirrups</b> is often overlooked. Therefore, these two uncertainties; i. e. high amount of corrosion leading to extensive cover cracking and spalling and the effect of corroding <b>stirrups,</b> were investigated in an experimental program. Pull-out tests were carried out on eccentrically reinforced specimens with long embedment length to study the anchorage capacity of a corroded bar. The influences of the location of the anchored bar, i. e. middle or corner placement; {{the presence or absence of}} transverse reinforcement; the corrosion level of longitudinal reinforcement and the corrosion of transverse reinforcement were studied. The specimens were of three types in relation to the reinforcement arrangement and corrosion: specimens without <b>stirrups,</b> where the main bars were corroded (type A); specimens with <b>stirrups</b> where the main bars were corroded and the <b>stirrups</b> were protected by insulating tape (type B); and specimens with <b>stirrups</b> where the main bars and <b>stirrups</b> were corroded (type C). All of the specimens were subjected to accelerated corrosion, with an average current density of 100 µA/cm 2, for three time spans that caused a rebar weight loss up to approximately 20 % in the main bars and 35 % in the <b>stirrups.</b> All of the specimens showed longitudinal cracks along the main bars for relatively low corrosion levels. The corrosion level at first cracking was about 0. 6 % 1. 0 % corrosion weight loss; the cracks widened with increased corrosion levels. Crack patterns formed depended on the presence or absence of <b>stirrups</b> and whether the <b>stirrups</b> were corroded. The crack patterns showed differences between specimens with or without <b>stirrups</b> and when <b>stirrups</b> are corroding or not. The tests showed an important effect of the cover cracking in terms of loss of confinement. They also indicated that the bond behaviour and the failure were strongly governed by the position of the anchored bar, i. e. corner or middle positions, and the level of the corrosion attack. <b>Stirrups</b> played an important role after cover cracking, as they then became the primary source of confinement. The knowledge gained in this study contributes to better understanding of the effects of deterioration on structures...|$|R

25|$|There are {{two basic}} methods of using stirrups, a shorter <b>stirrup</b> to allow more {{mobility}} and a longer <b>stirrup</b> to allow greater control. The <b>stirrup</b> itself is similar, but {{the length of the}} <b>stirrup</b> leather is different. In each case, the <b>stirrup</b> length allows the rider to remain over the center of balance of the horse for the average speed characteristic of the discipline; the faster the horse travels, the more forward the rider must be positioned, and hence the shorter the <b>stirrup.</b>|$|E

25|$|While an inexperienced rider {{may feel}} more secure with a {{slightly}} too-short <b>stirrup,</b> in reality, it is actually easier to be thrown from the horse because the rider's legs act as a stabilizing agent, much {{in the same way}} the long pole of a tightrope walker balances the acrobat. Obviously, a <b>stirrup</b> leather so long that a rider cannot reach it is useless, and a <b>stirrup</b> length that does not allow a rider with a properly positioned leg to keep the heel lower than the toe is also easily lost. However, shortening the <b>stirrup</b> until the rider feels they will not lose the <b>stirrup</b> is counterproductive; the goal of correct equestrianism is to make maximum use of the leg. Lengthening the leg creates a more secure seat, while shortening the <b>stirrup</b> is done only to accommodate the needs of the horse to perform athletic movement. Thus correct <b>stirrup</b> length creates a balance between control and mobility that fits the discipline performed.|$|E
