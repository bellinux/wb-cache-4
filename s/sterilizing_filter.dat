30|$|For all mock labellings, we {{observed}} a bioburden of < 10  cfu/ml (no growth) and endotoxin content of < 0.125  IU/ml. This endotoxin content is {{far below the}} threshold of 175  IU/V ml (see before). When considering these results together with the specifications of the <b>sterilizing</b> <b>filter</b> used, we conclude that the pre filter bioburden is far below the maximum capacity of the filter. The Cathivex® GV filter (Millipore) used for on-line sterile filtration employs the Millipore Durapore® 0.22 -μm membrane which is validated to withstand a challenge with 4.0 [*]×[*] 107 of the micro-organism Brevundimonas diminuta. These numbers are even {{much higher than the}} worst-case bioburden of 300  cfu/ml observed after leaving the 68 Ge/ 68 Ga generator stagnant for 1  month (see before). Based on this validation work and evaluation, we consider that a routine analysis of bioburden or bacterial endotoxins is not warranted except for a successful filter integrity test as a release criterium. This approach is also supported by the successful validation of the aseptic process showing no bacterial growth after incubation of the media in any of the three simulation experiments. According to the GMP principles, this aseptic validation will need to be repeated biannually together with a personal aseptic qualification of all technicians.|$|E

The Intravenous Fluid Generation (IVGEN) Experiment demonstrated the purification of ISS potable water, the mixing of the purified water with sodium chloride, and sterilization of the solution via membrane filtration. On-orbit performance was monitored where feasible and two 1. 5 -liter bags of normal saline solution were returned to earth for post-flight testing by a FDA-registered laboratory for compliance with United States Pharmacopeia (USP) standards [1]. Current efforts have been focused on challenge testing with identified [2] impurities (total organic-carbon), and shelf life testing. The challenge testing flowed known concentrations of contaminants through the IVGEN deionizing cartridge and membrane filters to test their effectiveness. One finding was that the filters and DI-resin themselves contribute to the contaminant load during initial startup, suggesting that the first 100 ml of fluid be discarded. Shelf life testing is ongoing and involves periodic testing of stored DI cartridges and membrane filters that are capped and sealed in hermetic packages. The testing is conducted at six month intervals measuring conductivity and endotoxins in the effluent. Currently, the packaging technique has been successfully demonstrated for one year of storage testing. The USP standards specifies that the TOC be conducted at point of generation as opposed to point of consumption. Samples were generated and shipped to an FDA facility however, testing determined that the samples failed the TOC specification with most likely due to leaching from the sample container.

Samples were mixed to get a composite sample and stored at 4  °C (Mahmood et al. 2013). The isolates were isolated using enrichment culture technique from tannery effluent samples (Sharma and Adholeya 2012). Chromium resistant and tannic acid degrading fungi were isolated separately. 10  mL effluent was enriched in 100  mL potato dextrose broth (PDB, pH 5.5) amended with 50  mg/L (50  ppm) <b>filter</b> <b>sterilized</b> K 2 Cr 2 O 7 (Potassium dichromate) as Cr(VI) source and 0.1 % <b>filter</b> <b>sterilized</b> tannic acid (as described by Chhokar et al. 2010), followed by incubation at 30  °C for 120  h at 120  rpm. After incubation, resistant fungi were isolated by serial dilution followed by spread plate technique on potato dextrose agar plates amended with 50  mg/L (50  ppm) Cr(VI) and 1  mg/mL (0.1 %) tannic acid. The strain was sub-cultured at an interval of 4 – 5  weeks and routinely maintained on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) slants under refrigerated conditions.|$|R
