40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} an analysis in attachment spacing of tower cranes. Both the <b>support</b> <b>spacing</b> under the rigid {{support and the}} flexible support are obtained for this purpose. For deriving the rigid <b>support</b> <b>spacing,</b> differential equation is used. The principle is used for calculating the <b>support</b> <b>spacing,</b> which the extended segment has the same Euler critical force with the independent segment. The flexible support distance is obtained by setting the integrated stiffness matrix zero, which is equivalent to structural instability. The order of the overall stiffness matrix is big when the tower crane is attached many times. In order to calculate more convenient for solving the matrix determinant, a transfer matrix method is adopted. To verify {{the influence of the}} flexibility caused by the support device, an example is carried out by both rigid and flexible support situations for this purpose, and the <b>support</b> <b>spacing</b> is computed numerically. Numerical results for the support distances of a tower crane will be presented and discussed...|$|R

2500|$|The 821st Main Space Intelligence Centre (...) is the {{headquarters}} of the Russian military's space surveillance network, SKKP. The centre is part of the Russian Space Forces and receives intelligence from a network of reporting stations which includes the Russian missile attack early warning network as well as some stations only used for space surveillance such as Okno and Krona. The purpose of SKKP is to detect satellites, identify them and to discern their orbits. It maintains the Russian catalogue of space objects and provides data which could be used to <b>support</b> <b>space</b> launches, feed an anti-satellite programme and provide intelligence on hostile military satellites. It is the Russian equivalent of the United States Space Surveillance Network.|$|E
2500|$|The Texas Medical Center is the city's {{healthcare}} and biotechnology focal point with $3.5 billion committed to research grants from 2000 through 2004, more than 43 member institutions, 5.2 million patient visits in 2004.

The transportation vehicle {{was assumed to be}} a hydrogen/oxygen propulsion design with or without large aerobrakes and assembled and checked out on the LEO Space Station. The long transit time necessitated artificial gravity of the crew by rotating the crew compartments. This rotation complicates power source selection. Candidate power sources were examined for the Lander, Mars Orbiter, <b>supporting</b> <b>Space</b> Station, co-orbiting Propellant Storage Depot, and alternatively, a co-orbiting Propellant Generation (water electrolysis) Depot. Candidates considered were photovoltaics with regenerative fuel cells or batteries, solar dynamics, isotope dynamics, and nuclear power...|$|R
