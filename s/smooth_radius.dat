40|$|We {{present a}} new fast and {{efficient}} approach to model structure formation with Augmented Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (ALPT). Our method {{is based on}} splitting the displacement field into a long and a short-range component. The long-range component is computed by second order LPT (2 LPT). This approximation contains a tidal nonlocal and nonlinear term. Unfortunately, 2 LPT fails on small scales due to severe shell crossing and a crude quadratic behaviour in the low density regime. The spherical collapse (SC) approximation has been recently reported to correct for both effects by adding an ideal collapse truncation. However, this approach fails to reproduce the structures on large scales where it is significantly less correlated with the N-body result than 2 LPT or linear LPT (the Zeldovich approximation). We propose to combine both approximations using for the short-range displacement field the SC solution. A Gaussian filter with a <b>smoothing</b> <b>radius</b> r_S is used to separate between both regimes. We use the result of 25 dark matter only N-body simulations to benchmark at z= 0 the different approximations: 1 st, 2 nd, 3 rd order LPT, SC and our novel combined ALPT model. This comparison demonstrates that our method improves previous approximations at all scales showing ~ 25 % and ~ 75 % higher correlation than 2 LPT with the N-body solution at k = 1 and 2 h Mpc^- 1, respectively.

In the Amazon drainage basin, for a 106 in <b>smoothing</b> <b>radius</b> and GRACE gravity field coefficients truncated to degree and order 15, the annual amplitude of average water storage variation thickness is about 15. 6 x 10 (- 2) m, smaller than 23. 7 x 10 (- 2) in for a 4 x 10 (5) M <b>smoothing</b> <b>radius.</b> When we study the water storage variation in the Yangtse drainage basin, we expand the hydrological data in spherical harmonic coefficients, and dispose them of truncation and smoothness as same as GRACE data.

In this paper, various methods used for discretization of second-order spatial derivatives are investigated in the context of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics. Three popular forms (i. e. ”double summation”, ”second-order kernel derivation”, and ”difference scheme”) are studied using one-dimensional unsteady heat conduction equation. To assess these schemes, transient response to a step function initial condition is considered. Due to parabolic nature of the heat equation, one can expect smooth and monotone solutions. It is shown, however in this paper, that regardless of the type of kernel function used and the size of <b>smoothing</b> <b>radius,</b> the double summation discretization form leads to non-physical oscillations which persist in the solution. Also, results show that when a second-order kernel derivative is used, a high-order kernel function shall be employed {{in such a way that}} the distance of inflection point from origin in the kernel function be less than the nearest particle distance. Otherwise, solutions may exhibit oscillations near discontinuities unlike the ”difference scheme ” which unconditionally produces monotone results...|$|R
40|$|Subject of {{this paper}} is a {{detailed}} analysis of the PINOCCHIO algorithm for studying the relative velocity statistics of merging haloes in Lagrangian perturbation theory. Given a cosmological background model, a power spectrum of fluctuations as well as a Gaussian linear density contrast field δ_ l is generated on a cubic grid, which is then smoothed repeatedly with Gaussian filters. For each Lagrangian particle at position q and each <b>smoothing</b> <b>radius</b> R, the collapse time, the velocities and ellipsoidal truncation are computed using Lagrangian Perturbation Theory. The collapsed medium is then fragmented into isolated objects by an algorithm designed to mimic the accretion and merger events of hierarchical collapse. Directly after the fragmentation process the mass function, merger histories of haloes and the statistics of the relative velocities at merging are evaluated. We reimplemented the algorithm in C++, recovered the mass function and optimised the construction of halo merging histories. Comparing our results with the output of the Millennium simulation suggests that PINOCCHIO is well suited for studying relative velocities of merging haloes and is able to reproduce the pairwise velocity distribution.

40|$|We {{perform a}} variety of tests to {{determine}} the numerical resolution of the cosmological TVD eulerian code developed by Ryu et al (1993). Tests include 512 ^ 3 and 256 ^ 3 simulations of a Pk=k^- 1 spectrum to check for self-similarity and comparison of results with those from higher resolution SPH and grid-based calculations (Frenk et al 1998). We conclude that in regions where density gradients are not produced by shocks the code degrades resolution with a Gaussian <b>smoothing</b> (<b>radius)</b> length of 1. 7 cells. At shock caused gradients (for which the code was designed) the smoothing length is 1. 1 cells. Finally, for β model fit clusters, we can approximately correct numerical resolution by the transformation R^ 2 _core→ R^ 2 _core-(CΔ l) ^ 2, where previously published computations for the SCDM and Λ CDM models we find luminosity weighted, zero redshift, X-ray cluster core radii of (210 ± 86, 280 ± 67) h^- 1 kpc, respectively, which are marginally consistent with observed (Jones & Forman 1992) values of 50 - 200 h^- 1 kpc. Using the corrected core radii, the COBE normalized SCDM model predicts the number of bright L_x> 10 ^ 43 erg/s clusters too high {{by a factor of}} ∼ 20 and the Λ CDM model is consistent with observations...|$|R
