5000|$|The {{most common}} {{fall arrest system}} is the {{vertical}} lifeline: a <b>stranded</b> <b>rope</b> that is connected to an anchor above, and to which the user's PPE is attached either directly or through a [...] "shock absorbing" [...] (energy absorbing) lanyard. Once all {{of the components of}} the particular lifeline system meet the requirements of the standard, the anchor connection is then referred to as an anchorage, and the system as well as the rope is then called a [...] "lifeline".|$|E
50|$|Half knots {{are tied}} {{alternately}} behind {{and in front}} of the rope until the width of the band of twine approaches the diameter of the rope. A reef (square) knot, or better a series of reef (square) knots, completes the whipping. If a needle is available this string of reef (square) knots can be pulled through the rope to bury the ends. Alternatively, a short bight of another rope can be laid first and used to pull the rope ends through. If the rope is a <b>stranded</b> <b>rope,</b> the ends can usually be pulled through without a needle.|$|E
50|$|The {{height of}} the shell attains 7 mm. The conical shell is elevated, with a rather obtuse apex. It is shining and pearly white. It {{contains}} five whorls. The nucleus is translucent, white, and with a sculpture of strong revolving threads, of which that nearest to the suture is most pronounced, and continues, at first sharp, then with slight waves, then with oblique waves like the lay of a <b>stranded</b> <b>rope.</b> On the body whorl there is a succession of well-elevated pinched-up points forming a band next the suture. The others disappear on the third whorl, {{and for the rest}} the shell is only marked by faint lines of growth here and there, a little more pronounced {{in the vicinity of the}} umbilical callus. The periphery has a tendency to carination. The base of the shell is rounded. The oblique aperture is rounded with a sharp margin. The simple columella is stout, thick, inseparable from a thick white callus which forms a lump over the umbilical pit. The end of the columella (broken in specimens seen so far) apparently form a sort of lump or thickened angle. The suture is distinct throughout.|$|E
40|$|Six <b>strand</b> <b>ropes</b> {{generate}} torque under tension. This {{can lead}} to transfer of twist to other mooring line components, either permanently, or dynamically. The effects of this imposed twist can seriously affect strength and fatigue endurance. In order to predict the torsional interactions between components {{it is necessary to}} quantify the tension/torsion behavior of all the different categories of mooring line component, not just the six <b>strand</b> <b>rope.</b> This paper discusses the problems of torsional interaction and presents results of measurements of tension/torsion behavior of six <b>strand</b> <b>rope,</b> stud link chain and a PET fiber rope...|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, a three <b>strand</b> laid <b>rope</b> {{is called}} a plain- or hawser-laid, a four <b>strand</b> <b>rope</b> is called shroud-laid, and a larger rope formed by counter-twisting three or more {{multi-strand}} ropes together is called cable-laid.|$|R

50|$|<b>Stranded</b> <b>ropes</b> are an {{assembly}} of several strands laid helically {{in one or}} more layers around a core. This core can be one of three types. The first is a fiber core, made up of synthetic material or natural fibers like Sysal. Synthetic fibers are stronger and more uniform but can't absorb much lubricant, natural fibers can absorb up to 15% of their weight in lubricant and so protect the inner wires much better from corrosion than synthetic fibers do. Fiber cores are the most flexible and elastic, but have the downside of getting crushed easily. The second type, wire strand core, is made up of one additional strand of wire, and is typically used for suspension. The third type is independent wire rope core (IWRC), which is the most durable in all types of environments. Most types of <b>stranded</b> <b>ropes</b> only have one strand layer over the core (fibre core or steel core). The lay direction of the <b>strands</b> in the <b>rope</b> can be right (symbol Z) or left (symbol S) and the lay direction of the wires can be right (symbol z) or left (symbol s). This kind of rope is called ordinary lay rope if the lay direction of the wires in the outer strands is in the opposite direction to the lay of the outer strands themselves. If both the wires in the outer strands and the outer strands themselves have the same lay direction, the rope is called a lang lay rope (formerly Albert’s lay or Lang’s lay). Regular lay means the individual wires were wrapped around the centers in one direction and the strands were wrapped around the core in the opposite direction.|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- Wire ropes are {{critical}} mechanical components in mining and other industries where hoisting is common. Most of the industries follow the replenishment criteria {{based on the}} conventional practices. Some research {{has been carried out}} on analysis of wire ropes and the FE approach is also reported by some researchers in the recent past. This paper presents a study carried out on simple 7 wire single <b>strand</b> <b>rope</b> using the analytical as well as FE approach. The results obtained are compared. It is concluded that the behavior is significantly altered when rotation of the wire rope is allowed and when the rotation is prevented. Each case has been analyzed and presented...|$|R

40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines {{established}} a wire rope research laboratory {{to examine the}} factors that affect the safety and the useful life of wire rope. In the most recent work, two 32 -mm 6 x 27 H flattened <b>strand</b> <b>ropes</b> were degraded on a bending fatigue machine. The two tests were run at constant loads of 285 and 347 kN or safety factors of 2. 5 and 2. Nondestructive and tensile strength tests were performed on samples of the ropes to determine the relationship between rope deterioration and rope breaking strength. Neither the area loss nor the number of broken wires measured from nondestructive tests {{could be used as}} clear indicators of the loss of strength. However, it was found from the tensile tests for both rope specimens that the strength loss was associated with the reduction of breaking strain. This suggests that measuring the strain of many short sections of a rope in the elastic region may locate the high stress sections and thus delermine the condition of the rope...|$|R
