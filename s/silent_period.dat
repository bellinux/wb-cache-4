5|$|During {{the next}} seven years, 1870–1877, only two works of the painter's were exhibited. These were two water-colours, shown at the Dudley Gallery in 1873, one of them being the {{beautiful}} Love among the Ruins, destroyed twenty years later by a cleaner who supposed {{it to be an}} oil painting, but afterwards reproduced in oils by the painter. This <b>silent</b> <b>period</b> was, however, one of unremitting production. Hitherto Burne-Jones had worked almost entirely in water-colours. He now began a number of large pictures in oils, working at them in turn, and having always several on hand. The first Briar Rose series, Laus Veneris, the Golden Stairs, the Pygmalion series, and The Mirror of Venus are among the works planned and completed, or carried far towards completion, during these years. These years also mark the beginnings of Burne-Jones's partnership with the fine-art photographer Frederick Hollyer, whose reproductions of paintings and—especially—drawings would expose a wider audience to Burne-Jones's works in the coming decades.|$|E

60|$|There {{is another}} thing to be considered. I believe that the bird, like creatures in other classes, has his {{receptive}} period, his time to learn, and that, like some mammals, he learns everything {{he needs to know}} in his first year or two; and that, having acquired his proper song, he adds little or nothing to it thereafter, although the song may increase in power and brilliance when the bird comes to full maturity. This, I think, holds true of all birds, like the nightingale, which have a singing period of two or three months and are songless {{for the rest of the}} year. That long, <b>silent</b> <b>period</b> cannot, so far as sounds go, be a receptive one; the song early in life has become crystallized in the form it will keep through life, and is like an intuitive act. This is not the case with birds like the starling, that sing all the year round--birds that are naturally loquacious and sing instead of screaming and chirping like others. They are always borrowing new sounds and always forgetting.|$|E

6000|$|In {{his state}} of moral decomposition, Schomberg, master as he was {{of the art of}} hotel-keeping, and careful of giving no {{occasion}} for criticism to the powers regulating that branch of human activity, let things take their course; though he saw very well where that course was tending. It began first with a game or two after dinner--for the drinks, apparently--with some lingering customer, at one of the little tables ranged against the walls of the billiard-room. Schomberg detected the meaning of it at once. [...] "That's what it was! This was what they were!" [...] And, moving about restlessly (at that time his morose <b>silent</b> <b>period</b> had set in), he cast sidelong looks at the game; but he said nothing. It was not worth while having a row with men who were so overbearing. Even when money appeared in connection with these postprandial games, into which more and more people were being drawn, he still refrained from raising the question; he was reluctant to draw unduly the attention of [...] "plain Mr. Jones" [...] and of the equivocal Ricardo, to his person. One evening, however, after the public rooms of the hotel had become empty, Schomberg made an attempt to grapple with the problem in an indirect way.|$|E
50|$|Haynes {{divided the}} process of second-language {{acquisition}} into five stages: preproduction, early production, speech emergence, intermediate fluency, and advanced fluency. The first stage, preproduction, {{is also known as}} the <b>silent</b> <b>period.</b> Learners at this stage have a receptive vocabulary of up to 500 words, but they do not yet speak their second language. Not all learners go through a <b>silent</b> <b>period.</b> Some learners start speaking straight away, although their output may consist of imitation rather than creative language use. Others may be required to speak from the start as part of a language course. For learners that do go through a <b>silent</b> <b>period,</b> it may last around three to six months.|$|E

40|$|This study {{addresses}} mandatory non-trading periods for Swedish {{stock market}} participants which have implemented an open-market share repurchase program {{during the period}} 2000 until 2010. By locating the date of publication of interim reports, these mandatory non-trading <b>periods</b> called <b>silent</b> <b>periods</b> are examined. The result indicates that repurchase trading activity occurs despite the statutory prohibition. By studying the price support hypothesis assumptions about long- and short-term effect on share price and performance, this study tries to explain these tendencies. An average decline of share price and performance is shown among companies entering <b>silent</b> <b>periods.</b> However, the price support effect is small and only occasionally significant; making it unlikely that open-market repurchase activity is driven by pricesupport decisions only. Consistent with claims that stock price affects the stock volatility, this study shows that different priced shares react differently to <b>silent</b> <b>periods.</b> Most of the repurchase programs where initiated during recessions in the early 2000 s and year 2007, which confirms previous theories that repurchase program follows the cyclical changes of business economy...|$|R

40|$|We {{evaluated}} motor responses evoked after magnetic cortical stimulation in dystonia, {{emphasizing the}} relationship between resting and facilitation state. We studied 15 normal controls (mean age, 37. 9 years; range, 23 to 63) and 13 dystonic patients (mean age, 43. 4 years; range, 20 to 56). Surface electrodes were placed over the right first dorsal interosseous muscle to measure motor evoked potentials and inhibitory <b>silent</b> <b>periods</b> obtained with magnetic stimulation. The amplitude ratio of motor evoked potentials measured during facilitation and at rest with low-intensity magnetic stimulation was significantly higher in dystonic patients (15. 09) when compared with normal subjects (5. 43; p = 0. 04). The ratio of duration of <b>silent</b> <b>periods</b> evoked with 120 % motor threshold (MT) and MT + 25 % magnetic stimulus intensity was significantly higher in dystonic patients (78. 4 %) when compared with normal subjects (69. 7 %; p = 0. 04). We conclude that with low-intensity magnetic stimulation {{the relationship between}} amplitudes of motor potentials evoked at rest and during facilitation, {{as well as the}} responses of pathways that mediate <b>silent</b> <b>periods,</b> are disturbed in focal dystonia.

40|$|Isolated rat neural lobes were stimulated {{electrically}} and {{the release}} of vasopressin and oxytocin was measured by radioimmunoassay. The neurohypophyses were stimulated with pulses given at a constant frequency or with a pulse pattern imitating the electrical activity, recorded in vivo, of vasopressin- or oxytocin-containing magnocellular neurones. A single burst recorded from a 'vasopressin' cell with an intraburst mean frequency of 13 Hz evoked more vasopressin release than the same number of stimuli delivered at a constant frequency of 13 Hz. The amount of vasopressin release per pulse was much higher at the beginning than {{at the end of the}} burst. Series of bursts given with interburst <b>silent</b> <b>periods</b> released more hormone than bursts delivered without <b>silent</b> <b>periods.</b> The amount of hormone released by four 'vasopressin' bursts was significantly larger with <b>silent</b> <b>periods</b> of 21 s than with shorter intervals. Four pulses were much more effective in promoting hormone release when given with 60 ms interspike intervals at the beginning of each second than when delivered at a constant frequency of 4 Hz. Prolonged stimulation with 'vasopressin' bursts had a greater effect in inducing hormone release than the same number of pulses given in burst delivered at a constant frequency of 13 Hz. After an initial increase the rate of vasopressin release declined rapidly whereas oxytocin release remained elevated for the first 20 min and only then decreased. The release of both vasopressin and oxytocin remained, however, above the release from unstimulated neurohypophyses. 45 Ca uptake in the neural lobe was larger when the neurohypophyses were stimulated with vasopressin or oxytocin bursts delivered with silent intervals than when the <b>silent</b> <b>periods</b> were omitted, or when the tissue was stimulated with bursts with the same number of pulses but given at a constant frequency of 13 Hz. In conclusion, it is suggested that the interspike intervals in a burst and the silent intervals between bursts are two important determinants of the effectiveness of the burst pattern in promoting neuropeptide release...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} silent time in {{the clinical}} consultation: who initiates and terminates it and at what stage most silence occurs. METHODS: We conducted an analysis of 127 multichannel video recordings of consultations by 12 GPs; filmed using the ALFA (Aggregation of Log Files for Analysis) open-source toolkit. The start and end of silence was manually coded using an observational data capture tool. We report who initiates and terminates silence, describe {{the proportion of the}} consultation, what happens within it and the distribution of <b>silent</b> <b>periods</b> by quartile of the consultation. RESULTS: We found the median proportion of silence was 12. 3 % and interquartile range 14. 3 %. <b>Silent</b> <b>periods</b> (52. 4 %) were both initiated and terminated by the doctor. The majority of silent time (78. 1 %) is spent on computer-based activities and physical examination. <b>Silent</b> <b>periods</b> which do not involve physical examination mainly occur {{in the second half of}} the consultation and represent 70. 6 % of the total duration and 64. 8 % of the episodes of silence. CONCLUSIONS: The computer is a third party in the GP consultation and often requires silent time during doctor-computer interaction. Doctors' control and patients allow silence for the doctor to complete tasks often involving the computer and also for time out from the consultation. There is a clear pattern of when doctors need most to have silence and consultation models should be developed that reflect this need...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we first}} propose a {{redundant}} radix based number (RBN) representation for encoding {{the data to}} be transmitted in a wireless network.

We then propose to use <b>silent</b> <b>periods</b> (zero energy transmission) for transmitting the 0 's in the RBN encoded data thus obtained. This is in contrast to most conventional communication strategies that utilize energy based transmission (EbT) schemes, where energy expenditure occurs for transmitting both 0 and 1 bit values.
