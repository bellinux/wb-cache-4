At the end of the day, Ann and Mark (Paul Schneider) arrive to free her, and Leslie finally reveals to Tom the true source of her anxiety—Mark's intentions to marry Ann. Leslie feels emotional confusion over this fact. On the one hand, <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>her</b> friends to be happy. On the other hand, she used to have romantic feelings for Mark, she feels insecure about being single, and she worries about losing her two friends. In response, Tom assures her not to worry, thus empowering Leslie to crash and ruin Jessica's party.|$|E

500|$|Connie Passalacqua of the Herald Journal {{compared}} Victoria's {{scheme to}} reunite {{her parents in}} 1991 to {{the plot of the}} 1961 film The Parent Trap. She wrote, [...] "hat makes Victoria a true terror teen? We venture that it may be the supernatural soap aging by which she aged from 5 to 15 last fall." [...] Fort Worth Star-Telegram criticized Victoria's early romances, saying: [...] "he's divorced, rich and hates sex. And now <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>her</b> husband back. As soap operas go, Victoria Newman's plight...is standard daytime fare. But Victoria has one characteristic that many of her counterparts don't—she is only 17." [...] A syndicated article that appeared in The Fort Oglethorpe Press described Ryan McNeil's attempts to seduce Victoria as [...] "a path that's fraught with peril and which forces the good-natured actor to search hard for inspiration". SoapNet said it was [...] "no surprise" [...] Victoria has a history of [...] "messy relationships" [...] given her parents' history. Lilana Novakovich of the Toronto Star said that Heather Tom made Victoria become [...] "one of her favorite characters" [...] on the soap upon her debut in 1991. The Austin American-Statesman said that Tom was [...] "always a pleasure to watch".|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} debuted at {{number one on}} MTV's TRL on March 2, 2001. The video begins with Spears and her boyfriend in a hammock. Cuts of her cuddling with her love {{interest}} beside a fire are also included. We also see her and her boyfriend on the seashore doing a love scene. Inside a tiki hut, Spears exclaims the words <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>her</b> boyfriend to know. In {{the second half of}} the video, she is seen on a tree where her boyfriend reaches for her. There are also scenes where she is running on the beach and her boyfriend is chasing after her. Spears wears only a bikini top and a pair of cutoff shorts during the whole video. The music video was considered by Spears as [...] "the funnest video I've ever done." [...] An alternate footage of the video can be found on the DVD of Spears first compilation album [...] Vineyard considered the footage as the one that [...] "makes the most use of Britney's body of work, with the spaceman from [...] "Oops!...

500|$|The {{central theme}} in Prometheus {{concerns}} the eponymous Titan of Greek mythology who defies {{the gods and}} gifts humanity with fire, {{for which he is}} subjected to eternal punishment. The gods want to limit their creations in case they attempt to usurp the gods. The film deals with humanity's relationship with the gods—their creators—and the consequence of defying them. A human expedition intends to find God and receive knowledge about belief, immortality and death. They find superior beings who appear god-like in comparison to humanity, and the Prometheus crew suffer consequences for their pursuit. Shaw is directly responsible for the events of the plot because <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>her</b> religious beliefs affirmed, and believes she is entitled to answers from God; her questions remain unanswered and she is punished for her hubris. The film offers similar resolution, providing items of information but leaving the connections and conclusions to the audience, potentially leaving the question unanswered. Further religious allusions are implied by the Engineers' decision to punish humanity with destruction 2,000 years before the events of the film. Scott suggested that an Engineer was sent to Earth to stop humanity's increasing aggression, but was crucified, implying it was Jesus Christ. However, Scott felt that an explicit connection in the film would be [...] "a little too on the nose." ...|$|E
500|$|The team {{breaks into}} TweenLit Inc.'s headquarters, {{planning}} {{to replace the}} new novel with their old version before the mass printing begins. However, when they reach the printing room, the book publishing executive shows up {{with a group of}} armed men. He reveals that someone tipped him off about their plan, just as Lisa appears letting them know it was her because <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>her</b> name on a book that will actually be popular. The executive types in the password in the printing machine and gives Lisa the honor of inserting the USB flash drive with the novel on it. Later, when the saddened members of the group-writing team are walking away from the headquarters, they pass a book store and discover that The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy is being put on the stands. Lisa shows up again, letting them know that she only pretended to betray them so that the publisher would type in the password. When Lisa gave Bart a hug, she replaced the executive's flash drive with Bart's flash drive that contained the troll novel. As a result, she was able to put the original version into print. Lisa is happy to know that her name is finally on a book; however, when she opens a copy, she discovers that Gaiman is listed as the author, not her. It turns out that there were three flash drives and that Gaiman heisted his way to the best-seller list [...] "once again" [...] despite being illiterate. During the credits, it is revealed that Moe was aware of Gaiman's scheme, and was in fact allied with him from the start. The two celebrate with a toast at Shelbyville Beach, but Gaiman double-crosses Moe and poisons his drink.|$|E

500|$|Mays has deemed Emma an [...] "amazing" [...] {{character}} to play, and has explained: [...] "I don't find that female characters are always written {{with a lot}} of depth, but she's so well defined on the page. Sure, she's terrified of germs and in love with a married man, so seeing her as the voice of reason for the kids is amazing." [...] Emma's relationship with Will will continue to grow, as [...] "she has these moments of clarity when she's talking to Will because he calms her." [...] Mays described her in an interview with TheTVChick: [...] "She is a romantic at heart. But she’s practical. She’s very interesting, because she does have those dreams and hopes of finding the right man. And in her mind, even though Will Schuester’s married, that sort of guy is like the perfect guy for her. She’s very practical in the fact that she doesn’t want to be alone and she knows that she’s somewhat limited in a small town to men. And Ken Tanaka is a very nice man, he’s not exactly like Will, but he’s good to her and he’s solid. He’s got a job, and he understands her and he understands all her quirks and stuff. So she’s practical, she knows that just might be her lot in life. So it’s weird. She’s got this very dreamy side about her and who she wants to be and what <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>her</b> life to be like. But she’s also got this very practical, down-to-earth, well this is kind of the best I can do thing. It’s funny {{a lot of people have}} thought that part about her is weak. Like a weak character flaw, but I actually don’t think that’s true. I really just think that’s the practical side of her. I think that’s her being practical. And I think a lot of people are like that sometimes." ...|$|E

Bradstreet uses various metaphors to {{describe}} her husband. The most visible use of metaphor that Bradstreet uses is comparing her husband to the seasons. When summer is gone, winter soon arrives. Summer {{can be seen as}} a time of happiness and warmth. Winter on the other hand can be seen as being gloomy and cold. Bradstreet's husband is her Sun and when he is with her it is always summer. She is happy and warm from the love that her husband brings when he is around. When her husband leaves home for work, everything then becomes winter. It is a sad, cold time for Bradstreet and she wishes for her husband to soon return. [...] "Return, return, sweet Sol, from Capricorn."

He can't be there always and he must go away at times. [...] "Till nature's sad decree shall call thee hence." [...] One thing that keeps her going is that even though they are far away from each other, they are one with each other.|$|E
