40|$|We {{describe}} {{the construction of}} a prototype hybrid permanent magnet dipole and quadruple. The magnet consists of two concentric rings of SmCo magnetic material 5 cm in length. The outer ring is made of 16 uniformly magnetized blocks assembled as a Halbach dipole and the inner ring has 32 blocks oriented in a similar fashion so as to generate a quadruple field. The resultant superimposed field is an offset quadruple field which allows us to center the field on the high-energy beam in the interaction region of the PEPII B factory. The dipole blocks are glued to the inside surface of an outer <b>support</b> <b>collar</b> and the quadruple blocks are held in a fixture that allows radial adjustment of the blocks prior to potting the entire assembly with epoxy. An extensive computer model of the magnet has been made and from this model we developed a tuning algorithm that allowed us to greatly reduce the n= 3 - 17 harmonics of the magnet.

40|$|Grafting {{in species}} other than Arabidopsis has {{generated}} persuasive evidence for long-distance signals involved in many plant processes, including regulation of flowering time and shoot branching. Hitherto, such approaches in Arabidopsis have been {{hampered by the}} lack of suitable grafting techniques. Here, a range of micrografting methods for young Arabidopsis seedlings are described. The simplest configuration was a single-hypocotyl graft, constructed with or without a <b>supporting</b> <b>collar,</b> allowing tests of root–shoot communication. More complex two-shoot grafts were also constructed, enabling tests of shoot–shoot communication. Integrity of grafts and absence of adventitious roots on scions were assessed using plants constitutively expressing a GUS gene as one graft partner. Using the max 1 (more axillary growth) and max 3 increased branching mutants, it was shown that a wild-type (WT) rootstock was able to inhibit rosette branching of mutant shoots. In two-shoot grafts with max 1 and WT shoots on a max 1 rootstock, the mutant shoot branched profusely, but the WT one did not. In two-shoot grafts with max 1 and WT shoots on a WT rootstock, neither shoot exhibited increased branching. The results mirror those previously demonstrated in equivalent grafting experiments with the ramosus mutants in pea, and are consistent with the concept that a branching signal is capable of moving from root to shoot, but not from shoot to shoot. These grafting procedures will be valuable for revealing genes associated with many other long-distance signalling pathways, including flowering, systemic resistance and abiotic stress responses. ...|$|R

Kelley et al.(1993) reported that 4.6  years following THA, 47 % of patients had good collar-calcar contact, none of which needed revision. On one hand, an undersized collar may be insufficient to prevent stem subsidence or rotation (Fig. 1 a and b). Several stems have relatively small collars that do not reach the medial margin of the femoral calcar and thus bear only on the cancellous bone. In a series of 103 hips implanted with collared stems, Meding et al. (1997) reported insufficient coverage of the femoral calcar by the prosthetic collar in 61 % of their patients. On the other hand, an oversized collar could, however, lead to painful ilipsoas impingement against the prosthetic overhang (Fig. 1 c). In a case report, Brew et al. (2011) confirmed that, because of a large protruding collar, their patient had iliopsoas tendonitis and required revision surgery. In another case report, Linder et al.

Subsequently, two major factions and two key agendas within the AfD will be discussed, providing clues toward understanding such discrepancies. The radical market-oriented nature of the party can be attributed to Eurosceptic economic liberals who founded and led the party during its nascent stage.
