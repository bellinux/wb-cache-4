This first paper discusses cable types and <b>shield</b> <b>connections.</b> In the second paper, the effects of load and source resistances and chassis connections are examined. For each topic, well established theories are compared to data from a real-world physical system. Finally, recommendations for minimizing cable susceptibility (and thus cable emissions) are presented. There are numerous papers and textbooks that present theoretical analyses of cable noise reduction techniques. However, empirical data is often targeted to low frequencies (e. g. 100 MHz). Additionally, a comprehensive study showing the relative effects of various noise reduction techniques is needed. These include the use of dedicated return wires, twisted wiring, cable <b>shielding,</b> <b>shield</b> <b>connections,</b> changing load or source impedances, and implementing load- or source-to-chassis isolation. We have created an experimental setup that emulates a real-world electrical system, while still allowing us to independently vary a host of parameters. The goal of the experiment was to determine the relative effectiveness of various noise reduction techniques when the cable is in the presence of radiated emissions from 2 MHz to 200 MHz. The electronic system (Fig. 1) consisted of two Hammond shielded electrical enclosures, one containing the source resistance, and the other containing the load resistance. The boxes were mounted on a large aluminium plate acting as the chassis. Cables connecting the two boxes measured 81 cm in length and were attached to the boxes using standard D 38999 military-style connectors. The test setup is shown in Fig. 2. Electromagnetic fields were created using an HP 8657 B signal generator, MiniCircuits ZHL- 42 W-SMA amplifier, and an EMCO 5103 TEM cell. Measurements were taken using an Agilent E 4401 B spectrum analyzer and HP 1141 a differential probes...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the analysis and}} design of an integrated interface for grounded capacitive sensors. To reduce the effects of parasitic cable capacitances, a feedforward technique has been applied. In combination {{with the use of}} a special front-end amplifier this yields high immunity for a parasitic cable capacitance. The major nonidealities of the interface circuit have been analyzed. The complete interface has been designed and implemented as an integrated circuit, using standard 0. 7 ?m CMOS technology. Experimental results, which are in good agreement with theoretical analysis and simulation, show that for sensor capacitance down to 10 pF, <b>shielded</b> <b>connection</b> cables up to 30 m can be handled with an absolute error of less than 0. 3 pF.

40|$|In-core {{temperature}} measurement {{is a critical}} issue for the safe operation of nuclear reactors. Classical thermocouples require <b>shielded</b> <b>connections</b> and are known to drift under high neutron fluence. As an alternative, we propose {{to take advantage of}} the multiplexing capabilities of fiber Bragg grating (FBG) temperature sensors. Our experiments show that sensitivity to radiation depends on both the radiation field and the grating characteristics. For some FBGs installed in an air-cooled graphite-moderated nuclear reactor the difference between the measurements and the readings of calibrated backup thermocouples was within the measurement uncertainty. In the worst case, the difference saturated after 30 h of reactor operation at about 5 °C. To reach megagray per hour level gamma-dose rates and 1019 neutron/cm 2 fluences, we irradiated multiplexed FBG sensors in a material testing nuclear reactor. At room temperature, FBG temperature sensors can survive in such radiation conditions, but at 90 °C a severe degradation is observed. We evidence the possibility to use FBG sensing technology for in-core monitoring of nuclear reactors with specific care under well-specified conditions.

50|$|Cable {{shielding}} may {{be required}} in order to improve a Cat 6 cable's performance in high electromagnetic interference (EMI) environments. This shielding reduces the corrupting effect of EMI on the cable's data. Shielding is typically maintained from one cable end to the other using a drain wire that runs through the cable alongside the twisted pairs. The <b>shield's</b> electrical <b>connection</b> to the chassis on each end is made through the jacks. The requirement for ground connections at both cable ends creates the possibility that a ground loop may result if one of the networked chassis is at different instantaneous electrical potential with respect to its mate. This undesirable situation may compel currents to flow between chassis through the network cable shield, and these currents may in turn induce detrimental noise in the signal being carried by the cable.|$|R
5000|$|The primary {{disadvantage}} of analog signals {{is that any}} system has noise - i.e., unwanted variation. As the signal is copied and re-copied, or transmitted over long distances, or electronically processed, the unavoidable noise introduced by each step in the signal path is additive, progressively degrading the signal-to-noise ratio, until in extreme cases the signal can be overwhelmed. This is called generation loss. Noise can show up as [...] "hiss" [...] and intermodulation distortion in audio signals, or [...] "snow" [...] in video signals. This degradation is impossible to recover, {{since there is no}} sure way to distinguish the noise from the signal; amplifying the signal to recover attenuated parts of the signal amplifies the noise (distortion/interference) as well. Digital signals can often be transmitted, stored and processed without introducing noise. Electrically, analog noise can be diminished by <b>shielding,</b> good <b>connections</b> and several cable types such as coaxial or twisted pair.|$|R

40|$|The analys is of Monte Carlo methods {{here has}} been made in {{connection}} with a particular problem concerning the transport of low energy photons (30 - 140 keV) through layers of water with thicknesses between 5 and 20 cm. While not claiming to be a complete exposition of available Monte Carlo techniques, the methodological analyses are not restricted to this particular problem. The report describes in a general manner a number of methods which can be used in order to obtain results of greater precision in a fixed computing time. Monte Carlo methods have been used for many years in reactor technology, particularly for solving problems associated with neutron transport, but also for studying photon transport through radiation <b>shields.</b> In <b>connection</b> with these particular problems, mathematically and statistically advanced methods have been worked out. The book by Spanier and Gelbard (1969) is a good illustration of this. In the present case, a more physical approach to Monte Carlo methods for solving photon transport problems is made (along the lines employed by Fano, Spencer and Berger (1959)) with the aim of encouraging even radiation physicists to use more sophisticated Monte Carlo methods. Today, radiation physicists perform Monte Carlo calculations with considerable physical significance but often with unnecessarily straightforward methods. As Monte Carlo calculations can be predicted to be of increasing importance in tackling problems in radiation physics, e. g., in X-ray diagnostics, it is worthwhile to study the Monte Carlo approach for its own sake...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} work presented here, is to contribute to the adaptation of electronic packaging towards the needs of high frequency applications. As the field of electronic packaging stretches over several very different professional areas, it takes an interdisciplinary approach to optimize the technology of electronic packaging. Besides this, an extensive knowledge of industrial engineering should be an essential part of this undertaking to improve electronic packaging. Customary advances in technology are driven by new findings and a continuous development of processes in clearly defined fields. However, in the field of the higher levels of the interconnection hierarchy, that is external to the chip level interconnections and chip packaging, it is supposed that a wide combination of disciplines and technical creativity, instead of advanced technology in a special area should produce most added value. The thesis is divided into five areas, interlinked by the overall aim of there advantages to the common goal. These areas are the Printed Wiring Board (PWB) technology, PWB connections using flexible printed circuit boards, multiconductor cable <b>connections,</b> <b>shielded</b> enclosures and the related EMC issues, and finally the cooling of electronics. A central issue was to improve the shielded enclosures to be effective also at very high frequencies; it will be shown that shielded enclosures without apertures can cope with frequencies up to and above 15 GHz. Due to this enclosure without apertures, it was necessary to develop a novel cooling structure. This cooling structure consists of a heat sink where the PCB’s are inserted in close contact to the cooling fins on one side, whereas {{the other side of the}} heat sink is cooled by forced ventilation. The heat transfer between these parts is completely inside the same body. Tests carried out on a prototype have shown that the performance of the cooling structure is satisfactory for electronic cooling. Another problem area that is addressed are the interconnect problems in high frequency applications. Interconnections between parts of a local electronic system, or as within the telecom and datacom field between subscribers, are commonly accomplished by cable connections. In this research work multiconductor cables are examined and a patented novel cable-connector for high frequency use is presented. Further, an experimental complex soldering method between flexible printed circuits boards and rigid printed circuits boards, as part of connections between PCBs, is shown. Finally, different sectors of the PCB technology for high frequency applications are scrutinized and measurements on microstrip structures are presented. QC 2010100...|$|R
