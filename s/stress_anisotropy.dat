40|$|Abstract. Theoretical {{studies have}} shown that the {{generation}} of the hydraulic fractures reduces or even reverses the <b>stress</b> <b>anisotropy</b> near the fractures and results in increasing the complexity of fractures. A finite element model was established in which the pore pressure elements were used to simulate the behavior of porous media and the pore pressure cohesive elements were adopted to catch the characters of hydraulic fractures. A special fracturing manner was adopted to create complicated fracture networks by reducing or even reversing the <b>stress</b> <b>anisotropy</b> between fractures. The geometries of hydraulic fractures, strains, stresses, pore pressure distributions and fluid pressures within the fractures are obtained. The results of the model are fit well with the corresponding theoretical data. The simulation results show that the <b>stress</b> <b>anisotropy</b> is reduced by the generation of the hydraulic fractures, multiple parallel transverse fractures of horizontal well even reverse the <b>stress</b> <b>anisotropy</b> in some place of the reservoir. The simulation results validate the feasibility of the theoretical studies and the expected complex network fractures could be created by adopting special fracturing manner...|$|E

40|$|Modulation of <b>stress</b> <b>anisotropy</b> of {{magnetostrictive}} nanomagnets with strain {{offers an}} extremely energy-efficient method of magnetization reversal. The reversal process, however, is often incoherent and hence error-prone {{in the presence}} of thermal noise at room temperature. Occurrence of incoherent metastable states in the potential landscape of the nanomagnet can further exacerbate the error. Stochastic micromagnetic simulations at room temperature are used to understand and calculate energy dissipations and switching error probabilities in this important magnetization switching methodology. We find that these quantities have an intriguing dependence on nanomagnet size: small nanomagnets perform better owing {{to the fact that they}} are more resilient to the formation of metastable states and magnetization dynamics in them is more coherent. However, for a fixed <b>stress</b> <b>anisotropy</b> energy density, smaller nanomagnets will also have poorer resilience against thermal instability.

30|$|Extraction and {{injection}} of fluids within hydrocarbon reservoirs alters the in situ pore pressure leading {{to changes in}} the effective stress field within the reservoir and surrounding rocks. However, changes in pore pressure do not necessarily lead to a hydrostatic change in effective stress. For instance, a reduction in fluid pressure within a reservoir is often accompanied by a slower increase in the minimum effective horizontal stress with respect to the vertical effective stress change (e.g., Segura et al. 2011). This asymmetry can result in the development of <b>stress</b> <b>anisotropy</b> that may promote elastic failure within the rock, such as fault reactivation and borehole deformation. From the perspective of seismic monitoring, changes in the stress field can lead to microseismicity as well as nonlinear changes in seismic velocity and, in cases where <b>stress</b> <b>anisotropy</b> develop, to stress-induced seismic anisotropy. This has important implications on the interpretation of time-lapse (4 D) seismic as well as microseismic data, where <b>stress</b> <b>anisotropy</b> can result in anisotropic perturbations in the velocity field, offset and azimuthal variations in reflection amplitudes and shear-wave splitting.|$|E

The magnetic behavior of different core-shell samples shows no hysteresis loop indicating the superparamagnetic behavior of Fe@Au systems. The superparamagnetic behavior is also evidenced from FC and ZFC dependences of the magnetization versus temperature.

40|$|The {{equilibrium}} {{states of}} homogeneous turbulent buoyant flows are investigated through a fixed-point {{analysis of the}} evolution equations for the Reynolds <b>stress</b> <b>anisotropy</b> tensor and the scaled heat flux vector. The mean velocity and thermal fields {{are assumed to be}} two-dimensional. Scalar invariants formed from the Reynolds <b>stress</b> <b>anisotropy</b> tensor, the scaled heat flux vector, and the strain rate and rotation rate tensors are governed by a closed set of algebraic equations derived for the <b>stress</b> <b>anisotropy</b> and scaled heat flux under a (weak) equilibrium assumption. Six equilibrium state variables are identified for the buoyant case and contrasted with the corresponding two state variables obtained for the non-buoyant homogeneous turbulence case. These results, while dependent on the functional forms of the models for the pressure-strain rate correlation tensor and the pressure-scalar-gradient correlation and viscous dissipation vector, can be used as in the non-buoyant case to either calibrate new closure models or validate the performance of existing models. In addition, since the analysis only involves the turbulent time scales (both velocity and thermal) and their ratio, the results of the analysis are independent of the specific models for the dissipation rates of the turbulent kinetic energy and the temperature variance. The analytical results are compared with model predictions as well as recent direct numerical simulation (DNS) data for buoyant shear flows. Good agreement with DNS data is obtained.

The results have demonstrated that the compressive stress can lead to a significant change in the initial polarization state in the crystal. The reason lies in the <b>stress</b> induced <b>anisotropy</b> which is the coupling between the compressive stress and the electrostrictive coefficients. Thus, the initial polarization state in single crystal is determined by the combination of both electrocrystalline <b>anisotropy</b> and the <b>stress</b> induced <b>anisotropy.</b> The compressive <b>stress</b> along the [100] axis can make the polarization in the crystal be perpendicular to the stress direction, and make it difficult to be polarized to the saturation.

30|$|We {{investigate}} a detailed spatial variation in shear wave splitting {{in the zone}} of inland high strain rate, called the Niigata-Kobe Tectonic Zone (NKTZ), central Japan. Most observations show <b>stress</b> induced <b>anisotropy,</b> that is, {{the orientation of the}} faster polarized shear wave is parallel to the axis of the maximum horizontal compressional strain rate estimated from GPS data. Others show structure induced anisotropy, that is, the orientation is parallel to the strike of active faults. For the <b>stress</b> induced <b>anisotropy,</b> time delays normalized by the path length in the anisotropic upper crust is proportional to the differential strain rate. We estimate a spatial variation in stressing rate of the upper crust beneath the high strain rate zone based on a response of the normalized time delay to a step-wise stress change caused by a moderate-sized earthquake. The variation in the stressing rate of 3 kPa/year estimated from shear wave splitting is coincident with that from GPS data. We conclude, together with other seismological features in the NKTZ reported previously, that the high strain rate in the NKTZ is attributed to the high deformation rate below the brittle-ductile transition zone in the crust.|$|R
