5|$|Adults outnumber juveniles in most populations, but gauging the ratios is {{difficult}} because juveniles are harder to catch; with current <b>sampling</b> <b>methods,</b> estimates of age distribution vary widely. Annual survival rate of painted turtles increases with age. The probability of a painted turtle surviving from the egg to its first birthday is only 19%. For females, the annual survival rate rises to 45% for juveniles and 95% for adults. The male survival rates follow a similar pattern, but are lower overall than females, creating an average male age {{lower than that of}} the female. Natural disasters can confound age distributions. For instance, a hurricane can destroy many nests in a region, resulting in fewer hatchlings the next year. Age distributions may also be skewed by migrations of adults.|$|E
5|$|Given the inaccessibility {{of much of}} the species' range, {{particularly}} the central Amazon, estimating jaguar numbers is difficult. Researchers typically focus on particular bioregions, thus species-wide analysis is scant. In 1991, 600–1,000 (the highest total) were estimated to be living in Belize. A year earlier, 125–180 jaguars were estimated to be living in Mexico's 4,000-km2 (2400-mi2) Calakmul Biosphere Reserve, with another 350 in the state of Chiapas. The adjoining Maya Biosphere Reserve in Guatemala, with an area measuring 15,000km2 (9,000mi2), may have 465–550 animals. Work employing GPS telemetry in 2003 and 2004 found densities of only six to seven jaguars per 100km2 in the critical Pantanal region, compared with 10 to 11 using traditional methods; this suggests the widely used <b>sampling</b> <b>methods</b> may inflate the actual numbers of cats.|$|E

Its production was notably more lush and elaborate than West's 2004 debut album The College Dropout, as he utilized intricate <b>sampling</b> <b>methods</b> and string orchestration with Brion. West's lyrics explore both personal and political themes, including poverty, drug trafficking, racism, healthcare, and the blood diamond trade.|$|E

For {{an inverse}} {{potential}} scattering problem of stationary Schrödinger equation, we employ a direct <b>sampling</b> <b>method</b> {{to reconstruct the}} support of the potential.

We study the effectiveness of approximation strategy from the aspects of approximation <b>method,</b> <b>sampling</b> data selection <b>method</b> and <b>sampling</b> size. We discuss and analyze the optimization performance of each method. For the approximation method, we use least square approximation, spline interpolation, Newton interpolation, and support vector regression to approximate fitness landscape of fireworks algorithm in projected lower dimensional, original and higher dimensional search space. With regard to the <b>sampling</b> data selection <b>method,</b> we define three approaches, i. e., best <b>sampling</b> <b>method,</b> distance near the best fitness individual <b>sampling</b> <b>method,</b> and random <b>sampling</b> <b>method</b> to investigate each <b>sampling</b> <b>method’s</b> performance.

40|$|We {{examine the}} learning-curve <b>sampling</b> <b>method,</b> an {{approach}} for applying machinelearning algorithms to large data sets. The approach {{is based on}} the observation that the computational cost of learning a model increases {{as a function of the}} sample size of the training data, whereas the accuracy of a model has diminishing improvements as a function of sample size. Thus, the learning-curve <b>sampling</b> <b>method</b> monitors the increasing costs and performance as larger and larger amounts of data are used for training, and terminates learning when future costs outweigh future benefits.

In addition, we describe the application of the learning-curve <b>sampling</b> <b>method</b> to the task of model-based clustering via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.

Only matrix multiplication {{is involved in}} the computation, thus the novel <b>sampling</b> <b>method</b> is very easy and simple to implement. With the help of the factorization of the far field operator, we establish an inf-criterion for characterization of underlying scatterers. This result is then used to give a lower bound of the proposed indicator functional for sampling points inside the scatterers. While for the sampling points outside the scatterers, we show that the indicator functional decays like the bessel functions as the sampling point goes away from the boundary of the scatterers. We also show that the proposed indicator functional continuously dependents on the scattering amplitude, this further implies that the novel <b>sampling</b> <b>method</b> is extremely stable with respect to errors in the data. Different to the classical <b>sampling</b> <b>method</b> such as the linear <b>sampling</b> <b>method</b> or the factorization method, from the numerical point of view, the novel indicator takes its maximum near the boundary of the underlying target and decays like the bessel functions as the sampling points go away from the boundary.
