As the veligers mature, they develop their first shell (the smooth protoconch) and turn into very small juvenile snails, at which point they sink to the ocean floor. As {{is the case in}} all shelled mollusks, the mantle is what secretes the shell; shell growth begins at what will later become the apex of the shell, and typically rotates clockwise. As the animal gradually matures, the mantle continues to secrete <b>shell</b> <b>material.</b> Scotch bonnets complete maturation in one to six years. However, some have lived more than six years.|$|E
25|$|Oxygen is also cycled {{between the}} {{biosphere}} and lithosphere. Marine organisms in the biosphere create calcium carbonate <b>shell</b> <b>material</b> (CaCO3) that {{is rich in}} oxygen. When the organism dies, its shell is deposited on the shallow sea floor and buried over time to create the limestone sedimentary rock of the lithosphere. Weathering processes initiated by organisms can also free oxygen from the lithosphere. Plants and animals extract nutrient minerals from rocks and release oxygen in the process.|$|E

500|$|Though {{this view}} is still widely accepted, in the 1980s a group of Dutch paleontologists used Dubois's {{collection}} of more than 20,000 animal fossils to reassess the date of the layer in which Java Man was found.

This assessment dates the fossils of Java Man to between 900,000 and 1,000,000 years old.

30|$|In this work, {{we carried}} out the growth and {{characterization}} of InGaAs/InP core–shell nanowires on Si–(111) substrates using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). It is found that the strain at the core–shell interface resulting from large lattice mismatch between the core and <b>shell</b> <b>materials</b> has strong influence on the growth behavior of the InP shell. The large lattice mismatch between the core and <b>shell</b> <b>materials</b> can lead to non-uniform nucleation of InP coating layer around the InGaAs core nanowires and even to the bending of the nanowires. By optimizing growth conditions, the InGaAs/InP core−shell nanowires with good morphology can be achieved. Moreover, photoluminescence (PL) measurements at 77  K show that PL peak intensity from the InGaAs/InP core−shell nanowires shows an about 100 times enhancement compared to the bare InGaAs nanowires due to the passivation of surface states and effective carrier confinement via InP coating layer.|$|R
