25|$|The news of {{the victory}} was {{received}} in Britain with the warmest enthusiasm. It was the first certain sign that the mutinies of the summer had not destroyed {{the power and the}} prestige of the Royal Navy. Duncan was at once (21 October) raised to the peerage as Viscount Duncan, of Camperdown, and Baron Duncan, of Lundie in the Shire of Perth (with which came the lands now known as Camperdown Park in Dundee), and there was a strong feeling that the reward was inadequate. Even as early as 18 October his aunt, Lady Mary Duncan, wrote to Henry Dundas, at that time secretary of state for war: Report <b>says</b> <b>my</b> nephew is only made a Viscount. Myself it is nothing, but the whole nation thinks the least you can do is to give him an English earldom. … Am sure were this properly represented to our good king, who esteems a brave, religious man like himself, would be of my opinion. …. It was not, however, till 1831, many years after Duncan's death, that his son, then bearing his title, was raised to the dignity of an earl, and his other children to the rank and precedence of the children of an earl.|$|E

But the one who was cleverer than the rest chose the king as his patron, as all the other officials were liable to be changed, but the king would remain the king.

2500|$|Darwin {{had already}} made his views clearer to others, telling Lyell that if each step in {{evolution}} was providentially planned, the whole procedure would be a miracle and natural selection superfluous.

[...] Darwin subsequently corresponded with Herschel, and in January 1861 Herschel added a footnote to the draft of his Physical Geography [...] which, while disparaging [...] "the principle of arbitrary and casual variation and natural selection" [...] as insufficient without [...] "intelligent direction", said that [...] "with some demur as to the genesis of man, we are far from disposed to repudiate the view taken of this mysterious subject in Mr. Darwin's book." ...|$|E

A widower he wos, and fat enough for anything--uncommon fat, to be sure. His missus dies, and leaves him four hundred pound.

[...] <b>says</b> <b>my</b> father.--"Licence, Sir," [...] says he.--"What licence?" [...] <b>says</b> <b>my</b> father.--"Marriage licence," [...] says the touter.--"Dash my veskit," [...] <b>says</b> <b>my</b> father, [...] "I never thought o' that."--"I think you wants one, Sir," [...] says the touter.

[...] "Pray take a seat, vile I makes out the affidavit, Sir," [...] says the lawyer.--"Thank'ee, Sir," [...] <b>says</b> <b>my</b> father, and down he sat, and stared with all his eyes, and his mouth vide open, at the names on the boxes.

[...] "Belle Savage," [...] <b>says</b> <b>my</b> father; for he stopped there wen he drove up, and he know'd nothing about parishes, he didn't.--"And what's the lady's name?" [...] says the lawyer.

[...] says the lawyer.--"No more nor you do," [...] <b>says</b> <b>my</b> father; [...] "can't I put that in arterwards?"--"Impossible!"

[...] The licence was made out, and she DID have him, and what's more she's got him now; and I never had any of the four hundred pound, worse luck. Beg your pardon, sir,' said Sam, when he had concluded, 'but wen I gets on this here grievance, I runs on like a new barrow with the wheel greased.'
