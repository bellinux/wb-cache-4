25|$|Glass: Borosilicate {{glass is}} safe at oven temperatures. The clear glass {{also allows for}} the food to be seen during the cooking process. However, it cannot be used on a <b>stovetop,</b> as it cannot cope with <b>stovetop</b> temperatures.|$|E
25|$|Non-metallic {{cookware}} {{can be used}} in both {{conventional and}} microwave ovens. Non-metallic cookware typically can not be used on the <b>stovetop,</b> although Corningware and Pyroflam are some exceptions.|$|E
25|$|Casserole pans (for making casseroles) {{resemble}} roasters and Dutch ovens, {{and many}} recipes {{can be used}} interchangeably between them. Depending on their material, casseroles {{can be used in}} the oven or on the <b>stovetop.</b> Casseroles are commonly made of glazed ceramics or Pyrex.|$|E

50|$|Modern kitchen stoves may use {{alternative}} methods for heating food. Natural gas and electric stoves {{are the most}} common today in western countries. Both are equally effective and safe, and the choice between the two is largely a matter of personal preference and pre-existing utility outlets: if a house has no gas supply, adding one {{just to be able to}} run a gas stove is an expensive endeavor. In particular, professional chefs often prefer gas <b>stovetops,</b> for they allow them to control the heat more finely and more quickly. On the other hand, some chefs often prefer electric stoves because they tend to heat food more evenly. Today's major brands offer both gas and electric stoves, and many also offer dual-fuel stoves combining gas and electric <b>stovetops.</b>|$|R
25|$|Dutch ovens are heavy, {{relatively}} deep pots {{with a heavy}} lid, {{designed to}} re-create oven conditions on the <b>stovetop</b> or campfire. They {{can be used for}} stews, braised meats, soups and a large variety of other dishes that benefit from low heat, slow cooking. Dutch ovens are typically made from cast iron or Natural Clay and are sized by volume.|$|E
25|$|Popping of the kernels was {{achieved}} by hand on the <b>stovetop</b> through the 19th century. Kernels were sold on the East Coast of the United States under names such as Pearls or Nonpareil. The term popped corn first appeared in John Russell Bartlett’s 1848 Dictionary of Americanisms. Popcorn is an ingredient in Cracker Jack, {{and in the early}} years of the product, it was popped by hand.|$|E
25|$|While kosher for Passover {{packaged}} goods {{are available in}} stores, some families opt to cook everything from scratch during Passover week. In Israel, families that do not kasher their ovens can bake cakes, casseroles, and even meat on the <b>stovetop</b> in a Wonder Pot, an Israeli invention consisting of three parts: an aluminium pot shaped like a Bundt pan, a hooded cover perforated with venting holes, and a thick, round, metal disc with a center hole which is placed between the Wonder Pot and the flame to disperse heat.|$|E
50|$|This is a day-use hut, with no {{sleeping}} facilities. It {{is equipped}} with propane powered lamps and <b>stovetops,</b> and a wood burning fireplace for heating and drying clothes. There are numerous tent sites on the property for use by Alpine Club members and guests during summer weekends.|$|R
50|$|Camping stoves are {{designed}} for use by people travelling by car, boat, canoe, or on horseback. They are similar in function {{and ease of use}} to kitchen <b>stovetops,</b> usually with two burners set into a table-like surface, and often with a folding lid for stowage and wind protection. This increases the weight accordingly.|$|R
50|$|Glass-ceramics {{are used}} to make {{cookware}} (originally known by the brand name CorningWare) and <b>stovetops</b> which have both high resistance to thermal shock and extremely low permeability to liquids. The negative {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} of the crystalline ceramic phase can be balanced with the positive coefficient of the glassy phase. At a certain point (~70% crystalline) the glass-ceramic has a net coefficient of thermal expansion close to zero. This type of glass-ceramic exhibits excellent mechanical properties and can sustain repeated and quick temperature changes up to 1000 °C.|$|R
25|$|Spinach retains {{nearly all}} its folate when cooked in a microwave; in comparison, it loses about 77% when boiled, {{leaching}} out nutrients. Bacon cooked by microwave has significantly {{lower levels of}} carcinogenic nitrosamines than conventionally cooked bacon. Steamed vegetables tend to maintain more nutrients when microwaved than when cooked on a <b>stovetop.</b> Microwave blanching is 3–4 times more effective than boiled water blanching in the retaining of the water-soluble vitamins folic acid, thiamin and riboflavin, {{with the exception of}} ascorbic acid, of which 28.8% is lost (vs. 16% with boiled water blanching).|$|E
25|$|Ham {{and eggs}} {{is a popular}} dish often served as a breakfast meal in the United States. It is also {{consumed}} as a dinner or supper dish, for example {{in parts of the}} Southern United States, and is sometimes served as a lunch dish. Ham and eggs are the primary ingredients. Eggs served with the dish can be fried, scrambled or poached. Additional ingredients such as tomatoes and seasonings, such as Herbes de Provence, are sometimes used. The dish can be prepared on a <b>stovetop</b> in a skillet or frying pan, and also baked or broiled in an oven.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of pottery {{allowed for the}} creation of fireproof cooking vessels in a variety of shapes and sizes. Coating the earthenware with some type of plant gum, and later glazes, converted the porous container into a waterproof vessel. The earthenware cookware could then be suspended over a fire through use of a tripod or other apparatus, or even be placed directly into a low fire or coal bed {{as in the case of}} the pipkin. Ceramics conduct heat poorly, however, so ceramic pots must cook over relatively low heats and over long periods of time. However, most ceramic pots will crack if used on the <b>stovetop,</b> and are only intended for the oven.|$|E
40|$|Solar Cooking {{description}} and cooking guidelinesIn today’s society, {{most people do}} not routinely think of the cooking power of the sun. Oh, on a hot summer day one may joke about cooking an egg on the sidewalk. However, the reusable resource of the sun is often overlooked as a way to reduce energy loads on wood and electricity. Daily cooking with conventional heating such as ovens or <b>stovetops,</b> require long periods of heat, increasing the amount of fuel needed to cook. Solar cooking eliminates the cost of fuel to complete food preparation (or at least reduces the amount of fuel used for cooking). Solar cooking is reported to decrease fuel consumption by 38 %...|$|R
50|$|Smoke alarms {{installed}} in homes {{are used to}} reduce deaths resulting from fire by half. Homeowners should change batteries {{at least once a}} year and replace smoke alarms every decade. Before fire occurs, a family should practice evacuating home, and when fire occurs the family must leave the residence immediately (within two minutes). To prevent house fires, a family should keep flammable objects, like matches, out of children's reach, and they must not leave anything involving flames unattended while keeping objects that can catch fire away from it by at least 12 inches, like stove ovens, <b>stovetops,</b> space heaters, and candles. Fire extinguishers should be stored in the kitchen, where most house fires start.|$|R
25|$|Due to {{the absence}} of {{contemporary}} culinary utensils such as the refrigerator, gas <b>stovetops</b> and ovens, the Indigenous resorted to other means to prepare their food. Upon bringing back hunted game meat, the Aborigines would preserve the meat with either millet wine or salt. Another cooking technique involved the heating up of stones by fire, which are then placed inside a vessel with other certain meats and seafood, which are cooked from the heat of the stones. Foods were mostly prepared by steaming, boiling or roasting, in order to infuse flavours together, yet preserve the original flavours. This again is contrasted with the Han, who adopted skills like stir-frying and stewing. Meat was also put on a bamboo spit and cooked over the fire.|$|R
25|$|Carbon steel {{cookware}} can {{be rolled}} or hammered into relatively thin sheets of dense material, which provides robust strength and improved heat distribution. Carbon steel accommodates high, dry heat for such operations as dry searing. Carbon steel does not conduct heat efficiently, {{but this may}} be an advantage for larger vessels, such as woks and paella pans, where one portion of the pan is intentionally kept at a different temperature than the rest. Like cast iron, carbon steel must be seasoned before use, usually by rubbing a fat or oil on the cooking surface and heating the cookware on the <b>stovetop</b> or in the oven. With proper use and care, seasoning oils polymerize on carbon steel to form a low-tack surface, well-suited to browning, Maillard reactions and easy release of fried foods. Carbon steel will easily rust if not seasoned and should be stored seasoned to avoid rusting. Carbon steel is traditionally used for crêpe and fry pans, as well as woks.|$|E
500|$|Perry {{explains}} {{her feelings}} about bacon in the book's introduction, observing that its smell while cooking helps start her day and provide {{her with a}} sense of calmness. The beginning of the book provides background on the phrase [...] "", introduces the reader to types of bacon and describes storage methods. The book offers 70recipes for bacon-flavored dishes, in nine chapters organized by topic, including breakfast, leaf vegetables, pasta meals, side dishes, party servings, desserts and appetizers. Recipes include a bacon sandwich using other ingredients, a bacon crunch topping for ice cream, a bacon concoction to top a fruit crisp, and a pie crust that incorporates bacon. Methods are offered for cooking bacon on a <b>stovetop,</b> in an oven and under a griller to maximize its flavor and appearance. The book is illustrated with photographs by Sheri Giblin.|$|E

50|$|In Judaism, the {{permissibility}} of food {{is influenced}} by many secondary factors. For instance, vessels and implements used to cook food must also be kept separate from non-kosher products, and not used for both dairy products and meat products. (If a vessel or implement used to cook dairy products is then used to cook meat, the food becomes non-kosher and the vessel or implement itself {{can no longer be}} used for the preparation or consumption of a kosher meal.) In general, the same policy extends to any apparatus used in the preparation of foods, such as ovens or <b>stovetops.</b> Laws are somewhat more lenient for certain kitchen items such as microwaves or dishwashers, although this depends greatly on tradition (minhag) or individuals' own stringent practices (chumrot). As a result of these factors, many Conservative and Orthodox Jews refuse to eat dishes prepared at any restaurant that is not specifically kosher, even if the actual dish ordered uses only kosher ingredients.|$|R

It is now {{on display at the}} National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C. Beginning with In Julia's Kitchen with Master Chefs, the Childs' home kitchen in Cambridge was fully transformed into a functional set, with TV-quality lighting, three cameras positioned to catch all angles in the room, and a massive center island with a gas <b>stovetop</b> on one side and an electric <b>stovetop</b> on the other, but leaving the rest of the Childs' appliances alone, including [...] "my wall oven with its squeaking door."

2500|$|The {{shape of}} a chugun {{is similar to a}} {{traditional}} crock with a narrow top and bottom and wider in the middle. When used inside a traditional oven, a long handled holding tool is used with a roller that serves as a lever to lift a heavy chugun {{in and out of the}} oven. Since there are no handles, it's inconvenient to use a chugun on a <b>stovetop.</b>|$|E
2500|$|An {{electric}} stove {{is a large}} kitchen appliance {{that converts}} electricity into heat in order to cook and bake food. In addition to heated coils atop a <b>stovetop</b> range, glass-ceramic cooktops and induction stoves using electromagnetic induction {{have proven to be}} popular in commercial kitchens as well as for domestic use in homes. Canadian inventor Thomas Ahearn is often credited with inventing the electric cooking range in 1882. However, the first such patent for an electrical stove apparatus was awarded in the United States much earlier to George B. Simpson on September 20, 1859. Simpson's patent, US patent #25532 for an 'electro-heater' surface heated by an platinum-wire coil powered by batteries; is described in his own words to be useful to [...] "warm rooms, boil water, cook victuals...".|$|E
2500|$|Fumaric acid {{has been}} used as a food {{acidulant}} since 1946. It is approved for use as a food additive in the EU, USA and Australia and New Zealand. As a food additive, it is used as an acidity regulator and can be denoted by the E number E297. It is generally used in beverages and baking powders for which requirements are placed on purity. It is generally used as a substitute for tartaric acid and occasionally in place of citric acid, at a rate of 1g of fumaric acid to every ~1.5g of citric acid, in order to add sourness, similarly to the way malic acid is used. As well as being a component of some artificial vinegar flavors, such as [...] "Salt and Vinegar" [...] flavored potato chips, it is also used as a coagulant in <b>stovetop</b> pudding mixes.|$|E
