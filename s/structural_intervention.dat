Examples include prohibiting the commodification {{of the citizen}} needs, such as health care, ensuring equitable access to effective therapies, and developing social safety nets. These initiatives increase citizen's social and economic rights, thus decreasing structural violence. However, for these <b>structural</b> <b>interventions</b> to be successful, medical professionals need {{to be capable of}} executing such tasks. Unfortunately, many of these professionals are not trained to perform <b>structural</b> <b>interventions.</b> Moreover, medical professionals continue to operate under conventional clinical intervention because physicians can rightly note that <b>structural</b> <b>interventions</b> are not their job. Therefore, the onus falls more on political and other experts to implement such structural changes. As noted, structural forces account for most if not all epidemic diseases (e.g., HIV). Medical professionals still continue to operate under the downstream phenomenon, with a focus is on individual lifestyle factors rather than general socio-economic, cultural, and environmental conditions. This paradigm obscures the structural impediments to changes because it tends to avoid the root causes that should be focused on. One response is to incorporate medical professionals and to acknowledge that such active <b>structural</b> <b>interventions</b> are necessary to address real public health issues.|$|R

40|$|When {{seeking to}} prevent HIV/AIDS in women, {{attending}} to {{aspects of their}} lived experience provides opportunities to address the presence of social determinants in prevention strategies. According to the CDC, in 2010, the rate of new HIV infections among Black women was 20 times that of White women, while among Hispanic/Latino women it was 4 {{times the rate of}} White women. Additionally, 86 % of HIV infections in women were attributed to heterosexual contact and 14 % to injection drug use. The WHO indicates that worldwide, 49 % of individuals infected by HIV are women, with a predominant source of infection tied to heterosexual transmission. This paper presents social determinants as influential factors in terms of women’s sexual behavior decision-making, along with suggested <b>structural</b> <b>interventions</b> to address the social determinants of their HIV risks.

40|$|Despite massive {{investment}} in HIV control programs, HIV incidence rates {{in countries with}} generalized epidemics have not fallen {{for most of the}} last decade. It appears that those at risk are not adopting effective prevention strategies. Those who are unable to implement their prevention preferences are referred to as choice disabled. We examined how and to what extent <b>structural</b> <b>intervention</b> measures that support choice-disabled individuals can reduce HIV transmission and prevalence. A mathematical model was developed to describe HIV transmission among and between choice-disabled and choice-enabled individuals. Data were available from field trials identifying factors and effects of choice disability. The model was used to estimate the potential impact of an intervention strategy in which choice-disabled individuals are enabled to make prevention choices. Several scenarios were considered and compared: supporting only one or both genders; supporting only HIV- individuals or also HIV+ choice-disabled individuals. Substantial declines in HIV incidence and prevalence are observed when supportive interventions are included in the model. The magnitude of these declines depends on the scope of the intervention program. The largest positive effect occurs when the support program is offered regardless of HIV status. Addressing the effects of choice disability in any HIV intervention program could be crucial to the program's success. <b>Structural</b> <b>intervention</b> programs to support choice-disabled individuals in implementing prevention strategies greatly reduce HIV incidence and prevalence in mathematical models...|$|E

Methods We identified articles by systematically searching PubMed and Web of Science, reviewing references of selected studies, and contacting 23 experts.

Studies evaluated the quantitative impact of <b>structural</b> <b>interventions</b> {{for the prevention of}} male-to-female IPV in LMIC through (a) IPV incidence or prevalence or (b) secondary outcomes theoretically linked to IPV by study authors. After initial screening, we evaluated full text articles for inclusion and extracted data on study characteristics, outcomes, and risk of bias, using forms developed for the review. Results Twenty articles (16 studies) from nine countries met inclusion criteria, representing 13 randomized control trials and seven additional studies, all of which reported results from economic, social, or combined economic and social interventions. Standardized at p[*]<[*] 0. 05 or 95  % confidence intervals not including unity, 13 studies demonstrated statistically significant effects for at least one primary or secondary outcome, including decreased IPV and controlling behaviors; improved economic wellbeing; enhanced relationship quality, empowerment, or social capital; reduced acceptability of IPV; new help seeking behaviors; and more equitable gender norms.

50|$|The {{history of}} public health care clearly shows the global effort to improve health care for all. However, in modern-day medicine, real, {{measurable}} change has not been clearly seen, and critics argue that this lack of improvement is due to ineffective methods that are being implemented. As argued by Paul E. Farmer, <b>structural</b> <b>interventions</b> could possibly have a large impact, and yet there are numerous problems as to why this strategy {{has yet to be}} incorporated into the health system. One of the main reasons that he suggests could be the fact that physicians are not properly trained to carry out <b>structural</b> <b>interventions,</b> meaning that the ground level health care professionals cannot implement these improvements. While <b>structural</b> <b>interventions</b> can not be the only area for improvement, the lack of coordination between socioeconomic factors and health care for the poor could be counterproductive, and end up causing greater inequity between the health care services received by the rich and by the poor. Unless health care is no longer treated as a commodity, global public health can ultimately not be achieved.

40|$|Introduction: Female {{sex workers}} (FSWs) {{frequently}} experience violence {{in their work}} environments, violating their basic rights and increasing their vulnerability to HIV infection. <b>Structural</b> <b>interventions</b> addressing such violence are critical components of comprehensive HIV prevention programmes. We describe <b>structural</b> <b>interventions</b> developed to address violence against FSWs {{in the form of}} police arrest, {{in the context of the}} Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation's India AIDS Initiative (Avahan) in Karnataka, South India. We examine changes in FSW arrest between two consecutive time points during the intervention and identify characteristics that may increase FSW vulnerability to arrest in Karnataka. Methods: <b>Structural</b> <b>interventions</b> with police involved advocacy work with senior police officials, sensitization workshops, and integration of HIV and human rights topics in pre-service curricula. Programmes for FSWs aimed to enhance collectivization, empowerment and awareness about human rights and to introduce crisis response mechanisms. Three rounds of integrated behavioural and biological assessment surveys were conducted among FSWs from 2004 to 2011. We conducted bivariate and multivariate analyses using data from the second (R 2) and third (R 3) survey rounds to examine changes in arrests among FSWs over time and to assess associations between police arrest, and the sociodemographic and sex work-related characteristics of FSWs. Results: Among 4110 FSWs surveyed, rates of ever being arrested by the police significantly decreased over time, from 9. 9 % in R 2 to 6. 1 % in R 3 (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) [95 % CI]= 0. 63 [0. 48 to 0. 83]). Arrests in the preceding year significantly decreased, from 5. 5 % in R 2 to 2. 8 % in R 3 (AOR [95 % CI]= 0. 59 [0. 41 to 0. 86]). FSWs arrested as part of arbitrary police raids also decreased from 49. 6 to 19. 5 % (AOR [95 % CI]= 0. 21 [0. 11 to 0. 42]). Certain characteristics, including financial dependency on sex work, street- or brothel-based solicitation and high client volumes, were found to significantly increase the odds of arrest for participants. Conclusion: <b>Structural</b> <b>interventions</b> addressing police arrest of FSWs are feasible to implement. Based on our findings, the design of violence prevention and response interventions in Karnataka can be tailored to focus on FSWs, who are disproportionately vulnerable to arrest by police. Context-specific <b>structural</b> <b>interventions</b> can reduce police arrests, create a safer work environment for FSWs and protect fundamental human rights...|$|R
40|$|Electronic {{networks}} of practice can help an organizations discover and share knowledge more effectively by facilitating learning both {{from within the}} organization {{as well as from}} entities outside the organization. In those instances where firms have linkages with outside organizations, however, the acquisition and sharing of knowledge takes place free from the constraints of hierarchy and local rules. These networks can be characterized as loosely structured, and generally self-organizing, which are made up of individuals who voluntarily participate in the creation and sharing of knowledge. Building networks without formal boundaries is a challenging task for any organization.
