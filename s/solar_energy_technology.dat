25|$|Solar {{power in}} Israel and the Israeli solar energy {{industry}} {{has a history}} that dates to {{the founding of the}} country. In the 1950s, Levi Yissar developed a solar water heater to help assuage an energy shortage in the new country. By 1967 around one in twenty households heated their water with the sun and 50,000 solar heaters had been sold. With the 1970s oil crisis, Harry Zvi Tabor, the father of Israel's solar industry, developed the prototype solar water heater that is now used in over 90% of Israeli homes. Israeli engineers are {{on the cutting edge of}} <b>solar</b> <b>energy</b> <b>technology,</b> and its solar companies work on projects around the world.|$|E
