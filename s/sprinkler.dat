40|$|The U. S.

New <b>sprinklers</b> and <b>sprinklers</b> exposed to the mine environment were subjected to increasing pressures until leakage occurred. The average leak pressures of the new <b>sprinklers</b> ranged from 640 to 2, 300 psig and were significantly different for <b>sprinklers</b> from different manufacturers and for different types of <b>sprinklers.</b> Generally, standard-response <b>sprinklers</b> withstood higher pressures than fast-response <b>sprinklers.</b> The results indicated that most commercially available <b>sprinklers</b> would withstand the high static pressures in deep underground coal mines; however, they would not provide the same reliability and safety factor as <b>sprinklers</b> used aboveground at or below their rated pressure of 175 psig. The average leak pressures of the <b>sprinklers</b> exposed to the mine environment ranged from 740 to 1, 180 psig. The mine environment affected the ability of 66 % of the <b>sprinklers</b> to withstand high static pressures.

5|$|Dead trees pose {{a safety}} risk, {{especially}} during high winds and severe storms, and removing dead trees involves a financial burden, whereas {{the presence of}} healthy trees can clean the air, increase property values, and reduce {{the temperature of the}} built environment and thereby reduce building cooling costs.

Irrigating trees during dry periods can reduce the risk of water stress and death. Irrigation can be accomplished by use of a garden hose, soaker hose, <b>sprinkler,</b> or modified five-gallon bucket.|$|E

Including subsequent damage from Gonzalo, about $2 million was spent on airport repairs, and the storms were later cited as evidence of the need for a newer terminal in a more protected location.|$|E

Wade International Airport was flooded after the storm compromised its roof and <b>sprinkler</b> system. Along the coast, the storm unmoored and destroyed numerous boats. Immediately after the hurricane, 200Bermuda Regiment soldiers were called to clear debris and assist in initial damage repairs. Cleanup efforts overlapped with preparations for the approach of the stronger Hurricane Gonzalo, which struck the island less than six days later and compounded the damage.

Areas most affected by the fire were extinguished almost immediately, and the original fire was put out in a few hours. Most of the damage was on the 11th floor, where the fire was fueled by cabinets filled with paper, alcohol-based fluid for office machines, and other office equipment. Fireproofing protected the steel, and there was no structural damage to the tower.
