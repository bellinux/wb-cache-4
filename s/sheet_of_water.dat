At a trailer park in Homestead, water approached the doors of the mobile homes. A number of other homes in Homestead and Florida City were flooded. Many businesses in downtown Homestead closed after water began entering the buildings, with some store owners placing sandbags in front of their business. Dozens of cars were abandoned as roads began to flood. News reports noted that homes resembled islands, while roads were reduced to [...] "an impassable goo." [...] Flooding at Homestead Air Force Base forced officials to evacuate 86aircraft.|$|E

2500|$|In 1524, Giovanni da Verrazzano, an Italian {{explorer}} in {{the service}} of the French crown, explored the Atlantic coast of North America between the Carolinas and Newfoundland, including New York Harbor and Narragansett Bay. On April 17, 1524 Verrazzano entered New York Bay, by way of the Strait now called the Narrows. He described [...] "a vast coastline with a deep delta in which every kind of ship could pass" [...] and he adds: [...] "that it extends inland for a league and opens up to form a beautiful lake. This vast <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> swarmed with native boats". He landed on the tip of Manhattan and perhaps on the furthest point of Long Island.|$|E

2500|$|Jellyfish are {{not adapted}} to closed spaces. They depend on {{currents}} to transport them {{from place to}} place. Professional exhibits feature precise water flows, typically in circular tanks to avoid trapping specimens in corners. The Monterey Bay Aquarium uses {{a modified version of}} the kreisel (German for [...] "spinning top") for this purpose. The outflow is spread out over a large surface area and the inflow enters as a <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> in front of the outflow, so the jellyfish do not get sucked into it. As of 2009, jellyfish were becoming popular in home aquariums. These home aquariums generate this special water flow pattern using an air-lift pump and require special food for the jellyfish, which can be shipped from suppliers to their final destination.|$|E
2500|$|The book {{describes}} {{the construction of}} various automatic fountains, an aspect that was largely neglected in earlier Greek treatises on technology. In one of these fountains, the [...] "water issues from the fountainhead {{in the shape of}} a shield, or like a lily-of-the-valley," [...] i.e. [...] "the shapes are discharged alternatelyeither a <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> concave downwards, or a spray." [...] Another fountain [...] "discharges a shield or a single jet," [...] while a variation of this features double-action alternation, i.e. has two fountainheads, with one discharging a single jet and the other a shield, and the two alternating repeatedly. Another variation features one main fountainhead and two or more subsidiary ones, such that when the main one ejects a single jet, the subsidiaries eject shields, with the two alternating.|$|E
2500|$|The {{last of the}} North American proglacial lakes, {{north of}} the present Great Lakes, has been {{designated}} Glacial Lake Ojibway by geologists. It reached its largest volume around 8,500 years ago, when joined with Lake Agassiz. But its outlet was blocked by {{the great wall of}} the glaciers and it drained by tributaries, into the Ottawa and St. Lawrence Rivers far to the south. About 8,300 to 7,700 years ago, the melting ice dam over Hudson Bay's southernmost extension narrowed to the point where pressure and its buoyancy lifted it free, and the ice-dam failed catastrophically. Lake Ojibway's beach terraces show that it was [...] above sea level. The volume of Lake Ojibway is commonly estimated to have been about 163,000 cubic kilometres, more than enough water to cover a flattened-out Antarctica with a <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> [...] deep. That volume was added to the world's oceans in a matter of months.|$|E
50|$|Headward erosion is erosion at {{the origin}} of a stream channel, which causes the origin to move {{back away from the}} {{direction}} of the stream flow, and so causes the stream channel to lengthen. It can also refer to widening of a canyon by erosion along its very top edge, when <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> first enter the canyon from a more roughly planar surface above it, such as at Canyonlands National Park in Utah. (See image at right.) When <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> on a roughly planar surface first enter a depression in it, this erodes the top edge of the depression. This either causes the stream to grow longer at the very top of the stream, which moves its origin back, or causes the canyon formed by the stream to grow wider, by erosion along the length of its top side edge as <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> flow over the edge. Widening of the canyon by erosion inside the canyon, below the canyon side top edge, or origin or the stream, such as erosion caused by the streamflow inside it, is not called headwall erosion.|$|R

2500|$|.....my {{ears were}} saluted with the {{agreeable}} {{sound of a}} fall of water and advancing a little further I saw the spray arrise above the plain like a collumn of smoke which would frequently dispear again in an instant caused I presume by the wind which blew pretty hard from the S. W. I did not however loose my direction to this point which soon began to make a roaring too tremendious to be mistaken for any cause short of the great falls of the Missouri. ... I hurryed down the hill which was about 200 feet high and difficult of access, to gaze on this sublimely grand specticle. ... immediately at the cascade the river is about 300 yds. wide; about ninety or a hundred yards of this next the Lard. bluff is a smoth even <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> falling over a precipice of at least eighty feet, the remaining part of about 200 yards on my right formes the grandest sight I ever beheld, the hight of the fall is the same of the other but the irregular and somewhat projecting rocks below receives the water in it's passage down and brakes it into a perfect white foam which assumes a thousand forms in a moment sometimes flying up in jets of sparkling foam to the hight of fifteen or twenty feet and are scarcely formed before large roling bodies of the same beaten and foaming water is thrown over and conceals them. in short the rocks seem to be most happily fixed to present a sheet of the whitest beaten froath for 200 yards in length and about 80 feet perpendicular. the water after descending strikes against the butment before mentioned or that on which I stand and seems to reverberate and being met by the more impetuous courant they role and swell into half formed billows of great hight which rise and again disappear in an instant. this butment of rock defends a handsom little bottom of about three acres which is deversified and agreeably shaded with some cottonwood trees; in the lower extremity of the bottom {{there is a very}} thick grove of the same kind of trees which are small, in this wood there are several Indian lodges formed of sticks. ... from the reflection of the sun on the spray or mist which arrises from these falls there is a beatifull rainbow produced which adds not a little to the beauty of this majestically grand senery. after wrighting this imperfect discription I again viewed the falls and was so much disgusted with the imperfect idea which it conveyed of the scene that I determined to draw my pen across it and begin agin, but then reflected that I could not perhaps succeed better than pening the first impressions of the mind; I wished for the pencil of Salvator Rosa or the pen of Thompson, that I might be enabled to give to the enlightened world some just idea of this truly magnifficent and sublimely grand object, which has from the commencement of time been concealed from the view of civilized man; but this was fruitless and vain. I most sincerely regreted that I had not brought a crimee obscura with me by the assistance of which even I could have hoped to have done better but alas this was also out of my reach; I therefore with the assistance of my pen only indeavoured to traces some of the stronger features of this seen by the assistance of which and my recollection aided by some able pencil I hope still to give to the world some faint idea of an object which at this moment fills me with such pleasure and astonishment, and which of its kind I will venture to ascert is second to but one in the known world. ...|$|E
