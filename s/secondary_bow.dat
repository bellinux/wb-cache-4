50|$|Descartes' 1637 treatise, Discourse on Method, further {{advanced}} this explanation. Knowing {{that the size}} of raindrops did not appear to affect the observed rainbow, he experimented with passing rays of light through a large glass sphere filled with water. By measuring the angles that the rays emerged, he concluded that the primary bow was caused by a single internal reflection inside the raindrop and that a <b>secondary</b> <b>bow</b> could be caused by two internal reflections. He supported this conclusion with a derivation of the law of refraction (subsequently to, but independently of, Snell) and correctly calculated the angles for both bows. His explanation of the colours, however, was based on a mechanical version of the traditional theory that colours were produced by a modification of white light.|$|E
50|$|Up {{to eight}} {{separate}} bows may be distinguished if the reflected and reflection rainbows happen to occur simultaneously: The normal (non-reflection) primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>bows</b> {{above the horizon}} (1, 2) with their reflected counterparts below it (3, 4), and the reflection primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>bows</b> above the horizon (5, 6) with their reflected counterparts below it (7, 8).|$|R

50|$|For these reasons, {{naturally}} occurring rainbows of an order higher than 2 are rarely {{visible to the}} naked eye. Nevertheless, sightings of the third-order bow in nature have been reported, and in 2011 it was photographed definitively for the first time. Shortly after, the fourth-order rainbow was photographed as well, and in 2014 the first ever pictures of the fifth-order (or quinary) rainbow, located in between the primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>bows,</b> were published.|$|R
5000|$|Secondary rainbows {{are caused}} by a double {{reflection}} of sunlight inside the raindrops, and are centred on the sun itself. They are about 127° (violet) to 130° (red) wide. Since {{this is more than}} 90°, they are seen {{on the same side of}} the sky as the primary rainbow, about 10° above it at apparent angles of 50-53°. As a result of the [...] "inside" [...] of the <b>secondary</b> <b>bow</b> being [...] "up" [...] to the observer, the colours appear reversed compared to the primary bow. The secondary rainbow is fainter than the primary because more light escapes from two reflections compared to one and because the rainbow itself is spread over a greater area of the sky. Each rainbow reflects white light inside its coloured bands, but that is [...] "down" [...] for the primary and [...] "up" [...] for the secondary. [...] The dark area of unlit sky lying between the primary and secondary bows is called Alexander's band, after Alexander of Aphrodisias who first described it.|$|E
50|$|In theory, every rainbow is a circle, {{but from}} the ground, only its upper half can be seen. Since the rainbow's centre is {{diametrically}} opposed to the sun's position in the sky, more of the circle comes into view as the sun approaches the horizon, meaning that the largest section of the circle normally seen is about 50% during sunset or sunrise. Viewing the rainbow's lower half requires the presence of water droplets below the observer's horizon, as well as sunlight that is able to reach them. These requirements are not usually met when the viewer is at ground level, either because droplets are absent in the required position, or because the sunlight is obstructed by the landscape behind the observer. From a high viewpoint such as a high building or an aircraft, however, the requirements can be met and the full-circle rainbow can be seen. Like a partial rainbow, the circular rainbow can have a <b>secondary</b> <b>bow</b> or supernumerary bows as well. It is possible to produce the full circle when standing on the ground, for example by spraying a water mist from a garden hose while facing away from the sun.|$|E
40|$|The {{existence}} of a <b>secondary</b> <b>bow</b> is confirmed for 13 C+ 12 C nuclear rainbow scattering {{in addition to the}} 16 O+ 12 C system. This is found by studying the experimental angular distribution of 13 C+ 12 C scattering at the incident 13 C energy E_L= 250 MeV with an extended double folding (EDF) model that describes all the diagonal and off-diagonal coupling potentials derived from the microscopic wave functions for 12 C using a density-dependent nucleon-nucleon force. The Airy minimum at θ ≈ 70 ^∘, which is not reproduced by a conventional folding potential, is revealed to be a <b>secondary</b> <b>bow</b> generated dynamically by a coupling to the excited state 2 + (4. 44 MeV) of 12 C. The essential importance of the quadruple Y 2 term (reorientation term) of potential of the excited state 2 + of 12 C for the emergence of a <b>secondary</b> <b>bow</b> is found. The mechanism of the <b>secondary</b> <b>bow</b> is intuitively explained by showing how the trajectories are refracted dynamically into the classically forbidden angular region beyond the rainbow angle of the primary rainbow.

40|$|This {{invention}} relates {{generally to}} control systems for controlling crystal growth, and more particularly to such a system which uses {{a beam of light}} refracted by the fluid in which crystals are growing to detect concentration of solutes in the liquid. In a hanging drop apparatus, a laser beam is directed onto drop which refracts the laser light into primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>bows,</b> respectively, which in turn fall upon linear diode detector arrays. As concentration of solutes in drop increases due to solvent removal, these bows move farther apart on the arrays, with the relative separation being detected by arrays and used by a computer to adjust solvent vapor transport from the drop. A forward scattering detector is used to detect crystal nucleation in drop, and a humidity detector is used, in one embodiment, to detect relative humidity in the enclosure wherein drop is suspended. The novelty of this invention lies in utilizing angular variance of light refracted from drop to infer, by a computer algorithm, concentration of solutes therein. Additional novelty is believed to lie in using a forward scattering detector to detect nucleating crystallites in drop...|$|R
50|$|Alexander's band or Alexander's {{dark band}} is an optical {{phenomenon}} associated with rainbows which {{was named after}} Alexander of Aphrodisias who first described it in 200 AD. It occurs due to the deviation angles of the primary and <b>secondary</b> rainbows. Both <b>bows</b> exist due to an optical effect called the angle of minimum deviation. The refractive index of water prevents light from being deviated at smaller angles.|$|R

Chishima was armed with two 76 mm guns in sponsons on each side, with a fifth gun mounted in the <b>bows.</b> <b>Secondary</b> armament consisted of six 37 mm 1-pounder guns mounted in pairs on the bridge, poop deck and one on each side. In addition, she carried five torpedoes, mounted on the deck.|$|R

The bows on two sunny days (3 and 6 June 2008) were {{produced by the}} fountain in the Parque de las Ciencias, Granada, Spain, that consists of a rectangular perimeter of 40 spray nozzles. Optical thickness of the spray from each nozzle was approxi-mately 0. 5. Spectral purity of the primary bow was highest for orange and blue, reaching values of 23 % and 7 %, respectively, while skylight 90 ° from the Sun had a color purity of 34 % (on 6 June). The <b>secondary</b> <b>bow</b> hadmuch lower color purity with red absent because the regions around the bows and in Alexander’s dark band were pale blue.

40|$|Hubble Space Telescope {{observations}} show bright {{knots of}} Hα emission within outflowing young stellar jets. Velocity {{variations in the}} flow create <b>secondary</b> <b>bow</b> shocks that may intersect and lead to enhanced emission. When the bow shocks intersect at or above a certain critical angle, a planar shock called a Mach stem is formed. These shocks could produce brighter Hα emission since the incoming flow to the Mach stem {{is parallel to the}} shock normal. In this paper we report first results of a study using 2 -D numerical simulations designed to explore Mach stem formation at the intersection of bow shocks formed by hypersonic "bullets" or "clumps". Our 2 -D simulations show how the bow shock shapes and intersection angles change as the adiabatic index γ changes. We show that the formation or lack of a Mach stem in our simulations is consistent with the steady-state Mach stem formation theory. Our ultimate goal, which is part of an ongoing research effort, is to characterize the physical and observational consequences of bow shock intersections including the formation of Mach stems...|$|E
50|$|Hurling stones with a sling demanded little {{equipment}} or practice {{in order to}} be effective. <b>Secondary</b> to the <b>bow</b> and arrow in battle, the sling was rarely depicted. The first drawings date to the 20th century BC. Made of perishable materials, few ancient slings have survived. It relied on the impact the missile made and like most impact weapons was relegated to play a subsidiary role. In the hands of lightly armed skirmishers it was used to distract the attention of the enemy. One of its main advantages was the easy availability of ammunition in many locations. When lead became more widely available during the Late Period, sling bullets were cast. These were preferred to pebbles because of their greater weight which made them more effective. They often bore a mark.|$|R
30|$|Bilateral stress {{fractures}} of the ulna {{are very}} rare {{and have been}} reported on two occasions in adolescent patients in the literature. In the paper by Sujino et al. [17], a 15  year old adolescent male Japanese fencing player developed bilateral stress fractures of the ulna following his first training camp. In this type of fencing activity, the player grasps the special sword, which weighs about 500  g and is 115  cm long with both hands, and swings {{it up and down}} repeatedly. Stress fractures of both ulnae have been reported secondary to using crutches [17 – 19]. Steunbrink et al. [20] reported the first bilateral stress fractures of the ulna in an adult in a weightlifter <b>secondary</b> to a <b>bowing</b> mechanism caused by the biceps and flexor muscles that generates a supination–flexion movement of the ulna, leading to recurrent microtrauma.|$|R
