A fifth person with neck and abdominal injuries was also taken to hospital. The other 11 riders were believed to have only minor injuries and received medical treatment at the scene. This has been stated to be the biggest incident to ever occur at Alton Towers. The theme park was closed until 7 June 2015 pending the completion of the investigation. As of September, it had begun testing with both empty carriages and ones filled with test dummies. Ride staff operating The Smiler {{at the time of the}} incident were questioned, including the ride operator and engineer, after reports that it was manually restarted, in similar fashion to the Alton mouse during its incident in 1991. This accident also caused Sonic Spinball (roller coaster) and three other roller coasters at sister parks Thorpe Park and Chessington World of Adventures to close until additional safety procedures were researched or put in place, these rides reopened shortly afterwards, once deemed safe to continue operating. The Smiler reopened on March 19, 2016.

40|$|Background: Despite the {{increasing}} worldwide use of {{global positioning system}} (GPS) telemetry in wildlife research, {{it has never been}} tested on any freshwater diving animal or in the peculiar conditions of the riparian habitat, despite this latter being {{one of the most important}} habitat types for many animal taxa. Moreover, in most cases, the GPS devices used have been commercial and expensive, limiting their use in low-budget projects. Methodology/Principal Findings: We have developed a low-cost, easily constructed GPS GSM/GPRS (Global System for Mobile Communications/General Packet Radio Service) and examined its performance in <b>stationary</b> <b>tests,</b> by assessing the influence of different habitat types, including the riparian, as well as water submersion and certain climatic and environmental variables on GPS fix-success rate and accuracy. We then tested the GPS on wild diving animals, applying it, for the first time, to an otter species (Lutra lutra). The rate of locations acquired during the <b>stationary</b> <b>tests</b> reached 63. 2 %, with an average location error of 8. 94 m (SD = 8. 55). GPS performance in riparian habitats was principally affected by water submersion and secondarily by GPS inclination and position within the riverbed. Temporal and spatial correlations of location estimates accounted for some variation in the data sets. GPS-tagged otters also provided accurate locations and an even higher GPS fix-success rate (68. 2 %). Conclusions/Significance: Our results suggest that GPS telemetry is reliably applicable to riparian and even divin...|$|R
40|$|Wireless {{equipment}} {{based on}} the IEEE 802. 11 standard have enjoyed widespread success during recent years. Traditionally, such equipment have mainly been used indoors to allow users to wirelessly connect to the Internet or a LAN. By using directional antennas the range of 802. 11 equipment can be extended to reach several kilometers outdoors, expanding the areas of usage and applications for the 802. 11 standard. This thesis evaluates of the shelf equipment based on 802. 11 {{in a variety of}} situations, including both <b>stationary</b> and mobility <b>tests.</b> Performance tests of distances of up to 2000 meters have been possible to perform by connecting directional antennas to standard access points. Furthermore, a number of different transport layer protocols have been tested in order to cover a broad spectrum of the various types of applications that can come into consideration. Knowledge of distance limitations for this type of equipment and the performance impact of different transport layer protocols is of interest for the missile test range, RFN, in order to see if it is possible to use standard off the shelf equipment for some tasks during test activities. The results of the <b>stationary</b> <b>tests</b> show that the access points used in this thesis perform very well up to the maximum distance tested (2000 meters). Of the four TCP variants tested TCP Vegas is the overall winner, combining high throughput with noticeably fewer frames retransmitted by the access points. For UDP, few packet losses and low jitter were seen in general. As for the mobility tests, speeds of up to 100 kph, although leading to more retransmitted frames by the access points, showed promising results for both TCP and UDP with high throughput and only marginally higher delays than for the <b>stationary</b> <b>tests.</b> Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R

This study aimed to assess the performance and accu-racy of commercially available GPS data loggers for the first time using the same methods applied to test built-in wildlife GPS. The effects of antenna position, fix interval and habitat on the fix-success rate (FSR) and location error (LE) of CatLog data loggers were investi-gated in <b>stationary</b> <b>tests,</b> whereas the effects of animal movements on these errors were investigated in motion tests.
