5000|$|A guard llama is a llama, guanaco, alpaca or hybrid {{that is used}} {{in farming}} to protect sheep, goats, hens or other {{livestock}} from coyotes, dogs, foxes and other predators.

500|$|Harold Adams Innis {{was born}} in 1894 on a <b>small</b> <b>livestock</b> and dairy farm near the {{community}} of Otterville in southwestern Ontario's Oxford County. As a boy he loved the rhythms and routines of farm life and he never forgot his rural origins. His mother, Mary Adams Innis, had named him 'Herald', hoping he would become a minister in the strict evangelical Baptist faith {{that she and her}} husband William shared. At the time, the Baptist Church was an important part of life in rural areas. It gave isolated families a sense of community and embodied the values of individualism and independence. Its far-flung congregations were not ruled by a centralized, bureaucratic authority. Innis became an agnostic in later life, but never lost his interest in religion. According to his friend and biographer Donald Creighton, Innis's character was moulded by the Church: ...|$|E
500|$|The caracal is {{categorised}} as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN); African {{populations are}} listed under CITES Appendix II while Asian populations come under CITES Appendix I. In central, west, north and northeast Africa and Asia, the {{major threat to}} the survival of the caracal is habitat loss due to agricultural expansion and desertification. Caracal are often killed in retaliation for preying on <b>small</b> <b>livestock.</b> A 1989 survey revealed that the caracal was responsible for the elimination of nearly 5.3 livestock per [...] per year in the erstwhile Cape Province, South Africa. During 1931–52, the number of caracals killed averaged 2,219 per year in the Karoo. Some tribes kill it for its meat. As of 1996, hunting of caracals is prohibited in Afghanistan, Algeria, Egypt, India, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Lebanon, Morocco, Pakistan, Syria, Tajikistan, Tunisia, Turkey, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. However, Namibia and South Africa recognise it as a [...] "problem animal" [...] (vermin) and allow its hunting to protect livestock. Caracals occur in a number of protected areas across their range.|$|E

2500|$|The fox is {{sometimes}} referred to as vermin but it is not categorized as such by The UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). Some farmers fear the loss of their <b>smaller</b> <b>livestock,</b> while others consider them an ally in controlling rabbits, voles, and other rodents, which eat crops. A key reason for dislike of the fox by pastoral farmers is their tendency to commit acts of surplus killing toward animals such as chickens, yet having killed many they eat only one.

40|$|Individuals {{looking to}} begin a part time {{agricultural}} endeavor or existing farmers and ranchers looking to diversify, can potentially find value in <b>small</b> scale <b>livestock</b> operations. In many cases <b>small</b> scale <b>livestock</b> operations are attractive to individuals with objectives such as to provide livestock experiences for their children or to be an outlet for their love of animals. Individuals motivated to become involved with livestock and have {{a small amount of}} land or financial capital to invest, other employment, or time constraints may find that a <b>small</b> scale <b>livestock</b> enterprise can fit within their resource constraints. ^ Enterprise budgets were developed for small scale cow-calf, dairy steer, sheep, goat, and turkey operations. The scale of the enterprises were assumed to be 50 cow units, 25 dairy steers, 150 ewe units, 100 doe units and 1, 000 turkeys. National data for input costs and market selling prices were used when available and supplemented with published prices from 2011 Extension budgets when necessary. Enterprise budgets yielded positive profits of $ 6. 37 and $ 82. 99 per unit respectively for sheep and goat operations. Cow-calf, dairy steer, and turkeys were found to have negative profits per unit of -$ 116. 11, -$ 158. 69, and -$ 2. 38 per unit per unit respectively. The negative profit projections from this analysis provide evidence that <b>small</b> scale <b>livestock</b> operations often do not make sense from a business perspective when using profitability as the sole entry criteria. ^ Acknowledging that the livestock enterprise entry decision is not purely a profit maximizing decision, it becomes important for decision assistance tools to address both qualitative and quantitative components of livestock enterprises. Budgets were used as the quantitative base to develop a decision support tool to assist individuals make an informed “yes or no” <b>small</b> scale <b>livestock</b> entry decision and if yes, to choose the most appropriate specie for their enterprise. The Comparative Decision Support (CDS) matrix utilizes principles from linear programming to return the maximum number of units per livestock type that can be supported given user input constraints. Estimated profitability, operating expenses, and total labor hours per enterprise are compared across enterprises. The need for a permanent structure, intensity of labor, and type of market access needed to sell animals are also provided. The user takes this multi-dimensional information and is able to compare and contrast enterprises to make an informed decision. In one instance, a couple chose a cow-calf enterprise because of their access to a traditional livestock market, low labor intensity, and use of all acreage. In this example, the CDS tool provided realistic expectations on multiple attributes of <b>small</b> scale <b>livestock</b> enterprises to enable the user to make an informed entry decision. ...|$|R
