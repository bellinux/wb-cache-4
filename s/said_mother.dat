25|$|Born Millicent Lilian Entwistle in Port Talbot, Glamorgan, Wales, to English parents Emily Entwistle (née Stevenson) and Robert Symes Entwistle, {{she spent}} her early life in West Kensington, London. It is often {{reported}} that her mother {{died when she was}} very young, but there is no documented evidence supporting this. There is, however, a Last Will and Testament dated 15 December 1922, in the Entwistle family archives, in which Robert Entwistle specifically stated thatMillicent Lilian Entwistle is the daughter of my first wife whom I divorced and the custody of my said daughter was awarded to me. I do not desire my said daughter to be {{at any time in the}} custody or control of her <b>said</b> <b>mother.</b>|$|E
500|$|After Mother 3, Shigesato Itoi {{declared}} that he {{was done with the}} series. In response to Nintendo's seeming indifference to another Mother sequel, fans began to develop their own entry, Mother 4, in October 2010. As of September 2016, the Mother 4 development team had not received a cease and desist letter from Nintendo. In a preview of the game, Jason Schreier of Kotaku <b>said</b> <b>Mother</b> 4 looked [...] "stunning", as [...] "everything you could possibly want out of a new Mother game", from the music to the environment design. The fan-made game was planned for release in 2014 but has been delayed twice. No future release date has been set. Mother 4 will be playable as a standalone game, without need for an emulator. In March 2017, however, the team announced that as a preventative measure from getting taken down, the game would be rebranded, with 'Mother 4' no longer being the title of the game, and all direct references to the Mother series, like Mr. Saturn, removed. The decision came after many recent fan games received a DMCA notice.|$|E
500|$|While Parish <b>said</b> <b>Mother</b> {{script was}} [...] "as sharp as EarthBound", {{he felt that}} the original's game {{mechanics}} did not meet the same level of quality. Mother lacked the [...] "rolling HP counter" [...] and non-random encounters for which later entries in the series were known. Parish also found the game's balance to be uneven, as the statistical character attributes and level of difficulty scaled incorrectly with the game's progression. Rose Colored Gaming, a company that made custom reproductions of the NES cartridge, noted that the Japanese release's was more challenging than the unreleased English localization. RPGamer Ramos similarly found balance issues, with a high amount of battles, difficult enemies, reliance on grinding, and some oversized levels. Parish wrote earlier for 1UP.com that in comparison to EarthBound, Mother is [...] "worse in just about every way", a clone where its sequel was [...] "a satirical deconstruction of RPGs". He wrote that the game's historical significance is not for its actual game but for the interest it generated in video game emulation and the preservation of unreleased games.|$|E

2500|$|In 1893 Lady Aberdeen (1857–1939), {{head of the}} National Council of Women of Canada (NCWC), <b>said</b> <b>mothering</b> was the [...] "grand woman's mission".

500|$|Upholding {{the concept}} of jus soli (citizenship based on place of birth), the Court held that the Citizenship Clause needed to be {{interpreted}} in light of English common law, which had included as subjects virtually all native-born children, excluding only those who were born to foreign rulers or diplomats, born on foreign public ships, or born to enemy forces engaged in hostile occupation of the country's territory. [...] The court's majority held that the subject to the jurisdiction phrase in the Citizenship Clause excluded from U.S. citizenship only those persons covered by one of these three exceptions (plus a fourth [...] "single additional exception"—namely, that Indian tribes [...] "not taxed" [...] were not considered subject to U.S. jurisdiction). [...] The majority concluded {{that none of these}} four exceptions to U.S. jurisdiction applied to Wong; in particular, they observed that [...] "during all the time of their said residence in the United States, as domiciled residents therein, the <b>said</b> <b>mother</b> and father of said Wong Kim Ark were engaged in the prosecution of business, and were never engaged in any diplomatic or official capacity under the emperor of China".|$|E
500|$|Famitsu reviewers {{noted the}} level of detail from the game's direction, {{accessibility}} and wit of the story, unconventional art style, and conventional game mechanics. They considered the timed battles to be both useful and difficult. Eurogamer Simon Parkin detailed the 12-year development, the series' legacy as both [...] "one of Japan's most beloved" [...] and the video game cognoscenti's [...] "sacred cow", and the endurance of its fan community. He {{was impressed by the}} quality of the fan translation, and described Itoi as a [...] "storyteller" [...] who chose the Japanese role-playing game medium to tell his story. Parkin noted how the [...] "excellent" [...] script unfurled from a [...] "straightforward tale" [...] into [...] "breadth and depth of quality that few titles many times its budget achieve" [...] with [...] "affecting scenes" [...] and [...] "unexpected impact". He compared the chapter approach with the method of Dragon Quest IV. Parkin wrote that the script allowed for the somewhat [...] "heavy-handed" [...] juxtaposition of [...] "nature and technology, feudalism and capitalism, individuals and community", and that what he first considers a name customization [...] "trick" [...] becomes useful later in the game. NGC Magazine Mark Green wrote that the game felt like Mother 2.5 in its look and feel, which he did not consider negative, albeit somewhat antiquated. Lada of TechnologyTell <b>said</b> <b>Mother</b> 3 was surprisingly [...] "darker" [...] than its forebears.|$|E
2500|$|Mother Jones {{claimed that}} none of the {{documents}} revealed efforts by federal law enforcement agencies to disband the Occupy camps, and that the documents did not provide much evidence that federal officials attempted to suppress protesters' free speech rights.

2500|$|Jones was ideologically {{separated}} {{from many of}} the other female activists of the pre-Nineteenth Amendment days due to her aversion to female suffrage. She was quoted as saying that [...] "you don't need the vote to raise hell!" [...] Her opposition to women taking an active role in politics was based on her belief that the neglect of motherhood was a primary cause of juvenile delinquency. She became known as a charismatic and effective speaker throughout her career. A passionate public speaker, she would liven up her rhetoric with real and folk-tale characters and humor-ridden methods to rile the crowd, making use of profanity, name-calling, and wit. Occasionally she would include props, visual aids, and dramatic stunts for effect. Her oratory usually involved the relating of some personal tale in which she invariably [...] "showed up" [...] one form of authority or another. She once addressed a group of strikers who had just left a church where the priest had preached that they should all return to work, and that their reward would be in heaven. Mother Jones, addressing this same crowd in an open field, reminded them that they were striking so that they and their families could get a bit of heaven [...] before they died. She disdained priests and ministers, referring to them as [...] "sky pilots". Professing to be an agnostic, she said that [...] "labor must be its own religion". It is <b>said</b> <b>Mother</b> Jones spoke in a pleasant-sounding brogue which projected well. When she grew excited, her [...] voice didn't grow shrill. Instead, it dropped in pitch, and her intensity became all but palpable.|$|E
