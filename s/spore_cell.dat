The anther-specific chalcone synthase-like (ASCL) enzyme of Physcomitrella patens, PpASCL, has previously been implicated in the biosynthesis of sporopollenin, the main constituent of exine and perine, the two outermost layers of the moss <b>spore</b> <b>cell</b> wall. We made targeted knockouts of the corresponding gene, PpASCL, and phenotypically characterized ascl sporophytes and spores at different developmental stages. Ascl plants developed normally until late in sporophytic development, when the spores produced were structurally aberrant and inviable. The development of the ascl <b>spore</b> <b>cell</b> wall appeared to be arrested early in microspore development, resulting in small, collapsed spores with altered surface morphology. The typical stratification of the <b>spore</b> <b>cell</b> wall was absent with only an abnormal perine recognisable above an amorphous layer possibly representing remnants of compromised intine and/or exine. Equivalent resistance of the spore walls of ascl mutants and the control strain to acetolysis suggests the presence of chemically inert, defective sporopollenin in the mutants.

40|$|The {{individual}} amoebae composing of Dictyostelium aggregate can differentiate {{into either}} stalk or spore cells according, it is believed, to the extracellular signals they receive. By inducing the differentiation of isolated cells {{we hope to}} identify these signals. It is shown here that wild-type cells can differentiate into prespore cells in a solution of cAMP plus salts supplemented by conditioned medium. Cell-to-cell contact is not required. More important, isolated cells of various sporogenous mutant strains form spores in similar conditions without needing conditioned medium at all. For these strains at least, cAMP is the sole inducer necessary for spore formation. Earlier work has shown that stalk cells are induced {{by a combination of}} cAMP and a low molecular weight factor, differentiation inducing factor (DIF). DIF now appears to be the only pathway-specific inducer involved in the differentiation of sporogenous amoebae and DIF levels in the aggregate may therefore determine whether an amoeba becomes a stalk or a <b>spore</b> <b>cell.</b> In suitable conditions some sporogenous mutants form migrating slugs having an anterior/posterior pattern of prestalk and prespore cells.

40|$|Terminal {{differentiation}} of both stalk and <b>spore</b> <b>cells</b> in Dictyostelium can {{be triggered by}} activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). A screen for mutants where stalk and <b>spore</b> <b>cells</b> mature in isolation produced three genes which may act as negative regulators of PKA: rdeC (encoding the PKA regulatory subunit), regA and rdeA. The biochemical properties of RegA were studied in detail. One domain is a cAMP phosphodiesterase (Km approximately 5 microM); the other is homologous to response regulators (RRs) of two-component signal transduction systems. It can accept phosphate from acetyl phosphate in a reaction typical of RRs, with transfer dependent on Asp 212, the predicted phosphoacceptor. RegA phosphodiesterase activity is stimulated up to 8 -fold by the phosphodonor phosphoramidate, with stimulation again dependent on Asp 212. This indicates that phosphorylation of the RR domain activates the phosphodiesterase domain. Overexpression of the RR domain in wild-type cells phenocopies a regA null. We interpret this dominant-negative effect as due to a diversion of the normal flow of phosphates from RegA, thus preventing its activation. Mutation of rdeA is known to produce elevated cAMP levels. We propose that cAMP breakdown is controlled by a phosphorelay system which activates RegA, and may include RdeA. Cell maturation should be triggered when this system is inhibited...|$|R

PCR-based and Southern analysis of various actinomycetes, supported by analysis of genome sequences, revealed mreB homologues only in genera that form an aerial mycelium and sporulate. We analysed MreB in one such organism, Streptomyces coelicolor. Ectopic overexpression of mreB impaired growth, and caused swellings and lysis of hyphae. A null mutant with apparently normal vegetative growth was generated. However, aerial hyphae of this mutant were swelling and lysing; spores doubled their volume and lost their characteristic resistance to stress conditions. Loss of cell wall consistency was observed in MreB-depleted spores by transmission electron microscopy. An MreB–EGFP fusion was constructed to localize MreB in the mycelium. No clearly localized signal was seen in vegetative mycelium. However, strong fluorescence was observed at the septa of sporulating aerial hyphae, then as bipolar foci in young spores, and finally in a ring- or shell-like pattern inside the spores. Immunogold electron microscopy using MreB-specific antibodies revealed that MreB is located immediately underneath the internal spore wall.

Spores that did not inherit ade 2 - or FM 4 - 64 -labeled vacuoles did generate an organelle that could be visualized by subsequent staining with vacuole-specific fluorophores.

SCO 4439 harbors a DD-CPase domain and a putative transcriptional regulator domain, separated by a putative transmembrane region. The recombinant protein shows that DD-CPase activity is inhibited by penicillin G. The spores of the SCO 4439 ::Tn 5062 mutant are affected in their resistance to heat and acid and showed a dramatic increase in swelling during germination. The mycelium of the SCO 4439 ::Tn 5062 mutant is more sensitive to glycopeptide antibiotics (vancomycin and teicoplanin). The DD-CPase domain and the hydrophobic transmembrane region are highly conserved in Streptomyces, and both are essential for complementing the wild type phenotypes in the mutant. A model for the biological mechanism behind the observed phenotypes is proposed, in which SCO 4439 DD-CPase releases D-Ala from peptidoglycan (PG) precursors, thereby reducing the substrate pool for PG crosslinking (transpeptidation). PG crosslinking regulates spore physical resistance and germination, and modulates mycelium resistance to glycopeptides.

Upon translocation to the membrane, this pleckstrin homology (PH) domain protein stimulates ACA and thereby mediates developmental aggregation. CRAC {{may also have}} roles later in development since CRAC-null cells can respond to chemotactic signals and participate in developmental aggregation when admixed with wild-type cells, {{but they do not}} complete development within such chimeras. To test whether the role of CRAC in postaggregative development is related to the {{activation of}} ACA, chemotactic aggregation was bypassed in CRAC-null cells by activating the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). While such strains formed mounds, they did not complete fruiting body morphogenesis or form spores. Expression of CRAC in the prespore cells of these strains rescued sporulation and fruiting body formation. This later function of CRAC does not appear to require its PH domain since the C-terminal portion of the protein (CRAC-ΔPH) can substitute for full-length CRAC in promoting <b>spore</b> <b>cell</b> formation and morphogenesis. No detectable ACA activation was observed in any of the CRAC-null strains rescued by PKA activation and expression of CRAC-ΔPH. Finally, we found that the development of CRAC-null ACA-null double mutants could be rescued by the activation of PKA together with the expression of CRAC-ΔPH. Thus, {{there appears to be a}} required function for CRAC in postaggregative development that is independent of its previously described function in the ACA activation pathway...|$|E

Spore development is characterized into six stages, initiation from epidermal cell and formation of sporogenous cells, primary sporogenous cell, secondary sporogenous <b>cell,</b> <b>spore</b> mother <b>cell,</b> tetrad, and maturation.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} and cellular differentiation of Dictyostelium discoideum are disrupted in transformants secreting {{high levels of}} the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase. The aggregation of these cells in the early stage of development proceeds rapidly and without the formation of organized streams. The later stages of development, in which differentiation into stalk and <b>spore</b> <b>cells</b> normally takes place, are completely blocked so that the transformants remain in spherical clusters of undifferentiated cells that do not elaborate the tip structure that regulates morphogenesis. These effects are due to overproduction of extracellular phosphodiesterase and demonstrate the role of cAMP during the aggregation phase of development {{as well as in}} the control of differentiation and pattern formation...|$|R
