Certain parallels were also noted in analysis of variance and principal component analysis. EDUCATIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT 1980, 40 GAYLORD (1969) has presented formulas that clarify the relation-ships among item intercorrelations, item-test correlations, and test re-liability. The purpose of this note is to give an alternative derivation of his formulas and to point out certain parallels in analysis of vari-ance and principal component analysis. Following Tryon (1957), we may express the variance of a test ei-ther in terms of item variances and covariances (Equation 1) or in terms of item-test covariances (Equation 2) : where t denotes the test and i and j denote individual items.

40|$|Objectives. To {{describe}} {{a new survey}} tool for assessing medical group capability to improve care and to test the relationship between survey scores and other factors among 41 medical groups. Methods. The 30 factors and strategies that experienced quality improvement leaders ranked as most important for successful implementation were incorporated in a questionnaire. The scores from 41 medical directors on this Change Process Capability Questionnaire (CPCQ) in relation to depression improvement were correlated with organizational factors. Results. On a 5 -point response scale, there was high variation on nearly all CPCQ <b>items</b> (<b>standard</b> <b>deviation,</b> 0. 59 - 1. 63) and for overall scores for factors and strategies. The total CPCQ score also correlated highly with organi-zational priority for depression improvement {{as well as with}} the presence of overall systems for depression care. Conclusions. This measure appears to distin-guish among medical groups and to demonstrate an association with both change priorities and imple-mented systems for depression.

40|$|Statistical {{procedures}} {{employed in}} item analysis {{are based on}} the performance of the individual on a given test. If, however, one desires to assess the efficiency of some treatment, the researcher is interested in the performance of groups of students who received the treatment rather than in the performance of any one individual. In such cases statistics based on individual performance do not constitute a proper basis fcr item selection and for interpretation of test results. In this context, therefore, the discrimination power of an item should be conceived as its capacity to discriminate among classes and not among individuals. This approach is not only logically sound, but also increases {{the quantity and quality of}} the information available. Three new parameters are introduced: item-test correlation based on class data, <b>item</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> based on class data, and the intraclass correlation coefficient of an item. An item analysis of a fourth grade arithmetic test is used as an example. Other class data parameters are suggested for future research. (DG...|$|R
40|$|A {{key issue}} to {{address in the}} design and {{implementation}} of any assessment system is ensuring its reliabil-ity and validity. University assessment policies often require staff to prepare parallel examinations for students who are unable to sit the initial examination. There is little published literature to give confidence to staff or students that these examinations are indeed reliable or equivalent. This study was conducted to determine the validity, reliability and equivalence of two parallel examinations that have been developed under highly defined quality assurance (QA) processes in a university setting. Collated assessment results for all the 76 participants who sat the parallel examinations were subjected to statistical and correlational analysis to test for significant differences between mean scores and their associated <b>standard</b> <b>deviations.</b> <b>Item</b> analysis was conducted for each assessment by computing the difficulty index (DIF), discrimination index (DI) and Kuder-Richardson 20 (KR- 20) reliability using classical test theory. Results indicated comparative proportions of difficulty, functional distractors and internal consistency of the assessment items on both examinations. Comparison of student performances in both examinations revealed that {{there was no significant difference}} in mean scores. However, a highly positive and significant correlation (r = 0. 82) between student total scores in both examinations was evident. Approximately two thirds (62. 5 %) of students with low scores in the first examination also achieved low scores in the second examina...|$|R
40|$|The {{logic and}} uses of test equating are discussed, {{including}} three methods of test equating. The {{focus is on}} the conceptual underpinnings of each test equating method, rather than on the mathematics of the procedures. Additional consideration is given to the assumptions of each method and its respective strengths and weaknesses. A commonly accepted definition of equivalent scores is based on the concept of equipercentile equating. The first step is to determine the percentile ranks of the distribution of scores on both instruments. The percentile ranks are then plotted against the raw scores for each instrument, and once they are graphed, equivalent scores can be obtained from the graph. The linear equating method {{is based on the assumption}} that the two forms of the test, which are designed to be parallel, will have essentially the same raw-score distributions, apart from minor differences in the mean and <b>standard</b> <b>deviations.</b> <b>Item</b> response theory (IRT), or latent trait theory, is an attempt to measure a person's performance on a test item as a function of the difficulty of the item and the examinee's performance on some unobserved, or latent, trait. The three IRT models are discussed, and conditions under which all equating methods are similar are reviewed. (Contains 1 table, 2 figures, and 18 references.)

40|$|The {{goals of}} the present study were to {{construct}} a short scale of global identity that would have cross-cultural validity, and examine the latent factor structure of this scale. Four studies were conducted. Based on the literature review (Study 1) and data collected from students from several countries in open-ended questions (Study 2), an extensive item pool was produced. The item pool was then evaluated by experts (Study 3), resulting in total trial item pool of 110 Likert-type items. The questionnaire was then administered together with a social desirability scale to three different samples of students: Norwegian, Turkish, and American (Study 4). Items were ranked based on their performances on 22 psychometric criteria. The criteria were <b>items</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> and item-total correlations for each sample, the length of items in word and characters for both the English and the Turkish version, items frequency of omission in each sample, items correlations with a multicultural index, social desirability, and cosmopolitan behavior in each sample. The highest 24 ranked items were subjected to item analysis, resulting in a 12 item Global Identity Scale that had high Cronbach alpha across samples. Factor analysis of the 12 item scale yielded a 2 factor orthogonal structure that was stable across the three samples of the study. One of the subscales of the Global Identity Scale represented lack of national attachment, and the other represented cosmopolitan orientation.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 There are not {{adequate}} human factors research studies available that examine luminance-based measures {{as they relate}} to human visual preference and acceptance in spaces with daylight. The objective of this research is to study several luminance-based metrics to support improved integrated lighting design recommendations, computational analysis methods and control technologies. Therefore, this dissertation executed a two-day pilot study (n= 18) and a six-month repeated-measures experiment (n= 45) in mock office spaces under naturally occurring daylight conditions in Boise, Idaho. Recent developments in High Dynamic Range digital photography permit investigation of high-resolution luminance-based metrics. Once these metrics and associated recommended criteria are established, they can support computational daylighting design analysis and integrated luminous environmental control systems to improve occupant satisfaction and increase energy savings over traditional illuminance-based methods. This dissertation also examined human visual performance differences in scenes rated as visually comfortable and those having "just uncomfortable glare. " This was done to determine if, and to what extent, visual performance decrements exist under uncomfortable conditions. Luminance-based metrics proved more capable than illuminance-based metrics at fitting the range of subjective responses on visual comfort <b>items.</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>deviation</b> of window luminance produced the highest adjusted squared correlation coefficient of any single metric with subjective responses (adj r 2 = 0. 38, F 1, 860 = 536, p-value adj R 2 = 0. 49, F 3, 688 = 222, p-value 2000 cd/m 2. Additionally, a significant decrement (0. 51 - 1. 65 %) in visual performance was found for one of three objective performance tests in glaring scenes. A significant "seasonal" effect was found for measured sensitivity to brightness between summer and fall using a controlled repeated-measures test. Finally, several human acceptance-based approaches to improve luminous environmental control systems are proposed...|$|R
