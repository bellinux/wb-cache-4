40|$|Eficiency of parasitization on larval host, Spodoptera litura (F.), by an endoparasitoid Snellenius (=Microplitis) manilae Ashmead in the laboratory. The armyworm, Spodoptera litura (F.) is {{the host}} of an endoparasitoid Snellenius manilae Ashmead. This {{research}} described the effect of host larval stage preference, the number of host exposure and the age of parasitoid on the resulting parasitization. Each group of the first to the fifth of host instar (30 larvae) was exposed for 3 hours to a pair of four-day old parasitoids in a trial cage. The same exposures were conducted without choices by placing each instar group within each trial cage. The parasitoid survival was observed by maintaining the parasitized larvae until adult emergence. Each group of 10, 20, 30 and 40 of the second instar larvae were exposed for 12 hours/day to a mated female parasitoid. This experiment was conducted from the first day old parasitoid until the females died. The percentage of parasitization, <b>superparasitization,</b> oviposition and the fecundity of adults were recorded. Each group of thirty second instar larvae was exposed separately to a mated female parasitoid of 1 to 9 days old. The survival of progeny was recorded. All treatments in this observation were repeated 10 times. S. manilae preferred to lay eggs on the third (41. 7 %) followed by the second (22. 3 %) instar larvae of S. litura. The lowest percentages of <b>superparasitization</b> obtained from the first and the second instar larvae were between 11 and 15 % and the highest percentage of <b>superparasitization</b> obtained from the fourth instar larvae was 52 %. The highest survival of parasitoid was found on the exposure of the second instar larvae which reached 16 %. The highest efficiency of parasitism (80. 9 %) was found on the twenty of the second instar larval exposure density which produced 59 % of optimal parasitization level, the average rate of egg laid by females was 25 eggs/day, and the fecundity was 185 eggs/female. Female parasitoids of 1 - 7 days old gave the same opportunity to produce progeny survival which was in the range of 10. 3 - 25. 7 %...|$|E
40|$|Plants {{attacked}} by herbivorous insects emit volatile compounds that attract predators or parasitoids of the herbivores. Plant fitness increases when these herbivorous insects are parasitized by solitary parasitoids, but whether gregarious koinobiont parasitoids also confer {{a benefit to}} plant fitness has been disputed. We investigated the relationship between parasitoid load of the gregarious Cotesia glomerata (L.) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), food consumption by larvae of their host Pieris brassicae L. (Lepidoptera: Pieridae), and seed production in a host plant, Brassica nigra L. (Brassicaceae), in a greenhouse experiment. Plants damaged by caterpillars containing single parasitoid broods produced a similar amount of seeds as undamaged control plants and produced significantly more seeds than plants with unparasitized caterpillars feeding on them. Increasing the parasitoid load to levels likely resulting from <b>superparasitization,</b> feeding by parasitized caterpillars was significantly negatively correlated with plant seed production. Higher parasitoid brood sizes were negatively correlated with pupal weight of Cotesia glomerata, revealing scramble competition leading to a fitness trade-off for the parasitoid. Our results suggest that in this tritrophic system plant fitness is higher when the gregarious parasitoid deposits a single brood into its herbivorous host. A prediction following from these results is that plants benefit from recruiting parasitoids when <b>superparasitization</b> is prevented. This is supported by our previous results on down-regulation of synomone production when Brassica oleracea was fed on by parasitized caterpillars of P. brassicae. We conclude that variable parasitoid loads in gregarious koinobiont parasitoids largely explain existing controversies about the putative benefit of recruiting these parasitoids for plant reproduction. ...|$|E
