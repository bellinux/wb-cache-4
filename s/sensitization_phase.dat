40|$|Contact {{hypersensitivity}} (CHS) requires {{activation of}} the innate immune system, and results in an adaptive immune response. Many cells of the innate immune system use Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which signal through the adaptor protein, MyD 88, to initiate an immune response. MyD 88 is also required for signaling downstream of the IL- 1 and Il- 18 receptors (IL- 1 R and IL- 18 R, respectively). Herein, we studied the MyD 88 signaling pathway in the CHS response to DNFB. Mice deficient in MyD 88 were unable to mount a CHS response to DNFB. In contrast, mice deficient in Toll/IL- 1 R-containing adaptor-inducing IFN-β, TLR 2, TLR 4, TLR 6, and TLR 9 had no defect {{in their ability to}} respond to DNFB. Although both IL- 1 R and IL- 18 R-deficient mice showed a reduced CHS response to DNFB, in bone marrow chimera and adoptive transfer experiments, we found that MyD 88 and the IL- 18 R were required in a radioresistant cell in the <b>sensitization</b> <b>phase</b> of the CHS response. In contrast, similar strategies revealed that the IL- 1 R was required in a radiosensitive cell in the <b>sensitization</b> <b>phase</b> of the CHS response. Taken together, these data indicate that the IL- 1 R and IL- 18 R/MyD 88 pathways are required in distinctly different cells during the <b>sensitization</b> <b>phase</b> of CHS...|$|E
40|$|Recently air {{pollutants}} and irritants have been labelled as possible exogenous {{risk factors for}} allergic disorders. Although {{the underlying causes of}} allergic disorders such as atopic dermatitis and asthma remain unclear, the T helper type 2 (Th 2) cell-mediated allergic inflammatory cascade may contribute to their pathogenesis. In the last decade, it has been documented that one of the candidates for triggering Th 2 commitment is thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), the expression of which is up-regulated in the lesions of allergic patients. Here, we describe TSLP function in a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) -induced contact hypersensitivity (CHS) model. A cytokine profile indicated that the model was dominantly mediated by the Th 2 milieu. Interestingly, TSLP was increased in the skin during the <b>sensitization</b> <b>phase</b> when stimulated by a solvent, dibutyl phthalate (DBP), but not by FITC hapten or another solvent, acetone. Ear swelling in FITC-induced CHS was totally abrogated by removing DBP from the sensitization or elicitation phase, and was restored by complementary injection of TSLP. Inversely, the ear swelling was suppressed by injection of small interfering RNA against TSLP during the <b>sensitization</b> <b>phase,</b> which was concomitant with decreasing expression of interleukin- 4 at the swollen skin site. Taken together, DBP-induced TSLP during the <b>sensitization</b> <b>phase</b> plays a role in establishing FITC-induced CHS and {{may be one of the}} causes of Th 2 commitment in the model, suggesting that certain environmental toxins, such as DBP, may endow pro-allergic and atopic predisposition in humans or animals...|$|E
40|$|Several {{studies suggest}} that the N/OFQ (nociceptin/orphanin FQ) -NOP (N/OFQ peptide) {{receptor}} pathway is involved in airway physiology. We previously demonstrated a modulation of the endogenous N/OFQ levels in allergen-sensitized mice. Here, we investigated the effects of NOP receptor activation in allergen sensitization using a murine model of allergen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). BALB/c mice were intraperitoneally treated with the NOP receptor agonist UFP- 112, either during the <b>sensitization</b> <b>phase</b> (30 min before ovalbumin administration) or at the end of sensitization process (15 min before bronchopulmonary reactivity evaluation). At day 21 from the first allergen exposure, bronchopulmonary reactivity and total and differential cell count in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were evaluated. In a separate set of experiments cell proliferation in lymphocytes, cytokine levels, IgE serum levels, and the effect of UFP- 112 on IL- 13 -induced AHR were evaluated. Pretreatment with UFP- 112, during the <b>sensitization</b> <b>phase,</b> caused a significant reduction in allergen-induced AHR and total cell lung infiltration. No effect on allergen-induced AHR was observed when the treatment was performed at the end of sensitization process, on tissues harvested from OVA-sensitized mice and on IL- 13 -induced AHR. The in vitro proliferative response of lymphocytes was significantly reduced by pretreatment during the <b>sensitization</b> <b>phase</b> with UFP- 112. This effect was paralleled by a significant modulation of cytokine secretion in pulmonary tissues and lymphocytes. In conclusion, we demonstrated a role for the NOP receptor and N/OFQ pathway in the AHR induced by allergen, probably through a modulation of the immune response that triggers the development of AHR that involves pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines...|$|E

In the present study, we hypothesized that OPS might attenuate intestinal inflammation associated with food allergy, a Th 2 -dominant immune disorder. BALB/c mice were sensitized twice with ovalbumin (OVA) absorbed to alum and then repeatedly challenged with intragastric OVA to induce intestinal allergic responses. The mice were administered by gavage with OPS and/or vehicle (distilled water) once/d during the two <b>sensitization</b> <b>phases,</b> and once every other day during the challenge phase. Administration with OPS attenuated OVA challenge-elicited diarrhea, and the infiltration of mast cells in the intestine. OPS demonstrated a protective effect on the reduced ratio of villus length over crypt depth of the intestine in allergic mice. Furthermore, OPS administration markedly attenuated the intestinal expression of the Th 2 signature cytokine interleukin- 4 (IL- 4). Collectively, these results demonstrated the in vivo antiallergic activity of OPS, which is associated with the suppression of allergen-induced intestinal Th 2 responses and mast cell activation...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{cyclosporin}} A (CyA) on the induction, expression and {{regulation of the}} immune response to the contact sensitivity agent 2, 4 -dinitroflouro-benzene, (DNFB) has been studied in BALB/c mice. CyA was administered orally during the <b>sensitization</b> <b>phase</b> or during the elicitation phase. The following results were obtained. CyA administered orally during the <b>sensitization</b> <b>phase</b> at a high dose resulted in a reduction of the contact sensitivity response. Feeding lower doses {{had no effect on}} the ear swelling response. CyA inhibited the ear swelling response if administered during the elicitation phase. In transfer experiments it was shown that the induction of the T-effector cell of delayed hypersensitivity (TDH) was insensitive to the suppressive action of CyA, while the effector function of this T-cell subpopulation was CyA-sensitive. T-suppressor (TS) cell response was studied in animals by inducing tolerance through epicutaneous application of an allergen overload and by transfer of TS cells induced by intravenous injection of the contact sensitizer.

40|$|Contact {{hypersensitivity}} (CHS) {{has been}} widely used to study cutaneous immune responses, as a prototype of delayed-type hypersensitivity. Although natural killer T (NKT) cells have been assumed to {{have an important role}} in CHS, their role is controversial. Here, we report the role of NKT cells in the <b>sensitization</b> <b>phase</b> of CHS, by promoting the survival and maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) in the draining lymph nodes (LNs). The CHS response was attenuated with Cd 1 d 1 −/− and Traj 18 −/− BALB/c mice in which NKT cells were absent. In the draining LNs, the number of effector T cells and cytokine production were significantly reduced with NKT cell–deficient mice. NKT cells activated and colocalized with DCs in the draining LNs after sensitization. The number of migrated and mature DCs was reduced in NKT cell–deficient mice 72 [*]hours after FITC application. In in vitro experiments, activated NKT cells enhanced bone marrow–derived DC (BMDC) survivability via tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production from BMDCs. In addition, TNF production from BMDCs was partially suppressed by the neutralizing anti-CD 54 or CD 154 antibodies. Our data demonstrate that DC–NKT interaction has a pivotal role in the <b>sensitization</b> <b>phase</b> of CHS...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{influence}} of glucocorticoids on the <b>sensitization</b> <b>phase</b> {{as well as on}} the cytolytic effector phase of an in vitro lymphocyte-mediated immune reaction. Lymphocytes obtained from the spleens or lymph nodes of unimmunized inbred rats were sensitized against foreign rat or mouse embryonic fibroblasts in cell culture. The capacity of the sensitized lymphocytes to produce a cytolytic effect was tested by transferring them to target fibroblast cultures. Injury to target fibroblasts was measured by release of radioactive 51 Cr from previously labeled fibroblasts or by direct count of viable fibroblasts after incubation with sensitized lymphocytes. Various concentrations of water-soluble hydrocortisone or prednisolone were added to cell cultures during the 5 day <b>sensitization</b> <b>phase</b> and/or during the subsequent cytolytic effector phase and {{the influence of}} these hormones on the number and cytolytic capacity of the lymphocytes was measured. During the <b>sensitization</b> <b>phase,</b> the presence of glucocorticoid hormones, at concentrations of about 1 µg/ml, led to a profound decrease in the total number of recoverable lymphocytes. However, the per cent of large transformed lymphocytes was much greater in these treated cultures. The antigen-specific cytolytic capacity per cell of the glucocorticoid-treated lymphocytes, after the hormone was removed, was several times greater than that of lymphocytes sensitized in the absence of added hormones. Glucocorticoids influenced the effector phase of the reaction by inhibiting lymphocyte-mediated injury to target fibroblasts. The hormones, at concentrations of about 1 µg/ml, inhibited the cytolytic effect by about 50 % without reducing the viability of the sensitized lymphocytes. Dose-dependent toxicity to lymphocytes and increasing inhibition of cytolytic effect appeared at higher concentrations of hormones. Thus, hydrocortisone and prednisolone, at concentrations of about 1 µg/ml, did not suppress the induction of sensitization, a process which they seem to facilitate in vitro. However, similar concentrations of these hormones appear to inhibit the cytolytic effector mechanism of sensitized lymphocytes. These findings may be relevant to the use of glucocorticoids as immunosuppressive agents in vivo...|$|E

40|$|Allergic contact {{dermatitis}} (ACD) {{is one of}} the most common skin diseases, consisting of <b>sensitization</b> and elicitation <b>phases.</b> With the advancement of technology and the discovery of new types of immune cells, our knowledge of the immunological mechanisms of contact hypersensitivity (CHS) as a murine model of ACD has expanded significantly in the past decade. For example, by introducing regulatory T cells, CD 4 + T-helper 17 cells, and Langerin-positive dermal dendritic cells, the initiation and termination mechanism of CHS has been revealed. In addition, the role of mast cells in CHS, long a matter of debate, has become apparent by developing conditional mast cell–deficient mice. Moreover, the role of the innate immunity system, such as that of Toll-like receptor signaling, has made a breakthrough in this field. In this review, we will integrate the recent advancement of immunological mechanisms of both the <b>sensitization</b> and elicitation <b>phases</b> of CHS into the classic view, and we will discuss updated mechanisms on its development and future directions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSensitization is {{a common}} feature of psychostimulants and {{sensitization}} effects are {{generally considered to be}} linked to the addictive properties of these drugs. We used a conventional paired/unpaired Pavlovian protocol to induce a context specific sensitization to the locomotor stimulant effect of a high dose of apomorphine (2. 0 mg/kg). Two days following a 5 session <b>sensitization</b> induction <b>phase,</b> a brief 5 min non-drug test for conditioning was conducted. Only the paired groups exhibited locomotor stimulant conditioned response effects. Immediately following this brief test for conditioning, the paired and the unpaired groups received injections of 0. 05 mg/kg apomorphine, 2. 0 mg/kg apomorphine or vehicle designed to differentially impact memory re-consolidation of the conditioning. Two days later, all groups received a sensitization challenge test with 2. 0 mg/kg apomorphine. The 2. 0 mg/kg apomorphine post-trial treatment potentiated sensitization while the 0. 05 mg/kg eliminated sensitization. These effects were only observed in the paired groups. The activation of dopaminergic systems by the high dose of apomorphine strengthened the drug/environment association whereas the inhibition of dopamine activity by the low auto-receptor dose eliminated this association. The results point to the importance of conditioning to context specific sensitization and targeting memory re-consolidation of conditioning as a paradigm to modify sensitization...|$|R
40|$|On {{exposure}} to UV-B, the epidermal component transurocanic acid (UCA) {{is not only}} photoisomerized into cis-UCA but will also, at least in part, be photooxidized into UCA oxidation products (UOPs). We hypothesized that UOPs can mimic UV-induced systemic immunosuppression comparable to the suppressive properties already established for cis-UCA. A crude mixture of UOPs showed a significant suppression of the <b>sensitization</b> <b>phase</b> of the systemic contact hypersensitivity (CHS) response to picryl chloride (PCl). Three of the UOPs were selected for this study: imidazole- 4 -carboxylic acid (ImCOOH), imidazole- 4 -carboxaldehyde (ImCHO) and imidazole- 4 -acetic acid (ImAc). Effects on the sensitization, elicitation and postelicitation phases of CHS to PCl in BALB/c mice were studied and compared {{with the effects of}} cis-UCA. ImCHO was equally effective at suppressing the <b>sensitization</b> <b>phase</b> as cis-UCA. The triplet combination of the imidazolles (1 : 1 : 1) showed more pronounced suppression than that induced by cis-UCA. The most effective compounds for the suppression of the elicitation phase appeared to be ImAc and cis-UCA. Significant suppression of the postelicitation phase was only obtained with the triplet combination of ImCHO, ImCOOH and ImAc, the combination that appeared to be effective at all three tested phases.

40|$|The role of {{mast cells}} (MCs) in contact {{hypersensitivity}} (CHS) remains controversial. This {{is due in}} part to the use of the MC-deficient Kit (W/Wv) mouse model, since Kit (W/Wv) mice congenitally lack other types of cells as a result of a point mutation in c-kit. A recent study indicated that the intronic enhancer (IE) for Il 4 gene transcription is essential for MCs but not in other cell types. The aim of this study is to re-evaluate the roles of MCs in CHS using mice in which MCs can be conditionally and specifically depleted. Transgenic Mas-TRECK mice in which MCs are depleted conditionally were newly generated using cell-type specific gene regulation by IE. Using this mouse, CHS and FITC-induced cutaneous DC migration were analyzed. Chemotaxis assay and cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ imaging were performed by co-culture of bone marrow-derived MCs (BMMCs) and bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs). In Mas-TRECK mice, CHS was attenuated when MCs were depleted during the <b>sensitization</b> <b>phase.</b> In addition, both maturation and migration of skin DCs were abrogated by MC depletion. Consistently, BMMCs enhanced maturation and chemotaxis of BMDC in ICAM- 1 and TNF-α dependent manners Furthermore, stimulated BMDCs increased intracellular Ca²⁺ of MC upon direct interaction and up-regulated membrane-bound TNF-α on BMMCs. These results suggest that MCs enhance DC functions by interacting with DCs in the skin to establish the <b>sensitization</b> <b>phase</b> of CHS...|$|E

Analysis of the parental strains revealed that this oestrogen-induced inhibition of DTH mice is a trait inherited from the healthy NZW and not from the autoimmune NZB strain. The down-regulating effect of oestradiol on DTH in female NZB/W mice was found both in the <b>sensitization</b> and effector <b>phase</b> of the DTH response. Decreased DTH reactivity to OXA was demonstrated in oophorectomized NZB/W and NZW mice after administration of both low, physiological doses (s. c. injections) and high, pharmacological doses (siliac tube implantation) of oestradiol. In addition, s. c. implantation of testosterone containing siliac tubes suppressed DTH reactivity to OXA in castrated male NZW mice. This down-regulating effect was not found in male NZB or NZB/W mice similarly treated. Serological analysis revealed that high doses of oestradiol increased whereas testosterone depressed the IgG anti-OXA antibody responses in female NZB/W mice.

In the present study, we aim to dissect the spatiotemporal differences in the roles of IL- 23 in an epicutaneously-sensitized asthma model of mice. MethodsC 57 BL/ 6 mice were sensitized to ovalbumin (OVA) by patch application on the skin, followed by airway exposure to aerosolized OVA. During sensitization and/or challenge phase, either a specific neutralizing antibody (Ab) against IL- 23 or control IgG was injected intraperitoneally. On days 1 and 8 after the final OVA exposure, airway inflammation and responsiveness to methacholine, immunoglobulin levels in serum, and cytokine release from splenocytes were evaluated. Skin Il 23 a mRNA levels were evaluated with quantitative RT-PCR. ResultsPatch application time-dependently increased the expression of Il 23 a mRNA expression in the skin. Treatment with the anti-IL- 23 Ab during <b>sensitization</b> <b>phase</b> alone significantly reduced the number of eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids and peribronchial spaces after allergen challenge compared with treatment with control IgG. Anti-IL- 23 Ab also reduced serum levels of OVA-specific IgG 1.

Habituation, sensitization, {{or a combination of}} both were elicited by varying stimulation parameters and lesion condition. Analysis of response plasticity shows that the late phase of the response is selectively enhanced by <b>sensitization,</b> whereas all <b>phases</b> are decreased by habituation. Previous data have shown that tentacle withdrawal is mediated conjointly by parallel monosynaptic and polysynaptic pathways. The former mediates the early phase, whereas the latter mediates the late phase of the response. Plastic loci were identified by stimulating and recording at different points within the neural circuit, in combination with selective lesions. Results indicate that depression occurs at an upstream locus, before circuit divergence, and is therefore expressed in all pathways, whereas facilitation requires downstream facilitatory neurons and is selectively expressed in polysynaptic pathways. Differential expression of plasticity between pathways helps explain the behavioral manifestation of depression and facilitation. A simple mathematical model is used to show how serial positioning of depression and facilitation can explain the kinetics of dual-process learning. These results illustrate how the position of cellular plasticity in the network affects behavioral change and how forms of plasticity can interact to determine the kinetics of the net changes...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{reports have}} shown that {{elevated}} polyamine biosynthesis is sufficient to promote skin tumorigenesis in susceptible mouse strains. We hypothesized that increased activity of epidermal ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), a key regulatory enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis, may suppress the cutaneous immune response in addition to stimulating proliferation. Using an ODCER transgenic mouse model in which ODC is targeted to the epidermis, we examined the effect of ODC overexpression in keratinocytes on a classic contact hypersensitivity (CHS) response. Compared with normal littermate mice, ODCER transgenic mice showed reduced ear swelling, reduced neutrophil infiltration, and decreased migration of fluorescein isothiocyanate-loaded dendritic cells (DCs) to draining lymph nodes following hapten elicitation of CHS. In addition, elevated epidermal ODC activity suppressed the levels of cytokines keratinocyte-derived chemokine, monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1, interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), and IL- 10. Adoptive transfer of lymphocytes from sensitized ODCER transgenic or normal littermate mice to naive ODCER transgenic or wild-type mice indicated that elevated epidermal ODC activity suppresses both the <b>sensitization</b> and elicitation <b>phases</b> of CHS. The specific ODC inhibitor, α-difluoromethylornithine, abrogated all suppressive effects of ODC in CHS reactions.

40|$|IL- 4 Ralpha-mediated STAT 6 {{activation}} serves {{an essential}} role in various animal models of allergy and asthma at both the <b>sensitization</b> and effector <b>phases.</b> IL- 4 and IL- 13 signaling via the IL- 4 Ralhpa chain exacerbates murine anaphylaxis, but the cell-specific requirements for IL- 4 Ralpha expression are unclear. The {{purpose of this study was}} to elucidate the mechanisms of systemic anaphylaxis to OVA in gene-targeted mice with a deletion of the IL- 4 Ralpha chain in the macrophage/neutrophil or CD 4 + T lymphocyte population. Results demonstrated that anaphylaxis in this model was entirely dependent upon the FcgammaRII/III and was associated with mast cell degranulation. Expression of the IL- 4 Ralpha on CD 4 + T cells, but not macrophages or neutrophils, was critical for severe anaphylaxis, characterized by diarrhea, hypothermia, and death. Ab depletion experiments demonstrated that IFN-gamma protected against mortality and severe intestinal pathology despite the presence of Ag and specific Ab. This protection was associated with reduced levels of mast cell protease, a marker of mast cell degranulation, suggesting that IFN-gamma may inhibit mast cell degranulation in vivo. These data suggest that it may be possible to limit the severity of anaphylaxis using rational therapies designed to increase numbers of IFN-gamma-producing cells by targeting IL- 4 Ralpha signaling in CD 4 + T lymphocytes...|$|R
40|$|Regulatory T (Treg) cells {{suppress}} {{contact hypersensitivity}} (CHS) responses, but the dynamics, mode, and site of their {{action is not}} well characterized. We studied forkhead box P 3 + (Foxp 3 +) Treg cells during the CHS response in conditional Foxp 3 knockout depletion of regulatory T cell (DEREG) mice, where Foxp 3 + cells can be transiently deleted by diphtheria toxin. The mice were sensitized and challenged with oxazolone, and Foxp 3 + cells were depleted either during sensitization or elicitation. Treg cell depletion before sensitization led to significantly exacerbated and prolonged CHS responses. In contrast, depleting Treg cells during elicitation {{had no effect on}} the 24 -hour response, but the response was significantly prolonged. In wild-type mice, the gradual resolution of the CHS response was accompanied by a similarly gradual accumulation of Foxp 3 + Treg cells relative to T effector cells in the skin. This effect was not as marked in the Treg cell–depleted mice, suggesting that the skin is an important site of Treg cell activities during the resolution phase. Together, our results show that endogenous Foxp 3 + Treg cell function is important during the <b>sensitization</b> and resolution <b>phases,</b> but their depletion just before elicitation does not {{have an effect on the}} CHS response during the first 24 hours after elicitation...|$|R
40|$|Purpose {{of review}} This review {{summarizes}} selected articles on animal models of food allergy published in 2003. The research {{areas that are}} covered include mechanistic studies, the search for new therapies, as well as screening models for hazard identification of potential allergens. Recent findings Novel treatment options of both prevention and therapeutic strategies have been reported with promising results. The induction of de-sensitization to food proteins was achieved by exposure to a mixture of recombinant food allergens and T helper 1 (Th 1) -skewing bacterial components. Furthermore, research in animal models has provided {{new insights into the}} role of protein structure, digestion, and gut permeability in sensitization and tolerance induction to food proteins. The Th 2 hypothesis of food allergy was tested in mouse strains, linking genetic susceptibility to sensitization with differential Th 1 -Th 2 responses. In this context, the role of the liver in development of food antigen-specific Th 2 cells, and the importance of costimulatory molecules in Th 2 skewing were demonstrated. Finally, rodent models to predict potential allergenicity of novel foods have been further developed using different routes of sensitization. Summary Currently, several animal models of food allergy are used, including mouse, rat, swine, and dog. Continuing research in these models may elucidate the immunological mechanisms that underlie the <b>sensitization</b> and challenge <b>phase</b> of food allergy and may result in improved therapeutic options. Furthermore, the development of animal models to predict relative allergenicity of novel foods remains an important topic...|$|R
40|$|The mixed {{lymphocyte}} culture (MLC) {{test has}} {{been regarded as}} an in vitro model of the recognition or <b>sensitization</b> <b>phase</b> of the homograft or graft-versus-host reaction. It {{has been suggested that}} the graft-versus-host response in vivo is less in xenogeneic combinations than in allogeneic ones {{and that there is a}} similar quantitative relationship in MLC responses. Given the above interpretation of the MLC test, this could suggest that the lesser reactivity in xenogeneic combinations may be due to a lesser recognition of the stimulus. We have done nine experiments testing allogeneic and xenogeneic combinations in MLC, largely in combinatorial fashion. The results indicate that the response in xenogeneic MLC may be as great as that in allogeneic MLC and that, as in different allogeneic mixtures, there is great variation in the extent to which xenogeneic mixtures may respond...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Food allergy is {{a serious}} health concern among infants and young children. Although {{immunological}} mechanism of food allergy is well documented, the molecular mechanism(s) involved in food allergen sensitization have not been well characterized. Therefore, the present study analyzed the mesenteric lymph node (MLN) transcriptome profiles of BALB/c mice in response to three common food allergens. Results Microarray analysis identified a total of 1361, 533 and 488 differentially expressed genes in response to β-lactoglobulin (BLG) from cow's milk, ovalbumin (OVA) from hen's egg white and peanut agglutinin (PNA) sensitizations, respectively (p Conclusions Immunological profiles indicate that the allergen dosages used are sufficient to sensitize the BALB/c mice and to conduct transcriptome profiling. Microarray studies identified several differentially expressed genes in the <b>sensitization</b> <b>phase</b> of the food allergy. These findings will help {{to better understand the}} underlying molecular mechanism(s) of food allergen sensitizations and may be useful in identifying the potential biomarkers of food allergy. </p...|$|E
40|$|Chemokine {{receptor}} CCR 4 {{is expressed}} by Th 2 cells and {{is involved in}} the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the skin. We studied the effects of CCR 4 deficiency in the murine model of oxazolone-induced contact hypersensitivity in CCR 4 -/- and wild-type (WT) mice. The inflammatory response in the skin at 24 hours post-elicitation was stronger in CCR 4 -/- mice compared with WT, evidenced by increased ear swelling and inflammatory cell infiltration. In addition, the mRNA expression levels of several cytokines, chemokines, chemokine receptors, and selectins in the skin of CCR 4 -/- mice were significantly elevated compared with WT mice. Time kinetic experiments during the sensitization and elicitation phases revealed that the number of CD 3 +CD 4 + cells in CCR 4 -/- mice remained high longer during the <b>sensitization</b> <b>phase</b> and increased more rapidly during the elicitation phase compared with WT mice. These data demonstrate that the absence of CCR 4 results in enhanced secondary immune response during allergic skin inflammation...|$|E
40|$|Allergic contact {{dermatitis}} (ACD) is an inflammatory skin disease of great and steadily increasing importance as an occupational health problem. The disease is induced by chemicals and metal ions which penetrate {{the skin and}} form complexes with host proteins. This process {{is accompanied by a}} strong, allergen-induced inflammatory reaction and leads to the migration of allergen-carrying dendritic cells (DC) from the skin to regional lymph nodes, where they promote generation of allergen-specific T cells. The latter are the ultimate effector cells of the disease. Re-exposure to the causative agent leads to the recruitment of the T effector cells, which then elicit the typical skin inflammatory reaction at the site of contact. Although DC and effector T cells play a protagonistic role in the <b>sensitization</b> and elicitation <b>phase</b> of ACD, respectively, other cell types including keratinocytes, NK cells, mast cells and B cells contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. In this review the authors summarize recent findings that identify stress responses and innate immune pathways triggered by contact allergens and review recent data regarding the adaptive T cell response. The new data were collected mainly from studies on contact hypersensitivity (CHS), the corresponding experimental mouse model of human ACD. The elucidation of the molecular events involved in contact allergen-induced innate responses will help to design new treatment strategies and may allow to develop predictive in vitro assays for the identification of contact allergens...|$|R
40|$|Allergy either {{results from}} a {{pathological}} excessive immune reaction, or from the defective induction of tolerance to otherwise harmless antigens. Allergic reactions are mounted by mechanisms of innate and adaptive immunity. The development of an allergic response can be divided in <b>sensitization</b> and elicitation <b>phases.</b> Immediate type allergic reactions (e. g. anaphylaxis, urticaria, rhinoconjunctivitis allergica, allergic asthma) are mediated by IgE antibodies which are produced by B cells stimulated by allergen-specific Th 2 cells. Crosslinking of allergen-specific IgE on membrane surfaces of mast cells and basophilic granulocytes leads to release of soluble mediators which may cause systemic symptoms within minutes to hours. The following infiltration of eosinophilic granulocytes and Th 2 cells directs chronic inflammation. Humoral cytotoxic immune reactions (e. g. drug induced cytopenia) are mediated by IgG and IgM antibodies which are directed against membrane associated antigens. IgG and IgM antibodies directed against soluble antigens elicit immune complex mediated cytotoxicity (e. g. drug induced vasculitis). Delayed type immune reactions (e. g. contact dermatitis) {{are based on the}} activation of antigen specific CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells and need 24 h to 48 h to develop. Upon recurrent contact with identical antigens, recruitment of CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells cause inflammation and cytotoxic induced apoptosis in target cells as well as cytokine mediated leukocyte infiltration. Subsequent immigration of CD 4 + Th 2 cells provides anti-inflammatory mechanisms leading to resolution of the inflammatory response and tissue repair...|$|R
40|$|Since Langerhans cells (LC) are the {{principal}} antigen-presenting cells among epidermal cells, treatments suppressing LC function may inhibit CHR. Although calcium channel blockers (CCB) {{have been shown to}} suppress the functions of several immunologically active cells, little is known about their effect on LC. In this study we show that pretreatment with topical 1 % nifedipine or verapamil HCl significantly suppressed both the <b>sensitization</b> and elicitation <b>phases</b> of a CHR in mice. We then investigated whether CCB affected LC. Flow cytometric analysis of regional lymph node cells obtained 24 h after applying FITC demonstrated that topical CCB treatment significantly reduced the percentage of FITC+ NLDC- 145 + cells, suggesting that CCB had suppressed antigen transport by LC. In vitro treatment with nifedipine or verapamil significantly suppressed the antigen-presenting capacity of LC in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, in vitro CCB treatment reduced the percentage of class II MHC antigen-positive epidermal cells and significantly suppressed class II MHC and B 7 - 1 levels in LC, as determined by flow cytometry and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, whereas surface expression of B 7 - 2 and mRNA was only weakly reduced. Neither expression of CD 45 nor the percentage of CD 45 + cells were affected, suggesting that the effects of CCB on LC were not due to cytotoxicity. Our results suggest that CCB inhibit CHR, at least in part, by suppressing the functions of LC...|$|R
