The <b>stop</b> <b>face</b> and the backup face are those surfaces which engage when the axial load on the impeller exceeds the load balancing capability. The plugs have a truncated conical configuration so as to be trapped in the backup face, and are placed at varying radii on the face to provide complete surface lubrication.

Connection between the anvil and the blade is by means of a pair of vertical shafts held in substantially friction free engagement by two pairs of adjustable linear bearings.

The purpose is the development of methods of predicting the manifestations of rock pressure and the advancement of the process of winning the coal reserves from under the pillars and end portions of the seams in the conditions of soft enclosing rock deposits. The dependences defining the manifestations of the rock pressure in the <b>stoping</b> <b>faces</b> while underworking the pillars and end portions of the seams in the mines of the Chelyabinsk field have been established.

The current phenotyping possibilities are discussed...|$|R
