60|$|The {{fishermen}} {{also helped}} him not a little, by giving him many rare kinds of fish or refuse from their nets, which he duly examined and classified. As a rule, the hardy men who {{go on the}} smacks have a profound contempt for natural history, {{and will not be}} tempted, even by offers of money, to assist those whom they consider as half-daft gentlefolk in what seems to them a perfectly useless and almost childish amusement. But it was different with Tam Edward, the strange shoemaker whom they all knew so well; if HE wanted fish or rubbish for his neat collection in the home-made glass cases, why, of course he could have them, and welcome. So they brought him rare sand-suckers, and blue-striped wrasse, and <b>saury</b> <b>pike,</b> and gigantic cuttle-fish, four feet long, to his heart's content. Edward's daughters were now also old enough to help him in his scientific studies. They used to watch for the clearing of the nets, and pick out of the refuse whatever they thought would interest or please their father. But the fish themselves were Edward's greatest helpers and assistants. As Dr. Smiles quaintly puts it, they were {{the best of all possible}} dredgers. His daughters used to secure him as many stomachs as possible, and from their contents he picked out an immense number of beautiful and valuable specimens. The bill of fare of the cod alone comprised an incredible variety of small crabs, shells, shrimps, sea-mice, star-fish, jelly-fish, sea anemones, eggs, and zoophytes. All these went to swell Edward's new collection of marine animals.|$|E
40|$|Author abstract]Trials of rearing young {{bluefin tuna}} and bonito in a wire netting cage were made. The {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} at Oshima near Kushimoto, Wakayama Prefecture. The fish experimented with were captured {{by a kind of}} trap net set near the coasts of Oshima and Tsuyashima Islands. Forty-two young fish of bluefin tuna captured on August 26 to October 5, 1972, were soon transferred to a round wire netting cage provisionally set near the west coast of Oshima Island. The cage is 8 m in diameter and about 6 m in depth. The fish were fed with such fishes as anchovy, mackerel, sand eel and <b>saury</b> <b>pike.</b> The fish captured on August 28 to September 2 were 33. 4 - 41. 0 cm in total length and weighed 500 - 890 g, but grew to about 60 cm and 3500 g on January 31 next year. The survival rate of these fish was 35. 7 percent on January 31, 1973, five months after they were fished. Thirty-three young fish of bonito captured on August 31 to October 1, 1972, were soon transferred to the same wire netting cage together with bluefin tuna and were fed with the same baits as for bluefin tuna. The fish captured on September 29 to October 2 were about 40 cm in total length and weighed 675 g, but were found to be about 50 cm and 1, 500 g on January 31 next year. The survival rate of these fish was 54. 5 percent on January 1, 1973, four months after they were fished. The growth and survival rates of young bluefin tuna and bonito were higher in the wire netting cage than in the fiber netting cage.
