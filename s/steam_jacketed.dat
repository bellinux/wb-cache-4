50|$|At the 1862 International Exhibition Humphrys, Tennant and Dykes showed {{details of}} the 4-cylinder {{expansion}} engines for the Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation Company's ship Mooltan. The cylinders were <b>steam</b> <b>jacketed</b> and arranged in pairs using the Woolf compound system, with the smaller (43 inch diameter) cylinder being above the larger one (of 96 inch diameter). The 4 cylinders drove a single screw propellor 16 feet in diameter. The same type of engine was also fitted to the Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation ship SS Carnatic, on which it had recorded 2442 indicated horsepower. Even though these engines were operated with only 20-25 psi steam pressure, the compound system was claimed to give significant benefits in economy.|$|E
50|$|In 1908, Edison {{introduced}} Amberol Records {{which had}} a playing time of just over 4 minutes. The process of making the finished record {{was the same as}} the Gold Molded records, however a harder wax compound was used. In 1912, celluloid was used in place of wax, and the name was changed to Blue Amberol, as the dye was a blue color. The master was recorded and then the process of making the mold was the same as the Gold Molded process. What is different is that a <b>steam</b> <b>jacketed</b> mold with an air bladder in the center was used. Celluloid tubing was put in the mold and the end gate was closed. The rubber bladder expanded the celluloid {{to the side of the}} heated mold, and printed the negative record in positive on the celluloid. The bladder was then deflated, and cold air was used to shrink the tubing so the celluloid print could be removed. The printed tubing was put in a plaster filler. When the plaster was hard the cylinders were then baked in an oven, then the ribs made on the inside of the plaster with knives. The records were cleaned and then packaged.|$|E
5000|$|In {{both cases}} {{solution}} {{is affected by}} means of pressure steam in the jacketed portion of the kettle. When the solution is substantially clear it is slowly added, a pail at a time (3 gallons) {{by means of a}} 2 quart dipper, to the heated stearic acid as prepared in 1. The oil burner is kept on during this operation {{in order to keep the}} temperature of the mixture fairly constant at 360 degrees F. Care must be exercised in adding this [...] "Saponifying" [...] solution so that excess foaming is prevented. After all the solution has been added the resulting [...] "formula wax" [...] is heated to 400 degrees F. and maintained at this temperature for four hours, at which time a sample is removed, a congealing point determined, (see under [...] "tests"), and any addition made of stearic acid or sodium carbonate solution for correction, and the mixture held without additional heat for 10 hours. It is then heated again to bring the temperature up to 400 degrees F and allowed to cool gradually, usually overnight. When the temperature has again been reduced to 350 degrees F the wax is pumped by means of a Kinney pump into 10 gallon pails from which the wax is poured into shallow pans containing approximately 50 lbs of the wax per pan. After the material has cooled to room temperature it is removed from the pans and stacked. [...] 3. Into a 200-gallon cast iron cauldron heated by and oil burner of the household type, (or as required at present by war conditions, heated by bituminous coal) are placed 500 to 900 labs of [...] "formula wax". Note: The amount of [...] "formula wax" [...] to make up a batch various according to the amount of scrap wax which is to be added to the cauldron. Scrap wax represents commercial wax of which [...] "formula wax" [...] is a part. To the amount of [...] "formula wax placed in the cauldron are added 19½% Paraffin (133 degrees-135 degrees F., usual source Standard Oil of New Jersey) and 2% stearine pitch (M. P. 40 Degrees Centigrade). This mixture, consisting of [...] "formula wax", paraffin and stearine pitch, represents commercial wax. Finally, commercial scrap wax of the composition given above in added until the total weight of the mixture is approximately 1,600 lbs. This mixture is usually heated beginning at 12 midnight and carried through until the temperature is 410-415 degrees F. at 8 a.m. Note; This may be regarded as standard procedure, although at the present time (Dec., 1943) this has been modified so that only Sunday nights is this done. On other days of the week except Saturday the kettles are started at 6 A.M. This method was adopted due to man shortages which necessitated starting the molding operation later in the day.) At this time a congealing point is taken and the necessary adjustments made (see under [...] "tests") after which the mixture is transferred to a closed agitating tank by means of a Kinney pump, the latter forced the hot material through a 2" [...] pipe. [...] 4. To the mixture in the agitation tank there is added 3/10 percent Johns-Manville # 503 Filter Aid. The temperature is maintained at 375 degrees F. by means of a ring gas burner, at the bottom of the tank. At this temperature the wax is supplied by a Worthington pump at 30 lbs to a one square foot Shriver press whose head and follower are <b>steam</b> <b>jacketed</b> and which has 7 sections. The effluent from this press passes through a second Shriver press which has 2 sections of one square foot each. The mixture from the outlet here finally passes though a 1" [...] pipe which has a 100 × 150 mesh Monel, metal screen held in its cross sections by means of a union, into one of four 75 gallon aluminum kettles[...] These kettles are protected by conical hoods to prevent dust particles being carried into the body of the wax. After allowing the wax to remain at 330 degrees F. for three hours it is ready to be poured into the blank moulds. The temperature is maintained by gas burners beneath the kettles and controlled automatically by Partlow Corp. thermostatic controls. [...] 5. By means of a pot with 2 spouts the moulds are filled with molten wax. The pot has a capacity of about five pounds (slightly less than 2 quarts and is specially designed of aluminum and made by Theodore Walter, Newark N.J... The molding table revolves at the rate of 6 blanks per minute, approximately, and the size of the pouring pot spout is only sufficient to permit the hot wax to flow into the molds at a rate slightly faster than the speed of the molds which rotate past a given point around the table. [...] The blanks are extracted at a temperature of 200-205 degrees F. and place on boards which hold 30 blanks. These boards when filled move by gravity down a conveyor. The length of time on the conveyor is about two hours after which time they are sufficiently cool and hard to be put into production boxes holding 63 blanks. The boxes are placed in racks for the following day's production. Into each production box there is placed a semi-finished cylinder, which has been edged and reamed and which conforms to a standard internal diameter at 70 degrees F of 1.826 [...] " [...] at the thin end. The purpose of this is to permit the edging operation to take place on the un-finished blank at any temperature by adjusting the machine to conform to the standard. Thus, in each production box, there is a total of 63 unfinished cylinders. One day's production is held at least 34 hours before further processing. 6. The blanks are first reamed. The reamer consists of a twisted tapered and eight fluted tool. The blanks are forced on the reamer by hand to a stop. The position of the stop is adjusted so that sufficient material will be removed from both ends of the blanks when the blank is edged in the next operation. The reamer revolves at approximately 300 RPM. 7. The edging operation consists in placing a reamed blank on a tapered mandrel and by means of two special cutters working in unison the ends of the blank are formed to conform in couture to a standard template. A second gauge is used to insure proper length (6⅛"). IN each case the edged blank must rest on a tapered mandrel gauge in exactly the same position as the standard blank which is in the production box. The usual procedure is to make the necessary adjustments of the knives of the first blank which is edged so that is conforms to the standard, and then continue the operation on the rest of the blanks in the production box at the identical position of the first blank. Note; since there are 63 blanks for each standard blank it will be observed that every 63rd cylinder is checked mandrel gauge. The accuracy of the method and the facility with which it is done depend on the care and skill of the operator. This is the most critical of all the operations. The edging machine revolves at 2,200 RPM. 8. Following the edging operation is the stamping. This consists in applying a hot printing die to the thick end of the cylinder as it is placed accurately in a vertical position under the die. The heating of the die is done by means of a resistance wire coiled within a hollow torus near the under edge of the circular die. The coiled wire is connected to a source of current and the latter is adjusted by means of a rheostat. The heated died has raised lettering and makes and impression on the end surface of the wax cylinder. The depressed positive lettering on the cylinder is filled with a thick paste of zinc carbonate, the excess of which is brushed or wiped off after drying. [...] 9. The cylinders are next shaved on a ganged shaving machine consisting of a rough shaving knife free from [...] "blinds" [...] and [...] "lines", accurate concentricity and a minimum of taper. These factors depend on the tension of the driving belt, tension upon the rotating mandrel between centers and the position and sharpness of the knives. The speed of the mandrel is around 2,200 RPM. 10. The finished cylinders are placed in boxes which contain 16 pegs and run down a conveyor. At a point on this conveyor the cylinders are held and brushed on the inside to remove wax shavings and dust. [...] 11. Cylinders are inspected, packed and placed in the stock room for a minimum of thirty days before shipping. [...] 12. The reinforcing liners are made as follows: Crinoline cloth of specifications given under [...] "Tests", are cut into a trapezoid (Paper Products Dept.) base length 6¼, altitude 5⅝" [...] top length 5¾". A pack of these are placed in a vise edgewise and thinned glue, one part Le Pages Glue, one part water, brushed onto one slant edge. A liner is then wrapped a tapered mandrel of such size as to fit no too snugly on the molding core. The liner is held on the mandrel by means of two jaws actuated by a foot lever and the lapped edges of the liner glued by means of a gas iron held for an instant along the line of the lap. J.W.

40|$|The thermal death {{curve of}} dried spores of Bacillus stearothermophilus in {{saturated}} steam {{was characterized by}} three phases: (i) a sharp initial rise in viable count; (ii) a low rate of death which gradually increased; and (iii) logarithmic death at maximal rate. The first phase was a reflection of inadequate heat activation of the spore population. The second and third phases represented the characteristic thermal death curve of the spores in saturated <b>steam.</b> A <b>jacketed</b> <b>steam</b> sterilizer, equipped with a system for initial evacuation of the chamber, was examined for superheat during normal operation. Measurements of spore inactivation and temperature revealed superheat in surface layers of fabrics being processed in steam at 121 C. The high temperature of the fabric surfaces was attributed to absorption of excess heat energy from superheated steam. The superheated steam was produced {{at the beginning of}} the normal sterilizing cycle by transfer of heat from the steam-heated jacket to saturated steam entering the vessel...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to find an optimal process for a manually operated <b>jacketed</b> <b>steam</b> steriliser, which is mainly used in developing countries. The experiments were focussed on the steam penetration into a textile test pack and the drying procedure. The performance of the various test cycles was evaluated against the requirements in the European standards for large steam sterilisers and the validation of steam sterilisers, by measuring the temperature and pressure in the steriliser and textile test packs. The standard sterilisation process as recommended by the manufacturer of the steam steriliser did not fulfil the requirements by far and could not be considered as a proper sterilisation process. The optimum process for sterilisation of a worst case load (textile in top and bottom perforated sterilisation drums) was found to be: 20 minutes steam flushing at atmospheric pressure, three times a slow pressure build-up to 300 kPa followed by a drop to 100 kPa and finally a slow pressure build-up to the sterilisation pressure. This process has however not been proven suitable for the sterilisation of hollow medical devices. The optimum drying result was obtained by the use of an external condensation vessel. The condensation vessel also contributed to cost effective operation by it's simple design and low water consumption...|$|R
40|$|Crude {{palm oil}} (CPO) has high {{tendency}} to solidify. This drawback has make the CPO become solidify in the pipelines and will cause loss {{of millions of}} ringgit per year. The objectives of this research were to identify suitable temperature condition for best flow performance of CPO (least frictional force exists) and to identify physical parameter to create resonance frequency using ultrasonic equipment. There are two methods that were employed {{for the improvement of}} the CPO in transportation handling which are by using <b>jacketed</b> <b>steam</b> and ultrasonic equipment. This work reports viscosity data, determined with viscometer for CPO over the temperature range of 30 ºC - 60 ºC and also the viscosity data that was determined for CPO over the ultrasonic frequency of 3 MHz, 6 MHz and 9 MHz. From the result obtained, the viscosity of the CPO decreases nonlinearly with increasing temperature as has been found in other ordinary liquids. Then, all solid CPO were observed to be totally dissolved at temperature 50 ºC. By using ultrasonic equipment, the result shows that viscosity decreases approximately linearly with increasing ultrasonic frequency at constant temperature. All the methods used shows satisfactory results, where the flow of the CPO in transportation handling will increase. The research findings shall ease problems to CPO transporter or pipeline users and it would contribute significantly in cost reduction of CPO storage and handling. ...|$|R

40|$|When DOE {{funds were}} {{exhausted}} in March 1995, all Phase 2 activities {{were placed on}} hold. In February 1996 a detailed cost estimate was submitted to the DOE for completing the two remaining Phase 2 Multi Annular Swirl Burner (MASB) topping combustor test burns; in August 1996 release was received from METC to proceed with these tests. The first test (Test Campaign No. 3) will be conducted to: (1) test the MASB at proposed demonstration plant full to minimum loading operating conditions; (2) identify the lower oxygen limit of the MASB; and (3) demonstrate natural gas to carbonizer fuel gas switching. The Livingston Phase 3 Pilot Plant was last operated under contract DE-AC 21 - 86 MC 21023 in September 1995 for seven days in an integrated carbonizer-CPFBC configuration. In May, 1996, the pilot plant was transferred to Contract DE-AC 22 - 95 PC 95143 to allow testing {{in support of the}} High Performance Power Systems (HIPPS) Program. The HIPPS Program required modifications to the pilot plant and the following changes were incorporated: (1) installation of a dense phase transport system for loading pulverized coal into the feed system lock hopper directly from a pneumatic transport truck; (2) removal of the char transfer pipe between the char collecting hopper and the CPFBC to allow carbonizer only operation; (3) installation of a lock hopper directly under the char collecting hopper to facilitate char removal from the process, the hopper vent gases exhaust to the carbonizer baghouse filter and the depressured char is transferred via nitrogen to the CPFBC baghouse for dumping into drums; (4) removal of the carbonizer cyclone and top of bed overflow drain line; all material elutriated from the carbonizer bed will thus be removed by the 22 -element Westinghouse ceramic candle filter; (5) replacement of the carbonizer continuous bottom bed drain (screw feeder) with a batch-type drain removal system; and (6) installation of a mass spectrometer that draws sample gas via a <b>steam</b> <b>jacketed</b> line from the refractory lined piping downstream of the candle filter...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to detect the {{bacterial}} load and types of bacteria in rendered slaughter by-products used as poultry feed. Two by-products processors using two types of raw materials (poultry and ruminants slaughter by-products) and different levels of sanitation were included in this study. Both processors employed the dry-rendering system for treatment using horizontal <b>steam</b> <b>jacketed</b> apparatuses (cookers). Fifty four samples were taken {{at different stages of}} processing, before cooking (Ground), after cooking (Cooked) and after milling and packing (Packed meals) and used to : 1 -Determine the load and type of bacteria in unprocessed slaughter by-prod ucts. 2 -Determine the load and type of bacteria in slaughter by-products at various stages of processing. 3 -Determine the efficiency of treatment procedures in reducing the bacterial load and recommend the best methods to guarantee the microbiological safety of processed slaughter by-products. An average aerobic plate count of 11 x 107 CFU/gm. was obtained for ground poultry by-products whereas the average coliform count was 1. 9 x 106 CFU/ gm. After treatment at 116 C for 3 hrs the aerobic plate count and coliform count declined to Zero in cooked samples, but recontamination occurred after milling and packing to increase the count to 7. 4 x 106 CFU/ gm [...] xviii An average aerobic plate count of 5. 0 x 107 CFU/gm. was obtained for ground ruminants by-products before treatment and an average coliform count of 3. 4 x 106 CFU/gm.. After treatment at 230 C for 4 hrs the count was reduced to 1. 4 x 103 CFU/gm. and coliform count declined to Zero, but after packing the average count increased to 5. 5 x 105 CFU/gm and the coliform count was 1. 6 x 106 CFU/gm. This increase in bacterial viable count in packed meal is unacceptable in poultry additives. A total of 196 bacterial isolates were obtained and which were characteri-zed according to their morphology, Gram stain reaction, and biochemical reaction. Isolates included Escherichia coli, Sallmonella spp., Klebsiella spp, Proteus spp., Yersinina spp., Listeria spp., Pseudomonas spp., Staphyloco- ccus spp.,Streptococcus spp.,Bacillus spp., Corynebacterium spp. and aerotolerant Clostridium. The high contamination rate and presence of potential pathogens in unprocessed samples constituted high risks for humans and the environment. The efficiency of the cookers was measured by examining the cooked sam-ples. The detection of aero-tolerant Clostridium tertium and Bacillus mace-rans in cooked ruminants by-products indicated the inefficiency of the procedure employed. Collection of by-products from clean sources and increasing the holding time or repeat cooking will improve the bacterial quality of ruminants slaughter by-products meals. Packed ruminants meal showed contamination by organisms usually found in raw materials such as E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Streptococcus spp. Cory-nebacterium spp. and Bacillus spp., and xix this suggests possible recontamin-tion from raw material during air drying either by direct contact or indirectly by insects and rodents. Poultry feed additives are usually stored for a considerable time in the factory or poultry farms and this permits the multiplication of contaminating bacteria. Therefore re-sterilization of these additives is recommended before they are mixed in poultry feed...|$|E
40|$|In {{an effort}} to improve the environment, {{there is a need}} to recover and reuse the oil and water {{components}} of lubricating emulsions used in copper drawing and rolling processes. The Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc. copper rod mill located in El Paso, TX was chosen as the site location for this project. It is one of the largest rolling and drawing operation facilities in the world, and it meets the established criteria set by Project ORDER. A large facility generates an average of 8, 400 gallons of spent lubricant per day. The WERC emulsion sample contains 98 v% water and 2 v% lubricating oil and contains metal debris that would negatively impact water quality if it were discharged into surface waters. Oil and water are valuable resources and their maximum recoveries are desired. Project ORDER successfully recovers more than 90 v% of the water and essentially all of the oil. The recovered water could be recycled for fresh lubricant production within the facility, eliminating almost all water discharge and reducing water intake. The recovered oil will be sent to oil recyclers, lowering discharge expenses. Project ORDER has carefully evaluated several water recovery, oil recovery, and metal recovery technologies to design the commercial process. The first processing step of Project ORDER is an ultrafiltration (UF) membrane that recovers 90 v% of the water in the spent emulsion sample. As water permeates the membrane, the concentration of oil in the emulsion increases from about 2 v% to 30 v%. The second processing step removes essentially all of the water from the UF concentrate using an evaporator, which operates by passing low pressure <b>steam</b> through a <b>jacketed,</b> agitated vessel. The third processing step removes metal debris from the oil using a depth filter. The fourth processing step utilizes a reverse osmosis (RO) membrane to purify the UF permeate water for recycle. The fifth processing step reduces the amount of waste from the RO reject using an evaporator, which also operates by passing low pressure <b>steam</b> through a <b>jacketed,</b> agitated vessel. The evaporator removes essentially all of the water in the RO reject and the remaining waste is sent for disposal. The evaporated water from both evaporation units is condensed and combined with the RO permeate to be recycled. Based on a spent emulsion production rate of 8, 400 gal/day, it costs $ 793, 000 per year for current disposal by incineration. For Project ORDER the fixed capital investment is $ 899, 000, the yearly operating cost is $ 528, 000, and the net present worth is $ 413, 000 with a 24 % discounted rate of return. After the initial investment is recovered, Project ORDER results in a net savings of $ 265, 000 per year. This project is a promising process to achieve all the goals of Task 5. It produces oil with less than 3 % water content, produces maximum water yield, minimizes waste solution, avoids the use of harmful materials and is cost and energy efficient. The health and safety of all individuals involved and the environmental impact of Project ORDER is of utmost importance throughout the construction and life of the project. The facility will ensure that all processes will comply with regulations outlined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), and Texas State and El Paso County regulations. All operations and company procedures will comply with The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986. The following report provides a detailed proposal for an oil and water recovery system, including experimental research results, process optimization, full-scale design, economic analysis, and environmental, health and safety considerations...|$|R
