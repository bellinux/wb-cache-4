In order to design the <b>shearing</b> <b>pattern</b> for the eco-friendly stud, the finite element analysis and Taguchi method are employed. For the design of expanding process of <b>sheared</b> <b>patterns,</b> the whole roll-forming processes are simulated by finite element method. Six geometries are considered to see the durability and fire resistance of the dry wall, for which structural and thermal analyses are performed. For determining the best, the orthogonal array and smaller-the-better characteristics of the Taguchi method are utilized. As the roll gap of the upper-and-lower roll type causes flange buckling, the side roll type is adopted. The stress and strain distributions {{as well as the}} formed shape obtained from the finite element simulation are used for the successful design of the roll-forming processes. The material cost of the eco-friendly stud can be reduced, compared to the conventional stud. Moreover, the expanding process by side rolls shortens the length of the roll-forming process and minimizes the die cost.

Separate sets of <b>shearing</b> <b>patterns</b> are constructed for the four standard processing routes: route A with no rotation of the sample between consecutive passes, routes BA and BC with rotations of 90 ° in alternate directions or the same direction between each pass, and route C with a rotation of 180 ° between passes. It is concluded {{that the development of}} a uniform microstructure of equiaxed grains, separated by high-angle grain boundaries, is favored using route BC because (i) shearing occurs over large angular ranges on the three orthogonal planes within the sample, (ii) there is a regular and periodic restoration of an equiaxed structure during consecutive pressings and (iii) deformation occurs on each orthogonal plane...|$|R

40|$|The Tremaine-Weinberg {{equations}} are solved for {{a pattern}} speed that {{is allowed to}} vary with radius. The solution method transforms an integral equation for the pattern speed to a least squares problem with well established procedures for statistical analysis. The method applied to the HI spiral pattern of the barred, grand-design galaxy NGC 1365 produced convincing evidence for a radial dependence in the pattern speed. The pattern speed behaves approximately as 1 /r, and {{is very similar to}} the material speed. There are no clear indications of corotation or Lindblad resonances. Tests show that the results are not selection biased, and that the method is not measuring the material speed. Other methods of solving the Tremaine-Weinberg equations for <b>shearing</b> <b>patterns</b> were found to produce results in agreement with those obtained using the current method. Previous estimates that relied on the assumptions of the density-wave interpretation of spiral structure are inconsistent with the results obtained using the current method.

40|$|Concentration {{polarisation}} and fouling reduce {{performance as}} well as increase costs. In order to mitigate these effects, understanding the cause and effects of these phenomena is crucial. It has been hypothesized, and {{to a certain extent}} shown, that amelioration of fouling can be achieved through the use of time varying shear for example use of air-sparging or sharp changes in crossflow velocity. Nevertheless the effect of shear on membrane fouling, in particular its effect on the foulant deposition and the transmission of small molecules in microfiltration, is not well understood. The goal of this project was to achieve an understanding of various foulant be- haviour. The work was divided into two parts. Firstly, the observations of fouling by freshwater algae, Chlorella Sorokiniana, were carried out at Nanyang Technolo- gical University, Singapore. Observations using macroscopic parameters were ex- amined with an optical non-invasive observation technique called Direct Observa- tion Through Membrane (DOTM). The result yielded a novel relationship between operating flux, crossflow velocity and transmission of extracellular polysaccharide. Interestingly shear was shown to have positive {{as well as}} negative effects on fouling of microfiltration membrane. The analysis of permeate has clearly shown that a maximisation of shear rate was not ideal. The second part was concerned with observations of the effect of <b>shear</b> <b>patterns</b> on membrane fouling using newly fabricated special membrane filtration cell, Direct Shear Stress Test Cell (DSSTC), designed to fit an Anton Paar rheometer and op- erate at constant flux. Unlike the-constant-shear-filtration cells, one could impose a very wide variety of shear regimes including intermittent sharp changes of direction and sinusoidal oscillations in the DSSTC. The effect of <b>shear</b> <b>patterns</b> on transmis- sion and fouling of a model polysaccharide (Dextran Blue) through microfiltration membranes was carried out at various conditions. Again, the results showed that the maximisation of shear rate was not ideal. The effect of <b>shear</b> <b>patterns</b> and EPS on fouling by yeast suspension was also studied using the DSSTC. The benefit of oscillatory shear is foulant dependent. For example, square wave oscillatory shear led to lower relative fouling for yeast EPS, but it resulted in higher relative fouling for unwashed yeast.

40|$|Purpose: Restenosis due to distal anastomotic intimal hyperplasia, {{a leading}} cause of {{arterial}} bypass graft failure, is thought to be promoted by hemodynamic e#ects, specifically `abnormal' wall <b>shear</b> stress <b>patterns.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to quantify the e#ects of flow waveform on peri-anastomotic flow and wall <b>shear</b> stress <b>patterns.</b> Methods: Blood flow and wall <b>shear</b> stress <b>patterns</b> were numerically computed in a representative three-dimensional anastomosis using femoral, iliac and coronary flow waveforms suitable for humans at rest. Numerical results were validated against experimental data. Results: Peri-anastomotic wall <b>shear</b> stress <b>patterns</b> were influenced by a complex interplay between secondary flow e#ects and unsteadiness. Peripheral flow waveforms (iliac, femoral) produced large temporal and spatial wall shear stress gradients on the host artery bed. In comparison, the coronary flow waveform produced normalized bed wall shear stress gradients that were a factor of 2 [...] - 3 less than for the peripheral waveforms, even though average bed wall shear stress magnitudes were similar for the two waveforms. Conclusions: If anastomotic intimal hyperplasia is promoted by large spatial and/or temporal gradients of wall shear stress, as has been proposed, this study predicts that there will be markedly less intimal hyperplasia on the host artery bed of coronary bypass grafts than for peripheral bypass grafts. This information, in conjunction with a comparative histopathologic study of intimal hyperplasia distribution, could help determine specific wall shear stress factors promoting intimal hyperplasia. # 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|We {{construct}} a linear filter optimised for detecting dark-matter halos in weak-lensing data. The filter assumes a mean radial {{profile of the}} halo <b>shear</b> <b>pattern</b> and modifies that shape by the noise power spectrum. Aiming at separating dark-matter halos from spurious peaks caused by large-scale structure lensing, we model the noise as being composed of weak lensing by large-scale structures and Poisson noise from random galaxy positions and intrinsic ellipticities. Optimal filtering against the noise requires the optimal filter scale to be smaller than typical halo sizes. Although a perfect separation of halos from spurious large-scale structure peaks is strictly impossible, we use numerical simulations to demonstrate that our filter produces substantially more sensitive, reliable and stable results than the conventionally used aperture-mass statistic.
