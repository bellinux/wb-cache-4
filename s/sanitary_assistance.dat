The durable development can not be realized without the support of the civil society. In order to realize a durable development, the economical development must be combined with the geographical one, with the measure to protect the environment and of saving the resources. For the durable development of the Romanian rural space (and not only) it is necessary to pay a higher attention to the infrastructural component. The infrastructure is the material support of all activities, reflected in volume, structure, dynamic and quality of the component elements, the degree of comfort and material and spiritual civilization of the communities, their life level. The study analyzes aspects concerning the infrastructure of the Romanian rural space, of its two components: physical structure (the living space, communication means, and municipal networks) and the social structure (rural education, public health, <b>sanitary</b> – veterinary <b>assistance).</b> The analysis is realized in the Region V on its whole, from where are extracted and analyzed the data for Timis county.

5000|$|Pro-Emancipation Movement of Chilean Women or MEMCh {{was created}} on 28 May 1935 {{by a group}} of mostly working class women, many of whom were members of or sympathizers with the Chilean Communist Party; however, their goal was to have broad {{membership}} representing all aspects of the nation. It was the first women's group formed in Chile with specific political goals and an organizational strategy to become a national organization, rather than a local club. The journal, [...] (La Mujer Nueva) was created by the organization as a means of publishing their views on feminist issues. Its leadership was composed of some of Chile's pioneering feminists and include Elena Caffarena, Graciela Mandujano, Olga Poblete, and Marta Vergara, among others. Its first General Secretary and founder was Caffrena, who served in that capacity from 1935 to 1941. The organization was considered radical for its era, in that the women wanted full emancipation of their economic, civic and political spheres, recognizing that to attain those goals, radical changes must occur in all structures of society. Because the organization was heavily joined by working class women, they stressed the importance of equal pay and elimination of segregation which barred women's participation in certain jobs based on marital or other status. Related concerns were state-sponsored child care and maternity benefits, as well as the right of women to choose whether they would become mothers. Support for contraception and regulation of clandestine abortions, since therapeutic abortion was already legal, caused some parts of society to accuse MEMCh members of wanting to destroy the traditions of family. In memchistas (MEMCh members) view, they saw controlling one's biology as a part of women's family rights, including child support, inheritance, legitimacy, pension rights and others. While they strove for women's suffrage, attaining the vote was only one step toward increasing women's participation in the public sphere. MEMCh members focused their efforts on women's issues throughout the social spectrum including the families of the urban poor, middle classes and educated elites. Social issues MEMCh supported were the availability of <b>sanitary,</b> affordable housing; <b>assistance</b> for alcoholism; reform of women's prisons; and equal access to education.|$|R

Para analizar las estructuras e identificar los elementos comunes que atraviesan estos estudios, consideramos la clasificación de saberes del docente de Braslavsky y Birgin (sustantivo, pedagógico e institucional). Los resultados obtenidos nos han permitido acceder a información importante acerca de los significados compartidos por este grupo profesional. Así, la similitud entre las estructuras de los distintos grupos nos muestra que existe una representación que permite describir lo que son y lo que hacen los docentes, correspondiéndose con los postulados educativos tradicionales, marcando las diferencias con otros grupos y otras actividades profesionales. Las categorías que se presentan de modo constante, más allá de las temáticas planteadas en cada caso particular, se vinculan con el hecho de “educar”, es decir, formar sujetos escolarizados para el mundo social en el cual se está inserto. De esta manera, podemos pensar que aunque las demandas sociales ejercen una fuerte presión sobre los docentes e intentan desviarlos en su desempeño profesional hacia otras funciones (asistenciales, sanitarias o de contención social), éstas no constituyen la esencia de la función social que ellos se auto-atribuyen y pretenden conservar a lo largo del tiempo. Abstract: This article {{presents}} a comparative analysis of three studies made with teachers from different educational {{levels in the}} province of San Juan (Argentina), in which we identified the structure of their social representations - through techniques of evocation and hierarchical organization of terms – about different aspects related to the teaching and learning of Natural Sciences. To analyze the structures and identify the common elements that cut across these studies and present certain stability, we considered the classification of teacher‟s knowledge offered by Braslavsky and Birgin (substantive, pedagogic and institutional). The obtained results have allowed us to have access to important information about the meanings shared by this professional group. Thus, the similarity between the structures of the different groups shows that there exists a representation that allows us to describe what these teachers are and what they do, which correspond to traditional education approaches, marking the differences with other groups and other professional activities. The categories that appear in a constant way, beyond the topics proposed in every particular case, are related to the fact of "educating", that is, developing schooled subjects for the social world in which they live. Consequently, it can be inferred that the social demands puts strong pressure on the teachers and seem to turn their attention to other functions (supportive, <b>sanitary,</b> of social <b>assistance)</b> away from their professional performance and which do not constitute the essence of the social function they attribute to themselves and which they aim at retaining over time...|$|R

The results were validated by a triangulation process. Women identified <b>sanitary</b> <b>assistance</b> with those given when there exist physical injuries. However, if we keep questioning about it, they do express to look for something else from the professionals who attended them, although they are not able to say it before them. Somatizations that ill-treatment produces are treated by sanitary professionals without attending to the cause that caused them, and, when it is identified ill-treatment as the cause, rarely sanitary professionals send them to psychologies or psychiatrics. However, this is not identified as a bad practice, because women establish a very defined and rigid function for each professional, where, as they understand, Primary Care doctor will not be required to worry about psychic health and wellbeing of people who attend to their offices. We think, therefore, that it would be recommended that Madrid Community should create a specific health program to attend these women in order to guarantee, this way, a proper attention to people who may be in this situation as well as a minimum quality on the attention they received...|$|E

40|$|The key {{focus of}} this paper is on the link between the {{development}} of global health policies and the management of social stigma about the infector. The specific battlefield to deal with this topic is the policy modeling and policymaking of the migration flows and the labeling of the foreigner and stranger as a potential infector. In this labeling process, common sense stigma mixes pop scientific beliefs and ideological biases. This mixture can generate social risk at a higher level than health risk. That is why it is strategic to design viable strategies to prevent that health policies can be turned into no science-based politics. Health policymakers, in the current global scenarios, are tackling transnational and supranational problems, which go beyond the area of competence of national— even less local—traditional health authorities. Furthermore, those phenomena show two general features that make difficult any activity of comprehension and decision-making: on one hand, any reliable information is missing; on the other hand, those data belong to very diverse domains, so that their interpretation requires many different cultural backgrounds. Typical example is the health policies linked to global migration flows, especially those that, in the very last years, have been taking place in the Mediterranean context both from East and from South. There is general agreement on the fact the main problem related to the management of this refugee and migrant flows is the lack of a central authority, {{who is in charge of}} any crisis no matter where it takes place. In fact, national authorities manage those emergencies according to protocols that significantly differ country by country; because of the high mobility of these flows, granting an equal and fair <b>sanitary</b> <b>assistance</b> for all involved migrants turns often unfeasible, in spite of the big funds established for migrant assistance. This work aims to provide a systemic approach to the study of migration phenomena, which can take into account, at the same time, the emergence issues on any flow, as well as the strategic issues related to permanent settlements of alien communities in the hosting lands...|$|E

40|$|Settled areas {{close to}} combat zones have been {{affected}} by each stage of the war. The Gallipoli which is a frontier town took the all the burden of the war in terms of the front of Dardanelles because it is very close to the front and therefore it has been experienced many dark days together with its residents. In this tentative study, it has been generally tried to explain what happened in Gallipoli as a bird’s eye while the war continued around the town. We have also tried to mention about the activities of logistics support units, transitions from the units, health services and hospitals, and the sacrifices of the heroic Turkish commanders, soldiers and the public. The 3 rd Army Corps located in Tekirdag {{at the beginning of the}} enemy bombardment was taken to Gallipoli later on and assigned with the zone defense of the Dardanelles against the possible landings. Headquarters was located in Gallipoli. General Esat Pasha was the commander of headquarters. 5 th and 7 th Divisions were also located in the part of Gallipoli isthmus/ narrow passage. Marshal Liman von Sanders was appointed as the Commander of the 5 th Army and the French Consulate building in Gallipoli was allocated as the headquarters and authority. The Marshal came to Gallipoli on the 26 th of March in order to start his work and moved to Bolayir on the same day. Both of this movement and also the regulations that he took and intended to take in the district from the first week he came proved that he expected the most of British landings from the Gulf of Saros and the Anatolian coasts. Since then, the Headquarters of the Army and the affiliates was in Gallipoli. The 1 st Army Commander, Golç Pasha established his headquarters in Gallipoli. The 19 th Division Band was in Gallipoli. The 2 nd Light Supply Branch, the 3 rd Light Supply Branch, the 2 nd Heavy Supply Branch, the 3 rd Heavy Supply Branch, ammunition depots, mobile hospitals, and some part of the warehouses and workshops of the 3 rd Army Corps were in Gallipoli. The 5 th Army Range Inspectorate was established on 27 th March, 1915 in Gallipoli in order to meet the requirements of the 5 th Army. The troops sometimes were transferred to Gallipoli by ships, but most of the time it was done by the railway from Istanbul to Edirne and from Edirne to Uzunkopru and then from Uzunkopru to the front over Gallipoli on foot. A food center was established in Gallipoli in order for that the troops coming by the ships can receive hot meals when it is required. Since the flour mills in Tekirdag, Karabiga and Gallipoli were active, there was not a great difficulty for food supplies. One of the range warehouses was located in Gallipoli. The boarding of the 14 th Army Corps over the Sarkoy and Gallipoli was seen as appropriate by the Office of the Quartermaster. 36 It was seen as appropriate that the ammunition range line running between Uzunkopru and Gallipoli for the 5 th Army continued to operate in the same way previously and the branches given for this purpose was not given for another services. The Ministry of Defense had reported the needed order about the supply of 211 tons of meat which is the requirement of the 5 th Army for the month of May to the Lieutenant Governor of Gallipoli previously on the 3 rd of May. It had been stated by the answer received from the Gallipoli that that amount would be met, however they should not wait for any further aid for the month of June. It was stated for the reason that the number of population was really decreased due to the transferring of non-Muslim people in Gallipoli to the other places because of the war. Although the seizure procedures were not completed in the other townships and villages of Edirne province, 10. 000 cattle including rams, sheep and goats had been provided through the war levies. During the transferring back period, the people which were wounded and needed treatment had been treated after checking by a <b>Sanitary</b> <b>Assistance</b> Committee temporarily existing in Gallipoli and consisting of Army Chief of Medical Staff Sergeant and Army Headquarters Medical Staff and the ones needed treatment urgently as not be able to transfer back were taken from the ship and their referrals were made to the two hospitals in Gallipoli. The bed capacity of the Military Hospital of Gallipoli had been increased from 250 to 1000 before and also a Red Crescent hospital with a 200 -bed capacity in the French school and a 150 -bed war hospital were opened. These hospitals were moved to Lapseki partially and mostly to Tekirdag upon the bombarding of the Gallipoli centre. The remaining part having 150 beds was in the situation on the 4 th of May and left for the emergency cases. The Medical School students, who were employed in the hospitals of Istanbul province for the maintenance of the wounded increasing in number, were brought to Canakkale with the Sungurlu Battalion boarded the Ship of Resit Pasha in April, 1915 and then to Gallipoli under the auspices of the Ottoman destroyer and finally they were distributed to the hospitals...|$|E
