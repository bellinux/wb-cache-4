2500|$|Long {{before the}} horse collar harness, {{there was the}} less {{efficient}} throat-girth harness. This, it was claimed, {{could be found in}} many ancient civilizations, according to early 20th century French cavalry officer Lefebvre des Noëttes. This type of collar was supposedly used in ancient Chaldea (3rd millennium BC), both Sumeria and Assyria (1400–800 BC), ancient Egypt during the New Kingdom (1570–1070 BC), Shang Dynasty China (1600–1050 BC), Minoan Crete (2700–1450 BC), Classical Greece (550–323 BC), and ancient Rome (510 BC–476 AD). With this [...] "ancient harness," [...] ploughs and carts were pulled using harnesses that had flat straps across the neck and chest of the animal, with the load attached {{at the top of the}} collar, above the neck, in a manner similar to a yoke. These straps pressed against the horse's <b>sterno-cephalicus</b> muscle and trachea which restricted its breathing and reducing the pulling power of the horse. Thus, the harder a horse pulled, the more strongly it choked off its own breathing. [...] Because of these supposed physical constraints, oxen were used in preference to horses for heavy work, as they do not have this problem due to anatomical differences and could be yoked to their loads.|$|E
