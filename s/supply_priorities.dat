50|$|Though {{sufficient}} at a short range, {{the effectiveness}} of the 25 mm gun was far from optimal. On 14 January 1939 it was in principle decided to arm the Panhard with the 47 mm SA 35 gun but as this ordnance was in short <b>supply</b> <b>priority</b> had to be given to uparming tank types still equipped with the SA 34 gun, such as the Char B and the first Char D2 series. Already in the autumn of 1939 it was considered to build a number of tank destroyers, as too few units had a motorised anti-tank capacity.

50|$|The <b>Supply</b> <b>Priorities</b> and Allocation Board (SPAB) was a United States {{administrative}} entity {{within the}} Office for Emergency Management {{which was created}} and dissolved during World War II. The Board was created by President Franklin D. Roosevelt via Executive Order 8875 on August 28, 1941 and dissolved less than four months later. The purpose of the <b>Supply</b> <b>Priorities</b> and Allocation Board was to coordinate the distribution of materials and commodities related to national defense and to assist the Office of Production Management (OPM) in carrying out their overlapping duties. The Board's membership consisted of the Director General (William S. Knudsen) and Associate Director General (Sidney Hillman) of the OPM, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox, Administrator of the Office of Price Administration Leon Henderson, Chairman of the Economic Defense Board Henry A. Wallace (who was also the Vice President of the United States) and the Special Assistant to the President supervising the Lend-Lease program, Edward Stettinius, Jr.. The President retained the power to appoint an Executive Director and to select the Chairman of the Board from its members. The only Chairman of SPAB during its short lifespan was Vice President Wallace and its sole Executive Director was businessman Donald M. Nelson.|$|E
50|$|Less {{than four}} months after SPAB was created, the United States {{formally}} entered World War II when it declared war upon Japan on December 8, 1941. SPAB seemed poised to dramatically increase in importance. However, this increased significance was short-lived; on January 16, 1942, President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9024, establishing the War Production Board (WPB). The War Production Board superseded the <b>Supply</b> <b>Priorities</b> and Allocation Board and the Office of Production Management and absorbed both boards' duties. Donald M. Nelson, the former Executive Director of SPAB, became the first Chairman of the WPB.|$|E

Reed was a liaison to the Office of Production Management in Washington, D.C., which with the <b>Supply</b> <b>Priorities</b> and Allocation Board later became the War Production Board. He was an advisor to the Council of National Defense in 1941, which was a World War I organization that was reactivated for World War II and operated in 1940 and 1941.|$|E
50|$|T4 High-Velocity Armor Piercing (HVAP) {{ammunition}} {{became available}} in August 1944 for the 76 mm gun. The projectile contained a tungsten penetrator {{surrounded by a}} lightweight aluminum body and ballistic windshield, which gave it a higher velocity and more penetrating power. The increased penetration of HVAP allowed the 76 mm gun to match the Panther's 7.5 cm KwK 42 APCR shot. However, its performance was heavily degraded by sloped armor such as the Panther's glacis. Because of tungsten shortages, HVAP rounds were constantly in short <b>supply.</b> <b>Priority</b> was given to U.S. tank destroyer units and {{over half of the}} 18,000 projectiles received were not compatible with the 76 mm gun M1, being fitted into the cartridge case of the M10 tank destroyer's 3-inch gun M7. Most Shermans carried only a few rounds at any one time, and some units never received any.|$|R
25|$|On 12 September, XXXIII Corps {{attacked}} towards Mont St Quentin and VII Corps attacked Bouchavesnes, {{taking the}} village and digging in facing Cléry and Feuillaucourt. I Corps took Bois d'Anderlu and broke through the German defences near Marrières Wood, before attacking north towards Rancourt and Sailly-Saillisel. On 13 September, I Corps closed on Le Priez Farm and VII Corps defeated several big German counter-attacks. Next day the attacks of VII and XXXIII corps were stopped by mud and German defensive fire but I Corps managed to take Le Priez Farm. Attacks were suspended again to bring up supplies and relieve tired troops, despite the big British attack due on 15 September. Frégicourt, which overlooked part of the area to be attacked by the British was still held by the Germans.

50|$|During {{the second}} half of 1940, Axis successes and the {{possibility}} of American involvement in the spreading war heightened concerns about the nation's military readiness. With an eye to improving the efficiency of war production, in January, 1941 several agencies responsible for purchasing billions of dollars of war materials for the defense industry were reorganized into a central procurement agency, the Office of Production Management, with Nelson the director of priorities. As American war preparations continued to expand during 1941, new inefficiencies in the supply process were exposed, and in July a new agency, the <b>Supply</b> <b>Priorities</b> and Allocation Board (SPAB) was created to deal with them.

5000|$|Roosevelt {{had created}} a {{confusion}} of agencies to supervise war production. In January 1941 he ordered into being the Office of Production Management (OPM), headed by labor leader Sidney Hillman and business executive William S.

In July 1941 he formed another government department, the <b>Supply</b> <b>Priorities</b> and Allocation Board (SPAB) led by businessman Donald M. Nelson. The Truman Committee directed its attention on these [...] "alphabet soup" [...] organizations after hearing complaints of inefficiency. In August 1941 following a report by Truman to the Senate {{on the progress of}} the investigative committee, Republican Senator Arthur H.

5000|$|For {{the most}} part, this {{imbalance}} occurred because the Maritime Commission lacked the clout that the Military Branches possessed and that clout ultimately swayed entities {{such as the}} <b>Supply</b> <b>Priorities</b> and Allocation Board (SPAB) to decide {{in favor of the}} Navy's demands. This disproportionate allocation regime often left the Maritime Commission without the resources needed to accomplish the goals established for it by President Roosevelt and it was only through direct appeal to FDR by Admiral Land that enough of the critical resources made it to the Emergency Program. These shortages were their most severe during all of 1941 and through much of 1942, but additional steel rolling and plate mills as well as expanded propulsion machinery manufacturing capability reduced many of those shortages in the course of 1943, however they were never fully eliminated up {{until the end of the}} war. Materials such as oil, gasoline, rubber and grease were rationed for the fighting units and so the Pennsylvania Shipyard had to improvise, but bananas were very cheap, South American markets having been hampered by the war [...] Combat needs were top priority so alternative substances had to be found for materials such as the grease used to lubricate the ramp down which a boat slid into the water when launching. The boatbuilders found that ships could be launched handily by covering the ramp in a layer of ripe unpeeled bananas. It worked very well until a supervisor decided to cut costs by buying even cheaper green bananas. Of course, they were also very gummy and did not [...] "mush" [...] like ripe ones. The only time this was used, the boat went about one-third down the ramp and stuck. It took nearly two days to dig out the keel and lever the boat to the water where it floated quite well. Thereafter, the shipyard did not use any but well-ripened bananas. This happened to one of the boats being worked on by a young Texas A&M engineer named Keith Sandefer.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{considers}} the "inventory outsourcing problem " as a VaR (Value at Risk) problem providing {{a mechanism for}} managing outsourcing firms when the supplier is a leader having full information of the outsourcing firm's demand distributions and cost parameters. This leads to a Stackleberg game which is solved under a number of assumptions. Both demand dependent and independent models are considered, the latter resulting from (statistical) risk aggregation. A number of examples are solved as well to highlight essential issues underlying the practice of inventory outsourcing-price and <b>supply</b> <b>priorities.</b> These solutions can be be expressed as nonlinear optimization problems which can be solved by standard numerical routines.

40|$|Can we use {{the past}} to predict the future? Moore’s Law is a great example: {{performance}} doubles and prices halve approximately every 18 months. This trend has held up well to {{the test of time}} and is expected to continue for some time. Similar arguments can be found in speech demonstrating consistent progress over decades. Unfortunately, there are also cases where history repeats itself, as well as major dislocations, fundamental changes that invalidate fundamental assumptions. What will happen, for example, when petabytes become a commodity? Can demand keep up with supply? How much text and speech would it take to match this <b>supply?</b> <b>Priorities</b> will change. Search will become more important than coding and dictation. Figure 1 : Moore’s Law 1. Progress as a function of time Moore’s Law (Figure 1) uses past performance to predict future capability in a very convincing way. Figure 2 [1] demonstrates consistent progress in speech coding. Figure 3 [2] makes a similar argument for speech recognition; see [3] for predictions of where the field will go over the next 10 years. We have grown accustom under Moore’s Law to incredible improvements in disks, memory, CPU cycles, network bandwidth, etc. Performance doubles and prices halve every 18 months or so. The time constant varies considerably depending on physical limitations, market forces and other factors. Disk capacities, for example, have improved faster than disk seek times because of physical limitations. Market forces account for the dramatic improvements in PCs. PCs are not only cheaper than supercomputers, but ironically, they can be faster as well...|$|E
