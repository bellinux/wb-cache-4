25|$|Nancy Mitford {{writes in}} the first essay that the English {{aristocracy}} is the only real aristocracy {{left in the world}} today, even if it may seem {{to be on the verge}} of decadence: it has political power through the House of Lords and real social position through the Queen. Then she explains the order of precedence of dukes, marquesses, earls, viscounts, barons, members of a noble family, young sons, baronets, knights and knights of the Garter. Accused of being a snob, she quotes from Professor Alan Ross of Birmingham University who points out that “it is solely by their language that the upper classes nowadays are distinguished since they are neither cleaner, richer, nor better-educated than anybody else". Miss Mitford <b>says</b> <b>Professor</b> Ross invented the U and non-U English useful formula. Though she doesn't agree completely with the Professor's list, she adopts his classification system, and adds a few suggestions of her own. She gives many examples of U and non-U usage and thoroughly explains the aristocracy saying, for example, dukes are rather new creations, the purpose of the aristocrat is most emphatically not to work for money, and nobility in England is based on title and not on bloodline. The ancestors of the lords spent months abroad, buying pictures and statues, which they cheerfully sell in order to spend months abroad, she writes.|$|E
500|$|Just before Exton's mayorality {{ended in}} October 1387, the {{parliament}} held at Cambridge by the victorious opponents of Richard II formally pardoned him for any treasons or felonies {{he may have}} committed in the previous years, and this parliament also forbade Londoners from making any criticisms of Exton regarding alleged derogation of the city's liberties. This referred to a rumour that in the previous (February 1388) parliament Exton [...] "sought to jeopardise the liberties of the city by petitioning parliament to make Robert Knolles captain of the city"; but that the lords, sitting in council in parliament, [...] "have been questioned about this matter... have concluded that Exton {{made no attempt to}} do this by petition or otherwise." [...] In May earlier that year, Exton had loaned the Appellant-controlled government the large sum of £1,000; for context, at the same time, the whole city lent £5,000. On the other hand, he was also actively profiting from the situation. [...] One of the responsibilities that the King's new officers (imposed on him after the Wonderful Parliament) had was to dispose of the forfeited estates of those condemned by the Appellants, a responsibility they enacted with zeal, and [...] "at what were, we may suspect, attractive prices." [...] Exton, <b>says</b> <b>Professor</b> Charles Ross, was one of their biggest buyers. He paid 500 marks for some de la Pole estates, and 700 marks for a manor of Sir John Holt's.|$|E

6000|$|This means, of course, {{that the}} poet is {{composing}} a Christmas Hymn {{in his native}} language. We must note his age at this time,--twenty-one years: he is a student at Cambridge.

50|$|Both {{candidates}} in the running for Chief Executive of Hong Kong, Henry Tang and Leung Chun-ying, criticised Kong's public statement. Henry Tang responded by <b>saying</b> <b>professor</b> Kong needs {{to be responsible for}} his own statement and that Hong Kong citizens are not dogs. He emphasised this is how Hong Kong citizens deal with each other in a free society. On the other hand, Leung Chun-ying said that Kong's statement did not actually reflect the views of Mainland Chinese. He added that {{this is part of the}} Hong Kong spirit to respect the law, and that Kong Qingdong should not be over-reacting.|$|R

6000|$|In Cornwall, {{strange to}} say, it {{is a young}} {{unmarried}} woman who, standing in the church porch at midnight on Midsummer's-eve, sees the strange gathering.

60|$|No, <b>says</b> <b>Professor</b> Tiele, 'the {{story of}} Cronos has {{precisely}} the opposite meaning.' The New Zealand myth {{is one of}} dawn, the Greek myth is one of sunset. The mutilated part of poor Ouranos is le phallus du ciel, le soleil, which falls into 'the Cosmic ocean,' and then, of course, all is dark. Professor Tiele may be right here; I am indifferent. All that I wanted to explain was the savage complexion of the myth, and Professor Tiele says that I have explained that, and (xii. 264) he rejects the etymological theory of Mr. Max Muller.|$|E
6000|$|... "The tone of {{the letter}} {{throughout}} was expressly calculated to prejudice Calvin on the point submitted to him," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Professor</b> Hume Brown. {56} Calvin replied that the quarrel might be all very well if the exiles were happy and at ease in their circumstances, though in the Liturgy, as described, there were [...] "tolerable (endurable) follies." [...] On the whole he sided with the Knoxian party. The English Liturgy is not pure enough; and the English exiles, not at Frankfort, merely like it because they are accustomed to it. Some are partial to [...] "popish dregs." ...|$|E
