5|$|In {{the second}} {{semifinal}} match, <b>Sabin</b> and Shocker defeated Dutt and Killings at 7 minutes and 49 seconds. During the contest, <b>Sabin</b> accidentally hit his teammate Shocker in the face. This {{led to some}} confusion in the match, allowing Killings to get a near-fall on <b>Sabin.</b> This was later resolved, with <b>Sabin</b> getting the pin on Dutt via la magistral.|$|E
5|$|The {{final round}} {{occurred}} on the September 9 episode of Impact!, with <b>Sabin</b> and Shocker versus Shelley and Waltman. This contest lasted 7 minutes and 20 seconds. <b>Sabin</b> and Shelley started off the match, with Shelley dominating <b>Sabin</b> with mat submission holds. The wrestling left the ring as Waltman performed a somersault splash to the ringside area onto Shocker and <b>Sabin.</b> Later, <b>Sabin</b> ascended to the top-rope to perform a dropkick onto Shelley, to only have Shelley dodge out of the way, resulting in <b>Sabin</b> hitting his partner Shocker instead. After checking on Shocker, <b>Sabin</b> turned around and was met with a kick to the jaw from Shelley. <b>Sabin</b> left the ring after this due to a legitimate injury. With Shocker left and the referee attending to other matters, Waltman hit Shocker in the groin and followed by performing his X-Factor maneuver to gain the pinfall victory and to win the tournament.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} contest pitted Chris <b>Sabin</b> against Petey Williams, lasting 12 {{minutes and}} 34 seconds. The bout was originally scheduled as <b>Sabin</b> facing his tag team {{partner in the}} Chris Candido Memorial Tag Team Tournament, Shocker. However, Shocker was unable to attend the show {{and was replaced by}} Williams. Williams held <b>Sabin</b> by Sabin's legs in a Sharpshooter submission hold twice during the match, with <b>Sabin</b> forcing Williams to release the hold both times. Near the end, Williams went to perform his signature Canadian Destroyer maneuver on <b>Sabin,</b> before <b>Sabin</b> countered the move into his signature Cradle Shock maneuver. After lifting up and slamming Williams back and neck-first into the mat, <b>Sabin</b> followed with the pinfall to win the encounter. Matt Bentleyformally known as Michael Shanereturned to TNA by attacking <b>Sabin</b> and Williams after the bout.

5|$|At {{the same}} time that Salk was testing his vaccine, both Albert <b>Sabin</b> and Hilary Koprowski {{continued}} working on developing a vaccine using live virus. During a meeting in Stockholm to discuss polio vaccines in November 1955, <b>Sabin</b> presented results obtained on a group of 80 volunteers, while Koprowski read a paper detailing the findings of a trial enrolling 150 people. <b>Sabin</b> and Koprowski both eventually succeeded in developing vaccines. Because of the commitment to the Salk vaccine in America, <b>Sabin</b> and Koprowski both did their testing outside of the United States, <b>Sabin</b> in Mexico and then in the Soviet Union, and Koprowski in the Congo and Poland. In 1957, <b>Sabin</b> developed a trivalent vaccine, containing attenuated strains of all three types of poliovirus. In 1959, ten million children in the Soviet Union received the <b>Sabin</b> oral vaccine. For this work, <b>Sabin</b> was given the medal of the Order of Friendship Among Peoples, described as the Soviets' highest civilian honor, despite having become an American {{during the height of the}} cold war. Sabin's oral vaccine using live virus came into commercial use in 1961. Once Sabin’s oral vaccine became widely available, it supplanted Salk’s injected vaccine because it was cheaper to produce and easier to administer.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} match, Samoa Joe was pitted against Chris <b>Sabin.</b> Joe {{performed}} his signature Muscle Buster maneuver and then placed <b>Sabin</b> in his signature submission hold the Coquina Clutch. Instead of submitting, <b>Sabin</b> instead passed out in storyline, with the referee lifting and raising his arm {{three times before}} giving the victory to Joe at 14 minutes and 2 seconds.|$|E
5|$|OPV {{is usually}} {{provided}} in vials containing 10–20 doses of vaccine. A single dose of {{oral polio vaccine}} (usually two drops) contains 1,000,000 infectious units of <b>Sabin</b> 1 (effective against PV1), 100,000 infectious units of the <b>Sabin</b> 2 strain, and 600,000 infectious units of <b>Sabin</b> 3. The vaccine contains small traces of antibiotics—neomycin and streptomycin—but does not contain preservatives.|$|E
5|$|TNA {{promoted}} a Three Way {{match for the}} TNA X Division Championship between then-champion Christopher Daniels and the challengers Chris <b>Sabin</b> and Michael Shane heading into Slammiversary. At Hard Justice, <b>Sabin</b> teamed with Traci to face the team of Shane and Trinity in a Mixed Tag Team match. The match ended with Traci and Shane turning on their partners, forming an alliance. On the May20 episode of Impact!, Shane attacked Daniels and demanded a championship match; then <b>Sabin</b> attacked Shane, resulting in a brawl between the three wrestlers which was broken up by security. The following week on Impact!, <b>Sabin</b> made an alliance with Trinity and Daniels versus <b>Sabin</b> and versus Shane for the title was promoted for Slammiversary.|$|E
5|$|There are 57 {{nucleotide}} substitutions which {{distinguish the}} attenuated <b>Sabin</b> 1 strain from its virulent parent (the Mahoney serotype), two nucleotide substitutions attenuate the <b>Sabin</b> 2 strain, and 10 substitutions {{are involved in}} attenuating the <b>Sabin</b> 3 strain. The primary attenuating factor common to all three <b>Sabin</b> vaccines is a mutation located in the virus's internal ribosome entry site (IRES) which alters stem-loop structures, and reduces the ability of poliovirus to translate its RNA template within the host cell. The attenuated poliovirus in the <b>Sabin</b> vaccine replicates very efficiently in the gut, the primary site of infection and replication, but is unable to replicate efficiently within nervous system tissue.|$|E
5|$|A Mixed Tag Team {{match between}} {{the team of}} Michael Shane and Trinity and the team of Chris <b>Sabin</b> and Traci was held next. The match lasted ten minutes and {{nineteen}} seconds. In the final moments of the bout, Traci hit <b>Sabin</b> in the groin and Shane kicked Trinity in the face, which allowed Shane to gain the pinfall on <b>Sabin.</b> After Traci and Shane betrayed their partners, they united an alliance of their own.|$|E
5|$|Chris Sabin's jaw {{was broken}} {{in the final}} round match. <b>Sabin</b> needed serious medical {{assistance}} afterwards backstage due to excessive bleeding from the mouth. <b>Sabin</b> had to cancel an August 19 Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG) appearance as a result. Shelley was also injured while taking part in the tournament. He suffered a legitimate back injury, but ended up appearing at the PWG show that <b>Sabin</b> was forced to miss. There, he aggravated the injury further, forcing him to miss two Ring of Honor shows for which he was scheduled.|$|E
5|$|The TNA X Division Championship was defended next in {{what was}} {{originally}} promoted as a Three Way match but was fought under elimination rules. Christopher Daniels defended the title against Chris <b>Sabin,</b> who was accompanied by Trinity, and Michael Shane, who was accompanied by Traci. Near the 11 minute mark, <b>Sabin</b> eliminated Shane after performing his signature Cradle Shock maneuver.

In the weeks leading to the encounter, <b>Sabin</b> stated {{he had found a}} counter to Williams' finishing maneuver the Canadian Destroyer, which was thought to be uncounterable. The Canadian Destroyer involves Williams grabbing an opponent with his legs around their head, jumping over their back, causing them to perform a backflip, and forcing their head into the mat after they make the full rotation. Making true to his word, <b>Sabin</b> countered the move three times before Turning Point; one on the November 12, one of the November 19, and the last on the November 30 episodes of Impact!.|$|E

5|$|Oral {{polio vaccine}} (OPV) is an {{attenuated}} vaccine, {{produced by the}} passage of the virus through non-human cells at a sub-physiological temperature, which produces spontaneous mutations in the viral genome. Oral polio vaccines were developed by several groups, one of which was led by Albert <b>Sabin.</b> Other groups, led by Hilary Koprowski and H.R. Cox, developed their own attenuated vaccine strains. In 1958, the National Institutes of Health created a special committee on live polio vaccines. The various vaccines were carefully evaluated for their ability to induce immunity to polio, while retaining a low incidence of neuropathogenicity in monkeys. Large-scale clinical trials performed in the Soviet Union in late 1950s to early 1960s by Mikhail Chumakov and his colleagues demonstrated safety and high efficacy of the vaccine. Based on these results, the <b>Sabin</b> strains were chosen for worldwide distribution.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, Albert <b>Sabin</b> {{developed}} another live, oral polio vaccine. It {{was produced}} by the repeated passage of the virus through nonhuman cells at subphysiological temperatures. The attenuated poliovirus in the <b>Sabin</b> vaccine replicates very efficiently in the gut, the primary site of wild poliovirus infection and replication, but the vaccine strain is unable to replicate efficiently within nervous system tissue. A single dose of Sabin's oral polio vaccine produces immunity to all three poliovirus serotypes in about 50 percent of recipients. Three doses of live-attenuated oral vaccine produce protective antibody to all three poliovirus types in more than 95 percent of recipients. Human trials of Sabin's vaccine began in 1957, and in 1958 it was selected, in competition with the live vaccines of Koprowski and other researchers, by the US National Institutes of Health. Licensed in 1962, it rapidly became the only polio vaccine used worldwide.|$|E
