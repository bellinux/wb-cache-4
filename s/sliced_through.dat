5|$|Finucane's {{start at}} No. 452 was unimpressive. On 3 May 1941 {{while on a}} {{recognition}} flight with his new commanding officer, Squadron Leader Roy Dutton, Finucane got too close and his propeller <b>sliced</b> <b>through</b> Dutton's tailplane. Finucane radioed Dutton immediately. Dutton attempted to abandon the aircraft but was too low and crash-landed, cracking several ribs but surviving. Finucane excused himself from error asserting that his Spitfire {{was the only one}} with a metal propeller—the others being elder Mark I's with wooden mounts—which gave him extra speed. In tight formation, this had caused the collision. Despite the incident, he was gazetted on 13 May and given temporary command of the squadron while Dutton was injured. While at 452 Finucane became a popular commander and encouraged a more relaxed atmosphere, which he believed would help him get more out of the Australian pilots. He was now in command of 23 pilots, 16 fighters and 130 ground crew.|$|E
25|$|The once-strong farmer's market, Haymarket, ceased {{operations}} in 1962 after 71 years of operation. The final death-knell for the Haymarket, already in decline due to changing economic trends, was {{the construction of}} an Interstate 65 ramp through {{the main part of the}} open-air market. Not only did interstates facilitate suburban living, they <b>sliced</b> <b>through</b> older city neighborhoods and often divided them irreversibly.|$|E
25|$|Subsequent {{depositions}} {{revealed that}} Lt Wilson flew his B-34 {{level with the}} DC-3 and rocked his wings in greeting to First Officer Reppert. When Flight 28 did not respond in kind, the B-34 crossed over the airliner's line of flight and throttled back to allow the slower DC-3 to catch up. Lt Wilson flew close to the airliner to attempt a second greeting, but misjudged {{the distance between the}} aircraft, and when he tried to pull up, the B-34's right propeller <b>sliced</b> <b>through</b> the airliner's tail.|$|E

25|$|Unlike at the North Tower, initially, one of {{the three}} {{stairwells}} was still intact after Flight175 crashed into the South Tower. This was because the plane struck the tower offset from the center and not centrally as Flight 11 in the North Tower had done. Only 18 people passed the impact zone through the available stairway and left the South Tower safely before it collapsed. One of them, Stanley Praimnath, was on the 81st floor, and his office suffered a direct hit. He witnessed Flight 175 coming toward him. One of the wings <b>sliced</b> <b>through</b> his office and wound up wedged in a doorway approximately 20 feet away from him.|$|E
25|$|As {{the team}} closed out August, United {{continued}} to struggle mightily. Bill Hamid {{was back in}} goal as the team made {{a trip to the}} New York Red Bulls home field. Without Espindola though, United's attack remained absolutely toothless. NYRB dominated the midfield, perhaps in part because United was playing without Arnaud, who had suffered a concussion against San Jose. Hamid made some pivotal saves early on, but the floodgates eventually opened as the Red Bulls repeatedly <b>sliced</b> <b>through</b> the United defense, utterly dominating the contest which finished 3–0 in favor of NYRB. The loss left United clinging to a 2-point lead in the Eastern Conference, but NYRB held 3 games in hand.|$|E
25|$|Other {{traditional}} neighborhoods include San Lucas, San Mateo, El Niño Jesús, San Francisco and San Antonio. The San Lucas and San Mateo barrios are <b>sliced</b> <b>through</b> {{by small}} arroyos {{and used to}} be surrounded by cornfields and pastures for cattle. The El Niño Jesús and San Francisco barrios and filled with very winding alleyways over black volcanic rock, called pedregal, from an ancient eruption of Xitle. These two are separated from the historic center by Avenida Miguel A de Quevedo. The San Antonio barrio is very small with an equally small chapel by the name of San Antonio Panzacola. This chapel belonged to the Carmelites and is located alongside an old stone bridge over the Río Magdalena.|$|E

25|$|Both {{aircraft}} collided in cloud at {{an altitude}} of 8400 meters, approximately over Dniprodzerzhynsk. Flight 7880's right wing <b>sliced</b> <b>through</b> Flight 7628's forward fuselage, tearing off part of 7880's right wing, the debris of which was ingested by 7880's right engine. The impact spun 7628 to the right, causing the tails of both aircraft to collide at which time the left engine of 7628 struck the keel of 7880, and 7628's right wing was torn off. Flight 7628 tumbled out of control and broke up, with debris scattered over an area measuring 16 by 3 kilometers. Damage to 7880 included the loss of most of the empennage, one of the engines and a section of the right wing. The pilots of 7880 attempted an emergency landing, but {{at an altitude}} of approximately 4000 meters they lost control and at 13:38 crashed to the ground north-east of Kamianske, completely destroying the aircraft.|$|E
500|$|In 1997, Clive Woodward became England's coach. That year, England drew with New Zealand at Twickenham {{after being}} heavily {{defeated}} in Manchester the week before. England toured Australia, New Zealand and South Africa in 1998. Many of the England team made themselves unavailable {{for the tour}} nicknamed the [...] "tour from hell" [...] where England were beaten 76–0 by the Wallabies. In 1999 during the last ever Five Nations match, Scott Gibbs <b>sliced</b> <b>through</b> six English tackles to score in the last minute, and the last ever Five Nations title went to Scotland.|$|E
500|$|Both of {{the upper}} aircraft's engines had been knocked out in the {{collision}} but those of the one below continued to turn at full power as the interlocked Ansons began to slowly circle. Fuller described the [...] "freak combination" [...] as [...] "lumping along like a brick". He nevertheless {{found that he was}} able to control the piggybacking pair of aircraft with his ailerons and flaps, and began searching for a place to land. The two navigators, Sinclair and Fraser, bailed out, followed soon after by the lower Anson's pilot, Hewson, whose back had been injured when the spinning blades of the other aircraft <b>sliced</b> <b>through</b> his fuselage.|$|E

500|$|Much of {{the great}} {{progress}} on the electromagnetic process {{can be attributed to}} Lawrence's leadership style. His audacity, optimism and enthusiasm were contagious. His staff put in long hours, and University of California administrators <b>sliced</b> <b>through</b> red tape despite not knowing what the project was about. Government officials began to view the development of atomic bombs in time to affect the outcome of the war as a genuine possibility. Vannevar Bush, the director of the OSRD, which was overseeing the project, visited Berkeley in February 1942, and found the atmosphere there [...] "stimulating" [...] and [...] "refreshing". On 9 March 1942, he reported to the president, Franklin D. Roosevelt, that {{it might be possible to}} produce enough material for a bomb by mid-1943, based on new estimates from Robert Oppenheimer that the critical mass of a sphere of pure uranium-235 was between 2.0 and 2.5 kilograms.|$|E

A post crash fire caused the bomb load to explode blowing out the windowns of houses in the village including the nearby church. A plaque in the village church, St Marys, shows {{the names of those}} who perished in the crash.|$|E
2500|$|Vaughn's brigade held heights {{north of}} Vicksburg {{for the first}} four months of 1863. On May 17, Grant's forces <b>sliced</b> <b>through</b> the Confederate line at the [...] Battle of Big Black River Bridge forcing the {{surrender}} of two of Vaughn's regiments. The Confederates retreated into Vicksburg where they eventually surrendered on July 4. Vaughn was paroled and in October began reassembling his troops. He won a skirmish against Union troops in Philadelphia, TN, and also combated marauders in his Monroe County. Working with Longstreet to try and take Knoxville in December, Vaughn was forced to retreat to upper East Tennessee. In late December, Vaughn was authorized to mount his brigade.|$|E

2500|$|Following Australia's second Test {{victory on}} tour against Ireland (won 16-9), Campese came-on as a late {{replacement}} in Australia's 9-16 loss to Ulster. Replacing James Black, Campese [...] "set up another try {{with his first}} touch." [...] Terry Cooper reports that, [...] "He <b>sliced</b> <b>through</b> the defence, Hawker and Lynagh moved the ball on briskly and Grigg scored easily." [...] However, Ulster's winning penalty was kicked following a penalty awarded against Campese. Campese was rested {{for the next two}} tour matches against Munster (won 31-19) and Llanelli (lost 16-19), prior to the Wallabies' third tour Test against Wales, won 28-9. Some time between Australia's second Test victory over Ireland and its third Test over Wales, Campese fell ill with the flu.|$|E

Stuart {{suffered}} great pain as an ambulance took him to Richmond to await his wife's arrival at the home of Dr. Charles Brewer, his brother-in-law. Stuart ordered his sword and spurs be given to his son. His last whispered words were: [...] "I am resigned; God's will be done." [...] He died at 7:38p.m. on May 12, the following day, before Flora Stuart reached his side. He was 31 years old. Stuart was buried in Richmond's Hollywood Cemetery. Upon learning of Stuart's death, General Lee is reported to have said that he could hardly keep from weeping at the mere mention of Stuart's name and that Stuart had never given him a bad piece of information.|$|E
2500|$|Soon Hungary itself {{became a}} battlefield. Szálasi promised a Greater Hungary and {{prosperity}} for the peasants, {{but in reality}} Hungary was crumbling and its armies were slowly being destroyed. As {{an integral part of}} German General Maximilian Fretter-Pico's Armeegruppe Fretter-Pico, the re-formed Hungarian Second Army enjoyed a modest level of combat success. [...] From 6 October to 29 October 1944, during the Battle of Debrecen, Armeegruppe Fretter-Pico managed to achieve a major win on the battlefield. Avoiding encirclement itself, Armeegruppe Fretter-Pico encircled and severely mauled three Soviet tank corps serving under the Mobile Group of Issa Pliyev. Earlier in the same battle, Mobile Group Pliyev had <b>sliced</b> <b>through</b> the Hungarian Third Army. But success was costly and, unable to replace lost armor and heavy artillery munitions, the Hungarian Second Army was defeated on 1 December 1944. [...] The remnants of the Second Army were incorporated into the Third Army.|$|E

2500|$|Power of the two-man combination: Netherlands vs Brazil, 1974. Simple as it is, the 2-man move can {{penetrate}} {{the teeth of}} the densest, most negative opposition. Peru brought it to a high art on the World Cup stage in 1970, under their coach Didi, Brazil's former midfield general of 1958 and 1962. Time after time Peruvian forwards like Cubillas, Gallardo, and Sotil put a central combination on the floor that <b>sliced</b> <b>through</b> the opposition and created countless dangerous situations. The Dutch team of 1974 were also disciples of the two-man combination. The diagram here shows the first Dutch goal in the 1974 game that crushed Brazil's repeat championship hopes - product of an exchange between Johan Neeskens and Johan Cruyff. A two-man move also set up the second goal for Cruyff in the game. Contrast with the [...] "hand" [...] of Diego Maradona below.|$|E
2500|$|In 1934, Olympic again {{struck a}} ship. The {{approaches}} to New York {{were marked by}} lightships and Olympic, like other liners, had been known to pass close by these vessels. On 15 May 1934, Olympic, inbound in heavy fog, was homing in on the radio beacon of Nantucket Lightship LV-117. Now {{under the command of}} Captain John Binks, the ship failed to turn in time and <b>sliced</b> <b>through</b> the smaller vessel, which broke apart and sank. Four of the lightship's crew went down with the vessel and seven were rescued, of whom three died of their injuries – thus there were seven fatalities out of a crew of eleven. The lightship's surviving crew and Olympics captain were interviewed soon after reaching shore. [...] One crewman said it all happened so quickly that they didn't know how it happened. [...] The captain was very sorry it happened but said Olympic reacted very quickly lowering boats to rescue the crew, which was confirmed by an injured crewman.|$|E
