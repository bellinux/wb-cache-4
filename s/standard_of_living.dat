5|$|Social conditions, the <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> and the {{self-confidence}} of {{the workers}} gradually improved due to industrialization between 1870–1916, but while the <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> rose among the common people, the rift {{between rich and poor}} deepened markedly. The commoners' rising awareness of the socioeconomic and political questions interacted with the ideas of socialism, social liberalism and nationalism (Fennomania). The workers' responses and the corresponding counteracts of the dominating upper factions steepened the social relations in Finland.|$|E

5|$|However, some {{problems}} have been encountered with basing agencies in the eastern states.

Based on the comparative method, both cities are first analysed from the perspective <b>of</b> chosen <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> and then compared.

Playford's attitude to social welfare was also criticised. He said that it was up to charity, not the government, to support orphans and disadvantaged sectors of the community so that they could enjoy a better <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>living.</b> Spending on social welfare lagged behind that in other states, and legislative reforms on this front were non-existent.|$|E
5|$|During the {{oil boom}} of the 1970s, Nigeria joined OPEC and the huge oil {{revenues}} it was generating enriched the economy. Despite these revenues, the military government did little to improve the <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>living</b> of the population, help small and medium businesses, or invest in infrastructure. As oil revenues fueled the rise of federal subsidies to states, the federal government became the centre of political struggle and the threshold {{of power in the}} country. As oil production and revenue rose, the Nigerian government became increasingly dependent on oil revenues and on international commodity markets for budgetary and economic concerns. It did not develop alternate revenue sources in the economy for economic stability. That spelled doom to federalism in Nigeria.|$|E
