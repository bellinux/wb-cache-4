In the article the author tries {{to prove a}} statement that a so-called “functional definition,” especially connected with Weberian perspective, essentially is not a definition, so the traditional classification is unjustifiable. The author introduces three criteria of correct definition in science: formal — definition must specify its object; epistemic — must be communicative; and investigative — must be useful to research. As it turns out, a “functional definition” collapses at the first stage, because it necessarily includes an idem per idem error. Many sociologists try to avoid the fallacy, supplementing its definition by <b>substantial</b> <b>equivalences,</b> however {{it is a sign}} of its inefficiency. Even if one skips this problem hypothetically, the others (errors of static and generality) are coming. “Functional definition” is no definition at all.

40|$|Signals {{delivered}} by the CD 40 ligand, CD 154, have crucial roles in immune responses in mammals, being required for development of germinal centres, maturation of T-dependent antibody responses, and generation of B-cell memory. To determine whether these functions were conserved in a non-mammalian species, a putative chicken CD 154 cDNA was used to make an oligomeric fusion protein, and to raise monoclonal antibodies. The antibodies detected surface expression on activated T-cells. The fusion protein detected expression of a receptor on B-cells, thrombocytes and macrophages. Biological effects of the fusion protein included induction of NO synthesis in a macrophage cell line, enhancement of splenic B-cell survival, and induction of apoptosis in a bursal lymphoma cell line.

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of tidally flushed, semi-enclosed basins with negligible freshwater inflow, and under steady periodic flow conditions, three frequently used local transport time scales to quantify the efficiency of water renewal, namely water age, exposure time, and local flushing time are studied and compared to each other. In these environments, water renewal is strongly controlled by diffusion, and it is significantly affected by the return flow (i. e., the fraction of effluent water that returns into the basin on each flood tide). The definition of water age is here modified {{to account for the}} return flow, in analogy with exposure time and local flushing time. We consider approximate time scales, whose accuracy is analyzed, in order to overcome problems related {{to the size of the}} computational domain and to reduce the computational effort. A new approximate procedure is introduced to estimate water age, which is based on the water aging rate. Also, the concept of local flushing time as a relevant time scale is introduced. Under steady periodic conditions, we demonstrate that the local flushing time quantitatively corresponds to water age, and well approximates exposure time when the flow is dominated by diffusion. Since the effort required to compute water age and exposure time is greater than that required to compute the local flushing time, the present results can also have a practical interest in the assessment of water renewal efficiency of semi-enclosed water basins. The results of a modeling study, in which the lagoon of Venice is used as a benchmark, confirm the <b>substantial</b> quantitative <b>equivalence</b> between these three transport time scales in highly diffusive environments...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of the enantiomeric purity of chiral carboxylic acids requires a reagent to give acceptable NMR chemical shift non-equivalence {{with a wide range}} of substrate acids. Extensive studies of the behaviour of N-mono- methyl, N,N-dimethyl and cyclic amines as chiral solvating agents led to the finding that 1, 2 diphenyl- 1, 2 -diaminoethane can induce <b>substantial</b> non- <b>equivalence</b> in the diastereomeric salts of chiral a-phenyl and a-halo carboxylic acids. The diastereoisomeric complexes of the diamine with primary carboxylic acids (RCH(_ 2) CO(_ 2) H) presents an unusual case in which the internally enantiotopic methylene protons are rendered internally diasteretopic by an external non-covalently bonded reagent. Investigations of the physical parameters determining non-equivalence (stoichiometry, concentration, temperature and substrate enantiomeric purity), combined with NOE observations of the diastereomeric pairs and the crystal structure of the mono- hydrobromide salt were used to suggest the structure for the conformation responsible for shift non-equivalence. The zero valent platinum complex, 3 - 0 -isopropylidene- 2, 3 -dihydroxy- 1, 4 - bis(diphenyl-phosphino) butane-platinum(0) -ethene (DlOP-Pt-ethene) was shown to be a versatile chiral derivatising agent for electron poor and strained η(^ 2) -donors. This was demonstrated by the enantiomeric purity determinations for alkynes, enones and norbornene derivatives. The crystal structure of DIOP-Pt-ethene was determined and found to be similar to the palladium analogue. If the achiral rhodium complex rhodium(I) -acetylacetone-diethene undergoes a reaction with 2 equivalents of a suitable chiral η(^ 2) -donor, it will result in the formation of 4 stereoisomers, two meso forms and a pair of enantiomers. The diasteroisomers should display chemical shift non-equivalence in the NMR spectrum of the product, reflecting the enantiomeric purity of the η(^ 2) -donor (self recognition). The derivatisation of rhodium(l) -acetylacetone-diethene with chiral η(^ 2) -donors was attempted...|$|R
40|$|Necrotic {{enteritis}} (NE) is {{an economically}} important enteric disease of broiler chicken primarily caused by a-toxin (Cpa) secreted by C. perfringens type A. Mice immunized with recombinant C-terminal domain of Cpa (CpaCD) had transient and fewer localized lesions upon challenge with C. perfringens type A. These results demonstrate {{the usefulness of}} CpaCD as an immunogen for vaccine development against NE for chickens. Chicken CD 40 (chCD 40) is mainly expressed {{on the surface of}} chicken antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and the interaction of chCD 40 and chCD 40 L (natural ligand for chCD 40) provides crucial activation signals for chicken B-cells. A hypothesis was proposed that in ovo vaccination with an adenovirus-vectored CpaCD vaccine capable of targeting immunogen to APCs through the CD 40 pathway will improve protection against NE in chickens. One agonistic monoclonal anti-chCD 40 antibody (designated 2 C 5) was produced and characterized. 2 C 5 not only detected expression of chCD 40 on chicken APCs, but also induced NO synthesis in chicken HD 11 macrophages and enhanced proliferation of serum-starved chicken DT 40 B-cells. This demonstrated <b>substantial</b> functional <b>equivalence</b> of 2 C 5 with chCD 40 L. The potential of 2 C 5 as an immunological adjuvant was further assessed by targeting a hapten to chicken APCs in hopes of enhancing an effective IgG response. Seven-week old chickens were immunized subcutaneously once with a complex consisting of 2 C 5 and peptide, and relative quantification of the peptide-specific IgG response showed that this complex was able to elicit a strong IgG response as early as four days post-immunization. This demonstrates that CD 40 -targeting antigen to chicken APCs can significantly enhance antibody responses and induce immunoglobulin isotype-switching. An agonistic anti-chCD 40 single-chain variable fragment (designated DAG 1) was combined with an adenoviral delivery system to create a vaccine, Ad-(DAG 1 -Cp aCD-FLAG), for in ovo administration. The efficacy of in ovo vaccination of broilers with Ad-(DAG 1 -Cp aCD-FLAG) in controlling NE was evaluated by C. perfringens type A challenge at 18 days post-hatch. Neither statistically significant IgA / IgG response nor protection against C. perfringens type A challenge was found in the vaccinated birds. These preliminary data suggest that a super-optimal dose of Ad-(DAG 1 -Cp aCD-FLAG) may be the main issue, because Cpa-specific B-cells may undergo apoptosis through the CD 40 pathway...|$|R

5000|$|Kuiper {{examined}} {{this process}} further in 2002, finding that <b>substantial</b> <b>equivalence</b> does not measure absolute risks, but instead identifies differences between new and existing products. He claimed that characterizing differences is properly {{a starting point}} for a safety assessment and [...] "the concept of <b>substantial</b> <b>equivalence</b> is an adequate tool in order to identify safety issues related to genetically modified products that have a traditional counterpart". Kuiper noted practical difficulties in applying this standard, including the fact that traditional foods contain many toxic or carcinogenic chemicals and that existing diets were never proven to be safe. This lack of knowledge re conventional food means that modified foods may differ in anti-nutrients and natural toxins that have never been identified in the original plant, possibly allowing harmful changes to be missed. In turn, positive modifications may also be missed. For example, corn damaged by insects often contains high levels of fumonisins, carcinogenic toxins made by fungi that travel on insects' backs and that grow in the wounds of damaged corn. Studies show that most Bt corn has lower levels of fumonisins than conventional insect-damaged corn. Workshops and consultations organized by the OECD, WHO, and FAO have worked to acquire data and develop better understanding of conventional foods, for use in assessing GM foods.|$|E
