50|$|The {{shape of}} a glass can have a {{significant}} effect on how much one pours. A Cornell University study of students and bartenders' pouring showed both groups pour more into <b>short,</b> wide <b>glasses</b> than into tall, slender glasses. Aiming to pour one shot of alcohol (1.5 ounces or 44.3 ml), students on average poured 45.5 ml & 59.6 ml (30% more) respectively into the tall and <b>short</b> <b>glasses.</b> The bartenders scored similarly, on average pouring 20.5% more into the <b>short</b> <b>glasses.</b> More experienced bartenders were more accurate, pouring 10.3% less alcohol than less experienced bartenders. Practice reduced the tendency of both groups to over pour for tall, slender glasses but not for <b>short,</b> wide <b>glasses.</b> These misperceptions are attributed to two perceptual biases: (1) Estimating that tall, slender glasses have more volume than shorter, wider glasses; and (2) Over focusing on the height of the liquid and disregarding the width.|$|R

The longest glass particle was observed in group 1 (immediate aspiration). This can be explained by long glass particles in group 2 (2  min delay) settling {{down to the bottom of}} ampules due to their weight, and filters in group 3 (filtered needle) and group 4 (side shooting) filtering out long glass particles. Since the diameter of pulmonary vasculature is less than 10  μm, they may cause harmful side effects to patients in the medium to long term.|$|R

50|$|A Büchner flask, {{also known}} as a vacuum flask, filter flask, suction flask, {{side-arm}} flask or Kitasato flask, is a thick-walled Erlenmeyer flask with a <b>short</b> <b>glass</b> tube and hose barb protruding about an inch from its neck. The short tube and hose barb effectively act as an adapter over which the end of a thick-walled flexible hose (tubing) can be fitted to form a connection to the flask. The other end of the hose can be connected to source of vacuum such as an aspirator, vacuum pump, or house vacuum. Preferably this is done through a trap (see below), which is designed to prevent the sucking back of water from the aspirator into the Büchner flask.|$|E
50|$|A <b>short</b> <b>glass</b> bottle {{used for}} beer is {{generally}} called a stubby, or originally a steinie. Shorter and flatter than standard bottles, stubbies pack into a smaller space for transporting. The steinie {{was introduced in}} the 1930s by Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company and derived their name from their similarity to the shape of a beer stein, which was emphasized in marketing. The bottles are sometimes made with thick glass so that the bottle can be cleaned and reused before being recycled. The capacity of a stubby is generally somewhere between 330 and 375 ml. The Canadian stubby bottle was traditionally 341 ml while the U.S. longneck was 355 ml. Some of the expected advantages of stubby bottles are: ease of handling; less breakage; lighter in weight; less storage space; and lower center of gravity.|$|E

50|$|In the Davy {{system a}} gauze {{surrounds}} the flame and extends for a distance above forming a cage. All except the very earliest Davy lamps {{have a double}} layer {{at the top of}} the cage. Rising hot gases are cooled by the gauze, the metal conducting the heat away and being itself cooled by the incoming air. There is no restriction on the air entering the lamp and so if firedamp is entrained it will burn within the lamp itself. Indeed, the lamp burns brighter in dangerous atmospheres thus acting as a warning to miners of rising firedamp levels. The Clanny configuration uses a <b>short</b> <b>glass</b> section around the flame with a gauze cylinder above it. Air is drawn in and descends just inside the glass, passing up through the flame in the centre of the lamp.|$|E
5000|$|... tert-Butyllithium is a {{pyrophoric}} substance, {{meaning that}} it easily catches fire on exposure to air. (A precise definition of a pyrophoric material is one [...] "that ignites spontaneously in air at or below 54.55 °C (130.19 °F)".) The solvents used in common commercial preparations are themselves flammable. While {{it is possible to}} work with this compound using cannula transfer, traces of tert-butyllithium {{at the tip of the}} needle or cannula may catch fire and clog the cannula with lithium salts. While some researchers take this [...] "pilot light" [...] effect as a sign that the product is [...] "fresh" [...] and has not degraded due to time or improper storage/handling, some workers prefer to enclose the needle tip or cannula in a <b>short</b> <b>glass</b> tube, which is flushed with an inert gas and sealed at each end with septa. Serious laboratory accidents involving tert-butyllithium have occurred.

As {{a graduate student at}} NYU, Alben worked with Jun Zhang and Michael Shelley in investigating the dynamics of flexible structures and how such structures can become more aerodynamic by altering their shape. In this study, experiments visualized a <b>short</b> <b>glass</b> fiber deforming in fluid flow, and analysis showed how the fiber can reduce the drag force exerted by the fluid by changing its shape. This work was published 2002 in Nature under the title Drag Reduction Through Self-Similar Bending of a Flexible Body, and was the subject of various news articles in periodicals including The New York Times and others.. As a Postdoctoral Fellow at Harvard, Alben collaborated with Ernst A. van Nierop and Michael P. Brenner in a paper titled [...] "How Bumps on Whale Flippers Delay Stall: An Aerodynamic Model".. The paper gave a mathematical model for this hydrodynamic phenomenon. This result, featured in MIT's Technology Review and Nature, provides a theoretical basis for potential improvements in using bumps for more stable airplanes, more agile submarines, and more efficient turbine blades. In 2007, Alben investigated (with Michael P. Brenner) the self-assembly of a 3D structures from flat, elastic sheets. This experiment, featured on New Scientist, presented a new technique in nano construction; previously, the transformation of flat sheets to 3D structures were performed by random formation, but in this study, the addition of biases into the design of the sheets gave the possibility of predicting the resulting shape.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify whether the <b>short</b> <b>glass</b> fibers of CaO-P 2 O 5 -SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 (CPSA) glass possessed the ability to {{reinforce}} conventional glass-ionomer cement (GIC). Biocompatibility of the set GIC mixed with short CPSA glass fibers was evaluated in a cell culture cytotoxicity test. Moreover, the rate of release fluoride ions from GIC mixed with <b>short</b> <b>glass</b> fibers was measured. The powder of a conventional GIC was mixed with short CPSA glass fibers (diameter, 9. 7 ± 2. 1 μm; aspect ratio, 5. 0 ± 0. 9) before mixing with the liquid of the GIC. Set cements of 40 mass% short CPSA glass fibers mixed with GIC powders showed maximum values of 18 MPa in diametral tensile strength (DTS) after aging for 24 hours due to the effects of specific shape of <b>short</b> <b>glass</b> fibers and reactivity between the mixing liquid and <b>short</b> <b>glass</b> fibers. The cytotoxicity of these cements to rat pulpal cells tested by cellular activity showed that the set GIC disks (13 mm in dia. × 1 mm in thickness) with 40 mass% short CPSA glass fibers had cell activity as that of the set GIC or a cell culture coverslip used as control. Moreover, the addition of <b>short</b> <b>glass</b> fibers to GIC did not disturb the release of fluoride from the specimens...|$|E
40|$|Mechanical and {{dry sliding}} wear {{characterization}} of <b>short</b> <b>glass</b> fiber reinforced polyester-based homogeneous and their functionally graded composite materials Siddhartha and Akant Kumar Singh In this research work, <b>short</b> <b>glass</b> fiber {{has been used}} to fabricate polyester-based homogeneous composites and their functionally graded material. Vertical centrifugal casting technique and simple mechanical stirring is used for fabricating functionally graded materials and homogeneous composites, respectytively. Wear tests are conducted over a range of sliding velocities (1. 57 – 3. 66 m/s), normal load (10 – 30 N), fiber contents (0 – 6 wt%), and sliding distances (1 – 3 km). Friction and wear characteristics of developed materials are successfully analyzed using Taguchi design of experiment scheme and analysis of variance (ANOVA). Artificial neural network approach is also applied to the friction and wear data for subsequent validation. Out of all samples fabricated it is found that 6 wt % <b>short</b> <b>glass</b> fiber polyester-based functionally graded materials exhibit lowest specific wear rate. Additions of <b>short</b> <b>glass</b> fiber in polyester-based functionally graded materials have an incisive effect on tensile and flexural strength in comparison to homogeneous composites.
