The Chinese ladao process is dated to the 10th century; other traditional techniques include tie-dye, batik, Rōketsuzome, katazome, bandhani and leheria.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) is {{the main}} target pest of Bt corn technologies, such as YieldGard VT PRO(tm) (Cry 1 A. 105 /Cry 2 Ab 2) and PowerCore(tm) (Cry 1 A. 105 /Cry 2 Ab 2 /Cry 1 F). In this study, it was {{evaluated}} the biological activity of Bt proteins expressed in different plant structures of YieldGard VT PRO(tm) and PowerCore(tm) corn against S. frugiperda. Complete mortality of S. frugiperda neonates was observed on leaf-disc of both Bt corn technologies. However, the mortality in <b>silks</b> <b>and</b> grains was lower than 50 and 6 %, respectively. In addition, more than 49 % of the surviving larvae in <b>silks</b> <b>and</b> grains completed the biological cycle. However, all life table parameters were negatively affected in insects that developed in <b>silks</b> <b>and</b> grains of both Bt corn events. In summary, the low biological activity of Bt proteins expressed on <b>silks</b> <b>and</b> grains of YieldGard VT PRO(tm) and PowerCore(tm) corn {{can contribute to the}} resistance evolution in S. frugiperda populations...|$|R
