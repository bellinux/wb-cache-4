The original motivation {{to carry out this}} project was to see what <b>social</b> <b>accounts</b> would look like and whether it was possible to develop them in this organisation. The experience of doing <b>social</b> <b>accounts</b> is further examined using Gray, et al., (1997) to explore whether these were either ‘ideal’ or ‘good’ <b>social</b> <b>accounts</b> for the organisation. A communitarian philosophical framework is used in order to examine the conceptualisation of ‘good’ <b>social</b> <b>accounts.</b> The first part of the thesis explores the <b>social</b> and environmental <b>accounting</b> (SEA) and accountability literature, with the second part exploring the experience of reaching initial agreement to do <b>social</b> <b>accounts</b> (SAs). The agreement to do the accounts was then followed by two years of <b>social</b> <b>accounts</b> developed with JSP. This empirical data provides a detailed account from the perspectives of insiders and other sources as to the experience of doing <b>social</b> <b>accounts.</b> This experience is then opened up to interrogation from a wider view point. The third part of the thesis examines the experience of JSP using third sector communitarian philosophy and a voluntary accountability framework in order to demonstrate that JSP could provide an example of a ‘good’ or ‘ideal’ <b>social</b> <b>account.</b> This raises the {{issue of whether or not}} ‘good’ or ‘ideal’ <b>social</b> <b>accounts</b> for third sector organisations are only possible within a communitarian paradigm. If it is possible to establish what ‘good’ <b>social</b> <b>accounts</b> entail then it may be appropriate to extend this approach to other contexts, for example, the public sector or the corporate world...|$|R

40|$|During {{organisational}} change, managers use <b>social</b> <b>accounts</b> {{to influence}} the behaviour of organisational members. <b>Social</b> <b>accounts</b> are a specific form of communication. They are explanations of organisational actions (Bies, 1987; Cobb & Wooten, 1998; Shaw, Wild, & Colquitt, 2003). The term refers to an explanation where the account giver aims {{to influence the}} receiver?s affective or behavioural reactions, often to mitigate reactions to negative outcomes (Bies, 1987; De Cremer, van Dijk, & Pilluda, 2010). Hence, <b>social</b> <b>accounts</b> are useful in creating support for change in affecting the sense people make of a particular situation. <b>Social</b> <b>accounts</b> are effective in manipulating individual perceptions of decisions and change responses (Cobb & Wooten, 1998; Shaw et al., 2003; Tucker, Yeow, & Viki, 2013). Significant research has studied this relationship (Bies, 1987; Cobb & Wooten, 1998; Frey & Cobb, 2010) but theory is less developed {{in the process of}} how <b>social</b> <b>accounts</b> get taken up, specifically; the recipient?s role in uptake. During change, both top-down and bottom-up processes influence organisational members understandings and employees themselves {{play a significant role in}} filling in gaps in information with their own expectations (Rousseau & Tijoriwala, 1999). Organisational members actively interpret information and influence the development of schema and the behaviour of peers (Balogun & Johnson, 2004; Maitlis & Sonenshein, 2010; Rouleau, 2005). Key to understanding this issue is when the influence of deliberately given <b>social</b> <b>accounts</b> leads to behaviour change (or not). During change, employees are continually given information and suggestions about why events have occurred. Sometimes intended recipients do not register this information; they choose to attend to one piece of information over another; and only then is information subsequently given meaning and acted upon (Ginsberg & Venkatraman, 1995). In this paper, we first describe the processes when organisational members receive <b>social</b> <b>accounts</b> and then we formulate an explanation of why some accounts influence change behaviour whilst others do not. By understanding this process we advance <b>social</b> <b>accounts</b> literature, exploring the currently neglected role of the recipient in <b>social</b> <b>account</b> uptake. This, in turn advances our understanding of variation in the influence generated by <b>social</b> <b>accounts</b> and their effective use. <b>Social</b> <b>accounts</b> literature is criticised for its neglect of contextual factors (Frey & Cobb, 2010; Tucker et al., 2013). This is especially the case when discussing the behaviour of organisational members in context sensitive situations. Traditionally, <b>social</b> <b>accounts</b> research comes from a positivist tradition, with little consideration of context, for example how the organisational landscape might influence the account receiver. Instead research has focused on refining the design and delivery of accounts to maximise their likelihood of influencing behaviour (Cobb & Wooten, 1998; De Cremer et al., 2010; Frey & Cobb, 2010), but this focus is either the content of the account or the attributes of the account giver. The importance of account-giving in organisational change highlights that change represents a complex situation here numerous, often conflicting, explanations create challenges (Cobb & Wooten, 1998) but again little direct research asks how contextual influences affect the process of accommodating one account over another. In this paper we explore this process, taking a cognitivist and an interpretivist approach to understanding context. We draw on influences from information processing and sensemaking to highlight how the interplay between context and cognition explains why some <b>social</b> <b>accounts</b> lead to changes in understanding whilst others do not. We propose that <b>social</b> <b>accounts</b> must be relevant in order to navigate perceptual filters; must demonstrate imperative for action, in order to attract the attention of account receivers; and must be credible within their immediate context to demonstrate value...|$|R
40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>accounts</b> are a {{powerful}} tool in influencing the behavior of organizational members during major change. Examination of their effectiveness has largely focused {{on the design of}} accounts to influence behavioral and affective responses. However, when used in real life practice, more individualized, interpretive and agentic responses to <b>social</b> <b>accounts</b> have been found to influence effectiveness. Using an example of large-scale organizational change, moving from one hospital facility to another, we explore the dynamic and contextual interpretation of <b>social</b> <b>accounts</b> over time. Our findings expand <b>social</b> <b>account</b> theory by examining how potentially successful change communications are derailed by the relevance of the account in relation to an individual's past, by the individuals' ability to express agency and by temporality; how over time, lived experience can alter the perceived truthfulness of an account and alter its potency...|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} {{which type}} of <b>social</b> <b>account</b> (denying responsibility versus apologizing) following an unfair offer makes recipients more likely to accept the offer in ultimatum bargaining. We identified stress responses to uncertainty as an individual difference factor that should moderate the relative effectiveness of these <b>social</b> <b>accounts.</b> A denial should make acceptance of an unfair offer more likely among recipients who respond to uncertainty with low stress. An apology should make such acceptance more likely among recipients who respond with high stress. Further, we argued that this cross-over interaction should be observed particularly among recipients interacting with a high power allocator. Two ultimatum bargaining experiments supported these ideas. Employing the perspective of victims of unfairness, the present research identifies a relevant individual difference moderator {{of the effectiveness of}} <b>social</b> <b>accounts</b> in bargaining situations and identifies power as a situational variable that promotes the expression of this factor.
