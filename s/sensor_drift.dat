40|$|<b>Sensor</b> <b>drift</b> {{and noise}} {{handling}} in electronic noses (E-noses) {{are two different}} challenging problems. Sensor noise is caused by many factors such as temperature, pressure, humidity and cross interference. Noise can occur at any time, producing irrelevant or meaningless data. On the other hand, drift is appeared as a long term signal variation caused by unknown dynamic physical and chemical complex processes. Because <b>sensor</b> <b>drift</b> is not purely deterministic, it is very hard, if not impossible, to distinguish it from noise and vice versa.

40|$|Modern {{power plants}} are all {{strongly}} dependent on reliable and accurate sensor readings for monitoring and control, thus making sensors {{an important part}} of any plant. Failing sensors can force a plant or component into non-optimal operation, cause complete shut-down of operation or in the worst case result in damage to components. Given their importance, sensors need regular calibration and maintenance, a time-consuming and therefore costly process. In this paper a method is presented for evaluating sensor accuracy which aims to minimize the need for calibration {{and at the same time}} avoid shut-downs due to sensor faults etc. The proposed method is based on training artificial neural networks as classifiers to recognize <b>sensor</b> <b>drifts.</b> The method is evaluated on two types of gas turbines, i. e., one single-shaft and one twin-shaft machine. The results show the method is capable of early detection of <b>sensor</b> <b>drifts</b> for both types of machines as well as accurate production of soft measurements.

In the current study, a VR environment was designed to guide participants to perform prescribed neck movements. The cervical spine kinematics was measured by both the Rift and a reference motion tracking system. Comparison of the kinematics data between the Rift and the tracking system indicated that the Rift can provide good estimates on full range of motion (from {{one side to the other}} side) during the performed task.

40|$|Currently {{available}} flexible fuel vehicles (FFVs {{can operate}} on a blend of gasoline and ethanol in any concentration of up to 85 % ethanol (93 % in Brazil). Accurate estimation of ethanol content is important to cope with potential problems caused by fuel variability. This thesis provides the first-ever comprehensive collection of models, model-based analysis and control design for ethanol estimation in FFVs. The common practice in ethanol content estimation exploits the differences in stoichiometric air-to-fuel ratios (SAFR) between gasoline and ethanol. In this approach, the online identification of SAFR depends on air and fuel metering during the closed-loop regulation of air-to-fuel ratio (AFR) to the stoichiometric value via the feedback of the exhaust gas oxygen sensor (EGO) measurement. In this thesis, first, we develop a simple phenomenological model of the AFR control process and a simple ethanol estimation law which represents the currently practiced system in FFVs. We then show that the SAFR-based ethanol estimation is sensitive to mass air flow (MAF) <b>sensor</b> <b>drifts</b> and/or fuel injector drifts. A physics-based control-oriented model for fuel puddle dynamics in port fuel injection (PFI) FFVs is then proposed. The transient fuel compensation (TFC) derived from this model allows faster ethanol estimation and improved AFR control. Since the conventional SAFR-based ethanol content estimation is sensitive to MAF sensor error, a method to correct MAF sensor error is next proposed. The correction is realized by using additional measurements of the intake manifold pressure to prevent mis-estimation of ethanol content during MAF <b>sensor</b> <b>drifts.</b> Finally, an integrated estimation scheme in direct injection (DI) FFVs is formulated. This process is able to estimate not only ethanol content but also fuel injector drift. Further, it exploits the difference in latent heat of vaporization (LHV) between gasoline and ethanol by using in-cylinder pressure measurements in addition to conventional SAFR-based estimation. The proposed algorithm and the associated parameter tuning method take the data-driven model errors into account. Feasibility of the integrated estimation scheme is validated by simulations and engine dynamometer tests...|$|R
