40|$|LTPD {{sampling}} plans minimizing the mean inspection cost per lot of pro-cess average quality when {{the remainder of}} rejected lots is inspected were originally designed <b>for</b> the <b>inspection</b> by attributes. The single {{sampling plans}} <b>for</b> the <b>inspection</b> by variables and <b>for</b> the <b>inspection</b> by variables and attributes (all items from the sample are inspected by variables, remainder of rejected lots is inspected by attributes) were then proposed. Under the same protection of consumer the LTPD plans <b>for</b> <b>inspection</b> by variables are in many situations more economical than the corresponding sampling plans <b>for</b> <b>inspection</b> by attributes. Comparative efficiency of sampling plan <b>for</b> <b>inspection</b> by variables and attributes can be assessed using a measure which has been proposed for this purpose...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{concerns}} the acceptance sampling plans when {{the remainder of}} rejected lots is inspected. Two types of AOQL plans are considered – <b>for</b> <b>inspection</b> by variables and <b>for</b> <b>inspection</b> by variables and attributes (all items from the sample are inspected by variables, the remainder of rejected lots is inspected by attributes). These plans are compared with the corresponding Dodge–Romig AOQL plans <b>for</b> <b>inspection</b> by attributes. An algorithm allowing the calculation of these plans (with the use of software Mathematica) was presented. From the results of numerical investigations it follows that under the same protection of consumer the AOQL plans <b>for</b> <b>inspection</b> by variables areAOQL, sampling plans, acceptance plan, economical aspects, software Mathematica...|$|R

5000|$|Ep5 - Environmental Ambience Stable, Wish You Were Here: Luna {{is feeling}} bored, and Andy proposes going on holiday. To do this the group {{need to get}} travel permits from 80H, but he is {{only too happy to}} provide them, since the Assistant Galactic Coordinator is visiting the <b>sector</b> <b>for</b> a random <b>inspection</b> and he is {{concerned}} he would find their habiviron [...] "inefficient". They arrange their plans, but 80H learns that the Coordinator will be visiting earlier than expected, and therefore gives the group permits for the earlier time, leaving their bookings unusable and no time to make earlier ones. Gramps suggests that they could go camping instead, and Brat produces a model VW Beetle which can be converted into a full-size car for them to drive in. Unfortunately, they then find that Jazzmin has no travel permit, and 80H cannot get her one, since technically she is not permitted to be in the habiviron at all. 40D agrees to substitute one of hers, and the group prepares to leave, only to find that car does not work; Brat had no idea that cars needed petrol, which is no longer available. As a last resort, the group decide to camp inside the Habiviron. The Assistant Coordinator arrives in the habiviron as part of his random inspection, and 80H nearly passes out when he sees what's going on, but in fact he's happy to join in.|$|R
