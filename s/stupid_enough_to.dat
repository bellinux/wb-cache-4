25|$|Sephy, {{living with}} Callum's mother, Meggie, becomes {{increasingly}} fond of her daughter, Callie Rose. Callum's guard, Jack, delivers a letter, written by Callum before he died, {{saying that he}} never loved her and {{could not believe that}} she was <b>stupid</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> fall for him. Meggie tries to make Sephy believe that Callum was forced to write the letter {{by the rest of the}} gang, but the letter is so hurtful that Sephy believes it and becomes full of postnatal depression. She meets Jaxon, a hot-tempered man with a band, the Midges. He offers Sephy a singing part, but the noughts are prejudiced against her because she is a cross. She begins to neglect Callie Rose.|$|E
25|$|By February 1920 Wilson's Staff {{wanted to}} reduce {{commitment}} to Mesopotamia (modern Iraq), despite inevitable loss of prestige, as {{occupation of the}} whole country was not necessary to safeguard the southern Persian oilfields. In May 1920 Wilson submitted a joint paper with Churchill and Trenchard (Chief of Air Staff) complaining {{about the cost of}} keeping 10,000 British and 50,000 Indian troops there. When revolt broke out in Mesopotamia, Wilson asked (15 July 1920) to pull out of Persia to send reinforcements (he also needed troops for Ireland and the UK), but Lloyd George said that Curzon “would not stand it”. By October 1920 the local British commander Sir Aylmer Haldane managed to restore order but on 10 December Wilson minuted his agreement to an appraisal by the Director of Military Operations that “we ran things too fine and that a great disaster was only narrowly avoided”. Wilson was privately scathing about what he called “Hot Air, Aeroplanes & Arabs” – Trenchard's plan for Air Defence backed by Arab levies, announced by Churchill at the Cairo Conference in July 1921 – although glad at the reduction in military commitment, and wrote to Rawlinson that when trouble came Churchill would “hop into an aeroplane and fly away, waving Ta-Ta to any poor bloody native who is <b>stupid</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> back us”.|$|E
500|$|After Alley was {{retired from}} the presidency, he was purged from combat {{in the army and}} was {{assigned}} the new post of military attaché in Washington, D.C, an appointment he refused to accept. General Etienne Eyadema, the president of neighboring Togo, thought that this [...] "serve right, for being <b>stupid</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> give power back to the politicians. Don't think I'm ever going to be that dumb." [...] Alley was discharged from the armed forces altogether in September, with Kouandété taking his place as Chief of Staff.|$|E

25|$|The Bistromath arrives {{too late}} {{at the gate}} to stop the robots, so its {{occupants}} transport to the planet to attempt {{to negotiate with the}} Krikkit people. To their surprise, they find that the people seem to lack any desire to continue the war, and are directed to the robot and spaceship facilities in orbit about the planet. With Zaphod and Marvin's help, the group is able to infiltrate the facilities. Trillian deduces that the Krikkiters have been manipulated, reasoning that the people of Krikkit could not simultaneously be smart <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> develop their ultimate weapon—a bomb that could destroy every star in the universe—while also being <b>stupid</b> <b>enough</b> not <b>to</b> realise that this weapon would also destroy them.|$|R
500|$|Slovenian Marxist {{philosopher and}} {{cultural}} critic Slavoj Žižek has incorporated the film into {{his critique of}} ideology by describing it as [...] "reactionary," [...] interpreting the king's stutter as evidence that he [...] "displays a minimum of common sense, experiencing the stupidity of seriously accepting that one is king by divine will" [...] and claiming that [...] "the task of the Australian voice-coach is to render him <b>stupid</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> accept his being a king as his natural property." [...] Žižek thus interprets the king's stutter as a case of what is referred to in Lacanian psychoanalysis as [...] "symbolic castration." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{consulting}} with his lawyers in October 2005, Stollery {{responded to the}} Church with a far more aggressive stance. Now believing the accusation to be completely frivolous, Stollery publicly refused, challenging the Church with: [...] "I'm keeping my domain, see you in court." [...] Again {{in an interview with}} ONE News, Stollery reiterated {{that he was going to}} retain rights to [...] "ScienTOMogy", and not transfer the URL to the Church of Scientology, as they had requested. After the media attention, Stollery said he began to receive [...] "annoying calls" [...] from local Scientologists. [...] "The first few I was <b>stupid</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> answer, but now they just call and call and call. When I did speak to 'a church member here in Auckland' he kept insisting over and over that we meet to talk about my 'vendetta' with the church." ...|$|E
500|$|Comedian Richard Jeni {{performed}} a popular stand-up routine {{based on the}} film. During his routine, Jeni suggested that {{the title of the}} film should have been [...] "Here's a Fish, You're Stupid" [...] instead of the official title (Jaws 4: The Revenge) and called the film itself, [...] "A movie so stupid... You couldn't be <b>stupid</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> enjoy it". Jeni also poked fun at several moments in the film, including Ellen's decision to leave Long Island and go to The Bahamas ("You with me here? An ideal place to avoid a fish [...] " [...] and [...] "Wouldn't an apartment building be sufficient protection?"), her affair with Hoagie right after three of her family members had been killed by the shark ("Ghee whizz, three people in my family have been eaten by a shark in one week... GEEZ AM I HORNY!") and how the shark reached The Bahamas before Ellen & Hoagie ("They land; there he [...] is, couple of beers, Ray-Bans.").|$|E

50|$|Hactar's {{particulate}} form wrapped {{itself around}} the idyllic planet Krikkit, isolating {{it from the}} rest of the universe, and gradually re-engineered its society until they could recreate the bomb and fulfill Hactar's program. The Krikkiters were defeated in the Krikkit Wars, racial memories of which would lead to the invention of the game cricket on Earth. Billions of years later, they built Hactar's flawed bomb and tried to deploy it, leading to their discovery of the computer's influence on their evolution. Trillian noted that it was impossible for the Krikkiters <b>to</b> be smart <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> build this weapon on their own, yet <b>stupid</b> <b>enough</b> not <b>to</b> grasp that it would destroy them if they used it. Hactar created a fully functional duplicate of the bomb and hid it in a travel bag belonging to Arthur Dent, who very nearly caused it to explode before stopping it by accident at the last second.|$|R
50|$|Personal {{differences}} led to {{the replacement}} of Marc Hebden on drums. Paul Daley (later to form Leftfield and top the British charts), a schoolfriend of Paul Leinster, joined. The band {{indicated that they had}} 'plans to release a golden oldie for a follow-up' to their first single. Another studio session, in 1980, produced 'Here Comes the Night', partnered by 'Both Sides' as the B-side. Edwards suggested that the Rivals cover the song after hearing it on David Bowie's Pin Ups. 'Being <b>stupid</b> <b>enough</b> not <b>to</b> realise it wasn’t even Bowie’s song', that it was a Them song, the band produced a blistering, punked-up version of the bluesy hit. The record received airplay from Paul Burnett, Mike Read, and John Peel, the last of whom played the original and the Rivals' version back-to-back {{at the end of one}} of his programmes to show how superior he thought the Ramsgate lads' take was.|$|R
500|$|... "Exit Through the Kwik-E-Mart" [...] {{was written}} by Marc Wilmore and {{directed}} by Steven Dean Moore {{as part of the}} twenty-third season of The Simpsons (2011–12). It spoofs the debated status of street art as a true form of art. The title is a reference to Exit Through the Gift Shop, a 2010 street art documentary by graffiti artist Banksy who produced the opening sequence of an earlier Simpsons episode titled [...] "MoneyBART" [...] (2010). The Richard Hawley song [...] "Tonight The Streets Are Ours", which is the theme song of Exit Through the Gift Shop, is included in the episode during a montage of Bart painting graffiti in Springfield. Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club noted in his review of [...] "Exit Through the Kwik-E-Mart" [...] that the [...] "reveal that the art show was a police sting gives the show a moment to joke about the anti-art market theme from Exit Through The Gift Shop. Wiggum asks who would be <b>stupid</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> pay for work that an amateur puts up for free in public, and the answer is, as in Banksy’s movie, the very wealthy, here represented by Mr. Burns." ...|$|E
500|$|Returning to the West End, Gielgud {{starred in}} JBPriestley's The Good Companions, adapted {{for the stage}} by the author and Edward Knoblock. The {{production}} ran from May 1931 for 331 performances, and Gielgud described it as his first real taste of commercial success. He played Inigo Jollifant, a young schoolmaster who abandons teaching to join a travelling theatre troupe. This crowd-pleaser drew disapproval from the more austere reviewers, who felt Gielgud should be doing something more demanding, but he found playing a conventional juvenile lead had challenges of its own and helped him improve his technique. During {{the run of the}} play he made another film, Insult (1932), a melodrama about the French Foreign Legion, and he starred in a cinema version of The Good Companions in 1933, with Jessie Matthews. A letter to a friend reveals Gielgud's view of film acting: [...] "There is talk of my doing Inigo in the film of The Good Companions, which appals my soul but appeals to my pocket." [...] In his first volume of memoirs, published in 1939, Gielgud devoted two pages to describing the things about filming that he detested. Unlike his contemporaries Richardson and Laurence Olivier, he made few films until after the Second World War, and did not establish himself as a prominent film actor until many years after that. As he put it in 1994, [...] "I was <b>stupid</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> toss my head and stick to the stage while watching Larry and Ralph sign lucrative Korda contracts." ...|$|E
500|$|During his childhood, and {{owing to}} his {{considerable}} strength and bulk, Steiger {{became known as}} [...] "The Rock". Despite being mocked over his mother's alcoholism, he was a popular figure at school and an able softball player. He displayed an interest in writing poetry and acting during his adolescent years, and appeared in several school plays while at West Side High School in Newark. Tired of fighting with his mother, he {{ran away from home}} at age sixteen to join the United States Navy during World War II. [...] He enlisted on May 11, 1942, and received his training at the U.S. Naval Training Station in Newport, Rhode Island. He joined the newly commissioned USS Taussig (DD-746) on May 20, 1944. While serving as a torpedoman on destroyers, he saw action in the South Pacific, including the Battle of Iwo Jima. Steiger later commented: [...] "I loved the Navy. I was <b>stupid</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> think I was being heroic". His experiences during the war haunted him {{for the rest of his}} life, particularly the loss of Americans during the Battle of Iwo Jima, as well as the sinking of vessels by the Taussig which were known to have women and children aboard. On December 17, 1944, off the coast of Luzon in the Philippines, Steiger and the Taussig encountered a severe typhoon, which became known as Halsey's Typhoon, with winds reaching one hundred knots (115mph) and [...] waves. As a result, three U.S. destroyers were lost, but the Taussig survived, with Steiger tying a rope to himself on deck and flattening himself as waves engulfed the ship.|$|E

6000|$|Lord Rosebery {{could not}} now step up without {{stepping}} into the premiership. His humor, which is his most obvious faculty, has been a prop to him many a time ere now, but, if I was his adviser, I should tell him that it has served its purpose. There are a great many excellent people who shake their heads over it in {{a man who has}} become a power in the land. [...] "Let us be grave," [...] said Dr. Johnson once to a merry companion, [...] "for here comes a fool." [...] In an unknown novel there is a character who says of himself that [...] "he is not <b>stupid</b> <b>enough</b> ever <b>to</b> be a great man." [...] I happen to know that this reflection was evolved by the author out of thinking over Lord Rosebery. It is not easy for a bright man to be heavy, and Lord Rosebery's humor is so spontaneous that if a joke is made in their company he has always finished laughing before Lord Hartington begins. Perhaps when Lord Rosebery is on the point of letting his humor run off with him in a public speech, he could recover his solemnity by thinking of the Examiner.|$|R

6000|$|Proud of his dreary paradoxes, Warburton scorned {{the humble}} office of {{furnishing}} useful information. Pope had said, in his Imitations of Horace, that because three ladies liked a luckless play, a spendthrift {{had taken the}} whole house upon the poet's night,[8] which drew from Warburton the following note:--"The common reader, I am sensible, will be always more solicitous about the names of these three ladies, the unlucky play, and every other circumstance that attended this piece of gallantry, than for the explanation of our author's sense, or the illustration of his poetry, even where he is most moral and sublime. But had it been in Mr. Pope's purpose to indulge so impertinent a curiosity, he had sought elsewhere for a commentator on his writings. Which defect in these notes, the periodical scribblers, however, have been <b>stupid</b> and shameless <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> object to them."[9] Warburton's reserve was praiseworthy when his motive was respect for private feelings. His general neglect to clear up the allusions in Pope's poems did not admit of this apology, and in default of a better defence he called his critics [...] "stupid and shameless." [...] His habit when reasons failed him was to supply their place with abuse.|$|R
