5|$|Most of NY37B west of Massena {{ran through}} a low-lying area along the <b>St.</b> <b>Lawrence</b> River. In 1958, {{this area was}} {{permanently}} indundated {{as part of the}} <b>St.</b> <b>Lawrence</b> Seaway's construction. As a result, NY37B was rerouted to follow a new roadway along the fringe of Lake <b>St.</b> <b>Lawrence</b> to meet NY37 in Louisville Corner. A connector between NY37 and NY37B in Louisville was designated as NY131 by 1960. The alignments of NY37B and NY131 west of Massena were swapped , placing NY37B on its modern alignment.|$|E
5|$|Victoria Bridge {{was built}} as a one-track tubular bridge which opened in 1860. It was the first bridge to cross the <b>St.</b> <b>Lawrence</b> River, and the longest bridge in the world. It was re{{built as a}} two-track truss bridge in 1898. The South Y {{approach}} was rebuilt around the Saint-Lambert locks of the <b>St.</b> <b>Lawrence</b> Seaway in 1961.|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of the summer, Wolfe's focus changed, possibly due to frustration with Montcalm's tactics. Wolfe's troops, along with American Rangers, attacked and destroyed small French settlements along the <b>St.</b> <b>Lawrence.</b> An estimated 1,400 stone houses and manors were destroyed, and many colonists killed. The effort was likely an attempt to force Montcalm's army out of its fortifications, but was unsuccessful. However, the attacks did reduce the amount of supplies available to the French, especially as the British navy, unable to control the <b>St.</b> <b>Lawrence</b> entirely, was successfully blockading the ports in France.|$|E
50|$|The Bodmin Community Hospital and the Bodmin Treatment Centre (run by Ramsay Health Care UK) {{were both}} built within {{the grounds of}} the <b>St.</b> <b>Lawrence's</b> Hospital after it was closed in 2002. <b>St.</b> <b>Lawrence’s</b> Hospital, (demolished in 2014) was a {{psychiatric}} hospital.|$|R

5|$|In the 1950s, {{construction}} {{began on}} the <b>St.</b> <b>Lawrence</b> Seaway, a system of canals and locks {{that would make the}} <b>St.</b> <b>Lawrence</b> River suitable for shipping. As part of the seaway's construction, a low-lying area in Ontario and New York between Waddington, New York, and Cornwall, Ontario, would be inundated with water {{in order to create a}} navigable channel through the Long Sault rapids and to allow hydroelectric stations to be established immediately upriver from Massena and Cornwall. Much of NY37B was located within the flood-prone region due to its proximity to the river. On July1, 1958, the intentional flooding was carried out via the destruction of a cofferdam upstream, creating what is now known as Lake <b>St.</b> <b>Lawrence</b> and inundating the majority of NY37B west of Massena.|$|E
5|$|New York State Route420 (NY420) is a north–south {{state highway}} in <b>St.</b> <b>Lawrence</b> County, New York, in the United States. The {{southern}} terminus {{of the route}} is at an intersection with U.S. Route11 (US11) {{in the town of}} Stockholm. Its northern terminus is at a junction with NY37 in the village of Massena. NY420 passes through undeveloped regions of <b>St.</b> <b>Lawrence</b> County for most of its routing and briefly overlaps with NY11C in the hamlet of Winthrop.|$|E

5|$|During {{the peak}} {{popularity}} of the breed, three main types could be distinguished. All three are now considered extinct, having disappeared or been merged back into the main Canadian horse population. The first, the Canadian Heavy Draft or <b>St.</b> <b>Lawrence,</b> which disappeared by the late 1700s, probably developed from Shire and Clydesdale crosses. They were probably a popular export to New England, which bred large numbers of horses for Caribbean plantations. The second, the Frencher, sometimes also called the <b>St.</b> <b>Lawrence,</b> was a trotting horse known for its power and speed, resulting from crosses with Thoroughbreds. Mixed with French trotting lines, they {{played a role in}} the development of the US trotting horses.|$|E
50|$|On {{the west}} side of the village there are two churches, <b>St.</b> <b>Lawrence's</b> Church and Hambleton Evangelical Church. <b>St</b> <b>Lawrence's</b> was rebuilt in 1896 with {{registers}} dating to 1706 and is a Grade II listed building. In 1838, a Methodist Chapel was built, but no longer functions as such.|$|R

5|$|Hundreds {{of people}} {{worked in the}} {{wreckage}} all day and into the night {{in an effort to}} find and rescue any children pinned underneath. Area contractors had sent all their men to assist, and many other people came to the scene in response to the pleas for help. Eventually, 34 firefighters and the Chief of the Lansing Fire Department arrived on the scene, as did several Michigan State Police officers who managed traffic to and from the scene. The injured and dying were transported to Sparrow Hospital and <b>St.</b> <b>Lawrence</b> Hospital in Lansing. The construction of the <b>St.</b> <b>Lawrence</b> facility had been financed in large part by Lawrence Price, Nellie Kehoe's uncle and formerly an executive in charge of Oldsmobile's Lansing Car Assembly.|$|E

5|$|The ML fleet {{was joined}} by two new smaller 5,600 grt vessels, the Manchester Port and Manchester Merchant during 1899 and 1900, and further new vessels {{followed}} quickly thereafter.

5|$|The {{section of}} Honoré-Mercier bridge {{spanning}} over the <b>St.</b> <b>Lawrence</b> Seaway was rebuilt to seaway {{standards in the}} 1950s. The bridge was twinned by an identical one, on the downriver side, which opened in 1963.|$|E
5|$|When NY812 {{was first}} assigned, it was locally {{maintained}} from NY126 in Croghan to NY3 in Diana and from NY3 in Pitcairn to NY58 in Fowler. The {{section of the}} route between NY126 and the Croghan village line was maintained by the village of Croghan; however, {{the rest of the}} two locally maintained sections were maintained by Lewis and <b>St.</b> <b>Lawrence</b> counties. Most of the Lewis County-owned section was co-designated as CR11; however, the short piece between the Croghan village line and Belfort Road was part of CR10. In <b>St.</b> <b>Lawrence</b> County, NY812 was overlaid on the existing CR73 from NY3 to Stone Road, CR99 between Stone Road and Balmat, and CR56 from Balmat to Fowler. The state of New York assumed ownership and maintenance of NY812 between Croghan and Diana on April1, 1980, as part of a highway maintenance swap between the state and Lewis County that transferred NY194 to the county. Ownership of NY812 from Pitcairn to Fowler was transferred to the state on September1, 1982, as part of a highway maintenance swap between the state and <b>St.</b> <b>Lawrence</b> County.|$|E
