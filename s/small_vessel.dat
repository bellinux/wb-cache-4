5|$|The {{player is}} free to join {{any one of the}} servile groups and share common goals, or remain unaligned. Geneforge can be {{completed}} without joining any group. Trajkov can be killed through combat or tricked into killing himself by using the Geneforge. He can also be aided in activating the device, if the player steals the shaper gloves from Goettsch. Goettsch offers the player fake shaper gauntlets, which do not protect Trajkov from the Geneforge's energy should he be convinced they are genuine shaping gloves. The player can complete the game by using the last boat on Sucia Island. The <b>small</b> <b>vessel</b> is moored in a guarded dock {{on the far side of}} the island. Finishing the game unlocks one of more than a dozen game endings, dependent on the player's actions during the game.|$|E

5|$|Dividing the {{captured}} British sailors, Lejoille transferred half to Généreux and left half on Leander with a French prize crew under Louis Gabriel Deniéport. In direct contravention {{of the established}} conventions of war, both sets of prisoners were immediately ordered to effect repairs to the vessels. Only once both ships were ready for the journey to Corfu were the prisoners given bread and water, although the wounded were still denied medical attention. For ten days after the engagement the battered ships sailed northwards against the wind, Généreux forced to attach a tow to Leander to avoid leaving the prize behind. On 28 August, a sail appeared to the south. Panic broke out on Généreux, and Lejoille ordered the prisoners confined below and for preparations {{to be made to}} abandon Leander and make all speed for Corfu. The new arrival was in fact the 16-gun British sloop HMS Mutine under Lieutenant Thomas Bladen Capel, carrying the second copies of Nelson's despatches to Britain. Capel sighted the ships to the north, but assumed that they were Généreux and Guillaume Tell and so passed by displaying French colours. Lejoille was not fooled by the disguise but did not pursue the <b>small</b> <b>vessel,</b> continuing his passage to Corfu once Mutine had sailed out of sight.|$|E
5|$|On 25 April, Dukovac and {{two others}} flew an escort mission for Henschel Hs 129 ground-attack {{aircraft}} and Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighters attacking shipping near Primorsko-Akhtarsk, during which the Croat pilots assisted in the sinking of two small vessels. On 27 April, Dukovac accounted for another LaGG-3 between Krymskaja and Abinskaja during a Heinkel He 111 escort. Dukovac claimed a victory over another LaGG-3 during a patrol three days later, {{but it was not}} seen by his wingman, as they had become separated during the fight. On 1 May, Dukovac sank a <b>small</b> <b>vessel.</b> The following day, he and three other Croat pilots were escorting a group of He 111s when two LaGG-3s tried to intercept the formation. Dukovac and another pilot both claimed to have downed one Soviet fighter each, but their destruction was not witnessed. On 3 May, a morning mission saw Dukovac claim one of four LaGG-3s encountered near Krimskaja.|$|E

40|$|To quantitatively {{assess the}} effects of age, blood pressure, chronic {{arterial}} hypertension, and physical activity on sublingual microcirculation in ambulatory volunteers. Sublingual microcirculation was assessed in 61 volunteers with or without chronic arterial hypertension. Volunteers with chronic arterial hypertension had lower TVD all <b>vessels,</b> and TVD <b>small</b> <b>vessels</b> and PVD <b>small</b> <b>vessels</b> than those without this condition (16. 0 ± 1. 4 vs. 17. 2 ± 1. 6 mm/mm(2), p < 0. 01, 15. 1 ± 1. 3 vs. 16. 1 ± 1. 7 mm/mm(2), p < 0. 04, and 15. 1 ± 1. 3 vs. 16. 1 ± 1. 7 mm/mm(2), p < 0. 04, respectively). Mean blood pressure correlated with TVD all vessels (r = - 0. 34, p < 0. 01), TVD <b>small</b> <b>vessels</b> (r = - 0. 31, p < 0. 02), and PVD <b>small</b> <b>vessels</b> (r = - 0. 27, p < 0. 04) but not with other microvascular variables.

25|$|Granulomatosis with polyangiitis {{is part of}} {{a larger}} group of vasculitic syndromes called {{systemic}} vasculitides or necrotizing vasculopathies, all of which feature an autoimmune attack by an abnormal type of circulating antibody termed ANCAs (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies) against small and medium-size blood vessels. Apart from GPA, this category includes eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) and microscopic polyangiitis. Although GPA affects small- and medium-size vessels, it is formally classified as one of the <b>small</b> <b>vessel</b> vasculitides in the Chapel Hill system.|$|E

25|$|Over the years, {{the concept}} was further {{developed}} by MARC and its successor, Aker Arctic, together with ABB and the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation (Tekes). In addition to icebreaking, the oblique vessel could also be utilized for oil spill response operations in both open and ice-infested waters by using the flat side to guide the oil to a recovery unit.

25|$|Upshaw–Schulman {{syndrome}} (USS) is the recessively inherited form of {{thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura}} (TTP), a {{rare and}} complex blood coagulation disease. USS {{is caused by the}} absence of the ADAMTS13 protease resulting in the persistence of ultra large von Willebrand factor multimers (ULVWF), causing episodes of acute thrombotic microangiopathy with disseminated multiple <b>small</b> <b>vessel</b> obstructions. These obstructions deprive downstream tissues from blood and oxygen, which can result in tissue damage and death. The presentation of an acute USS episode is variable but usually associated with thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) with schistocytes on the peripheral blood smear, fever and signs of ischemic organ damage in the brain, kidney and heart.|$|E
