500|$|Astaire's first {{seduction}} of Rogers in [...] "Isn't This a Lovely Day," [...] falls foul of the mistaken-identity {{theme of}} the plot, so he makes a second attempt, encouraged by Broderick, in the number [...] "Cheek to Cheek". As in [...] "No Strings," [...] the song emerges from Astaire's mid-sentence as he dances with the hesitant Rogers on a crowded floor. Berlin wrote the words and music to this enduring classic in one day, and, at 72 measures, it is the longest song he ever wrote. He was very appreciative of Astaire's treatment of the song: [...] "The melody keeps going up and up. He crept up there. It didn't make a damned bit of difference. He made it." [...] As he navigates through this difficult material, Rogers looks attracted and receptive and, {{at the end of}} the song, they dance cheek to cheek across a bridge to a deserted ballroom area nearby. According to Mueller's analysis, the duet that follows – easily the most famous of all the Astaire-Rogers partnered dances – reflects the complexity of the emotional situation in which the pair find themselves. No longer flirting, as in [...] "Isn't This a Lovely Day?," [...] the pair are now in love. But Rogers feels guilty and deceived and would prefer to avoid Astaire's advances – in effect, fall out of love with him. Therefore, Astaire's purpose here is to make her put aside her misgivings (which are a mystery to him) and surrender completely to him. The choreographic device introduced to reflect the progress of this seduction is the supported backbend, exploiting Rogers' exceptionally flexible back. The main dance begins with the first of two brief passages which reuse the device of sequential imitation introduced in [...] "Isn't This a Lovely Day?". The pair spin and lean, dodging back and forth past each other before moving into a standard ballroom position where the first hints of the supported backbend are introduced. The first backbend occurs at the end of a sequence where Astaire sends Rogers into a spin, collects her upstage and maneuvers her into a linked-arm stroll forward, repeats the spin but this time encircles her while <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> then takes her in his arms. As the music becomes more energetic, the dancers flow across the floor and Rogers, moving against the music, suddenly falls into a deeper backbend, which is then repeated, only deeper still. The music now transitions to a quiet recapitulation of the main melody during which the pair engage in a muted and tender partnering, and here the second passage involving sequential imitation appears. With the music reaching its grand climax Astaire and Rogers rush toward the camera, then away in a series of bold, dramatic manoeuvers culminating in three ballroom lifts which showcase Rogers' dress before abruptly coming to a halt in a final, deepest backbend, maintained as the music approaches its closing bars. They rise, and after a couple of turns dancing cheek to cheek for the first time since the dance began, come to rest next to a wall. Rogers, having conducted the dance in a state of dreamlike abandon now glances uneasily at Astaire before walking away, as if reminded that their relationship cannot proceed.|$|E

2500|$|In desperation the Beast flees {{into the}} nearby woods where {{he comes across}} a {{beautiful}} woman bathing/cooling herself by a fountain. Oddly enough, the woman {{appears to be in}} sunny daylight, {{while the rest of the}} woods and castle clearly show that it is night-time, although this may be a symbolic representation of the woman being the light to the Beast's own mental torture or [...] "darkness" [...] or a romance cliché. The woman looks into a mirror and glimpses the Beast watching her. <b>She</b> <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> he flees leaving only an amulet hanging on a branch. The woman picks it up and pursues him.|$|E

2500|$|... "Expectation {{is raised}} to its highest pitch: a {{handsome}} woman drives rapidly by in a carriage drawn by thoroughbred ponies of surpassing shape and action; {{the driver is}} attired in the pork pie hat and the Poole [...] introduced by Anonyma; but alas!, she caused no effect at all, for she is not Anonyma; she is only the Duchess of A–, the Marchioness of B–, the Countess of C–, or some other of Anonyma's many imitators. The crowd, disappointed, reseat themselves, and wait. [...] Another pony carriage succeeds – and another – with the same depressing result. [...] At last their patience is rewarded. Anonyma and her ponies appear, and they are satisfied. [...] She threads her way dexterously, with an unconscious air, through the throng, commented upon by the hundreds who admire and the hundreds who envy her. [...] She pulls up her ponies to speak to an acquaintance, and her carriage is instantly surrounded by a multitude; <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>and</b> drives back again towards Apsley House, and then away into the unknown world, nobody knows whither".|$|E
