Abstract Businesses like the Building Construction Industry (BCI) depend {{to a large}} extent on the viability of the workforce. Consequently, businesses invest heavily on the development of their employees. Regardless of the level of pro-activeness in developing and updating of human capital, it is bound to deteriorate owing to inevitable changes in the individual and workplace technology. This deterioration is known as human capital or <b>skills</b> <b>obsolescence.</b> Human capital obsolescence could be classified into technical and economic obsolescence. Technical obsolescence originates from worker's wear (illness and injuries) or atrophy due to lack of use of skills and knowledge. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the technical human obsolescence and the kind of retraining workers are engaging in to encounter <b>skills</b> <b>obsolescence</b> in the BCI in Nigeria. There are studies proffering solutions to human capital obsolescence, but there are hardly any targeting specific occupations like the BCI in developing countries like Nigeria. The available studies are not only limited to developed economies, but study clusters of occupations using variables such as wage scales that vary per occupation, and evaluate only general skills to the detriment specific to occupational skills. There is increasing evidence that BCI workers increasingly sustain injuries, sometimes fatal, at work. Also, there are contradictions in the literature on prevalence of <b>skills</b> <b>obsolescence.</b> Evidence exists that <b>skills</b> <b>obsolescence</b> leads to job loss, lack of job satisfaction, unemployment, poor productivity, and low craftsmanship. This descriptive survey was conducted in Southern Nigeria. The population consisted of 236, 175 BCI workers in the regional headquarters (Enugu, Lagos, and River States). The 387 participants with a minimum of high school education were randomly selected for the study. Data was collected using researcher-made questionnaire. The data were analyzed using Pearson Correlation Coefficient, Kruskal-Wallis H test statistics and SPSS software. Among the findings are evidence of attrition of experience older workers; the most preferred professional training technique was Job Rotation; worker's age had no correlation with physical wear, but had negative correlation with skills atrophy; years of work experience had no relationship with <b>skills</b> <b>obsolescence.</b> Based on the findings, changes in institutional strategies for the improvement of skills and general working conditions in the industry are recommended. There should be accountability on the side of the employer for providing opportunity for skills improvement and better working conditions and opportunities for workers to improve their skills. Thus, it is also recommended that the industry intermittently conducts a <b>skills</b> <b>obsolescence</b> survey with the view of finding if and where obsolescence exists...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper investigates whether {{economic}} returns to education in Norway differ across cohorts. Differences in returns to education {{may arise from}} selection effects - the large increase in educational attainment in postwar years may have changed selection into education. They may also result from changes in the school system, having been transformed towards a more egalitarian system. Finally, cohort effects may arise from <b>skills</b> <b>obsolescence</b> - technological change may make old education less worth in the labor market. The empirical results suggest {{that there has been}} a decline in the returns to education across cohorts. Controlling for self-selection into education, however, the cohort differences vanish. There is no strong evidence in favor of the <b>skills</b> <b>obsolescence</b> explanation, and no support for the hypothesis that the quality of schooling has declined over time. Cohort differences in returns to education seem to have been driven by selection effects. Keywords: Returns to education, cohort effects, educational policy, self-selection...|$|R
40|$|Objectives Mental {{retirement}} {{may occur}} when workers approach {{the end of}} their career and stop investing in new knowledge and social relationships at work. If workers stop investing in new knowledge, their skills may lose economic value and become obsolete. The processes of mental retirement itself and mental retirement that results in <b>skills</b> <b>obsolescence</b> might be countered by training and job enrichment. This is especially important because of the ageing of the population and the need to prolong working life while maintaining high productivity and good health. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the concept of mental retirement and its relationships with <b>skills</b> <b>obsolescence,</b> training, and job enrichment. Methods Based on a literature study and mind maps of scholars and employees in a large Dutch company, a conceptual model of mental retirement was constructed. Data of 12 055 employees aged 45 – 64 years included in the longitudinal Study on Transitions in Employment, Ability and Motivation (STREAM) were used to investigate this model. Factor analysis was applied. Besides, regression analyses were conducted to study the relationships between mental retirement, <b>skills</b> <b>obsolescence,</b> training and (the richness of) working tasks. Results Preliminary findings suggest that mental retirement is a multidimensional concept consisting of three constructs, ie, lower proactive developmental behavior, lower work engagement and lower willingness to continue working in the present job during the next year. Conclusion Additional findings and conclusions will be available in the coming months. Abstract Congres Work, Well-being and Wealth: Active Ageing at Work, 26 - 28 August, Helsinki, Finland...|$|R

A second goal, is to inspire readers with examples from the Netherlands, to create and test promising interventions, so that a broad set of effective interventions becomes available for each route presented. In {{the first part of this}} contribution sustainable employability is introduced as ‘a constant match between what a worker is willing and able to do and what the work demands and provides’. Employability is ‘fragile’ due to two mechanisms: <b>skills</b> <b>obsolescence</b> and motivation erosion. Both mechanisms affect all workers, but to differing degrees. We distinguish three routes to avoid adverse effects of both mechanisms: development, job redesign, and mobility. Identifying the route that is best in terms of sustainable employability depends on a clear diagnosis of the nature of the <b>skills</b> <b>obsolescence</b> and motivation erosion mechanisms. Although routes are taken by individual workers, employers have the responsibility to both accommodate and accompany a worker on finding and taking his route to sustainable employability. In the second part of this contribution we present the “Dutch case” of sustaining employability. First, we show the fragility of workers who lack basic qualification. Next, we present examples from Dutch practice that show how the dynamic perspective is applied and what different routes workers can take toward sustainable employability.

The data suggest a general rise in the returns to education between 1989 and 1992.

When market institutions were already at work, and modern technologies were implemented on a massive scale, the general appreciation of education stopped but the returns to experience continued to decline.

In our analysis, {{which is based on}} a survey among S&Es in the Netherlands, we take account of both formal training and different modes of informal learning. We find that S&Es employed in firms which apply innovative production processes more often participate in formal training and also benefit from the informal learning potential of their jobs. Therefore, public policies that stimulate process innovation also prevent <b>skills</b> <b>obsolescence</b> among S&Es. However, lifelong learning is not triggered in firms with many product innovations. S&Es who are employed in firms which operate on highly competitive markets also participate in formal training less often. The same holds for S&Es employed in small firms, although the latter compensate their lower participation in formal training by more hours of self-teaching. S&Es employed in jobs which require a high level of technical knowledge have more formal training, whereas those employed in jobs which require more general skills are significantly more involved in informal learning.

30|$|The article {{shows that}} {{teachers}} of vocational subjects do {{not participate in}} professional development activities significantly more than teachers of general subjects. This may surprise from a policy perspective. This can happen if one considers: (a) how many, how frequent and how fast are changes in nowadays labour markets occurring at technological, organisational, and job level; (b) how relevant these changes are for the vocational skills young graduates should have; (c) how important it is considered that professional development of VET teachers is used to account for and cope with those changes. Although possibly surprising, this very finding is not necessarily bad. It is fine if participation is high across all different groups of teachers. However, in a country such as Italy, where in an international perspective, teachers of vocational subjects have low participation in professional development and high needs for it, a risk emerges. The risk is that the quality of VET provision does not only stagnate, but it even deteriorates, to the extent that part of VET teachers, not participating in training, loose contact with the latest developments in the fast evolving areas of knowledge, skills and competences which the labour market will require to their pupils. This risk, further increased by the old age of VET teachers’, may undermine the overall attractiveness and labour market relevance of VET in Italy. It is a risk of <b>skills</b> <b>obsolescence</b> and it requires careful attention.|$|R
30|$|The {{theoretical}} {{foundation of}} the “lump of labour fallacy” rests on an almost perfect substitutability between young and elderly workers. According to this perspective, an old worker leaving the labour market makes room for a young worker who can perfectly substitute them in their previous task. However, several studies have questioned this notion of perfect substitutability between young and elderly workers on several grounds. Aubert et al. (2006) examined {{the effect of the}} introduction of new (IT) technologies and innovative workplace practices on the age structure of the workforce in French firms. These adjustments to new technologies and workplace practices may suggest the reasons and degree to which young and elderly workers are not perfect substitutes. Theoretically, unlike young workers, older workers – by being more skilled and experienced – may benefit potentially from technological and organisational innovations, which tend to be skill biased. On the other hand, innovation may hurt older workers by accelerating their <b>skills</b> <b>obsolescence,</b> with part of their competences becoming outdated (see Rosen 1975, and de Grip and van Loo 2002), and by requiring more adaptability and flexibility. Aubert et al. (2006) use firm-level data to find evidence of a lower wage-bill share for older workers in innovative firms, while the opposite holds for younger workers. This finding suggests a low degree of substitutability among workers of different ages, with new technologies increasing hiring opportunities significantly more for younger than for older workers. Moreover, this pattern also holds within occupational groups, thus suggesting lack of (or low) substitutability even among individuals of similar skills or educational levels. However, there is also some limited evidence on the substitutability at the firm-level. Studying the prolonged retirement age for women in Portugal in 1994 Portugal et al. 2009 did a quasi-experiment by comparing firms with and without women. They pointed out that an increase in retirement age decreases the hiring rate among the youths, particularly for women.|$|R

40|$|Aging {{diversity}} in organizations creates potential challenges, particularly for knowledge management, skills update and <b>skills</b> <b>obsolescence.</b> Intergenerational learning (IGL) involves knowledge building, innovation and knowledge transfer between generations within an organization (Ropes 2011). Serious games {{refer to the}} use of computer games in raising awareness about educational topics, acquiring new knowledge and skills by enabling learners to engage and participate in situations that would otherwise be impossible to experience (Corti 2006). Although learning with the use of serious games is similar to traditional learning in several cognitive respects, there are noted differences in the learning style and structure of learning using serious games. The success of learning using serious games lies in the actual involvement of a participant playing the game, which in turn, creates increased cognitive links with real-life situations allowing the individual to make relevant associations, to use mnemonic strategies with the facilitation of multi-dimensional educational aids (e. g., visual, auditory). Some of the beneficial aspects of learning with the use of serious games include the elevation of several cognitive skills, which are directly or indirectly implicated in the learning process. Among them are attention and visuo-spatial abilities, memory and motor skills. However, several barriers have been noted that fall into two general categories: a) health issues (e. g., cognitive strain, headaches) and b) psychological issues (e. g., social isolation, emotional disturbances). Since the training conditions are learner-centered and highly determined by the individual, there is increased need for evaluating the learning outcomes using specific success indicators. Examples of games that are designed to facilitate IGL are scarce, while there are no examples of IGL games in most EU countries.

Aside from keeping organizational information systems operative, when such systems fail these workers are called upon to rapidly restore the systems and thus head-off any negative commercial or political consequences. Yet these workers are acknowledged only as objectified resources within the ITSM ‘best practice’ literature (e. g. Taylor, Iqbal and Nieves, 2007) and largely overlooked as a distinctive contemporary worker-type within academic discourse. This paper, through analysis of salary data and qualitative data collected for a multiple case study research project, considers the extent to which these workers might be conceived of as being ‘professionals’. The project approached the conceptual study of these workers through three lenses. This paper focuses on the project’s consideration of them as rationalised information systems assets within ‘best practice’ ITSM theory. It also draws upon our considerations of them as knowledge workers and service workers. We firstly situate the IT service support worker within a broader model of IT workers comprising four overlapping groupings: managers, developers, technical specialists and IT service support workers. Three types of IT service support worker are identified: first-line workers who routinely escalate work; second-line workers; and ‘expert’ single-line workers. With reference to close associations made with call centre workers (e. g. Murphy, 2011) the status of IT service support workers is explored through analysis of: (i) salary data taken from the ITJOBSWATCH website; and (ii) observational and interview data collected in the field. From this we challenge the veracity of the notion that the whole occupational field of IT might be termed a profession concurrently with the notion that a profession implies work of high status. Secondly, the paper explores two forces that might be associated with the professionalization of IT as an occupation: (i) rationalisation of the field (here promoted by the British Computer Society); and (ii) formalisation of IT theoretical/vocational education. A tension is identified, with those IT service support workers whose work is least disposed to rationalisation and whose complex ‘stocks of knowledge’ (Schutz, 1953) have been acquired through time-spent practice laying claim to greater IT professional status. Thirdly, consideration is given to individuals’ personal career orientations: occupational, organizational and customer-centric (Kinnie and Swart, 2012). We find that whilst organizations expect IT service support workers to be orientated towards serving the interests of the organization and its clients, the most individualistically professional tend towards being occupationally orientated, enthusiastically (re) developing their skills to counter <b>skills</b> <b>obsolescence</b> in an evolving technological arena (Sennett, 2006) ...|$|R
40|$|Governments {{across much}} of the {{developed}} world are concerned to increase labour market activity rates and employment among older workers. A variety of policies have been advocated including the improvement of education and training provision. This paper evaluates the role that such provision might play. Clearly it is always designed to, and usually succeeds in, increasing the human capital of its recipients, in the sense that, to varying degrees, knowledge and skills are enhanced. However, if this is to improve the labour market position of individuals, the extra human capital must be economically productive and throughout the paper the emphasis is on this. The paper briefly outlines the nature of labour market disadvantage suffered by older workers, who are defined as those over 54. It goes on to discuss the causes of the disadvantage and considers whether better education and training might alleviate it. It evaluates some policy initiatives and concludes that education and training have only a limited role to play in the absence of accompanying policy measures. Amongst older workers, inactivity and unemployment are particularly heavily concentrated amongst the less educated and the less skilled. This is often attributed to globalisation, skill-biased technological progress or job-queuing. Despite such explanations, {{it is not clear what}} role lack of skill per se plays in this disadvantage. Labour market regulations, seniority or age related-wages, moral hazard, the attitudes of older workers themselves and <b>skills</b> <b>obsolescence,</b> as well as age discrimination, may help to explain the underprivileged position of older workers in the labour market. In addition to having low employment and activity rates, older workers receive little training. What is eminently clear is that the problem is particularly concentrated amongst those who are less educated or skilled, amongst those who missed out on education and training early in their lives - once at the bottom of the heap, always at the bottom of the heap. OECD Governments are concerned to bring older workers out of unemployment into employment and out of inactivity into employment. They embrace training as one possible means of achieving this aim. The available evidence suggests two overarching conclusions – one general and one specific to the paper’s immediate concerns. The general one is that the relationship between training and a country’s economic success is more problematic and complex than often apparently appreciated by policy makers. For the individual, education and training on the whole improve labour market prospects. But there are qualifications. Not all education and training is equally powerful in achieving this; in the UK, for example, short episodes of work-based training or training when unemployed have limited impact, whilst returns to vocationally orientated courses are less than to academic ones. The specific conclusion is that one could not hope to offset decades of labour market disadvantage by giving an individual a couple of weeks or even a couple of months training. This suggests the need to be modest in one’s aims. The best available evidence, particularly from the active manpower policy literature, suggests very strongly that training programmes, on their own, are of limited use in bringing people out of unemployment or inactivity into jobs. Of prime importance are subsidies and targeted job search and job placement programmes; and even here there are risks of deadweight loss and of ineffectiveness if they are not part of a larger policy package. Even if training can, in principle, help to bring people back into work, the jobs they acquire may not be brilliant ones. This implies a problem of incentives. Depending on the social security/pension regime prevailing, workers may not be inclined to take on low-paying or low status jobs. Indiscriminately providing training, in the absence of other linked initiatives, would be wasteful. The paper stresses the importance of continuous learning during the whole of working life as a means of reducing the dangers of labour market disadvantage in the older years. It also argues that formal 3 training episodes are not the only route to continuous learning. Informal learning and development are also critical, and these are closely related to broader aspects of job quality. For those who are in work, lack of training may be at least as much a symptom as a cause of job insecurity. The problem is not only making the workers more attractive, it is also a matter of making the jobs on offer more attractive. The more high quality jobs there are available, the greater the demand for skill and the more training and development that will be in offer. Though some of it will be specific to each employing organisation, much of it is likely to be transferable, even in the absence of government intervention to deal with possible externalities. Without a large number of high quality jobs, some people are going to suffer. Although an increase in the number of well-trained people might enable some employers to enhance the quality of some jobs, on its own training is unlikely to dramatically alter the quality mix of jobs on offer. The key to preventing the older worker suffering disproportionately in such circumstances almost certainly lies elsewhere than in training. The lack of training received by older workers is dominantly a symptom of broader problems they face. And it is these broader problems that deserve prime attention. One limited role that training might play, though almost certainly it would have to be heavily subsidised by governments, would be to prepare older workers for self-employment as an alternative to the hostile climate they face as employees...|$|R
