50|$|Many {{algorithms}} explicitly fit 0-degree splines to {{the noisy}} signal {{in order to}} detect steps (including stepwise jump placement methods), {{but there are other}} popular algorithms that can also be seen to be <b>spline</b> <b>fitting</b> methods after some transformation, for example total variation denoising.|$|E
50|$|Because {{the aim of}} step {{detection}} is to find {{a series}} of instantaneous jumps in the mean of a signal, the wanted, underlying, mean signal is piecewise constant. For this reason, step detection can be profitably viewed as the problem of recovering a piecewise constant signal corrupted by noise. There are two complementary models for piecewise constant signals: as 0-degree splines with a few knots, or as level sets with a few unique levels. Many algorithms for step detection are therefore best understood as either 0-degree <b>spline</b> <b>fitting,</b> or level set recovery, methods.|$|E

40|$|A new {{approach}} for image de-noising is developed in this paper. It {{is based on}} bivariate spline functions. By choosing a local region from a de-noised image by using any current method, one can further reduce the remaining noises by minimizing the surface area of <b>fitting</b> <b>spline</b> functions. The existence, uniqueness and stability of the minimal surface area splines are studied and an iterative algorithm to compute the <b>fitting</b> <b>splines</b> of minimal surface area is derived. The convergence of the iterative solutions will be established. In addition, the <b>fitting</b> <b>splines</b> of minimal surface area are convergent as the size of triangulation goes to zero in theory. Finally, a couple of numerical examples are shown to demonstrate {{the effectiveness of this}} {{new approach}}. ...|$|R

50|$|For a {{temporal}} signal of length M, {{the complexity of}} cubic spline sifting through its local extrema is about the order of M, and so {{is that of the}} EEMD as it only repeats the <b>spline</b> <b>fitting</b> operation with a number that is not dependent on M. However, as the sifting number (often selected as 10) and the ensemble number (often a few hundred) multiply to the spline sifting operations, hence the EEMD is time consuming compared with many other time series analysis methods such as Fourier Transforms and Wavelet Transforms.The MEEMD employs EEMD decomposition of the time serie s at each division grids of the initial temporal signal, the EEMD operation is repeated by the number of total grid points of the domain. The idea of the fast MEEMD is very simple. As PCA/EOF-based compression expressed the original data in terms of pairs of PCs and EOFs, through decomposing PCs, instead of time series of each grid, and using the corresponding spatial structure depicted by the corresponding EOFs, the computational burden can be significantly reduced.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we propose}} a {{modified}} variational <b>splines</b> <b>fitting</b> (MVSF) algorithm for the reconstruction and comparison of medical surfaces. The MVSF algorithm presents the advantage to use high precise and low complex approximation of the equations {{of energy in}} the discrete temporal domain, compared to previously presented methods. It also takes into account the periodicity constraints encountered when reconstructing sphere-like shape closed surfaces. Moreover, it gives straightly the mean square error (MSE) between the original data and the reconstructed data, which is useful to quantify the approximation introduced by the reconstruction.

40|$|Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) {{signal is}} a very {{important}} measure to know the Heart actual conditions. Thus a proper analysis of this ECG signal is must. The ECG signal is mainly contained with PQRST waves among which QRS complex is the high frequency part and other are low frequency part. During the acquisition of the ECG signal few noises gets attached with it that may cause a huge misinterpretation. Among these noises Baseline Wandering is a low frequency noise and can mask some important features of the ECG signal; mainly while analyzing ST segment. Hence it is desirable to remove this noise for proper analysis of the ECG signal. This paper presents various approaches for baseline noise removal in the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal which include methods based on median filtering, adaptive filtering, wavelet adaptive filtering, zero phase filtering, use of project pursuit gradient ascent, cubic <b>spline</b> curve <b>fitting,</b> linear <b>spline</b> curve <b>fitting,</b> high pass filtering, moving average approach, Savitzky-Golay Polynomial approach and empirical mode decomposition...|$|R

In this paper we made use of the IMFs orthogonality property to apply a symmetrical window to the data before EMD for end-effect reduction. Subsequently the IMFs are post-processed to compensate for data alteration due to windowing. The simulations show that IMFs obtained with this method are of better quality near the data boundaries while remaining almost identical to classical EMD one...|$|R
