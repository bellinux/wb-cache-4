The research questions were based on effects of management information <b>system</b> <b>implementation</b> on individual, group — social and organizational resistance causes of personnel and managers. With regard to this matter, in this research, the researchers intended to {{study the effects of}} management information <b>system</b> <b>implementation</b> on the resistance causes of personnel. Thus the research methodology has been of descriptive with survey research. The findings of research indicated that management information <b>system</b> <b>implementation</b> created individual resistance causes in personnel. But has not created group — social and organizational resistance causes on personnel. Thus, overall it was concluded that management information <b>system</b> <b>implementation</b> created personnel resistance causes. On the other hand, research findings showed that management information <b>system</b> <b>implementation</b> did not created individual, group — social resistance causes on managers.

40|$|Implementing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) {{system for}} Malaysian Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs) {{is not just}} a {{technological}} challenge. It is a socio-technological endeavour which mandates modifying existing applications and redesigning business processes to facilitate ERP <b>system</b> <b>implementation.</b> Most Malaysian SMEs cannot afford to adopt an existing ERP system due to the extremely high cost and complex <b>implementation.</b> The ERP <b>system</b> <b>implementation</b> literature contains many case studies of organizations that have implemented ERP system successfully. However, many Malaysian SMEs do not achieve success in their ERP <b>system</b> <b>implementation.</b> There are very few studies have represented and developed critical success factors of ERP <b>system</b> <b>implementation</b> projects highlighted for SMEs. This research seeks to explore the critical success factors for successful ERP <b>system</b> <b>implementation</b> in Malaysian SMEs. The research method is based on a case study within Malaysian SME to perform a critical success factors model of ERP <b>system</b> <b>implementation</b> adoption which has validated by a number of SMEs in Malaysia. The proposed model will help outline the critical factors that should be considered by Malaysian SMEs in uccessfully adopting ERP system...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The Malaysian {{small to}} medium {{enterprises}} (SMEs) market has big influences {{in the business}} world which is becoming more competitive. Therefore, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) as a functional unit integrated system is needed to streamline the business processes to achieve greater work efficiency. However, an in depth understanding about ERP system is needed to ensure the successful <b>system</b> <b>implementation.</b> This paper seeks to explore the challenges of ERP <b>system</b> <b>implementation</b> in order to deepen the knowledge on ERP <b>system</b> <b>implementation</b> in SMEs. The research method is based on a single-case design within Malaysian SME to obtain a process model of ERP <b>system</b> <b>implementation</b> adoption by SMEs. The conceptual framework for ERP <b>system</b> <b>implementation,</b> which was validated by a number of SMEs in Malaysia, is proposed in order to attempt the minimize ERP project failure in SMEs...|$|R
40|$|Implementing an {{enterprise}} resource planning (ERP) system often means a major change to an organization and involves significant risks. It is typical {{that many of the}} ERP <b>system</b> <b>implementations</b> fail resulting in tremendous damage to the business. Moreover, running normal business operations during an ERP <b>system</b> <b>implementation</b> is far more complicated than normally. This thesis focuses on how an organization should manage the ERP <b>system</b> <b>implementation</b> process in order to maintain supply performance during the implementation phase. The theoretical framework in this thesis focuses on ERP <b>system</b> <b>implementations</b> with a critical success factor approach. Critical success factors can be divided into strategic and tactical level success factors. By considering these critical success factors, ERP <b>system</b> <b>implementation</b> project’s timeline and best practices of an ERP implementation, a critical success factor based ERP <b>system</b> <b>implementation</b> management framework is presented. The framework {{can be used as a}} theoretical framework when the goal is to avoid ERP <b>system</b> <b>implementation</b> phase issues that are driven by the ERP <b>system</b> <b>implementation</b> project and that may decrease organization’s supply performance. This thesis is a case study that was written on an assignment to a confectionary company Cloetta Suomi Oy. In order to collect data, interviews of the case company personnel were conducted. In addition, several other data collection methods were used throughout the research process. These data collection methods include examination of presentations and archival records as well as direct observations in case company meetings and in various work duties. The results of this thesis indicate that there are several factors that may decrease organization’s supply performance during the ERP <b>system</b> <b>implementation.</b> These issues are categorized under external and internal issues and further into six risk drivers that are suppliers, customers, products, staff, information systems and other projects. After the description and categorization of each issue, the thesis focuses on finding solutions on how to avoid or mitigate the impact of these issues on the organization’s supply performance. This examination leads to several operational activities that are also practical to business practitioners. It is also stated that a successful ERP <b>system</b> <b>implementation</b> that also causes minimal disturbance to organization’s supply performance during the ERP <b>system</b> <b>implementation,</b> is achieved by considering three levels of actions...|$|R

Implementing various kinds of information systems, such as Decision Support Systems, has been {{recognized as one of the}} most crucial tasks for organizations in order to continue to be competitive or even to survive. Although considerable effort has been devoted to improving the performance of information <b>system</b> <b>implementations,</b> organizations are still constantly suffering from the failures of information <b>system</b> <b>implementations.</b> In this study an extensive framework that depicts the context of information <b>system</b> <b>implementation</b> is developed.

The imperative nature of operating <b>system</b> <b>implementations,</b> the programming languages chosen, and the usually selected implementation style combine to make verification of a general-purpose operating system kernel impractical.
