25|$|Spring {{training}} got underway for the Dodgers on February 15, 2017, when {{pitchers and}} catchers officially reported to Camelback Ranch to begin their workouts. The Dodgers made a trade early in spring training, sending pitcher Chase De Jong to the Seattle Mariners for minor league infielder Drew Jackson and minor league pitcher Aneurys Zabala. With most of the positions in the lineup locked in before camp, the major battle was {{for the last couple}} of spots in the starting rotation behind Clayton Kershaw, Rich Hill and Kenta Maeda. In the mix were veterans Brandon McCarthy, Scott Kazmir and Hyun-jin Ryu, all of whom were coming back from injuries as well as Alex Wood, Ross <b>Stripling,</b> Julio Urias and Brock Stewart.

[...] Instead of spending the summer recovering from appendicitis, he spent the summer working as an assistant barkeeper on a steamship plying between Chicago and St. Joseph, Michigan. [...] Maulbetsch spent his afternoons swimming and running sprints {{up and down the}} beach. [...] On one trip, a giant coal passer claimed to be the strongest man in the world, and Maulbetsch agreed to a wrestling match on the boat. [...] "The coal passer rushed the <b>stripling,</b> who ducked, caught his opponent about the waist and crushed him to the deck. [...] When the giant woke, he wanted to know if the boat hit a rock." [...] As the season started, The New York Times wrote: [...] "Michigan's come-back football team, headed by Bullet Maulbetsch, {{is going to be an}} eleven to be reckoned with on the gridiron this Fall." [...] Maulbetsch returned to his prior form, and one of the writers who had criticized him in 1915 said [...] "the great Michigander using the same method of attack, has repeatedly broken in fragments this year the lines that he couldn’t dent in 1915." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout his {{literary}} career, Willis was well liked and {{known for his}} good nature amongst friends. Well traveled and clever, he had a striking appearance at six feet tall and was typically dressed elegantly. Many, however, remarked that Willis was effeminate, Europeanized, and guilty of [...] "Miss Nancyism". One editor called him [...] "an impersonal passive verb—a pronoun of the feminine gender". A contemporary caricature depicted him wearing a fashionable beaver hat and tightly closed coat and carrying a cane, reflecting Willis's wide reputation as a [...] "dandy". Willis put considerable effort into his appearance and his fashion sense, presenting himself {{as a member of}} an upcoming American aristocracy. As Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. once said, Willis was [...] "something between a remembrance of Count D'Orsay and an anticipation of Oscar Wilde". Publisher Charles Frederick Briggs once wrote that [...] "Willis was too Willisy". He described his writings as the [...] "novelty and gossip of the hour" [...] and was not necessarily concerned about facts but with the [...] "material of conversation and speculation, which may be mere rumor, may be the truth". Willis's behavior in social groups annoyed fellow poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. [...] "He is too artificial", Longfellow wrote to his friend George Washington Greene. [...] "And his poetry has now lost one of its greatest charms for me—its sincerity". E. Burke Fisher, a journalist in Pittsburgh, wrote that [...] "Willis is a kind of national pet and we must regard his faults as we do those of a spoiled <b>stripling,</b> in the hope that he will amend".|$|E

2500|$|The Dodger had 13 hits on September 2 {{against the}} San Diego Padres, {{including}} four by Howie Kendrick, but left 11 men on base and lost 4–2 with Yangervis Solarte's eighth inning homer the key blow. Rich Hill allowed only one hit in six innings {{the next game}} and Josh Reddick hit his first homer as a Dodger in [...] a 5–1 win. José De León struck out nine in six innings in his major league debut and Yasiel Puig and Yasmani Grandal homered as the Dodgers won the series finale 7–4. The Dodgers hit five homers off former teammate Zack Greinke of the Arizona Diamondbacks in a 10–2 victory on Labor Day. They won again the next day, 5–2, behind a solid start by Ross <b>Stripling,</b> whose 66 pitched in five innings was the fewest by a winning Dodgers starter since Greg Maddux threw 47 pitches in six innings on September 27, 2008. Puig homered again and Brock Stewart pitched five innings of one run ball as the Dodgers swept the Diamondbacks with a 3–1 win.|$|E
2500|$|The Dodgers {{returned}} home on May 8 {{for a series}} against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Alex Wood struck out 11 batters in five innings. This was a Dodger record for most strikeouts in a start of five or fewer innings, breaking the mark previously held by Sandy Koufax (1961) and Vicente Padilla (2009). Chris Taylor hit a grand slam {{in the first inning}} and the Dodgers cruised to a 12–1 win. Julio Urías took a no-hitter into the 7th in the next game, but was broken up by the Pirates, who scored two runs in the 7th to tie the game and John Jaso hitting the go-ahead home run an inning later to lead 3-2. [...] At the bottom of the 9th inning, Cody Bellinger drove in Corey Seager with a game-tying single, sending the game in extras and Austin Barnes drove in pinch runner Ross <b>Stripling</b> with a walk-off double in the 10th for a 4–3 Dodgers win. Bellinger homered again in the next game and Maeda allowed two runs in 8 [...] innings as the Dodgers finished off the series sweep with a 5–2 win.|$|E
2500|$|In 1928, Miller {{spent several}} months in Paris with June, a trip which was financed by Freedman. One day on a Paris street, Miller met another author, Robert W. Service, who {{recalled}} the story in his autobiography: [...] "Soon we got into conversation which turned to books. For a <b>stripling</b> he spoke with some authority, turning into ridicule the pretentious scribes of the Latin Quarter and their freak magazine." [...] In 1930, Miller moved to Paris unaccompanied. Soon after, he began work on Tropic of Cancer, writing to a friend, [...] "I start tomorrow on the Paris book: First person, uncensored, formless - fuck everything!" [...] Although Miller {{had little or no}} money the first year in Paris, things began to change after meeting Anaïs Nin who, with Hugh Guiler, went on to pay his entire way through the 1930s including the rent for an apartment at 18 Villa Seurat. Nin became his lover and financed the first printing of Tropic of Cancer in 1934 with money from Otto Rank. She would write extensively in her journals about her relationship with Miller and his wife June; the first volume, covering the years 1931-34, was published in 1966. Late in 1934, June divorced Miller by proxy in Mexico City.|$|E
2500|$|Bellinger again hit two {{homers in}} the very next game, on June 13 in the Dodgers 7–5 victory over the Cleveland Indians at Progressive Field. He became the first Dodger player to hit two home runs in {{back-to-back}} games since Adrián Beltré in the 2004 season and by reaching the mark in 45 games he was the fastest player in MLB history with four career multi-homer games, besting Bob Horner who did so in 63 games in 1978. A pinch hit homer by Kike Hernández in the 8th inning gave the Dodgers the lead the next day, in a game they won 6–4. However, the Dodgers winning streak {{came to an end}} on June 15 when the Indians scored seven runs off Rich Hill in four innings and Lonnie Chisenhall clubbed a three-run homer off of reliever Ross <b>Stripling</b> en route to a 12–5 Cleveland victory. [...] Joc Pederson homered and Alex Wood allowed only one run in eight innings pitched as the Dodgers won 3–1 over the Cincinnati Reds at Great American Ball Park the next day. [...] The Dodgers scored five runs {{in the top of the}} third inning in the next game as they beat the Reds 10–2.

Bellinger became the fastest player in Dodgers history to hit nine home runs. In the series finale, Adrian Gonzalez was 3 for 4 with three RBI and Joc Pederson homered as the Dodgers won 6–3 to take the series. After an off-day, the Dodgers continued their homestand with a three-game series with the St. Louis Cardinals. In the opener, Kershaw allowed only one run on three hits while striking out 10 in nine innings but was matched by Lance Lynn of the Cardinals who allowed one run on two hits with 10 strikeouts in eight innings. The Dodgers eventually won 2–1 on a walk-off double by Logan Forsythe, who came off the disabled list before the game, in the 13th inning. The following day, Mike Leake allowed only four hits in eight innings while Rich Hill struggled, walking seven, a career high, and allowing five runs in only four innings, as the Cardinals won 6–1 to even the series. [...] In the series finale, the Dodgers came back from a 3-0 deficit to take the series with a 7-3 win. Kenta Maeda's two run RBI single in the fourth put the Dodgers ahead for good and Hyun-Jin Ryu pitched four scoreless innings out of the bullpen to earn his first major league save. The Dodgers would conclude their 10-game homestead with a 3-day weekend series with the Chicago Cubs.

McCarthy and <b>Stripling</b> combined to shutdown the Cubs, with <b>Stripling</b> getting his first career save with three innings of relief. Utley drove in three runs and Chris Taylor hit his sixth home run of the season in the 5–0 victory. The Dodgers wrapped up their long homestand with a 9–4 win and a series sweep of the Cubs {{for the first time since}} the 2012 season. Kershaw struggled, giving up four runs, and failed to make it out of the fifth inning, but Bellinger hit his 10th home run of the season, the fastest Dodger to reach that mark in franchise history, and Kike Hernández, Austin Barnes and Puig also homered in the game.|$|E
2500|$|Curtis Granderson homered off {{the first}} pitch by Scott Kazmir on May 9, as the New York Mets went on to beat the Dodgers 4–2 at Dodger Stadium. A {{pitchers}} duel between Alex Wood and Jacob deGrom the following day went the Dodgers way, 3–2, thanks to a walk-off home run by Trayce Thompson. The Mets took the third game, 4–3, thanks to starting pitcher Noah Syndergaard. He pitched eight strong innings and also hit two home runs, driving in all the teams runs. Dodger starter Kenta Maeda became just the second Dodgers pitcher in history to allow multiple home runs in a game to pitchers, joining Doug McWeeny, who allowed homers to Erv Brame and Fred Fussell of the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 7, 1929 at Ebbets Field. The Dodgers won the next game, 5–0, behind another dominate Clayton Kershaw start. He struck out 13 while pitching a two-hit complete game shutout. He set a MLB record with five consecutive starts with at least 10 strikeouts {{and no more than}} one walk and a club record with five consecutive starts with at least 10 strikeouts. Yasiel Puig was 3-for-five with a homer and 2 RBI and Ross <b>Stripling</b> picked up his first major league win as the Dodgers beat the St. Louis Cardinals, 8–4 on May 13. Scott Kazmir pitched 8 [...] innings and struck out seven as the Dodgers won 5–3 the following day. A pinch-hit RBI double by Yadier Molina helped the Cardinals beat up on the Dodgers bullpen and prevent the sweep, 5–2. Albert Pujols and Mike Trout combined for five RBI as the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim beat the Dodgers 7–6 in the opener of the Freeway Series on May 16. Kershaw struck out 11 in eight innings the next game in a 5–1 win.|$|E
2500|$|The Dodgers {{went back}} on the road for a series against the San Francisco Giants at AT Park on September 11. The opener was delayed 3 [...] hours by rain but the result was the same, as the Dodgers lost their 11th {{straight}} game, 8–6. In the next game, Kershaw allowed two runs (one earned) on eight hits in six innings with six strikeouts and the Dodgers snapped their longest losing streak since 1944 with a 5–3 win over the Giants.

On September 15, they traveled to Nationals Park for a three-game weekend series against the National League East champion Washington Nationals. In the opener, Alex Wood struck out eight and only allowed three hits in six shutout innings and the Dodgers homered three times, including a three-run blast by Corey Seager. They won the game 7–0. Rich Hill struck out seven in five innings while only allowing one hit in the following game and Bellinger hit his 38th home run of the season, tying the National League rookie record previously set by Wally Berger (1930) and Frank Robinson (1956).

In the final game of the series, Ryan Zimmerman hit a three-run homerun in the sixth inning off of reliever Ross <b>Stripling</b> and the Nationals went ahead to a 7–1 win to avoid the sweep. The Dodgers next traveled to Citizens Bank Park for a four-game mid-week series against the team with the second worst record in the National League, the Philadelphia Phillies. They jumped out to a 2–0 lead in the first inning after an inside-the-park homer by Chris Taylor and a normal homer by Justin Turner. However, Aaron Altherr hit a grand slam off of Kershaw in the sixth to lead the Phillies to a 4–3 upset win.

2500|$|The Dodgers {{began the}} 2016 season at Petco Park against the San Diego Padres on April 4. Clayton Kershaw made his sixth {{straight}} opening day {{start for the}} Dodgers and allowed only one hit in seven innings with nine strikeouts. The offense erupted as well, as the Dodgers started {{the season with a}} 15–0 rout. It was the best ever margin of victory in franchise history and also the first time they had won six straight opening day games. The 15 runs was one short of the franchise opening day record of 16 set against the Houston Astros in 1983. Scott Kazmir made his Dodgers debut the following night, pitching six scoreless innings while also allowing only one hit, as the Dodgers, with a 3–0 victory, got back-to-back-shutouts to open a season {{for the first time since}} 1974.

The Dodgers traveled to AT Park for the next series against the San Francisco Giants.

The Dodger bullpen then allowed a bunch of runs, including a grand slam by Hunter Pence to pull away and the Giants won 12–6. Ross <b>Stripling</b> made his major league debut in the second game of the series. He pitched a no-hitter for 7 [...] innings but was taken out of the game with a two run lead after walking a batter and reaching his 100th pitch.

Kershaw pitched eight innings for the Dodgers in the following game, but allowed two solo homer and got a no-decision. The Dodgers came back to win the game on an RBI double by Charlie Culberson in the 10th inning, 3–2. In the final game of the road trip, the Dodgers scored five runs in the top of the first but saw the lead quickly disappear as Scott Kazmir allowed three homers and six total runs in only four innings. He was the first Dodgers pitcher to allow three homers to the Giants at San Francisco since Ismael Valdez in 1997. [...] A two-run double by Joe Panik off reliever J. P.
