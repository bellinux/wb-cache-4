An increase of <b>spraying</b> <b>speed</b> significantly lowered coverage values at the front and rear parts of a wheat head. At all three spraying speeds, the rear part of a wheat head reached a better coverage value. The effect of <b>spraying</b> <b>speed</b> was significant in 2011, when the 5 km/h <b>spraying</b> <b>speed</b> generated a significantly higher grain yield and a significantly higher thousand-grain weight in comparison with the other treatments. In both trial years, the lowest grain yield occurred on the unsprayed control. In 2011 and 2012, the latter also reached the lowest hectolitre weight and thousand-grain weight. In both trial years, the unsprayed control had a significantly higher DONcontent than the other treatments. In 2012, the DONcontent on the unsprayed control exceeded the allowed maximum level. The <b>spraying</b> <b>speed</b> did not affect the DON content in the grains. The effect of <b>spraying</b> <b>speed</b> was also noted in the FHB incidence.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the effects of the removal of pesticide residues and microorganisms from yuja (Citrus junos Sieb ex Tanaka) using a surface-washing system, under the following washing conditions: 0. 11, 0. 42, and 0. 73 m/s spray rotation speeds; 0. 6, 0. 9, and 1. 2 MPa water pressure and 0. 046, 0. 092, and 0. 138 m/s conveying speeds. Tap-water treatment was used as the control. The washing efficiency when using squid ink was highly correlated with the conveying <b>speed</b> and the <b>spray</b> rotation <b>speed.</b> In addition, the highest washing efficiency was achieved when the water pressure was 0. 9 MPa. The microorganisms were reduced to 0. 40 log CFU/g for the tap-water treatment, and all the treatments, except those at the conveying speed of 0. 138 m/s and the <b>spray</b> rotation <b>speed</b> of 0. 11 rpm (6. 07 log CFU/g), produced higher removal efficiencies compared with the tap-water treatment. Reductions of 2. 20 and 2. 05 log CFU/g were achieved at the <b>spray</b> rotation <b>speeds</b> of 0. 42 and 0. 73, respectively. The largest reductions were observed when the conveying speed was 0. 046 m/s. Higher pesticide residue removal efficiency values were obtained at slower conveying <b>speeds</b> and higher <b>spray</b> rotation <b>speeds.</b> Higher than 50 % removal efficiency was achieved when the <b>spray</b> rotation <b>speed</b> was 0. 046 m/s for spirodichlofen, deltamethrin, benomyl, thiophanate-methyl, and acequinocyl. Especially, the removal efficiency for benomyl and thiophanate-methyl was more than 90 %.

In this study, we investigated sprays resulting from the impacts of water-filled metal projectiles on a hard wall. The weights of the projectiles were {{in the range of}} 38 – 110 kg, with 8. 6 – 68 kg water, and the impact speeds varied between 96 and 169 m/s. The overall spray behaviour was observed with high-speed video cameras. Ultra-high-speed cameras were used in backlight configuration for measuring the droplet size and velocity distributions. The results indicate that the liquid leaves the impact position as a thin sheet of spray in a direction perpendicular to the projectile velocity.

40|$|Purpose: In this study, a {{numerical}} simulation {{model of the}} oil spraying system is established. Design/methodology/approach: Spraying lubrication is a common form of the rolling bearing lubrication. Butwith the increase of the bearing speed, the roller cage is frequently shattered, which may lead to failure of thebearing. The shatter of roller cage {{may be related to}} the spraying mode of oil. For high-speed rolling bearing,the roller cage shatter can be cracked due to the shortage of oil, caused by lubricating oil not sprayed into theroller cage shatter. This condition can be ameliorated by changing the spraying mode of oil supply system. Themodel considered the <b>spraying</b> <b>speed,</b> spraying angle, oil pressure, oil viscosity, structure of roller cage shatter,rotating speed as the main parameters. By optimization, the best way of oil spraying was obtained which canmeet lubrication requirement of high-speed rolling bearing. At the same time, the numerical simulation resultsalso revealed that the optimal spraying mode is different for different rolling bearings. Findings: The simulating results indicate that due to the effect of the air pressure and airflow thickness, theoptimal spraying position is at a region closer to the inner ring of the bearings.

40|$|ABSTRACT This {{study used}} an image {{processing}} method to analyze spray depositions on water-sensitive paper. A Scanner was used to transfer the image deposited on water-sensitive paper in this system. To measure {{the efficiency of the}} spray machine, water- sensitive paper analysis is the simplesu method. This study used water-sensitive paper to collect the spray depositions and a scanner to digitize the spray depositions into image information. Image processing was then applied to analyze the depositions, and threshold was used to segment the object from the background. Labeling was used to count the number of droplets. Using image processing we can determine droplet size distribution,coverage density, and the percentage of the coverage. The result of this study revealed that the image processing algorithms were used to extract deposit features and measure the target area covered by the deposits. The percent area covered as measured by image analysis decreased as spray high or <b>spray</b> <b>speed</b> increased or hydraulic pressure decreased. The advantages of image processing techniques applied to analyze spray deposition are increasing the speed of analysis and reducing the labor involved.

40|$|Recently, the {{high-pressure}} {{fuel injection}} performance of common-rail direct injection (CRDi) engines {{has become more}} important, due {{to the need to}} improve the multi-injection strategy. A multiple injection strategy provides better emission and fuel economy characteristics than a normal single injection scheme. The CRDi engine performance changes with the type of high-pressure electro-mechanical injector that is used and its injection response in a multi-injection scheme. In this study, a direct needle-driven piezo injector (DPI) was investigated, to optimize its actuation components, including the plate length, number of springs, and the elasticity of the spring between the injector needle and the piezo stack. Three prototype DPIs were proposed by this research. They were classified as Type 1, 2, and 3, depending on whether the injector needle was hydraulic or mechanical. Then, the optimal prototype was determined by conducting four evaluation experiments analyzing the maximum injection pressure, injection rate, spray visualization, and real engine combustion application.

For smaller drop sizes, down to around 60 microns, flame speed is inversely proportional to drop size, indicating that evaporation rates are limiting to flame speed.

Most significant are the choice of hydrofluoroalkane- 134 a (HFA- 134 a) as a new propellant (rather than chloroflu-orocarbon, CFC), a smaller exit nozzle diameter and attachment of a spacer {{in order to reduce}} ultimately droplet size and <b>spray</b> inhalation <b>speed,</b> both contributing to higher deposition ef-ficiencies and hence better asthma therapy. Although asthma medicine is rather inexpensive, the specter of systemic side effects triggered by inefficient pMDI performance and the in-creasing use of such devices as well as new targeted drug–aerosol delivery for various lung and other diseases make detailed performance analyses imperative. For the first time, exper-imentally validated computational fluid-particle dynamics technique has been applied to sim-ulate airflow, droplet spray transport and aerosol deposition in a pMDI attached to a human upper airway model, considering different device propellants, nozzle diameters, and spacer use. The results indicate that the use of HFA (replacing CFC), smaller valve orifices (0. 25 mm instead of 0. 5 mm) and spacers (ID 4. 2 cm) leads to best performance mainly because o...|$|R
40|$|Single-walled carbon {{nanotubes}} (SWNTs) {{have been}} introduced as compliant electrodes for dielectric elastomers (DEs) due to fault tolerance. To acquire a better electrostrictive strain and longer lifetime, {{it is essential to}} obtain a certain and uniform width of the SWNT electrode. To ensure uniform width manually, a small flux and longer time are necessary. Moreover, it is difficult to control the width of the electrode for the randomness of manual spraying. Therefore, a new type of automatic spraying process is presented in this paper. The width and homogeneity of the electrode can be easily controlled by certain parameters of the process. Two methods for detecting the homogeneity of the electrode are introduced in this paper: Measurement of surface resistance and luminosity. The coefficient of variation (CV) values detected by the two methods are virtually equal and less than 8 %, which shows the feasibility of the detection method and homogeneity of automatic <b>spraying.</b> The <b>speed</b> of automatic <b>spraying</b> is 102  mm 2 /s, which is higher than that of manual spraying. The spraying process and the method used to detect homogeneity in this paper provide a reference for the relevant processes...|$|R
