The Germans fired 148 shells and one torpedo while Stanvac Calcutta fired only twenty-five, hundreds of machine gun rounds were also expended by both sides.|$|E

"Vienen" [...] {{was shot}} in three locations: a studio in Los Angeles, a closed down CENCO oil {{refinery}} in Santa Fe Springs, and an offshore oil platform in the Pacific Ocean {{off the coast of}} Santa Barbara. During the show's previous seasons, location manager Ilt Jones had been required to scout for locations after scripts were submitted. Starting with the eighth season, however, he was allowed to go on several [...] "scouting roadshow" [...] in order to find new and interesting locations that could be written into scripts. Jones, who discovered the oil platform and the refinery during his first scouting trip, later said the oil platform was [...] "his favorite example" [...] of places he was able to find. Because the platform and refinery were scouted in advance, Jones was given six weeks to prepare the shoota [...] "far cry" [...] from the usual two. This added time also saved the series a considerable amount of money. Filming on the oil platform occurred between sunrise and sunset in one day. The film crew used Steadicams for filming on the oil platform because the decks were <b>slick</b> <b>with</b> oil and, according to Hardy, the cameras [...] "sort of fit and blend in quite well" [...] on the platform.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{identification}} of oil slicks {{on the ocean}} surface from SAR data requires quantitative sound models accounting for the most important characteristics (ocean spectrum, slick viscosity, slick shape, and so on). In this paper we present the implementation of an innovative SAR raw signal and image simulator, which is able to reproduce images relative to ocean surfaces covered by oil <b>slicks</b> <b>with</b> arbitrary shapes. The attention is mainly focused on <b>slicks</b> <b>with</b> fractal contours. The fractal Weierstrass-Mandelbrot function is used to generate <b>slicks</b> <b>with</b> fixed fractal dimension. A box counting technique is employed to evaluate the fractal dimensions of the generated slicks and the corresponding SAR images. Radiometric properties of the area covered by oil are also estimated {{in order to show}} how the simulated data provide a powerful set for processing algorithms...|$|R

[...] Teach rallied his men and the two groups fought across the deck, which was already <b>slick</b> <b>with</b> blood from those killed or injured by Teach's broadside. [...] Maynard and Teach fired their flintlocks at each other, then threw them away. [...] Teach drew his cutlass and managed to break Maynard's sword. [...] Against superior training and a slight advantage in numbers, the pirates were pushed back toward the bow, allowing the Janes crew to surround Maynard and Teach, who was by then completely isolated. [...] As Maynard drew back to fire once again, Teach moved in to attack him, but was slashed across the neck by one of Maynard's men. [...] Badly wounded, he was then attacked and killed by several more of Maynard's crew. [...] The remaining pirates quickly surrendered. [...] Those left on the Adventure were captured by the Rangers crew, including one who planned to {{set fire to the}} powder room and blow up the ship. [...] Varying accounts exist of the battle's list of casualties; Maynard reported that8 of his men and 12pirates were killed. [...] Brand reported that 10pirates and 11of Maynard's men were killed.

2500|$|The Ratline {{experience}} culminates with Resurrection Week {{ending in}} [...] "Breakout," [...] an event where the Rats are formally [...] "welcomed" [...] to the VMI community. After the {{successful completion of}} Breakout, Rats are officially fourth class students and {{no longer have to}} strain in the barracks or eat [...] "square meals." [...] Many versions of the Breakout ceremony have been conducted. In the 1950s, Rats from each company would be packed into a corner room in the barracks and brawl their way out through the upperclassmen. From the late 1960s through the early 1980s the Rats had to fight their way up to the fourth level of the barracks through three other classes of cadets determined not to let them get to the top. The stoops would often be <b>slick</b> <b>with</b> motor oil, packed with snow, glazed with ice, greased, or continuously hosed with water. The barracks stairs and rails were not able to take the abuse, so the Corps moved the breakout to a muddy hill, where Rats attempt to climb to the top by crawling on their stomachs while the upper classes block them or drag them back down. The Rats no longer breakout in the mud but instead participate in a grueling day of physical activity testing both physical endurance and teamwork.|$|E

Full-pol and compact-pol SAR architectures allow detecting oil slicks without any adaptive thresholding, the latter is needed when dealing with dual-pol (co-co) SAR measurements.
