A proof is {{provided}} that arithmetical but not recursively enumerable sets of <b>sentences</b> definable <b>by</b> nonmonotonic <b>default</b> logic are elements of Δn+ 1 but not Σn nor Πn for some n ≥ 1 in Kleene-Mostowski hierarchy of arithmetical sets...|$|R
50|$|Eventually, {{he settled}} in Galicia, {{but did not}} give up his social and {{political}} activity. The Union of Twenty One was created on his initiative in Lwów in 1832. Around 1835 he established the Polish People’s Society in Kraków. He was the co-founder of the literary group Ziewonia. He hid under false names because the Austrian police were after him (a court in Warsaw had <b>sentenced</b> him <b>by</b> <b>default</b> to capital punishment). His stay at Podhale resulted in {{his interest in the}} culture of this region and the introduction of the Tatras into Polish literature.|$|R
50|$|In Milan, Borri {{contacted}} the Quietist milieu, {{which was very}} diffused in Lombardy and gathered itself around Saint Pelagio’s church and the prophetic charisma of Giacomo Filippo Casola, a layman {{who was accused of}} heresy by the Inquisition and shortly after died in jail. Very soon Borri became the figurehead of the Milanese movement and the fervour generated by his predication culminated in a public gathering in the square of Milan cathedral in 1658.He was prosecuted for heresy and poisoning (the latter accusation refers to his alchemical knowledge). Meanwhile, the Inquisition arrested his followers, mostly low clergymen, many of them as young and fervent as Borri.In 1659, he was called before the Roman Inquisition, while the Milanese Inquisition was still prosecuting his followers. He fled to Switzerland, was <b>sentenced</b> <b>by</b> <b>default</b> and was informed of the public abjuration of his Milanese followers.In January 1661, Borri’s effigy, after the verdict was read in public, was brought in procession to Campo de' Fiori, in Rome, the same place where, 60 years before, Giordano Bruno had been executed. Here it was hung, and burned together with the fugitive Borri's writings.|$|R
50|$|Some {{computer}} text editors, such as Emacs and vi, originally {{relied on}} double-spacing to recognize <b>sentence</b> boundaries. <b>By</b> <b>default,</b> Emacs will not break a line {{at a single}} space preceded by a period, but this behavior is configurable (with the option sentence-end-double-space). There are also functions to move the cursor forward or backward to the next double-space in the text. In Vim the joinspaces setting indicates whether extra spaces are inserted when joining lines together, and the J flag in cpoptions indicates whether a sentence must be followed by two spaces. The GNU Coding Standards recommend using two spaces when coding comments. The optional Emacs mode LaTeX provides a toggling option French-LaTeX-mode which, if set to French, creates single sentence spacing after terminal punctuation.|$|R

Teemant participated in the revolution of 1905, escaped to Switzerland in the same year and was <b>sentenced</b> to death <b>by</b> <b>default.</b> In 1908, he came back to Estonia after the end of the state of war, was in pretrial imprisonment in 1908-1909 and was sentenced to prison for one and a half years. He served the sentence in Saint Petersburg. In 1911- 1913 he was in exile in the Arkhangelsk Province.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{there has been}} {{considerable}} debate concerning the processes governing the comprehension of indeterminate sentences such as (A) Lisa began the book, and how they come {{to be understood as}} something like (B) Lisa began reading the book. A major theme in this debate concerns the role of context in facilitating comprehension. Research shows that the costs associated with processing indeterminate expressions (e. g., McElree et al., 2001) are attenuated when these <b>sentences</b> are preceded <b>by</b> a sufficiently supporting context (de Almeida, 2004). A plausible explanation for this observation is that context facilitates comprehension by activating knowledge in support of inferential processes. This view lies in contrast to the coercion hypothesis, for which indeterminate <b>sentences</b> are enriched <b>by</b> <b>default</b> as a function of retrieving internal properties of the nominal book (Pustejovsky, 1995). In the present study, we employed a discourse-based sentence recognition paradigm (Sachs, 1967), investigating whether a strongly biasing context facilitates comprehension of indeterminate sentences. Our goal was to determine whether the interpretation of indeterminate <b>sentences</b> is facilitated <b>by</b> context manipulations that tap into inferential processes rather than constituent features of the complement noun. We found that participants (N = 72) drew systematic inferences from the context {{to the extent that they}} recognized sentences such as (B) from the discourse, when in fact, they were only exposed to indeterminate sentences such as (A). These results were obtained when proposed elements of the coercion hypothesis were experimentally and statistically controlled, suggesting that context facilitates comprehension of indeterminate <b>sentences</b> <b>by</b> triggering pragmatic inferences...|$|R
