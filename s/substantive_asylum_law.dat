In the first part my work deals with a theoretical analysis of the forms of the international protection, above all with the definition of asylum and subsidiary protection, and highlights the differences between both legislations. The second chapter follows up with the analysis of certain judgements of high national courts concerning the reasons of persecution, and demonstrates different judicial approaches.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} conflict {{exists between}} the understanding of personhood in <b>asylum</b> <b>law</b> and its conception in military <b>law.</b> <b>Asylum</b> <b>law</b> in the United States and the United Kingdom recognizes homosexuality as a fundamental characteristic of personhood, which cannot be concealed. Conversely, “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell,” the statutory ban on gays serving openly in the U. S. Military, demands complete suppression of any indication of homosexuality. This Comment argues that, {{in light of the}} framework for examining personhood most recently articulated by the U. K. Supreme Court, the arguments in favor of “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” are both specious and destructive. This Comment proceeds first by examining the understanding of personhood in <b>asylum</b> <b>law.</b> It then contrasts this understanding with the demands and restrictions that “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” imposes on homosexual military personnel.

The history of asylum is very {{important}} for understanding contemporary asylum issues, however the focus of asylum historians, intense as it is, is mainly aimed at recent asylum history - in the 19 th, 20 th and 21 st centuries. The aim of the author of this thesis was to show the history of asylum in preceding times, before the Vienna Congress and the 1848 revolutions, to point out the various forms of <b>asylum</b> <b>law</b> in this era and to try to answer the question of continuity of development of <b>asylum</b> <b>law</b> in its historical context.
