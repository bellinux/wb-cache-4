25|$|The {{following}} procedure {{also works}} with additions of {{both positive and}} negative summands: One rounds one <b>summand</b> after the other the usual way, but adds the accumulated rounding error to the next <b>summand</b> before rounding it. When rounding the first number, the difference between the original number and the rounded number may be positive, negative or zero. One adds this difference to the second number before rounding it. The new (accumulated) rounding error is then— the result of the addition (before rounding)— minus the rounded second number.One continues this procedure till the last <b>summand.</b>|$|E
25|$|If all summands are positive, {{the largest}} {{remainder}} method minimizes {{the sum of}} the absolute values of the changes to the summands: Summands with large remainders are rounded up and summands with small remainders are rounded down, such that (a) no <b>summand</b> rounded down had a larger remainder than any <b>summand</b> rounded up and (b) the total remains correct.|$|E

In 1973, the young mathematician Claude Lemaréchal was surprised by his success with convex minimization methods on problems that {{were known to be}} non-convex; for minimizing nonlinear problems, a solution of the dual problem problem need not provide useful information for solving the primal problem, unless the primal problem be convex and satisfy a constraint qualification.
