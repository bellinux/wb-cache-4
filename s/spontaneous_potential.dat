The magnitude and pattern of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>potentials</b> from explants of telencephalon of 15 day chick embryos (measured using external bare platinum electrodes) and some aspects of their "normal " behavior during 12 days in vitro are also described. No change was noted in these potentials with change of amplifiers, recorders, or electrodes. The response of the potentials to change in temperature and proportionate composition of the atmosphere around the explant was such as {{to suggest that the}} potentials arise {{as a result of a}} living process. The changes brought about by the administration of anesthetics, strychnine, brucine, and barbiturates were those that might be anticipated in a normal functional activity of the central nervous system. It is concluded that these potentials are a true physiological phenomenon and arise from living cells of the central nervous system. In 1959, <b>spontaneous</b> <b>potentials</b> were first demonstrated from explants of chick cerebellum in vitro (1). These potentials differ in magnitude and time parameters from previously reported, non-spontaneous, resting, and evoked potentials in nervous tissue (9 - 13). Since 1959, qualitative observations have been made on reactions of the <b>spontaneous</b> <b>potentials</b> from explants of telencephalon of 14 and 15 day chick embryos in response to various environmental changes (14 - 16). Representative examples of further series of such observations of the effect of environmental changes on these potentials are presented in this paper.

40|$|Background: <b>Spontaneous</b> <b>potentials</b> in {{electromyography}} (EMG) of paraspinal {{muscles are}} associated with diaphragm denervation and, therefore, poor respiratory function in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is understandable. EMG changes in the rectus abdominis (RA) display an effect {{similar to those in}} paraspinal muscles with respect to the function of lower motor neurons in the thoracic spinal cord. The RA denervation was examined to determine its association with ventilation dysfunction in ALS. Methods: We collected the clinical data of 128 patients with sporadic ALS in Department of Neurology of Peking University Third Hospital from 2009 to 2013. EMG, Revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were performed in all patients and the differences in the EMG changes in RA between those with and without FVC ≥ 80 % were analysed. Results: The mean FVC value was 83. 4 % ± 17. 1 % (range: 45 %– 131 %) of the predicted value. A total of 79 patients displayed FVC ≥ 80 %, and 49 patients displayed FVC < 80 %. Compared with the patients displaying a normal FVC (60 / 79, 75. 9 %), spontaneous activity in RA was significantly different among those patients displaying an FVC < 80 % (47 / 49, 95. 9 %). In addition, <b>spontaneous</b> <b>potentials</b> in RA were more frequently detected in patients exhibiting dyspnea (32 / 33, 97. 0 %) than in patients without dyspnea (75 / 95, 78. 9 %). Conclusion: <b>Spontaneous</b> <b>potentials</b> in RA {{are associated with}} ventilation dysfunction and dyspnea in ALS patients...|$|R
50|$|<b>Spontaneous</b> <b>potential</b> can be {{measured}} by placing one probe of a voltmeter at the Earth's surface (called surface electrode) and the other probe in the borehole (called downhole electrode), where the SP is to {{be measured}}. In fact, logging tools employ exactly this method. Since this measurement is relatively simple, usually SP downhole electrode is built into other logging tools.|$|E
50|$|The <b>spontaneous</b> <b>potential</b> log, {{commonly}} called the self potential log or SP log, is a passive measurement taken by oil industry well loggers to characterise rock formation properties. The log works by measuring small electric potentials (measured in millivolts) between depths in the borehole and a grounded electrode at the surface. Conductive bore hole fluids {{are necessary to}} create a SP response, so the SP log cannot be used in nonconductive drilling muds (e.g. oil-based mud) or air filled holes.|$|E
50|$|In 1931, Henri George Doll and G. Dechatre, {{working for}} Schlumberger, {{discovered}} that the galvanometer wiggled even when no current was being passed through the logging cables down in the well. This led {{to the discovery of}} the <b>spontaneous</b> <b>potential</b> (SP) which was as important as the ability to measure resistivity. The SP effect was produced naturally by the borehole mud at the boundaries of permeable beds. By simultaneously recording SP and resistivity, loggers could distinguish between permeable oil-bearing beds and impermeable nonproducing beds.|$|E

40|$|The ventral lateral neurons (LNvs) {{of adult}} Drosophila brain express {{oscillating}} clock proteins and regulate circadian behavior. Whole cell current-clamp recordings of large LNvs in freshly dissected Drosophila whole brain preparations reveal two spontaneous activity patterns that correlate with two underlying patterns of oscillating membrane potential: tonic and burst firing of sodium-dependent action potentials. Resting membrane <b>potential</b> and <b>spontaneous</b> action <b>potential</b> firing are rapidly and reversibly regulated by acute changes in light intensity. The LNv electrophysiological light response is attenuated, but not abolished, in cry(b) mutant flies hypomorphic for the cell-autonomous light-sensing protein CRYPTOCHROME.

40|$|<b>Spontaneous</b> action <b>potentials</b> {{have been}} {{described}} in developing sensory systems. These rhythmic activities may have instructional roles for the functional development of synaptic connections. The importance of <b>spontaneous</b> action <b>potentials</b> in the developing auditory system is underpinned by the stark correlation between the time of auditory system functional maturity, and the cessation of <b>spontaneous</b> action <b>potentials.</b> A prominent K + current that regulates patterning of action potentials is IA. This current undergoes marked changes in expression during chicken hair cell development. Although the properties of IA are not normally classified as Ca 2 +-dependent, we demonstrate that throughout the development of chicken hair cells, I A is greatly reduced by acute alterations of intracellular Ca 2 +. As determinants of spike timing and firing frequency, intracellular Ca 2 + buffers shift the activation and inactivation properties of the current to more positive potentials. Our findings provide evidence {{to demonstrate that the}} kinetics and functional expression of IA are tightly regulated by intracellular Ca 2 +. Such feedback mechanism between the functional expression of IA and intracellular Ca 2 + may shape the activity of <b>spontaneous</b> action <b>potentials,</b> thus potentially sculpting synaptic connections in an activitydependent manner in the developing cochlea...|$|R
50|$|A {{variety of}} {{electric}} methods {{are used in}} geophysical survey. Some measure <b>spontaneous</b> <b>potential,</b> a potential that arises in the ground because of man-made or natural disturbances. Telluric currents flow in Earth and the oceans. They have two causes: electromagnetic induction by the time-varying, external-origin geomagnetic field and motion of conducting bodies (such as seawater) across the Earth's permanent magnetic field. The distribution of telluric current density {{can be used to}} detect variations in electrical resistivity of underground structures. Geophysicists can also provide the electric current themselves (see induced polarization and electrical resistivity tomography).|$|E
50|$|<b>Spontaneous</b> <b>potential</b> (SP), {{also called}} self potential, is a {{naturally}} occurring {{electric potential difference}} in the Earth, measured by an electrode relative to a fixed reference electrode. Spontaneous potentials are often measured down boreholes for formation evaluation in {{the oil and gas}} industry, and they can also be measured along the Earth's surface for mineral exploration or groundwater investigation. The phenomenon and its application to geology was first recognized by Conrad Schlumberger, Marcel Schlumberger, and E.G. Leonardon in 1931, and the first published examples were from Romanian oil fields.|$|E
50|$|Streaming {{potential}} originates {{from the}} flow of an electrolyte (water) over naturally charged solids (i.e., surfaces that acquired electrokinetic or zeta potential). The streaming potential appears when mud filtrate is forced into the formation under the differential pressure between mud column and formation. The streaming potential is produced when the flow takes place across mud-cake in front of permeable formations, across permeable formations being invaded, and across shale beds. It is generally accepted that the streaming potential across the mud-cake is compensated by that across the shale. As such, in most cases, the <b>spontaneous</b> <b>potential</b> measured is only related to the electrochemical potential.|$|E

40|$|Patch-clamp {{techniques}} {{were used in}} primary cultures of rat lactotropes and the rat pituitary clonal cell line GH 3 to determine the population characteristics of <b>spontaneous</b> action <b>potentials</b> {{and the nature of}} the currents responsible for repolarization of <b>spontaneous</b> action <b>potentials.</b> <b>Spontaneous</b> action <b>potentials</b> were observed in 75 % of lactotropes (74 / 99) and 80 % of GH 3 cells (42 / 51). Lactotropes exhibited broad and shallow action potentials (average duration 460 ms, peak - 17 mV, slope of upstroke 0. 5 mV/ms) compared to the GH 3 cells which displayed narrow and tall action potentials (average duration 177 ms, peak - 10 mV, slope of upstroke 1. 6 mV/ms). Blockers of potassium currents were used to determine the role of specific potassium currents in the repolarization process. <b>Spontaneous</b> action <b>potentials</b> in lactotropes were largely unaffected by 4 -aminopyridine (4 AP), charybdotoxin, and apamin. Tetraethylammonium (TEA) caused only an small increase in peak amplitude and, in a subset of cells, a small increase in duration. In contrast, in GH 3 cells, TEA, 4 AP, charybdotoxin, and apamin all caused a significant increase in duration, while TEA and charybdotoxin also caused an increase in peak amplitude. Further, apamin caused a positive shift in the afterhyperpolarization voltage. In lactotropes, strong buffering of intracellular calcium with calcium chelators (EGTA or BAPTA) caused a profound increase in action potential duration. Thus, repolarization of action potentials in lactotropes is a calcium-dependent process, but unlike GH 3 cells, is not mediated by calcium-dependent potassium currents, nor is it strongly influenced by voltage-dependent potassium currents...|$|R

50|$|Streaming {{currents}} in well-defined geometries are a sensitive method {{to characterize the}} zeta potential of surfaces, which {{is important in the}} fields of colloid and interface science. In geology, measurements of related <b>spontaneous</b> <b>potential</b> are used for evaluations of formations. Streaming potential has to be considered in design for flow of poorly conductive fluids (e.g., gasoline lines) because of the danger of buildup of high voltages. The streaming current monitor (SCM) is a fundamental tool for monitoring coagulation in wastewater treatment plants. The degree of coagulation of raw water may be monitored by the use of an SCM to provide a positive feedback control of coagulant injection. As the streaming current of the wastewater increases, more coagulant agent is injected into the stream. The higher levels of coagulant agent cause the small colloidal particles to coagulate and sediment out of the stream. Since less colloid particles are in the wastewater stream, the streaming potential decreases. The SCM recognizes this and subsequently reduces the amount of coagulant agent injected into the wastewater stream. The implementation of SCM feedback control has led to a significant materials cost reduction, one that was not realized until the early 1980s. In addition to monitoring capabilities, the streaming current could, in theory, generate usable electrical power. This process, however, has yet to be applied as typical streaming potential mechanical to electrical efficiencies are around 1%.|$|E
40|$|<b>Spontaneous</b> <b>potential</b> well-logging is an {{important}} technique to detect {{the parameters of the}} formation in petroleum exploitation. In this paper, we want to identify the <b>spontaneous</b> <b>potential</b> caused on the interfaces of different layers.

Furthermore, membrane potential measurements during the first 80 milliseconds (ms) following microelectrode penetration of the cell membrane usually show no decay. There is also good agreement between values of cell membrane resistance obtained by the microelectrode technique, the whole cell patch clamp technique, and the single channel patch clamp technique. These results indicate that our microelectrode measurements are not dominated by leak-induced artifacts, and that the <b>spontaneous</b> membrane <b>potential</b> activity is not induced by Ca 2 + leakage around the microelectrode. The <b>spontaneous</b> membrane <b>potential</b> activity is eliminated {{in the presence of}} the Ca 2 + ionophore A 23187, also in serum-free medium, and by K+ and Ca 2 + channel blockers, but it is not affected by the hyperpolarizing responses to parathyroid hormone (PTH) and dibutyryl cAMP, which persist under all of these conditions.
