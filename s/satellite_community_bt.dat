50|$|This annual {{gathering}} {{provides a}} forum for the best minds in the small <b>satellite</b> <b>community</b> to review recent successes, explore new directions, and introduce emerging technologies in small spacecraft development. In addition to creating an excellent environment for networking and speaking with experts in military, science, and academic fields, the Conference offers a program of international relevance, focusing on the key challenges and opportunities facing the small <b>satellite</b> <b>community</b> today.|$|R
40|$|SpaceX is revolutionizing {{access to}} {{space for the}} <b>satellite</b> <b>community</b> by {{providing}} highly reliable, low cost launch services. To this end, SpaceX has developed a family of orbital transportation solutions and aims to reduce the price of launch services by an order of magnitude. The small <b>satellite</b> <b>community</b> {{is critical to the}} future of our industry. SpaceX is committed to providing reliable, timely, and cost-effective launch services and will continue to innovate in this capacity. An overview of these efforts and how they will positively impact the small <b>satellite</b> <b>community</b> are discussed. In 2010, SpaceX conducted two consecutive successful launches of its Falcon 9 launch vehicle and Dragon spacecraft, proving their capability and becoming the first commercial company to ever return a private spacecraft from orbit. Initial analysis shows Dragon will be reusable – an important factor in reducing long term costs of access to space. In addition to the near-perfect missions of this medium-class launcher and cargo transportation system, great strides were made for the small <b>satellite</b> <b>community...</b>|$|R

40|$|Arbuscular {{mycorrhizal}} fungi (AMF) are a {{group of}} obligate plant symbionts which can promote plant nutrition. AMF communities are diverse, but the factors which control their assembly {{in space and time}} remain unclear. In this study, the contributions of geographical distance, environmental heterogeneity and time in shaping AMF communities associated with Miscanthus giganteus (a perennial grass originating from south-east Asia) were determined over a 13 months period. In particular, the community was partitioned into core (abundant and persistent taxa) and satellite (taxa with low abundance and persistence) constituents and the drivers of community assembly for each determined. β-diversity was exceptionally low across the 140 m line transects, and there was limited evidence of geographical scaling effects on the composition of the core, <b>satellite</b> or combined <b>communities.</b> However, AMF richness and community composition changed over time associated with fluctuation within both the core and <b>satellite</b> <b>communities.</b> The degree to which AMF community variation was explained by soil properties was consistently higher in the core community than the combined and <b>satellite</b> <b>communities,</b> suggesting that the <b>satellite</b> <b>community</b> had considerable stochasticity associated with it. We suggest that the partitioning of communities into their core and satellite constituents could be employed to enhance the variation explained within microbial community analyses...|$|R

25|$|The Jarabarriu, {{the final}} stage of the Chavín Horizon, lasted from about 400 to 250 BCE. Chavín culture had a {{dramatic}} increase in population. The settlement pattern changed to a proto-urban pattern, consisting of a center of lowland valley peoples and smaller <b>satellite</b> <b>communities</b> in the surrounding higher altitude areas. The culture showed specialization and social differentiation. The people who lived in the east at Chavín de Huantar are thought to have had lower prestige than the communities around the ceremonial center. A diverse and intense production of ceramics is suggested during the Jarabarriu phase, when the valley was heavily populated and the ceramic style more defined. <b>Satellite</b> <b>communities</b> also developed centers of production during this phase.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} meet the cost goals of small satellites, {{attitude}} determination and control problems must be solved using standardized components. Small satellite attitude control systems must feature performance, versatility, and above all, low cost Large, custom designed, high cost attitude control systems have no place in the small <b>satellite</b> <b>community.</b> A modular concept of attitude control is presented which will allow ambitious performance and cost goals to be attained. Basic building blocks allow mission specific goals to be reached with a minimum of effort and expense. Several basic modules are described and applied to a number of representative mission requirements.
