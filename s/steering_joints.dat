50|$|Four {{wheel drive}} for heavy {{vehicles}} {{in this period}} was difficult and the Hathi used a complex arrangement of bevel gears to transmit drive through the <b>steering</b> <b>joints</b> of the front axle. Rather than the common system of articulated drive shafts to the front hubs (the shaft either inside an axle casing or external), fixed shafts were used. Shafts inside the axle casing carried power {{to the ends of}} the axle, then a bevel gear drove a short vertical shaft running through the steering kingpin. A further bevel on the outer part of the hub carrier (the part moving with the steering) drove the hub itself.|$|E

40|$|Fault-tolerant {{control design}} of wheeled {{planetary}} rovers is described. This paper covers all {{steps of the}} design process, from modeling/simulation to experimentation. A simplified contact model is used with a multibody simulation model and tuned to fit the experimental data. The nominal mode controller {{is designed to be}} stable and has its parameters optimized to improve tracking performance and cope with physical boundaries and actuator saturations. This controller was implemented in the real rover and validated experimentally. An impact analysis defines the repertory of faults to be handled. Failures in <b>steering</b> <b>joints</b> are chosen as fault modes; they combined six fault modes and a total of 63 possible configurations of these faults. The fault-tolerant controller is designed as a two-step procedure to provide alternative steering and reuse the nominal controller in a way that resembles a crab-like driving mode. Three fault modes are injected (one, two, and three failed <b>steering</b> <b>joints)</b> in the real rover to evaluate the response of the nonreconfigured and reconfigured control systems in face of these faults. The experimental results justify our proposed fault-tolerant controller very satisfactorily. Additional concluding comments and an outlook summarize the lessons learned during the whole design process and foresee the next steps of the research...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present new {{locomotion}} and steering modules conceived and designed for rescue serpentine robots with enhanced climbing ability. The locomotion modules apply sock locomotion technology that allows great motion efficiency in rubble and confined environment due to the very high propulsion ratio. The <b>steering</b> <b>joints</b> guarantee good orientation dexterity by exploiting actuation based on smart materials. Design/methodology/approach: Great attention and time is dedicated to the design phase, digital mock-upping and virtual comparative assessment of different solutions. Mechatronic interdisciplinary design methodology including mechanisms analysis, sensory actuation issues and functional materials characterization, control and communication integration has been adopted. Findings: The locomotion modules are revised and updated versions improving climbing ability of the socked locomotion module originally proposed by the authors. New steering modules with high orientation workspace, based on smart actuation, are introduced. Research limitations/implications: The evaluation of the findings on the field is planned but no experimental result is today available. Practical implications: Agile serpentine robots are requested for quick and safe rescue and special risky interventions in environments where dense vegetation, rubble and confined spaces prevent human presence. These robots offer invaluable potential help in such risky interventions mainly by being agile in exploring the environment, robust, low cost, reliable, and tele-operated. Originality/value: The paper presents original issues in terms of concept and design of instrumental (locomotion and steering) modules for composing modular rescue robots with very high locomotion agility and climbing performances...|$|E

The control law is designed by Lyapunov techniques and relies on the equations of the robot in polar coordinates. A set of experiments {{have been carried out}} to show the performance of the proposed approach.
