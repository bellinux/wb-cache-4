500|$|The Washington Posts Dan Zak {{wrote that}} the film fails to provide laughs, scares, suspense, or gore. Zak also said it fails to provide the {{exhibition}} of nudity expected of horror films that cannot deliver on the previously listed criteria. Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times said Nispel captured the despair he created with his Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake. Olsen also said the film failed to provide the [...] "giddiness", [...] "teenage lust", and [...] "rambunctiousness" [...] that made the previous Friday the 13th films work. Wesley Morris <b>said</b> <b>Friday</b> the 13th did have humor; he said the characters continually act the clichéd role of would-be-victim, {{making it hard to}} fear for their safety. In his opinion, the 2009 film lacked the [...] "psycho-social" [...] aspecta mother killing out of revenge for her son's deathcrafted by its 1980 predecessor, and ultimately the film is [...] "more hilarious than terrifying".|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} to the film's detractors, The New York Times's Nathan Lee <b>said</b> <b>Friday</b> the 13th managed to [...] "reboot the concept" [...] of the original films with style. Lee said the film takes pleasure in killing off each of its characters, {{that there is a}} desire among cinemagoers for this type of material, and that Friday the 13th satisfies that desire. Adam Graham from The Detroit News said the film is the most effective and scary film in the Friday the 13th series; he praised its choice of allowing Jason to run after his victimsas opposed to slowly walking behind them, as became prominent in later sequelsbecause it made him more menacing. Graham also said the film does not [...] "soften" [...] Jason's scariness by providing a sympathetic backstory. Entertainment Weeklys Clark Collis said director Nispel made a competent film that performs better as a whole than the previously released remakes of Prom Night (2008) and My Bloody Valentine 3D (2009), although it does provide a few too many unbelievable character moments.|$|E

2500|$|At a {{press conference}} held on August 7, Rodriguez {{announced}} that he would play in his final game for the Yankees on the following Friday, August 12, against the Rays at Yankee Stadium. It was also noted that the Yankees would sign him to a new contract that would keep him in the organization through 2017 as a special instructor and advisor. In the offseason, Rodriguez would join the Yankees' front office as a special advisor. [...] The club commemorated Rodriguez' final game as a Yankee, thanking him in front of a sold-out crowd for his efforts with a tribute of highlights on the stadium videoboard, a presentation of a framed number 13 jersey and a base autographed by teammates. This was {{in stark contrast to the}} year-long farewell tour given to his former Yankee teammate Derek Jeter. At the plate, he batted third and started as the DH, going 1-for-4 with an RBI double. In the ninth inning, he was brought onto the field at third base for one batter − his only defensive appearance for the Yankees in 2016 − and departed the field to a [...] "raucous ovation" [...] from the fans. [...] The next day, the Yankees granted him his unconditional release. On August 15, many rumors traveled around the majors. The Miami Marlins were interested in signing him to play first base until his spokesman Ron Berkowitz emailed the media and said on behalf of Rodriguez, “I want to put all this talk to rest about Alex playing for any team this season. It’s not happening. Like he <b>said</b> <b>Friday</b> night, he is happy and he is going to take some time to relax and hang with his family and friends.” Rodriguez ended the season playing 65 games with a [...]200 batting average, 9 home runs and 31 RBIs.|$|E

[...] "To be sure, Friday," [...] said I, [...] "God is more wise and {{stronger}} than the serpent: he is above the devil, which makes us pray to him, that he would tread down Satan under his feet, enable us to resist the violent temptations; and quench his fiery darts."

6000|$|The {{manner of}} their cruelties to one another, which consequently, as I thought, must be acted with greater barbarity to strangers, created in {{me a great}} anxiety, and made me still more curious to ask Friday {{concerning}} them. He told me, he was sure they still lived there, having resided among them above four years, and that the savages gave them victuals to live upon: [...] "But pray, Friday," [...] said I, [...] "whence proceeded all this good nature and generosity? How came it to pass {{that they did not}} kill and eat them, to please their devouring appetites, and occasion to splendid an entertainment among them?" [...] No, no, <b>said</b> <b>Friday,</b> they not kilt 'em, they make brothers with 'em; by which I understood there was a truce between them. And then I had a more favourable opinion of the Indians, upon Friday uttering these words, My nation, t'other nation no eat man, but when mans, make war fight: as though he had said, that neither those of his kingdom, nor any other nations that he knew of, ever ate their fellow-creatures, but such as their law of arms allowed to be devoured; that is, those miserable captives, whose misfortune it should be to be made prisoners of war.|$|E

He coloured inordinately when Duncan Campbell <b>said</b> <b>Friday,</b> and conjured him to tell him as particularly as he could {{what he meant by}} Friday. He told him he could not particularise any farther, but that great danger threatened him that day; and that without extraordinary precaution it would prove fatal to him, even to death. He shook his head, and went away in a very sorrowful plight. Friday past, Saturday came, and on that very Saturday morning came likewise the joyful tidings, that what ventures of his were given over for lost at sea, were all come safe into the harbour. He came the moment he received those dispatches from his agent, to Mr. Duncan Campbell's apartment, embraced him tenderly, and saluted him with much gladness of heart, before a great roomful of ladies, where I happened to be present at that time; crying out in a loud voice, before he knew what he said, that Mr. Campbell had saved his life, that Friday was his birthday, and he had intended with a pistol to shoot himself that very day. The ladies thought him mad; and he, recovered from his ecstacy, said no more, but sat down, till Mr. Campbell dismissed all his clients; and then we three went to the tavern together, where he told me the whole little history or narrative, just as is above related.|$|E
