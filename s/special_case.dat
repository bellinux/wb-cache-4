5|$|The {{result that}} 0.999... = 1 generalizes readily in two ways. First, every nonzero number with a finite decimal {{notation}} (equivalently, endless trailing 0s) has a counterpart with trailing 9s. For example, 0.24999... equals 0.25, exactly {{as in the}} <b>special</b> <b>case</b> considered. These numbers are exactly the decimal fractions, and they are dense.|$|E

Located in the same stage as the show's taping facility, this hall of fame features memorabilia related to Wheels syndicated history, including retired props, classic merchandise, photographs, videos, and a <b>special</b> <b>case</b> dedicated to White's wardrobe. Two years later, in 2012, the show was honored with a Ride of Fame on a double decker tour bus in New York City.|$|E

5|$|A <b>special</b> <b>case</b> {{of natural}} {{selection}} is sexual selection, which is selection for any trait that increases mating success by increasing the attractiveness of an organism to potential mates. Traits that evolved through sexual selection are particularly prominent among males of several animal species. Although sexually favoured, traits such as cumbersome antlers, mating calls, large body size and bright colours often attract predation, which compromises the survival of individual males. This survival disadvantage is balanced by higher reproductive success in males that show these hard-to-fake, sexually selected traits.|$|E
5|$|Apollonius' {{problem can}} be {{extended}} to construct all the circles that intersect three given circles at a precise angle θ, or at three specified crossing angles θ1, θ2 and θ3; the ordinary Apollonius' problem corresponds to a <b>special</b> <b>case</b> in which the crossing angle is zero for all three given circles. Another generalization is the dual of the first extension, namely, to construct circles with three specified tangential distances from the three given circles.|$|E
5|$|Graphs and {{directed}} graphs {{can be viewed}} as a <b>special</b> <b>case</b> of the far more general notion called relational structures (defined as a set with a tuple of relations on it). Directed graphs are structures with a single binary relation (adjacency) on the domain (the vertex set). Under this view, homomorphisms of such structures are exactly graph homomorphisms.|$|E

30|$|As {{mentioned}} in Section  1, the (EP) contains many optimization related problems as <b>special</b> <b>cases.</b> Therefore, we derive {{the continuity of}} the results of Section  3 for such <b>special</b> <b>cases.</b> In this section, we give applications to constrained minimization problems and Nash-equilibrium problems.|$|R
5|$|If {{the three}} given circles are {{mutually}} tangent, Apollonius' problem has five solutions. Three solutions are the given circles themselves, since each is tangent to itself {{and to the}} other two given circles. The remaining two solutions (shown in red in Figure12) correspond to the inscribed and circumscribed circles, and are called Soddy's circles. This <b>special</b> <b>case</b> of Apollonius' problem is also known as the four coins problem. The three given circles of this Apollonius problem form a Steiner chain tangent to the two Soddy's circles.|$|E
5|$|In {{computer}} science, 2-satisfiability, 2-SAT or just 2SAT is a computational {{problem of}} assigning values to variables, {{each of which}} has two possible values, in order to satisfy a system of constraints on pairs of variables. It is a <b>special</b> <b>case</b> of the general Boolean satisfiability problem, which can involve constraints on more than two variables, and of constraint satisfaction problems, which can allow more than two choices for the value of each variable. But in contrast to those more general problems, which are NP-complete, 2-satisfiability can be solved in polynomial time.|$|E
5|$|In the {{weighted}} maximum clique problem, the input is an undirected graph with weights on its vertices (or, less frequently, edges) and the output is a clique with maximum total weight. The maximum clique {{problem is the}} <b>special</b> <b>case</b> in which all weights are equal. As well as the problem of optimizing the sum of weights, other more complicated bicriterion optimization problems have also been studied.|$|E

5|$|Spirals {{are common}} in plants and in some animals, notably molluscs. For example, in the nautilus, a {{cephalopod}} mollusc, each chamber of its shell is an approximate copy of the next one, scaled by a constant factor and arranged in a logarithmic spiral.

5|$|The {{concept of}} a Taylor series was {{formulated}} by the Scottish mathematician James Gregory and formally introduced by the English mathematician Brook Taylor in 1715.

The ground out is technically a <b>special</b> <b>case</b> of the force out.|$|E
