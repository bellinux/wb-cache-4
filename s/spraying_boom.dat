The control of western corn rootworm is difficult due to {{the height of the}} corn crop in July-August. The current paper presents the exploitation characteristics of mistblower with cannon and field sprayer with high-mounted <b>spraying</b> <b>boom</b> and vertical tube extension with distributing nozzles on pesticide distribution over the corn plant. Design/methodology/approach: Two field experiments with different air adjustments and driving speed (mistblower with cannon) and nozzle flow and driving speed (field sprayer with high-mounted <b>spraying</b> <b>boom)</b> were reserachFindings: The ventilator of the mistblower spread the pesticide over the wider band of the field as the field sprayer, however the pesticide distribution measured as coefficient of variation did not fulfil the legislative requirements. Research limitations/implications: The experiment results presented herein can be applied under similar equipment adjustment, working speed and growing conditions of the corn plant (78. 000 / ha and the height of 2. 70 m). Practical implications: The field sprayer with high-mounted <b>spraying</b> <b>boom</b> and vertical tube extension was proved as an efficient machine for controlling of western corn rootworm adults in the developed corn growing over 2. 70 m. With the presented technical procedure the damage caused by the western corn rootworm can be almost completely prevented. However due to the growing stage of the plant in the time of spreading of the adult, about 6. 5 % of the plants are overriddenOriginality/value: By implementing the findings from our experiments a severe damage in corn yield caused by the western corn rootworm can be reduced significantly.

40|$|ABSTRACT The <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> {{is one of}} {{the sprayer}} {{components}} that most affect the application quality and may cause phytotoxicity and overlay application problems. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the displacement in the vertical and horizontal movements of the <b>spray</b> <b>booms</b> in three models of self-propelled boom sprayers. The vibrations of the <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> in the vertical direction was measured using three receivers (GNSS) with RTK differential correction.

Distribution {{pattern of}} <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> in fields is {{affected}} by several parameters {{which one of the}} important reasons is horizontal and vertical vibrations because of unevenness surfaces. <b>Spray</b> <b>boom</b> movements lead to decrease of spread efficiency and crop yield. Generally, active suspension is employed to control and attenuate the vibration of sprayer booms because these suspensions reduce the high frequency vibration of <b>spray</b> <b>booms</b> thanks to irregularities soil. In this research, a proportional-integral-derivative controller with active force control is used to remove undesired rolling of <b>spray</b> <b>boom.</b> Simulation results depict that the proposed scheme is more effective and accurate than PID control only scheme.

Nevertheless, improvement of upcoming method for soil cultured greenhouse has not been sufficiently achieved. Geometrical complexity of ground in protected crop cultivation might be one {{of the most}} dominant factors in design of autonomous vehicle. While there is a practical solution fairly enough to promise an accurate travelling, such as autonomous sprayer guided by rail or induction coil, for various reasons including the limitation of producer’s budget, the previously developed sprayer has not been widely distributed to market. Methods: In this study, we developed an autonomous sprayer considering travelling performance on geometrical complexity of ground in soil cultured greenhouse. To maintain a stable travelling and to acquire a real time feedback, common wire with 80 mm thick and body frame and sprayer boom. To evaluate performance of the prototype, tracking performance, climbing performance and spraying boom’s uniform leveling performance were individually evaluated by corresponding experimental tests.

40|$|Off-target {{drift of}} {{chemical}} from agricultural spraying can damage sensitive crops, destroy beneficial insects, and intrude on human and domestic animal habitats, threatening environmental quality. Reduction of drift from aerial application can be facilitated {{at the edge}} of a field by offsetting spray ½ or 1 boom width from the field edge or by switching off one boom. For single boom application (and especially when spraying in a cross wind), there is some question whether off-target drift of sprayed crop protection agent is influenced by which boom is spraying and if direction of propeller rotation has any effect. An experiment was conducted to determine the effect of propeller wash rotation on aerial spray drift from turbine-powered aircraft. Spray samplers were placed at three sample lines to collect drift fallout and air-entrained particles 104, 134, 195, and 317 meters downwind, perpendicular to the flight path. An aqueous mixture of malathion was applied from the aircraft through fifty hollow cone nozzles. Five total replications were conducted over two days. Each replication had four treatment combinations of actively <b>spraying</b> <b>boom</b> and airplane direction. Results showed that neither active boom nor boom location (upwind or downwind) was statistically significant for either sampling method at the 0. 05 level. Blocking the study to account for weather differences increased statistical precision. Thus when analysis was limited to the second day of testing, propeller wash direction was significant at the 0. 10 level for the fallout sheets (P = 0. 0773), and at the 0. 05 level for high volume (Hi-Vol) air samplers (P = 0. 0200). Higher concentrations occurred when propeller wash spiraled downwind. Based on results of this study, recommendations for pilots spraying with a single boom near a boundary is to spray so that propeller wash rotation occurs upwind. </p...|$|E

In this study, the effect of some parameters on the size of deposited particles on non-target areas was studied using statistical method. The effects of nozzle type (orifice size), spraying pressure, <b>spraying</b> <b>boom</b> height and wind speed as effective factors on drift were examined. A horizontal wind tunnel with working section of 0. 47 m wide, 0. 75 m height and 5. 5 m long was used for testing.

40|$|In This Issue: HERBICIDE APPLICATION Weed {{control with}} {{herbicides}} {{depends on the}} uniform application of dependable herbicides. A sprayer is needed which will allow for both uniform application and correct droplet size at desired spray volumes. The sprayer should be of sufficient capacity to handle the acreage involved. AGITATION Agitation of most spray solutions is necessary. Any separation will vary the spray concentration. For a simple orifice jet agitator, a flow of 6 gallons per minute for every 100 gallons of tank capacity is usually adequate. SPRAY BOOMS The use of gauge wheels helps maintain the proper distance between the spray nozzle and the target especially on uneven ground, going across terraces, etc. A <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> where the height and angle of the spray nozzles can be changed is also desirable. The supply lines to and on the <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> must be of adequate size for even distribution. It is best to have the supply line coming {{to the center of}} the <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> section and distribute from that point rather than coming in on the end of the <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> and running the chance of less pressure at the far end. Many sprayers, now, are being designed with wet booms and are fitted with assemblies that protrude 1 / 3 to 1 / 2 way into the boom which take the spray solution out of the middle of the boom. PVC Schedule 80 makes an excellent wet boom if supported adequately. The wet boom, which takes the spray solution from the middle, will help keep materials like sand and rust in the bottom of the <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> which can be flushed out of the end of the <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> when it is cleaned.

Yet, <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> systems-instead of the still predominantly used spray guns-might improve crop protection management in greenhouses considerably. Application rate, nozzle type, and configuration will influence the spray deposition and, as such, its efficiency. In this study, spray deposition in ivy pot plants [Hedera algeriensis cv. Montgomery, Hibb. ], grown on hanging shelves in greenhouses, was compared with a traditional spray gun with a disc-core nozzle and a manually pulled trolley equipped with two vertical <b>spray</b> <b>booms.</b> The sprayings with the spray gun were performed at an application rate of 8500 L. ha(- 1). For the vertical <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> system, two different reduced application rates (2500 and 5000 L. ha(- 1)) with five different combinations of nozzle type, size, and pressure for each application rate were investigated. This research underlined that, besides the application rate, also the spray application equipment used has an important effect on the spray depositions. Nozzle type, size, and pressure on the vertical <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> system only had a minor effect on the spray deposition. Although the spray gun performed well on the easily accessible crop zone with the runners, its performance in the more dense main crop zone was inferior. With 240 % more sprayed liquid (8500 L. ha(- 1)) and chemicals, the realized depositions in this crop zone were not significantly different from the ones obtained with the vertical <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> system applying only 2500 L. ha(- 1).

The method previously developed by Luck et al. (2009) was used to calculate coverage areas for the control sections along the <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> in MS Excel. Nozzle discharge flow rates were estimated from the nozzle pressure data (based on manufacturer calibration information) which was then incorporated into MS Excel to determine the rate of pesticide applied to the fields. Results indicate the majority of each field received application rates at or below the target rate. Only 34. 2 %, 33. 9 %, and 22. 9 % of Fields 1, 2, and 4, respectively, received application rates at the target rate +/- 10 % during these postemergence treatments. The goal of this project was develop distribution maps {{to better understand the}} effects of boom section control and turning movements on herbicide accumulation...|$|R
40|$|The study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the performance of air assistance in <b>spray</b> <b>booms</b> using different types of nozzles and spray volumes. We took into account spray deposits, fall armyworm control and crop corn performance in a narrow row cropping system. The experiment was carried out at the experimental area of Sao Paulo State University, Botucatu/SP, Brazil, during the 2008 / 2009 agricultural season, in randomized blocks with a factorial scheme (2 × 2 + 1) and four replications. Two spray nozzles (flat fan nozzle and hollow cone nozzle) were tested, combined with two air assistance levels in the <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> (with and without air assistance) and a treatment control. In the experimental spraying, Spinosad insecticide was sprayed in amounts of 48 g active substance (a. s.) /ha. The air assistance in the <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> increased the <b>spray</b> deposits in the V 4 growth stage of the corn plants. Moreover, the application of this technology showed higher efficiency on fall armyworm control, reaching a 100 % level 15 days after spraying, in the V 10 growth stage of the plants. The hollow cone nozzle increased the spray deposit level on the corn plants compared with the flat fan nozzle, at growth stage V 4. However, the flat fan nozzle, combined with air assistance technology, was more effective for controlling fall armyworm in the same growth stage (V 4), although the hollow cone nozzle increased the deposit levels on the plants. All the technologies tested in the study promoted a reduction of plant damage from fall armyworm attack. Corn productivity {{is directly related to}} the control efficiency of fall armyworm...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{a hybrid}} {{model of a}} <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> with cable {{suspension}} is developed. It combines an analytical modelling procedure with identification techniques {{to cope with the}} limited power in the excitation actuator. The analytical model was used to optimize the passive boom suspension, while the identification part {{is the first step in}} the design of a slow active suspension.

40|$|In {{a series}} of indoor {{experiments}} spray drift potential was assessed when spraying over a spray drift testbench with two different driving speeds, 2 m/s and 4 m/s, two different <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> heights, 30 cm and 50 cm, and two different nozzle spacing, 25 cm and 50 cm, for six different nozzle types. The nozzles types used were the standard flat fan XR as a reference nozzle and the DG, XLTD, IDN, AIXR and AIRmix as drift reducing nozzles types. A Patternator was used to check the cross distribution for the different nozzle types and settings. Spraying tests were carried out by adding the fluorescent dye Brilliant Sulfo Flavine to the spray agent. Potential spray drift deposition was measured placing collectors along the testbench quantifying the deposition of the spray plume behind the moving <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> in windstill conditions. Results obtained from two laboratories set ups differ because of the variability of relative humidity in one laboratory. Spray drift reducing capability can be different at different settings depending on the nozzle type...|$|R
40|$|This paper validates the {{discrete}} element {{method for}} linear flexible multibody systems, elaborated in Part 1 of the paper, {{of which the}} flexible bodies are a composition of flexible beams. An automatic procedure is developed to convert the linear equations of motion of a multibody system from force to displacement input. By this procedure, support motions and displacements of actuators between the bodies can be employed as an input to the system. Furthermore, using this procedure, the methodology explained in Part 1, which was valid for tree structured systems can be extended to systems containing closed kinematic chains. The methodology of Part 1 is applied for the discrete and finite element approximations to model the horizontal behaviour of an agricultural <b>spray</b> <b>boom.</b> As the inputs to the <b>spray</b> <b>boom</b> are known under the form of positions, the equations of motions are converted from force to position inputs. The discrete and finite element approximations are compared based on accuracy and {{the complexity of the}} resulting models. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R
