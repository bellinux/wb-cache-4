25|$|On 4 February 2005 he {{committed}} his future to Cardiff City, signing a new long-term {{contract with the}} club. This was shortly after he had won a call up to the Wales under-21 squad. A month later he scored a vital goal, to earn three points for Cardiff as they beat Sheffield United 1–0. Ledley's season ended in April as he suffered a fractured metatarsal bone in training. Before this he had played 32 times for Cardiff City and had also earned three Wales under-21 caps. His performances had provided a major boost for Cardiff City in what was a poor season for them {{as they were in}} relegation trouble {{at the bottom of the}} Championship and were suffering financial troubles as well. Lawrence said that he hoped Ledley would stay at Cardiff for the next few seasons and that he wouldn't be <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> 18-year-old earned a full Wales call-up in the near future.|$|E

500|$|Taylor {{made his}} NFL regular season debut on September 6, 1981, in a 24–10 {{loss to the}} Philadelphia Eagles. Aside from {{incurring}} a penalty for a late hit on Eagles running back Perry Harrington, Taylor played a nondescript game. In a game versus the St. Louis Cardinals later in the season, Taylor rushed and sacked the passer when {{he was supposed to}} drop into coverage. When told by Parcells that was not what he was assigned to do on that play, and that what he did was not in the playbook, Taylor responded [...] "Well, we better put it in on Monday, because that play's a dandy." [...] He recorded 9.5 sacks in 1981, and his rookie season {{is considered one of the}} best in NFL history. He was named 1981's NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year, making him [...] the only rookie to win an Offensive or Defensive Player of the Year award. Taylor's arrival helped the Giants defense reduce their points allowed from 425 points in 1980 to 257 in 1981. They finished the season 9–7, up five games from the previous season, and advanced to the NFL divisional playoffs, where they lost 38–24 to the eventual Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers. The San Francisco win was due partly to a new tactic 49ers coach Bill Walsh used to slow Taylor. Walsh assigned guard John Ayers, the team's best blocker, to block Taylor and, although Taylor still recorded a sack and three tackles, he was not as effective as normal. In contrast to his on-field success Taylor was already developing a reputation for recklessness off the field; after nearly getting killed during the season when his speeding resulted in a car crash, Young told the team's trainer he would be <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> linebacker lived past the age of 30, and the Giants insured Taylor's life for $2 million.|$|E

[...] I would not be <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Hezbollah made them stay." [...] According to Human Rights Watch, though many civilians in South Lebanon refused to abandon their homes and act on the IDF's warnings, many others were unable to flee due to crumbled infrastructure. Israel singled out much of Lebanese civilian infrastructure for destruction throughout the war {{and at the end}} of the conflict the damage was estimated to top 2.5 billion dollars.|$|E

2500|$|On 26 February 2004, Short alleged on the BBC Today radio {{programme}} that British spies regularly intercept UN communications, {{including those of}} Kofi Annan, then Secretary-General. The claim was made {{the day after the}} unexplained dropping of whistleblowing charges against former GCHQ translator Katharine Gun. Reacting to Short's statement, Tony Blair said [...] "I really do regard what Clare Short has said this morning as totally irresponsible, and entirely consistent [...]" [...] Blair also claimed that Short had put British security, particularly the security of its spies, at risk. The same day, on the BBC's Newsnight programme, Short called Blair's response [...] "pompous" [...] and said that Britain had no need to spy on Kofi Annan. Blair did not explicitly deny the claims but Robin Cook, former Foreign Secretary, wrote that in his experience he would be <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> claims were true.|$|E
2500|$|In general, {{there was}} a lack of vision and serious {{interest}} in the United States concerning the potential of rocketry, especially in Washington. Although the Weather Bureau was interested beginning in 1929 in Goddard's rocket for atmospheric research, the Bureau could not secure governmental funding. Between the World Wars, the Guggenheim Foundation was the main source of funding for Goddard's research. Goddard's liquid-fueled rocket was neglected by his country, according to aerospace historian Eugene Emme, but was noticed and advanced by other nations, especially the Germans. Interestingly, Goddard showed remarkable prescience in 1923 in a letter to the Smithsonian. He knew that the Germans were very interested in rocketry and said he [...] "would not be <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> research would become something in the nature of a race" [...] and he wondered how soon the European [...] "theorists" [...] would begin to build rockets.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008 Dr John Jackson of the Turin Shroud Center of Colorado {{proposed}} a new hypothesis – namely {{the possibility of}} more recent enrichment if carbon monoxide were to slowly interact with a fabric so as to deposit its enriched carbon into the fabric, interpenetrating into the fibrils {{that make up the}} cloth. Jackson proposed to test if this were actually possible. Professor Christopher Ramsey, the director of the Oxford University Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit, took the theory seriously and agreed to collaborate with Jackson in testing a series of linen samples that could determine if the case for the Shroud's authenticity should be re-opened. He told the BBC that [...] "With the radiocarbon measurements and with all of the other evidence which we have about the Shroud, {{there does seem to be}} a conflict in the interpretation of the different evidence." [...] Professor Ramsey stressed that he would be <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> results of the 1988 tests were shown to be far out – especially [...] "a thousand years wrong" [...] – but he insisted that he was keeping an open mind.|$|E

2500|$|The {{amendments}} {{were initially}} received with mixed {{responses from the}} opposition CHP, which have long {{been critical of the}} AKP's constitutional plans. Shortly after the proposals were made public and submitted to Parliament on 10 December, Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım reported that the CHP was in agreement with 5 of the proposed changes. However, reception by the CHP was negative, with the party's deputy leader Selin Sayek Böke claiming that the proposals essentially created a [...] "sultanate". Parliamentary group leader Levent Gök, {{one of the first to}} comment on the released proposals, claimed that the changes would revert 140 years of Turkish parliamentary democracy, calling on all parties to reject the proposals. Another of the CHP's parliamentary group leaders, [...] Özgür Özel, called the proposals a [...] "regime change", with the parliament being left essentially powerless in scrutinising ministers and holding them to account. Özel claimed that the AKP were unlikely to obtain the 330 votes necessary to put the changes to a referendum, stating that he would be <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> number of MPs voting in favour reached 275. CHP MP Selina Doğan claimed that the authoritarian nature of the proposals would effectively end Turkey's EU accession negotiations, citing the lack of any relevance to European values. CHP MP Cemal Oktan Yüksel claimed that the proposals resembled the constitution of Assad's Syria, stating that it wouldn't be a national constitution but [...] "Syria's constitution translated".|$|E
