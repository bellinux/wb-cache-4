5|$|Emus drink infrequently, but ingest {{large amounts}} when the {{opportunity}} arises. They typically drink once a day, first inspecting the water body and surrounding area in groups before kneeling down at the edge to drink. They prefer being on firm ground while drinking, rather than on rocks or mud, but if they sense danger, they often stand rather than kneel. If not disturbed, they may drink continuously for ten minutes. Due to the scarcity of water sources, emus are sometimes forced to go without water for <b>several</b> <b>days.</b> <b>In</b> the wild, they often share water holes with kangaroos, other birds and animals; they are wary and tend {{to wait for the}} other animals to leave before they quench their thirst.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Ginger {{originated}} in a cold-core upper-level low that persisted for <b>several</b> <b>days</b> <b>in</b> early September in the Western Atlantic Ocean. The upper-level low was located within a large, persistent area of convection from the Gulf of Mexico through the central Atlantic, which resembled the Intertropical Convergence Zone {{but at a}} higher latitude. The convective feature was influenced by an anticyclone located over northern South America, which was opposite of the typical flow for September. The anticyclone also {{led to the formation}} of Hurricane Fern, Tropical Storm Heidi, and two tropical depressions. By September 5, the low had descended to the surface as its thermal structure warmed, and the next day it developed into a tropical depression about 235 mi (375 km) northeast of the Bahamas.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases of}} serious {{poisoning}} the mushroom causes delirium, somewhat similar in effect to anticholinergic poisoning (such as that caused by Datura stramonium), characterised by bouts of marked agitation with confusion, hallucinations, and irritability followed by periods of {{central nervous system}} depression. Seizures and coma may also occur in severe poisonings. Symptoms typically appear after around 30 to 90 minutes and peak within three hours, but certain effects can last for <b>several</b> <b>days.</b> <b>In</b> {{the majority of cases}} recovery is complete within 12 to 24hours. The effect is highly variable between individuals, with similar doses potentially causing quite different reactions. Some people suffering intoxication have exhibited headaches up to ten hours afterwards. Retrograde amnesia and somnolence can result following recovery.|$|E

5|$|Later, {{the rains}} caused the worst {{flooding}} in over 20years in Swaziland, which {{damaged or destroyed}} more than 100bridges. Disrupted transport left areas isolated for <b>several</b> <b>days.</b> <b>In</b> South Africa, rainfall peaked at 950mm (37in), which flooded 29river basins, notably the Pongola River which altered its course after the storm. Flooding caused the Pongolapoort Dam to reach 87% of its capacity; when waters were released to maintain the structural integrity, additional flooding occurred in Mozambique, forcing thousands to evacuate. Throughout the region, Domoina caused widespread flooding that damaged houses, roads, and crops, leaving about $199million in damage. There were 242deaths in southeastern Africa.|$|E

Leicester City named a 14-man squad before travelling to a training camp in Bisham on the Tuesday. Manchester City travelled south on the Thursday, staying in Weybridge. Leicester had fitness doubts over Dave Gibson, Len Glover and John Sjoberg, but initially expected all three to be available for the final.

5|$|The {{meteorological}} {{history of}} Hurricane Gordon {{consisted of a}} thirteen-day {{period in which the}} storm's path was erratic, persistent, and highly unusual. The hurricane formed near Panama in the southwestern Caribbean on November 9, 1994. As a tropical depression it brushed Nicaragua and spent <b>several</b> <b>days</b> <b>in</b> the waters off the country's coast. Strengthening slightly into a tropical storm, Gordon wound its way north into the Greater Antilles. Despite warm waters, persistent wind shear prevented significant strengthening. Executing a slow turn to the north and then the northwest, Gordon made two more landfalls, on eastern Jamaica and eastern Cuba, while delivering tremendous rains to western Hispaniola.|$|E
5|$|When World War II in Europe ended, Potthast was in Achensee, Austria and, after {{learning}} {{of the death of}} Himmler on the radio on 23 May 1945, went into hiding, living temporarily with Eleonore Pohl in Rosenheim, Upper Bavaria. In June/July 1945, she was arrested there by members of the U.S. Army and interrogated for <b>several</b> <b>days</b> <b>in</b> Munich. Margarete and Himmler's daughter, Gudrun Burwitz, did not learn of her half-siblings until after the war. When she tried to make contact with them, Potthast refused. She lived in Theissendorf and kept in contact with the family of Himmler's older brother, Gebhard, as well as Himmler's former close confidant, Karl Wolff, until the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|A Television Infrared Observation Satellite (TIROS) {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} a tropical disturbance east of the Leeward Islands on September28. A reconnaissance aircraft flight into a system on the following day indicated that a tropical depression developed near 14.5°N, 48.9°W. The depression initially moved west-northwestward and remained disorganized for <b>several</b> <b>days.</b> <b>In</b> {{the early stages of the}} depression, the system appeared to have been located under minor vortices in the upper atmosphere, located within a strong easttowest oriented trough. Approaching the Lesser Antilles, the system curved northwestward between two high pressure areas on September30 and avoided landfall in the islands. By October2, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Daisy. The trough dissipated on the following day, causing Daisy to resume its initial west-northwest motion. The storm intensified into a Category1 hurricane later on October3. Further deepening occurred, and by October5, Daisy became a Category2 hurricane.|$|E
