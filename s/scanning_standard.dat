40|$|AbstractBackgroundHuntington's disease (HD) is characterised by both {{regional}} and generalised neuronal cell {{loss in the}} brain. Investigating functional brain connectivity patterns in rest in HD {{has the potential to}} broaden the understanding of brain functionality in relation to disease progression. This study aims to establish whether brain connectivity during rest is different in premanifest and manifest HD as compared to controls. MethodsAt the Leiden University Medical Centre study site of the TRACK-HD study, 20 early HD patients (disease stages 1 and 2), 28 premanifest gene carriers and 28 healthy controls underwent 3 T MRI <b>scanning.</b> <b>Standard</b> and high-resolution T 1 -weighted images and a resting state fMRI scan were acquired. Using FSL, group differences in resting state connectivity were examined for eight networks of interest using a dual regression method. With a voxelwise correction for localised atrophy, group differences in functional connectivity were examined. ResultsBrain connectivity of the left middle frontal and pre-central gyrus, and right post central gyrus with the medial visual network was reduced in premanifest and manifest HD as compared to controls (0. 05 >p> 0. 0001). In manifest HD connectivity of numerous widespread brain regions with the default mode network and the executive control network were reduced (0. 05 >p> 0. 0001). DiscussionBrain regions that show reduced intrinsic functional connectivity are present in premanifest gene carriers and to a much larger extent in manifest HD patients. These differences are present even when the potential influence of atrophy is taken into account. Resting state fMRI could potentially be used for early disease detection in the premanifest phase of HD and for monitoring of disease modifying compounds...|$|E

40|$|AbstractPurposeThis {{prospective}} {{study was designed}} to determine the upper limits of normal for duration and maximum velocity of retrograde flow (RF) in lower extremity veins. MethodsEighty limbs in 40 healthy subjects and 60 limbs in 45 patients with chronic venous disease were examined with duplex scanning in the standing and supine positions. Each limb was assessed for reflux at 16 venous sites, including the common femoral, deep femoral, and proximal and distal femoral veins; proximal and distal popliteal veins; gastrocnemial vein; anterior and posterior tibial veins; peroneal vein; greater saphenous vein, at the saphenofemoral junction, thigh, upper calf, and lower calf; and lesser saphenous vein, at the saphenopopliteal junction and mid-calf. Perforator veins along the course of these veins were also assessed. In the healthy volunteers, 1553 vein segments were assessed, including 480 superficial vein segments, 800 deep vein segments, and 273 perforator vein segments; and in the patients, 1272 vein segments were assessed, including 360 superficial vein segments, 600 deep vein segments, and 312 perforator vein segments. Detection and measurement of reflux were performed at duplex <b>scanning.</b> <b>Standard</b> pneumatic cuff compression pressure was used to elicit reflux. Duration of RF and peak vein velocity were measured immediately after release of compression. ResultsDuration of RF in the superficial veins ranged from 0 to 2400 ms (mean, 210 ms), and was less than 500 ms in 96. 7 % of these veins. In the perforator veins, regardless of location, outward flow ranged from 0 to 760 ms (mean, 170 ms), and was less than 350 ms in 97 % of these veins. In the deep veins, RF ranged from 0 to 2600 ms. Mean RF in the deep femoral veins and calf veins was 190 ms, and was less than 500 ms in 97. 6 % of these veins. In the femoropopliteal veins, mean RF was 390 ms, and ranged from 510 to 2600 ms in 21 of 400 segments; however, RF was less than 990 ms in 99 % of these veins. Duration of RF was significantly longer in all three veins systems in patients (P <. 0001 for all comparisons). With a cutoff value of more than 1000 ms rather than more than 500 ms, prevalence of abnormal RF in the femoropopliteal veins was significantly reduced, from 29 % to 18 % (P =. 002). Thirty-seven vein segments (2. 4 %) had RF greater than 500 ms in the supine position, compared with less than 500 ms in 22 of these vein segments (59 %) in the standing position. Of the 48 vein segments (3. 1 %) with RF greater than 500 ms in the standing position, RF was less than 500 ms in 6 of these vein segments (13 %) in the supine position. Similar observations were noted in patient veins. There was no association between RF and peak vein velocity. Peak vein velocity had no significance in determining reflux. ConclusionsThe cutoff value for reflux in the superficial and deep calf veins is greater than 500 ms. However, the reflux cutoff value for the femoropopliteal veins should be greater than 1000 ms. Outward flow in the perforating veins should be considered abnormal at greater than 350 ms. Reflux testing should be performed with the patient standing...|$|E

40|$|Purpose Combined-modality {{treatment}} is standard treatment {{for patients with}} clinical stage I/II Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). We hypothesized that an early positron emission tomography (PET) scan {{could be used to}} adapt treatment. Therefore, we started the randomized EORTC/LYSA/FIL Intergroup H 10 trial evaluating whether involved-node radiotherapy (IN-RT) could be omitted without compromising progression-free survival in patients attaining a negative early PET scan after two cycles of ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) as compared with standard combined-modality treatment. Patients and Methods Patients age 15 to 70 years with untreated clinical stage I/II HL were eligible. Here we report the clinical outcome of the preplanned interim futility analysis scheduled to occur after documentation of 34 events in the early PET-negative group. Because testing for futility in this noninferiority trial corresponds to testing the hypothesis of no difference, a one-sided superiority test was conducted. Results The analysis included 1, 137 patients. In the favorable subgroup, 85. 8 % had a negative early PET <b>scan</b> (<b>standard</b> arm, one event v experimental arm, nine events). In the unfavorable subgroup, 74. 8 % had a negative early PET <b>scan</b> (<b>standard</b> arm, seven events v experimental arm, 16 events). The independent data monitoring committee concluded it was unlikely that we would show noninferiority in the final results for the experimental arm and advised stopping random assignment for early PET-negative patients. Conclusion On the basis of this analysis, combined-modality treatment resulted in fewer early progressions in clinical stage I/II HL, although early outcome was excellent in both arms.

40|$|This paper proposes an {{method for}} testing a circuit {{in order to}} improve defect {{coverage}} of delays due to resistive open and close. The proposed method uses a signature analysis and a scan design to detect small delay defects. This measures the delay of the explicitly sensitized paths with the resolution of the on-chip variable clock generator. The proposed scan design measures the small delay in short measurement time by delay measurement technique and extra latches for storing the test vectors. By evaluating with Rohm 0. 18 -μm process shows that the measurement time is 67. 8 % reduced compared with that of the delay measurement with <b>standard</b> <b>scan</b> design and the area overhead is larger than that of the delay measurement architecture using <b>standard</b> <b>scan</b> design...|$|R
