40|$|The Pneuflo {{concept is}} a radical {{departure}} from conventional harvesting technology. It depends on air flow to transport material from the <b>stripping</b> <b>header</b> to the thresher and for the removal of dust, chaff and straw from the grain. It took several decades to develop, with many working models in the process. To detail every drawing and test result made over this period would be {{beyond the scope of this}} paper. Ian G.

500|$|Sammy was inarticulate, making {{little more}} than mouth noises; the adults around him conversed, but in a {{monotonous}} manner that did not invite careful reading. [...] Neither did he learn from his foibles nor grow as a character. [...] Sammy and McCay's other child protagonists {{differ from those of}} Outcault and other popular cartoonists, such as Rudolph Dirks and his rambunctious, pranking Katzenjammer Kids. [...] Sammy takes no pleasure in the trouble he causes; rather, as the <b>strip's</b> <b>header</b> declares: [...] "He just simply couldn't stop it." [...] On occasion his sneezes have positive consequences, as when he frightens a stubborn mule {{to move out of the}} way of an oncoming train, or foils a group of kidnappers.|$|R

50|$|Because many free email {{services}} do {{not require}} valid identifying information, and also allow communication with many victims in a short span of time, they are the preferred method of communication for scammers. Some services {{go so far as}} to mask the sender's source IP address (Gmail being a common choice), making the scammer more difficult to trace to country of origin. While Gmail does indeed <b>strip</b> <b>headers</b> from emails, it is in fact possible to trace an IP address from such an email. Scammers can create as many accounts as they wish, and often have several at a time. In addition, if email providers are alerted to the scammer's activities and suspend the account, it is a trivial matter for the scammer to simply create a new account to resume scamming.|$|R
500|$|The <b>strip's</b> <b>header</b> {{declared}} {{to each side}} of the title [...] "He just simply couldn't stop" [...] and [...] "He never knew when it was coming", and never strayed from the basic formula of build-up, release, and consequence. [...] McCay was to make use of such framing devices throughout his career, as in Little Nemo where the reader could rely on the protagonist awakening in the closing panel each week. Scott Bukatman and Thierry Smolderen saw the monotony of Sammy Sneeze as an attempt by McCay at parody—one that, in Smolderen's words, [...] "chuckles at the absurdity of... doing the same thing ad nauseam". Noah Berlatsky objected to the idea, calling the strip [...] "excessive and infantile, linked, not to a sense of irony, but a sense of wonder", which he compared to the [...] "eternal appetite of infancy" [...] that G.K. Chesterton in Orthodoxy (1908) attributed to the Christian God.|$|R
50|$|A socket {{that has}} been {{connected}} to another socket, e.g., during {{the establishment of a}} TCP connection, also has a remote socket address. Within the operating system and the application that created a socket, a socket is referred to by a unique integer value called a socket descriptor. The operating system forwards the payload of incoming IP packets to the corresponding application by extracting the socket address information from the IP and transport protocol <b>headers</b> and <b>stripping</b> the <b>headers</b> from the application data.|$|R
30|$|The VLAN marking of each packet {{needs to}} be passed from MCE to WCE and vice versa if it is {{required}} to still know the SLA of the packet {{at the other side}} of the wireless links. Sending the header with the VLAN tag of each packet results in quite some overhead over the wireless T 2 W links. Therefore, it would be better to <b>strip</b> this <b>header</b> and instead use some bits in the Flow Label field of the IP header to indicate the VLAN tag and thus the corresponding SLA.|$|R
50|$|In IPFC, each IP {{datagram}} packet {{is wrapped}} into a FC frame, {{with its own}} header, and transmitted as a sequence {{of one or more}} frames. The receiver at the other end received the frames, <b>strips</b> the FC <b>headers</b> and reassembles the IP packet. IP datagrams of up to 65,280 bytes in size may be accommodated. ARP packet transmission works in the same fashion. Each IP datagram exchange is unidirectional, although IP and TCP allow for bidirectional communication within their protocols.|$|R
30|$|Using {{a packet}} facade, network {{services}} {{do not need}} to <b>strip</b> the protocol <b>headers</b> from received packets to interact with packets. Thus, when non-essential network services are omitted from devices with low resources, the remaining network services can still interpret the received packets. In addition, packet attributes remain associated with a packet even if network protocols are omitted at intermediate nodes. Thus, when lightweight nodes are provided with simpler versions of the network services, these simpler services can inspect the packet attributes that were added by more advanced network services.|$|R

Shortly after it was reposted in 1995 it quickly began to spread, being posted on Usenet 24 times within the next month. In 1996 the legend was further embellished with references to the year of manufacture of the car and G-Forces and to the form which was widely circulated via email (55% of all postings on usenet which included [...] "JATO Rocket Darwin Award impala" [...] also included [...] "g-forces".|$|R
40|$|Theoretical {{analysis}} and experiment validation {{were conducted to}} optimize development of improved <b>stripping</b> harvesters. The <b>header</b> loss of the stripping harvesters was greatly influenced by parameters such as the height and rotational speed of the stripping rotor, the forward velocity of the machine, and the airflow field, etc. Mathematical models for the optimal design {{and the use of}} stripping harvesters were developed. During the operation, the center axis of the stripping rotor must be at the height below the ears of crops. When the cylinder was running, the linear velocity of the stripping teeth should be up to 14 – 17 m/s (the keyhole center of slotted teeth). Also, the airflow velocity at the entrance should be higher than that at the exit and should not be lower than 5 m/s...|$|R
40|$|The Glasgow Haskell {{compiler}} {{provides a}} foreign language interface which allows Haskell programs to call arbitrary C functions. This has been used both to implement the standard Haskell IO system {{and a variety of}} applications including an arcade game [8], and a graphical user interface to a database [19]. The theoretical problems associated with using impure functions from pure functional languages are avoided through the use of monads [17]; and the mismatch between strict languages with no garbage collection and lazy languages with garbage collection is tackled by unboxing (that is, forcing evaluation of arguments and <b>stripping</b> off any <b>header</b> information) [15]. Whilst this works well for simple examples, it is unsuitable when one wants to pass arguments (or results) which are lazy, polymorphic or very large. We describe two extensions to the garbage collector which solve these problems by allowing better interaction between the Haskell garbage collector and memory allocation in the im [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Providing the {{possibility}} to run personalised econometric/statistical analyses on the appropriate data sets by remote processing allows greater flexibility {{in the production of}} economic information. Binding confidentiality requirements are required with business survey data. The Bank of Italy's infrastructure allows its business survey data to be exploited, while preserving anonymity of individual data. The system is based on the LISSY platform and has been already adopted by the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) and other research centres. Firms' privacy is safeguarded by forbidding potentially confidentiality-breaking programme statements and by denying the visualisation of individual data. Data confidentiality is protected by removing key identifiers from the database and by trimming data in the right tail of the distribution. The platform provides its services through plain-text e-mails. The authorised user sends an e-mail containing an identifying header followed by a statistical programme to a predetermined address. The system checks the validity of the <b>header,</b> <b>strips</b> out the code and submits it in a batch to one of the econometric/statistical packages available (SAS and Stata). The outputs are mailed back to the user after passing an array of automatic and manual checks. microdata, confidentiality, remote access...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} some merging options between an upper-layer Bluetooth (BT) protocol stack with a lower-layer ECMA- 368 / 9 Ultra Wideband (UWB) radio connection. A Bluetooth over Ultra Wideband (BToUWB) system is implemented by channelling an existing compliant Bluetooth connection’s data over an Ultra Wideband Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical (PHY) layer radio channel. The aim of this project {{is to provide a}} description of the methodology used to create a BToUWB link and evaluate some advantages pertaining to the merger between the two Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) technologies. Prior to channelling data over a UWB connection, a compliant Bluetooth and UWB connection were configured between two Linux enabled computers by use of Bluetooth and UWB enabled Universal Serial Bus (USB) dongles. BlueZ, the official Bluetooth stack for Linux, were used to implement a modified Bluetooth stack. By modifying the open source BlueZ files, the Host Controller Interface (HCI) commands sent to the HCI sublayer by upper layer Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L 2 CAP) and Synchronous Connection-Oriented (SCO) implementations were hijacked and routed to a UWB “router and convergence” implementation for transmission over the UWB subsytem. Similarly lower level HCI events were spoofed to the L 2 CAP and SCO layers by the UWB convergence implementation upon receiving packets from the UWB subsystem. The commercial availability of UWB hardware through Wireless USB dongles enabled the realization of a compliant UWB link between the systems, requiring special driver modifications and Intel provided firmware to establish a WiMedia Logical Link Control Protocol (WLP) network. A specially developed test program generates L 2 CAP, Radio Frequency Communication (RFCOMM) and SCO Bluetooth data for testing the BToUWB link. The various Bluetooth data packets are routed from the Bluetooth stack to a developed kernel space routing module, which encapsulated the packets and route them via the WLP interface over the wireless high-speed UWB network to the remote system. On the remote side, the packets propagate its way back up through the UWB hardware and software module, and to the router module via call-back functions in the WLP interface. The router module <b>strips</b> the <b>headers</b> and injects the packets back into the Bluetooth L 2 CAP, RFCOMM or SCO layer for further Bluetooth processing. A test program running on the remote system, receives the test data and loops it back for asynchronous analyses, or stores it for later comparison in synchronous analyses. The results obtained from the system analyses shows how a Bluetooth system can benefit from implementing UWB as lower layer wireless interface over a short range by either improved asynchronous bandwidth, or synchronous reliability. The results also show some limitations of the pilot UWB hardware and firmware available over longer distances. In general, the successful transmission of Bluetooth data over the BToUWB implemented system proves the HCI layer to be a viable mergence point between the two protocols.
