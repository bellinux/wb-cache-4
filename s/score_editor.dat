This paper {{presents}} the innovations {{developed for the}} Intelligent System for Piano Fingering Learning Aid – SIEDP, a software application utilized as fingering technique learning aid by beginner students of the Piano Courses. The original SIEDP have some limitations in both the user interface and in the genetic algorithm utilized to find the optimal fingering of a given piano melody. This paper shows some modifications {{that we have done}} to overcome these limitations. The new user interface allows to use commercial <b>score</b> <b>editors</b> to input melodies to the system.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{development of the}} ubiquitous computer keyboard to capture velocity and other continuous musical properties, {{in order to support}} more expressive interaction with music software. Building on existing ‘virtual piano’ utilities, the device is designed to provide a richer mechanism for note entry within predominantly non-realtime editing tasks, in applications where keyboard interaction is a central component of the user experience (<b>score</b> <b>editors,</b> sequencers, DAWs, trackers, live coding), and in which users draw on virtuosities in both music and computing. In the keyboard, additional hardware combines existing scan code (key press) data with accelerometer readings to create a secondary USB device, using the same cable but visible to software as a separate USB MIDI device aside existing USB HID functionality. This paper {{presents a}}nd evaluates an initial prototype, developed using an Arduino board and inexpensive sensors, and discusses design considerations and test findings in musical applications, drawing on user studies of keyboard-mediated music interaction.

40|$|Music {{synthesis}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} essential features of music notation software and applications aimed at navigating digital music score libraries. Currently, the majority of music synthesis tools are designed for Eurogenetic musics, and they are not able to address the culture-specific aspects (such as tuning, intonation and timbre) of many music cultures. In this paper, we focus on the tuning dimension in musical score playback for Turkish Makam Music (TMM). Based on existing computational tuning analysis methodologies, we propose an automatic synthesis methodology, which allows the user to listen to a music score synthesized according to the tuning extracted from an audio recording. As a proof-of-concept, we also present a desktop application, which allows the users to listen to playback of TMM music scores according to the theoretical temperament or a user specified reference recording. The playback of the synthesis using the tuning extracted from the recordings may provide a better user experience, and it may be used to assist music education, enhance music <b>score</b> <b>editors</b> and complement research in computational musicology...|$|R
40|$|We {{present in}} this paper a pen-based musical <b>score</b> <b>editor</b> prototype. It allows the user to edit quite {{the same way as}} if it was on a sheet of paper, all of his drawing strokes being {{progressively}} recognized and replaced by their corresponding symbol by the system, right during the editing. Most of the classical musical symbols are already available, as well as the basic editing possibilities. We propose a new way to recognize the musical symbols thanks to the knowledge of musical structure, graphically represented by boxes. Finding the structural box in which a stroke is drawn reduces the possible symbols. It helps minimizing ambiguities and increases recognition rates. First tests among musicians are satisfactory and encouraging. 1...|$|E
40|$|International audienceComputer-aided {{composition}} systems enable composers {{to write}} programs to generate and transform musical scores. In this sense, constraint programming is appealing {{because of its}} declarative nature: the composer constrains the score and relies on a solver to automatically provide solutions. However, the existing constraint solvers often lack interactivity. Specifically, the composers {{do not participate in}} the selection of a particular solution. We propose an interactive search algorithm that enables the composer to alter and to navigate in the solution space. To this aim, we propose spacetime programming, a paradigm based on lattices and synchronous process calculi. The result is an interactive <b>score</b> <b>editor</b> with constraint support, and we experiment it on the all-interval series problem...|$|E
