50|$|Any {{discussion}} of <b>sonoluminescence</b> must include {{a detailed analysis}} of metastability. <b>Sonoluminescence</b> in this respect is what is physically termed a bounded phenomenon meaning that the <b>sonoluminescence</b> exists in a bounded region of parameter space for the bubble; a coupled magnetic field being one such parameter. The magnetic aspects of <b>sonoluminescence</b> are very well documented.|$|E
50|$|Prior to {{the early}} 1990s, the studies on {{different}} chemical and physical variables of <b>sonoluminescence</b> were all conducted using multi-bubble <b>sonoluminescence</b> (MBSL). This was a problem since all of the theories and bubble dynamics were based on single bubble <b>sonoluminescence</b> (SBSL) and researchers believed that the bubble oscillations of neighboring bubbles could affect each other. Single bubble <b>sonoluminescence</b> wasn't achieved until the early 1990s and allowed {{the study of the}} effects of various parameters on a single cavitating bubble. After many of the early theories were disproved, the remaining plausible theories can be classified into two different processes: electrical and thermal.|$|E

50|$|Unlike single-bubble <b>sonoluminescence,</b> multi-bubble <b>sonoluminescence</b> is the {{creation}} of many oscillating and collapsing bubbles. Typically in MBSL, the light emission from each individual bubble is weaker than in SBSL because the neighboring bubbles can interact and affect each other. Because each neighboring bubble can interact with each other, it can {{make it more difficult to}} produce accurate studies and to characterize the properties of the collapsing bubble.|$|E

50|$|An unusually exotic {{hypothesis}} of <b>sonoluminescence,</b> which has received much popular attention, is the Casimir energy hypothesis suggested by noted physicist Julian Schwinger and more thoroughly considered {{in a paper}} by Claudia Eberlein of the University of Sussex. Eberlein's paper suggests that the light in <b>sonoluminescence</b> is generated by the vacuum within the bubble in a process similar to Hawking radiation, the radiation generated at the event horizon of black holes. According to this vacuum energy explanation, since quantum theory holds that vacuum contains virtual particles, the rapidly moving interface between water and gas converts virtual photons into real photons. This {{is related to the}} Unruh effect or the Casimir effect. If true, <b>sonoluminescence</b> may be the first observable example of quantum vacuum radiation. The argument has been made that <b>sonoluminescence</b> releases too large an amount of energy and releases the energy on too short a time scale to be consistent with the vacuum energy explanation, although other credible sources argue the vacuum energy explanation might yet prove to be correct.|$|E

50|$|Because {{the bubble}} {{collapse}} occurs within microseconds, the hot spot theory {{states that the}} thermal energy results from an adiabatic bubble collapse. In 1950 {{it was assumed that}} the bubble internal temperatures were as high as 10,000 K at the collapse of a spherical symmetric bubble. In the 1990s, <b>sonoluminescence</b> spectra were used by Suslick to measure effective emission temperatures in bubble clouds (multibubble <b>sonoluminescence)</b> of 5000 K, and more recently temperatures as high as 20,000 K in single bubble cavitation.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{greatest}} obstacles in <b>sonoluminescence</b> research {{has been trying to}} obtain measurements of the interior of the bubble. Most measurements, like temperature and pressure, are indirectly measured using models and bubble dynamics.|$|E

50|$|The {{mechanism}} of the phenomenon of <b>sonoluminescence</b> is unknown. Hypotheses include: hotspot, bremsstrahlung radiation, collision-induced radiation and corona discharges, nonclassical light, proton tunneling, electrodynamic jets and fractoluminescent jets (now largely discredited due to contrary experimental evidence).|$|E
50|$|In 1989 an {{experimental}} advance {{was introduced by}} D. Felipe Gaitan and Lawrence Crum, who produced stable single-bubble <b>sonoluminescence</b> (SBSL). In SBSL, a single bubble trapped in an acoustic standing wave emits a pulse of light with each compression of the bubble within the standing wave. This technique allowed a more systematic study of the phenomenon, because it isolated the complex effects into one stable, predictable bubble. It was realized that the temperature inside the bubble was hot enough to melt steel. Interest in <b>sonoluminescence</b> was renewed when an inner temperature of such a bubble well above one million kelvins was postulated. This temperature is thus far not conclusively proven; rather, recent experiments conducted by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign indicate temperatures around 20000 K.|$|E
50|$|The snap {{can also}} produce <b>sonoluminescence</b> from the {{collapsing}} cavitation bubble. As it collapses, the cavitation bubble reaches temperatures of over 5000 K. In comparison, the surface {{temperature of the}} sun {{is estimated to be}} around 5800 K. The light is of lower intensity than the light produced by typical <b>sonoluminescence</b> and is not visible to the naked eye. It is most likely a by-product of the shock wave with no biological significance. However, it was the first known instance of an animal producing light by this effect. It has subsequently been discovered that another group of crustaceans, the mantis shrimp, contains species whose club-like forelimbs can strike so quickly and with such force as to induce sonoluminescent cavitation bubbles upon impact.|$|E
50|$|The <b>sonoluminescence</b> {{effect was}} first {{discovered}} at the University of Cologne in 1934 {{as a result}} of work on sonar. H. Frenzel and H. Schultes put an ultrasound transducer in a tank of photographic developer fluid. They hoped to speed up the development process. Instead, they noticed tiny dots on the film after developing and realized that the bubbles in the fluid were emitting light with the ultrasound turned on. It was too difficult to analyze the effect in early experiments because of the complex environment {{of a large number of}} short-lived bubbles. (This experiment is also ascribed to N. Marinesco and J. J. Trillat in 1933, which also credits them with independent discovery). This phenomenon is now referred to as multi-bubble <b>sonoluminescence</b> (MBSL).|$|E
50|$|<b>Sonoluminescence</b> {{can occur}} when a sound wave of {{sufficient}} intensity induces a gaseous cavity within a liquid to collapse quickly. This cavity {{may take the}} form of a pre-existing bubble, or may be generated through a process known as cavitation. <b>Sonoluminescence</b> in the laboratory can be made to be stable, so that a single bubble will expand and collapse over and over again in a periodic fashion, emitting a burst of light each time it collapses. For this to occur, a standing acoustic wave is set up within a liquid, and the bubble will sit at a pressure anti-node of the standing wave. The frequencies of resonance depend on the shape and size of the container in which the bubble is contained.|$|E
50|$|His {{research}} areas {{included both}} pure mathematics (projective geometry, polytopes, random functions and surfaces) and applied mathematics (fluid dynamics, microseisms, {{the generation of}} ocean waves by wind, the dynamics of bubbles, <b>sonoluminescence,</b> wave breaking, steep waves, and the exchange of heat and gases at the ocean surface).|$|E
50|$|Cavitating water {{purification}} devices {{have also been}} designed, in which the extreme conditions of cavitation can break down pollutants and organic molecules. Spectral analysis of light emitted in sonochemical reactions reveal chemical and plasma-based mechanisms of energy transfer. The light emitted from cavitation bubbles is termed <b>sonoluminescence.</b>|$|E
50|$|In February 2005 the {{documentary}} series Horizon commissioned two leading <b>sonoluminescence</b> researchers, Seth Putterman and Kenneth S. Suslick, to reproduce Taleyarkhan's work. Using similar acoustic parameters, deuterated acetone, similar bubble nucleation, {{and a much}} more sophisticated neutron detection device, the researchers could find {{no evidence of a}} fusion reaction.|$|E
