40|$|Since {{the start}} of the {{financial}} crisis in 2008, the Federal Reserve has been engaging in quantitative easing. Quantitative easing is a form of open market operation in which the Federal Reserve buys long-term U. S. government and other securities, versus traditional open market operations that occur through the short-term Treasury bill market. At the same time, the <b>shadow</b> <b>bank</b> system, which is a system of financial intermediaries that perform unregulated credit intermediation outside of traditional banks, has contracted significantly. Some argue that this contraction is due to a collateral crunch induced by quantitative easing in the <b>shadow</b> <b>bank</b> system—a crunch that occurred when the Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing program took high-quality collateral off the market. I will focus specifically on repurchase agreements, an instrument within the shadow banking that uses the same types of securities that the Federal Reserve has been buying during quantitative easing as collateral, to determine whether quantitative easing has led to a contraction of the repurchase agreement market. I find that increases in Federal Reserve asset holdings from 2005 - 2013, and specifically during QE 1, are associated with decreases in primary dealer repurchase agreements. This shows that under certain circumstances, Federal Reserve asset purchases lead to contractions in the <b>shadow</b> <b>bank</b> system. This paper aims to increase understanding of how monetary policy affects shadow banking and understanding of the unintended consequences of monetary policy, such as decreased <b>shadow</b> <b>bank</b> lending caused by quantitative easing...|$|E

40|$|This essay {{discusses}} the economic case for regulating <b>shadow</b> <b>banking.</b> It asks three questions. First, what is <b>shadow</b> <b>banking?</b> Second, why <b>shadow</b> <b>banking</b> should be regulated. Third, how to regulate <b>shadow</b> <b>banking</b> efficiently. Although <b>shadow</b> <b>banking</b> is, like banking, based on maturity transformation, no definition of <b>shadow</b> <b>banking</b> {{is ideal for}} regulatory purposes. Focusing on systemic risk, we take an instrument-based approach and define banking as leveraging on collateral to support liquidity promises. For regulation to be effective, however, this definition must be combined with other entity-based approaches. The economic rationale for regulating <b>shadow</b> <b>banking</b> is the negative externality stemming from systemic risk. Because uncertainty makes any measure of systemic risk imprecise, quantity regulation is preferable to a Pigovian tax {{to cope with this}} externality. Regulation should limit the leverage of <b>shadow</b> <b>banking</b> by imposing a minimum haircut regulation on the assets being used as collateral for funding. In theory, minimum haircuts regulation is an efficient way to constrain <b>shadow</b> <b>banking.</b> However, the practical difficulties of monitoring leverage at the assets level call for an indirect regulation of institutional leverage, too. This is effectively achieved through the regulation of bank leverage, which increases the cost of liquidity puts to <b>shadow</b> <b>banking.</b> Such risk-insensitive restrictions, however, undermine the efficiency of banking, whether official or shadow...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} why {{regulatory arbitrage}} and the interconnectivity between the traditional banking and shadow banking systems amplified the pro-cyclicality during {{the global financial}} crisis of 2007 - 2009; and discusses why the regulatory focus should turn to reducing the interconnectedness of the two systems {{in order to prevent}} systemic risk to the global financial system. This paper also predicts that Basel III’s heightened capital requirements will have a limited impact on curbing shadow banking activities and may inadvertently push traditional banks to rely even more on shadow banking in order to sustain their financial position or to generate greater revenue.

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of the market-based {{financial}} system since the mid- 1980 s {{changed the nature of}} financial intermediation in the United States profoundly. Within the market-based financial system, "shadow banks" are particularly important institutions. <b>Shadow</b> <b>banks</b> are financial intermediaries that conduct maturity, credit, and liquidity transformation without access to central bank liquidity or public sector credit guarantees. Examples of <b>shadow</b> <b>banks</b> include finance companies, asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) conduits, limited-purpose finance companies, structured investment vehicles, credit hedge funds, money market mutual funds, securities lenders, and government-sponsored enterprises.; <b>Shadow</b> <b>banks</b> are interconnected along a vertically integrated, long intermediation chain, which intermediates credit through a wide range of securitization and secured funding techniques such as ABCP, asset-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations, and repo. This intermediation chain binds <b>shadow</b> <b>banks</b> into a network, which is the <b>shadow</b> <b>banking</b> system. The <b>shadow</b> <b>banking</b> system rivals the traditional banking system in the intermediation of credit to households and businesses. Over the past decade, the <b>shadow</b> <b>banking</b> system provided sources of inexpensive funding for credit by converting opaque, risky, long-term assets into money-like and seemingly riskless short-term liabilities. Maturity and credit transformation in the <b>shadow</b> <b>banking</b> system thus contributed significantly to asset bubbles in residential and commercial real estate markets prior to the financial crisis.; We document that the <b>shadow</b> <b>banking</b> system became severely strained during the financial crisis because, like traditional <b>banks,</b> <b>shadow</b> <b>banks</b> conduct credit, maturity, and liquidity transformation, but unlike traditional financial intermediaries, they lack access to public sources of liquidity, such as the Federal Reserve's discount window, or public sources of insurance, such as federal deposit insurance. The liquidity facilities of the Federal Reserve and other government agencies' guarantee schemes were a direct response to the liquidity and capital shortfalls of <b>shadow</b> <b>banks</b> and, effectively, provided either a backstop to credit intermediation by the <b>shadow</b> <b>banking</b> system or to traditional banks for the exposure to <b>shadow</b> <b>banks.</b> Our paper documents the institutional features of <b>shadow</b> <b>banks,</b> discusses their economic roles, and analyzes their relation to the traditional banking system.

40|$|Why did {{the shadow}} banking sectors in the US and the euro area expand {{in the decade}} before the {{financial}} crisis {{and what are the}} implications for systemic risk and macro-prudential policy? This paper examines these issues with a model of the financial sector where the size of the shadow banking sector is endogenous. In the model, shadow banking is an alternative banking strategy which involves greater risk-taking at the expense of being exposed to "fundamental runs" on the funding side. When such runs occur, shadow banks liquidate their assets in a secondary market. Entry into shadow banking is profitable when traditional banks provide sufficient secondary market demand to prevent these liquidations from causing a fire-sale. During periods of stability, the shadow banking sector expands to an excessively large size that ferments systemic risk. Its collapse then triggers a fire-sale that renders traditional banks vulnerable to "liquidity runs". The prospect of liquidity runs undermines market discipline and increases the risk-taking incentives of traditional banks. Policy interventions aimed at alleviating the fire-sale fuel further expansion of the shadow banking sector.

My title adds a “y ” and an “ing ” to their term to stretch the shadows to include not just firms like money-market funds and government-sponsored enterprises, but instruments such as swaps, repurchase agreements and AAA securitizations that may trade for substantial periods of time as if they carried zero counterparty risk. Of course, any instrument can trade this way if it is believed that authorities will be afraid not to absorb all or most of the losses its holders might suffer. The perception of a governmenta...|$|E

But these banking risks can be present and indeed can be even more severe in a shadow banking system, or in a system which involves inter-linkages between bank balance-sheets, <b>shadow</b> <b>bank</b> balance-sheets, and capital markets. ” “Given the enormous cost which instability can produce, and given the uncertain benefits which this complexity has delivered, our regulatory response should therefore entail a bias to prudence – a bias against complex interconnectivity, against procyclical market contracts, and against allowing maturity transformation or high leverage to develop in unregulated institutions or markets. ” Adair Turner, p. 19 and p. 36 1 Overarching remarks The Financial Stability Board (FSB) mentions key issues of shadow banking such as excessive maturity liquidity transformation, immense leverage, procyclicality, highly complex and deeply intertwined credit intermediation chains as well as regulatory arbitrage. The FSB also provides a complex framework of meaningful measures. In order to make these measures effectively implementable, the following points are of relevance for all three consultative documents. 1. 1 Appropriate policies: more courage instead of less The FSB intends to design an approach which is proportionate to financial stability risks. However, quantitative specifications of the proposals are still missing. Even in the regular sector, standards are often far too low. A recent example is the renewed weakening of Basel III rules in terms of liquidity standards (Master). In order to be effective, the proposed measures must be substantial enough.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to examine shadow bankin g, paying {{particular}} attention to European securitisation markets, collateral intermediation, and money market funds. The term wa s introduced following the 2007 - 2008 financial crisis to describe credit intermediation activities undertaken partially or full y outside the regulated banking system, without explicit access to public sector backstops. The shadow banking sector’s dependency on short - term, wholesale funding renders it vulnerable to market turmoil, which in turn can affect the broader financial syst em through the sector’s close connection with financial institutions and key markets. In order to contextualize this topic the first chapter describes how credit intermediation is conducted within certain sectors of the shadow banking system, and what su pply and demand - side factors precipitated {{the rise of the}} system. The initial chapter also offers a brief overview of shadow banking’s role in the financial crisis, since the evolution of the term and the on - going discourse surrounding it is closely tied t o the stressed market conditions witnessed at the time. While initially, the thesis is most relevant in a US context since it was there the financial innovations discussed have been developed and widely adopted, the second chapter provides a n assessment of the European system. First, by performing a macro - mapping exercise aimed at providing a broad measure of the shadow banking system, and second, by conducting a more detailed analysis of institutions that serve as the focus for this thesis. The thesis demo nstrates that European shadow banking institutions fund the extension of credit, that they are important intermediaries in the short - term funding markets, and that they support a host of financial transactions. Although prevailing commentary on <b>shadow</b> <b>bank</b> ing has highlighted the systemic risk brought about by shadow banking, this thesis seeks to take a balanced view of the sector, also emphasising its positive impact on overall markets. nhhma...|$|E
40|$|Christopher Alexander’s {{architectural}} {{theory of}} a 2 ̆ 2 pattern language 2 ̆ 2 influenced {{the development of}} object-oriented computer programming. This pattern language framework also explains the design of legal contracts. Moreover, the pattern language rubric explains how legal agreements interlock to create complex transactions and how transactions interconnect to create markets. This pattern language framework helps account for evidence, including from the global financial crisis, of failures in modern contract design. A pattern represents an encapsulated conceptual solution to a recurring design problem. Patterns save architects and designers from having to reinvent the wheel; they can use solutions that evolved over time to address similar problems. Contract patterns represent encapsulated solutions within a legal agreement (or set of agreements) to a particular legal problem. This problem might consist of a need to match the particular objectives of counterparties in a discrete part of a bargain or to address certain legal rules. A particular contract pattern interlocks, nests, and works together with other contract patterns to solve more complex problems and create more elaborate bargains. Interlocking patterns enable scalability. If Alexander’s architectural patterns for rooms create patterns for buildings, which create patterns for neighborhoods and cities, then patterns of individual contract provisions together form patterns for larger legal agreements. Patterns for legal agreements, in turn, interlock to create patterns for transactions, which mesh to create patterns for markets. For example, contract patterns help lawyers draft real estate contracts. These contracts interlock in sophisticated real estate transactions, which mesh with other contract patterns to form securitization transactions. Securitization patterns create markets for asset-backed securities, which form {{part of the larger}} shadow banking system. This scalability differentiates contract patterns from boilerplate. However, legal scholarship on boilerplate – including Henry Smith’s work on the modularity of contract boilerplate – illuminates how contract patterns function and how they allow certain debt contracts to become what Gary Gorton calls 2 ̆ 2 informationally insensitive 2 ̆ 2 and to enjoy many of the economic features of money. The pattern language framework explains not only how sophisticated contracts function, but also how they fail. The pattern language framework provides a lens for examining recent contracts law scholarship on the failures of sophisticated contract design, including 2 ̆ 2 sticky 2 ̆ 2 contract provisions in sovereign bond agreements, 2 ̆ 2 Frankenstein 2 ̆ 2 contracts in mortgage-backed securitizations, and the 2 ̆ 2 flash crash. 2 ̆ 2 If modularity and contract design patterns foster the development of new financial instruments and markets, then their features can also contribute to the unraveling of these markets. For example, by restricting the information content of contracts, patterns and modularity not only midwifed the creation of liquid markets for those contracts, they also played a role in 2 ̆ 2 <b>shadow</b> <b>bank</b> runs 2 ̆ 2 and the catastrophic freezing of these markets. The failure of contract patterns can have systemic effects for entire markets when a particular contract enjoys widespread use or when it is so connected to other critical contracts that cascading failures occur. This essay was a contribution to a symposium for Larry Cunningham’s book, Contracts in the Real World...|$|E
40|$|This study {{provides}} an empirical analysis of <b>Shadow</b> <b>banking</b> {{as a factor}} influencing cross- border financial flows. It builds upon emerging literature on <b>Shadow</b> <b>banking</b> and empirical literature on global imbalances and global financial flows. The aim of the thesis is to test three hypotheses, which relate global financial flows to lending, change in cross-border <b>bank</b> liabilities, and <b>shadow</b> <b>banking,</b> respectively. The second and third hypotheses are tested on gross capital flows, which, in contrast to net flows, better reflect financing activities. The results suggest that <b>Shadow</b> <b>banking</b> activities are related to higher gross capital flows in periods, when this sector is growing. These flows, however, tend to dry up when <b>Shadow</b> <b>banking</b> activities level off or decline. Among other important factors is the output growth differential and global risk aversion.

40|$|<b>Shadow</b> <b>banking</b> {{is a part}} of the {{financial}} system, that operates similarly to the banking system, however, is typically less regulated. As a result of incorrect risk assessment and insufficient regulation, <b>shadow</b> <b>banking</b> played a significant part in the recent global financial crisis of 2007. My thesis consists of two major sections, in the first section I describe the <b>shadow</b> <b>banking</b> system, I assess its positive and negative features, and I describe the methods for mapping the <b>shadow</b> <b>banking</b> entities. In the second section, I conduct a risk assessment of major <b>shadow</b> <b>banking</b> entities. Based on the evidence I conclude, that even investments that appear risk free under standard market conditions are exposed to incorrect risk assessment, especially when investing into assets with complicated structure, furthermore, in time of systemic contagion, even healthy companies are exposed to runs and lack of credit available on the market to help fund their operations.

40|$|The {{system of}} {{non-bank}} financial intermediaries (NBFI; i. e., <b>shadow</b> <b>banks)</b> has grown rapidly {{in recent decades}} up to a roughly size of about Dollar 71 trillion. <b>Shadow</b> <b>banks</b> moved {{for a number of}} reasons into the focus of regulatory authorities: (1) the risks associated with circumventing existing rules and the accumulation of high levels of debt, (2) the growing size of the <b>shadow</b> <b>banking</b> system and its associated impact on the real economy and (3) risk stemming from the interconnection and interdependency of <b>banks</b> and <b>shadow</b> <b>banks.</b> The <b>shadow</b> <b>banking</b> system should be considered to be a part of a banking system that evolved out of the traditional banking system, and which combines traditional and innovative <b>banking.</b> The <b>shadow</b> <b>banking</b> system comprises institutions, such as finance companies; several managed funds; a complex array of instruments, such as Asset Backed Securities and repurchase agreements; and structures and markets that replicate core banking activities. Overall, a complex chain of multiple relations between a numbers of institutions has evolved. Each of these institutions performs a different part of the intermediation process. Therefore, it is important to understand the nexus within the <b>shadow</b> <b>banking</b> sector and connections with the traditional banking sector. This work will examine specific institutions involved in the <b>shadow</b> <b>banking</b> system and their development. Further, the scenario of a modern-type bank run within the MMF sector will identify potential weak points of the <b>shadow</b> <b>banking</b> system that should be addressed by financial regulation. The FSB was tasked to develop, in collaboration with other standard setting bodies, a policy framework to monitor and supervise <b>shadow</b> <b>banking</b> activities and entities. This work aims to structure and organize this proposed regulatory framework and reflects the recommendations regarding the stability of money market funds and their impact on financial stability critically...|$|R
