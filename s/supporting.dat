40|$|How do {{perceptions}} of being <b>supported</b> {{relate to the}} amount of social <b>support</b> received? Received and perceived <b>support</b> have generally been found to be only moderately related. Previous research has however focused on the amount of <b>support</b> received regardless of whether it was needed. We hypothesized that a measure of <b>support</b> received when needed would predict perceived <b>support</b> and well-being better than would an unqualified measure of received <b>support.</b> Study 1 found that correlations between received <b>support</b> and perceived <b>support</b> measures were, on average, twice as high when received <b>support</b> was measured as the proportion of times <b>support</b> was received when needed (average r =. 54) than when it was measured as the number of times <b>support</b> was received (average r =. 28). Similar results were found for correlations between received <b>support</b> and mental health which rose from r =. 04 to r =. 31 when need for <b>support</b> was considered. Study 2 replicated the strong relationship between <b>support</b> received when needed and both perceived <b>support</b> and mental health. Received <b>support</b> measures should be adapted to take the need for <b>support</b> into consideration in future investigation of these relationships. Social <b>support</b> interventions may only be beneficial if the recipient’s <b>support</b> needs are not already being met. ...|$|R

Methods: 131 patients (68 % females, mean age 45 years) participating in a 4 -week, inpatient, occupational rehabilitation program were included. All patients completed questionnaires on demographic variables, SHC, and social <b>support</b> (Social <b>Support</b> Inventory, SSI) received from rehabilitation staff and from <b>support</b> providers outside rehabilitation.

40|$|Social <b>support</b> is {{important}} to achieve beneficial changes in risk factors for disease, such as overweight and obesity. This paper presents the theoretical and practical framework for social <b>support,</b> and the mechanisms by which social <b>support</b> affects body weight. The theoretical and practical framework is <b>supported</b> with a literature review addressing studies involving a social <b>support</b> intervention for weight loss and weight loss maintenance. A major aspect in social <b>support</b> research and practice is the distinction between structural and functional <b>support.</b> Structural <b>support</b> refers to the availability of potential support-givers, while functional <b>support</b> refers to the perception of <b>support.</b> Interventions often affect structural <b>support,</b> for example, through peer groups, yet functional <b>support</b> shows a stronger correlation with health. Although positive correlations between social <b>support</b> and health have been shown, social <b>support</b> may also counteract health behaviour change. Most interventions discussed in this review showed positive health outcomes. Surprisingly, social <b>support</b> was clearly defined on a practical level in hardly any studies, and social <b>support</b> was assessed as an outcome variable in even fewer studies. Future social <b>support</b> intervention research would benefit from clear definitions of social <b>support,</b> a clear description of the intended mechanism of action and the actual intervention, and the inclusion of perceived social <b>support</b> as a study outcom...|$|R
