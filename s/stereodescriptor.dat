50|$|The {{research}} on mifepristone analogs, mainly {{focused on the}} improvement of the ratio of antiprogestational/antiglucocorticoid activity, led to the discovery of SPRMs. Modifications of or near the 17-alpha propinyl group (Fig. 4) on the D ring {{play a key role in}} binding to the progesterone receptor and/or glucocorticoid receptor. Minor changes in the 17-alpha region generate antiprogestins with reduced antiglucocorticoidal activity, where alpha refers to an absolute steroidal <b>stereodescriptor.</b> It seems that hydrophobic 17-alpha substituents such as 17-alpha ethyl and 17-alpha (1´-pentynyl) give rise to antiprogestational activity superior to that of mifepristone. Substitution on the 17-alpha position involving phenyl group with small, electron-withdrawing substituents, such as F and CF3, on the para-position was also found to greatly increase the selectivity over glucocorticoid receptor as well as the potency of resulting compounds. Same substitution at the ortho- or meta- position led to decrease in selectivity. Bulky substituents, such as tert-butyl, in this region decrease the progesterone potency.|$|E

50|$|Two anomers are {{designated}} alpha (α) or beta (β), {{according to the}} configurational relationship between the anomeric centre and the anomeric reference atom, hence they are relative <b>stereodescriptors.</b>|$|R
50|$|To {{designate}} two anomers {{the relative}} <b>stereodescriptors</b> alpha (α) and beta (β) are used. In the α anomer the anomeric carbon atom and the reference atom do have opposite configurations (R,S or S,R), {{whereas in the}} β anomer {{they are the same}} (both R or both S).|$|R
50|$|A {{descriptor}} is {{in chemical}} nomenclature a prefix placed before the systematic substance name, which describes the configuration or the stereochemistry of the molecule. Some listed descriptors are only of historical interest {{and should not}} be used in publications anymore as they do not correspond with the modern recommendations of the IUPAC. <b>Stereodescriptors</b> are often used in combination with locants to clearly identify a chemical structure unambiguously.|$|R
40|$|A new {{effective}} algorithm {{for handling}} of geometry at chiral centers for {{the processing of}} stereochemical structures during their unambiguous registration in databases was designed, programmed and implemented. The chemical and mathematical reasoning behind the algorithm are discussed in detail. Its advantages- {{in comparison to the}} methods used so far - are illustrated for the manual {{as well as for the}} computerassisted assignment of <b>stereodescriptors</b> based on the CIP ranking procedure...|$|R
