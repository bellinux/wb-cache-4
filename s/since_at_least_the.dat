5|$|Ancient stone {{structures}} {{testify to}} the presence of Stroma's earliest residents, while a Norse presence around 900–1,000 years ago is recorded in the Orkneyinga Saga. It has been politically united with Caithness <b>since</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>the</b> 15th century. Although Stroma lies only a few miles off the Scottish coast, the savage weather and ferociously strong tides of the Pentland Firth meant that the island's inhabitants were very isolated, causing them to be largely self-sufficient, trading agricultural produce and fish with the mainlanders.|$|E

5|$|Coal {{had been}} mined at Bradford <b>since</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>the</b> early 17th century, when {{the area around}} the pits was largely rural; it became {{increasingly}} built-up and industrialised as nearby Manchester expanded during the 19th century. Coal was transported from the colliery by canal and railway, but most was consumed locally by the adjacent Bradford Ironworks. In the mid-20th century a 469-yard (420 m) underground tunnel was dug to supply coal directly to the Stuart Street Power Station.|$|E
5|$|Coal {{has been}} mined in Ashton <b>since</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>the</b> 17th century. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries demand for coal increased, {{which led to}} an {{expansion}} of the town's coal industry. The produce of the collieries was transported by canal to Manchester. The industry began to decline during the late 19th century, and by 1904 only the Ashton Moss Colliery was still operational, the last colliery to be opened in the area.|$|E

Silicon compounds such as silicones, silanes, silsesquioxane, silica and silicates, some of which were developed as alternatives to more toxic halogenated products, can considerably improve the flame retardancy of plastic materials.|$|E

These animals are typically captured from the wild when they are 10–20 years old when they can be trained quickly and easily, and will have a longer working life. They were traditionally captured with traps and lassos, but since 1950, tranquillisers have been used.|$|E
5|$|Human {{beekeeping}} or apiculture {{has been}} practised for millennia, <b>since</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>the</b> times of Ancient Egypt and Ancient Greece.
