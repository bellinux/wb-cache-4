60|$|Jumping down, he {{went along}} {{the track and}} stopped in the strong light a blast-lamp threw across a gap. The {{road-bed}} was gone and a great bank of stones and snow rested on the hillside. Bent rails slanted into the hole and a broken telegraph pole hung by the tangled wires.

60|$|The {{light was}} fading {{down in the}} deep rift when, winding round a spur through a tangle of {{clinging}} underbrush, they saw the timber thin off ahead. In a few minutes Vane stopped with an exclamation, and Carroll, overtaking him, loosened his pack.

60|$|He heard {{shouts and}} mocking laughter, and looked up. The {{governor}} of the African jail was running along the road, his face red, and wet by sweat; Bones' small cap occupied ridiculously {{the back of his}} head. His white jacket had lost some buttons and blew open; his thin, red slippers were trodden down at the heels. He laboured on with stern resolution, looking straight in front. Behind came a swarm of ragged children, pelting him with <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> <b>stones.</b>|$|E
60|$|They set to work, and it {{was late}} in the {{afternoon}} when, stripped to shirt and trousers and dripping with perspiration, Joe stopped for a few moments to look about. Thirty feet behind him the creek swirled furiously around a rocky head, the steep face of which was fumed and scarred by giant-powder. A stake was driven into the crest of the promontory, another could be seen a short distance back, and straggling jack-pines and spruces followed the edge of the bank. The ground had been disturbed all round and was strewn with piles of <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> <b>stones.</b>|$|E

60|$|He stepped {{cautiously}} {{over the}} edge of the descent, and went down a few yards with a run, while loosened <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> <b>stones</b> slipped away under him. Then he clutched a slender tree, and proceeded as far as the next on his hands and knees. After that it was necessary to swing himself over a ledge, and he alighted safely on one below, from which he could scramble down to the narrow strip of gravel between rock and water. He was standing, breathless, looking at the latter, when Vane joined him. The stones dipped sharply, and two or three large boulders, ringed about with froth, rose near the middle of the stream, which seemed to be running slacker on the other side of them.|$|E

60|$|The deer rose once more, and, {{though only}} a yard or two away, he could {{scarcely}} see it. His eyes seemed clouded, {{and he was}} gasping heavily. Whether he dropped the rifle with intent or stumbled and let it slip he never knew, but in another moment he had flung himself upon the deer with the long knife in his hand. Then his feet slipped, and he and the beast rolled down a slope together. The blade he gripped struck <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> <b>stones,</b> but at length {{he knew that it}} had gone in to the hilt in yielding flesh, and with a tense effort he buried it again. After that he staggered clear, half-dazed, but exultant, with a broad crimson stain on the rags he wore. The beast's limbs and body quivered once or twice, and then it lay very still.|$|E

60|$|Two {{or three}} minutes later, however, the sound he was {{beginning}} to dread once more reached him, breaking in upon the crackle of dry sticks under his horse's hoofs and the crash he made as he now and then blundered into a brake or thicket. It was very dark in the bluff; he could scarcely see the spectral trunks of the flitting trees, and to pick the way or avoid the obstacles around which the trail here and there twisted was out of the question. He faced the hazards as they came and rode savagely; but the thud of pursuing hoofs and the smashing and crackling which mingled with it sounded very close when he reached the brink of a ravine which he understood it was almost impossible to descend on horseback. To dismount would, however, as he realized, entail his capture; and setting his lips tight he drove the failing horse at the almost precipitous gully. They plunged down with <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> <b>stones</b> sliding and rattling after them, splashed into a creek, and were half-way up the opposite side when a second clatter of falling stones was followed by a heavy downward rush of loosened soil. Then there was a dull thud and afterward a curiously impressive silence.|$|E

40|$|The <b>soil</b> fungal {{diversity}} <b>and</b> community partitioning {{between the}} bulk <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> <b>stone</b> compartments was investigated using PCR based approaches targeting the barcoding {{internal transcribed spacer}} (ITS) of rDNA and the laccase encoding functional gene as genetic markers. Soil samples were collected from the B-horizon of spruce and beech forests at the Hainich Biodiversity Exploratory, central Germany. The targeted markers were amplified from the respective DNA extracts using general fungal primers and basidiomycete laccase gene specific primers, cloned and sequenced. Differences in the fungal community composition between the two forest types <b>and</b> the <b>soil</b> compartments were indicated by both markers. When the effects of ecological factors were considered, the two markers produced different patterns of results. The ITS rDNA marker revealed communities principally influenced by forest type, while those detected with the functional marker were mainly affected by soil pH. The fungal communities detected by the functional marker in particular, differed significantly between <b>soils</b> <b>and</b> <b>stones,</b> indicating that laccase-producing fungi are specifically adapted to degrade organic matter in soils rather than weathering of stones. The study underlines the fact that coherent and complementary results may be obtained with both genetic markers used. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|The {{main reason}} for the entrance-way being built above ground level was to {{maintain}} the structural integrity of the building rather than for defence.

Special footwear, including combat boots or so-called [...] "blast boots", is only moderately protective against the destructive effects of blast mines, and the loss of a foot is a typical outcome.|$|E
50|$|The plumage of the pipits is {{generally}} drab and brown, buff or faded white.

The drab mottled brown colours provide some camouflage against the <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> <b>stones</b> they are generally found on. A few species have slightly more colourful breeding plumages, for example the rosy pipit has greenish edges on the wing feathers. The yellow-breasted pipit, if it is retained in this genus, is quite atypical in having bright yellow plumage on the throat breast and belly.|$|E

30|$|Deb et al. [4] {{proposed}} a mechanical model {{to predict the}} behavior of a geosynthetic reinforced granular fill over soft soil improved with end bearing granular piles. The granular layer, surrounding <b>soil,</b> <b>and</b> <b>stone</b> columns were idealized by Pasternak shear layer, Kelvin-Voight model, and stiffer Winkler spring, respectively. The plane strain condition was considered in the analysis and the finite difference scheme is used to solve the governing differential equations. Nonlinear behaviors of soft <b>soil</b> <b>and</b> the granular fill were considered. For a uniformly loaded strip footing, the presence of granular layer helps to transfer stress from soil to granular piles and reduce maximum and differential settlements [3, 4].|$|R
