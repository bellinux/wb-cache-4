5|$|In 2013, the MTA filed {{to change}} the {{location}} of Entrance 1, moving it onto from the <b>sidewalk,</b> away from its original proposed location inside 301 East 69th Street. This was because designs for entrances inside the building failed to both satisfy the building's residents as well as meet the MTA's engineering requirements. With the New York City Department of Transportation planning a bike lane along {{the east side of}} Second Avenue after construction is finished, the MTA could widen the <b>sidewalk</b> {{to make room for the}} entrances without ultimately disrupting traffic flow.|$|E
5|$|In November 2014, the bid {{was awarded}} to the {{consortium}} CityBridge, which consists of Qualcomm, Titan, Control Group, and Comark.

It also has a <b>sidewalk,</b> which connects to Sheet Harbour's current <b>sidewalk</b> system. Officials hope this will encourage active transportation.|$|E

50|$|In the {{broadest}} sense, building codes that {{limit the number}} of driveways that cross <b>sidewalks</b> may be viewed as making the <b>sidewalks</b> a separation structure.|$|R
50|$|The borough {{accepted}} {{public water}} in September 1896. Electric streetlights were installed after much discussion in 1915. Before that, gas lamps {{were used to}} light the streets. Over the years, boardwalks were replaced by bricks, then by concrete <b>sidewalks.</b> There are still two brick <b>sidewalks</b> in the borough.

50|$|In 2000, the IRI {{took the}} U.S. Postal Service to the U.S. Court {{of appeals for}} the right to collect {{signatures}} on <b>sidewalks</b> in front of post office. In Initiative & Referendum Institute v U.S. Postal Service, the court found that <b>sidewalks</b> that were parallel to the street were public but that <b>sidewalks</b> leading into buildings could not be used for campaigning.|$|R

In summer 2016, the city of Columbus, Ohio, was announced as {{the winner of the}} Smart City Challenge. Intersection has proposed installing Links in four Columbus neighborhoods.|$|E
50|$|In 1992, he {{presented}} {{a motion to}} City Council to adopt a by-law prohibiting anyone from lying, sleeping or blocking city <b>sidewalks.</b> He argued that the city paid {{millions of dollars to}} make sufficient beds available for the homeless and {{there was no need for}} anyone to lie or sleep on the <b>sidewalks.</b> The motion lost and sleeping on the <b>sidewalks</b> has remained part of the landscape in downtown Toronto streets.|$|R
50|$|During {{the first}} six years, the show was known as <b>Sidewalks.</b> The {{producers}} decided to add Entertainment to the program's title, so viewers would understand it was an entertainment show and not a show related to public works or about concrete walkways. On websites and television grids, the program is listed as <b>Sidewalks</b> Entertainment, although hosts, guests and on-air graphics may still refer to the program as <b>Sidewalks.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{presence}} of <b>sidewalks</b> is commonly {{touted as a}} critical component of walkability in residential developments (Jacobs 1961; Krier 1979; Trancik 1986; Barnette 1995). Systematic observations of various suburban areas with <b>sidewalks</b> in New Bern did not yield sufficient evidence indicating that <b>sidewalks</b> on their own generate pedestrian movement. Furthermore, a host of recent empirical investigations from the public and environmental health fields, pointed to the lack of causality between neighborhood <b>sidewalks</b> and walkability. Most of these studies noted that the {{presence of}} <b>sidewalks</b> is positively correlated with walking. They generally explained such associations in terms of the market self-selection process, i.e., people who like walking commonly choose to live in places that support their way of life (Cervero and Duncan 2003; Atkinson et al. 2004; Reed et al. 2006; Oaks et al. 2007; Lovasi et al. 2008; Nagel et al. 2008).|$|R

A plaque outlining Sarria's accomplishments {{is embedded in the}} <b>sidewalk</b> in front of the Harvey Milk Memorial Branch of the San Francisco Public Library, which is located at 1 JosÃ© Sarria Court.|$|E

The Embassy of Ecuador suffered structural damage, including three collapsed chimneys and cracked internal walls. The Treasury Building suffered minor damage to exterior railings, {{some of which}} {{fell to the ground}} and caused closure of a <b>sidewalk.</b> Fire department officials in Washington reported numerous minor injuries {{as a result of the}} earthquake.|$|E
5|$|The next day, {{peaceful}} protests {{continued in}} front of the Consulate of Sri Lanka on the <b>sidewalk</b> of Spadina Avenue and at Queen's Park simultaneously. York Regional Police, Peel Regional Police, the OPP and the RCMP continued to help Toronto Police Service to prevent civil diobedience as what had happened the previous night. Toronto Mayor David Miller urged that such tactics as blockading the Gardiner Expressway not be used again. Police officials decried the use of children during such dangerous tactics.|$|E
25|$|When Cottage Home was built, {{high-quality}} brick <b>sidewalks</b> and limestone curbs {{lined the}} streets.

Piedmont Road, Evans Road, and Jacklin Road have {{excellent}} bike lanes and <b>sidewalks</b> with ample spacing, but Montague Expressway and South Milpitas Boulevard have limited <b>sidewalks</b> and narrow bike lanes, which causes some problems for workers commuting by bike or on foot. The roads most favorable for recreational jogging and biking are Evans and Piedmont Roads.|$|R

The Willkie boys had a <b>sidewalk</b> fight with Republican youths, and though the Willkies won their battle, Bryan did not, defeated by former Ohio governor William McKinley. When Bryan ran again in 1900, he stayed overnight at the Willkie home, and the Democratic candidate for president became the first political hero for the boy who would later seek that office.|$|E

This led to the amputation of his toe, his departure from the nomenclature firm, and the beginning of his hermetic lifestyle.|$|E
50|$|Belgrano's <b>sidewalks</b> {{are often}} busy with dogwalkers. Even though city {{ordinances}} forbid {{more than ten}} dogs to a person, {{it is not uncommon}} to see double that number - which contributes to the dog-waste problem plaguing many <b>sidewalks.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the United Kingdom, Australia and France {{suburban}} <b>sidewalks</b> {{are most}} commonly constructed of tarmac. In urban or inner-city areas <b>sidewalks</b> are most commonly constructed of slabs, stone, or brick {{depending upon the}} surrounding street architecture and furniture.|$|R
