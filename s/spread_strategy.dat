40|$|In {{this thesis}} we explore four new {{applications}} of the Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (LETKF), namely adaptive observations, analysis sensitivity, observation impact, and multivariate humidity assimilation. In each of these applications we have obtained promising results. In the adaptive observation studies, we found that ensemble <b>spread</b> <b>strategy,</b> where adaptive observations are selected among the points with largest ensemble spread (with the constraint that observations cannot be contiguous {{in order to avoid}} clusters of adaptive observations) is very effective and close to optimal sampling. The application on simulated Doppler Wind Lidar (DWL) adaptive observation studies shows that 3 D-Var is as effective as LETKF with 10 % adaptive observations sampled with the ensemble <b>spread</b> <b>strategy.</b> With 2 % adaptive observations, 3 D-Var is not as effective as the LETKF. In the analysis sensitivity study, we proposed to calculate this quantity within the LETKF with low additional computational time.

40|$|Adoption or {{rejection}} of ideas, products, and technologies {{in a society}} is often governed by simultaneous propagation {{of positive and negative}} influences. Consider a planner trying to introduce an idea in different parts of a society at different times. How should the planner design a schedule considering this fact that positive reaction to the idea in early areas has a positive impact on probability of success in later areas, whereas a flopped reaction has exactly the opposite impact? We generalize a well-known economic model which has been recently used by Chierichetti, Kleinberg, and Panconesi (ACM EC' 12). In this model the reaction of each area is determined by its initial preference and the reaction of early areas. We generalize previous works by studying the problem when people in different areas have various behaviors. We first prove, independent of the planner's schedule, influences help (resp., hurt) the planner to propagate her idea if it is an appealing (resp., unappealing) idea. We also study the problem of designing the optimal non-adaptive <b>spreading</b> <b>strategy.</b> In the non-adaptive <b>spreading</b> <b>strategy,</b> the schedule is fixed at the beginning and is never changed. Whereas, in adaptive <b>spreading</b> <b>strategy</b> the planner decides about the next move based on {{the current state of the}} cascade. We demonstrate that it is hard to propose a non-adaptive <b>spreading</b> <b>strategy</b> in general. Nevertheless, we propose an algorithm to find the best non-adaptive <b>spreading</b> <b>strategy</b> when probabilities of different behaviors of people in various areas drawn i. i. d from an unknown distribution.

Plausible risk measures give price bounds that are suitable for use as bid-ask prices. Furthermore, the risk measures {{should be able to}} compensate for the unhedgeable risk to an extent. Conic finance provides plausible bid-ask prices that are determined by the probability distribution of the cash flows only. We apply the theory to obtain bid-ask prices in the assessment of the risks of trading strategies.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} trading strategies which {{capture the}} various risk premiums {{that have been}} distinguished in futures markets. On {{the basis of a}} simple decomposition of futures returns, we show that the return on a short-term futures contract measures the spot-futures pre-mium, while <b>spreading</b> <b>strategies</b> isolate the term premiums. Using a broad cross-section of futures markets and delivery horizons, we ex-amine the components of futures risk premiums by means of passive trading strategies and active trading strategies which intend to ex-ploit the predictable variation in futures returns. We find that passive strategies which capture the spot-futures premium do not yield abnor-mal returns, in contrast to passive <b>spreading</b> <b>strategies</b> which isolate the term premiums. The term structure of futures yields has strong explanatory power for both spot and term premiums, which can be ex-ploited using active trading strategies that go long in low-yield markets and short in high-yield markets. The profitability of these yield-based trading strategies is not due to systematic risk. Furthermore, we find that spreading returns are predictable by net hedge demand observed in the past, which can be exploited by active trading. Finally, there is momentum in futures markets, but momentum strategies do not outperform benchmark portfolios. JEL classification: G 13...|$|R

The results from simulated experiments show that the trace of analysis sensitivity qualitatively reflects the observation impact obtained from independently computed data addition or data denial OSSE experiments. In the observation impact study, we derived a formula to estimate the impact of observations on short-range forecasts as in Langland and Baker (2004), but without using an adjoint model. Both methods estimate more than 90 % accuracy the actual observation impact on the short-range forecast error improvement. Like the adjoint method, the method we proposed detects observations that have either large random error or unaccounted bias. This method can be easily calculated within the LETKF, and provides a powerful tool to estimate the quality of observations. Finally, for the first time, we assimilate humidity observations multivariately in both perfect model experiments and real data assimilation. We found that multivariate assimilation is better than univariate assimilation. The assimilation of pseudo-RH (Dee and da Silva, 2003) is better than the choice of specific humidity and relative humidity.

The problem of scheduling the application across distributed resources is termed as co-allocation. In a grid context, co-allocation is difficult since the grid middleware must face a dynamic environment. Middleware architecture on a Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) basis have been proposed to tackle most limitations of centralized systems. Some of the issues addressed by P 2 P systems are fault tolerance, ease of maintenance, and scalability in resource discovery. However, the lack of global knowledge makes scheduling difficult in P 2 P systems. In this paper, we present the new developments concerning locality awareness as well as co-allocation strategies available in the latest release of P 2 P-MPI. i) The <b>spread</b> <b>strategy</b> tries to map processes on hosts so as to maximize {{the total amount of}} available memory while maintaining locality of processes as a secondary objective. ii) The concentrate strategy tries to maximize locality between processes by using as many cores as hosts offer.

This article addresses an underexplored topic, namely the use of QICs as ‘intentional <b>spread</b> <b>strategy.</b> ’ Its objective is to predict the dissemination of projects within hospitals participating in a change programme based on several QICs. We tested whether the average project success at QIC level (based on opinions of individual project team leaders) explains the dissemination of projects one year later. Findings: After one year, 148 project team leaders of 16 hospitals participating in the two-year programme were asked to rate the success of their improvement project on a scale from 1 to 10. At {{the end of the second}} year, the programme coordinator of each hospital provided information on the second-year dissemination. Average success scores and dissemination statistics were calculated for each QIC (N[*]=[*] 12). The non-parametric correlation between team leader judgment and dissemination rate at QIC level is 0. 73 (P[*]<[*] 0. 01). Conclusions: Previous work, focusing on the team and hospital level, showed which factors contributed to local success stories. It also illustrated how successes play a role in dissemination processes within programme hospitals. The current study suggests that we cannot ignore the extent to which the dissemination potential of individual projects is defined by their QIC. Aggregated team leader judgments at the QIC level might predict the future dissemination in participating organizations. The findings, however, need to be replicated in larger, independent samples.

Despite some opinions that say that financial derivatives cause deformations in prices at financial markets, volume of sales of financial derivatives are annually rising. Financial derivatives brought with themselves large opportunities for position creating. They can be used not only for trading, but for hedging and arbitrage as well. Nowadays, financial derivatives, namely options, are used to provide new banking products of treasury management. Yields of treasury in- struments are in certain way derived from the yields gained from other regular financial instruments on financial market. Banks use option strategies to create financial positions that are divided into smaller parts and, consecutively, sold to clients of banks as new products. Especially, option strategies are used to emit investments certificates. Situation on financial markets forces banks to create new products that bring higher potential profits at lower level of risk.
