500|$|Filmmakers, {{crew members}} and co-stars {{tend to agree}} that Pfeiffer is {{extremely}} [...] "committed" [...] to her work, developing a [...] "reputation for competence, control, and hyper-preparation". At times Pfeiffer {{has been described as}} difficult to work with, particularly by Robert Towne, who directed her in Tequila Sunrise; Towne famously dubbed Pfeiffer [...] "the most difficult actress in Hollywood". On this designation, Pfeiffer admitted that she can seem difficult at times but it mostly [...] "depends on whom you talk to." [...] Famous for being very [...] "press-shy" [...] and private, much like the characters she portrays on-screen, Pfeiffer is notorious for disliking interviews. In a 2017 interview with Interview magazine, the actress warned her interviewer, director Darren Aronofsky, that she is [...] "the worst interviewee that ever was"; her interviews often feature discussions about how much she dislikes being interviewed because the process makes her nervous. Pfeiffer revealed that {{there was a time when}} attending interviews to promote her films would make her very agitated and uncomfortable, but she has always [...] "mastered the art" [...] of maintaining a composed, polite demeanor when performing such responsibilities. However, she maintains that [...] "I still don't believe – and I never will – that it's the actors' responsibility to sell a film." [...] The actress resembles an [...] "intense conversationalist" [...] in her interviews, tending to <b>scrunch</b> her face and narrow her eyes before responding to questions. Pfeiffer always discards old scripts in which she has written extensive notes about her characters, nor does she retain film reviews, magazine clippings or covers about her work or performances.|$|E

'As to Rokesmith, {{that young}} man of mine,' said Mr Boffin, {{dropping}} his voice and glancing towards the door with an apprehension of being overheard by some eavesdropper there, 'it's the same with him as with the footmen. I have found out that you must either <b>scrunch</b> them, or let them <b>scrunch</b> you. If you ain't imperious with 'em, they won't believe in your being any better than themselves, if as good, after the stories (lies mostly) that they have heard of your beginnings. There's nothing betwixt stiffening yourself up, and throwing yourself away; {{take my word for}} that, old lady.' ...|$|E
60|$|The car {{had to be}} backed a {{few yards}} {{in the process of}} turning. Very stealthily, very gently, very mercilessly Victor sent Morlvera flying over his shoulder, so that she fell into the road just behind the retrogressing wheel. With a soft, pleasant-sounding <b>scrunch</b> the car went over the {{prostrate}} form, then it moved forward again with another <b>scrunch.</b> The carriage moved off and left Bert and Emmeline gazing in scared delight at a sorry mess of petrol-smeared velvet, sawdust, and leopard skin, which was all that remained of the hateful Morlvera. They gave a shrill cheer, and then raced away shuddering from the scene of so much rapidly enacted tragedy.|$|E
50|$|A 2006 {{paper that}} {{demonstrated}} {{the involvement of}} DNA <b>scrunching</b> in initial transcription proposed {{the idea that the}} stress incurred during DNA <b>scrunching</b> provides the driving force for both abortive initiation and productive initiation. A companion paper published the same year confirmed that detectable DNA <b>scrunching</b> occurs in 80% of transcription cycles, and is actually estimated to be 100%, given the limitation of the ability to detect rapid <b>scrunching</b> (20% of <b>scrunches</b> have a duration of less than 1 second).|$|R
40|$|Using single-molecule DNA nanomanipulation, we {{show that}} {{abortive}} initiation involves DNA "scrunching"-in which RNA polymerase (RNAP) remains stationary and unwinds and pulls downstream DNA into itself-and that <b>scrunching</b> requires RNA synthesis and depends on RNA length. We show further that promoter escape involves <b>scrunching,</b> and that <b>scrunching</b> occurs in most or all instances of promoter escape. Our results support {{the existence of an}} obligatory stressed intermediate, with approximately one turn of additional DNA unwinding, in escape and are consistent with the proposal that stress in this intermediate provides the driving force to break RNAP-promoter and RNAP-initiation-factor interactions in escape...|$|R
50|$|A 2016 paper {{showed that}} DNA <b>scrunching</b> also occurs before RNA {{synthesis}} during transcription start site selection.|$|R

60|$|His face got all grey {{instead of}} being red like it was {{and there was a}} fly walking over it up to his eye. The <b>scrunch</b> that was when they were {{screwing}} the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were bringing it downstairs.|$|E
60|$|The {{spring of}} 1803 {{was an early}} one, and the middle of April saw the leaves thick upon the {{chestnut}} trees. One evening we were all seated together over a dish of tea when we heard the <b>scrunch</b> of steps outside our door, {{and there was the}} postman with a letter in his hand.|$|E
25|$|Mechanistically, {{promoter}} escape occurs through DNA <b>scrunching,</b> {{providing the}} energy needed to break interactions between RNA polymerase holoenzyme and the promoter.|$|R

6000|$|... "Fortunately {{there was}} no time," [...] George said with a smile. [...] "Don't you fret yourself, Bill; one can get on well enough without a foot, and it didn't hurt me a bit coming off. No, nor the squeeze either, not regular hurting; {{it was just a}} sort of <b>scrunch,</b> and then I didn't feel {{anything}} more. Why, I have often hurt myself ten times as much at play and thought nothing of it. I expect it looked much worse to you than it felt to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|He was panting and {{straining}} like a lion. Another {{moment and}} his hand {{would have been in}} mine, but at that moment I beheld the double rows of horrid teeth close upon him. He uttered a piercing shriek, and there was an indescribably horrible <b>scrunch</b> as he went down. In a moment after, he re-appeared, and making a last frightful effort to gain the rocks, caught my hand. I dragged him out of danger instantly, and then I found, to my unutterable joy, that the shark had only bitten off the half of his wooden leg! ...|$|E
6000|$|Clive {{told me of}} {{this little}} circumstance, and I am sorry to say of his own {{subsequent}} ill behaviour. [...] "We were standing apart from the ladies," [...] so Clive narrated, [...] "when Barnes and I had our little passage-of-arms. He had tried the finger business upon me before, and I had before told him, either to shake hands or to leave it alone. You know {{the way in which}} the impudent little beggar stands astride, and sticks his little feet out. I brought my heel well down on his confounded little varnished toe, and gave it a <b>scrunch</b> which made Mr. Barnes shriek out one of his loudest oaths." ...|$|E

50|$|Bodystockings are put {{on through}} the neck, in a similar {{technique}} to putting {{on a pair of}} tights: the body and arm sections are rolled down and then the legs are <b>scrunched</b> up like stockings; one would put one foot in and pull the stocking part up, and then the same on the other leg; from the waist, the bodystocking is pulled up over the torso to the chest, and then the arms are <b>scrunched</b> up and put on in same way as the legs; and the garment is then adjusted as required, and any ribbons and fasteners tied.|$|R
60|$|To the last, the Yard puts a quiet face upon it; for I {{make my way}} to {{the gates}} through a little quiet grove of trees, shading the quaintest of Dutch landing-places, where the leaf-speckled shadow of a {{shipwright}} just passing away at the further end might be the shadow of Russian Peter himself. So, the doors of the great patent safe at last close upon me, and I take boat again: somehow, thinking as the oars dip, of braggart Pistol and his brood, and of the quiet monsters of the Yard, with their 'We don't particularly want to do it; but if it must be done--!' <b>Scrunch.</b>|$|E

I took her in my lap, and the surgeon sponged off the blood and took a needle and thread and began to sew it up; {{it had to have}} a lot of stitches, and each one made her <b>scrunch</b> a little, but she never let go a sound. At last the surgeon was so full of admiration that he said, 'Well, you ARE a brave little thing!' and she said, just as ca'm and simple as if she was talking about the weather, 'There isn't anybody braver but the Cid!' You see? it was the boy-twin that the surgeon was a-dealing with.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, indeed. Mrs. Pendennis {{corresponds}} with her?" [...] says our host, darkling under his eyebrows; and, at this moment, my neighbour, F. B., is {{kind enough to}} <b>scrunch</b> my foot under {{the table with the}} weight of his heel, as much as to warn me, by an appeal to my own corns, to avoid treading on so delicate a subject in that house. [...] "Yes," [...] said I, in spite, perhaps in consequence, of this interruption. [...] "My wife does correspond with Miss Ethel, who is a noble creature, and whom those who know her know how to love and admire. She is very much changed since you knew her, Colonel Newcome; since the misfortunes in Sir Barnes's family, and the differences between you and him. Very much changed and very much improved. Ask my wife about her, who knows her most intimately, and hears from her constantly." ...|$|E
60|$|When {{we got to}} Owlwood I left Dick in the parlour {{and flew}} up to Aunt Tommy's room. I found her all <b>scrunched</b> up on her bed in the dark with {{her face in the}} pillows.|$|R
60|$|That hideous noise--the <b>scrunching</b> {{of a human}} bone--was {{drowned in}} tumultuous applause as the miserable wretch with the maimed and {{bleeding}} leg, but with that almighty instinct for life at any cost, toiled mangled and bleeding up that ladder less crimson than the trail which he left in his wake.|$|R
60|$|That's {{pleasant}} for them. You know, men {{and women}} without end have snapped their fingers at society and laughed at it, {{and for a while}} thought they had the better of it. But all the time society was quietly smiling up its sleeve, and suddenly it put out an iron hand--and <b>scrunched</b> them up.|$|R
60|$|At length {{the light}} began to fade, {{and for that}} day their {{experiments}} were over. In token of their conclusion twice Stella rang the electric warning bell which {{was attached to the}} aerophone, and in some mysterious manner caused the bell of its twin instrument to ring also. Then she packed the apparatus in its box, for, with its batteries, it was too heavy and too delicate to be carried conveniently, locking it up, and left the church, which she also locked behind her. Outside it was still snowing fast, but softly, for the wind had dropped, and a sharp frost was setting in, causing the fallen snow to <b>scrunch</b> beneath her feet. About half-way along the bleak line of deserted cliff which stretched from the Dead Church to the first houses of Monksland, she saw the figure of a man walking swiftly towards her, and knew from the bent head and broad, slightly stooping shoulders that it was Morris coming to escort her home. Presently they met.|$|E
6000|$|Her sister, Miss Watson, a {{tolerable}} slim old maid, with goggles on, {{had just}} come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a spelling-book. She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then the widow made her ease up. I couldn't stood it much longer. Then for an hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety. Miss Watson would say, [...] "Don't put your feet up there, Huckleberry;" [...] and [...] "Don't <b>scrunch</b> up like that, Huckleberry--set up straight;" [...] and pretty soon she would say, [...] "Don't gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry--why don't you try to behave?" [...] Then she {{told me all about}} the bad place, and I said I wished I was there. She got mad then, but I didn't mean no harm. All I wanted was to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn't particular. She said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn't say it for the whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place. Well, I couldn't see no advantage in going where she was going, so I made up my mind I wouldn't try for it. But I never said so, because it would only make trouble, and wouldn't do no good.|$|E

60|$|Presently {{it seemed}} to her that above the gentle clapper of the waters she could hear a rustle and the <b>scrunching</b> of the fine gravel under {{carefully}} measured footsteps.
