40|$|Distributed {{generation}} (DG) {{may play}} a key role in a modern energy system because it can improve energy efficiency. Reductions in the energy bill, and therefore DG attractiveness, depend on the electricity tariff structure; a system created before widespread adoption of distributed generation. Tariffs have been designed to recover costs equitably amongst customers with similar consumption patterns. Recently, electric utilities began to question the equity of this electricity pricing structure for standby service. In particular, the utilities do not feel that DG customers are paying their fair share of transmission and distribution costs - traditionally recovered through a volumetric ($/kWh) mechanism - under existing tariff structures. In response, new tariff structures with higher fixed costs for DG have been implemented in New York and in California. This work analyzes the effects of different electricity tariff structures on DG adoption. First, the effects of the new standby tariffs in New York are analyzed in different regions. Next generalized tariffs are constructed, and the sensitivity to varying levels of the volumetric and the demand ($/kW, i. e. maximum rate) charge component are analyzed on New York s standard and <b>standby</b> <b>tariff</b> as well as California's <b>standby</b> <b>tariff.</b> As expected, DG profitability is reduced with standby tariffs, but often marginally. The new standby structures tend to promote smaller base load systems. The amount of time-of-day variability of volumetric pricing seems to have little effect on DG economics...|$|E
40|$|This project evaluates what $/kW subsidy on microturbines (MT's) {{makes them}} {{economically}} competitive with natural gas internal combustion engines (ICE's). The Distributed Energy Resources Customer Adoption Model (DER-CAM) {{is used to}} determine least cost solutions, including distributed generation (DG) investment and operation, to sites' energy demands. The first site considered is a hospital in New York City. The small hospital (90 beds) has a peak electric load (including cooling) of 1200 kW, with heat loads comparable to electric loads. Consolidated Edison electricity and natural gas tariffs for 2003 are used. A 60 % minimum DG system efficiency is imposed on DG operation to avoid the <b>standby</b> <b>tariff,</b> which is less amenable to DG than the parent tariff. The second site considered is the Naval Base Ventura County commissary in Southern California. The commissary has 13, 000 m{sup 2 } of floor space and contains a large retail store, supermarket, food court, and other small businesses. The site peak electric load (including cooling) is 1050 kW. Electricity and natural gas supply are from direct access contracts, and delivery service is provided by Southern California Edison and Southern California Gas, respectively. 2003 supply and delivery rates are used...|$|E
40|$|Improvements in technology, low {{natural gas}} prices, and more {{flexible}} and positive attitudes {{in government and}} utilities are making distributed generation more viable. With more distributed generation, notably combined heat and power, comes {{an increase in the}} importance of standby rates, the cost of services utilities provide when customer generation is not operating or is insufficient to meet full load. This work looks at existing utility <b>standby</b> <b>tariffs</b> in five states. It uses these existing rates and terms to showcase practices that demonstrate a sound application of regulatory principles and ones that do not. The paper also addresses areas for improvement in standby rates...|$|R
40|$|A personal-computer based {{model of}} an Integrated Energy System for Industrial Estates (IESIE) has been {{developed}} as a pre-feasibility tool: it addresses the total energy concept by combining a set of CHP plant(s), boilers, vapor-compression and absorption chillers, national grid and utility transportation system. The core of the general model is the linear programming (LP) model which {{takes into account the}} changing demand-pattern of various loads and their <b>tariffs,</b> <b>standby</b> charge of electricity, unit fuel price, equipment costs, land cost, depreciation, O & M expenses, interest rate, taxes, etc. The output of the LP model yields the minimum total operating cost, optimal sizes of the equipment and their respective operational schedules. The hot utility and cold utility transportation model estimates the economic-minimum pipe size, considering installation cost, heat loss/gain cost and pumping cost. The heat balance model finds the thermal cycle equipment sizes as well as the variation of the heat-to-power ratio with load. Finally the economic model does the cash-flow analysis to determing whether the project will yield a required rate-of-return to be economically viable. Simulations have been done using the model considering a number of sample load patterns with the prevailing cost factors in India. An after tax IRR of 20 % was found for sites having load factors greater than 0 Â· 6, and up to 10 km utility transportation distance. ...|$|R
