40|$|Abstract. The drawing {{scheme of}} a <b>silencer</b> <b>cover</b> in the {{progressive}} die was studied. This cover was formerly processed by several single punching dies {{and now was}} produced by a progressive die. The drawing scheme was hard to determine. Therefore, the explicit dynamic software DYNAFORM was applied to make simulations about the drawing process. According to comparisons between the simulation and experiment results, the optimized drawing scheme, blank layout, blank size, binding force and some other process parameters were determined. The defects were eliminated after the proper drawbead was set. Experiments showed that numerical simulation provided an efficient way for the optimization of the forming scheme in the progressive die production...|$|E
