50|$|Most of the {{academic}} criticism of the rule is {{to the effect that}} it has been carried too far. Whilst it is generally accepted for a <b>subsequent</b> <b>assignee</b> for value to take priority over an earlier assignee by giving notice before he becomes aware of the earlier assignment, it seems harsh for the earlier assignee to lose priority where the notice is given by the <b>subsequent</b> <b>assignee</b> after he is aware of the earlier assignment. The net result is the priority depends upon the subsequent speed of response of the parties once one or both of them becomes aware of the problem.|$|E
5000|$|Ownership of {{intellectual}} property, including patents, copyrights, and trademarks, may be assigned, but special conditions {{attach to the}} assignment of patents and trademarks. In the United States, assignment of a patent is governed by statute, [...] Patent rights are assignable by an [...] "instrument in writing." [...] Title in a patent can also be transferred {{as a result of}} other financial transactions, such as a merger or a takeover, or as a result of operation of law, such as in an inheritance process, or in a bankruptcy. An assignment of a patent can be recorded with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Although such recording is not required, if an assignment is not recorded at the USPTO within three (3) months or prior to a subsequent assignment, the assignment will be void against a <b>subsequent</b> <b>assignee</b> without notice of the earlier, unrecorded assignment.|$|E
40|$|There are two {{purposes}} of this article. Firstly, it examines the consequences for stakeholders, if the mortgage originator or <b>subsequent</b> <b>assignee</b> of its rights, e. g. the trustee issuer, become insolvent and considers the main legal and financial risk issues that can arise in an RMBS program in Australia. Secondly, it focuses on a qualitative assessment {{of the extent to}} which the current regulatory provisions governing the insolvency of the originator and trustee issuer either impede or facilitate the operation and growth of the RMBS market in Australia. The existing regulation for insolvency of the originator and issuer and their financial security are assessed using a "public benefit test" framework. This framework is based on the principles of social cost-benefit analysis and is used to identify an optimal RMBS legal and regulatory regime that would provide a resolution to the conflicting interests of participants in the RMBS process.

50|$|One of {{the criticisms}} of Rome I {{is that it does}} not address the {{problems}} caused by successive assignments (by way of security or absolutely) and the determination of priorities between <b>subsequent</b> <b>assignees.</b> Further consultations were intended in relation to these issues, and those consultations have suggested alternative possibilities, but no definitive solution.|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{extends the}} {{literature}} investigating key drivers leading certain patents to exert a stronger {{influence on the}} subsequent technological developments (inventions) than other ones. We investigated six key determinants, as (i) the use of scientific knowledge, (ii) {{the breadth of the}} technological base, (iii) the existence of collaboration in patent development, (iv) the number of claims, (v) the scope, and (vi) the novelty, and how the effect of these determinants varies when patent influence - as measured by the number of forward citations the patent received - is distinguished as within and across the industrial and organizational boundaries. We conducted an empirical analysis on a sample of 5671 patents granted to 293 US biotechnology firms from 1976 to 2003. Results reveal that the contribution of the determinants to patent influence differs across the domains that are identified by the industrial and organizational boundaries. Findings, for example, show that the use of scientific knowledge negatively affects patent influence outside the biotechnology industry, while it positively contributes to make a patent more relevant for the <b>assignee's</b> <b>subsequent</b> technological developments. In addition, the broader the scope of a patent the higher the number of citations the patent receives from subsequent non-biotechnology patents. This relationship is inverted-U shaped when considering the influence of a patent on inventions granted to other organizations than the patent's assignee. Finally, the novelty of a patent is inverted-U related with the influence the patent exerts on the subsequent inventions granted across the industrial and organizational boundaries.
