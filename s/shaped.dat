40|$|Research into <b>shape</b> grammar {{implementation}} {{has been}} largely concerned with rectilinear <b>shapes</b> {{and there has been}} limited research into implementation on <b>shapes</b> composed of curves. This reflects developments of the <b>shape</b> grammar formalism which has been defined largely according to straight lines, planes, and associated volumes. In this paper, implementation of <b>shape</b> grammars on curved <b>shapes</b> is examined using algorithms for <b>shape</b> operations on <b>shapes</b> composed of para- metric curves. These algorithms have been implemented in a <b>shape</b> grammar interpreter for <b>shapes</b> composed of quadratic Bezier curves, which is illustrated via application of a <b>shape</b> grammar that generates Celtic knotwork patterns. Implementing <b>shape</b> grammars on <b>shapes</b> composed of Bezier curves highlights difficulties that arise when the <b>shape</b> grammar formalism is applied to curved <b>shapes,</b> and the paper concludes with a discussion that explores these difficulties and indicates potential implications for the <b>shape</b> grammar formalism. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We study <b>shapes</b> of planar arcs {{and closed}} {{contours}} modeled on elastic curves obtained by bending, stretching or compressing line segments non-uniformly along their extensions. <b>Shapes</b> are represented as {{elements of a}} quotient space of curves obtained by identifying those that differ by shape-preserving transformations. The elastic properties of the curves are encoded in Riemannian metrics on these spaces. Geodesics in <b>shape</b> spaces are used to quantify <b>shape</b> divergence and to develop morphing techniques. The <b>shape</b> spaces and metrics constructed are novel and offer an environment {{for the study of}} <b>shape</b> statistics. Elasticity leads to <b>shape</b> correspondences and deformations that are more natural and intuitive than those obtained in several existing models.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we take a}} {{predefined}} geometry <b>shape</b> as a constraint {{for accurate}} <b>shape</b> alignment. A <b>shape</b> model is divided in two parts: fixed <b>shape</b> and active <b>shape.</b> The fixed <b>shape</b> is a user-predefined simple <b>shape</b> {{with only a few}} landmarks which can be easily and accurately located by machine or human. The active one is composed of many landmarks with complex <b>shape</b> contour. When searching an active <b>shape,</b> pose parameter is calculated by the fixed <b>shape.</b> Bayesian inference is introduced to make the whole <b>shape</b> more robust to local noise generated by the active <b>shape,</b> which leads to a compensation factor and a smooth factor for a coarse-to-fine <b>shape</b> search. This method provides a simple and stable means for online and offline <b>shape</b> analysis. Experiments on cheek and face contour demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach...|$|R

40|$|This study evaluates {{methods used}} for granule <b>shape</b> characterization. The {{aim is to}} {{identify}} an optimal combination of <b>shape</b> factors to measure granule <b>shape</b> and roughness. Granules were prepared from microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), alpha-lactose, microfine cellulose (MFC), and dextrin, using a small-scale high-shear mixer. Granule <b>shapes</b> were analysed by measuring weight, by microscopic analysis, and by sedimentation analysis in olive oil. A comparison was made among (1) the aspect ratio, (2) the circularity, (3) a new projection <b>shape</b> factor defined in this paper, (4) the <b>shape</b> factor e(R), (5) the radial <b>shape</b> factor, (6) One-Plane-Critical-Stability (OPCS), (7) the Stokes' <b>shape</b> factor, and (8) a new mass <b>shape</b> factor defined in this paper. Besides {{the evaluation of the}} <b>shape</b> factors, (9) a roughness factor R is defined. When the <b>shape</b> of granules is evaluated, there can be effects of both <b>shape</b> and surface roughness. The scale of scrutiny of the measurement determines whether or not a <b>shape</b> factor is affected by surface roughness. We chose to call a protrusion smaller than 60 mum a roughness, and a larger protrusion a <b>shape</b> effect. The best evaluation of granule <b>shape</b> is obtained when <b>shape</b> and roughness are described by different parameters. The aspect ratio, the mass <b>shape</b> factor, OPCS, e(R) and the radial <b>shape</b> factor could not significantly discriminate between some of the different <b>shapes.</b> The other three <b>shape</b> factors give distinct differences in value for all different <b>shapes</b> used in this study. Of these factors, Stokes' <b>shape</b> factor was rejected because of the high viscosity of the oil needed, which results in a significant temperature dependency. Circularity and the new projection <b>shape</b> factor both work very well for our granules. The combination of the roughness factor with the new projection <b>shape</b> factor will provide a good description of granule <b>shape</b> and roughness.

40|$|Figure 1 : The {{notion of}} <b>shape</b> {{difference}} defined {{in this paper}} provides a way to compare deformations between <b>shape</b> pairs. This allows us to recognize similar expressions of <b>shape</b> A (top row) to those of <b>shape</b> B (bottom row), without correspondences between A and B and without any prior learning process. We develop a novel formulation for the notion of <b>shape</b> differences, aimed at providing detailed information about the location and na-ture of the differences or distortions between the two <b>shapes</b> being compared. Our difference operator, derived from a <b>shape</b> map, is much more informative than just a scalar global <b>shape</b> similarity score, rendering it useful {{in a variety of}} applications where more refined <b>shape</b> comparisons are necessary. The approach is intrin-sic and is based on a linear algebraic framework, allowing the use of many common linear algebra tools (e. g, SVD, PCA) for study-ing a matrix representation of the operator. Remarkably, the for-mulation allows us not only to localize <b>shape</b> differences on the <b>shapes</b> involved, but also to compare <b>shape</b> differences across pairs of <b>shapes,</b> and to analyze the variability in entire <b>shape</b> collections based on the differences between the <b>shapes.</b> Moreover, while we use a map or correspondence to define each <b>shape</b> difference, consistent correspondences between the <b>shapes</b> are not necessary for comparing <b>shape</b> differences, although they can be exploited if available. We give a number of applications of <b>shape</b> differences, including parameterizing the intrinsic variability in a <b>shape</b> collec-tion, exploring <b>shape</b> collections using local variability at different scales, performing <b>shape</b> analogies, and aligning <b>shape</b> collections...|$|R
