40|$|Strongyloidiasis is {{a disease}} caused by an {{infection}} with a soil-transmitted helminth that affects, according to largely varying estimates, between 30 million and 370 million people worldwide [1, 2]. <b>Not</b> <b>officially</b> <b>listed</b> as a neglected tropical disease (NTD), strongyloidiasis stands out as particularly overlooked [3].

The manifold signs and symptoms caused by Strongyloides stercoralis infection, coupled with the helminth’s unique potential to cause lifelong, persistent infection, make strongyloidiasis relevant beyond tropical and subtropical geographic regions, where, however, most of the disease burden is concentrated. Indeed, strongyloidiasis is acquired through contact with contaminated soil, and the infection is, thus, primarily transmitted in areas with poor sanitation, inadequate access to clean water, and lack of hygiene...|$|R
