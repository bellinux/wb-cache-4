25|$|The {{agent is}} emptied and {{depressurized}} and the valve is removed. After a thorough {{internal and external}} visual inspection, the cylinder is filled with water, placed inside a <b>safety</b> <b>cage,</b> and pressurized to the specified test pressure (varies with the type, age, and cylinder material) for the specified time period. If no failure, bulges, or leaks are detected, the cylinder passes. The cylinder is then emptied of water and thoroughly dried, and labeled with the test date and company that performed the test. CO2 types have the test information stamped on the cylinder, all other types get a sticker {{on the back of}} the cylinder. Once dry, the units are recharged. Unlike the UK, the US does not rebuild extinguishers and replace valves at specific intervals unless parts are found to be defective, with the exception of halon. Halon types are often given new o-rings and valve stems at every internal maintenance to minimize any leakage potential.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. For {{automotive}} {{manufacturers and}} tier- 1 suppliers, the upcoming safety standard ISO 26262 results in new {{requirements for the}} development of embedded electronics and software. In particular, the variety of driver assistance systems that autonomously influence the driving dynamics of a vehicle may have a high risk potential and require development in accordance with the normative guidelines. But especially for those systems whose function is typically not based solely on hardware but on complex software algorithms, safety certification can be very complex or even impossible. In this paper the problems of development of vehicle systems according to ISO 26262 are described. Finally an approach for a safety-oriented reference architecture is presented that introduces adaptive software <b>safety</b> <b>cages.</b> This architecture enables application of formal verification methods. Supported by multisensor data fusion this allows to reduce safety requirements for vehicle control systems. ...|$|R
5000|$|Technical {{problems}} {{plagued the}} early mining efforts, requiring {{the development of}} new mining technology to support the challenge. German engineer Philip Deidesheimer created a timbering system for mining tunnels called square sets, which enabled the retrieval of huge amounts of silver ore in a safe manner. Square set timbering, roots blowers, stamp mills, the Washoe Pan milling process, Cornish pumps, Burleigh machine drills, wire woven rope, miners’ <b>safety</b> <b>cages</b> and the <b>safety</b> clutch for those cages; even the Sutro tunnel all had a place in supporting the exploitation of the rich ore body. As technological advancements, these were used many times over in later mining applications. In 1876 one observer reported that in Virginia City, “every activity {{has to do with the}} mining, transportation, or reduction of silver ore, or the melting and assaying of silver bullion.” ...|$|R

25|$|Robots and {{artificial}} intelligences do not inherently contain or obey the Three Laws; their human creators must choose to program them in, and devise {{a means to}} do so. Robots already exist (for example, a Roomba) that are too simple to understand when they are causing pain or injury and know to stop. Many are constructed with physical safeguards such as bumpers, warning beepers, <b>safety</b> <b>cages,</b> or restricted-access zones to prevent accidents. Even the most complex robots currently produced are incapable of understanding and applying the Three Laws; significant advances in artificial intelligence {{would be needed to}} do so, and even if AI could reach human-level intelligence, the inherent ethical complexity as well as cultural/contextual dependency of the laws prevent them from being a good candidate to formulate robotics design constraints. However, as the complexity of robots has increased, so has interest in developing guidelines and safeguards for their operation.|$|R

40|$|Laying hen housing systems {{must provide}} feed, water, light, air quality, space and {{sanitation}} that promote {{good health and}} welfare for the hens. Housing systems should provide for expression of important natural behaviors, protect the hens from disease, injury and predation, and promote food <b>safety.</b> <b>Cages</b> for laying hens were developed in the United States during the 1920 s and 30 s to reduce disease, (e. g., coccidiosis and roundworms) and injuries due to pecking. In addition, the conventional cage simplified husbandry by increasing efficiency and required less real estate. In the late 1980 s and 1990 s, as international regulations began to restrict the use of conventional cages, greater use was made of free-range systems. However ongoing problems with disease and pecking in large flocks {{led to the development}} of an array of intermediate enriched cage, aviary and barn systems that aim to balance environmental enrichment with environmental containment and disease control. Currently, multiple housing methods and husbandry systems are in commercial use in the United States and around the world. Each system has advantages and disadvantages that vary depending on local conditions and management. Not all installations will exhibit all of the traits described as typical in the summaries below, especially as all housing types are undergoing active development and refinement.

40|$|The current {{trend in}} {{robotics}} shows that robots {{are more and}} more leaving their <b>safety</b> <b>cages</b> and are developed towards fulfilling complex tasks in a priori unknown and dynamic environments. Especially, the interaction with humans and coping with unpredictable situations are major challenges. An inspira-tion for solutions to this problem setting is commonly to see how humans handle comparable scenarios. They use both perception and cognition to generate a high-level understanding of the situation they are facing and adapt their behaviour accordingly. To enable robots to do so, it is essential to find appropriate formulations for variables describing the environmental context. Once these formulations are defined and classified, they can be included and considered conceptually in control theory. One example would be to consider the proximity of humans in the behaviour of a robot for safety reasons. A binary context variable can indicate whether a human is present or not, a vector can represent the minimum distance between robot and human and so forth. The task of this seminar is to first define context in the back ground of control theory, then to classify context variables and finally to give an overview on how the environmental context is already considered in state of the art control schemes.

The HELS Test Facility {{is designed to}} simulate the high current, intermediate current, continuing current, and restrike current components of an idealized direct strike lightning waveform. The HELS Test Facility has been in operation since May, 1988, and consists of four separate capacitor banks used to produce the lightning test components, two steel <b>safety</b> <b>cages</b> and steel barriers for retaining the item under test should it be ignited during testing, an earth covered bunker housing the control/equipment room, a charge/discharge building containing the charging/discharging switching, a remotely located blockhouse from which the test personnel control hazardous testing, and interconnecting cables. Since its construction, a variety of explosive items have been successfully tested. Besides testing, the HELS Test Facility has also been utilized to manufacture an experimental additive for solid propellant material. The restrike current component generator is ideal for exploding metallic wire in a gas filled vessel to create the additive residue. In addition to the HELS Test Facility, two other lightning simulator facilities are available for testing at Redstone Technical Test Center.
