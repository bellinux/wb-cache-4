The advertisements were sent out to sixty-five randomly selected student subjects, split into the three different groups.

25|$|Early in 1960, PARU's Pathfinder Company took {{up three}} posts along the Thai-Lao border. Each {{of the three}} {{stations}} was across the Mekong River from an important Lao town. The stations were sited near Vientiane, Mukdahan, and Pakxan. On 9 August came the Kong Le coup in Vientiane. Lair and the PARU would intrude into Laos {{in the wake of}} this coup, under complex circumstances. One was that Phoumi Nosavan, who was then the Lao head of state, was a first cousin to General Sarit. The prospect of his rival Phao losing influence as casualties sapped the PARU seems to have been another reason for Sarit's acquiescence. And even as Sarit supported intervention by the PARU, Lair briefed his CIA superiors. Lair's main <b>selling</b> <b>points</b> for leading his paramilitaries into Laos was the sheer secretiveness possible because his troopers could blend seamlessly into the Lao population. It was a demographic oddity that the majority of lowland Lao actually lived south of the Lao-Thai border. Most of Lair's PARU recruits were thus of Lao origin, though Thai citizens. It was also apparent to the agency's apparatus, which had been blindsided by the coup, that it lacked reliable military intelligence sources within Laos.|$|E

500|$|One {{of the key}} <b>selling</b> <b>points</b> of Bloodmoon was its {{reintegration}} of werewolves, {{a feature}} that had been included in Daggerfall, but was absent in Morrowind, despite being a feature prominently advertised in previews prior to the game's release. [...] Morrowind instead included vampirism, which was almost an [...] "Easter egg" [...] {{in terms of how}} many players remained unfamiliar with the feature. Players become werewolves by catching the lycanthropic disease [...] "Sanies Lupinus" [...] and letting three days pass without getting it cured. Once the disease has been fully integrated, the player transforms every night, regardless of the lunar cycle. Being a werewolf provides ability increases, though their strength was reduced relative to the major bonuses offered by lycanthropy in Daggerfall. Some reviewers found the addition a welcome challenge, but others thought it frustrating and poorly implemented.|$|E
500|$|In 1869, {{the state}} passed the [...] "Parks Law", which created the north, {{south and west}} parks district. [...] The parks districts were {{established}} as municipal corporations with funding based on the taxable real estate within its service area.

[...] Cornell was able to both benefit financially from the $46 million spent on the parks during {{the remainder of the}} century and to assume a position of influence over the parks. [...] Cornell served for over 13 years on the South Parks Commission, which regulated parks south of the city.

500|$|Hamasaki's {{lyrics and}} image have gained a {{following}} predominantly among the Generation X of Asia, {{mainly because of}} the [...] "conflicting or inharmonious beauty" [...] of her fashion and lyrics; Hamasaki's fashions combine Eastern and Western elements, and her songs, unlike those of many of her contemporaries, mostly all have English titles but contained no English lyrics (until Rainbow). Music critic Tetsu Misaki believed that the juxtaposition of her fashionable appearance and her personal lyrics was one of her most important <b>selling</b> <b>points.</b> The popularity of her music extends beyond Japan; she has a [...] "sizable [...] across Asia" [...] {{and is one of the}} few Japanese singers whose albums have sold over 10,000 copies in Singapore. In 2002, however, Hamasaki's domestic sales began declining due to a sluggish Japanese market and increasing piracy in Japan. As a result, she began moving toward the Asian market in 2002, performing at the 2002 MTV Asia awards in Singapore, at South Korea's [...] "Asia Song Festival", and at a concert in Beijing to celebrate Sino-Japanese relations. With her popularity declining (due in part to the rising popularity of other singers), she made a foray into the Asian market, starting with her first tour of Asia in 2007.|$|E
500|$|Katamari Damacy is a third-person puzzle-action {{video game}} that was {{published}} and developed by Namco for the PlayStation 2 in 2004. The music in the game was widely hailed as imaginative and original, and {{was considered one of}} its top <b>selling</b> <b>points.</b> Its eclectic composition featured elements of traditional electronic video game music, as well as heavy jazz and samba influences. The tracks were composed by multiple composers, with Yuu Miyake composing the most at seven and acting as the sound director; other composers for the game were Asuka Sakai, Akitaka Tohyama, Yoshihito Yano, Yuri Misumi, and Hideki Tobeta. Many of the tracks feature vocals from popular J-pop singers such as Yui Asaka and anime voice actors such as Nobue Matsubara and Ado Mizumori. Miyake has stated that they chose the artists by looking for [...] "Japanese singers who were well-known in Japan but nobody had heard from [...] for whatever reason". Miyake wanted to use vocal songs because he felt that they were necessary [...] "to make music that only Katamari Damacy could do, really fun music". He has said that game director Keita Takahashi did not give detailed directions on the sound design of the game, allowing Miyake and his team to instead create whatever they felt would fit best.|$|E
500|$|The {{graphics}} and flight mechanics {{were the most}} praised aspects of the game. Tom Guise from Computer and Video Games heralded the game's flight system and freedom as captivating, while stating that Nights into Dreams is the [...] "perfect evolution" [...] of a Sonic game. GamePro said flying using the analogue joystick [...] "is a breeze" [...] and that the gameplay is fun, enjoyable, and impressive. Entertainment Weekly said its [...] "graceful acrobatic stunts" [...] offer [...] "a more compelling sensation of soaring than most flight simulators". Edge praised the game's analogue controller and called the levels [...] "well-designed and graphically unrivalled", but the reviewer expressed disappointment in the limited level count compared to Super Mario 64, and suggested that Nights seemed to prioritise technical achievements and Saturn <b>selling</b> <b>points</b> over gameplay with as clear a focus as Sonic. Martin Robinson from Eurogamer opined that the flight mechanics were a [...] "giddy thrill", in contrast to Sonic games. Colin Ferris from Game Revolution praised the {{graphics and}} speed of the game as breathtaking and awe-inspiring, concluding that it offered the best qualities of the fifth-generation machines. GameFan praised the combination of [...] "lush graphics, amazing music, and totally unique gameplay". Next Generation criticised the fast tempo of the game, saying that the only disappointing aspect was the way [...] "it all rushes by so fast". However, the magazine praised the two-player mode and the innovative method of grading the player once they completed a level. Electronic Gaming Monthlys four reviewers were impressed with both the technical aspects and style of the graphics, and said the levels are great fun to explore, though they expressed disappointment that the game was not genuinely 3D and said it did not manage to surpass Super Mario 64.|$|E

500|$|Eurogamer Parkin {{wrote that}} the [...] "childlike" [...] and [...] "unusually Western" [...] {{graphics}} were similar to EarthBound in [...] "flat pastel textures devoid of shading" [...] as juxtaposed with background art that [...] "fizzes with life and character". He described the cutscenes' animations as [...] "bespoke", rare for 16-bit role-playing games, and of greater dramatic impact. RPGamer Jordan Jackson {{wrote that the}} visuals are typical of the series and fit the game's mood, and the website's Mike Moehnke criticized the inventory limits carried over from the previous game. Green of NGC said the game mechanics were [...] "depressingly basic" [...] against more advanced role-playing games. Eurogamer Parkin felt that the role-playing game elements were less interesting and added that Mother 3 had few standout <b>selling</b> <b>points</b> other than its attention to detail and [...] "only systemic innovation": the rhythm-based battle system. Kotaku Richard Eisenbeis praised the system, and GameSpot Greg Kasavin compared it {{with that of the}} Mario & Luigi series. Jackson wrote that the music was [...] "just as catchy as previous games" [...] despite being [...] "almost completely new". Moehnke agreed, calling it [...] "nothing less than stunning". He noted overtones of Wagner and Chuck Berry. Jackson said that the game was somewhat easier {{than the rest of the}} series and somewhat shorter, at about 30 hours in length. Both RPGamer reviewers noted that Mother 3 has few penalties for death. Jackson reflected that while the game is humorous and grows in enjoyment, it has some somber moments as well. Eisenbeis of Kotaku cited [...] "the importance of mothers" [...] as a key theme about which the game revolves, which he preferred to the mid-game [...] "slapstick insanity" [...] and final plot twist. Parkin wrote that the game was filled with [...] "memorable moments", including a character who criticizes the player [...] "for not giggling at puns", frogs with progressively silly costumes that save the game, a [...] "reconstructed mecha caribou" [...] battle, a bad haiku, and the [...] "campfire scene", and that while the game's simpleness could have lent towards [...] "raw stupidity", instead it was [...] "elegant in its simplicity".|$|E
