These concerns were supported by Penny Low, MP for Pasir Ris–Punggol GRC.|$|E

5|$|Skagen's {{first school}} was the Latinskole, a grammar school, {{which was in}} {{operation}} from 1549 until 1739. By {{the end of the}} 19th century, three <b>schools</b> <b>had</b> been established in Skagen: one in Vesterby, another in Østerby and a third in Højen. As a result of evolving legislation, a new public primary school (Borgerskolen) designed by A. Haunstrup was completed in 1901. A gymnasium was added in 1909 but in 1924 it was converted into classrooms to accommodate the growing number of pupils. A secondary school (Realskolen) was opened in 1904 behind the former local authority building on Sct. Laurentii vej. The secondary school was later moved next to the primary school and in 1948 the buildings were extended. An additional two-storey wing was completed in 1969.|$|E
5|$|Stuart Buck, a lawyer, also {{explored}} {{this issue}} in Acting White: The Ironic Legacy of Desegregation (2010). He said that segregated black <b>schools</b> <b>had</b> featured teachers, counselors, and others of the same race as the student population, and the adults often acted as mentors to the students. Integration of many public schools since the mid- to late-20th century may have resulted in schools in which black students perceived they were controlled or dominated by whites. A black student trying to achieve high educational success may then be considered as trying to leave the minority group.|$|E
