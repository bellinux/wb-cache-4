Overview RFC 1408 [1], the specification for the Telnet Environment Option, specifies definitions for VAR and VALUE that are reversed from the BSD implementation of the Telnet Environment option. Since the BSD implementation was the reference implementation that the RFC was supposed to document, and is the base for many existing implementations, there exists an interoperability problem between implementations with conflicting definitions for VAR and VALUE. This document describes a method for allowing implementors {{to ensure that their}} implementation of the Environment option will be interoperable with as many other implementations as possible, by providing a set of heuristics {{that can be used to}} help identify which definitions for VAR and VALUE are being used by the other side of the connection. 2. Client Telnet: Parsing a SEND The SEND <b>suboption</b> should only contain VAR and USERVAR commands. It should never contain a VALUE. If while parsing a SEND <b>suboption,</b> a VALUE is encountered, the client should assume that the server has reversed values for VAR and VALUE, and from that point on the client should reverse those values, both in parsing the rest of the SEND <b>suboption,</b> and when generating an IS or INFO <b>suboption.</b> If both VALUE and VAR commands are encountered, the SEND command is not well formed, and it is implementation dependent as to what will happen. If there are not VAR or VALUE commands in the SEND <b>suboption,</b> then the client cannot know what values the server is expecting for VAR and VALUE. In this case, it should just assume that the server has the correct definitions, and use the correct values for VAR an...|$|E

40|$|Advance-selling (AS) is a {{commonly}} observed industrial practice {{in which a}} retailer allows consumers to prebook the fashionable product before the real selling season starts. Motivated by this practice, this paper studies AS strategy for a retailer who sells a newsvendor-type of fashionable product in light of potential consumer opportunistic returns. In our model, the consumers face valuation uncertainty and know their valuation realization only after product acquisition. There also exists aggregate demand uncertainty, captured in the conventional newsvendor model. All preorders are fulfilled {{at the beginning of}} a normal-selling season. We build analytical optimization models and consider three strategic options for the retailer, namely, no advance-selling allowed (NAP), advance-selling with full refund (AFP) and advance-selling with partial refund (APP), where there are two <b>suboptions</b> under APP. We derive the retailer's optimal pricing and refund policies for each option. By comparing the results in the above options, important insights are generated. Finally, we conduct a numerical analysis to further examine the impacts brought by consumers valuation, market condition, and consumers classification on the optimal strategy.

40|$|The Department of Energy (DOE) is {{examining}} alternative {{strategies for the}} long-term management of depleted uranium hexafluoride (UF{sub 6 }) currently stored at the gaseous diffusion plants at Portsmouth, Ohio, and Paducah, Kentucky, and on the Oak Ridge Reservation in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. This paper describes the methodology for the comprehensive and ongoing technical analysis of the options being considered. An overview of these options, along with several of the <b>suboptions</b> being considered, is presented. The long-term management strategy alternatives fall into three broad categories: use, storage, or disposal. Conversion of the depleted UF 6 to another form such as oxide or metal is needed to implement most of these alternatives. Likewise, transportation of materials {{is an integral part}} of constructing the complete pathway between the current storage condition and ultimate disposition. The analysis of options includes development of pre-conceptual designs; estimates of effluents, wastes, and emissions; specification of resource requirements; and preliminary hazards assessments. The results of this analysis will assist DOE in selecting a strategy by providing the engineering information necessary to evaluate the environmental impacts and costs of implementing the management strategy alternatives...|$|R

40|$|A major {{modification}} of and addition to existing Closed Brayton Cycle (CBC) space power system optimization codes was completed. These modifications {{relate to the}} global minimum mass search driver programs containing three nested iteration loops comprising iterations on cycle temperature ratio, and three separate pressure ratio iteration loops [...] one loop for maximizing thermodynamic efficiency, one for minimizing radiator area, and a final loop for minimizing overall power system mass. Using the method of steepest ascent, the code sweeps through the pressure ratio space repeatedly, each time with smaller iteration step sizes, so that the three optimum pressure ratios can be obtained to any desired accuracy {{for each of the}} objective functions referred to above (i. e., maximum thermodynamic efficiency, minimum radiator area, and minimum system mass). Two separate options for the power system heat source are available: 1. A nuclear fission reactor can be used. It is provided with a radiation shield 1. (composed of a lithium hydride (LiH) neutron shield and tungsten (W) gamma shield). <b>Suboptions</b> can be used to select the type of reactor (i. e., fast spectrum liquid metal cooled or epithermal high-temperature gas reactor (HTGR)). 2. A solar heat source can be used. This option includes a parabolic concentrator and heat receiver for raising the temperature of the recirculating working fluid. A useful feature of the code modifications is that key cycle parameters are displayed, including the overall system specific mass in kilograms per kilowatt and the system specific power in watts per kilogram, as the results for each temperature ratio are computed. As the minimum mass temperature ratio is encountered, a message is printed out. Several levels of detailed information on cycle state points, subsystem mass results, and radiator temperature profiles are stored for this temperature ratio condition and can be displayed or printed by users...|$|R

40|$|This EA/RIR/IRFA {{analyzes}} {{the impacts of}} four alternatives to close specific areas of the Central Gulf of Alaska Regulatory Area (Central GOA) {{to the use of}} trawl gear and pot gear or as a <b>suboption,</b> in lieu of a closure to require additional observer coverage in these areas. Based on the Council’s recommendation, NMFS determined that increased observer coverage in specific areas of the Central GOA would interfere with the goals and objectives of the restructured observer program and is not necessary. The intent to improve Tanner crab bycatch information is addressed in the restructured observer program, which was implemented in 2013. The Council’s preferred alternative is to close a portion of Marmot Bay northeast of Kodiak Island to the use of trawl gear, except for the use of pelagic trawl gear to target pollock. The Council’s preferred alternative for the Marmot Bay Protection Area trawl closure will be combined with the Council's preferred alternative requiring modified nonpelagic trawl gear to be used when targeting flatfish in Central Gulf of Alaska Regulatory Area to form a suite of management measures for the protection and conservation of Tanner crab and reduce the potential for adverse impacts by nonpelagic gear on benthic habitat...|$|E
