5|$|Due to the {{fragmentary nature}} of known Paraceratherium fossils, the animal has been reconstructed in several {{different}} ways since its discovery. In 1923, W. D. Matthew supervised an artist to draw a reconstruction of the skeleton based on the even less complete P. transouralicum specimens known by then, using the proportions of a modern rhinoceros as a guide. The result was too <b>squat</b> and compact, and Osborn had a more slender version drawn later the same year. Some later life restorations have made the animal too slender, with little regard to the underlying skeleton. Gromova published a more complete skeletal reconstruction in 1959, based on the P. transouralicum skeleton from the Aral Formation, but this also lacked several neck vertebrae.|$|E
5|$|Seneb's {{dwarfism}} {{is depicted}} realistically in the sculpture. It portrays {{him with a}} large head but small arms and legs. This possibly indicates that he had achondroplasia, a common form of dwarfism that most severely affects the fastest-growing {{parts of the body}} – particularly the femur and humerus, which become short and <b>squat</b> – and stunts the forearms and lower legs. It also affects the head, producing a relatively large skull with a bulging forehead and often a depressed nasal bridge. An alternative diagnosis is dysmelia – a condition that produces short arms and legs. Seneb's wife Senites is portrayed far less realistically; her depiction is of a piece with other contemporary portraits of high-ranking Egyptian women.|$|E

5|$|The {{superfamily}} Rhinocerotoidea, {{which includes}} modern rhinoceroses, {{can be traced}} back to the early Eoceneabout 50 million years agowith early precursors such as Hyrachyus. Rhinocerotoidea contains three families; Amynodontidae, Rhinocerotidae ("true rhinoceroses"), and Hyracodontidae. The diversity within the rhinoceros group was much larger in prehistoric times; they ranged from dog-sized to the size of Paraceratherium. There were long-legged, cursorial forms adapted for running and <b>squat,</b> semi aquatic forms. Most species did not have horns. Rhinoceros fossils are identified as such mainly by characteristics of their teeth, which is the part of the animals most likely to be preserved. The upper molars of most rhinoceroses have a pi-shaped (π) pattern on the crown, and each lower molar has paired L-shapes. Various skull features are also used for identification of fossil rhinoceroses.|$|E
40|$|In this {{research}} a hybrid multibody-finite element model {{was developed and}} applied to the analyses of the initiation and growth of <b>squats,</b> and to {{the identification of the}} most influential parameters of <b>squatting.</b> The growth process of <b>squats</b> was postulated based on numerical simulation, and was subsequently validated by field monitoring. Further a critical size for small rail top geometrical defects to grow into <b>squats</b> has been derived and validated. This critical size may be directly applied to visual inspection and classification of <b>squats</b> so that false reporting of <b>squats</b> can be avoided. The critical size can be applied as a minimum action rule for preventive or early corrective maintenance actions, such as rail grinding. The model may also have the capability to relate the severity of some track short defects quantitatively to some measurement of the dynamic wheel-rail interaction at the defects so that automatic detection of the defects at their early stage is possible. Finally corrective and preventive measures against <b>squats</b> are discussed...|$|R

5|$|The prisoners' {{day began}} at 4:30 am (an hour later in winter) with morning roll call. Dr. Miklós Nyiszli {{describes}} roll call as beginning 03:00 and lasting four hours. The weather was cold in Auschwitz {{at that time}} of day, even in summer. The prisoners were ordered to line up outdoors in rows of five and had to stay there until 07:00, when the SS officers arrived. Meanwhile, the guards would force the prisoners to <b>squat</b> for an hour with their hands above their heads or levy punishments such as beatings or detention for infractions such as having a missing button or an improperly cleaned food bowl. The inmates were counted and re-counted. Nyiszli describes how even the dead had to be present at roll call, standing supported by their fellow inmates until the ordeal was over. When he was a prisoner in 1944–45, five to ten men were found dead in the barracks each night. The prisoners assigned to Mengele's staff slept in a separate barracks and were awoken at 07:00 for a roll call that only took a few minutes.|$|E
5|$|Emus {{begin to}} settle down at sunset and sleep during the night. They do not sleep {{continuously}} but rouse themselves {{several times during the}} night. When falling asleep, emus first <b>squat</b> on their tarsi and enter a drowsy state during which they are alert enough to react to stimuli and quickly return to a fully awakened state if disturbed. As they fall into deeper sleep, their neck droops closer to the body and the eyelids begin to close. If there are no disturbances, they fall into a deeper sleep after about twenty minutes. During this phase, the body is gradually lowered until it is touching the ground with the legs folded underneath. The beak is turned down so that the whole neck becomes S-shaped and folded onto itself. The feathers direct any rain downwards onto the ground. It has been suggested that the sleeping position is a type of camouflage, mimicking a small mound. Emus typically awake from deep sleep once every ninety minutes or so and stand upright to feed briefly or defecate. This period of wakefulness lasts for ten to twenty minutes, after which they return to slumber. Overall, an emu sleeps for around seven hours in each twenty-four-hour period. Young emus usually sleep with their neck flat and stretched forward along the ground surface.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Sexual {{receptivity}} {{of turkey}} hens {{as indicated by}} <b>squatting</b> (sexual crouch) was evaluated in three strains of breeder hens, Nicholas (N), Hybrid (H), and British United (B). The incidence of <b>squatting</b> was compared among strains through 84 d of photostimulation and related to egg production characteristics. Significant strain, time, and strain by time interaction effects occurred for the incidence of <b>squatting.</b> In all three strains, <b>squatting</b> started within the 1 st wk of photostimulation, rapidly peaked (75. 0, 65. 6, and 43. 0 % for H, B, and N hens, respectively) at 14 d of photostimulation, then returned to lower, basal levels at or before attainment of 50 % hen-day egg production. <b>Squatting</b> incidence was highly variable within and between strains but was generally lower in N hens than H and B hens, which showed similar <b>squatting</b> expression. The incidence of prelay <b>squatting</b> was not correlated to onset or rate of egg production. However, there was a negative correlation between squat-ting behavior and percentage floor eggs in H (P =. 03) hens. It was concluded that <b>squatting</b> incidence varies within and between strains of hens and {{is not related to}} subsequent egg laying performance...|$|R
