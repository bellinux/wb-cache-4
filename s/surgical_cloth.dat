40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effects of}} a "transitional object" (<b>surgical</b> <b>cloth)</b> on the thumb sucking of a 3 -year-old boy in two conditions: while sitting in the lap of his physical therapist and while alone in his crib. Sucking occurred when the cloth was present and did not occur when it was absent, regardless of condition. These results are discussed in terms of establishing operations, object attachment, and application...|$|E
40|$|A {{microbial}} evaluation {{was made}} of adhesive plastic <b>surgical</b> drapes and <b>cloth</b> <b>surgical</b> drapes. These studies were done both during surgery and in the laboratory. The plastic drape does not allow bacterial penetration, lateral migration does not occur, skin bacteria do not multiply under the drape within the time periods studied and the patient drapes are held in place with their use. When wet, cloth drapes showed profuse bacterial penetration. Dry cloth showed less bacterial penetration as compared to wet cloth. Lateral migration under cloth drapes {{was not possible to}} assess due to a high level of penetration. The surface of cloth showed a higher level of bacterial contamination during the surgical procedures. Deep wound cultures collected just prior to closing showed 60 % contamination when cloth was used compared to 6 % when plastic was employed. The micro-organisms recovered from the various sites sampled were identified. Finally, in addition to the positive aseptic benefits afforded by plastic adhesive drapes, aesthetic features such as a more delineated operative field and elimination of towel clips make this product a useful adjunct to the surgeon's armamentarium...|$|R
