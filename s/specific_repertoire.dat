40|$|The {{transformation}} of the historical functions and goals of the European university is producing the transition from mass university {{to what has been}} called “corporate university”. With this goal, I will examine how the new functions of the university are aimed at providing services and precarious workers to the labor structure of post-Fordism {{in the context of the}} growing importance of the “knowledge-based economy”. These changes have provoked a new wave of student protests. This new mobilization cycle has been based on the emergence of a new student subjectivity: the “precarious in training”. However, I claim that this wave of mobilization can be explained by the characteristics of the Fordist model that still applies to the European university. This model of university in extinction has facilitated a student response that can be characterized in terms of the classical Fordist patterns of collective action. At the same time, these patterns of action are being adapted to the emergence of the post-Fordist corporate-university through <b>specific</b> <b>repertoires</b> of action...|$|R
40|$|Mucosal-associated {{invariant}} T (MAIT) cells {{express a}} semi-invariant T cell receptor (TCR) that detects microbial metabolites {{presented by the}} nonpolymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) -like molecule MR 1. The highly conserved nature of MR 1 in conjunction with biased MAIT TCRα chain usage is widely thought to indicate limited ligand presentation and discrimination within a pattern-like recognition system. Here, we evaluated the TCR repertoire of MAIT cells responsive to three classes of microbes. Substantial diversity and heterogeneity were apparent across the functional MAIT cell repertoire as a whole, especially for TCRβ chain sequences. Moreover, different pathogen-specific responses were characterized by distinct TCR usage, both between and within individuals, suggesting that MAIT cell adaptation was {{a direct consequence of}} exposure to various exogenous MR 1 -restricted epitopes. In line with this interpretation, MAIT cell clones with distinct TCRs responded differentially to a riboflavin metabolite. These results suggest that MAIT cells can discriminate between pathogen-derived ligands in a clonotype-dependent manner, providing a basis for adaptive memory via recruitment of <b>specific</b> <b>repertoires</b> shaped by microbial exposure...|$|R

40|$|Although {{the most}} {{researched}} extreme right actors {{take the form}} of political parties, social movements research has recently started analysing extreme right organizations that go beyond ordinary politics and that {{take the form of}} 'groupuscular’ organizations. However, most existing contributions rely on secondary data and focus mainly on public networks and online activism of extreme right actors and their strategies of action. Very few ethnographic studies of extreme right social movements exist with the result that we still need a deeper understanding of their off-line mobilization, ideological discourse and militancy and how these in turn interact with the choice of <b>specific</b> <b>repertoires</b> of action. In this framework, the aim {{of this paper is to}} present the findings of a research project that explored dynamics of militant participation and forms of activism promoted by a neo-fascist organization: CasaPound Italia.

40|$|Phenotypic changes {{effected}} by pathophysiological events are now routinely captured by gene expression pro-file (GEP) measurements, determining mRNA abundance on a genome-wide scale in a cellular population[8, 9]. In contrast, methods to measure protein abundance on a proteome-wide scale using arrays[11] or mass spectrometry[10] technologies {{are far less}} developed, covering {{only a fraction of}} proteins, requiring large amounts of tissue, and failing to directly capture protein activity. Furthermore, mRNA expression does not constitute a reliable predictor of protein activity, as it fails to capture a variety of post-transcriptional and post-translational events that are involved in its modulation. Even reliable measurements of protein abundance, for instance by low-throughput antibody based methods or by higher-throughput methods such as mass spectrometry, do not necessarily provide quantitative assessment of functional activity. For instance, enzymatic activity of signal transduction proteins, such as kinases, ubiquitin ligases, and acetyltransferases, is frequently modulated by post-translational modification events that do not affect total protein abundance. Similarly, transcription factors may require post-translationally mediated activation, nuclear translocation, and co-factor availability before they may regulate <b>specific</b> <b>repertoires</b> of their transcriptional targets. Fi-nally, most target-specific drugs affect the activity of their protein substrates rather than their protein or mRNA transcript abundance...|$|R

40|$|Extra {{cellular}} response kinase 7 (Erk 7) is a mitogen-activated protein kinase. Studying behavioral plasticity in honeybees led to {{my initial}} interest in Erk 7. A previous gene expression profiling study implicated Erk 7 {{as a candidate}} gene in honeybee behavioral plasticity. My work has built upon and extended these initial findings. Honey bee workers exhibit a hierarchical organization of behavioral plasticity in which longduration, age-related and socially modulated states are characterized by <b>specific</b> <b>repertoires</b> of short-duration behaviors. Young workers (hive bees) perform tasks at the hive center including brood-care (nursing) and leave the hive for short training (orientation) flights. Older workers (foragers) collect water, nectar and pollen to provision the hive. Erk 7 protein regulation is associated both with long-duration behavioral state, and with specific, short-duration behavior. Erk 7 protein occurs in the bee brain in phosphorylated form and has an additional modification that is susceptible to N-glycanase. I have demonstrated that Erk 7 is expressed throughout the honeybee brain. Light and vision are important components of honeybee behavioral plasticity.

40|$|Exosomes are {{released}} by most cells to the extracellular environment and {{are involved in}} cell-to-cell communication. Exosomes contain <b>specific</b> <b>repertoires</b> of mRNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs) and other non-coding RNAs that can be functionally transferred to recipient cells. However, the mechanisms that control the specific loading of RNA species into exosomes remain unknown. Here we describe sequence motifs present in miRNAs that control their localization into exosomes. The protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A 2 B 1 (hnRNPA 2 B 1) specifically binds exosomal miRNAs through the recognition of these motifs and controls their loading into exosomes. Moreover, hnRNPA 2 B 1 in exosomes is sumoylated, and sumoylation controls the binding of hnRNPA 2 B 1 to miRNAs. The loading of miRNAs into exosomes can be modulated by mutagenesis of the identified motifs or changes in hnRNPA 2 B 1 expression levels. These findings identify hnRNPA 2 B 1 as {{a key player in}} miRNA sorting into exosomes and provide potential tools for the packaging of selected regulatory RNAs into exosomes and their use in biomedical applicationsThis work was supported by grants SAF 2011 - 25834, ERC- 2011 -AdG, BIO 2009 _ 07990, BIO 2010 - 17527, COST-Action BM 1202, P 210 /BMD- 2305 and Cardiovascular Network RD 12 - 0042 - 0056 from Instituto Salud Carlos III.

40|$|Rare {{cases of}} stable {{allograft}} acceptance after discontinuation of immunosuppression are {{often accompanied by}} macrochimerism (> 1 % donor cells in blood) or microchimerism (< 1 % donor cells in blood). Here, we have investigated whether persistence of donor cells is the cause or the consequence of long-lasting CTL unresponsiveness. We found that engraftment of splenocytes bearing a single foreign MHC class I–restricted epitope resulted in lifelong donor cell microchimerism and specific CTL unresponsiveness. This status was reversed in a strictly time- and thymus-dependent fashion when the engrafted cells were experimentally removed.

40|$|Abstract- With the {{increasing}} demand for high quality, more efficient design of logic circuits, the problem of circuit design has become a multi-objective optimization problem.

Usually, logic circuits are designed by human beings who have a <b>specific</b> <b>repertoire</b> of conventional design techniques. These techniques limit the solutions that may be considered during the design process in both form and quality. The application of evolutionary algorithms has allowed the creation of circuits which are substantially superior to the best known human designs. Several evolutionary algorithms are applied in design of combinational circuits, namely Genetic Algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimization and Ant colony Optimization techniques. We compared these approaches and produces better performance {{both in terms of}} quality of solution and in terms of speed of convergence...|$|E

40|$|Mitochondrial {{dysfunction}} {{has long}} been associated with Parkin-son’s disease (PD). Parkin and PINK 1, two genes associated with familial PD, have been implicated in the degradation of depolarized mitochondria via autophagy (mitophagy). Here, we describe the involvement of parkin and PINK 1 in a vesicular pathway regulating mitochondrial quality control. This pathway is distinct from canonical mitophagy and is triggered by the generation of oxidative stress from within mitochondria. Wild-type but not PD-linked mutant parkin supports the biogenesis of a population of mitochondria-derived vesicles (MDVs), which bud off mitochondria and contain a <b>specific</b> <b>repertoire</b> of cargo proteins. These MDVs require PINK 1 expression and ultimately target to lysosomes for degradation.
