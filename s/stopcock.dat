25|$|The side-float design uses a {{float on}} the end of a lever to control the fill valve. The float is usually shaped like a ball, so the {{mechanism}} is called a ball-valve or a ballcock. Cock is a term for valve; see, for example, <b>stopcock.</b> The float was originally made from copper sheet, but it is now usually plastic. The float is located to one side of the main valve tower at the end of a rod or arm. As the side-float rises, so does the side-float-arm. The arm connects to the fill valve that blocks the water flow into the toilet tank, and thus maintains a constant level in the tank.|$|E
2500|$|When using {{glassware}} it {{is often}} necessary to control the flow of fluid. [...] It is commonly stopped with a stopper. Fluid may be transported between connected pieces of glassware. [...] Types of interconnecting components include glass tubing, [...] T-connectors, Y-connectors, and glass adapters. [...] For a leak-tight connection a ground glass joints is used (possibly reinforced using a clamping method such as a Keck clips). [...] Another way to connect glassware is with a hose barb and flexible tubing. Fluid flow can be switched selectively using a valve, of which a <b>stopcock</b> is a common type fused to the glassware. Valves made entirely of glass {{may be used to}} restrict fluid flows. Fluid, or any material which flows, can be directed into a narrow opening using a funnel.|$|E

[...] Testing is normally with a portable meter, which measures the methane content as its percentage volume in air. [...] The corresponding oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations are also measured. [...] A more accurate method used to monitor over the longer term, consists of gas monitoring standpipes should be installed in boreholes. [...] These typically comprise slotted uPVC pipework surrounded by single sized gravel. [...] The top 0.5m to 1.0m of pipework is usually not slotted and is surrounded by bentonite pellets to seal the borehole. [...] Valves are fitted and the installations protected by lockable <b>stopcock</b> covers normally fitted flush with the ground. [...] Monitoring is again with a portable meter and is usually done on a fortnightly or monthly basis.|$|E

50|$|Different grades exist (e.g. thick or viscous, soft). The viscous one is {{used for}} {{standard}} <b>stopcocks</b> and ground joins. The soft grade is for large <b>stopcocks</b> and ground joints, desiccators, and for lower temperature use.

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: to {{evaluate}} the use of peripheral venous catheters based on microbiological analysis of devices (dressing and three-way <b>stopcocks)</b> and thus contribute to the prevention and infection control. Methods: this was a prospective study of microbiological analysis of 30 three-way <b>stopcocks</b> (external surfaces and lumens) and 30 dressing used in maintaining the peripheral venous catheters of hospitalized adult patients. Results: all external surfaces, 40 % of lumens, and 86. 7 % of dressing presented bacterial growth. The main species isolated in the lumen were 50 % coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, 14. 3 % Staphylococcus aureus, and 14. 3 % Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Fifty nine percent of multidrug-resistant bacteria were isolated of the three-way <b>stopcocks,</b> 42 % of the lumens, and 44 % of the dressing with a predominance of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus resistant to methicillin. Besides, 18 % gram-negative bacteria with resistance to carbapenems were identified from multidrug-resistant bacteria on the external surfaces of the three-way <b>stopcocks.</b> Conclusion: it is important to emphasize the isolation of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and gram-negative bacteria resistant to methicillin and carbapenems in samples of devices, respectively, which reinforces the importance of nursing care in the maintenance of the biologically safe environment as well as prevention and infection control practices...|$|R

5000|$|Stopcocks used in {{laboratory}} glassware are typically forms of conically tapered plug valves. When fused with the glassware, the valve bodies {{are made of}} glass. Otherwise, they can be made of an inert plastic such as Teflon. The plugs can be made of a similar plastic or glass. When the plug is made of glass, the handle and plug are fused together in one piece out of glass. When glass is used for both the <b>stopcock</b> body and the plug, the contacting surfaces between them are special ground glass surfaces (see Laboratory glassware) often with <b>stopcock</b> grease in between. Special glass stopcocks are made for vacuum applications, such as in use with vacuum manifolds. <b>Stopcock</b> grease is always used in high vacuum applications to make the <b>stopcock</b> air-tight. Also if the plug valve is [...] "locked" [...] from being in the open or closed position for an extended amount of time lubricant can be added through the greaser with the valve in service.|$|E

50|$|<b>Stopcocks</b> are {{generally}} available individually with some length of glass tubing at the ports {{so that they}} can be joined by a glass blower into custom apparatus at the point of use. This is especially common for the large glass manifolds used in high vacuum lines. Many additional variations exist in both plug boring and joint assembly.|$|R
40|$|Official reports relate that, in the US, one patient/month dies as {{a result}} of the {{emergency}} oxygenator change-out procedure, and the permanent injury of some patients is the result of current oxygenator change-out procedures or oxygenator failures, both in extracorporeal circulation (ECC) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The aim of this article is to evaluate a new system and procedure, dedicated to oxygenator change-out, represented by two three-way <b>stopcocks</b> inserted in the ECC line in use. A dedicated back-up oxygenator and circuit can be easily primed and connected to the dedicated connector on the <b>stopcocks,</b> then blood flow is diverted to the new oxygenator without interruption of the ECC. Tests performed showed that oxygenator change-out can be completed by perfusionists in 62. 13 +/- 11. 12 sec. Results obtained show that the new system and procedure allows fast, safe and reproducible oxygenator change-out without interruption of the ECC...|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} kinds of funnels that have been adapted for specialized applications in the laboratory.

50|$|Stopcocks {{are often}} parts of {{laboratory}} glassware such as burettes, separatory funnels, Schlenk flasks, and columns used for column chromatography. The <b>stopcock</b> is a smooth tampered plug or rotor with a handle, which fits into a corresponding ground glass female joint. The stationary female joint is designed {{such that it}} joins two or more pieces of glass tubing. The <b>stopcock</b> has holes bored through it which allow the tubes attached to the female joint to be connected or separated with partial turns of the <b>stopcock.</b> Most stopcocks are solid pieces with linear bores although some are hollow with holes to simple holes that can line up the joints tubing. The <b>stopcock</b> is held together with the female joint with a metal spring, plastic plug retainer, a washer and nut system, {{or in some cases}} vacuum. Stopcocks plugs are generally made out of ground glass or an inert plastic like PTFE. The ground glass stopcocks are greased to create an airtight seal and prevent the glass from fusing. The plastic stopcocks are at most lightly oiled.|$|E

50|$|Filtration under inert {{conditions}} poses {{a special}} challenge {{that is usually}} tackled with specialized glassware. A Schlenk filter consists of sintered glass funnel fitted with joints and <b>stopcocks.</b> By fitting the pre-dried funnel and receiving flask to the reaction flask against a flow of nitrogen, carefully inverting the set-up, and turning on the vacuum appropriately, the filtration may be accomplished with minimal exposure to air.|$|R
5000|$|Connection {{to the new}} supply {{required}} {{approval from}} the Earl of Egremont; despite this, there were {{a large number of}} unauthorised connections although the system was not intended to be used for drinking, being untreated river water. In 1839, it was recorded that the pipes from Coultershaw supplied 7 public and 146 private <b>stopcocks</b> in Petworth, including the brewery, malt house, a windmill and the Swan Inn.|$|R
50|$|In the past, {{scientists}} constructed {{their own}} laboratory apparatus {{prior to the}} ubiquity of interchangeable ground glass joints. Today, commercially available parts connected by ground glass joints are preferred; where specialized glassware are required, they are made to measure using commercially available glass tubes by specialist glassblowers. For example, a Schlenk line is made of two large glass tubes, connected by <b>stopcocks</b> and smaller glass tubes, which are further connected to plastic hoses.|$|R
