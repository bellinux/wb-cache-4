40|$|In {{many cases}} {{it is useful}} and {{appropriate}} to assess potential erosion risk both in the undisturbed environment and in catchments heavily disturbed by humans. One method for assessing risk, when modelling environmental processes, is to quantify the error(s) associated with model input parameters and include this in the modelling process. This study examines the impact of digital elevation model (DEM) error on the estimation of soil loss and geomorphological changes in a Northern Territory, Australia catchment. Multiple realizations (or versions) of the same catchment were created by including positional error in the DEM. The SIBERIA erosion model was run for a simulated 1000 -year period, using these multiple catchment realizations as this is the expected minimum design life for rehabilitated uranium mines in the area. Examination of the area-slope relationship, hypsometric curve, and cumulative area distribution after 1000 years of simulated erosion demonstrates little geomorphological difference.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{agricultural}} practices on wood turtle (Glyptemys insculpta) movements and survivorship {{was investigated in}} a fragmented agri-forest landscape over two years. Agricultural activities and machinery contributed {{to the death of}} 20 % of radio-tracked turtles. Annual survivorship of adults was 0. 904 and 0. 868 and for juveniles it was 0. 815 and 0. 831 for 1998 and 1999, respectively. Mutilation rates in adults were 90 % +/- 3 % in both years; in contrast, the maximum rate in juveniles was 57 %. Setting the cutting height of disc mowers to 100 mm would increase harvest yields, reduce wear on machinery, decrease soil erosion, and reduce turtle mortality and mutilation rates. The concepts of integral, <b>statistical,</b> and linear <b>range</b> are introduced as distinct estimators of turtle movements. Since integral ranges include all habitats critical to survival, they provide an important contribution to our knowledge of imperiled species. <b>Statistical</b> <b>ranges</b> are stable and easily promote within and between study comparisons. Linear ranges quantify migratory and ranging movements. Thread-trailing techniques were used to record the fine-scale movements of six adult male G. insculpta translocated to an experimental hayfield patch-matrix. Although patch size had no effect on move length or path sinuosity, habitat structure did. Paths were generally straighter and move length longer in the harvested portion of a hayfield. Apparent habitat boundaries were shown to be permeable. Subjects exhibit three movement phases: agitation dispersal, local search, and ranging. Thus, G. insculpta exhibit predetermined movement patterns and move to maximize the likelihood of locating resources, while minimizing the probability of revisiting previously searched areas. Recent changes in agricultural practices and machinery are having a decidedly negative impact on G. insculpta. This study provides new insights into the movements of G. insculpta.

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{acoustic}} monitoring, {{the location of a}} sound source can be passively estimated by exploiting time-of-arrival and time-difference-of-arrival measurements. To evaluate the fundamental hardness of a location estimator, the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) has been used by many researchers. The CRB is computed by inverting the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), which measures the amount of information carried by given distance measurements. The measurements are commonly expressed as actual distances plus white noise. However, the measurements do include extra noise types caused by time synchronization, acoustic sensing latency, and signal-tonoise ratio. Such noise can significantly affect the performance and depend highly on the sensing platforms such as Android smartphones. In this paper, we first remodel the acousticbased distance measurements considering such additive errors. Then, we derive a new FIM with the new <b>statistical</b> <b>ranging</b> error models. As a result, we obtain new CRBs for both noncooperative and cooperative localization schemes that provide better insight into the causality of the uncertainties. Theoretical analysis also proves that the proposed CRBs for localization become the old CRBs when the additional errors are ignored, which gives a robust check for the new CRBs. Thus, the new CRBs can serve as a benchmark for localization estimators with both new and old measurement models. The new CRBs also indicate that there is room to improve current localization schemes; however, it is a daunting challenge...|$|R
