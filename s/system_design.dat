If the main sound system is stereo, the subwoofers can also be in stereo. Otherwise, a mono subwoofer channel can be derived within the crossover from a stereo mix, depending on the crossover make and model.|$|E

40|$|Social <b>systems</b> <b>design</b> is {{employed}} {{to plan a}} better society. This paper discusses some theoretical issues of practical social <b>systems</b> <b>design</b> {{from the perspective of}} classical structural-functional theory. Social <b>systems</b> <b>design</b> refers to three aspects: design of function, design of structure, and the design of change process. One should not concentrate on the design of structure, for example, but instead on all three simultaneously. The four types of strategy for social <b>systems</b> <b>design</b> are isomorphism, transplantation, adaptation, and innovation. How to design differs according to these strategies. Most social <b>systems</b> <b>designs</b> encounter some dilemma that is resolved not a priori but by the careful consideration of information based on actual situations. More research on integration for resolving social <b>systems</b> <b>design</b> dilemmas is required. よりよい社会を設計するという意味での社会システムデザインについて、古典的な構造＝機能主義の枠組みを出発点にして、実際にデザインを行うために必要な理論上の問題を検討する。 社会システムデザインにおいてデザインされる対象は「機能」「構造」「変動過程」の 3 つであり、「構造」だけでなく、 3 つの対象間の関連を考慮してデザインを進めるべきである。また、社会システムデザインの戦略には「同型化」「移植」「適応」「革新」の 4 つがあり、戦略ごとにデザインの方法が異なる。そして社会システムデザインにおいてさまざまなジレンマが発生するが、そのジレンマの解決は、先験的には不可能であり「現場」の情報の個別的な組み込みによってなされる。社会システムデザインにおけるジレンマの解消過程、合意形成過程についてさらに議論を深めることが残された課題である...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} process of operations <b>systems</b> <b>design</b> {{within the context of}} the manufacturing organization. Using the DRAMA (Design Routine for Adopting Modular Assembly) model as developed by a team from the IDOM Research Unit at Aston University as a starting point, the research employed empirically based fieldwork and a survey to investigate {{the process of}} production <b>systems</b> <b>design</b> and implementation within four UK manufacturing industries: electronics assembly, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering and carpet manufacturing. The intention was to validate the basic DRAMA model as a framework for research enquiry within the electronics industry, where the initial IDOM work was conducted, and then to test its generic applicability, further developing the model where appropriate, within the other industries selected. The thesis contains a review of production <b>systems</b> <b>design</b> theory and practice prior to presenting thirteen industrial case studies of production <b>systems</b> <b>design</b> from the four industry sectors. The results and analysis of the postal survey into production <b>systems</b> <b>design</b> are then presented. The strategic decisions of manufacturing and their relationship to production <b>systems</b> <b>design,</b> and the detailed process of production <b>systems</b> <b>design</b> and operation are then discussed. These analyses are used to develop the generic model of production <b>systems</b> <b>design</b> entitled DRAMA II (Decision Rules for Analysing Manufacturing Activities). The model contains three main constituent parts: the basic DRAMA model, the extended DRAMA II model showing the imperatives and relationships within the design process, and a benchmark generic approach for the design and analysis of each component in the design process. DRAMA II is primarily intended for use by researchers as an analytical framework of enquiry, but is also seen as having application for manufacturing practitioners...|$|R
40|$|Across fields, more {{sustainable}} and resilient outcomes are being realized {{through a whole}} <b>systems</b> <b>design</b> perspective, which guides decision-makers to consider the entire system affected including interdependent physical and social networks. Although infrastructure is extremely interdependent, consisting of diverse stakeholders and networks, the infrastructure design and construction process is often fragmented. This fragmentation can result in unnecessary tradeoffs, leading to poor outcomes for certain stakeholders and the surrounding environment. A whole <b>systems</b> <b>design</b> perspective would help connect this fragmented industry and lead to {{more sustainable}} outcomes. For example, a whole <b>systems</b> <b>design</b> approach to relieve traffic on a highway might see beyond the obvious, but often ineffective, response of adding a new vehicle lane to encourage a solution such as repurposing existing road lanes from automobiles to above-ground “subway” systems. This paper discusses influences to whole <b>systems</b> <b>design</b> and how intentional choice architecture, meaning the way decisions are posed, can nudge decision-makers to employ whole <b>systems</b> <b>design</b> and result in more sustainable infrastructure. By uncovering these influences and organizing them by the social, organizational, and individual levels of the infrastructure design process, this paper provides the needed foundation for interdisciplinary research to help harness these influences through choice architecture and whole <b>systems</b> <b>design</b> for the infrastructure industry...|$|R
