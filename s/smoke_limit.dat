Furthermore, underwater exhaust systems are employed on board ships to save space, and reduce noise and pollution on working decks. However, water at exhaust outlet creates a flow resistance for the exhaust gases, which {{adds to the}} back pressure. High back pressure reduces the operating limits of an engine, increases fuel consumption, {{and can lead to}} exhaust smoke. While the effects of back pressure were recognized earlier, {{there is a lack of}} experimentally validated research on the performance limits of a turbocharged, marine diesel engine against high back pressure for the entire operating window. The focus of this research is to provide a comprehensive understanding of back pressure effects on marine diesel engine performance, and to identify limits of acceptable back pressure along with methods to tackle high back pressure. In this work, a pulse turbocharged, medium speed, diesel engine was tested at different loads and engine speeds; against different values of static back pressure. Additionally, mean value model simulations could be validated and were used to compare the performance of a pulse and constant pressure turbocharged engine against high back pressures of 1  meter water-column (mWC), and for two different values of valve overlap. Using the validated simulation model, the conceptual basis for the engine <b>smoke</b> <b>limit</b> as well as for thermal overloading is investigated. A methodology applying the conceptual basis to define boundaries of acceptable back pressures has been presented in this paper.

40|$|Problems of {{combustion}} instability {{and the need}} for wider range in firing rates have drawn attention to the need for more fundamental knowledge of the performance and the characteristics of pressure-jet atomized oil flames. A secondary problem is the complication and inconvenience of measurements on full scale equipment. In the present study various operational conditions for a typical modern burner with a pressure-jet atomizer and a swirled air supply were investigated. The variables chosen were fuel rate and spray angle. Data obtained consisted of gas composition, velocity and temperature measurements. The development of a laboratory unit was considered desirable to provide a means of facilitating measurements on flames of this type and a rig was constructed which consisted of a suitable combustion box and 3 / 10 ths scale burner. It was shown that the matching of the spray angle to the air register aerodynamics affected the flame characteristics very markedly, Regions of high unburnt fuel occurred due to fuel penetration and poor mixing outside and downstream of {{the main part of the}} flame. The effect of widening the spray angle which usually occurs with wide range types of pressure-jet atomizers at the lower fuel rates was shown to be particularly unsatisfactory, and to effect the black <b>smoke</b> <b>limit.</b> The general course of mixing and the progress of combustion through the flame was deduced from calculation from the gas composition results. The distribution and effects of recirculation were shown from the velocity measurements. These were related to data for simple jets. In particular, it was deduced that internal recirculation in the core was largely responsible for flame stabilization. Theoretically derived scaling criteria were investigated by comparing full scale and model results. These showed that reasonable comparisons were possible between the two, with flames scaled either on the basis of similarity in velocity and relative momentum between spray and air, or on similarity in residence times in the flame. The former was thought probably to be better, Cold flow measurements were made, and showed differences in the size of the central recirculation core between hot and cold but not in the peak velocity to peak velocity diameter early in the flame. Combustion oscillation measurements on a marine boiler produced data which suggested strongly that these were of the "non-acoustic" type. None of the theories so far suggested appear to - ii - account with much accuracy for the observed data. In the course of experimental work various special Instruments for flow measurement were developed. It was concluded that the choice of spray distribution to suit a particular aerodynamic pattern was vital to the optimum performance of the burner. In all the cases investigated this was found to be to some extent imperfect. It is considered that decided improvements could be made to the air distribution in burners of this type. The following possibilities are suggested solutions, the use of a higher degree of swirl and a confining quarl, upstream air injection or the use of multiple oil nozzles and by avoiding devices where the spray angle varies widely over the operating range...|$|E

To deter smoking from occurring they verbally interacted with their children on the topic and took action by having a no-smoking rule. There were three interaction approaches, which differed by style and method of interaction. Most parents interacted by discussing smoking with their children. They intentionally took advantage of opportunities. Some interacted by telling their children about the health effects of smoking and their opposition to it. They responded on the spur-of-the-moment if their attention was drawn to the issue by external cues. A few interacted by acknowledging to their children the negative effects of smoking.

The latter evolve through consumption career {{described by the}} stages of change. Those effects are tested on a sample of French smokers who completed an online-survey. A first model tests the role of addiction on the motivation to quit.

Moreover, as cigarette consumption becomes more anchored in everyday life and more solitary, reported motivation to quit increases. The second model, studies the relationship between smoking related perceptions and motivation to quit. Results show that smoking denormalization beliefs increase, and self-exempting beliefs decrease across the smoking career.

Understanding mechanisms underlying these defects would improve preventive strategies. Methods We used human alveolar macrophages obtained from healthy Malawian adults exposed naturally to household air pollution, and compared with human monocyte-derived macrophages exposed in vitro to respirable-sized particulates. Cellular inflammatory response was assessed by: IL- 6 and IL- 8 production in response to particulate challenge; phagocytosis of fluorescent-labelled beads and intraphagosomal oxidative burst capacity; ingestion and killing of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis measured by microscopy and quantitative culture. Particulate ingestion was quantified by digital image analysis. Results We were able to reproduce the carbon loading of naturally exposed alveolar macrophages by in vitro exposure of monocyte derived macrophages. Fine carbon black induced IL- 8 release from monocyte derived and alveolar macrophages (p< 0. 05), with similar magnitude responses (log 10 increases of 0. 93 [SEM 0. 2] vs 0. 74 [SEM 0. 19] respectively). Phagocytosis of pneumococci and mycobacteria was impaired with higher particulate loading. High particulate loading corresponded with a lower oxidative burst capacity (p= 0. 0015). There was no overall effect on killing of M. tuberculosis. Conclusion Alveolar macrophage function is altered by particulate loading.

This article examines trends in smoke-free workplace policies in North Carolina. We also examine whether workers comply with such policies. Methods: Data from the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey were analyzed from 1992 through 2002. Trends for North Carolina workers are compared with workers nationally, and trends are presented by age, race, gender, {{and type of}} worker. Results: North Carolina ranks 35 th {{in the proportion of}} its workforce reporting a smoke-free place of employment. The proportion of workers reporting such a policy doubled between 1992 and 2002. Females {{were more likely to report}} a smoke-free work environment (72. 0 %, CI +/- 2. 6) than males (61. 2 %, CI +/- 4. 6 %). Blue-collar (55. 6 %, CI +/- 5. 5) and service workers (61. 2 %, CI +/- 8. 4), especially males, were less likely to report a smoke-free worksite than white-collar workers (73. 4 %, CI +/- 2. 6). Compliance with a smoke-free policy does not appear to be an issue, only 3. 2 % of workers statewide reported someone had violated their company’s nonsmoking policy.

The objective {{of this study was to}} find an empirical model of diesel engine transfer function for control purpose. With an assumption of linear diesel operation in a limited region, the linear theory was adopted. Since a smoke problem generally appears during unsteady operation, fuel metering rate was selected as an input variable. Binary input signals (pseudo-random binary sequence and multi-frequency binary sequence) were selected as input signals. Step input signal was also used for transient study of smoke production. The system identification method using binary signals was tested by computer simulation before applying it to the engine experiment;An engine control and monitoring package was developed using an 8088 based personal computer. This package included a host computer, a multipurpose interface board for signal processing, a fuel metering valve perturbing mechanism with a modified fuel metering pump, an in-line smoke opacity meter, and an operating software written in C and Assembly languages. Temperatures at various engine locations and air/fuel flow were also measured. The spectral analysis was implemented to find the frequency response of system for the pseudo-random binary signal. The multi-frequency binary input and the output signals were Fourier transformed. The resulting frequency domain signals were plotted on Bode plot and postulated transfer functions were fitted using the Box nonlinear optimization procedure;The higher order of transfer function between smoke opacity and fuel metering rate was obtained for 9 operating points. These models can be utilized in development of an electronic injection pump for the reducing smoke level and increasing fuel economy.

Additionally, the fire ignition patterns used during a prescribed fire operation depend on topography, available resources (trained personnel, engines, etc.), surrounding vegetation, and relationship to the wildland-urban interface. While fire behavior is complex, strong relationships have been found between certain metrics of fire intensity and fire severity, and fire severity and habitat structure in shrublands and forests (Keeley 2009). In these systems, surface temperatures and duration of heating (fire intensity metrics) are positively correlated with surface duff consumption, a measure of fire severity (Hartford and Frandsen 1992). Also, the degree of biomass loss, either aboveground or belowground, influences the post-burn vegetation community recovery trajectory in forests (Turner et al. 1999, Schoennagel et al. 2004, Perry et al. 2011, Ryan et al. 2013).

40|$|In this paper, a deep domain {{adaptation}} based {{method for}} video smoke detection is proposed to extract a powerful feature representation of smoke. Due to the <b>smoke</b> image samples <b>limited</b> in scale and diversity for deep CNN training, we systematically produced adequate synthetic smoke images {{with a wide}} variation in the smoke shape, background and lighting conditions. Considering that the appearance gap (dataset bias) between synthetic and real smoke images degrades significantly {{the performance of the}} trained model on the test set composed fully of real images, we build deep architectures based on domain adaptation to confuse the distributions of features extracted from synthetic and real smoke images. This approach expands the domain-invariant feature space for smoke image samples. With their approximate feature distribution off non-smoke images, the recognition rate of the trained model is improved significantly compared to the model trained directly on mixed dataset of synthetic and real images. Experimentally, several deep architectures with different design choices are applied to the smoke detector. The ultimate framework can get a satisfactory result on the test set. We believe that our approach is a start in the direction of utilizing deep neural networks enhanced with synthetic smoke images for video smoke detection.
