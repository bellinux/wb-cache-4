25|$|Derby County, {{promoted}} to the First Division in 1969 after a lengthy absence, emerged as a force during the 1970s, winning the league title in 1972 under the controversial but effective management of Brian Clough, and again in 1975 under Clough's successor Dave Mackay. Clough, after a disastrous 44-day spell as Don Revie's successor at Leeds United, enjoyed even greater success at Nottingham Forest, taking the East Midlands club to promotion in 1977, the league title and League Cup in 1978 and to a further League Cup and the European Cup in 1979, before retaining their European crown in 1980. During this run of outstanding success, Clough also <b>shelled</b> <b>out</b> British football's first £1million transfer fee for the Birmingham City forward Trevor Francis, who signed for Forest in February 1979. Also among his acquisitions was the goalkeeper Peter Shilton, {{who went on to}} win a record of 125 full caps for England.|$|E
25|$|A German attack {{threatened}} the left {{flank of the}} 1st Cavalry Division (Major-General Beauvoir De Lisle), which held its position on Messines Ridge despite substantial casualties. The 3rd Cavalry Brigade of the 2nd Cavalry Division was <b>shelled</b> <b>out</b> of its positions at Kortewilde and the line was withdrawn to Hollebeke Château. Confusion over the orders, meant the units interpreted the order from Gough to retreat to this new line as an order for a general retreat beyond Hollebeke Château. Once this was realised, Gough ordered an immediate counter-thrust to recapture lost ground. The attack succeeded with little loss, against the German Cavalry Corps. Lieutenant-General Gustav von Hollen, given command of the Cavalry Corps after his performance commanding German IV Cavalry Corps on 20 October, was dismissed and replaced by General Georg von der Marwitz. The 6th Cavalry Brigade and the 7th Division moved to cover the gap that {{threatened the}} left flank.|$|E

2500|$|In XIII Corps, the 35th Division was {{to attack}} at [...] on 20 July, to take {{trenches}} between Maltz Horn Farm and Arrow Head Copse, preliminary {{to the general}} attack on Guillemont and {{on the rest of}} the German second position, after a thirty-minute bombardment to cover a French attack on the right, which was then cancelled. Two companies of the 105th Brigade, attacked against massed machine-gun and artillery-fire and were <b>shelled</b> <b>out</b> of the few parts of the German front line they reached; an attack at [...] by a battalion of the 104th Brigade also failed. The Fourth Army artillery began to register targets (firing ranging shots) on 21 July but poor visibility, made aircraft observation impossible at times. Co-ordination of the combined attack, proved impossible for the three armies and the 35th Division and 3rd Division attacked Guillemont early on 22 July and were repulsed.

2500|$|Ruppelt {{concluded}} that Adamski was a talented con artist whose UFO stories {{were designed to}} make money from his gullible followers and listeners, and he compared Adamski to the famed hoaxer, carnival, and circus showman PT Barnum. In describing Adamski's speaking style, Ruppelt wrote [...] "to {{look at the man}} and listen to his story you had an immediate urge to believe him...he was dressed in well-worn, but neat, overalls. He had slightly graying hair and the most honest pair of eyes I've ever seen. He spoke softly and naively, almost pathetically, giving the impression that 'most people think I'm crazy, but honestly, I'm really not.'" [...] According to Ruppelt, Adamski had a persuasive effect on his audience, [...] "you could actually have heard the proverbial pin drop" [...] in the restaurant as Adamski told of his initial 1952 meeting with Orthon. When Adamski finished his story, Ruppelt noted that many of his listeners purchased copies of Adamski's UFO photos that were on sale in the restaurant. At another lecture led by Adamski and other well-known contactees, Ruppelt wrote that [...] "people <b>shelled</b> <b>out</b> hard cash to hear Adamski's story." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 9 July, the 24th and 68th Brigades of the 23rd Division {{spent the}} morning {{attempting}} to improve their positions south and west of Contalmaison, ready for a bigger attack by the 69th Brigade on 10 July. Indications of a German counter-attack from the village were followed by bombardment of the 68th Brigade front, which caused many casualties, since the trenches were shallow and crowded with men. A German attack was then rapidly dispersed by small arms and artillery fire. A battalion of the 24th Brigade established a machine-gun nest in a commanding position south of the village and patrols of a 68th Brigade battalion entered Bailiff Wood, before being <b>shelled</b> <b>out</b> by British artillery. An attempt to return at [...] was forestalled by a German counter-attack by parts of II Battalion and III Battalion, IR 183 of the 183rd Division at [...] which was intended to reinforce the line between Contalmaison and Pozières but was repulsed with many casualties.

2500|$|On 9 July, two brigades of the 23rd Division {{spent the}} morning attacking south and west of Contalmaison. A {{battalion}} of the 24th Brigade established a machine-gun nest in a commanding position south of the village {{and part of the}} 68th Brigade entered Bailiff Wood, before being <b>shelled</b> <b>out</b> by British artillery. An attempt to return later that day, was forestalled by a German counter-attack by parts of II Battalion and III Battalion, Infantry Regiment 183 of the 183rd Division at [...] which was to reinforce the line between Contalmaison and Pozières but was repulsed with many casualties. The British attack began at [...] on 10 July, managed to occupy Bailiff Wood and trenches either side and at [...] after a careful reconnaissance, two battalions assembled along Horseshoe Trench, in a line [...] long facing Contalmaison, [...] away to the east. Two companies were sent towards Bailiff Wood, to attack {{the north end of the}} village. After a thirty-minute bombardment, a creeping barrage moved in five short lifts through the village, to the eastern fringe as every machine-gun in the division, fired on the edges of the village and the approaches. The attack moved forward in four waves, with mopping-up parties following, through much return fire from the garrison and reached a trench at the edge of the village, forcing the survivors to retreat into Contalmaison. The waves broke up into groups, which advanced faster than the barrage and the divisional artillery commander speeded up the creeping barrage and the village was captured, despite determined opposition from parts of the garrison.|$|E

Then he locked the granary, and put the key away, and afterwards went to the barn, and opened the great doors, which led in to the barn floor. He climbed up a tall ladder to a loft under the roof of the barn, and threw down some sheaves of wheat,--as many as he thought would be necessary to produce the quantity of grain which the farmer had ordered. He then descended the ladder, and got a flail, and began to thresh them out.|$|E

The first village was found deserted. At another, {{a quarter of a mile}} behind, the enemy made a stand; but were <b>shelled</b> <b>out,</b> and the plain beyond the Matun river was soon covered with fugitives. Major Stewart--with forty men of the 5th Punjaub Cavalry, who accompanied the column--charged 400 of them, and cut down many; until checked by the heavy fire of matchlock men from the high bank.|$|E

60|$|Their {{houses were}} earthen-walled and straw-thatched. Under the floors ran flues {{through which the}} kitchen smoke escaped, warming the sleeping- room in its passage. Here we lay and rested for days, {{soothing}} ourselves with their mild and tasteless tobacco, which we smoked in tiny bowls {{at the end of}} yard-long pipes. Also, there was a warm, sourish, milky-looking drink, heady only when taken in enormous doses. After guzzling I swear gallons of it, I got singing drunk, which is the way of sea-cunies the world over. Encouraged by my success, the others persisted, and soon we were all a-roaring, little reeking of the fresh snow gale piping up outside, and little worrying that we were cast away in an uncharted, God-forgotten land. Old Johannes Maartens laughed and trumpeted and slapped his thighs with the best of us. Hendrik Hamel, a cold-blooded, chilly-poised dark brunette of a Dutchman with beady black eyes, was as rarely devilish as the rest of us, and <b>shelled</b> <b>out</b> silver like any drunken sailor for the purchase of more of the milky brew. Our carrying-on was a scandal; but the women fetched the drink while all the village that could crowd in jammed the room to witness our antics.|$|E
60|$|The {{departure}} of the French had been hastened by the rapidly-increasing discontent and insubordination among the troops. During the later days of the siege Sir Sidney Smith had issued great numbers of printed copies of {{a letter from the}} Sultan authorizing him to offer a safe passage to France to the French army if it would surrender. This offer was a tempting one indeed to the soldiers. They had suffered hardships of all kinds since they had disembarked at Alexandria. They had been parched with thirst, half-choked with blinding dust, and had seen their comrades fall in numbers smitten by sunstroke. They counted but little the losses they had suffered in the battles in Egypt--that was in the ordinary way of the business of a soldier; but the dread of assassination whenever they ventured out from their lines, whether in camp or on the march, had weighed heavily upon them. Then had come the plague that had more than decimated them at Jaffa, and now they were reduced to well-nigh half their strength by {{the manner in which they}} had been sent time after time against the breach in the wall of an insignificant town, which would have been of no use to them if taken, as they could have been <b>shelled</b> <b>out</b> of it by the British men-of-war and gun-boats.|$|E
60|$|Those who {{expected}} that General Clements would get his own back had not long to wait. In {{a few days}} {{he was in the}} field again. The remains of his former force had, however, been sent into Pretoria to refit, and nothing remained of it save the 8th R.F.A. and the indomitable cow-gun still pocked with the bullets of Nooitgedacht. He had also F battery R.H.A., the Inniskillings, the Border regiment, and a force of mounted infantry under Alderson. More important than all, however, was the co-operation of General French, who came out from Pretoria to assist in the operations. On the 19th, only six days after his defeat, Clements found himself on the very same spot fighting some at least of the very same men. This time, however, there was no element of surprise, and the British were able to approach the task with deliberation and method. The result was that both upon the 19th and 20th the Boers were <b>shelled</b> <b>out</b> of successive positions with considerable loss, and driven altogether away from that part of the Magaliesberg. Shortly afterwards General Clements was recalled to Pretoria, to take over the command of the 7th Division, General Tucker having been appointed to the military command of Bloemfontein in the place of the gallant Hunter, who, to the regret of the whole army, was invalided home. General Cunningham henceforward commanded the column which Clements had led back to the Magaliesberg.|$|E
