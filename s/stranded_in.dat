5|$|An {{exchange}} of Japanese and Allied diplomatic personnel <b>stranded</b> <b>in</b> the opposing nations occurred in August 1942, which allowed Tatsuo Kawai, the Japanese ambassador to Australia, {{to return home}} with {{the ashes of the}} four Japanese submariners.

5|$|In 1897, 1,800 {{travellers}} attempted {{this route}} {{but the vast}} majority were caught along the river when the region iced over in October. Only 43 successfully reached the Klondike before winter and of those 35 had to return, having thrown away their equipment en route to reach their destination in time. The remainder mostly found themselves <b>stranded</b> <b>in</b> isolated camps and settlements along the ice-covered river often in desperate circumstances.|$|E
5|$|In July 2007, torrential rain flooded {{some of the}} {{traditional}} village centre and primary school. The storm coincided with the annual Glade music festival and jeopardised the event. The festival gates were temporarily closed while organisers assessed the flooding, which submerged one of the stages. The festival's car park was incapacitated, with thousands of revellers <b>stranded</b> <b>in</b> the village and surrounding lanes.|$|E

5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} the Starfleet and Maquis crew of the {{starship}} USS Voyager after they were <b>stranded</b> <b>in</b> the Delta Quadrant far {{from the rest of}} the Federation. In this episode, Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan) is abducted, along with Tuvok (Tim Russ), while on a survey mission and forced by her captors to fight in an arena for the entertainment of others.|$|E
5|$|At an eco {{hotel in}} the desert, Greene tells Medrano that now he {{controls}} the majority of Bolivia's water supply, Medrano must accept a new contract that makes Greene Planet Bolivia's sole water utility company at significantly higher rates. Bond infiltrates the complex, kills {{the chief of police}} (Fernando Guillén Cuervo) for betraying Mathis, and single-handedly assaults the hotel. After killing the security detail, he confronts Greene. Meanwhile, Camille kills Medrano, avenging the murders of her family. The struggle leaves the hotel destroyed by fire. Bond captures Greene and interrogates him about Quantum, leaving him <b>stranded</b> <b>in</b> the desert with only a can of engine oil, wondering if Greene will get thirsty enough to drink it.|$|E

40|$|The tight {{junction}} (TJ) strand is a linear proteinaceous polymer spanning plasma membranes, and each TJ strand associates laterally with another TJ <b>strand</b> <b>in</b> the apposing membranes of adjacent cells to form “paired” TJ strands. Claudins {{have been identified}} as the major constituents of TJ strands, and when exogenously expressed in L fibroblasts, they polymerize into paired strands, which are morphologically similar to paired TJ <b>strands</b> <b>in</b> epithelia. Here, we show that a fusion protein of GFP with claudin- 1 can also form similar paired <b>strands</b> <b>in</b> L fibroblasts, allowing us to directly observe individual paired claudin <b>strands</b> <b>in</b> live cells in real time. These paired strands showed more dynamic behavior than expected; they were occasionally broken and annealed, and dynamically associated with each other in both an end-to-side and side-to-side manner. Through this behavior of individual paired claudin strands, the network of strands was reorganized dynamically. Furthermore, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analyses revealed that claudin molecules were not mobile within paired strands. Although these observations are not necessarily representative of TJ <b>strands</b> per se <b>in</b> epithelial cells, they provide important information on the structural and kinetic properties of TJ <b>strands</b> <b>in</b> situ with significant implications for barrier function of TJs...|$|R
5|$|Bond uncovers a plot between Greene and an exiled Bolivian General, Medrano, to put Medrano {{in power}} in Bolivia while Quantum are given a {{monopoly}} to run the water supply to the country. Bond ascertains Quantum are damming Bolivia's supply of fresh water to force the price up. Bond attacks the hotel where Greene and Medrano are finalising their plans and leaves Greene <b>stranded</b> <b>in</b> the desert with only a tin of engine oil to drink. Bond then finds Vesper Lynd's former lover and member of Quantum, Yusef Kabira.|$|E
5|$|Cochrane was {{transferred}} to the North America and West Indies station in November 1917, but rejoined the 2nd Cruiser Squadron early in 1918. She was based in Murmansk between March and September 1918 during the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. She ferried Soviet troops to Pechenga on 3 May to forestall an attempt by White Finns to seize the town. On 14 November 1918 she was <b>stranded</b> <b>in</b> the Mersey Estuary, while {{under the control of the}} pilot, and later broke in two, becoming a total loss. The wreck had been broken up in situ by June 1919.|$|E
5|$|During their patrol, Wish Bear spots Christy <b>stranded</b> <b>in</b> a canoe {{within a}} lake; the other Bears and Cousins {{set out to}} rescue her. Dark Heart fires {{lightning}} bolts before the team, and captures many of them with his magic bag the favor he wanted Christy to do all along. The few Family members at hand determine that she {{has teamed up with}} him. This prompts Tenderheart Bear to hold a conference at the Hall of Hearts; Friend Bear, Secret Bear and Christy's friends later join them.|$|E

5|$|Following a {{distress}} signal, the TARDIS lands {{aboard a}} 17th-century pirate ship <b>stranded</b> <b>in</b> {{the middle of}} an ocean. The ship's crew have been terrorised by a Siren-like creature (Lily Cole) who marks people with black spots on their palms after they are injured. Her song then lulls victims into a trance, making them want to go to her, which apparently disintegrates them. Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) receives a cut during a tussle with the pirates, and finds a black spot on his hand, but is prevented from succumbing to the song of the Siren by Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and the Doctor (Matt Smith).|$|E
5|$|Following {{his defeat}} in Sonic Colors, Doctor Eggman is left <b>stranded</b> <b>in</b> outer space with his robot henchmen Orbot and Cubot. A mysterious time-traveling entity {{known as the}} Time Eater appears; Eggman, realizing its potential, uses it {{to go back in}} time and team up with his past ("Classic") self. The two convert it to a robot to erase their past defeats from history. The Time Eater {{proceeds}} to attack Classic Sonic as he travels through Green Hill {{at the beginning of the}} original Sonic the Hedgehog, and interrupts a birthday celebration being held for the present ("Modern") Sonic by his friends, scattering them. Modern Sonic awakens in White Space and rescues Tails after traveling through Green Hill.|$|E
5|$|Gale-force winds {{covered the}} far {{northern}} Atlantic between Western Europe and Atlantic Canada, {{due to the}} intensity of this storm, with hurricane-force winds confined near its center of circulation. After reaching its peak intensity, the system weakened as it moved into the far northeast Atlantic, dissipating by 17 January. This storm caused blizzards across much of Scotland {{and led to the}} final breakup of the oil tanker MV Braer, which had been <b>stranded</b> <b>in</b> rocks off the Shetland Islands by a previous storm nearly a week beforehand.|$|E

5|$|Homer, {{envious of}} Ned Flanders's new motor home, goes to Bob's RV Round-up {{to buy one}} of his own, but because of his poor credit rating, he is only {{qualified}} for a smaller dilapidated one, much to his family's disgust. Thrilled with the new RV, Homer takes his family on an excursion. Driving on remote back roads and ignoring Marge's suggestion to turn back on the main road, the Simpsons find themselves teetering over a precipice. The family escapes the RV before it plummets over the cliff, leaving themselves <b>stranded</b> <b>in</b> the wilderness.|$|E
5|$|In 1381 the Peasants' Revolt {{broke out}} in England, during which Gaunt was {{targeted}} by the rebels as an especially hated member of the administration. He found himself <b>stranded</b> <b>in</b> the north of England {{in the early part}} of the revolt but considered Dunstanburgh insufficiently secure to function as a safe haven, and was forced to turn to Alnwick Castle instead, which refused to let him in, fearing that his presence would invite a rebel attack.|$|E

It is reported that in that town, 10trees fell causing little or no damage. Also, the Rio Grande flooded its banks to 3.3meters (10ft) above flood stage. It is reported that 300families {{were not able to}} return to their homes for several weeks as a result of the flooding.|$|E
