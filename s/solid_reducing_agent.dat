40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to contribute to the investigation of the physicochemical behaviour of laterite ores during their roasting reduction, in order to optimize the energy requirements of their metallurgical treatment. Roasting reduction constitutes a critical step of the pyrometallurgical treatment of nickeliferous laterites for ferronickel production. The energy requirements for this step are almost 65 % of the total energy required to produce a ferronickel alloy of 12 - 14 % in Ni, {{while at the same time}} this total energy corresponds to a very significant portion of the treatment cost. Therefore, the optimization of roasting reduction contributes significantly to the economics of the metallurgical process through improving its energy efficiency and reducing the frequency of the operational problems in the following step of smelting reduction. Within the framework of the current study, the reducibility of nickeliferous lateritic ores of domestic and foreign origin with a different mineralogical composition as well as the reducibility of the hematite mineral was investigated, giving special emphasis to the study of the rate controlling mechanisms in the various steps of reduction. The reducibility study included reduction experiments with gaseous (CO-N 2) and solid (lignite and coke) reducing agents. The main part of the study was based on the experimental work including standard ASTM reduction tests with a gaseous reducing mixture (CO-N 2), similar with the ASTM tests designed for the determination of the reducibility of iron ores. It comes from the experimental results that reducibility of the Greek nickeliferous laterite ore of intermediate type (ore of Kastoria origin) is significantly higher than that of the rest of the laterite ores examined under the same conditions. That is, reduction degree of Kastoria ore after 90 minutes in the temperatures 650 to 9000 C, was ranging from 62 to 95 %, whereas that of limonitic type of ores from Evia island and Lokrida, as well as an intermediate type of ore from Indonesia, was 26 - 49 %, respectively. This result was verified for the ores in the form of grains (of 6 to 12 mm size), as well as various ore mixtures in the form of pellets. It was also deduced from this study that ore grain size and composition of the gaseous reducing mixture critically affect the results of reduction. Temperature favors the progress of reduction only within the range 650 - 7500 C, whereas its effect is almost negligible within the range 750 - 9000 C. Nevertheless, the effect of temperature is also critical within the range 750 - 9000 C during reduction of laterite ores with a <b>solid</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>agent</b> (lignite). In such a case, it is considered that a temperature increase leads to the higher activation of the solid fuel, i. e. a more intensive reducing atmosphere due to the increased evolution of CO resulting from the gasification of fuel and the decomposition of hydrocarbons contained in its volatile constituents, resulting in an increased rate of reduction. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{is based on}} the topochemical modification of three set of phases: Sr 3 Co 2 O 5 Cl 2, SrO(Sr(Ru 0. 5 M 0. 5) O 3) n (M = Ti, Mn, Fe; n = 1, 2, ∞), and SrO(SrVO 3) n (n = 1, 2, ∞). The topochemical reduction of Sr 3 Co 2 O 5 Cl 2 using sodium hydride as a <b>solid</b> state <b>reducing</b> <b>agent</b> results in the formation of a reduced phase containing cobalt centres with an average oxidation state of + 2 and an overall composition of Sr 3 Co 2 O 4 Cl 2. The resulting material adopts a structure containing double sheets of square-planar corner-sharing CoO 2 units separated by rock salt SrCl layers. Variable-temperature diffraction measurements reveal that these sheets undergo a cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion at T ~ 200 K due to unevenly filled degenerate (d xy, d yz) orbitals. This material adopts a magnetic structure in which the moments within each sheet are ordered antiferromagnetically, but the sheets are aligned ferromagnetically. An investigation was carried on the reduction behaviour of Ru-doped Sr(Ru x Fe 1 - x) O 3. It was found that the reduction was non-topochemical for values of x > 0. 5. For values of 0 < x < 0. 5, no single phase precursor material could be formed. For the material with x = 0. 5, reduction with CaH 2 produced a new phase with composition Sr(Ru 0. 5 Fe 0. 5) O 2. This material is the first reported instance of Ru 2 + in an extended transition metal oxide. DFT calculations reveal that, while the iron centres adopt a high-spin configuration, the ruthenium centres are in an intermediate-spin S = 1 configuration. Resulting competing magnetic interactions lead to frustration and lack of ordering. In order to further study the reduction behaviour of extended transition metal oxides containing ruthenium, the reduction of Sr 2 (Ru 0. 5 Fe 0. 5) O 4 and Sr 3 (Ru 0. 5 Fe 0. 5) 2 O 7 was performed using CaH 2 as a <b>solid</b> state <b>reducing</b> <b>agent.</b> In these cases, reduction leads to segregation of the materials into multiple phases adopting closely related structures that differ mainly in their oxygen content. In these materials, the ruthenium centres are preferentially reduced, such that starting from materials containing Ru 5 + and Fe 3 +, materials containing Ru (3 -δ) + and Fe 3 + are produced. Similarly, the low-temperature oxidation using CuF 2 as a solid state fluoride source was performed on materials with composition Sr 3 (Ru 0. 5 M 0. 5) 2 O 7 (M = Ti, Mn, Fe). In the case of M = Mn and Ti, materials with composition Sr 3 (Ru 0. 5 Fe 0. 5) 2 O 7 F 2 are produced in which the ruthenium centres are oxidised to Ru 6 +. For the M = Fe material, oxidation results in partial exchange of O for F and a material with composition Sr 3 (Ru 0. 5 Fe 0. 5) 2 O 5. 5 F 3. 5 in which the ruthenium centres are oxidised from + 5 to + 5. 5 while the iron centres remain in a + 3 oxidation state. While fluorination of the M = Ti leads to increasing itinerant electronic behaviour, fluorination of the M = Mn and Fe materials induces a twisting of the MX 6 octahedra that enables magnetic order to emerge at low temperatures. Finally, reaction of the SrO(SrVO 3) n (n = 1, 2, ∞) series of phases with CaH 2 results in the formation of phases with composition SrO(SrVO 2 H) n (n = 1, 2, ∞), the first examples of stoichiometric oxyhydride materials. SrVO 2 H is magnetically ordered at room temperature, while the n = 1 and n = 2 materials order at 170 K and 240 K respectively. The high magnetic ordering temperature arises from strong interactions between (d xy, d yz) orbitals in a manner analogous to the reduced iron-containing phases SrO(SrFeO 2) n.

The combustion {{and fluid}} {{flow in the}} FPC CO boiler is examined with emphasis {{on the influence of}} the injection position of <b>reducing</b> <b>agent</b> on NOx reduction.
