5|$|A bicycle kick, {{also known}} as an {{overhead}} kick or <b>scissors</b> <b>kick,</b> is a physical move in association football. It is achieved by throwing the body backward up into the air, making a shearing movement with the lower limbs to get one leg {{in front of the}} other in order to strike an airborne ball rearwards above head level, without resting on the ground. In most languages, the manoeuvre is named after either the cycling motion or the scissor motion that it resembles. Its complexity, and uncommon performance in competitive football matches, makes it one of association football's most celebrated skills.|$|E
25|$|In {{the opening}} match, Booker T faced Mark Henry. Henry {{controlled}} {{most of the}} match, as {{he was able to}} execute a spinebuster and apply various submission holds on Booker. Booker executed a <b>scissors</b> <b>kick</b> to win.|$|E
25|$|The fourth {{match was}} for the WWE United States Championship between Booker T and Chris Benoit. Before the match began, Booker {{announced}} that he would forfeit the United States title. As Benoit confronted Sharmell, Booker attacked Benoit. Benoit controlled the match in the beginning as he performed a series of suplexes. After Booker told the referee that his groin was re-injured, the referee backed Benoit away but Booker pushed him into the steel steps. Benoit performed a series of German suplexes and paid tribute to Eddie Guerrero by performing the Three Amigos. Booker attempted a Houston Hangover but missed. Benoit executed a series of German suplexes until Sharmell jumped on the apron. Benoit attempted a diving headbutt but Sharmell's distraction allowed Booker to counter. Booker executed a <b>Scissors</b> <b>Kick</b> for a near-fall. Sharmell distracted Benoit again and Booker pinned him with a roll up but Benoit countered into a Sharpshooter attempt, which Booker countered. Benoit avoided a <b>Scissors</b> <b>Kick</b> and applied the Sharpshooter but Booker fought the move. Benoit forced Booker to submit to the Crippler Crossface to win the title.|$|E

25|$|The fifth {{match was}} for the World Heavyweight Championship between Batista and the {{champion}} King Booker. During the match, Booker set Batista up for the <b>scissors</b> <b>kick,</b> but as he performed the move, Batista countered it into a suplex powerslam. Batista tried a Batista Bomb, but Queen Sharmell interfered by kicking Batista {{as he tried to}} lift Booker. As a result, Booker was disqualified, so Batista won the match but not the title because a title cannot change hands by disqualification.|$|E
25|$|In {{the sixth}} match, Edge faced Booker T. Booker T gained the {{advantage}} {{early on in}} the match. However, Edge recovered by countering Booker's top rope attack with a hurricanrana and followed this up with a spinning heel kick off the top rope. Booker T executed a <b>Scissors</b> <b>Kick,</b> for a near-fall while Edge delivered a spear for a near fall. After performing his own version of Booker's Spinaroonie, Edge won the match with an Edgecution. Backstage, a cautious Hurricane was interviewed by Jonathan Coachman about winning the Hardcore Championship. The Hurricane's sidekick, Mighty Molly, appeared and suggested the two should go to their Hurri-Cycle. Just as Hurricane headed to that direction, Molly smashed a frying pan onto {{the back of his head}} and pinned him to become the new Hardcore Champion.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the loss}} at San Jose, United had no {{break in the}} {{schedule}} with another road game 4 days later. The team did catch somewhat of a lucky break as they were playing winless Toronto FC. Head Coach Ben Olsen had a few surprises in store, as he bolstered the defense by putting Andy Najar at right back and moving Woolard to centerback. Bill Hamid was back in goal {{for the first time}} since United's season opener. Hamid's slot as the team's starting goalkeeper had gone to Joe Willis based on Willis' strong performances while Hamid was with the USA's U23 team in that team's failed effort at Olympic qualifying. After a defensive first half, with few chances for either team, United broke through on a long strike by Chris Pontius in the 55th minute. Hamdi Salihi once again came off the bench and closed out the scoring in a 2-0 win with his second goal in two games, this one coming on an acrobatic overhead <b>scissors</b> <b>kick.</b>|$|E

500|$|The second main {{match was}} for the WWE United States Championship between Booker T and John Cena in the final [...] "best of five" [...] match. In {{the early stages of}} the match, Cena and Booker fought at ringside. Cena took control as he {{performed}} a One-handed bulldog and a Five knuckle shuffle. Cena attempted an FU but Booker countered with a Book End for a near-fall. Cena was able to dodge a <b>Scissors</b> <b>Kick</b> and executed the FU to win the title.|$|E
500|$|In {{the sixth}} match [...] John [...] "Bradshaw" [...] Layfield (JBL) faced Booker T for the WWE Championship. The match saw both men gain the advantage. Orlando Jordan {{interfered}} by attacking Booker T. The referee was knocked down by JBL. Booker T executed the <b>scissors</b> <b>kick</b> on JBL {{as a new}} referee came down to officiate the match but Jordan removed JBL from the ring and tried to hit Booker T with the title belt. Booker T countered with a Book End on Jordan. JBL hit Booker T with the title belt and pinned him to retain the title.|$|E
500|$|The bicycle kick {{is known}} in English by three names: bicycle kick, {{overhead}} kick, and <b>scissors</b> <b>kick.</b> The term [...] "bicycle kick" [...] describes {{the action of the}} legs while the body is in mid-air, resembling the pedalling of a bicycle. The manoeuvre is also called an [...] "overhead kick", which refers to the ball being kicked above the head or a [...] "scissors kick", reflecting the movement of two scissor blades coming together. Some authors differentiate the [...] "scissors kick" [...] as similar to a bicycle kick, but done sideways or at an angle; other authors consider them to be the same move.|$|E

2500|$|The third {{match was}} between John Cena and Booker T in a [...] "Best of 5 series" [...] for the WWE United States Championship. Early in the match, Cena gained the {{advantage}} over Booker. In the end, Booker performed a <b>scissors</b> <b>kick</b> on Cena, who retaliated by performing an FU {{to win the}} match.|$|E
2500|$|Booker won a 30-man Battle Royal dark {{match at}} WrestleMania 21 last {{eliminating}} Raw's Viscera and [...] "The Masterpiece" [...] Chris Masters. Subsequently, Booker {{was part of}} the tournament to name a new number one contender and made it to the Final Four. After Kurt Angle eliminated Booker, he returned the favor, costing Angle the match against JBL. The storyline then turned to a sexual nature, as Angle began stalking Booker's new wife, Sharmell. Booker defeated Angle at Judgment Day. On the May 26 episode of SmackDown!, Booker participated in a [...] "Winners Choice" [...] Battle Royal, with the winner choosing his opponent for the next week. Kurt Angle won and wanted to wrestle Sharmell. Booker protested, and the match was made into a Handicap match. Angle won by pinning Sharmell in a sexual position. The next week, Booker gained revenge on Angle, defeating him with a <b>Scissors</b> <b>Kick.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On the {{following}} night, the June 25 episode of Raw Is War, Shane declared {{his intention to}} invade the WWF, and the Invasion storyline started with Booker T performing a <b>scissors</b> <b>kick</b> to Vince. On the June 28 episode of SmackDown!, {{it was decided that}} Fully Loaded was to be changed to Invasion, and would feature matches between WWF and WCW. The ultimate goal, reportedly, was for WCW to [...] "take over" [...] one of the WWF's two primary programs, either Raw Is War or SmackDown!, and rebrand it as its own separate entity. [...] To test the waters for this, the final twenty minutes of the July 2 Raw Is War telecast was given over to WCW, which brought in its own commentators (Scott Hudson and Arn Anderson), ring announcer (Stacy Keibler), referee (Nick Patrick), ring apron, and Chyron graphics, to present a match between Booker T and Buff Bagwell for Booker's WCW Championship (which he had won on the final episode of Nitro). This continued on SmackDown!, where Gregory Helms lost the WCW Cruiserweight Championship against Billy Kidman and Booker defended the WCW Championship against Diamond Dallas Page. The Booker/Bagwell title match, however, was very poorly received both by television viewers and the live crowd in the arena, with the two other WCW matches receiving a similar reaction. The decision was thus made to make WCW a heel group who was out to destroy the WWF. On the July 9 on Raw Is War, when then-face WCW owner Shane was scheduled to face Page in a street fight, the two instead attacked The Undertaker, turning Shane heel (Page had already debuted in WWF as a heel, as part of a stalker angle with Undertaker and his wife). Later that night, Chris Jericho and Kane (from the WWF) fought Lance Storm and Mike Awesome (from WCW) in a tag team match. It ended in a no contest when the ECW Alumni from both the WWF and WCW along with the debuting Rob Van Dam and Tommy Dreamer {{made their way to the}} ring. As it looked as though they were going after Storm and Awesome, they instead attacked Jericho and Kane. This led to the Raw color-commentator Paul Heyman leaving the announcer's booth and declared that Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) has joined the invasion and stated that the invasion has been taken to the extreme, leading to some WWF and WCW wrestlers (including Raven, Lance Storm, Rhyno, The Dudley Boyz, and Tazz) defecting to ECW. Shane appeared to co-operate with Vince against ECW, but later that night, it was revealed that WCW and ECW had merged, and that Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley (who was last seen on the May 21 episode of Raw Is War) now owned ECW.|$|E
5000|$|The sixth {{match was}} a No Disqualification match between Booker T and Big Show. Booker {{performed}} a <b>Scissors</b> <b>Kick</b> on Big Show through a broadcast table, another <b>Scissors</b> <b>Kick</b> and a Houston Hangover {{to win the}} match.|$|E
