If you want to pass a law that says one individual is in government, then none of their friends or relatives can work in government, then you should pass that law.|$|E

25|$|Hermeneutic {{theorists and}} {{therapists}} write that ontological hermeneutics is ideally situated {{to address this}} limitation of individualism because it upholds from the outset {{that human beings are}} relational and it attempts to explain human suffering and healing in these relational contexts. What ontological hermeneutics theory is <b>saying</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it is not through isolated reflection upon personal cognitive and affective processes that heals psychological suffering. Instead, it is being-in-the-world and relating authentically to others through dialogue that provides a nexus of healthy, meaningful relationships that alleviates human suffering and promotes a sense of the good life for Dasein.|$|E
25|$|Heidegger {{theorized that}} Dasein exists {{as an agent}} who is always-already engaged in a world with other human beings. Charles Taylor built on Heidegger's work {{when he talked about}} engaged agency, or the idea that Dasein is an agent inescapably engaged in his world. What Heidegger, and later Taylor, are <b>saying</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> that world is {{constantly}} “there-for-us” to experience prior to any abstract, disengaged scientific theorizing, and this is where hermeneutics starts to deviate from mainstream psychological and personality theories. In other words, Dasein (a person) does not need to scientifically analyze human interaction to take part in it. All he needs to do is observe human interaction, interpret what those observations mean for him, and then participate accordingly. Heidegger termed this description as being-in-the-world, i.e. human beings exist in the world as active participants who are so deeply immersed that their world around them becomes utterly inescapable, especially when trying to understand themselves.|$|E

500|$|English statesmen William Cecil and the Earl of Leicester {{had worked}} to obtain Darnley's licence {{to travel to}} Scotland {{from his home in}} England. Although her advisors had thus brought the couple together, Elizabeth felt {{threatened}} by the marriage, because as descendants of her aunt, both Mary and Darnley were claimants to the English throne and their children, if any, would inherit an even stronger, combined claim. However, Mary's insistence on the marriage seems to have stemmed from passion rather than calculation. The English ambassador Nicholas Throckmorton stated [...] "the <b>saying</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> surely she [...] is bewitched", adding that the marriage could only be averted [...] "by violence". The union infuriated Elizabeth, who felt the marriage should not have gone ahead without her permission, as Darnley was both her cousin and an English subject.|$|E
500|$|A durian {{falling on}} a person's head can cause serious {{injuries}} {{because it is}} heavy, armed with sharp thorns, and can fall from a significant height. Wearing a hardhat is recommended when collecting the fruit. Alfred Russel Wallace writes that death rarely ensues from it, because the copious effusion of blood prevents the inflammation which might otherwise take place. A common <b>saying</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a durian has eyes and can see where it is falling because the fruit allegedly never falls during daylight hours when people may be hurt. A saying in Indonesian, ketiban durian runtuh, which translates to [...] "getting a durian avalanche", {{is the equivalent of}} the English phrase [...] "windfall gain". Nevertheless, signs warning people not to linger under durian trees are found in Indonesia. Strong nylon or woven rope nettings are often strung between durian trees in orchards, serving a threefold purpose: the nets aid {{in the collection of the}} mature fruits, deter ground-level scavengers, and most importantly, prevent the durians from falling onto people.|$|E
2500|$|Among {{those to}} defend Gibson were Orthodox Jewish Rabbi Daniel Lapin and radio {{personality}} Michael Medved. Referring to ADL National Director Abraham Foxman, Rabbi Lapin {{said that by}} calling The Passion of the Christ anti-Semitic, [...] "what he is <b>saying</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the only way (for Christians) to escape the wrath of Foxman is to repudiate (their own) faith." ...|$|E

2500|$|To {{understand}} this axiom schema, {{note that the}} set B must be a subset of A. Thus, what the axiom schema is really <b>saying</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> given a set A and a predicate P, {{we can find a}} subset B of A whose members are precisely the members of A that satisfy P. [...] By the axiom of extensionality this set is unique. [...] We usually denote this set using set-builder notation as {C ∈ A : P(C)}. Thus the essence of the axiom is: ...|$|E
2500|$|For filmmakers to {{do justice}} to the biblical {{accounts}} of the passion, they must complement their artistic vision with sound scholarship, which includes knowledge of how the passion accounts have been used historically to disparage and attack Jews and Judaism. Absent such scholarly and theological understanding, productions such as The Passion could likely falsify history and fuel the animus of those who hate Jews. Rabbi Daniel Lapin, the head of the Toward Tradition organization, criticized this statement, and said of Abraham Foxman, the head of the ADL, [...] "what he is <b>saying</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the only way to escape the wrath of Foxman is to repudiate your faith".|$|E
2500|$|When Schopenhauer {{identifies}} the noumenon with the desires, needs, and impulses in {{us that we}} name [...] "will", what he is <b>saying</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we participate in the reality of an otherwise unachievable world outside the mind through will. We cannot prove that our mental picture of an outside world corresponds with a reality by reasoning; through will, we know—without thinking—that the world can stimulate us. We suffer fear, or desire: these states arise involuntarily; they arise prior to reflection; they arise even when the conscious mind would prefer to hold them at bay. The rational mind is, for Schopenhauer, a leaf borne along in a stream of pre-reflective and largely unconscious emotion. That stream is will, and through will, if not through logic, we can participate in the underlying reality beyond mere phenomena. It {{is for this reason}} that Schopenhauer {{identifies the}} noumenon with what we call our will.|$|E

[...] In reality, it is local ordinaries, not the Society, that in the document are authorized, if they wish, to delegate jurisdiction to SSPX priests to assist canonically at some marriages.|$|E
