60|$|There was {{a chorus}} of assent. The troop {{dismounted}} at once. The girths were loosened, the bits taken from the horses' mouths, and they were turned loose to graze in the long grass {{at the foot of}} the hill. There was no fear of their attempting to stray, after their journey of the morning. Some of the men set to to cut brush, and in a few minutes a fire was lighted. One of the sheep, of which there were several lying about, was skinned and cut up; and <b>slices,</b> <b>on</b> skewers of green wood, were soon frizzling over the fire.|$|E
60|$|It {{must not}} be {{supposed}} from these facts that the grains of chlorophyll, as they exist in living plants, cannot be attacked by the secretion; for these grains consist of protoplasm merely coloured by chlorophyll. My son Francis placed a thin slice of spinach leaf, moistened with saliva, on a leaf of Drosera, and other <b>slices</b> <b>on</b> damp cotton-wool, all exposed to the same temperature. After 19 hrs. the slice on the leaf of Drosera was bathed in much secretion from the inflected tentacles, and was now examined under the microscope. No perfect grains of chlorophyll could be distinguished; some were shrunken, of a yellowish-green colour, and collected {{in the middle of}} the cells; others were disintegrated and formed a yellowish mass, likewise {{in the middle of the}} cells. On the other hand, in the slices surrounded by damp cotton-wool, the grains of chlorophyll were green and as perfect as ever. My son also placed some slices in artificial gastric juice, and these were acted on in nearly the same manner as by the secretion. We have seen that bits of fresh cabbage and spinach leaves cause the tentacles to be inflected and the glands to pour forth much acid secretion; and there can be little doubt that it is the protoplasm forming the grains of chlorophyll, as well as that lining the walls of the cells, which excites the leaves.|$|E
