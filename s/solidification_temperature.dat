The aim of this work was to examine how variation in chemical composition of silicon and copper may affect characteristic <b>solidification</b> <b>temperatures,</b> fraction solid, and thermal freezing range of investigated alloys. Eight different Al−Si−Cu alloys (Al-Si 6 -Cu 1, Al-Si 6 -Cu 2, Al-Si 6 -Cu 3, Al-Si 6 -Cu 4, Al-Si 8 -Cu 1, AlSi 8 -Cu 2, Al-Si 8 -Cu 3 and Al-Si 8 -Cu 4) have been analyzed applying cooling curve analysis technique. Characteristic <b>solidification</b> <b>temperatures</b> have been determined using cooling curves or their corresponding first derivative curves along with ΔT curves.

50|$|There {{are three}} types of {{shrinkage}}: shrinkage of the liquid, solidification shrinkage and patternmaker's shrinkage. The shrinkage of the liquid is rarely a problem because more material is flowing into the mold behind it. Solidification shrinkage occurs because metals are less dense as a liquid than a solid, so during solidification the metal density dramatically increases. Patternmaker's shrinkage refers to the shrinkage that occurs when the material is cooled from the <b>solidification</b> <b>temperature</b> to room temperature, which occurs due to thermal contraction.|$|E
50|$|The {{elements}} undergo fractionation during particle formation, due {{to their}} different volatility. Refractory elements (Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm) form oxides with high boiling points; these precipitate the fastest {{and at the time}} of particle solidification, at temperature of 1400 °C, are considered to be fully condensed. Volatile elements (Kr, Xe, I, Br) are not condensed at that temperature. Intermediate elements have their (or their oxides) boiling points close to the <b>solidification</b> <b>temperature</b> of the particles (Rb, Cs, Mo, Ru, Rh, Tc, Sb, Te). The elements in the fireball are present as oxides, unless the temperature is above the decomposition temperature of a given oxide.

40|$|When {{a liquid}} starts to solidify only when cooled well below its melting temperature, {{this is called}} subcooling. From {{nucleation}} theory, subcooling {{is expected to increase}} for small volumes due to statistics and seed isolation effects. PCM emulsions are superior in their heat transfer rates compared to larger PCM modules. In principle, the smaller the droplets, the larger is the risk for significant subcooling. Due to the limitations of theoretic models, it is necessary to use experimental investigations to predict from what droplet size on subcooling becomes problematic in a PCM. In this paper, we present an experimental study on subcooling in hexadecane emulsions. Different hexadecane-water-surfactant systems with droplet size in the range of about 0. 1 - 20 m were prepared and analyzed. We have observed an increased subcooling of at least 10 K for small droplets. The surfactants also {{have an impact on the}} melting and <b>solidification</b> <b>temperatures...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{thermally}} induced {{optical transmission}} changes upon melting and solidification of Bi nanostructures embedded in amorphous Al 2 O 3 thin films {{have been studied}} {{as a function of}} characteristic sizes in the range 7 - 35 nm. The results show a repeatable optical transmission- temperature hysteresis loop with sharp changes at the melting and <b>solidification</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Both temperatures decrease linearly when the mean size of the nanostructures decreases and they are respectively higher and lower than that of the bulk melting temperature of Bi. The optical transmission shows a significant contrast that increases up to 16 % as the mean size of the nanostructures increases. The results show that in addition to the usual decrease of melting temperature as the size of the nanostructures decreases, the melting temperatures for all samples are higher than that of the bulk. This unexpected result is associated to the contraction of Bi upon melting and to matrix effects related to the balance of surface energies between the solid and liquid Bi and the matrix. The solidification process shows a weaker dependence on the nanostructure size, and thus it is consistent with a mainly volume controlled process. It is shown that by controlling the characteristic dimensions of the Bi nanostructures the temperature operability of the Bi nanostructures embedded in amorphous Al 2 O 3 as a thermally driven optical switch can be tuned over 73 K. © IOP Publishing Ltd.
