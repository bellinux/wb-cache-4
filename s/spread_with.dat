5|$|The 15th and 16th centuries saw a {{small number}} of British castles develop into still grander structures, often drawing on the Renaissance views on {{architecture}} that were increasing in popularity on the continent. Tower keeps, large solid keeps used for private accommodation, probably inspired by those in France had started to appear in the 14th century at Dudley and Warkworth. In the 15th century the fashion <b>spread</b> <b>with</b> the creation of very expensive, French-influenced palatial castles featuring complex tower keeps at Wardour, Tattershall and Raglan Castle. In central and eastern England castles began to be built in brick, with Caister, Kirby Muxloe and Tattershall forming examples of this new style. North of the border the construction of Holyrood Great Tower between 1528 and 1532 picked up on this English tradition, but incorporated additional French influences to produce a highly secure but comfortable castle, guarded by a gun park.|$|E
5|$|The Heartbeat Extension for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) {{protocols}} {{was proposed}} {{as a standard}} in February 2012 by RFC 6520. It provides a way to test and keep alive secure communication links without the need to renegotiate the connection each time. In 2011, one of the RFC's authors, Robin Seggelmann, then a Ph.D. student at the Fachhochschule Münster, implemented the Heartbeat Extension for OpenSSL. Following Seggelmann's request to put {{the result of his}} work into OpenSSL, his change was reviewed by Stephen N. Henson, one of OpenSSL's four core developers. Henson failed to notice a bug in Seggelmann's implementation, and introduced the flawed code into OpenSSL's source code repository on December 31, 2011. The defect <b>spread</b> <b>with</b> the release of OpenSSL version 1.0.1 on March 14, 2012. Heartbeat support was enabled by default, causing affected versions to be vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|The {{biochemical}} {{basis for}} the toxicity of oxygen is the partial reduction of oxygen by one or two electrons to form reactive oxygen species, which are natural by-products of the normal metabolism of oxygen and have important roles in cell signalling. One species produced by the body, the superoxide anion (−), is possibly involved in iron acquisition. Higher than normal concentrations of oxygen lead to increased levels of reactive oxygen species. Oxygen is necessary for cell metabolism, and the blood supplies it to {{all parts of the}} body. When oxygen is breathed at high partial pressures, a hyperoxic condition will rapidly <b>spread,</b> <b>with</b> the most vascularised tissues being most vulnerable. During times of environmental stress, levels of reactive oxygen species can increase dramatically, which can damage cell structures and produce oxidative stress.|$|E
40|$|As {{shown in}} [Rudd and Schroeder, 1982], {{the problem of}} {{margining}} option portfolios where option <b>spreads</b> <b>with</b> two legs are used for offsetting can be solved in polynomial time by network flow algorithms. However, <b>spreads</b> <b>with</b> only two legs do not provide sufficient accuracy in measuring risk. Therefore, margining practice also employs <b>spreads</b> <b>with</b> three and four legs. A polynomial time solution to {{the extension of the}} problem where option <b>spreads</b> <b>with</b> three and four legs are also used for offsetting is not known. In this paper we propose a heuristic network flow algorithm for this extension and present a computational study that proves high efficiency of this algorithm in margining practice...|$|R
40|$|In December 2005, the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission {{approved}} margin {{rules for}} complex option <b>spreads</b> <b>with</b> 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 12 legs. Only option <b>spreads</b> <b>with</b> 2, 3 or 4 legs were recognized before. Taking advantage of option <b>spreads</b> <b>with</b> {{a large number}} of legs substantially reduces margin requirements and, at the same time, adequately estimates risk for margin accounts with positions in options. In this paper we present combinatorial models for known and newly discovered option <b>spreads</b> <b>with</b> up to 134 legs. We propose their full characterization in terms of matchings, alternating cycles and chains in graphs with bicolored edges. We show that the combinatorial analysis of option spreads reveals powerful hedging mechanisms in the structure of margin accounts, and that the problem of minimizing the margin requirement for a portfolio of option spreads can be solved in polynomial time using network flow algorithms. We also give recommendations on how to create more efficient margin rules for options...|$|R

5|$|The first philosopher {{to outline}} these themes was Antisthenes, {{who had been}} a pupil of Socrates in the late 5th century BC. He was {{followed}} by Diogenes, who lived in a tub on the streets of Athens. Diogenes took Cynicism to its logical extremes, and came to be seen as the archetypal Cynic philosopher. He was followed by Crates of Thebes, who gave away a large fortune so he could live a life of Cynic poverty in Athens. Cynicism <b>spread</b> <b>with</b> the rise of the Roman Empire in the 1st century, and Cynics could be found begging and preaching throughout the cities of the empire. It finally disappeared in the late 5th century, although similar ascetic and rhetorical ideas appear in early Christianity.|$|E
5|$|In architecture, {{the huge}} profits of the spice trade financed a sumptuous {{composite}} {{style in the}} first decades of the 16th century, the Manueline, incorporating maritime elements. The primary painters were Nuno Gonçalves, Gregório Lopes and Vasco Fernandes. In music, Pedro de Escobar and Duarte Lobo produced four songbooks, including the Cancioneiro de Elvas. In literature, Sá de Miranda introduced Italian forms of verse. Bernardim Ribeiro developed pastoral romance, plays by Gil Vicente fused it with popular culture, reporting the changing times, and Luís de Camões inscribed the Portuguese feats overseas in the epic poem Os Lusíadas. Travel literature especially flourished: João de Barros, Castanheda, António Galvão, Gaspar Correia, Duarte Barbosa, and Fernão Mendes Pinto, among others, described new lands and were translated and <b>spread</b> <b>with</b> the new printing press. After joining the Portuguese exploration of Brazil in 1500, Amerigo Vespucci coined the term New World, in his letters to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici.|$|E
5|$|The female may {{be offered}} food by the male during {{courtship}}. He has a brief courtship display {{in which the}} neck is extended and the head held down, the tail is fanned, and the wings are <b>spread</b> <b>with</b> the tips touching the ground. He will then attempt to approach the female from behind, and then leap on her back to copulate. The nest is typically in grassland, sometimes in safer sites along a hedge, or near an isolated tree or bush, or in overgrown vegetation. Where grass is not tall enough {{at the start of}} the season, the first nest may be constructed in herby or marsh vegetation, with the second brood in hay. The second nest may also be at a higher altitude that the first, to take advantage of the later-developing grasses further up a hill. The nest, well hidden in the grass, is built in a scrape or hollow in the ground. It is made of woven coarse dry grass and other plants, and lined with finer grasses. Although nest construction is usually described as undertaken by the female, a recent aviary study found that in the captive population the male always built the nest.|$|E

40|$|Spreads are {{confectionery}} products based on sugar, vegetable fat, cocoa powder, milk powder and other ingredients. Basic properties {{of these products}} are good spreadability in wide temperature range (from ambience to fridge temperature), rich creamy chocolate taste, and homogenous smooth structure without oil phase migration. Undesirable attribute of these products is their relatively high energy value (2300 kJ/ 100 g). In recent years, cocoa cream products with reduced energy values have become very popular among consumers and today they {{are present in the}} assortment of many confectionery manufacturers. One way to produce <b>spreads</b> <b>with</b> reduced energy value is the replacement of sugar (sucrose) with adequate sweetener. Maltitol is a low-energy poliol capable to qualitatively and quantitatively replace sucrose. Cocoa <b>spreads</b> <b>with</b> maltitol and with the combination of maltitol and sucrose (produced at different temperatures and mixer rotation speeds) have similar texture and rheological properties compared to the <b>spreads</b> <b>with</b> sucrose.
