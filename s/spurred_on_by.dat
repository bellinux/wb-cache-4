5|$|Culturally speaking, post-Civil War Massachusetts {{ceased to}} be a {{national}} center of idealistic reform movements (such as evangelicalism, temperance and antislavery) as it had been before the war. Growing industrialism, partly <b>spurred</b> <b>on</b> <b>by</b> the war, created a new culture of competition and materialism.|$|E
5|$|The {{format of}} this wave of pirate radio was {{influenced}} by Radio Luxembourg and American radio stations. Many followed a top 40 format with casual DJs, making UK pirate radio the antithesis of BBC radio at the time. <b>Spurred</b> <b>on</b> <b>by</b> the offshore stations, landbased pirate stations took to the air on medium wave at weekends, such as Radio Free London in 1968.|$|E
5|$|He was a {{relative}} late-comer to competitive running: {{in his late}} teens, scouts from a local athletics club suggested that his cycling stamina might translate to running and invited him to compete. He won the race and was <b>spurred</b> <b>on</b> <b>by</b> the victory to start taking the sport seriously and focus on running. Zersenay was adamant that his early years in cycling {{had given him a}} firm foundation for endurance running.|$|E

60|$|Years passed away, and Hannibal, though {{compelled}} outwardly {{to submit}} to his fate, was restless and ill at ease. His scheming spirit, <b>spurred</b> <b>on</b> now <b>by</b> the double stimulus of resentment and ambition, was always busy, vainly endeavoring to discover some plan by which he might again renew the struggle with his ancient foe.|$|R
60|$|Convinced {{that the}} gryf no longer {{constituted}} {{a menace to}} him the ape-man, <b>spurred</b> <b>on</b> himself <b>by</b> the gnawing of hunger, unslung his bow and selecting a handful of arrows set forth cautiously in search of food, evidence of the near presence of which was being borne up to him by a breeze from down river.|$|R
5|$|As a {{consequence}} of 19th-century Romanticism, medieval virtues like chivalry became increasingly popular among the elites. Parallel to this, medieval architecture, primarily Gothic style, returned to public attention in Germany with the unfinished Cologne Cathedral, leading {{to the rise of}} Gothic Revival architecture. Other notable examples of this romantic infatuation with medieval structures and architecture are the Votive Cathedral of Vienna and Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria. This nostalgic longing for the medieval past, <b>spurred</b> <b>on</b> <b>by</b> the works of authors such as Hugh Walpole, Sir Walter Scott, and John Ruskin, meant that architectural had once again turned from the Classical to the Gothic style of architecture.|$|E
5|$|Billiard balls {{have been}} made from many {{different}} materials {{throughout the history of}} the game, including clay, wood, ivory, plastics (including celluloid, Bakelite, crystalate, and phenolic resin, polyester and acrylic) and even steel. The dominant material from 1627 until the early- to mid-20th century was ivory. The search for a substitute for ivory use was not for environmental concerns but based on economic motivation and fear of danger for elephant hunters. It was in part <b>spurred</b> <b>on</b> <b>by</b> a New York billiard table manufacturer who announced a prize of $10,000 for a substitute material. The first viable substitute was celluloid billiard balls, invented by John Wesley Hyatt in 1868, but the material was volatile and highly inflammable, sometimes exploding during manufacture.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, the Main Roads Department focused its {{activities}} on the war effort. Roads in rural areas deteriorated, especially after the Pearl Harbour attack brought the war to the Pacific, and only the most urgent maintenance works were authorised on roads for civilian purposes. Following the war, Main Roads returned to its usual operations, repairing and maintaining the road network. The rural road network expanded in the 1950s, with Main Roads both repairing the worst segments of its roads, through numerous small jobs, and assisting local governments to seal their roads. Such activity was <b>spurred</b> <b>on</b> <b>by</b> the closure of railway lines {{in addition to the}} establishment of new land settlements.|$|E

5|$|For Sihanouk, {{this proved}} to be a {{marriage}} of convenience that was <b>spurred</b> <b>on</b> <b>by</b> his thirst for revenge against those who had betrayed him. For the Khmer Rouge, it was a means to greatly expand the appeal of their movement. Peasants, motivated by loyalty to the monarchy, gradually rallied to the GRUNK cause. The personal appeal of Sihanouk, and widespread US aerial bombardment helped recruitment. This task was made even easier for the communists after 9 October 1970, when Lon Nol abolished the loosely federalist monarchy and proclaimed the establishment of a centralized Khmer Republic.|$|E
5|$|In November 1965, {{together}} with four business partners, David opened Elizabeth David Ltd, a shop selling kitchen equipment, at 46 Bourne Street, Pimlico. The partners were <b>spurred</b> <b>on</b> <b>by</b> {{the closure of}} a professional kitchenware shop in Soho on the retirement of its owner, and the recent success of Terence Conran's Habitat shops, which sold among much else imported kitchen equipment for which there was evidently a market. Among her customers were Albert and Michel Roux, who shopped there for equipment that they would otherwise have to buy in France.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{citizens}} of Oz, <b>spurred</b> <b>on</b> <b>by</b> Madame Morrible and Boq's testimony, band together to help rescue Dorothy from the clutches of the Wicked Witch of the West. Glinda has realized Morrible, who can control the weather, is responsible for Nessarose's death, but when she confronts her, Morrible tells her that there is blood on her hands as well and advises her to smile and wave. Glinda flees in horror to warn Elphaba as the angry mob sets out to Kiamo Ko to kill Elphaba. ("March of the Witch Hunters").|$|E
40|$|Polymeric or {{synthetic}} hydraulic barriers (geomembranes) {{have been}} used in civil engineering applications for over 50 years. <b>Spurred</b> <b>on</b> first <b>by</b> the need to contain water for agricultural and potable water use and then by the need to protect water from pollutants, geomembranes went through an initially slow developmental and acceptance process. As environmental pollution pressures grew, interest and research in geomembranes as a solution accelerated. Eventually, action by regulatory agencies such as the US EPA, brought about rapid growth in geomembrane use and technology. This paper provides a short overview of this history...|$|R
50|$|The {{theory that}} Antarctica was Atlantis was {{particularly}} fashionable during the 1960s and 1970s, <b>spurred</b> <b>on</b> partly both <b>by</b> {{the isolation of}} the continent, and also the Piri Reis map, which purportedly shows Antarctica as it would be ice free, suggesting human knowledge of that period. Flavio Barbiero, Charles Berlitz, Erich Von Däniken and Peter Kolosimo are some of the popular authors who made this proposal.|$|R
50|$|As the {{population}} of London grew, so did the demand upon the workhouse, and it became so overcrowded that in 1871 the decision was taken to move the workhouse to a new site, <b>spurred</b> <b>on</b> also <b>by</b> plans to widen Mount Street. In 1883, some land for the new workhouse on Buckingham Palace Road was bought from the new Duke of Westminster, Hugh Grosvenor, thricely-great-grand-nephew of the Baronet who originally sold {{the site of the}} burial ground, and paupers were transferred both to there and the parish's other workhouse at Little Chelsea on the Fulham Road, with the workhouse finally being demolished in 1886 and converted into more parish offices.|$|R
5|$|<b>Spurred</b> <b>on</b> <b>by</b> this success, the Red Army {{planned a}} series of {{follow-up}} offensives in January and February 1943 intended to decisively beat the German forces in southern Russia. After {{the destruction of the}} remaining Hungarian and Italian forces during the Ostrogozhsk–Rossosh Offensive, Operation Star and Operation Gallop were launched to recapture Kharkov and Kursk and to cut off all German forces east of Donetsk. Those operations succeeded in breaking through the German lines and threatened the whole southern part of the German front. To deal with this threat, Army Group Don, Army Group B, and parts of Army Group A were united as Army Group South (Heeresgruppe Süd) under Manstein's command in early February.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of distributed element filters was <b>spurred</b> <b>on</b> <b>by</b> the military need for radar and electronic counter measures during World WarII. Lumped element analogue filters had long before been developed but these new military systems operated at microwave frequencies and new filter designs were required. When the war ended, the technology found {{applications in the}} microwave links used by telephone companies and other organisations with large fixed-communication networks, such as television broadcasters. Nowadays the technology {{can be found in}} several mass-produced consumer items, such as the converters (figure 1 shows an example) used with satellite television dishes.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} morning, {{at first}} light, <b>spurred</b> <b>on</b> <b>by</b> the example provided by 11 Platoon, reinforcements from the 2/48th {{came up to}} complete the capture of Sattelberg. Just after dawn, a heavy artillery barrage was brought down on the summit by Australian artillery {{in preparation for the}} final attack. At 8:25am patrols were sent out from 'B' Company, 2/48th Battalion, and they subsequently reported that the Japanese had abandoned the position sometime during the night. Indeed, it was later established that Miyake, who had been in command of the troops gathered around the mission and had been given permission to abandon Sattelberg if the situation became untenable, had decided to withdraw from the position soon after Derrick's attack.|$|E
50|$|Trueblood {{abandoned}} this prestige {{to settle}} in the Quaker hub community of Richmond, Indiana to help spur the growth of Earlham College from a tiny regional, religious school, and build it into a top flight institution of higher learning. He was {{a founder of the}} Earlham School of Religion, a Quaker seminary in Richmond, and part of a renaissance of American Quaker thought and action <b>spurred</b> <b>on</b> partly <b>by</b> the common experiences of Quaker intellectuals as conscientious objectors during World War II, although Trueblood himself was not a pacifist. He actively sought to mentor younger Quakers into his nineties. Trueblood also founded the Yokefellow movement and supported Stephen Ministries.|$|R
5000|$|In 1960, the USAF began {{construction}} of a new modern Regional Medical Facility at Clark. The new 200-bed Clark AB Hospital/Regional Medical Center was completed in April 1964 at a cost of $4.5 million. The new hospital occupied the same site (off Dyess Highway near its intersection with O'Leary Avenue) that had been in use for this purpose for some time. The original Fort Stotsenburg hospital had been located at the east end of the Parade Ground, on the site now occupied by the Headquarters Building for the 3d Combat Support Group. There has been much speculation regarding paranormal activity at this site, <b>spurred</b> <b>on</b> partially <b>by</b> an appearance in the SyFy reality series [...] "Ghost Hunters".|$|R
50|$|The 2003 Phnom Penh riots, {{aimed at}} Thai {{institutions}} and ostensibly caused by anti-Cambodian comments allegedly {{made by a}} Thai actress, resulted in the banning of Thai soap operas and films which by that time had represented the majority of screen time in Cambodia.

5|$|Using these {{metal frames}} for taller buildings, however, meant exposing them to {{increased}} wind pressure. As a consequence, protective wind bracing {{had to be}} introduced, enabled {{by the work of}} Augustin-Jean Fresnel who produced equations for calculating the loads and moments on larger buildings. Metal-framed buildings were also vulnerable to fire and required special fireproofing. French engineers had made advances in this area in the early 19th century, and major breakthroughs came with the work of architect Peter Wight in the 1860s. <b>Spurred</b> <b>on</b> <b>by</b> the catastrophic fires in Chicago in 1871 and Boston in 1872, his findings were turned into a wide variety of patented fireproofing products during the 1870s.|$|E
5|$|While Marlborough {{achieved}} honours on the battlefield, the Whigs, {{now in the}} ascendancy, {{drove the}} remaining Tories from the Cabinet. Marlborough and Godolphin, now distanced from Anne, would henceforth have {{to conform to the}} decisions of a Whig ministry, while the Tories, sullen and vengeful, looked forward to their former leaders' downfall. To compound his troubles, the Duchess, <b>spurred</b> <b>on</b> <b>by</b> her hatred of Harley and Abigail, had finally driven the Queen to distraction and wrecked what was left of their friendship. Sarah was retained in her court position out of necessity as the price to be paid to keep her victorious husband {{at the head of the}} army.|$|E
5|$|According to Cloud {{and other}} modern {{professional}} historians of Roman history, {{a fundamental shift}} in the punishment of murderers may have occurred {{towards the end of}} the third century BCE, possibly <b>spurred</b> <b>on</b> <b>by</b> specific incidents like that of Lucius Hostius' murder of his father, and, more generally, occasioned by the concomitant brutalization of society in the wake of the protracted wars with Hannibal. Previously, murderers would have been handed over to the family of the victim to exact their vengeance, whereas from the second century BCE and onwards, the punishment of murderers became the affair of the Roman state, rather than, that is, that the offended family was given full licence in how to mete out what they deemed to be an appropriate punishment to the murderer of a family member. Within that particular context, Cloud points out, specifically, that certain jokes contained in the plays of the early 2nd century dramatist Plautus may be read to refer to the recent introduction of the punishment by the sack for parricides in particular (without the animals involved).|$|E
40|$|Stalking is a {{phenomenon}} at the nexus of popular culture and criminal justice. Stalking did not exist as a crime until 1990, and {{in the span of}} less than a decade, at least four countries, and all 50 U. S. States, passed legislation criminalizing such conduct. This enormous mobilization of political and criminal justice resources was <b>spurred</b> <b>on</b> significantly <b>by</b> the media constructions of stalking as a public risk. These constructions capitalized on the societal fascination with celebrity, crime, and the victimization of women. The various roles the media played in constructing mythic images of stalking are contrasted with the scientific research on stalking. The discrepancies between these discourses illustrate means and motives through which the media, society, and public institutions distort popular images of empirical phenomena...|$|R

40|$|Our {{understanding}} of the composition and activities of microbial communities from diverse habitats on our planet has improved enormously during the past decade, <b>spurred</b> <b>on</b> largely <b>by</b> advances in molecular biology. Much of this {{research has focused on}} the bacteria, {{and to a lesser extent}} on the archaea and viruses, because of the relative ease with which these assemblages can be analyzed and studied genetically. In contrast, single-celled, eukaryotic microbes (the protists) have received much less attention, to the point where one might question if they have somehow been demoted from the position of environmentally important taxa. In this paper, we draw attention to this situation and explore several possible (some admittedly lighthearted) explanations for why these remarkable and diverse microbes have remained largely overlooked in the present ‘era of the microbe’...|$|R

He finds that his access to their old computer systems still works, and learns that they may know the whereabouts of his daughter Jordan. <b>Spurred</b> <b>on</b> <b>by</b> several momentary encounters with similarly demonic beings, Black returns to his home town of Seattle, Washington. As he visits the grave of his wife Catherine, he is tranquilised and apprehended by Group members. Waking in captivity, he learns that they seek his help against the same demonic forces he has been encountering—and that Jordan is now a willing initiate of the Group. She has now begun to powerfully manifest visions of the future, similar to Black's ability to see the past through others' eyes.|$|E
5|$|During {{his short}} time as chancellor, Corbally faced crises <b>spurred</b> <b>on</b> <b>by</b> civil unrest {{surrounding}} the Vietnam War and race relations. Tolley, his predecessor, was {{a proponent of}} military education on campus; this included {{the establishment of a}} Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) program. By the time Tolley left office, the university faced major financial issues and there was uncertainty regarding the future of the ROTC program. Corbally advocated for keeping the program and its academic accreditation, an idea which was opposed by students hostile to a military presence on campus, some of whom participated in a sit-in of the ROTC building in February 1970. The matter was referred to the school senate, a democratic body composed of students, faculty, and administrators, which voted to keep the program open, a move which many students felt was forced by the chancellor.|$|E
5|$|Following President John F. Kennedy's 1961 {{commitment}} to a staffed moon landing {{before the end of}} the decade, the United States, under NASA leadership, launched a series of unstaffed probes to develop an understanding of the lunar surface in preparation for staffed missions: the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Ranger program produced the first close-up pictures; the Lunar Orbiter program produced maps of the entire Moon; the Surveyor program landed its first spacecraft four months after Luna 9. The staffed Apollo program was developed in parallel; after a series of unstaffed and staffed tests of the Apollo spacecraft in Earth orbit, and <b>spurred</b> <b>on</b> <b>by</b> a potential Soviet lunar flight, in 1968 Apollo 8 made the first staffed mission to lunar orbit. The subsequent landing of the first humans on the Moon in 1969 is seen by many as the culmination of the Space Race.|$|E

The Gamay grape of Beaujolais still has a presence here and its own appellation of Anjou Gamay AOC. Gamay, as well as a variety of other red wine grape varieties, can also be produced under the catch-all appellation Anjou Rouge AOC.|$|R
