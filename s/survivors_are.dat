Since Thomas saved Kimberly from being hit by the truck, she is last on Death's list.|$|E

Fish that had migrated into the lake system from the Colorado River started to die off; the only <b>survivors</b> <b>are</b> the minnow-sized Death Valley pupfish and related species that adapted to living in springs. Ancient weak shorelines called strandlines from Lake Manly can easily be seen on a former island in the lake called Shoreline Butte.|$|E

5|$|The outpost is {{evacuated}} {{during the}} dangerous mission, {{leaving only the}} Enterprise away team on surface. The firestorms overwhelm the position that Daren's team occupies {{before they can be}} retrieved. Believing Daren to be dead, Picard sits contemplating his decision in his quarters. He then hears that <b>survivors</b> <b>are</b> being transported aboard, and heads to the transporter room. Daren is not among the initial group of survivors, but is later transported to the ship. Eight members of the team have died. Afterwards, Picard and Daren discuss their relationship. They conclude that it cannot continue, as Picard could not bear to put her in danger once more. They discuss giving up their Starfleet careers to be together. Daren realizes that Picard, still cherishing the family life he experienced as Kamin, has nonetheless chosen duty, career, and loneliness. They both know that Daren must transfer off the Enterprise. They kiss once more, and Daren makes Picard promise not to give up music.|$|E
5|$|The {{period of}} time between an injury and {{development}} of epilepsy varies, {{and it is not}} uncommon for an injury to be followed by a latent period with no recurrent seizures. The longer a person goes without developing seizures, the lower the chances are that epilepsy will develop. At least 80–90% of people with PTE have their first seizure within two years of the TBI. People with no seizures within three years of the injury have only a 5% chance of developing epilepsy. However, one study found that head trauma <b>survivors</b> <b>are</b> at an increased risk for PTE as many as 10years after moderate TBI and over 20years after severe TBI. Since head trauma is fairly common and epilepsy can occur late after the injury, it can be difficult to determine whether a case of epilepsy resulted from head trauma in the past or whether the trauma was incidental.|$|E
5|$|Following the inquiry, Lyubov {{visits the}} Athshean town {{he had been}} studying. He meets Selver, hoping to rebuild their friendship, but Selver rebuffs him, telling him {{to stay away from}} the town center. Two nights later, Selver leads the Athsheans in a massive attack on Centralville. Although the attack {{deliberately}} avoids Lyubov's house, Lyubov leaves during the attack and is killed by a collapsing building. The attack kills all of the women in the colony; the men that survive are herded into a compound and held prisoner. Selver tells them that the attack was in retaliation for Davidson's killings in the south, which the <b>survivors</b> <b>are</b> ignorant of. Selver states that if the Terrans agree to restrict themselves to a small area and agree to avoid conflict with the Athsheans, they will be left in peace until the next Terran ship arrives to take them off the colony. The survivors agree to his terms, and order all their remaining outposts to withdraw, including the one at which Davidson lives.|$|E
