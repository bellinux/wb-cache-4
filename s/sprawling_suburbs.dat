5|$|Other approaches, {{loosely based}} around New Urbanism, are {{successfully}} reducing environmental impacts by altering {{the built environment}} to create and preserve sustainable cities which support sustainable transport. Residents in compact urban neighborhoods drive fewer miles, and have significantly lower environmental impacts {{across a range of}} measures, compared with those living in <b>sprawling</b> <b>suburbs.</b> In sustainable architecture the recent movement of New Classical Architecture promotes a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops smart growth, architectural tradition and classical design. This in contrast to modernist and globally uniform architecture, as well as opposing solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl. Both trends started in the 1980s. The concept of Circular flow land use management has also been introduced in Europe to promote sustainable land use patterns that strive for compact cities and a reduction of greenfield land take by urban sprawl.|$|E
25|$|The <b>sprawling</b> <b>suburbs</b> furthest {{from the}} city centre are {{generally}} populated by Tanzanians of African descent, {{with the exception of}} Oyster Bay, where there is a large population of foreign expatriates.

25|$|The city is {{bisected}} geographically {{and culturally}} by the North Canadian River, which basically divides North Oklahoma City and South Oklahoma City. The two-halves {{of the city}} were actually founded and plotted as separate cities, but soon grew together. The north side is characterized by very diverse and fashionable urban neighborhoods near the city center and <b>sprawling</b> <b>suburbs</b> further north. South Oklahoma City is generally more blue collar working class and significantly more industrial, having grown up around the Stockyards and meat packing plants {{at the turn of}} the century, and is the center of the city's rapidly growing Latino community.|$|E

50|$|As a result, in Dutch towns all neighbourhoods {{are close}} to city centers, {{enabling}} inhabitants to get around quickly and cheaply by bike. Getting out of town doesn't involve driving through ever-ongoing <b>sprawled</b> <b>suburbs,</b> making it easy and popular to visit rural areas. By all these regulations, for instance the Groene Hart (Green Hart amid the Randstad) is kept green, while buffers around cities like Amsterdam, Utrecht and Delft avoids getting the cities grown together entirely.|$|R
50|$|The {{line was}} {{originally}} opened in March 1975 to transport Sany≈ç Shinkansen trains from the Hakata terminal to Hakata Depot in Kasuga. At that time, Kasuga was a rural region {{and did not}} merit a railway station of its own. By the late 1980s, however, the area had become a <b>sprawling</b> <b>suburb</b> of Fukuoka. JR decided to build a station adjacent to the depot, and inaugurated service on 1 April 1990 with 0 Series Shinkansen trains.|$|R
25|$|Various current {{movements}} in urban design seek to create sustainable urban environments with long-lasting structures, buildings {{and a great}} liveability for its inhabitants.

60|$|The train swayed {{and rattled}} on its way. We ran through old Bromstead, where once I had played with cities and armies on the nursery floor. The <b>sprawling</b> <b>suburbs</b> with their {{scattered}} lights {{gave way to}} dim tree-set country under a cloud-veiled, intermittently shining moon. We passed Cardcaster Place. Perhaps old Wardingham, that pillar of the old Conservatives, was there, fretting over his unsuccessful struggle with our young Toryism. Little he recked of this new turn of the wheel and how it would confirm his contempt of all our novelties. Perhaps some faint intimation drew him {{to the window to}} see behind the stems of the young fir trees that bordered his domain, the little string of lighted carriage windows gliding southward....|$|E

60|$|A {{traveller}} {{sees the}} hundred {{branches of a}} tree long before he is near enough to see its single and simple root; he generally sees the scattered or <b>sprawling</b> <b>suburbs</b> of a town long before he has looked upon the temple or the market-place. So far I have given impressions of the most motley things merely as they came, in chronological and not in logical order; the first flying vision of Islam {{as a sort of}} sea, with something both of the equality and the emptiness and the grandeur of its purple seas of sand; the first sharp silhouette of Jerusalem, like Mount St. Michael, lifting above that merely Moslem flood a crag still crowned with the towers of the Crusaders; the mere kaleidoscope of the streets, with little more than a hint of the heraldic meaning of the colours; a merely personal impression of a few of the leading figures whom I happened to meet first, and only the faintest suggestion of the groups for which they stood. So far I have not even tidied up my own first impressions of the place; far less advanced a plan for tidying up the place itself.|$|E
60|$|Imagine {{that going}} forth! In their days the <b>sprawling</b> <b>suburbs</b> of Victorian times with their vile roads, petty houses, foolish little gardens of shrub and geranium, {{and all their}} futile, pretentious privacies, had disappeared: the towering {{buildings}} of the new age, the mechanical ways, the electric and water mains, all {{came to an end}} together, like a wall, like a cliff, near four hundred feet in height, abrupt and sheer. All about the city spread the carrot, swede, and turnip fields of the Food Company, vegetables that were the basis of a thousand varied foods, and weeds and hedgerow tangles had been utterly extirpated. The incessant expense of weeding that went on year after year in the petty, wasteful and barbaric farming of the ancient days, the Food Company had economised for ever more by a campaign of extermination. Here and there, however, neat rows of bramble standards and apple trees with whitewashed stems, intersected the fields, and at places groups of gigantic teazles reared their favoured spikes. Here and there huge agricultural machines hunched under waterproof covers. The mingled waters of the Wey and Mole and Wandle ran in rectangular channels; and wherever a gentle elevation of the ground permitted a fountain of deodorised sewage distributed its benefits athwart the land and made a rainbow of the sunlight.|$|E

50|$|Since 2000, {{downtown}} Kansas City {{has undergone}} a virtual renaissance. During the 1950s and 1960s, as many downtown residents moved south and north to Kansas City's <b>sprawling</b> <b>suburbs,</b> downtown's population dwindled. By the 1980s, downtown Kansas City consisted mostly of office towers, with few thriving neighborhoods remaining. However, major downtown redevelopment has brought back thousands of residents; with them has come {{a need for more}} buildings and more density.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the larger}} area {{consumed}} by <b>sprawling</b> <b>suburbs</b> compared to urban neighborhoods, more farmland and wildlife habitats are displaced per resident. As forest cover is cleared and covered with impervious surfaces (concrete and asphalt) in the suburbs, rainfall is less effectively absorbed into the groundwater aquifers. This threatens both {{the quality and quantity}} of water supplies. Sprawl increases water pollution as rain water picks up gasoline, motor oil, heavy metals, and other pollutants in runoff from parking lots and roads.|$|E

Today, the city's economy relies mostly on trade and tourism with some old industries undergoing partial revival, such as food (fishing, olive, wine production), paper, concrete and chemicals.

50|$|On June 30, 2011, {{the longest}} bridge over water opened in Qingdao. The bridge, Haiwan Bridge, is 26.4 mi long and connects Qingdao to an {{offshore}} island, Huangdao. It would easily cross the English Channel and is almost three miles (3 mi) {{longer than the}} previous record-holder, the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway in the American state of Louisiana. Haiwan Bridge is supported by more than 5,000 pillars and costs about 10 billion yuan which is about 1.5 billion dollars. The bridge was designed by the Shandong Gausu Group and the construction lasted for four years. Haiwan Bridge cut the commute between the city of Qingdao and the <b>sprawling</b> <b>suburb</b> of Huangdao by 30 minutes. At least 10,000 workers toiled in two teams around the clock to build the bridge, which was constructed from opposite ends.
