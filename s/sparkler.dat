5|$|Faust {{began to}} work out concept sketches, several of which {{appeared}} on her DeviantArt page, including ponies from the original series (Twilight, Applejack, Firefly, Surprise, Posey and <b>Sparkler),</b> which later provided the core for the main cast of the show. Hasbro approved the show with Faust as Executive Producer {{and asked her to}} complete the pitch bible. In order to do so, Faust brought in Martin Ansolabehere and Paul Rudish, who had worked on other animated shows with her. Faust credits Rudish for the inspiration of the pegasus ponies controlling the weather in Equestria, as well as the character of Nightmare Moon during this period. Faust also consulted Craig McCracken, her husband and also an animator and creator of The Powerpuff Girls and Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends. After seeing the initial version of the pitch bible, Hasbro requested more character designs from Faust's team; subsequently, Faust brought aboard Dave Dunnet and Lynne Naylor to further refine the background and character styles.|$|E
5|$|Patrice {{decides to}} perform the final scene of a {{vaudeville}} play he has written called La Pendule (The Clock). He explains the complex plot and characters: set in 1929 in a townhouse in Provence, the play involves the Duke of Ponfouy and his family, associates and household servants. He performs the scene, playing all the characters himself and exaggerating their voices and mannerisms. For Patrice's final act, he plays a recording of Rémi and himself from 1985, then sings a song he has written about Rémi and the accident. When the audience applauds the song, he criticises them as {{he does not want}} to be a famous comedian. After imitating a marionette, he performs his curtain call with a toy dragon; he dances with it and a <b>sparkler,</b> and flaps its wings to Johann Strauss I's Radetzky March.|$|E

25|$|A small flip tap {{and a short}} spout is the {{standard}} neck for dispensing cask ale. An alternative is a long spout with a tight 180° turn, called a swan-neck, {{which is designed to}} force the beer into the glass, agitating it so that a fuller head is created. Some drinkers disapprove of swan-necks, believing that flavour is reduced. In some pubs a small device or cap, known as a <b>sparkler,</b> is fitted {{to the end of the}} spout and acts like a sprinkler at the end of a hose pipe. This can be twisted to regulate the flow of the beer. When the <b>sparkler</b> is tight, the beer is severely agitated resulting in a creamy head; it is softer and creamier with less bitterness.|$|E

25|$|The Colectiv nightclub {{fire was}} a deadly fire in Bucharest, Romania, on 30 October 2015, which killed 64 people (26 on site, 38 in hospitals) and injured 147. The fire, the worst {{incident}} in Romania since the Balotești plane crash, occurred during a free concert {{performed by the}} metalcore band Goodbye to Gravity to celebrate the release of their new album, Mantras of War. The band's pyrotechnics, consisting of <b>sparkler</b> firework candles, ignited the club's flammable polyurethane acoustic foam, and the fire spread rapidly. Most {{of the victims were}} poisoned by toxins released from the burning foam. Overwhelmed by the high number of victims, Romanian authorities transferred some of the seriously injured to hospitals in Israel, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, the United Kingdom, Norway, Germany and France. Mass protests over the corruption linked to the fire led to the resignation of the Prime Minister of Romania, Victor Ponta.|$|E
25|$|Tarzan has {{appeared}} in many comic books from numerous publishers over the years. The character's earliest comic book appearances were in comic strip reprints published in several titles, such as <b>Sparkler,</b> Tip Top Comics and Single Series. Western Publishing published Tarzan in Dell Comics's Four Color Comics #134 & 161 in 1947, before giving him his own series, Tarzan, published through Dell Comics and later Gold Key Comics from January–February 1948 to February 1972). DC took over the series in 1972, publishing Tarzan #207–258 from April 1972 to February 1977, including work by Joe Kubert. In 1977 the series moved to Marvel Comics, which restarted the numbering rather than assuming that used by the previous publishers. Marvel issued Tarzan #1–29 (as well as three Annuals), from June 1977 to October 1979, mainly by John Buscema. Following {{the conclusion of the}} Marvel series the character had no regular comic book publisher for a number of years. During this period Blackthorne Comics published Tarzan in 1986, and Malibu Comics published Tarzan comics in 1992. Dark Horse Comics has published various Tarzan series from 1996 to the present, including reprints of works from previous publishers like Gold Key and DC, and joint projects with other publishers featuring crossovers with other characters.|$|E

500|$|... "Love a Woman" [...] is a down-tempo soulful R ballad with {{a female}} {{empowerment}} theme and live-sounding instruments. The soothing track starts off with Blige singing with a dark voice, [...] "So {{you think you know}} how to love a woman/ But I think it's still some things you need to know." [...] As the flowery instrumental builds with a serene piano melody and accentuating horns, Blige goes on to warn that a woman needs more than material things. A writer of Billboard magazine further noted that the song was schooling men on just how good to love a woman. During her lines, Beyoncé sings with a vibrato voice, [...] "A woman / Needs you to make love to her / She needs more than sex / Oh, a real woman needs a real man / They don’t talk about it, be about it / Put that work in, still shows his woman real romance". According to Rob Markman of MTV News, [...] "From there, the song plays as a lyrical how-to. Communication is a must, as is respect, but coming home late and being a one-minute man is a no-no." [...] Writers further noted that the duet was inspired by the music from the 1990s including a new jack swing-era R production. Beyoncé and Blige further sing the lines [...] "She doesn’t want makeup sex, she wants your respect." [...] The song also has an extended bridge section during the 2:30 mark where Blige sings the lines [...] "Pick up your phone…just to say you're still in love from time to time…" [...] with a vocal styling which was compared to Michael Jackson's [...] "Off the Wall" [...] era. It ends with the sound of <b>sparkler</b> synths.Jada Gomez-Lacayo of HipHopDx compared the song with Aaron Hall's material. Ayanna Guyhto of Yahoo! Music compared the first minute of the song with Busta Rhymes' songs due to the speedy wordplay. She further noted that it was similar to the songs by Keith Sweat from the 1990s.|$|E

Fred Bereswill, the investigator from Boeing, said that this {{would suggest that the}} source of the fire would have had properties like a <b>sparkler,</b> with the source including its own oxidising agent. [...] A British fire and explosion analyst examined the exterior skin of the aircraft which had been located above the pallet; the analyst found that the skin became as hot as 300 degrees Celsius.

The French crew ran their boat on shore and cut her masts and rigging. Nevertheless, the British towed her off despite heavy small-arms fire from the shore. The prize was the privateer rowboat Victoire, mounting four swivel guns, 26 oars, and having a crew of at least 40 men, {{under the command of}} Captain Barier. Price described her as [...] "quite new... the completest Boat for the Service of the Islands that possibly could be constructed."
