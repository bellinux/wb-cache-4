The advisory opinion is critically examined in the light of international law and of United Nations Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). The responsibilities of the European Union in Kosovo are also scrutinized, with regard to the mandate <b>of</b> <b>EULEX</b> <b>Kosovo,</b> the role <b>of</b> the EU as a facilitator of the dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina, and the European perspective for Kosovo and the Western Balkans...|$|R
40|$|Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) police/rule of law {{missions}} in the Western Balkans are increasingly guided by externally imposed normative agendas that respond primarily to EU internal security needs rather than functional imperatives or local realities. In line with these needs, EU police reform efforts tend to prioritise effectiveness and crime fighting over longer- term democratic policing and good governance reforms. In practice {{this means that}} police reform initiatives are technocratically oriented, yet value ridden fitting EU security concerns and needs. As a result, the police reform process can be—and often is—disconnected from the political and socio-economic reforms necessary for long-term stability and sustainable peace. Police assistance in Bosnia and Herzegovina has been shaped by a determined albeit questionable focus on organised crime and corruption. The focus of EU police reform in Macedonia on primarily crime-fighting aspects of policing has compromised {{the functioning of the}} Macedonian police. Similarly, the politics of (non-) recognition of Kosovo's self-proclaimed independence and the intrusiveness <b>of</b> <b>EULEX</b> <b>Kosovo's</b> executive mandate contravene meeting local challenges...|$|R
40|$|Here we {{have studied}} the {{international}} circumstances that have affected the deployment <b>of</b> the <b>EULEX</b> Mission in <b>Kosovo.</b> The <b>EULEX</b> mission is the European Union Mission for the Rule of Law in Kosovo. Its main goal is to advise, assist and support the Kosovo authorities in issues {{of the rule of}} law, especially in the field of police, judiciary and customs performance. Also this mission has the responsibility to develop and further strengthen the independent multi-ethnic justice system in Kosovo, by ensuring that the rule of law institutions are not politically influenced and that they meet the known international standards and best European practices. This mission was foreseen to be deployed to Kosovo, based on the Ahtissari Comprehensive Status Proposal for Kosovo, but due to its non-approval by the UN Security Council, its full implementation was delayed until December 2008. EULEX acts within the framework of Resolution 1244 of the UN Security Council and under a single chain of command in Brussels. EULEX officials have supported Kosovo Police, the Judiciary system and Kosovo Customs, through MMA actions for achieving objectives and goals that are foreseen by the program strategy <b>of</b> <b>EULEX.</b> But in terms <b>of</b> efficiency, <b>EULEX</b> has only achieved modest results. In the northern part <b>of</b> <b>Kosovo,</b> <b>EULEX</b> has failed, {{as a result of its}} ambivalent mandate and incoherence of EU Foreign and Security Policy...|$|R

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis called "Operation <b>of</b> Mission <b>EULEX</b> in <b>Kosovo</b> in judiciary {{and police}} in years 2008 - 2014 " deals with operating of the European Unions' civilian {{rule of law}} mission in Kosovo from the point <b>of</b> view <b>of</b> <b>EULEX</b> itself. The aim of this thesis {{is to find the}} answer to question, how EULEX perceives its acting and how this perception differs from the opinion of other observers. In {{the first part of this}} thesis the historical context is described with the emphasis on the international presence in the region. The second part is dedicated to characteristics of the features of the civilian mission and it describes its structures and functioning. The core of this study is the analysis of missions' programme reports from years 2009 and 2014, where the study follows, if EULEX achieved their declared goals in the period of six years. Thesis shows on this basis, that despite the fact that mission had not achieved originally stated goals, it assesses its performance positively and this opinion is built on partial progress of Kosovar institutions. Taking into account of the opinion of other authors study concludes, that EULEX is optimistic in its evaluation and does not reflect in its reports some of the serious issues challenging Kosovo...|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} {{in this chapter}} on the European Union's foreign policy in and on Kosovo adopts a political perspective {{from the viewpoint of}} the specific Kosovan context. The focus is not on the relevant EU institutions and decision-making processed in Brussels, but on the EU actors in Kosovo and on the policy implementation and policy output on the ground. It not only illuminates the EU's policy in Kosovo from and EU perspective (that is, to what extent does this policy achieve the objectives that were determined), but also analyses and assesses the EU's policy from a Kosovan perspective. in this context, it is important to ask questions that would shed light on the EU's policy within the specific Kosovan context, while examining {{the extent to which the}} EU takes this context into account, or mainly follows its own Brussels agenda. The specificity of the Kosovan context being the departure point of this chapter, the following section provides a short historical background in order to point to the dilemmas and challenges with which the EU is confronted in this context, while the third section deals with the current legal, political and socio-economic aspects of this context. The latter is not only useful to further illuminate the policy challenges and dilemmas, but is also necessary to bring to the fore the broader policy agenda from a Kosovan point of view and to provide criteria against which to evaluate the EU's actions on and in Kosovo. The fourth and longest section in the chapter assesses the policy implemented by the three main EU actors present in Kosovo but that are functioning rather separately from each other: the EU Special Representative (EUSR), whose activities are to a large extent curtailed due to the division among the EU member states on Kosovo's international legal status; the role <b>of</b> law mission <b>EULEX</b> <b>Kosovo,</b> which is the largest ever civilian European Security and Defence policy (ESDP) operation and which is involved in institution-building with regard to police, justice and customs; and the European Commission Liaison Office (ECLO), which is the EU's permanent representation to Kosovo, in charge of guiding institutional reforms in the framework of the Stabilisation-Association process and for deploying EC assistance mechanisms within the enlargement policy, and as such, also oversees numerous other agencies and actors involved in implementing the EU's enlargement policy in Kosovo. This section particularly assesses both the commitments as presented by the EU itself in its external communication and the underlying paradigms and paradoxes: the 'political commitment' with regard to the EUSR, the 'operational commitment' with regard to <b>EULEX</b> <b>Kosovo,</b> and the 'reform-driven commitment' with regard to ECLO. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Kosovo {{has been}} a very {{difficult}} and slippery issue for the international community {{since the end of the}} North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) led military operation against the then Yugoslav armed forces in June 1999 1. The configuration of the architecture of the international presence in Kosovo, stemming from UN Security Council Resolution 1244 / 1999, has proved to be quite effective in the field. Both the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and NATO’s Kosovo Force (KFOR) have been able to carry out their respective mandates in a not excessively controversial manner. However, it has left untouched the decisive issue of the future status of Kosovo. In recent years the Balkan region has become a key priority for the European Union (EU) as the future of the Western Balkan countries lies firmly in their European outlook. The EU’s efforts in Kosovo build on the significant support it has been providing over the past years. At nearly 2 billion euros to date, the EU is already the largest donor to Kosovo. In the coming years (2007 - 2010), it will allow allocate more resources to Kosovo per capita than to any other place in the world, nearly 330 million euros. In recent months, after a long and fruitless round of negotiations about the future of Kosovo, the EU decided to increase its role in this area through decisions to deploy the <b>EULEX</b> <b>Kosovo</b> mission and to appoint an EU Special Representative. Both these decisions have raised serious criticism from various major international players with specific interests in that area. In recent times, concerns about the legality <b>of</b> the <b>EULEX</b> Mission and its relations with UNMIK also have been raised within the EU. The main goal of this paper is to examine the legal basis of the European Union’s decision to launch the <b>EULEX</b> <b>Kosovo</b> Mission from an international law perspective. If, from the point of view of the EU Treaty, the legal foundations of the Joint Action seem solidly based on articles 14 and 25 of the Treaty on European Union, from an international law perspective, the question of the legality <b>of</b> <b>EULEX’s</b> deployment seems much more complex and disputable. The issues at stake are quite complex as they involve, among others: the clarification of the Mission’s nature; Kosovo’s legal status at the moment when the EU Joint action was adopted, and after Kosovo’s Declaration of independence, the question of Kosovo’s recognition by various EU member states, and its relationships with United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 1244 / 1999 and with the UN Mission in Kosovo and NATO led KFOR...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} <b>EULEX</b> {{mission in}} <b>Kosovo</b> (hereafter <b>EULEX)</b> as an exporter of rule of law. From {{the deployment of}} the mission, two mainstream discourses have coined the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>EULEX</b> establishing {{the rule of law}} in Kosovo. From the Brussels point <b>of</b> view, <b>EULEX</b> has marked a lot of progress in promoting the rule of law in Kosovo. On the other hand, based on international indexes and other secondary sources, EULEX has been harshly criticised to deliver its promises in strengthening the rule of law institutions, fighting organised crime, war crimes and reducing corruption. Beyond these discourses, the paper tries to explore whether, how and to what extent, EULEX has promoted rule of law in Kosovo. The paper argues that EULEX has failed to promote rule of law in Kosovo due to 1) the costs of adaptation or compliance as function of the misfit between EULEX institutional approach on rule of law and domestic conditions and 2) incapacity of Kosovo rule of law institutions to interact with EULEX in strengthening the rule of law as a result of political interference on judiciary and police sector...|$|R

40|$|EU {{civilian}} {{missions are}} {{a tool to}} bridge new security gaps. They focus on security problems that cannot be adequately addressed by military capabilities alone. These missions operationalize the idea of liberal peace, ie {{the link between the}} (democratic, liberal etc.) 'quality' of domestic institutions and international peace. The purpose of these missions is to reform (or establish) a State security sector based upon these qualities. Taking the most advanced EU civilian mission to date, <b>EULEX</b> <b>Kosovo,</b> as an object of study, this article examines a particular legal problem that ensues when the rule of law is 'exported': in order to fulfil its rule of law-exporting task, the mission enjoys broad executive powers. This, in turn, requires that the mission itself must be bound by the principles it seeks to 'export'. The rule of law serves, in other words, both as a policy-tool and as a constraint for EULEX. As both dimensions are connected, the failure of one will likely affect the performance of the other. The article concludes that while the hybrid approach to the rule <b>of</b> law by <b>EULEX</b> is a promising tool to address security gaps resulting from new threats in post-conflict societies, the present weakness of the constraint function negatively affects the performance of the mission as a whole. ...|$|R

2500|$|Although EU {{member states}} {{individually}} {{decide whether to}} recognise Kosovo, by consensus the EU has commissioned the European Union Rule of Law Mission in <b>Kosovo</b> (<b>EULEX)</b> to ensure peace and continued external oversight. Due to the dispute in the UNSC, the reconfiguration of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and partial handover to the EULEX mission met with difficulties. In spite of Russian and Serbian protests, the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon proceeded with the reconfiguration plan. On 15 July 2008, he stated: [...] "In {{the light of the}} fact that the Security Council is unable to provide guidance, I have instructed my Special Representative to move forward with the reconfiguration of UNMIK... in order to adapt UNMIK to a changed reality."

40|$|The European Union's {{security}} and defence policy (ESDP) was invented 10 {{years ago and}} has been operational for more than five years.

The coming years will reveal whether the European Union is able to meet its ambitions to carry out a greater number of more complex ESDP missions in higher-risk theatres. While the EU has stepped up the plate to meet these challenges, the three case studies discussed in this article (<b>EULEX</b> <b>Kosovo,</b> EUPOL Afghanistan, EUFOR Tchad/RCA) reveal that the path paved with good intentions might in this case indeed lead to hell. Whereas the new Treaty of Lisbon introduces quite a few institutional changes to the current treaty regime of foreign affairs and security policy, it is questionable whether these innovations will significantly improve the decision-making and leadership on issues of ESDP and, consequently, the effectiveness of the Union as an international crisis manager...|$|R
40|$|The complex {{challenges}} {{posed by}} stabilization and reconstruction undertakings today require an unprecedented degree of coordination among both {{civilian and military}} tools of conflict response. Harnessing civilian resources has grown increasingly important to filling the gap between military intervention and sustainable peace. Policymakers within the European Union (EU) and the United States (U. S.) continue to adapt their respective crisis management concepts and approaches {{to meet these challenges}} more successfully. In light of the rising attention paid to this policy area, EU-U. S. cooperation in Civilian Crisis Management (CCM) has been deemed by one official interviewed as “an idea whose time has come”. 1 A joint Work Plan recently signed by EU and U. S. officials and the U. S. contribution to the civilian mission of the European Security and Defense Policy (ESDP) in <b>Kosovo</b> (<b>EULEX</b> <b>Kosovo),</b> the first case of U. S. participation in an ESDP mission, embarks on a new chapter in bilateral security relations. The partnership has been facilitated by the growing EU expertise in the field and the creation of the Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (S/CRS) in the U. S. Department of State. Pledging to work together in areas from dialogue to personnel training to country analysis, both actors seek to improve their concepts and approaches and aim to partner in efforts on the ground. While cooperation has come underway in recent months, attempts in formalizing relations endured several years of efforts by policymakers. This paper asks to what extent the policy conceptions and approaches of the EU and U. S. in the area of non-military conflict response converge, why EU-U. S. cooperation in CCM has come so cautiously and how it is likely to develop in the future. I argue that the EU’s ‘comprehensive approach’ and the U. S. ’s ‘whole of government’ approach are near equals in the integrated responses they aim to deliver. However, the development of EU-U. S. cooperation in this policy area has been confronted by the limitations of the larger transatlantic security relationship vis-à-vis the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). A warming of attitudes toward a bilateral security relationship will likely continue, but looking to the U. S. contribution to <b>EULEX</b> <b>Kosovo</b> as an indicator, I would argue that the relationship will face institutional complications and continue to struggle to strike a balance alongside the role of NATO in the task of confronting today’s complex crises...|$|R
