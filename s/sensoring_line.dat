50|$|CCD readers use {{an array}} of {{hundreds}} of tiny light <b>sensors</b> <b>lined</b> up {{in a row in}} the head of the reader. Each sensor measures the intensity of the light immediately in front of it. Each individual light sensor in the CCD reader is extremely small and because there are hundreds of <b>sensors</b> <b>lined</b> up in a row, a voltage pattern identical to the pattern in a bar code is generated in the reader by sequentially measuring the voltages across each sensor in the row. The important difference between a CCD reader and a pen or laser scanner is that the CCD reader is measuring emitted ambient light from the bar code whereas pen or laser scanners are measuring reflected light of a specific frequency originating from the scanner itself.|$|R
40|$|Advanced {{composites}} {{are being}} extensively used for aerospace structures {{due to the}} high stiffness to weight and high strength to weight ratios. Measuring internal strains of composite structures is of great interest {{with respect to the}} structural integrity of aerospace structures. A large number of sensors are required for large-scale structures such as aircraft. Fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor system based on the wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technology offers a versatile and powerful one for strain monitoring of large structures due to the advantage of multiplexing capability. In this paper, we present an improved FBG sensor system using a wavelength-swept fiber laser (WSFL). The WSFL provides unique and powerful output characteristics useful for a large number of sensor interrogations without any other expensive optic devices such as optical switches. As a practical application of aircraft structures, we demonstrate 24 FBG sensors were used to monitor strains of the smart composite wing box model in the bending test. 3 <b>sensor</b> <b>lines</b> are embedded into upper skin and 1 <b>sensor</b> <b>line</b> is embedded into front spar of composite wing box. Each <b>sensor</b> <b>line</b> has 6 FBG for the strain sensing and 1 reference FBG for temperature compensation. Experimental results are compared with finite element analytical results. The structural bending behavior of composite wing box monitored by FBG sensors shows an almost same tendency with the analytical result.

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} case study of production monitoring on an aerospace composite component: the hinge arm of the droop nose mechanism on the Airbus A 380 wing leading edge. A sensor network composed of Fibre Bragg Gratings, capacitive sensors for cure monitoring and thermocouples was embedded in its fibre reinforced lay-up and measurements were acquired throughout its Resin Transfer Moulding production process. Two main challenges had to be overcome: first, the integration of the <b>sensor</b> <b>lines</b> in the existing Resin Transfer Moulding mould without modifying it; second, the demoulding of the component without damaging the <b>sensor</b> <b>lines.</b> The proposed embedding solution has proved successful. The wavelength shifts of the Fibre Bragg Gratings were observed from the initial production stages, over the resin injection, the complete curing of the resin and the cooling-down prior to demoulding. The sensors proved to be sensitive to detecting the resin flow front, vacuum and pressure increase into the mould and the temperature increase caused by the resin curing. Measurements were also acquired during the post-curing cycle. Residual strains during all steps of the process were derived from the sensors’ wavelength shift, showing values up to 0. 2 % in compression. Moreover, the capacitive sensors were able to follow-up the curing degree during the production process. The sensors proved able to detect the resin flow front, whereas thermocouples could not measure an appreciable increase of temperature {{due to the fact that}} the resin had the same temperature as the mould...|$|R

50|$|Since it is {{much easier}} to {{manufacture}} a high-quality linear CCD array with only thousands of pixels than a CCD matrix with millions, very high resolution linear CCD camera backs were available much earlier than their CCD matrix counterparts.

However, , it is still difficult to buy a comparable CCD matrix camera of the same resolution.

ATP acts as universal cellular energy cofactor fuelling all life processes, including gene expression, metabolism, and transport.
