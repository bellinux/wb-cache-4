25|$|Bailout <b>supply</b> <b>pressure</b> options: If the {{interstage}} pressure for the bailout regulator {{is lower than}} the main <b>supply</b> <b>pressure,</b> the main supply will override the bailout gas, and continue to flow. This can be a problem if the diver switches to bailout because main supply is contaminated. If on the other hand, bailout pressure is higher than main <b>supply</b> <b>pressure,</b> the bailout gas will override the main gas supply if the valve is opened. This will result in the bailout gas being used up if the valve leaks. The diver should periodically check that bailout pressure is still sufficient {{for the rest of the}} dive, and abort the dive if it is not. For this reason the bailout regulator must be fitted with a submersible pressure gauge to which the diver can refer to check the pressure. This is usually clipped off or tucked into the harness on the left side, where it can be easily reached to read, but is unlikely to snag on anything.|$|E
25|$|If a {{regulator}} stage has {{an architecture}} that compensates {{for a change}} of upstream pressure on the moving parts of the valve so that a change in <b>supply</b> <b>pressure</b> does not affect the force required to open the valve, the stage is described as balanced. Upstream and downstream valves, first and second stages, and diaphragm and piston operation can be balanced or unbalanced, and a full description of a stage will specify which of all of these options apply. For example a regulator may have a balanced piston first stage with a balanced downstream second stage. Both balanced and unbalanced piston first stages are fairly common, but most diaphragm first stages are balanced. Balancing the first stage has a greater overall affect on thr performance of a regulator, as the variation in <b>supply</b> <b>pressure</b> from the cylinder is much greater than the variation in interstage pressure, even with an unbalanced first stage. However the second stage operates on very a small pressure differential and is more sensitive to variations in <b>supply</b> <b>pressure.</b> Most top range regulators have at least one balanced stage, {{but it is not clear}} that balancing both stages makes a noticeable difference to performance.|$|E

40|$|Various {{kinds of}} airflow {{are used for}} {{operating}} yarn during textile processes. In this study, we calculated numerically compressible airflows past a yarn in a thin pipe in order to operate yarn using both a circular jet and an annular jet. We proposed the way to arrange air drag coefficients of yarns by Reynolds numbers adopted the yarn length exposed to the airflow as the representative length for the higher range of pressured airflows taking their compressibility into consideration. Simulated results elucidated both the air velocity and density profiles in a thin pipe for both jets. In the circular jet, {{the influence of the}} potential core was strong but it disappeared comparatively earlier. At higher <b>supplying</b> <b>pressure,</b> the compressed air was not able to fully accelerate in the pipe because it kept high density and took under-expansion. On the other hand, in the annular jet, the influence of the potential core was small, thus the compressed air fully accelerated and expanded in the pipe even at higher <b>supplying</b> <b>pressure.</b> Furthermore, yarn operation experiments showed that increasing <b>supplying</b> <b>pressure</b> was not effective to accelerate yarn running speed, and yarn troubles such as yarn twist or entanglement occurred at <b>supplying</b> <b>pressure</b> higher than 0. 3 MPa for both jets.

25|$|Each pneumofathometer gauge has an {{overpressure}} valve {{to protect it}} against gas supply at higher pressure than {{it is designed to}} take. This is essential as the main <b>supply</b> <b>pressure</b> is significantly higher than the maximum depth pressure on the pneumo gauge.

25|$|Both free-flow {{and demand}} {{regulators}} use mechanical feedback of the downstream pressure {{to control the}} opening of a valve which controls gas flow from the upstream, high-pressure side, to the downstream, low-pressure side of each stage. Flow capacity must be sufficient to allow the downstream pressure to be maintained at maximum demand, and sensitivity must be appropriate to deliver maximum required flow rate with a small variation in downstream pressure, and for a large variation in <b>supply</b> <b>pressure.</b> Open circuit scuba regulators must also deliver against a variable ambient pressure. They must be robust and reliable, as they are life-support equipment which must function in a relatively hostile environment (sea water).|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} to a low-pressure compressor for gas supply is high-pressure storage cylinders feeding through a pressure regulator which will be set to the required <b>supply</b> <b>pressure</b> for the depth and equipment in use. In practice HP storage {{may be used for}} either reserve gas supply or both main and reserve gas supplies to a gas panel. High-pressure bulk cylinders are quiet in operation and provide gas of known quality (if it has been tested). This allows the relatively simple and reliable use of nitrox mixtures in surface-supplied diving. Bulk cylinders are also quiet in operation compared to a low-pressure compressor, but have the obvious limitation of amount of gas available.|$|E
2500|$|A {{gas panel}} or gas {{manifold}} is the control equipment for supplying the breathing gas to the divers. Primary and reserve gas is supplied {{to the panel}} through shutoff valves from a low-pressure compressor or high-pressure storage cylinders ("bombs", [...] "quads", or [...] "kellys"). The gas pressure may be controlled at the panel by an industrial pressure regulator, or it may already be regulated closer to the source (at the compressor, or at the storage cylinder outlet). The supply gas pressure is monitored on a gauge at the panel, and an over-pressure valve is fitted in case the <b>supply</b> <b>pressure</b> is too high. The gas panel may be operated by the diving supervisor if the breathing gas is air or a fixed ratio premix, but if the composition must be controlled or monitored during the dive it is usual for a dedicated gas panel operator, or [...] "gas man" [...] to do this work.|$|E

However, questions have been raised about exactly how small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in supply chains respond to pressure from business customers for sustainable practices and what factors influence their response. This study develops a framework for understanding what factors influence how SMEs respond to a variety of drivers of sustainability, which is then adapted to guide an empirical study of how SMEs respond to <b>supply</b> chain <b>pressure</b> for sustainable practices.

50|$|The outlet {{pressure}} and the inlet pressure hold the diaphragm/poppet assembly in the closed position against {{the force of the}} large spring. If the <b>supply</b> <b>pressure</b> falls, {{it is as if the}} large spring compression is increased allowing more gas and higher pressure to build in the outlet chamber until an equilibrium pressure is reached. Thus, if the <b>supply</b> <b>pressure</b> falls, the {{outlet pressure}} will increase, provided the outlet pressure remains below the falling <b>supply</b> <b>pressure.</b> This is the cause of end-of-tank dump where the supply is provided by a pressurized gas tank. With a single stage regulator, when the supply tank gets low, the lower inlet pressure causes the outlet pressure to climb. If the spring compression is not adjusted to compensate, the poppet can remain open and allow the tank to rapidly dump its remaining contents. In other words, the lower the <b>supply</b> <b>pressure,</b> the lower the pressure differential the regulator can achieve for a given spring setting.|$|E
