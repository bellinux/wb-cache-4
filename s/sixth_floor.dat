5|$|On 13 April 2008, Speight's {{body was}} {{discovered}} hanging {{from the roof of}} MacMillan House, adjacent to London's Paddington Station, hidden from public view, six days after he died. The discovery was made by railway workers at 10:00am, and British Transport Police confirmed that the body was Speight's on 14 April 2008. An inquest into his death opened on 16 April 2008, and a post-mortem confirmed the cause of death as hanging. It was then adjourned until 20 May.

5|$|Ten {{days after}} Kennedy was assassinated, the Associated Press in Dallas {{reported}} that Altgens' first photograph along Elm Street had {{captured the attention}} of people who noticed that one of the men standing in the main doorway to the book depository appeared to resemble the accused killer Lee Harvey Oswald. Those observers raised the question of whether Oswald could have killed Kennedy, saying he {{would not have been able}} to get to the doorway from the <b>sixth</b> <b>floor</b> of the building. The report quoted depository superintendent Roy Truly, who identified fellow employee Billy Lovelady as the man in the image. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) told the AP they had already investigated the photograph and also identified Lovelady.|$|E
5|$|Major Kean {{returned}} to {{the ground floor of}} the Chancery and ordered his men to withdraw into a large semicircle at the main entrance to the Chancery. Most of the Marines were inside the Chancery when the crowds outside the Embassy broke through the gates into the compound. The Marines closed and bolted the Chancery door, the elevators were locked by Seabees on the <b>sixth</b> <b>floor</b> and the Marines withdrew up the stairwells locking grill gates behind them. On the ground floor a water tanker was driven through the Chancery door and the crowd began to surge up through the building toward the rooftop. The Marines on the rooftop had sealed the doors and were using Mace to discourage the crowd from trying to break through. Sporadic gunfire from around the Embassy passed over the rooftop.|$|E

25|$|The {{remainder}} {{waited until}} smoke and fire overcame them. The fire department arrived quickly {{but was unable}} to stop the flames, as there were no ladders available that could reach beyond the <b>sixth</b> <b>floor.</b> The fallen bodies and falling victims also made it difficult for the fire department to approach the building.|$|E

A pair of identical tables, lamps and chairs are there waiting for them, stage left and stage right. The set is therefore symmetrical. The name Croker is an obvious pun on the euphemism, ‘to croak’ i.e. to die, and a name to which Beckett has shown some attachment.|$|E

25|$|Previously unknown color footage filmed on the {{assassination}} day by George Jefferies {{was released on}} February 19, 2007 by the <b>Sixth</b> <b>Floor</b> Museum, Dallas, Texas. The film {{does not include the}} shooting, having been taken roughly 90seconds beforehand and a couple of blocks away. The only detail relevant to the investigation of {{the assassination}} is a clear view of President Kennedy's bunched suit jacket, just below the collar, which has led to different calculations about how low in the back President Kennedy was first shot (see discussion above).|$|E

25|$|On Friday, November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas, at 12:30pm Central Standard Time (18:30 UTC), Lee Harvey Oswald, an alienated loner, assassinated President John F. Kennedy. The Texas Governor, John B. Connally, {{was also}} shot but survived. The episode caused a {{national}} outrage focused on right wing elements in Dallas {{that had long}} been hostile to Kennedy. For a half-century and more the people of Dallas still struggle with being branded as having some responsibility. The <b>Sixth</b> <b>Floor</b> Museum at Dealey Plaza, located where the assassin {{is believed to have}} fired the shots, has become a historic tourist site.|$|E
