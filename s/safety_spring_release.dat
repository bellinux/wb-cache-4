40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Three {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to characterize and present early-seral competition between Douglas-fir seedlings and the surrounding vegetation communities during Pacific Northwest forest establishment. The first experiment served {{as the foundation for}} this dissertation and was designed to quantify tradeoffs associated with delaying forest establishment activities by introducing a fallow year in order to provide longer-term management of competing vegetation. A range of six operationally relevant treatments were applied over two growing seasons that included in the first (1) a no-action control, (2) a <b>spring</b> <b>release</b> only, (3) a fall site preparation without sulfometuron methyl followed by a <b>spring</b> <b>release,</b> as well as (4) a fall site preparation with sulfometuron methyl and a <b>spring</b> <b>release.</b> In the second year, there was (5) a fall site preparation without sulfometuron methyl followed by a <b>spring</b> <b>release</b> and also in the second year (6) a fall site preparation with sulfometuron methyl and a <b>spring</b> <b>release.</b> Treatments 5 and 6 were left fallow without planting during the first year. These treatments were applied in two replicated experiments within the Oregon Coast Range. After adjusting for initial seedling size, year- 3 results indicated that plantation establishment and competition control immediately after harvest (i. e. no fallow period) enabled seedlings to be physically larger than those planted after a one year delay. At the Boot study site, limiting vegetation below 20...|$|R

50|$|The <b>spring</b> <b>release</b> {{device was}} used in the past almost universally on {{trailing}} type plows with one to three or four bottoms. It is not practical on larger plows. When an obstruction is encountered the <b>spring</b> <b>release</b> mechanism in the hitch permits the plow to uncouple from the tractor. When a hydraulic lift is used on the plow, the hydraulic hoses will also usually uncouple automatically when the plow uncouples.Most plough makers offer an automatic reset system for tough conditions or rocky soils. The re-set mechanism allows each body to move rearward and upward to pass over obstacle (e.g. rocks hidden below soil surface) without damage. A heavy leaf or coil spring mechanism, which holds the body in its working position under normal conditions, resets the plough after the obstruction is passed.|$|R
