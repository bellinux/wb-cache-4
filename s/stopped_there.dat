5|$|The {{restoration}} of peace inevitably meant {{a reduction in}} military expenditure, but {{this was more than}} offset by a large increase in liner and cruise ship traffic to Gibraltar. British liners travelling to and from India and South Africa customarily <b>stopped</b> <b>there,</b> as did French, Italian and Greek liners travelling to and from America. Oil bunkering became a major industry alongside coaling. An airfield was established in 1933 on the isthmus linking Gibraltar to Spain. Civil society was reformed as well; in 1921 an Executive Council and an elected City Council were established to advise the governor, in the first step towards self-government of the territory.|$|E
5|$|On January 19, 1959, {{the library}} moved to its fifth {{location}} and first permanent home, the former Briarcliff Manor station originally on the New York City & Northern Railroad (later the New York and Putnam Railroad). The station {{had been built}} in 1906 by village founder Walter W. Law in the Tudor Revival style, {{as a replacement for}} a smaller station, which was moved to nearby Millwood. In its later operation as a station, the building was rarely used, and only four trains <b>stopped</b> <b>there</b> each day. Due to the railroad's tracks ending in the Bronx and requiring a transfer to continue on to Manhattan, many Briarcliff Manor residents would drive to Pleasantville or Scarborough, which had stations along lines ending in Manhattan, and more trains ran along those lines. The passenger railroad, then known as the Putnam Division of the New York Central Railroad, discontinued service in 1958, freeing up use of the building for the library.|$|E
5|$|The road {{improved}} Independence's economy, since coaches often <b>stopped</b> <b>there</b> on the multi-day journey. However, {{the year}} of its construction {{would turn out to}} be the settlement's economic peak year. Gold production dropped off after 1884. Independence's decline in population, remote location and severe high-altitude winters cost it the opportunity to be seat of newly formed Pitkin County to Aspen, located on a larger plain further down the river and growing much more rapidly due to the Colorado Silver Boom. When a rail connection was made to that city in 1888, the stage road fell into disuse, further hurting Independence's economy. All but one of the remaining residents decamped as a group to Aspen on improvised cross-country skis during the severe winter of 1899. The holdout, J.R. Williams, remained until 1920. The nearby Williams Mountains were named for him.|$|E

5|$|Thorpe's {{interests}} in fashion and culture {{led him to}} make frequent visits to New York City—which he describes as a second home—often for engagements with Armani and particularly because of the city's status as a global fashion capital. He {{was present at the}} World Trade Center on the morning of 11 September 2001, having <b>stopped</b> <b>there</b> on his jog, before returning to his hotel after forgetting his camera. It was during this trip that he appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, which was notable because of the relative lack of interest in competitive swimming in America. Thorpe later became a spokesperson for the unsuccessful New York bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics, even promising to continue his career until the games if New York won the hosting rights. Thorpe's interests have also seen him involved in television. In 2002, he played the lead role in the reality television show Undercover Angels, which imitated the Charlie's Angels series. In the program, Thorpe directed three young women who performed good deeds for people in need. Although it averaged more than a million viewers per episode, it was widely panned by critics. Thorpe has also appeared as an extra in the American sitcom Friends.|$|E

25|$|On 22 January, {{the fire}} broke {{containment}} lines and headed north thanks to wind levels and hot conditions, the fire also caused {{the closure of}} the Pacific Highway and train line. The suburb of Berowra also came under direct threat with residents urged at the time to prepare their properties.

25|$|In February 1981, Amtrak {{restored}} the City of New Orleans name while retaining the overnight schedule; Amtrak hoped {{to capitalize on}} the popularity of the song written by Steve Goodman and recorded in 1972 by Arlo Guthrie. A Kansas City section began operation on April 29, 1984. Known as the River Cities, it separated at Centralia, Illinois (later Carbondale). This section ended on November 4, 1994. The northbound City of New Orleans began stopping at Gilman, Illinois, on October 26, 1986. Gilman had last seen service in 1971; the Illini <b>stopped</b> <b>there</b> as well. Service to Cairo, Illinois, south of Carbondale, ended on October 25, 1987.|$|E
25|$|The canal {{was opened}} to within one mile of Ledbury in 1798, but <b>stopped</b> <b>there</b> {{as the cost}} had far {{exceeded}} the estimates. The Coal Branch to the mines at Newent was never a success, as the coal was of very poor quality, and the branch fell into disuse very quickly. The price of coal in the region dropped from 24 shillings (£1.20) per ton to 13/6 (68p) but the coal was a good quality product which travelled up the canal from the River Severn. Ledbury remained the terminus for another forty years, although a short extension to enable coal to be delivered to the Ledbury gas works was completed in 1832.|$|E

Later in the quarter, Steelers rookie Jerry Olsavsky blocked a punt from Greg Montgomery and Pittsburgh {{recovered}} on the Oilers 23. Eventually facing fourth and 1 on the Houston 9-yard line, Steelers coach Chuck Noll decided to go for the first down.

25|$|In January 1945 {{an attempt}} was made to mount an attack on Vaenga Bay in the Kola Inlet. The hope was either to attack one of the convoys that <b>stopped</b> <b>there</b> to refuel and take on {{ammunition}} or to attack the Soviet battleship Arkhangelsk (HMS Royal Sovereign on loan to the USSR). As it happened neither the battleship nor a convoy were in the port {{at the time of the}} planned attack. The plan was for U-boats to carry the Bibers within range of the harbour. U-295, U-318 and U-716 set off from Harstad on 5 January with Bibers mounted on their casings. Vibrations from the U-boats’ engines caused the Bibers stern glands to leak allowing water to reach the machinery space and as a result the mission was abandoned.|$|E
25|$|After the {{annexation}} of the Punjab by the British, the young {{heir to the}} Sikh throne Duleep Singh was sent away to England, and was to stay there until British rule became established in the Punjab. After {{the events of the}} Indian Mutiny of 1857 the young prince decided to return, which was much anticipated by his supporters. At this time Mirza Ghulam Ahmad is said to have predicted the failure of his return. He claimed to have received knowledge from God that the prince will not return, and will have to encounter some trouble, and had informed many people about this. This prediction {{is believed to have been}} fulfilled while the prince was on his journey back to India, the British government decided that the prince's return may be dangerous for the government and feared trouble. As his ship reached Aden, he was <b>stopped</b> <b>there</b> and ordered back to England.|$|E

25|$|With {{help from}} the local Jewish community, which was forced to support the camp inmates, her team sent {{supplies}} of food, medicines, clothes and also money, first to Lobor-Grad and later to another camp at Gornja Rijeka, both situated north of Zagreb.

25|$|A five-mile {{right of}} way exists along {{the north shore of}} Staten Island.

The South Beach Branch, which transported summer vacationers to South Beach, Staten Island, also ceased service on March 31, 1953.|$|E
25|$|The {{score was}} 0–0 at the half, even though Denver {{advanced}} into Buffalo territory on {{all five of}} their first half possessions. After the first three drives of the game ended in punts, Vance Johnson gave Denver good field position with a 13-yard return to their 49-yard line. The Broncos then drove to the Bills 34-yard line, but three consecutive plays for negative yardage, including a big sack on third down by Jeff Wright, pushed {{them all the way}} back to their own side of the field. After their punt, Denver quickly got another scoring chance when Ron Holmes deflected Bills quarterback Jim Kelly's pass at the line of scrimmage and nose tackle Greg Kragen made a diving interception on the Buffalo 29-yard line. But again Denver ended up with negative yardage and failed to score when David Treadwell was wide right on a 47-yard field goal attempt. Buffalo then drove to Denver territory for the first time in the game, but were <b>stopped</b> <b>there</b> and had to punt.|$|E
