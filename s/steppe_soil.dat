40|$|International audienceSoil {{alkalinisation}} generally {{constitutes a}} major threat to irrigated agriculture in the semi-arid regions of West Africa. The improvement of sodic soils is generally difficult and expensive. However, a recent study in the Niger valley in NIGER, reveals that a natural de-alkalinisation is possible under natural conditions in a semi-arid climate. Transformation of non-saline sodic soil into brown <b>steppe</b> <b>soil</b> type was recorded. On the same site, the cultivation of a Sahelian fodder grass, locally known as “Burgu” was used on the sodic soil/brown <b>steppe</b> <b>soil</b> transition zone to accelerate this natural de-alkalinisation and characterise its mechanisms. The geochemical properties of both soil types were monitored before cultivation and one year after continuous crop cultivation. After cultivation and regular irrigation, the chemical properties of the former sodic soils were close to those of the surrounding brown steppe soils, which are better suited for agriculture. This modification of the sodic soil properties can be attributed to (i) the large amount of water supplied during cultivation that induced salt leaching. This is the main phenomenon responsible for the changes observed; (ii) the root activity that modified the acid-base equilibrium and consumes alkalinity. The Residual Alkalinity (RA) concept was used to select chemical tracers of the concentration/dilution of the soil solution. Here, sodium amount and calcite + fluorite residual alkalinity (RAcalcite+fluorite) were the most adequate ones. These two tracers decreased proportionally under the influence of leaching, but the exchanges between cations and protons changed the RAcalcite+fluorite, without modifying the sodium amount. Their combined use allowed us to separate and quantify the uptake of the plant from the leaching in the de-alkalinisation process. This study highlighted that reclamation of this type of sodic soils is feasible. The use of the RA concept is advisable to design a sustainable management system for irrigated sodic or saline soils...|$|E

We measured the impact of different soil transfer treatments that varied in vertical and orderly reconstitution of the main soil horizons on the microbial activity and organic matter composition during restoration of a Haplic Cambisol in a steppe ecosystem.

However, the assumption that modern Central European Chernozems are relics of <b>steppe</b> <b>soils</b> conflicts with palaeobotanical evidence from an early reforestation that started in the Late Glacial, and also with pedological studies that dated Chernozem formation to the Early Holocene. In this review we compile the most important literature on pedogenesis of Central European Chernozems since the 1920 s, according to the soil forming factors climate, time, vegetation, relief and man. Our review demonstrates that there is no consensus on the factors controlling the formation, conservation and degradation of Central European Chernozems in published literature.

The degree of synergism and antagonism may be significantly impacted by litter chemical traits, such as lignin and N, lignin: N ratio, and total phenols during decomposition (P < 0. 05). In addition, the relationship between chemical traits and litter-mixing effects changed over incubation time. Our study provides an opportunity to gain insight into the relationship between litter diversity and soil ecological processes.

Our {{objective was to}} analyze changes of vegetation in a Xilin River Basin (Inner Mongolia) wetland meadow to provide information for the restoration and management of degraded wetland. Methods We compared fenced (non-grazed) and grazed sites within the wetland for vegetation and soil characteristics: plant community composition, aboveground biomass, plant height, internode length, leaf length and width of major species, plant community root biomass and distribution, soil moisture, soil bulk density, soil microbial biomass and soil carbon and nitrogen content. Important findings Grazing affects plant dominant species, gradually replacing original wetland plants with more drought-resistant ones. It also significantly reduces the aboveground and belowground biomass. Plants in degraded wetland meadow are smaller, thus resulting in the decline in community productivity; Grazing also causes a decrease in soil moisture.

The treatments included NH 4 NO 3 additions at rates of 0, 5, 10, and 20 g N/(m 2 year) with or without water. Immediately after the experimental simulated rainfall events, the CO 2 effluxes in the watering plots without N addition (WCK) increased greatly and reached the maximum value at 2 hr. However, the efflux level reverted to the background level within 48 hr. The cumulative CO 2 effluxes in the soil rang ed from 5. 60 to 6. 49 g C/m 2 over 48 hr after a single water application, thus showing an increase of approximately 148. 64 % and 48. 36 % in the effluxes during both observation periods. By contrast, the addition of different N levels without water addition did not result in a significant change in soil respiration in the short term. Two-way ANOVA showed that the effects of the interaction between water and N addition were insignificant in short-term soil CO 2 effluxes in the soil. The cumulative soil CO 2 fluxes of different treatments over 48 hr accounted for approximately 5. 34 % to 6. 91 % and 2. 36 % to 2. 93 % of annual C emission in both experimental periods.

40|$|In the Republic of Moldova, non-sustainable {{arable farming}} led to severe {{degradation}} and erosion of fertile <b>steppe</b> <b>soils</b> (Chernozems). As a result, the Chernozems lost about 40 % of their initial amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC). The {{aim of this}} study was to remediate degraded arable soils and promote carbon sequestration by implementation of cover cropping and green manuring in Moldova. Thereby, the suitability of the legume hairy vetch (Vicia sativa) as cover crop under the dry continental climate of Moldova was examined. At two experimental sites, the effect of cover cropping on chemical and physical soil properties as well as on yields of subsequent main crops was determined. The results showed a significant increase of SOC after incorporation of hairy vetch mainly due to increases of aggregate-occluded and mineral-associated OC. This was related to a high above- and belowground biomass production of hairy vetch associated with a high input of carbon and nitrogen into arable soils. A calculation of SOC stocks based on equivalent soil masses revealed a sequestration of around 3 t C ha − 1 yr − 1 as a result of hairy vetch cover cropping. The buildup of SOC was associated with an improvement of the soil structure as indicated by a distinct decrease of bulk density and a relative increase of macroaggregates at the expense of microaggregates and clods. As a result, yields of subsequent main crops increased by around 20 %.

Recent studies have focused mostly on leaf-level traits or community-level weighted traits to predict species responses to grazing and the consequent change in ecosystem functioning. However, studies of leaf-level traits or community-level weighted traits seldom identify the mechanisms linking grazing impact on leaf traits to ecosystem functioning. Here, using a multi-organization-level approach, we {{examined the effects of}} grazing on leaf traits (i. e., leaf area, leaf dry mass and specific leaf area) and ecosystem functioning across six communities of three vegetation types along a soil moisture gradient in the Xilin River Basin of Inner Mongolia grassland, China. Our results showed that the effects of grazing on leaf traits differed substantially when scaling up from leaf-level to species, functional group (i. e., life forms and water ecotype types), and community levels; and they also varied with vegetation type or site conditions. The effects of grazing on leaf traits diminished progressively along the hierarchy of organizational levels in the meadow, whereas the impacts were predominantly negative and the magnitude of the effects increased considerably at higher organizational levels in the typical <b>steppe.</b> <b>Soil</b> water and nutrient availability, functional trade-offs between leaf size and number of leaves per individual, and differentiation in avoidance and tolerance strategies among coexisting species are likely to be responsible for the observed responses of leaf traits to grazing at different levels of organization and among vegetation types. Our findings also demonstrate that, at both the functional group and community levels, standing aboveground biomass increased with leaf area and specific leaf area. Compared with the large changes in leaf traits and standing aboveground biomass, the soil properties were relatively unaffected by grazing. Our study indicates that a multi-organization-level approach provides more robust and comprehensive predictions of the effects of grazing on leaf traits and ecosystem functioning...|$|E
40|$|The {{invasion}} and spread of exotic plants following land disturbance threatens semiarid ecosystems. In sagebrush <b>steppe,</b> <b>soil</b> water is scarce and is partitioned between deeprooted perennial shrubs and shallower-rooted native forbs and grasses. Disturbances commonly remove shrubs, leaving grass-dominated communities, and may {{allow for the}} exploitation of water resources by the many species of invasive, tap-rooted forbs that are increasingly successful in this habitat. We hypothesized that exotic forb populations would benefit from increased soil water made available by removal of sagebrush, a foundation species capable of deep-rooting, in semiarid shrub-steppe ecosystems. To test this hypothesis, we used periodic matrix models to examine effects of experimental manipulations of soil water on population growth of two exotic forb species, Tragopogon dubius and Lactuca serriola, in sagebrush steppe of southern Idaho, USA. We used elasticity analyses to examine which stages in {{the life cycle of}} T. dubius and L. serriola had the largest relative influence on population growth. We studied the demography of T. dubius and L. serriola in three treatments: (1) control, in which vegetation was not disturbed, (2) shrubs removed, or (3) shrubs removed but winter–spring recharge of deep-soil water blocked by rainout shelters. The short-term population growth rate (k) of T. dubius in the shrub-removal treatment was more than double that of T. dubius in either sheltered or control treatments, both of which had limited soil water. All L. serriola individuals that emerged in undisturbed sagebrush plots died, whereas k of L. serriola was high (k. 2. 5) in all shrub-removal plots, whether they had rainout shelters or not. Population growth of both forbs in all treatments was most responsive to flowering and seed production, which are life stages that should be particularly reliant on deep-soil water, as well as seedling establishment, which is important to most plant populations, especially during invasion. These data indicate the importance of native species, in this case the dominant shrub, in influencing soil resources and restricting population growth of exotic plants. These results argue that management of invasive plants should focus not only on removal of nonnatives, but also on reestablishment of important native species...|$|E

Each site was sampled every 10 cm from a soil depth of 0 to 40 cm and each sample was analyzed for soil N content and delta N- 15 values. Our results indicated that soil N and delta N- 15 values (0 - 40 cm) in meadows were much higher than in desert <b>steppe.</b> <b>Soil</b> N decreased with soil depth for each ecosystem, while variations of soil delta N- 15 values along soil profiles were not statistically significant among most ecosystems but for mountain meadow, lowland meadow, and temperate steppe where soil delta N- 15 values tended to increase with soil depth. The parabolic relationship between soil delta N- 15 values and mean annual precipitation indicated that soil delta N- 15 values increased with increasing precipitation in desert steppe up to 500 mm, and then decreased with increasing precipitation across all other ecosystems. Moreover, the parabolic relationship between delta N- 15 values and mean annual temperature existed in all individual ecosystem types. Soil N and delta N- 15 values (0 - 40 cm) increased with an increase in soil silt and clay contents. Furthermore, a threshold of C/N ratio of about 11 divided the parabolic relationship between soil delta N- 15 values and soil C/N ratios into positive (C/N 11) parts, which was valid across all ecosystems and soil profiles. The large explanatory power of soil C/N ratios for soil delta N- 15 values suggested that C and N concentrations, being strongly controlled by precipitation and temperature, were the primary factors determining patterns of soil delta N- 15 on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau...|$|E

CH 4 uptake at all sites averaged 7. 98 kg CH 4 -C ha− 1 yr− 1 (ranging from 1. 53 to 18. 74 kg CH 4 -C ha− 1 yr− 1), of which approximately 43. 8 % occurred in the desert steppe. CH 4 uptake in the desert steppe increased 20. 4 % and 51. 2 % compared with the typical steppe and meadow steppe, respectively. Light grazing (LG) of steppe did not significantly change CH 4 uptake compared with un-grazed (UG) steppe, but moderate and heavy grazing (MG, HG) reduced CH 4 uptake significantly (by 6. 8 – 37. 9 %, P < 0. 05). These findings imply that reducing the grazing pressure on steppe would help increase the atmospheric CH 4 sinks in <b>steppe</b> <b>soils.</b> Our results suggest that HG exerts a considerable negative impact on CH 4 uptake in a continental steppe. Further studies involving year-round, intensive measurements of CH 4 uptake are needed...|$|R
40|$|Twenty soil {{profiles}} in the Bolivian {{part of the}} Brazilian shield were studied and classified according to WRB. Parent material is Precambrian metamorphic bedrock, vegetation a mosaic of (semi) deciduous forest and savanna (cerrado type). The climate is tropical with 4 to 5 dry months in the winter. With direct calculation of CEC per kg clay (both: pH 7 and effective), attributing the CEC completely to the clay fraction, the following soil groups were keyed out: 8 Ferralsols, 6 Phaeozems, 1 Acrisol, 2 Lixisols, 2 Umbrisols, and 1 Regosol. It is astonishing to have Phaeozems. In our handbooks they are described as <b>steppe</b> <b>soils</b> making excellent farmland. On the contrary, in the study area, the forest Phaeozems are medium-fertile and used for shifting cultivation, and the savanna Phaeozems are not suitable for agriculture at all. Using regression analysis to split up the contributions of organic matter and clay to the CEC leads to a modified classification: 2 savanna Phaeozems and the 2 Lixisols shift to the Ferralsols. With that method many more horizons have low-activity clays. To avoid some major difficulties, which may occur with regression analysis, we used the direct calculation to detect the CEC per kg clay. Anyway, the WRB key has to state clearly the required calculation method. For the Phaeozems we suggest introducing a ferralic qualifier. Ferralic Phaeozems would intergrade to the already existing Mollic Ferralsols. We also suggest modifying the handbooks to emphasis the fact that Phaeozems are not always <b>steppe</b> <b>soils,</b> but may also occur in tropical forest and savanna, where they usually have low-activity clays and may be rather infertile...|$|R

The objectives of this study were: i) to investigate the {{patterns of}} soil N content and natural abundance of N- 15 (delta N- 15) values in different ecosystem types and soil profiles on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau; ii) {{to examine the effects}} of climatic factors and soil characteristics on the patterns of soil N content and soil delta N- 15 values; and iii) to test the relationship between soil delta N- 15 values and soil C/N ratios across ecosystems and soil profiles. Soil profiles were sampled at 51 sites along two transects 1 875 km in length and 200 km apart and distributed in forest, meadow and steppe on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Each site was sampled every 10 cm from a soil depth of 0 to 40 cm and each sample was analyzed for soil N content and delta N- 15 values. Our results indicated that soil N and delta N- 15 values (0 - 40 cm) in meadows were much higher than in desert <b>steppe.</b> <b>Soil</b> N decreased with soil depth for each ecosystem, while variations of soil delta N- 15 values along soil profiles were not statistically significant among most ecosystems but for mountain meadow, lowland meadow, and temperate steppe where soil delta N- 15 values tended to increase with soil depth. The parabolic relationship between soil delta N- 15 values and mean annual precipitation indicated that soil delta N- 15 values increased with increasing precipitation in desert steppe up to 500 mm, and then decreased with increasing precipitation across all other ecosystems. Moreover, the parabolic relationship between delta N- 15 values and mean annual temperature existed in all individual ecosystem types. Soil N and delta N- 15 values (0 - 40 cm) increased with an increase in soil silt and clay contents. Furthermore, a threshold of C/N ratio of about 11 divided the parabolic relationship between soil delta N- 15 values and soil C/N ratios into positive (C/N 11) parts, which was valid across all ecosystems and soil profiles. The large explanatory power of soil C/N ratios for soil delta N- 15 values suggested that C and N concentrations, being strongly controlled by precipitation and temperature, were the primary factors determining patterns of soil delta N- 15 on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. </p...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge of {{nitrous oxide}} (N 2 O) exchanges through soils and {{atmosphere}} in various ecosystems {{has been of}} great importance in global climate change studies. However, the relative magnitude of surface and subsurface N 2 O production sources from the alpine grassland ecosystem is unclear. In the present study, the N 2 O concentration profile from 1. 5 m in depth in soil to 32 m in height in air was measured from July 2000 to July 2001 in alpine grassland located in the permafrost area of the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau, which revealed that N 2 O concentrations had a distinct variation pattern both in air and in soil during the study period. Mean N 2 O concentrations in the atmosphere were significantly lower {{than those in the}} soil, which induced the N 2 O emission from the alpine <b>steppe</b> <b>soil</b> into the atmosphere. Mean flux of N 2 O in this alpine grassland experiment site was 0. 05 x 10 (- 4) mumol(.) m(- 2.) s(- 1). But the variation in N 2 O emissions did not show any clear trends over the whole-year experiment in our study site. The highest N 2 O concentration was found at the depth of 1. 5 m in the soil while the lowest N 2 O concentration occurred at the height of 8 m in the atmosphere. Mean N 2 O concentrations in the soil increased significantly with depth. This was the influence of increasing soil moistures, which induced the increasing denitrification potential with depth. The mean N 2 O concentrations at different heights in the air remained a more steady state because of the atmospheric negotiability. Seasonal variations of N 2 O concentrations showed significant correlations between the neighbor layers both in the soil and in the atmosphere. The seasonal variations of N 2 O concentrations at all horizons in the soil showed very clear patterns, with the highest concentrations occurring from the onset of frost to the freeze-thaw period and lowest concentrations occurring during the spring and the summer. Further analyses showed that the seasonal variations of N 2 O concentrations in the soil were hardly explained by soil temperatures at any depth. Temporally, atmospheric N 2 O concentrations at all heights exhibited almost the same seasonal pattern with the soil N 2 O variations, while soil {{is believed to be the}} predominant natural source of atmospheric N 2 O near the earth surface in this alpine grassland area. Also, a significant correlation was found between N 2 O emissions and soil N 2 O concentrations at 0. 2 m in depth during the study period. This implied the variation of N 2 O concentrations in the soil surface horizon was the most direct driving force of N 2 O exchanges between the soil and the atmosphere. Soil atmospheric N 2 O at surface layers is the main source of N 2 O emissions from the soil surface to the atmosphere. Soil N 2 O concentrations at deeper layers were all significantly higher than those at surface layers, which indicated that N 2 O was diffused from the deeper layers to the surface layers in the soil, and finally was emitted to the atmosphere...|$|E
40|$|Combustion {{residues}} from biomass and {{fossil fuel}} burning, called black carbon (BC), {{make up a}} small but very {{significant part of the}} global carbon cycle. These residues are universally found in soils, lacustrine and marine sediments and the atmosphere. They can be involved in important global processes, including carbon sequestration, pollutant binding, solar radiation reactions and {{can also be used to}} reconstruct fire histories. Black carbon does not have a defined structure, and since it represents combustion residues and condensates from various sources, it is viewed as a combustion continuum, ranging from slightly charred biomass to highly condensed soot, rather than one substance. There are a variety of methods, each quantifying a different part of the combustion continuum and overlapping in detection regions in some cases. Results from these different methods are not comparable, and therefore compiling a composite picture of BC concentrations in the environment is difficult. Reference materials analysed for BC with different methods would assist in drawing conclusions from and elucidating incomparable results. A structured means of achieving such a goal would be an intercomparative study where a number of laboratories employing different methods, all measure these reference materials for black carbon, and compare results. In this study, 12 reference materials from different environments were chosen to serve as reference materials in standardising and validating BC results from various methods. The materials are divided into three sets: (i) laboratory-produced BC-rich materials (n-hexane soot, wood char, grass char); (ii) non-BC materials that could potentially interfere with analysis (melanoidin, shale, bituminous coal, lignite coal); and (iii) environmental matrices that probably contain BC (urban aerosol, harbour marine sediment, two soils, dissolved organic matter). Char reference materials did not exist, and were specifically synthesised. They were chemically characterised, compared to other synthesised and natural chars and found to represent charcoal from typical low temperature fires. All twelve materials were used in a intercomparative study of black carbon quantification techniques, involving 17 international laboratories, employing seven different thermal and chemical oxidation methods. The results for all the materials analysed with the different methods were very disparate. Most methods quantified black carbon in the BC-rich materials, except two, whose harsh oxidation techniques oxidised all the carbon in the charcoals. Many methods found BC in the non-BC materials, thereby failing to exclude biases from these potential interfering materials. There was a large variation in concentrations of BC measured in the environmental samples. The chemical and physical properties of the materials were studied to elucidate how they influenced the BC quantification with different methods. The BC-rich materials were very similar, but the soot had a more condensed structure than the chars. The non-BC potentially interfering materials share properties with the BC-rich materials, which could lead to false positive data from non-BC materials and an overestimation of BC. The environmental matrices have relatively high amounts of inorganic matter and metal oxides, which have the potential to catalyse or inhibit thermal and chemical reactions in black carbon analysis. This study shows that any attempt to merge data generated via different methods must consider the different, operationally defined analytical windows of the BC continuum detected by each technique, as well as the limitations and potential biases of each technique. The benzene polycarboxylic acid markers method, employed in the ring trial by our laboratory, gave reasonable results for all the materials, in particular the soil matrices, for which this method was designed. We used this method in a case study to quantify the BC stock in a BC-rich <b>steppe</b> <b>soil</b> in Russia. This soil was sampled twice, 100 years apart, and we determined a BC stock loss of 25...|$|E

30|$|Our study {{indicates}} that comparison of changes from forest/native vegetation to rangelands in semi-arid regions tended to have a lower groundwater recharge than a change to grasslands (Fig.  4). This observation is most likely due to compaction of rangeland top soils by grazing animals. Radford et al. (2009), Betteridge et al. (1999), and Broersma et al. (1999) have reported increased soil compaction with high grazing intensity caused by the mechanical stress exerted on soil by grazing animals (Zhou et al. 2010). Both Rezkowska et al. (2011 a) as well as Krümmelbein et al. (2009) reported that grazing of semi-arid <b>steppe</b> <b>soils</b> also reduced soil water pore volume and saturated soil hydraulic conductivity. The reduced soil hydraulic conductivity was attributed to destruction of macropores (Reszkowska et al. 2011 b).|$|R
40|$|Modern soils {{across the}} Chinese Loess Plateau exhibit strong but disputed {{correlation}} between their pedogenic magnetic content and annual rainfall. A soil magnetism/rainfall transfer function {{could provide a}} quantitative proxy of Quaternary rainfall for this region. However, some argue that ‘magnetic dilution’, through spatially varying fluxes of weakly magnetic dust, controls the soil magnetic properties. Here, we test the soil magnetism/rainfall couple by examining 22 Russian <b>steppe</b> <b>soils</b> (free of present dust accumulation) across a climatic transect. From the semi-arid Caspian region to the more humid Caucasus, the soils display systematic increases in topsoil ferrimagnetic concentrations. With the exception of climate (and its co-variant, vegetation), soil-forming factors are essentially constant across this stable area. Hence, the soil magnetic variations dominantly reflect climate and from statistical analysis, principally rainfall. Further, the Russian steppe magnetic/rainfall relationship matches that observed for the Chinese Loess Plateau. These independent data thus substantiate the soil magnetism/rainfall climofunction and, by inference...|$|R
