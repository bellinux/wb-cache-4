Because phase boundaries relate to changes in the organization <b>of</b> <b>matter,</b> such as a change from liquid to solid or a more subtle change from one crystal structure to another, this latter usage is similar to the use of [...] "phase" [...] as a synonym for <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter.</b> However, the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> and phase <b>diagram</b> usages are not [...] with the formal definition given above and the intended meaning must be determined in part from {{the context in which the}} term is used.|$|R

50|$|In physics, a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> is one <b>of</b> the {{distinct}} forms that matter takes on. Four <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> are observable in everyday life: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. Many {{other states are}} known to exist only in extreme situations, such as Bose-Einstein condensates, neutron-degenerate matter, and quark-gluon plasma, which only occur in situations of extreme cold, extreme density, and extremely high-energy color-charged matter respectively.

5000|$|A hidden <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> is a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> which {{cannot be}} reached under ergodic conditions, and is {{therefore}} distinct from known thermodynamic phases of the material., Examples exist in condensed matter systems, and are typically reached by the non-ergodic conditions created through laser photo excitation. [...] Short-lived hidden <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> have also been reported in crystals using lasers. Recently a persistent hidden state was discovered in a crystal of Tantalum(IV) sulfide (TaS2), where the state is stable at low temperatures. A hidden <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> {{is not to be}} confused with hidden order, which exists in equilibrium, but is not immediately apparent or easily observed.|$|R
25|$|The gaseous <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> {{is found}} between the liquid and plasma <b>states,</b> the latter <b>of</b> which {{provides}} the upper temperature boundary for gases.

40|$|The author {{reveals the}} {{features}} of construction of the universal evolution model, which he called «Evolving matter». According to the author, the material world, which is perceived in scales of the Earth and near space, consists of visually and empirically easily detectable <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter,</b> with different complexity of the internal organisation: inert, living and intelligent matter. The transition from one («parent») <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> to another («daughter») state is caused by three main factors and two reasons of evolution. The author has carried the following factors of evolution as a complication: a) Continuity of self-complication structures, types of interaction and environments of existence <b>of</b> any <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter,</b> which is supplemented by: – Block of continuous self-complication; – Principle of block of continuous self-complication of dominance; b) Nonlinear complication of structure, types of interactions and environments of existence <b>of</b> any <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter,</b> which is specified by factors: – Hierarchical nonlinear complication; – Orientation of nonlinear hierarchical complication; c) Complication isolation. The author carries complications to the evolution reasons: a) Active principle, which is inherently {{the basis for the}} initial elements <b>of</b> any <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter,</b> and which forms a self-complication; b) Natural selection as the environment influence. ...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. <b>States</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> and phase {{changes are}} {{important}} topics {{in the teaching}} and learning of physical science. It is a common fact that learners find it difficult to understand the <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> and phase changes. One of the main reasons is that learners do not abandon their own naive perceptions when the scientific concepts are taught. They do not connect their experiences outside the laboratory / classroom with their experience in science lessons. Learners consequently hold their own views even after instruction. According to the constructivist view on teaching and learning educators need to take learners' perceptions into account in the teaching of these topics. The first aim with {{this study was to determine}} learners' alterative conceptions about the <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> and phase changes from a literature study. The second was to determine by means of an empirical study the alterative conceptions Grade 11 learners still hold after instruction of the topics. The empirical survey was conducted amongst a group of 110 Grade 11 learners studying physical science. A questionnaire was used to obtain information on this group of learners' knowledge on the <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> and <b>of</b> phase changes after instruction of these topics. From the results of the questionnaire alternative conceptions could be identified. The results of the empirical study indicate that learners still have alternative conceptions about the <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> and phase changes after instruction. Alternative conceptions were identified and recommendations on how to teach the <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> and phase changes more effectively were made. Master...|$|R

40|$|Kinetic {{energy is}} a type of energy related to motion. The faster the {{velocities}} of something, in this case the particles of solids, liquids and gases, the more kinetic energy those particles have. Molecules are in constant motion, {{which is to say that}} they possess kinetic energy, the energy of motion. The amount of energy they possess is different, depending on their <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter.</b> <b>Of</b> the three <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter,</b> gases contain the most kinetic energy and thus the most molecular motion. By explaining the forces between molecules and the energy they possess, the kinetic molecular theory shows how and why these differences between <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> and the behavior of their molecules are so. It is a theory that can be understood through four main concepts. 1...|$|R
