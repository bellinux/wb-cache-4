5|$|Walsh {{identified}} drinks as {{the central}} Diageo business, and began selling off assets that did not fit this model. He sold Pillsbury to General Mills in 2001 for $10.1 billion, and Burger King to the private equity firm Texas Pacific Group in 2002 for $1.5 billion. He suggested {{that he would have}} liked to have sold Burger King earlier, but was worried about Diageo's capacity to handle both transactions simultaneously. In a strategy to bolster Diageo's drinks sales, in 2001 he acquired the Seagram drinks business from Vivendi Universal in conjunction with Pernod Ricard for $8.2 billion, an action that was later credited with refocusing and re-energising Diageo. At the time, analysts suggested that Walsh had overpaid, and that Pernod Ricard had gained control of the better brands. Despite having entered into an alliance with Pernod in order to avoid regulatory issues, Diageo was still forced to divest the Malibu Rum brand after acquiring Captain Morgan. Walsh defended the deal on the basis of efficiency savings and the fact that the deal was almost entirely financed by the sale of Pillsbury. Of the acquisition he says:We moved in on that Seagram deal and forced their hand very quickly while our competitors were <b>still</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> their act together. If you look at what we paid it will go down in history as the bargain of the century. It was an $8.1bn total price of which our part was about $5.6bn and it was at economic profit break even at the end of year two. It’s produced phenomenal returns. If you look at Pernod’s Allied Domecq acquisition, it is 30 per cent higher in multiple terms and you’re not getting as good a collection of brands.|$|E

Islam in Senegal has been built with the religious current known as “Sufism” (Kung, 2010 : 450 - 470). In this branch of Islam the spiritual leader, called a “marabout”, has an appreciable and important impact on his disciples. Thanks to the trust and admiration of the population, these marabouts have built a strong patronage network (Beck, 2002 : 532). During the colonial experience, the French administration agreed to negotiate with the Muslim elite to capture this popular support. This informal agreement allowed a peaceful coexistence: the French colonial power received popular support while religious leaders gained several benefits including some recognition of Islam as a state religion (O’Brien, 2002 : 27). This compromise, described as the Senegalese social contract by O’Brien (O’Brien, 1981), was renewed by the new political leaders in the 60 s.
