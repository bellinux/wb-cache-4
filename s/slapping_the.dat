5|$|Batista {{was left}} on his own {{as a result of}} The Legacy attacking Shane McMahon, but {{continued}} to challenge Orton for the WWE Championship. Orton and Batista had a match at Judgment Day, but it ended with Orton intentionally <b>slapping</b> <b>the</b> referee to cause a disqualification, which meant that the championship did not change hands. In their rematch, however, which was held inside a steel cage at the Extreme Rules pay-per-view, Batista won the championship.|$|E
5|$|So-called lobtail feeding was {{observed}} in the North Atlantic. This technique involves the whale <b>slapping</b> <b>the</b> surface of the ocean with its tail between one and four times before creating the bubble net. Using network-based diffusion analysis, the study authors argued that these whales learned the behavior from other whales in the group {{over a period of}} 27 years in response to a change in the primary form of prey.|$|E
5|$|The {{predominant}} rivalry scripted into WrestleMania on the Raw brand {{was between}} Randy Orton, John Cena, and Triple H, over the WWE Championship. At the Royal Rumble pay-per-view event in January, Randy Orton successfully defended the WWE Championship against Jeff Hardy {{at the same}} event where John Cena returned from an injury and won the Royal Rumble match, where thirty wrestlers competed in a ring and were eliminated by being thrown over the top rope when he last eliminated Triple H. By winning the match, Cena became a top contender for the WWE Championship at WrestleMania XXIV. Instead of challenging Randy Orton for the title at WrestleMania, he decided to challenge him at No Way Out. In the match, Orton got himself intentionally disqualified by <b>slapping</b> <b>the</b> referee, thus retaining the WWE Championship due to WWE regulations. That same night, Triple H also became a top contender to the WWE Championship by defeating five other men in an Elimination Chamber match, which featured wrestlers fighting in a ring surrounded by chains and girders. The next night on Raw, Cena argued that he deserved another WWE Championship match. Raw General Manager William Regal, who was portrayed as a matchmaker and rules enforcer, then announced that Cena would face Orton later in the night. Regal added a stipulation to the match that if Cena won, he would {{be added to the}} WrestleMania match between Triple H and Orton, making it a Triple threat match, a standard match that involves three wrestlers. If Orton won, the main event would remain as Orton versus Triple H in a singles match. However, Cena won the match and was added to the bout at WrestleMania. After the match, Triple H, who was the Special Guest Referee, executed a Pedigree to both Cena and Orton.|$|E

25|$|Beavers {{are active}} mainly at night. They are {{excellent}} swimmers and may remain submerged up to 15 minutes. More vulnerable on land, {{they tend to}} remain in the water as much as possible. They use their flat, scaly tail both to signal danger by <b>slapping</b> <b>the</b> surface of the water and as a location for fat storage.|$|E
25|$|They {{are known}} for their alarm signal: when startled or frightened, a {{swimming}} beaver will rapidly dive while forcefully <b>slapping</b> <b>the</b> water with its broad tail, audible over great distances above and below water. This serves as a warning to beavers in the area. Once a beaver has sounded the alarm, nearby beavers will dive and may not reemerge for some time. Beavers are slow on land, but are good swimmers, and can stay under water for as long as 15 minutes.|$|E
25|$|For Perry, {{the post-war}} years were marred by controversies. In 1815, he {{commanded}} Java in the Mediterranean during the Second Barbary War. While moored in Naples, Perry was provoked into <b>slapping</b> <b>the</b> {{commander of the}} ship's Marines, Captain John Heath, whom Perry considered incompetent and insubordinate. The ensuing court-martial found both men guilty, but levied only mild reprimands. After the crew returned home, Heath challenged Perry to a pistol duel, which was fought on October 19, 1817, on the same field in Weehawken, New Jersey where Aaron Burr shot and killed Alexander Hamilton. Heath fired first and missed. Perry refused to fire, satisfying the Marine's honor.|$|E

25|$|Trogons are cavity nesters. Nests are {{dug into}} rotting wood or termite nests, with one species, the violaceous trogon, nesting in wasp nests. Nest {{cavities}} {{can either be}} deep upward slanting tubes that lead to fully enclosed chambers, or much shallower open niches (from which the bird is visible). Nests are dug with the beak, incidentally giving the family its name. Nest digging may be undertaken by the male alone or by both sexes. In the case of nests dug into tree trunks, the wood must be strong enough not to collapse but soft enough to dig out. Trogons have been observed landing on dead tree trunks and <b>slapping</b> <b>the</b> wood with their tails, presumably to test the firmness.|$|E

500|$|In the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand, the V sign or [...] "the fingers", {{when given}} with {{back of the}} hand towards the recipient, serves a similar purpose.

In countries where Spanish, Portuguese, or French are spoken, and especially in Spain, Portugal, Brazil, and France the gesture involving raising a fist and <b>slapping</b> <b>the</b> biceps on the same arm as the fist used, sometimes called the bras d'honneur or Iberian slap, {{is equivalent to the}} finger. Italy, Poland, and countries under the influence of Russian culture, such as Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine, also see it as equivalent to the finger, but the majority of young people in these countries use the finger as an insult, which is associated with the Western culture.|$|E
500|$|Keenan is {{featured}} in several segments of Mr. Show, {{most notably in}} the Ronnie Dobbs sketch presented in the first season. In one scene, he is seen being arrested with Dobbs.

2500|$|The {{magazine}} {{was still in}} print after the January 1941 Legionary Rebellion, whereby the Antonescu-Sima partnership had self-detonated. While Sima and his team took flight, Antonescu remained the uncontested Conducător.

It soon began giving credence to the [...] "Judeo-Bolshevism" [...] conspiracy theory, and was especially vocal on this topic once Romania joined in the German-led attack on the Soviet Union.
