This prediction {{takes into account the}} SR-ARQ influence on the average IP packet delay, assuming that the MAC works with a static <b>schedule</b> <b>policy</b> (offering a fixed periodic access to radio resources). This assumption allows the use of this prediction as a link performance descriptor that is complementary to C/I, BER and BLER. A series of simulations and calculations have been performed to analyze the error introduced by the prediction. The results of these tests prove that the proposed method introduces a negligible prediction error, while the computation complexity is kept at a reasonable low level.

In the context of shared event schedulers, where a common processor is shared among multiple users, one also has to consider the privacy offered by the <b>scheduling</b> <b>policy.</b> The privacy offered by a <b>scheduling</b> <b>policy</b> measures how much information about the usage pattern of one user of the system can be learned by another {{as a consequence of}} sharing the scheduler.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the effects of stochastic dust accumulations and rain events on the cleaning schedule of the parabolic trough collectors that are used to generate power at concentrated solar power (CSP) plants. The level of cleanliness is proportional to the power produced, and thus it affects the economic pay off at CSP plants. Current practice to address this dust problem, termed as conventional cleaning, is to follow a periodic cleaning schedule that entails a fixed setup cost for each cleaning event. The frequency of cleaning under such conventional (periodic <b>schedule)</b> <b>policy</b> is selected based upon a tradeoff between the set up cost and the payoff from improving the cleanliness factor. The conventional practice is to have a constant and periodic cleaning schedule over an entire season (e. g. either severe or mild combination of the dust and rain over a 180 -day cleaning season, with either 8 or 4 cycles scheduled for the severe and mild seasons respectively). This thesis draws upon evidence from recent literature to show that presence of random rain events improves the cleanliness of parabolic troughs in CSP plants. Upon analyzing such evidence, this study models rain event as a compound Poisson process that replenishes the level of cleanliness. In this scenario, it is possible to establish an adaptive threshold policy for scheduling plant cleaning that analogous to the formulation of a (s,S) inventory management policy, subject to random replenishment of inventory. The study offers a review of related literature to establish that such formulations are not amenable to a close form solution. The second half of the thesis describes a numerical study that has been conducted using Arena Simulation package for characterizing the adaptive cleaning policy. The parameter of interest for assessing system performance is the average payoff over the average cost of cleaning for a 180 -day cleaning season. Numerical study shows that adaptive cleaning policy outperforms the conventional (periodic) cleaning policy under reasonable assumptions for dust and rain event distributions. As an extension, the simulation study also examines the use of alternative cleaning system, known as electrodynamic screening (EDS), for different rain scenarios that may be used in conjunction with either conventional or adaptive cleaning policies to improve the overall system performance. 2019 - 07 - 09 T 00 : 00 : 00...|$|E

However, utility-aware <b>scheduling</b> <b>policy</b> design is an open research problem. In particular, <b>scheduling</b> <b>policies</b> that optimize expected utility accrual are needed for real-time and cyber-physical domains.

By solving the Markov Decision Process we can derive value-optimal <b>scheduling</b> <b>policies</b> for moderate sized problems.

40|$|In {{this article}} we {{introduce}} a new model to study stability in multi-hop wireless networks {{in the framework of}} adversarial queueing. In such a model, a routing protocol consists of three components: a transmission <b>policy,</b> a <b>scheduling</b> <b>policy</b> to select the packet to transmit form a set of packets parked at a node, and a hearing control mechanism to coordinate transmissions with scheduling. For such a setting, we propose a definition of universal stability that takes into account not only the <b>scheduling</b> <b>policies</b> (as in the standard wireline adversarial model), but also the transmission policies. First, we show that any <b>scheduling</b> <b>policy</b> that is unstable in the classical wireline adversarial model remains unstable in the multi-hop radio network model, even in scenarios free of inter- ferences. Then, we show that both SIS and LIS (two well-known universally stable <b>scheduling</b> <b>policies</b> in the wireline adversarial model) remain stable in the multi-hop radio network model, provided a proactive hearing control is used. In contrast, such <b>scheduling</b> <b>policies</b> turn out to be unstable when using a reactive hearing control. However, the <b>scheduling</b> <b>policy</b> LIS can be enforced to be universally stable provided ties are resolved in a permanent manner. Such a situation doesn't hold in the case of SIS, which remains unstable regardless of how ties are resolved.
