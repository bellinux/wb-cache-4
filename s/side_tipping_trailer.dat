40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design of}} a <b>tipping</b> <b>trailer,</b> from a company’s demands andrequests to complete manufacturing documentation. The design is developed for thecompany Abexor AB in Östersund that produces <b>tipping</b> <b>trailers.</b> The product issupposed to be used by Abexors customer to transport cargos of different kinds,such as gravel, stone, dirt, etc. The work commenced with a meeting at the company where demands were set. After that a pre-study was conducted to find out what traffic rules were required forthe trailer to be allowed to be driven on roads. Similar products were examined tosee how the trailer could be designed. The pre-study was followed by an idea andconcept generation. Nine different concepts were generated and the best werechosen for continued work. The concepts that were chosen resulted in a design in CAD were considerationswere taken for dimensions, traffic rules and function. Manufacturing documentationand a list of components to be bought were generated. In the section discussion and conclusions you can see what the thesis has resulted in. It’s also described what could have been done different and guidelines for futuredevelopment have been made...|$|R

40|$|A {{key element}} with which {{manufacturing}} industries should concern themselves {{in respect of}} cost and efficiency of operation is the cycle time for preparing their products. A reduction in operational time can result in dramatic improvements in both cost and efficiency. Unfortunately, cycle time problems are sometimes difficult to analyse: there are many factors related to this parameter. This paper presents a cycle time analysis of a <b>tipping</b> <b>trailer</b> frame in a heavy equipment industry. The cycle time analysis, based on the cycle time data collected by a time study, together {{with the use of}} an Arena software simulation, is outlined. From the results of this study, {{it was found that the}} manufacturing cycle time was 56 hours, and that resources were under-utilised...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} has been issued by Miedema to investigate the production process of the HST <b>Tipping</b> <b>trailers.</b> Since Miedema is adopting the lean philosophy, the company wonders {{whether there is a}} more ‘lean’ production process of the HST possible, and if such a solution is feasible. Another problem that Miedema faces is that it is relatively inflexible in comparison tot its competitors. Since Miedema occupies seasonal production, delivery times on certain products may be high. Miedema has indicated that it wants to explore possibilities to make the company more flexible, especially {{in the light of the}} current economic crisis. At the moment, demand is declining and the company wonders how it can cope with the declining sales and declining production. On the other hand, Miedema expects a surge in demand when the economic downturn has passed; it therefore wants to use this period to prepare itself for that moment. Flexibility is thus an important theme for Miedema, since this might win orders. At the same time the company wants to remain its other KPIs at the same level, for this meets customer expectations. The two most important of these KPIs are quality and the low cost of ownership. Given these facts, Miedema first wants to explore its possibilities, before actual changes are made. Since Miedema has ties to the Lean Operations Research Centre (LORC) of the University of Groningen, it has made the request whether such research can be conducted. Goal of the research is to provide management with an overview of possible production processes for the HST, weighted against potential problems and benefits. It therefore requires an independent research, to approach this question from a neutral perspective. It will support the decision making process for the future production of the HST <b>Tipping</b> <b>Trailer.</b> ...|$|R
50|$|In 1945, Joseph Cyril Bamford founded J C Bamford Excavators Limited in Uttoxeter, {{now known}} as JCB. The firm, based in the nearby village of Rocester, is the world's third-largest {{construction}} equipment manufacturer. The firm's first vehicle was a <b>tipping</b> <b>trailer</b> made from war-surplus materials, which J. C. Bamford built in a rented lock-up garage in Uttoxeter. The Bamford family had previously started Bamfords, later Bamford International Farm Machinery which was a large employer in the town {{from the end of}} the 19th century through to the early 1980s when it gradually went into decline before closing in 1989. The land and former building was acquired by JCB to form its 'Special Products' division which has now closed and the buildings demolished. The land has yet to be developed.|$|R

50|$|A {{sand and}} gravel pit was {{established}} in the south-west of the parish in the 1930s, located parallel and south of Pant Drain, the site's development was driven by the 1930s building boom. The extracted material, which lay less than 1 foot below the ground was washed and grade separated on site by a rotary screen. By 1938 a rail tramway had been built to transport the excavated material to the main road - the line ran southwards from the midpoint of the B1445 between Welwick and Patrington, passing west of Haverfield House, to Oxlands Hill, and used a diesel shunting locomotive capable of hauling 120 tons; the material was transported in short wheelbase <b>side</b> <b>tipping</b> wagons.|$|R
5000|$|In 1875 Hudson {{patented}} the [...] "triple centre" [...] <b>side</b> <b>tipping</b> truck. This {{truck is}} of triangular section and has support frames {{at each end}} with three pivot points. The centre pivot being the normal rest position whilst the two outer pivots being used for tipping left or right. This arrangement allows the contents to be easily removed by one man without overturning the truck. Another innovation that Hudson introduced {{was the use of}} hydraulic machinery to form pressed steel components. The use of corrugation as part of the pressing process also helped to provide a strong body with thinner gauge steel. This combination provided a competitive advantage that contributed to Hudson's success.|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to assess the}} tractor-hiring unit of Edo state, Nigeria. The criteria used were fleet of equipment, personnel and workshop facilities {{and its impact on}} the farming populace in the state. The study adopted the use of a questionnaire and interview schedules. Among the information requested from the respondents were access to services rendered by the unit and increment in farm sizes. Records available at the headquarters and zonal offices of the unit provided additional sources of information. The unit has seven Steyr, 18 Fiat and nine Massey Ferguson tractors, eight ploughs, 17 harrows, seven <b>tipping</b> <b>trailers,</b> two boom sprayers, one fertilizer spreader, three maize shellers, two rotary slashers, one drilling machine, two ridgers and a pick-up van which are located in the various zones of the unit. Most of these equipment are either functional or require minor repairs to be used on the field. There is sufficient number of tractors but insufficient implements to fully utilize them. Workshop facilities and personnel are inadequate. The maintenance culture adopted is customer motivated. This is not a good practice as it has resulted in about 12 % of the equipment being abandoned as scraps. There has been a general increase in farmsizes since th...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA wavelet-based {{conditional}} analysis of unsteady flow and sound signals highlights {{the role of}} intermittent perturbations both in the sound generation and the unsteady field of an aerofoil tip leakage flow experiment. It is shown how the most probable flow perturbations generated at the pressure <b>side</b> <b>tip</b> edge are convected through the gap and swept downstream along the suction side past the trailing edge tip corner, where they radiate sound. The nascent sound sources are identified and localized in the clearance between 40 % and 60 % of the chord. It is {{also found that the}} time dependence of the averaged intermittent structures scales with the inverse of the square root of the mean velocity and a physical interpretation based on a simple potential vortex model is proposed. The data are retrieved from an experiment that has been carried out at low Mach number (Ma < 0. 3) in an anechoic test facility. A single motionless instrumented NACA 5510 aerofoil was mounted into the potential core of an open rectangular jet between two plates with an adjustable clearance. The tip leakage flow was ensured by the 5 % camber and a 15 ° angle of attack. A large database obtained by a variety of measurement techniques is thus available for the present analysis. More specifically, the conditional approach is applied to joint far field, wall pressure and particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements. The wall pressure probes are located along the suction <b>side</b> <b>tip</b> edge and on the tip inside the gap, whereas the PIV plane is parallel to the mid-gap plane. Additional joint wall pressure and single hot-wire anemometry (HWA) measurements are also analysed with a hot-wire probe located near the trailing edge tip corner. The conditional averaging is triggered by high-energy wavelet events selected in a reference signal by setting a threshold to the so-called local intermittency measure...|$|R
