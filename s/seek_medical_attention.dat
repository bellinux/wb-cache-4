5|$|Many of the {{symptoms}} of lung cancer (poor appetite, weight loss, fever, fatigue) are not specific. In many people, the cancer has already spread beyond the original site {{by the time they}} have symptoms and <b>seek</b> <b>medical</b> <b>attention.</b> Symptoms that suggest the presence of metastatic disease include weight loss, bone pain and neurological symptoms (headaches, fainting, convulsions, or limb weakness). Common sites of spread include the brain, bone, adrenal glands, opposite lung, liver, pericardium, and kidneys. About 10% of people with lung cancer do not have symptoms at diagnosis; these cancers are incidentally found on routine chest radiography.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Edward William Purvis (July 4, 1857 – August 16, 1888) was a British {{army officer}} and settler of the Kingdom of Hawaii {{who served as}} Vice-Chamberlain {{during the reign of}} King Kalākaua. After resigning from the royal household, Purvis {{published}} two political satires aimed at undermining the image of the king and his prime minister, Walter M. Gibson, who had been responsible for the removal of Purvis' superior. These actions and other factors led to the demise of the Gibson regime and the Bayonet Constitution of 1887. Purvis died in the following year, after going to the United States to <b>seek</b> <b>medical</b> <b>attention</b> for his health. According to popular legend, he was an expert player of the Portuguese machete or cavaquinho and was believed to be the inspiration for the name of the Hawaiian ukulele.|$|E
5|$|Clinical data alone may be {{sufficient}} for {{a diagnosis of}} MS if an individual has had separate episodes of neurological symptoms characteristic of the disease. In those who <b>seek</b> <b>medical</b> <b>attention</b> after only one attack, other testing is needed for the diagnosis. The most commonly used diagnostic tools are neuroimaging, analysis of cerebrospinal fluid and evoked potentials. Magnetic resonance imaging {{of the brain and}} spine may show areas of demyelination (lesions or plaques). Gadolinium can be administered intravenously as a contrast agent to highlight active plaques and, by elimination, demonstrate the existence of historical lesions not associated with symptoms at the moment of the evaluation. Testing of cerebrospinal fluid obtained from a lumbar puncture can provide evidence of chronic inflammation in the central nervous system. The cerebrospinal fluid is tested for oligoclonal bands of IgG on electrophoresis, which are inflammation markers found in 75–85% of people with MS. The nervous system in MS may respond less actively to stimulation of the optic nerve and sensory nerves due to demyelination of such pathways. These brain responses can be examined using visual- and sensory-evoked potentials.|$|E

5|$|The {{result of}} the lack of medical {{information}} on WSW is that medical professionals and some lesbians perceive lesbians as having lower risks of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases or types of cancer. When women do <b>seek</b> <b>medical</b> <b>attention,</b> medical professionals often fail to take a complete medical history. In a recent study of 2,345 lesbian and bisexual women, only 9.3% had claimed they had ever been asked their sexual orientation by a physician. A third of the respondents believed disclosing their sexual history would result in a negative reaction, and 30% had received a negative reaction from a medical professional after identifying themselves as lesbian or bisexual. A patient's complete history helps medical professionals identify higher risk areas and corrects assumptions about the personal histories of women. In a similar survey of 6,935 lesbians, 77% had had sexual contact with one or more male partners, and 6% had that contact within the previous year.|$|E
5|$|Hensley {{was arrested}} in Tennessee on moonshine-related charges during the Prohibition era and sentenced to a term in a workhouse, from which he escaped and fled the state. Hensley {{traveled}} to Ohio, where he held revival services, though {{he and his family}} rarely stayed long in one location. He established churches, known as the Church of God with Signs Following, in Tennessee and Kentucky. His services ranged from small meetings held in houses to large gatherings that drew media attention and hundreds of attendees. Although he conducted many services, he made little money, and he was arrested for violating laws against snake handling at least twice. During his ministry, Hensley claimed to have been bitten by many snakes without ill effect, and {{toward the end of his}} career, he estimated that he had survived more than 400bites. In 1955, while conducting a service in Florida, he was bitten by a snake and became violently ill. He refused to <b>seek</b> <b>medical</b> <b>attention</b> and died the following day. Despite his personal failings, he convinced many residents of rural Appalachia that snake handling was commanded by God, and his followers continued the practice after his death. Although snake handling developed independently in several Pentecostal ministries, Hensley is generally credited with spreading the custom in the Southeastern United States.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} mobilization, the Life Guards arrived at their {{assigned}} position near the Belgian border. Strachwitz and his platoon volunteered for a mounted, long-distance reconnaissance patrol, which would penetrate far behind Belgian lines. His orders were to gather intelligence on rail and communications connections and potentially disturb them, {{as well as}} report on the war preparations being made by their opponents. If the situation allowed, he was to destroy railway and telephone connections and to derail trains, causing as much havoc as possible. His patrol ran into many obstacles and they were constantly {{on the verge of}} being detected by either British or French forces. Their objective was the Paris–Limoges–Bordeaux train track. Strachwitz dispatched a messenger, who broke through to the German lines and delivered the intelligence they had gathered. The patrol blew up the signal box at the Fontainebleau railway station, and tried to force their way through to presumed German troops at the Marne near Châlons. However, the French forces were too strong and they were unable to get through. After six weeks behind the lines their rations were depleted and they had to resort to stealing or begging. Strachwitz then decided to head for Switzerland, hoping that the French–Swiss border was not as heavily protected. After a brief skirmish with French forces, one of Strachwitz's men was seriously wounded, which forced them to <b>seek</b> <b>medical</b> <b>attention.</b> During many weeks of outdoor living their uniforms had deteriorated, so Strachwitz took that opportunity to buy new clothes for his men. Their progress was slowed by the wounded man, and the group was caught in civilian clothes by French forces.|$|E

Often affected ancestors are unknown {{due to the lack of}} information regarding those individuals or about the disease at the time they lived. Other ancestors might be undiagnosed due to the incomplete penetrance or variable expressivity.|$|R

25|$|This species stings in {{response}} to being stepped on or grabbed, but generally avoids conflict. It is also defensive of its hive and can be aggressive around food sources. European hornets are carnivorous and hunt large insects such as beetles, wasps, large moths, dragonflies and mantises. However, mutual predation between medium-sized hornets and robberfly (Asilidae) is often reported. Care should be taken when they are encountered in these circumstances, as they may sting without warning. The pain from the sting may persist for several days with attendant swelling. Victims may wish to <b>seek</b> <b>medical</b> <b>attention</b> {{in case of an}} allergic reaction.|$|E

25|$|If stung, {{the site}} will appear red and may remain itchy and swollen for many days.
