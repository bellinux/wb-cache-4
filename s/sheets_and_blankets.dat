From 12 December the regiment was working to extend a sangar and enjoyed fresh meat, bread, vegetables, and rum. On 17 December bivouac <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> <b>blankets</b> arrived. The weather continued cold and showery, but the good rations and extra blankets and bivouac shelters lifted morale.|$|E

50|$|A {{fitted sheet}} {{goes over the}} mattress. Often a draw sheet, also called lift sheet, is used, where it is placed over the fitted <b>sheet</b> <b>and</b> in the center {{where it will be}} under the patient’s midsection. By lifting the draw sheet, it is used to help move the patient. The fitted <b>sheet</b> <b>and</b> draw <b>sheet,</b> which are those that go under the patient, are firmly tucked in to prevent wrinkles, which can promote skin breakdown. A top <b>sheet</b> <b>and</b> <b>blanket</b> are often placed over the bed and the corners are mitered.|$|R
40|$|The Thuli Basin (Fig. 1) has a {{mean annual runoff}} of 7. 91 mm/a and a {{coefficient}} of variation of 138 % (1950 -present; Chibi et al., 2005). The river rises {{in the hills of}} the Matopos National Park and flows south through communal lands (smallholder farming) to its confluence with the Shashe River. The Thuli river provides around one third of the mean annual runoff of the Shashe Basin (total: 24. 33 mm/a; Görgens and Boroto, 1997). The Shashe river is a left-bank tributary of the Limpopo river. The Thuli river is sub-perennial in its upper reaches (above Thuli-Makwe) and ephemeral in its lower reaches. Below Thuli-Moswa, there are extensive alluvial aquifers. The yield of these aquifers has not yet been documented, but similar aquifers in the adjacent Mzingwane Basin have been estimated to hold more than 38 Mm 3 of water (Moyce et al., in press). Smaller alluvial aquifers underlie many of the tributaries of the lower Thuli river. The Thuli river is dammed at Thuli-Makwe (to supply irrigation water) and additional sites have been identified at Thuli-Elliot and Thuli-Moswa. The Mchabezi river (the principal left-bank tributary) is dammed at Mchabezi, <b>Sheet</b> <b>and</b> <b>Blanket.</b> Mchabezi Dam will augment the water supply for the City of Bulawayo, once a connecting pipeline has been completed. <b>Sheet</b> <b>and</b> <b>Blanket</b> Dams supply water to the City of Gwanda <b>and</b> <b>Blanket</b> <b>and</b> Vubachikwe Mines.

60|$|She {{had been}} {{collecting}} <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> <b>blankets</b> from a press, and hastened to gather them up, and to reply, 'Yes, Jeremiah.' Arthur Clennam helped her by carrying the load himself, wished {{the old man}} good night, and went up-stairs {{with her to the}} top of the house.|$|E
60|$|In a {{few minutes}} she returned, bearing blankets, sheets, and a pillow-case. With Mrs. Aleshine {{on one side of}} the {{bedstead}} and Mrs. Lecks on the other, the <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> <b>blankets</b> were laid with surprising deftness and rapidity, and in a few moments I saw before me a most inviting bed.|$|E
60|$|Sheen {{kept his}} head. In a quiet, {{pleasant}} voice, fingering the swagger-stick, as he spoke, in an absent manner, he requested his young friend to re-make the bed--rapidly and completely.

60|$|Laidlaw quickly {{returned}} {{with a couple of}} <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> a <b>blanket.</b> Sam knotted the sheets together in sailor-like fashion, while his friend made a secure bundle of old Liz with the blanket. Sam was lowered first to the roof of the tenement which we have said was already on fire, and stood ready to receive Liz. She was safely let down and the sheet-rope was detached.|$|R
60|$|She {{forced herself}} to the petty duties of the day, made up the fire from the pile he had left for her, set water to boil, put the hut in order, brought out <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> <b>blankets</b> to air and set herself to wash up.

6000|$|... "Out of doors! What a {{wonderful}} idea!" [...] In {{the end they}} decided {{to sleep on the}} towers--Mary on the western tower, Ivor on the eastern. There was a flat expanse of leads on each of the towers, and you could get a mattress through the trap doors that opened on to them. Under the stars, under the gibbous moon, assuredly they would sleep. The mattresses were hauled up, <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> <b>blankets</b> were spread, and an hour later the two insomniasts, each on his separate tower, were crying their good-nights across the dividing gulf.|$|E
60|$|There was a bath in that corner, {{from which}} the water had been hastily drained off. Lying in it, as in a grave or sarcophagus, with a hurried drapery of <b>sheet</b> <b>and</b> <b>blanket</b> thrown across it, was {{the body of a}} heavily-made man, with an obtuse head, and coarse, mean, common features. A sky-light had been opened to release the steam with which the room had been filled; but it hung, {{condensed}} into water-drops, heavily upon the walls, and heavily upon the face and figure in the bath. The room was still hot, and the marble of the bath still warm; but the face and figure were clammy to the touch. The white marble {{at the bottom of the}} bath was veined with a dreadful red. On the ledge at the side, were an empty laudanum-bottle and a tortoise-shell handled penknife--soiled, but not with ink.|$|R

60|$|Not so thought Jake the Flint. Despair did {{not seem}} to be a {{possibility}} to him. Accordingly, he examined his prison carefully, and with a hopeful smile. The examination was soon completed, for the room presented no facilities whatever for escape. There was no bed from which to take the <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> <b>blankets</b> to extemporise a rope. No mattress to throw over the window so as to break a heavy man's fall. No chimney by which to ascend to the roof, no furniture, indeed, of any kind beyond a deal chair and table. The door was of solid oak and bolted outside.|$|E

I wish to know why haste was made to stick those pins all over his innocent form, in every direction? I wish to be informed why light and air are excluded from Augustus George, like poisons? Why, I ask, is my unoffending infant so hedged into a basket-bedstead, with dimity and calico, with miniature <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> <b>blankets,</b> that I can only hear him snuffle (and no wonder!) deep down under the pink hood of a little bathing-machine, and can never peruse even so much of his lineaments as his nose? ...|$|E
60|$|What {{surprised}} me was, that Dr. John (so the young Englishman had taught Fifine to call him, {{and we all}} took from her the habit of addressing him by this name, till it became an established custom, and he was known by no other in the Rue Fossette)--that Dr. John consented tacitly to adopt Madame's tactics, and to fall in with her manoeuvres. He betrayed, indeed, a period of comic doubt, cast one or two rapid glances from the child to the mother, indulged in an interval of self-consultation, but finally resigned himself with a good grace to play his part in the farce. Désirée eat like a raven, gambolled day and night in her bed, pitched tents with the <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> <b>blankets,</b> lounged like a Turk amidst pillows and bolsters, diverted herself with throwing her shoes at her bonne and grimacing at her sisters--over-flowed, in short, with unmerited health and evil spirits; only languishing when her mamma and the physician paid their diurnal visit. Madame Beck, I knew, was glad, at any price, to have her daughter in bed {{out of the way}} of mischief; but I wondered that Dr. John did not tire of the business.|$|E
60|$|Sheppard was now {{upon his}} wicked Range in London, {{committing}} Robberies every where at Discretion; but one Day {{meeting with his}} Acquaintance, James Sykes, alias Hell and Fury, sometimes a Chair-man, and at others a Running Foot-man. This Sykes invited {{him to go to}} one Redgate's, a Victualling-house near the Seven Dials, to play at Skettles, Sheppard comply'd, and Sykes secretly sent for Mr. Price a Constable in St. Giles's Parish, and Charg'd him with his Friend Sheppard for the Robbing of Mrs. Cook, &c. Sheppard was carried before Justice Parry, who order'd him to St. Giles's Round-house till the next Morning for farther Examination: He was Confin'd in the Upper part of the Place, being two Stories from the Ground, but 'ere two Hours came about, by only the help of a Razor, and the Stretcher of a Chair, he broke open the Top of the Round house, and tying together a <b>Sheet</b> <b>and</b> <b>Blanket,</b> by them descended into the Church-yard and Escap'd, leaving the Parish to Repair the Damage, and Repent of the Affront put upon his Skill and Capacity.|$|R
50|$|After lunch, the {{children}} would line up once again inside the building, pick up their bed rolls which consisted of a pillow, a <b>sheet</b> <b>and</b> an army-type <b>blanket.</b> There were cots set up near each classroom and {{the children}} would take their bedrolls to the cots for an afternoon nap of two hours.|$|R

60|$|Macbeth and Sancho {{have been}} equally eloquent in the praise of sleep. 'Sleep that knits up the ravelled sleave of care!' But sleep will knit up effectually no broken {{stitches}} unless it be enjoyed in bed. 'Blessings on him who invented sleep,' said Sancho. But the great inventor {{was he who}} discovered mattresses and <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> <b>blankets.</b> These two unfortunates no doubt slept; but in the morning they were weary, comfortless, and exhausted. Towels and basins were brought to them, and then they prepared themselves to watch through another day. It {{seemed to be a}} trial between them, which could outwatch the other. The mother was, of course, much the older; but with poor Hester there was the baby to add to her troubles. Never was there a woman more determined to carry out her purpose than Mrs. Bolton, or one more determined to thwart the purpose of another than she who still called herself Hester Caldigate. In the morning Mrs. Bolton implored her husband to go into Cambridge as usual; but he felt that he could not leave the house with such inmates. So he sat in his bedroom dozing wretchedly in his arm-chair.|$|E

"Why, {{get out on}} {{the roof}} to be sure," [...] (Mrs Denman shivered) [...] "and get along the tiles to the next house," [...] (Mrs Denman shut her eyes and shuddered) [...] "an' so make yer escape. Then you should have a ladder fixed to this trap-door so as it couldn't be took away, and ye should have some dozen fathoms o' {{half-inch}} rope always handy, cause if ye was cut off from the staircase by fire an' from the roof by smoke ye might have to let yourself down from a windy. It's as well, too, to know how to knot <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> <b>blankets</b> together, so that the ties won't slip, for if you have no rope they'd be better than nothin'.

60|$|Even in that squalid {{street where}} she lived, {{those who knew}} Fan from {{living in the same}} house, or in one of those {{immediately}} adjoining it, considered it a disgraceful thing for her parents to send her out begging; for that was what they called it, although the begging was made lawful by the match-selling pretext. To them it was a very flimsy one, since the cost of a dozen such boxes at any oil-shop in the Edgware Road was twopence-three-farthings--eleven farthings for twelve boxes of safety matches! The London poor {{know how hard it is}} to live and pay their weekly rent, and are accustomed to make every allowance for each other; and those who sat in judgment on the Harrods--Fan's parents--were mostly people who were glad to make a shilling by almost any means; glad also, many of them, to get drunk occasionally when the state of the finances allowed it; also they regarded it as the natural and right thing to do to repair regularly every Monday morning to the pawnbroker's shop to pledge the Sunday shoes and children's frocks, with perhaps a tool or two or a pair of <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> <b>blankets</b> not too dirty and ragged to tempt the cautious gentleman with the big nose.|$|E

60|$|On the north, the Calton Hill {{is neither}} so abrupt in itself nor has it so {{exceptional}} an outlook; and yet even here it commands a striking prospect. A gully separates {{it from the}} New Town. This is Greenside, where witches were burned and tournaments held in former days. Down that almost precipitous bank, Bothwell launched his horse, and so first, as they say, attracted the bright eyes of Mary. It is now tesselated with <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> <b>blankets</b> out to dry, {{and the sound of}} people beating carpets is rarely absent. Beyond all this, the suburbs run out to Leith; Leith camps on the seaside with her forest of masts; Leith roads are full of ships at anchor; the sun picks out the white pharos upon Inchkeith Island; the Firth extends on either hand from the Ferry to the May; the towns of Fifeshire sit, each in its bank of blowing smoke, along the opposite coast; and the hills enclose the view, except to the farthest east, where the haze of the horizon rests upon the open sea. There lies the road to Norway: a dear road for Sir Patrick Spens and his Scots Lords; and yonder smoke on the hither side of Largo Law is Aberdour, from whence they sailed to seek a queen for Scotland.|$|E
60|$|The {{performances}} at the Paphian Hall on that festive occasion {{need not be}} described here with accuracy. The New Year had been seen well in with music, dancing, and wine. The seeing of it in was continued yet for an hour, till an indulgent policeman was forced to interfere. It is believed that on the final ejection of our two friends, the forlorn lover, kept steady, no doubt, {{by the weight of}} his woe, did find his way home to his own lodgings. The exultant Crocker was less fortunate, and passed his night without the accommodation of <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> <b>blankets</b> somewhere in the neighbourhood of Bow Street. The fact is important to us, as it threatened to have considerable effect upon our friend's position at his office. Having been locked up in a cell during the night, and kept in durance till he was brought on the following morning before a magistrate, he could not well be in his room at ten o'clock. Indeed when he did escape from the hands of the Philistines, at about two in the day, sick, unwashed and unfed, he thought it better to remain away altogether for that day. The great sin of total absence would be better than making an appearance before Mr. Jerningham in his present tell-tale condition. He well knew his own strength and his own weakness. All power of repartee would be gone from him for the day. Mr. Jerningham would domineer over him, and Æolus, should the violent god be pleased to send for him, would at once annihilate him. So he sneaked home to Gower Street, took a hair of the dog that bit him, and then got the old woman who looked after him to make him some tea and to fry a bit of bacon for him. In this ignominious way he passed New Year's Day,--at least so much of it as was left to him after the occurrences which have been described.|$|E
6000|$|In 1879 he {{was acting}} with a strolling company, and came to Amherst, in Nova Scotia. Here he heard of a haunted house, known to the local {{newspapers}} as [...] "The Great Amherst Mystery". Having previously succeeded in exposing the frauds of spiritualism Mr. Hubbell determined to investigate the affair of Amherst. The haunted house was inhabited by Daniel Teed, the respected foreman in a large shoe factory. Under his roof were Mrs. Teed, [...] "as good a woman as ever lived"; little Willie, a baby boy; and Mrs. Teed's two sisters, Jennie, a very pretty girl, and Esther, remarkable for large grey eyes, pretty little hands and feet, and candour of expression. A brother of Teed's and a brother of Mrs. Cox made up the family. They were well off, and lived comfortably in a detached cottage of two storys. It began when Jennie and Esther were in bed one night. Esther jumped up, saying {{that there was a}} mouse in the bed. Next night, a green band-box began to make a rustling noise, and then rose a foot in the air, several times. On the following night Esther felt unwell, and [...] "was a swelling wisibly before the werry eyes" [...] of her alarmed family. Reports like thunder peeled through her chamber, under a serene sky. Next day Esther could only eat [...] "a small piece of bread and butter, and a large green pickle". She recovered slightly, in spite of the pickle, but, four nights later, all her and her sister's bed-clothes flew off, and settled down in a remote corner. At Jennie's screams, the family rushed in, and found Esther [...] "fearfully swollen". Mrs. Teed replaced the bed-clothes, which flew off again, the pillow striking John Teed in the face. Mr. Teed then left the room, observing, in a somewhat unscientific spirit, that [...] "he had had enough of it". The others, with a kindness which did them credit, sat on the edges of the bed, and repressed the desire of the <b>sheets</b> <b>and</b> <b>blankets</b> to fly away. The bed, however, sent forth peels like thunder, when Esther suddenly fell into a peaceful sleep.|$|E

If the extra 2d. is forthcoming the wanderer is provided with a proper bed, fitted with a wire spring hospital frame and provided with a mattress, <b>sheets,</b> pillow, <b>and</b> <b>blankets.</b> I may state here that {{as in the case of}} this Shelter the building, furniture and other equipment have been provided by charity, the nightly fees collected almost suffice to pay the running expenses of the establishment. Under less favourable circumstances, however, where the building and equipment are a charge on the capital funds of the Salvation Army, the experience is that these fees do not suffice to meet the cost of interest and maintenance.|$|R
