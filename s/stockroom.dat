5|$|Although {{there have}} been {{persistent}} claims of betrayal by an informant, {{the source of the}} information that led the authorities to raid the Achterhuis has never been identified. Night watchman Martin Sleegers and an unidentified police officer investigated a burglary at the premises in April 1944 and came across the bookcase concealing the secret door. Tonny Ahlers, a member of the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands (NSB), was suspected of being the informant by Carol Ann Lee, biographer of Otto Frank. Another suspect is <b>stockroom</b> manager Willem van Maaren. The Annex occupants did not trust him, as he seemed inquisitive regarding people entering the <b>stockroom</b> after hours. He once unexpectedly asked the employees whether there had previously been a Mr. Frank at the office. Lena Hartog was suspected of being the informant by Anne Frank's biographer Melissa Müller. Several of these suspects knew one another and might have worked in collaboration. While virtually everyone connected with the betrayal was interrogated after the war, no one was definitively identified as being the informant.|$|E

The nurse has it out for him, and when Ivan sees Neto faking to take a pill, he injects the drug through a syringe. That night, Neto, after doping a nurse, goes to the hospital <b>stockroom</b> and asks the inmate Biu to set fire to a stack of drugs. When Ivan discovers this, Neto receives solitary confinement. After being released from solitary, Neto writes {{a letter to his}} father and silently gives it to him when he visits. After refusing to have his hair cut, Neto is locked in solitary once again. He sets fires to the cage and is rescued by the nurses. After reading the letter, Wilson takes him from the clinic.

2500|$|A {{detailed}} conceptual {{proposal for}} a physical non-biological self-replicating system was first put forward by mathematician John von Neumann in lectures delivered in 1948 and 1949, when he proposed a kinematic self-reproducing automaton model as a thought experiment. Von Neumann's concept of a physical self-replicating machine was dealt with only abstractly, with the hypothetical machine using a [...] "sea" [...] or <b>stockroom</b> of spare parts as its source of raw materials. The machine had a program stored on a memory tape that directed it to retrieve parts from this [...] "sea" [...] using a manipulator, assemble them into a duplicate of itself, and then copy the contents of its memory tape into the empty duplicate's. The machine was envisioned as consisting of as few as eight different types of components; four logic elements that send and receive stimuli and four mechanical elements used to provide a structural skeleton and mobility. While qualitatively sound, von Neumann was evidently dissatisfied with this model of a self-replicating machine due {{to the difficulty of}} analyzing it with mathematical rigor. He went on to instead develop an even more abstract model self-replicator based on cellular automata. His original kinematic concept remained obscure until it was popularized in a 1955 issue of Scientific American.|$|E

Soon the work-girls went trooping past, making remarks. It was the commoner girls who worked upstairs at the heavy tasks of truss-making and the finishing of artificial limbs.

50|$|In 1972, the {{components}} of Pogue's end-game would start to take shape when ADG purchased L.S. Ayres (13 stores) and Stewart Dry Goods (7 stores) based in nearby Indianapolis and Louisville, respectively. Unlike the other ADG regional carriage trade chains, L.S.

ADG now had a 25-store cluster of stores across the Indiana, Ohio, and Kentucky tristate, and cost synergies between the three, while operating independently, began to be implemented. As {{one of the two}} smallest chains within ADG, Pogue's was often the test ground for new CEO's and a parade of young store leaders on two to three year rotations would become commonplace in the Executive Office, unsettling to staff who had worked for up to five generations of Pogue family members who would famously roll up their sleeves and wade into the <b>stockrooms</b> and sales floors when peak business demanded it.

40|$|Metastasis is {{the leading}} cause of cancer death, yet it is {{mechanistically}} considered a very inefficient process suggesting the presence of some sort of (e. g. systemic) routes for fuelling the process. The pre-metastatic niche formation is described as one such metastasis promoting route. Now, the emerging potentials of tumor-derived microvesicles (TDMVs), not only in formulating the pre-metastatic niche, but also conferring neoplastic phenotypes onto normal cells, has integrated new concepts into the field. Here, we note as an ancillary proposition that, exerting functional disturbances in other sites, TDMVs (we have termed them metastasomes) may aid foundation of the secondary lesions via two seemingly interrelated models: (i) tumor-organ-training (TOTr), training a proper niche for the growth of the disseminated tumor cells; (ii) tumor-organ-targeting (TOTa), contribution to the propagation of the transformed phenotype via direct or indirect (TOTr-mediated disturbed stroma) transformation and/or heightened growth/survival states of the normal resident cells in the secondary organs. Respecting the high content of the RNA molecules (particularly microRNAs) identified in the secretory MVs, they may play crucial parts in such "malignant trait" spreading system. That is, the interactions between tumor tissue-specific RNA signatures, being transferred via metastasomes, and the cell-type/tissue-specific RNA <b>stockrooms</b> in other areas may settle a unique outcome in each organ. Thus, serving as tumor-organ matchmakers, the RNA molecules may also play substantial roles in the seeding and tropism of the process. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} the {{investigation}} is a rack stacker-crane (RSC) attending a rack section storing {{a wide range of}} cargoes. The purpose is to determine how the cargoes should be arranged in rack in order to increase the capacity of the stacker-crane. The carried out analysis of the duration of the working cycle phases of the RSC has revealed that a considerable portion of the operation of the RSC is spent on the motion between the areas of storing the cargoes of various types. A principle of forming zones for storing the cargoes of various kinds has been suggested to permit decreasing the distance between the above storage zones. A comparative analysis of the known methods of solving the zoning problem has been made, and a new zoning problem solution method considering the peculiar features of a volume-planning solution of the storage section, the speed characteristics of the RSC and the frequency characteristics of the cargoes has been suggested, the method being 10 to 15 % more efficient than the known methods. A system of criteria used for estimating the operating capacity of the RSC has been proposed. A required minimum of data required for the rack-RSC model has been revealed, and information structures completely describing all the components of the modeled system have been created. An algorithm has been developed, and a simulation model which permits to study and find the solutions to the zoning problems both for the operating rack warehouses and for choosing the components of the warehouse at a design stage have been program-implemented. The results of the study are recommended to be used at the plants having automated multi-range <b>stockrooms.</b> Available from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
