40|$|Although it {{is widely}} {{believed}} that silica solubility in low pressure (5 to 10 bar) geothermal steam is negligible, when one takes into account steam flows exceeding 10 million tonnes a year [...] at Wairakei, for instance [...] it is found that the amount transmitted in the vapor has the potential to give significant deposits on turbine nozzles and blades. A 150 MWe power station, when based on flows from a hot water reservoir at (a) 250 C or (b) 315 C, and with separator pressures of 6 bar, is found to carry about 100 and 200 kg/year respectively in the steam phase. In the case of a similar sized station exploiting a dry steam reservoir such as The Geysers, equivalent silica flows are obtained, dissolved in steam and carried as dust [...] the latter as solid particles precipitating from the vapor en route from source to turbine, and not preexisting in the formations as is commonly considered. Choking or coating of subterranean rock near such dry steam wells due to exsolving silica, may be the principal cause of declining steam discharge under production. Silica from completely dry or superheated steam can also <b>seal</b> <b>the</b> <b>cap</b> and sides of steam reservoirs when expanding below the criticus temperature (236 C) in a way previously thought possible only by hot water or wet steam...|$|E

The bore wells were pumped for some time before collecting water samples so as to eliminate the residual water in the casing tube of the well and to obtain fresh water directly from the aquifer. Dry, clean and sterilized plastic bottles were used to get fresh aquifer water for sampling.

40|$|Carbon {{capture and}} storage in deep {{geological}} formations {{is a method}} to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Supercritical CO 2 is injected into a reservoir and dissolves in the brine. Under the impact of pressure and temperature (P–T) the aqueous species of the CO 2 -acidified brine diffuse through <b>the</b> <b>cap</b> rock where they trigger CO 2 –water–rock interactions. These geochemical reactions result in mineral dissolution and precipitation along the CO 2 migration path and are responsible {{for a change in}} porosity and therefore for <b>the</b> <b>sealing</b> capacity of <b>the</b> <b>cap</b> rock. This study focuses on the diffusive mass transport of CO 2 along a gradient of decreasing P–T conditions. The process is retraced with a one-dimensional hydrogeochemical reactive mass transport model. The semi-generic hydrogeochemical model is based on chemical equilibrium thermodynamics. Based on a broad variety of scenarios, including different initial mineralogical, chemical and physical parameters, the hydrogeochemical parameters that are most sensitive for safe long-term CO 2 storage are identified. The results demonstrate that P–T conditions have the strongest effect on the change in porosity and the effect of both is stronger at high P–T conditions because the solubility of the mineral phases involved depends on P–T conditions. Furthermore, modeling results indicate that the change in porosity depends strongly on the initial mineralogical composition of <b>the</b> reservoir and <b>cap</b> rock {{as well as on the}} brine compositions.

40|$|The petrophysical {{properties}} of cap rocks and intraformational barriers can constrain {{the carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) containment volumes of potential geosequestration sites. Characterisation of regional seals and intraformational barriers requires an understanding of <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> capacity of <b>the</b> <b>cap</b> rock or barrier. <b>Seal</b> capacity is <b>the</b> capillary pressure (or column height) at which a trapped fl uid commences to leak through a seal rock. Seal rocks are effective due to very fi ne pore and pore-throat sizes that result in low porosities and permeabilities. These in turn generate high capillary threshold pressures. High threshold pressures, together with wettability and interfacial tension (IFT) properties determine the fi nal column height that a seal can hold. Wettability and IFT {{play an important role}} in the geological storage of CO 2 through their effect on seal capacity (CO 2 column height) with respect to capillary pressure, thereby controlling the potential for the movement of CO 2 through <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> and affecting ultimate reservoir storage volumes. Mercury injection capillary pressure analysis has been used extensively in the petroleum industry to determine the effectiveness of <b>the</b> top <b>seal</b> in relation to hydrocarbon column height retention. With the burgeoning interest in geological storage of CO 2, this technology can be applied to establish the suitability of a top seal for containment of CO 2; however, the role of IFT and wettability in the CO 2 -water-rock systems is not well understood. It is unclear how supercritical CO 2 (scCO 2) affects these two properties, particularly as the water front becomes saturated with scCO 2 and eventually becomes miscible with the scCO 2 at high pressure reservoir conditions. Selected examples of top and intraformational <b>seals</b> from <b>the</b> Bowen, Otway, Gippsland and Cooper basins are discussed in light of new experimental evidence on wettability and IFT variations in the CO 2 -water-rock system.
