5|$|By {{the end of}} this period, the {{constant}} attempts at reorganisation had proved a mixed bag, particularly for the auxiliary forces. The Militia was heavily understrength and disorganised, whilst the number of recruits for the Volunteers was falling off and the financial situation of the units was becoming worrying. The system of central per-capita grants helped support the units, despite the worrying side-effect of causing an incentive to keep as many men on the books as possible regardless of fitness, but even so it was becoming apparent that many Volunteer Corps were headed towards financial collapse unless <b>some</b> <b>action</b> were taken.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} 15 {{games of the}} 2013–14 NBA season, Nelson started at point guard for the Orlando Magic, but on November 29, he missed the game due to injury. Victor Oladipo moved from {{shooting}} guard to point guard, while Moore became the starting shooting guard against the San Antonio Spurs. Moore missed <b>some</b> <b>action</b> due to injury with the game against Sacramento on December 21. He returned to the lineup three games later on December 29. On February 18 against the Milwaukee Bucks, Moore had 17 points and 2 blocks, which were season highs. Moore tied his season high of 17 points on 6-for-6 shooting, including 5-for-5 on three point shots on April 9 against the Brooklyn Nets.|$|E
5|$|From 1749 to the 1760s, Fort Chambray {{was built}} on the island of Gozo. It was {{intended}} to be a new fortified city like Valletta, and eventually to replace the Cittadella as the island's capital. This was unsuccessful, and eventually only the fort was built. It saw <b>some</b> <b>action</b> during the French occupation of 1798, but its importance eventually diminished. It was converted into a hospital in the 19th century. In the 1990s, the interior of the fort began to be redeveloped, but the outer bastions and some barracks remain intact.|$|E

Against , he threw 11completions on 15attempts for 129yards. Brown also saw <b>some</b> <b>action</b> in garbage time against Syracuse, Connecticut, and Cincinnati. Pat White was injured before the regular season finale, so Brown started against Rutgers. Brown completed 14of 29passes for 244yards, one touchdown, and one interception. He also made 17rushing attempts for 73yards and one touchdown, and he was sacked twice. Brown threw the game-winning touchdown pass {{to win the game}} in triple overtime.|$|E
5|$|Although ferries (and later bridges) {{had crossed}} the river to the east at Richmond since 1459 and to the west at Eel Pie Island since at least 1652 the lands {{to the south of}} the river at this point had {{historically}} been privately held by the Tollemache family (owners of Ham House) and off limits to the public. Consequently, despite the distance from the nearest crossings there was little demand for cross-river services at this location. Additionally, the Tollemache family had licensing rights for the Twickenham Ferry at Eel Pie Island (sometimes known as Dysart's ferry after the family), and consequently had little interest in promoting a competing service. The Twickenham Ferry is a setting for <b>some</b> <b>action</b> in Little Dorritt by Charles Dickens.|$|E
5|$|The 52nd was {{initially}} a one-battalion regiment, but increased recruiting {{resulted in the}} creation of a second battalion in 1798. While the 1st Battalion saw <b>some</b> <b>action</b> in Spain and Portugal in 1800–1801, the 2nd remained stationed in England. In 1803 the regiment's fittest officers and men were concentrated in the 1st battalion, for training as light infantry, and the 2nd battalion was transferred to the 96th Foot. A new second battalion was raised in 1804. Both battalions saw extensive action during the Napoleonic Wars, and they were brigaded together for a time during the Peninsula Campaign, but heavy losses at Badajoz in 1812 resulted in the reduction of the 2nd battalion to a cadre (skeleton staff). The 2nd was eventually reformed with new recruits and saw service in Holland in 1813–14. Following the conclusion of the war in 1814, both battalions were billeted in England, where the 2nd's effectives were transferred to the 1st battalion, in preparation for further service. The 2/52nd remained in England during the Waterloo Campaign, and were disbanded in 1815. Subsequently, the 52nd remained a one-battalion regiment until their merger with the 43rd.|$|E
