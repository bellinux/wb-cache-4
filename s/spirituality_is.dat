5|$|I {{think it}} is {{important}} that people see that <b>spirituality</b> <b>is</b> at the base of Nonviolent Communication, and that they learn the mechanics of the process with that in mind. It's really a spiritual practice that I am trying to show as a way of life. Even though we don't mention this, people get seduced by the practice. Even if they practice this as a mechanical technique, they start to experience things between themselves and other people they weren't able to experience before. So eventually they come to the spirituality of the process. They begin to see that it's more than a communication process and realize it's really an attempt to manifest a certain spirituality.|$|E

Franciscan prayer recognizes God's presence in the wonder of creation, as expressed in St. Francis' Canticle of the Sun.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the project {{described}} in this document was to examine organizational spirituality {{in an effort to}} contribute to more holistic understandings of organizing. The project involved an interpretive, qualitative, ethnographic study of a women 2 ̆ 7 s religious organization [...] the Aberdeen, South Dakota congregation of the Presentation Sisters of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The question I sought to answer in this project was: What is the relationship among communication, organizational spirituality, and organizational identification? I argue that these three constructs are products and producers of each other. In an effort to give voice to the organizational experiences of women, I approach this project from a feminist perspective. In addition, I utilize critical theory as a frame for understanding activities of critical self-reflection in which the Presentation Sisters are engaged. I understood <b>spirituality</b> to <b>be</b> a path to reach the divine; the Presentation Sisters were found to exhibit a similar understanding. Presentation <b>spirituality</b> <b>was</b> described and nine manifestations of that <b>spirituality</b> <b>were</b> identified: stories; worship; artwork; formal presentations; printed literature; ministry; Chapter directives; the sisters 2 ̆ 7 activities which influence the surrounding community; and, daily lived examples of Presentation spirituality. As these manifestations of <b>spirituality</b> <b>were</b> created and observed, organizational <b>spirituality</b> <b>was</b> created and recreated. The nuanced relationship between communal and individual <b>spirituality</b> <b>was</b> discussed; for the Presentation Sisters, individual and communal <b>spirituality</b> <b>were</b> intimately connected. Finally, I note that organizational spirituality and organizational identification were co-constructed to a large extent for the Presentation Sisters and this co-construction was accomplished through communication. However, this process was complicated in lived organizational life as some of the very things that unify the organization and promote organizational identification also divided the order on certain issues. ...|$|R

Also, stress was expected to differ by year in college and gender. Students (N = 131, Mage = 19. 81, SD = 1. 35) from a mid-Atlantic medium-sized parochial comprehensive university completed several questionnaires; results were analyzed with hierarchical regressions.

25|$|Ignatian Spirituality {{incorporates}} {{elements from}} earlier spiritual traditions: finding God in all things, or being a contemplative in action, has been likened to the spirituality of St. Francis of Assisi whom Ignatius admired. Meditation/contemplation on the Gospels has {{roots in the}} Benedictine Lectio Divina. However, Ignatian <b>Spirituality</b> <b>is</b> adaptable as is clear from Ignatius' book on the Exercises. For instance, Pedro Arrupe (1907-1991), a prominent Superior General of the Jesuits from 1965-1983, was known for incorporating Zen meditative techniques to assist in his concentration. Another example of adaptability {{is the extent to}} which the individual exercitant applies imagination, quite presence, or discursive reasoning to the events of Jesus' life, to arrive at closer knowledge and following of the Lord.|$|E
25|$|Romanian <b>spirituality</b> <b>is</b> greatly {{influenced}} by its strong connections with the Eastern Christian world.

Despite the diminishing importance of the church in recent generations, it remains the most trusted institution in Romania. Church attendance is high in rural communities and among the elders in the cities. Also, despite accusations of collaborationism with the communist regime, which continue to plague the Romanian Church, some clerics such as Dumitru Stăniloae and Richard Wurmbrandt openly protested against political interventions in religious business.
