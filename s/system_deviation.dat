5000|$|Radios in a {{professional}} two-way radio system using CTCSS always transmit their own tone code whenever the transmit button is pressed (the tone is transmitted at a low level simultaneously with the voice). This is called CTCSS encoding. CTCSS continuously superimposes any one of 32, 38 or as many as 50 (depending on which [...] "standard" [...] is used) precise, very low distortion, low-pitched audio tones on the transmitted signal, ranging from 67 to 257 Hz. The tones are usually referred to as sub-audible tones. In an FM two-way radio system, CTCSS encoder levels are usually set for 15% of <b>system</b> <b>deviation.</b> For example, in a 5 kHz deviation system, the CTCSS tone level would normally be set to 750 Hz deviation. Engineered systems may call for different level settings in the 500 Hz to 1 kHz (10-20%) range.|$|E
5000|$|On FM two-way radios, tones {{are usually}} sent {{at a level}} that equals two-thirds of <b>system</b> <b>{{deviation}}.</b> For example, in a ±5 kHz deviation system, the tone encoder is set to produce 3.3 kHz of transmitter deviation, (modulation,) or less. Because the tones are audible, in systems with solid received signals, tone levels are sometimes set lower so that radio users are not forced to listen to them at a high level. Keeping the tone modulation below [...] system maximum preserves the clean sine wave produced by the encoder. Sending digits at higher levels causes the transmitter's circuits that are designed to prevent over-modulation to distort or clip the waveform of the tones. Distorted wave forms may not decode properly or may include harmonics that cause falsing. Tones are usually sent at a minimum of 500 milliseconds (ms) to 3 seconds (3,000 ms) in length.|$|E
