The O- 2 plasma etching {{was introduced to}} manipulate the diameters of the ZnO HNSs. This fabrication method has the advantages of simplicity, large scale production, easy size and shape manipulations, low cost and bio-compatibility. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images show that the obtained Ag NP-ZnO HNS hybrid structures are hexagonally arranged, with the uniform size and shape, and the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern shows that the ZnO HNS arrays are of high crystal quality and have a dominant orientation of direction. Resonant Raman scattering spectra reveal the multiphonon A 1 (LO) modes of ZnO hollow nanospheres at 574, 1147 and 1725 cm(- 1). Enhanced resonant Raman scattering from the Ag NP modified ZnO HNSs was observed, indicating a strong energy coupling effect located at the metal/semiconductor interface. Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) application for the Ag NP decorated ZnO HNS arrays was verified using a Rhodamine 6 G (R 6 G) chromophore as a <b>standard</b> <b>analyte,</b> which is {{proved to be an}} effective SERS template for Raman signal detection. SERS substrates with different structures have been compared, and the Ag NP modified ZnO HNS system exhibits superior Raman scattering enhancements induced by the local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect. The SERS mechanism was well explained by theoretical calculation results. This study is helpful to fabricate controllable Ag NP arrays using the ZnO HNS as the supporting structure and to understand the mechanism of bio-sensing enhancements due to the LSPR effect originated from the metal NPs and metal/semiconductor interface...|$|E

A novel method was developed to measure the substrates and products of 5 α-reductases (testosterone, 5 α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), androstenedione) and finasteride and dutasteride simultaneously by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, using an ABSciex QTRAP® 5500, with a Waters Acquity™ UPLC. Analytes were extracted from serum (500 µL) via solid-phase extraction (Oasis® HLB), with 13 C 3 -labelled androgens and d 9 -finasteride included as internal <b>standards.</b> <b>Analytes</b> were separated on a Kinetex C 18 column (150 × 3 mm, 2. 6 µm), using a gradient run of 19 min. Temporal resolution of analytes from naturally occurring isomers and mass + 2 isotopomers was ensured. Protonated molecular ions were detected in atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation mode and source conditions optimised for DHT, the least abundant analyte. Multiple reaction monitoring was performed as follows: testosterone (m/z 289 → 97), DHT (m/z 291 → 255), androstenedione (m/z 287 → 97), dutasteride (m/z 529 → 461), finasteride (m/z 373 → 317). Validation parameters (intra- and inter-assay precision and accuracy, linearity, limits of quantitation) were within acceptable ranges and biological extracts were stable for 28 days. Finally the method was employed in men treated with finasteride or dutasteride; levels of DHT were lowered by both drugs and furthermore the substrate concentrations increased...|$|R

40|$|A highly {{selective}} and robust method for simultaneous screening and confirmation of target and non-target phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE- 5) inhibitor analogues {{within a single}} chromatographic run in counterfeit herbal products was developed. The protocol, based on an easy and rapid extraction with a water/acetonitrile 1  % formic acid solution, followed by sonication and centrifugation, exploits an LC-diode array detector-quadrupole-time-of-flight (DAD-QTOF) system. The extraction method was optimized both at high concentrations and at trace levels. These two situations are typically encountered in pharmaceutical formulations and herbal food supplements. Carryover effects, never reported before and occurring mainly for vardenafil, were overcome using a polymer-based column. An in-house validation was carried out using five blanks of different bulk matrices spiked with seven <b>standard</b> <b>analytes,</b> namely yohimbine, sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil, homosildenafil, pseudovardenafil and hydroxyhomovardenafil. Reliable quantitation was possible using a conventional standard solution for all the pharmaceutical and herbal samples considered, as matrix effects were eliminated. Accuracy ranged from 80. 9 to 108. 1  % with overall relative standard deviation (RSD) < 11  % (N[*]=[*] 15), measured at 1. 0, 5. 0 and 10. 0  μg/g. Limits of detection (LODs) obtained ensured the determination of cross contaminations at nanogram per gram levels. A database with 82 PDE- 5 inhibitor analogues was implemented for automatic non-target analysis. Among the 26 samples of dietary supplements and herbal remedies bulk marketed for erectile dysfunctions, three samples {{were found to be}} contaminated with both registered and unregistered synthetic PDE- 5 inhibitors, i. e. yohimbine, sildenafil, dimethylsildenafil and thiodimethylsildenafil or thiomethisosildenafil. The occurrence of such contaminations, both at trace levels and at pharmaceutical dosage, indicates the illicit use of synthetic PDE- 5 analogues.

40|$|Magnetic {{mesoporous}} carbon microspheres with a yolk-shell structure (YSMMCS) {{have been}} prepared via a new in situ carbon source strategy. The material was fabricated by two shells coated onto the Fe 3 O 4 particles; the inner dense and thick silica shell could protect the magnetic core from harsh acidic solvents as well as induce the void between the core and the outer shell for the yolk-shell structure, while the outer organosilica shell {{was used as the}} template and carbon source for in situ preparation of a carbon shell with mesoporous structure. A C- 18 -alkyl chain was incorporated in situ as the carbon precursor efficiently, avoiding the conventional infiltration step, which was very difficult to manipulate and time-consuming with the possibility of losing the carbon precursor. The resulting yolk-shell magnetic mesoporous carbon microspheres exhibited a high surface area (273. 15 m(2) g(- 1)), a large pore volume (0. 31 cm(3) g(- 1)), and a strong magnetic response (a saturation magnetization value of 34. 57 emu g(- 1)). As a result of the void between the core and the outer shell and the pi-pi stacking effect, adsorption capacity reached 191. 64 mg g(- 1) by using Rhodamine B as a <b>standard</b> <b>analyte,</b> indicating the great potential application of the material as drug carriers. Owing to the inherent hydrophobicity and high surface area, the composite material showed better performance in the enrichment of peptides than a magnetic mesoporous silica material (Fe 2 O 3 @nSiO(2) @mSiO(2)). According to the LC-MS/MS results, about 51 and 29 nonredundant peptides were identified from tryptic digests of 5 nM BSA. Additionally, taking advantage of the mesoporous structure and strong magnetic response, the material was utilized to selectively extract low abundance endogenous peptides from human serum in the presence of high abundance proteins. Based on the LC-MS/MS results, 962 endogenous peptides were obtained by 2. 5 mg YSMMCS relative to 539 endogenous peptides by 5 mg Fe 2 O 3 @nSiO(2) @mSiO(2), confirming the outstanding performance of YSMMCS in peptidome analysis...|$|E
40|$|Endokrine Disruptoren sind Substanzen, die eine estrogene Wirkung zeigen. Sie sind zum Teil in großen Mengen in unserer Umwelt zu finden und können die Entwicklung von Menschen und Tieren beeinträchtigen. Im Rahmen dieser Arbeit wurden Assays entwickelt, mit denen mehrere endokrine Substanzen im Wasser simultan mit einem Fluoreszenzbiosensor gemessen werden können. Hierzu wurden kreuzreaktive Antikörper und neuronale Netze für die Datenauswertung verwendet. Die Automatisierung und die Feldtauglichkeit des Sensors standen dabei im Vordergrund. Für den Aufbau des Assaysystems wurden polyklonale Antikörper mit der Reflektometrischen Interferenz-Spektroskopie im Hinblick auf Affinitätskonstante, Kinetik und Kreuzreaktivität charakterisiert. Es wurde ein Modell zur Beschreibung des Einflusses eines Kreuzreagenz auf die Kalibrierung eines Analyten entwickelt. Mit den erhaltenen Daten wurden Einzelkalibrierungen für Estron, Estradiol, Ethinylestradiol und Bisphenol A mit einem Biosensor beruhend auf dem „total {{internal}} reflectance fluorescence“ (TIRF) -Prinzip durchgeführt und hinsichtlich der Nachweisgrenze und Stabilität der biologischen Komponenten optimiert. Anschließend wurden binäre und ternäre Assaysysteme auf dem TIRF-Sensor entwickelt. Die Datenanalyse erfolgte mit neuronalen Netzen. Verschiedene Analyte wurden kalibriert, und eine Optimierung bezüglich der Nachweisgrenze, des Versuchsplans und des Netzdesigns, sowie die Mengen der Antikörper durchgeführt. Alle Nachweisgrenzen erreichten den sub-ppb-Bereich. Zuletzt wurde noch ein Assaysystem für den Analyten Microcystin aus Blaualgen mit dem TIRF-Sensor entwickelt. Mit diesem System soll eine Online-Überwachung von Oberflächengewässern ermöglicht werden, um letztlich ein Frühwarnsystem zu erhalten, das in kürzester Zeit (< 1 h) Informationen über mögliche Kontaminationen sammelt und diese an öffentliche Stellen weiterleitet. Endocrine disrupting compounds, especially chemicals with estrogenic activity, {{have drawn}} increasing attention {{in recent years}} because of their eventual effects on human and wildlife development and reproduction. Regarding the toxicity of these substances the contamination state of the environment, especially surface waters, is not reached. Unfortunately the critical concentration for the estrogenic effect is extremely low. Therefore a monitoring of waste water is necessary. An immunosensor for fast and direct monitoring of surface water is presented. The multi-analyte application of this sensor uses a data acquisition called neural networks. The first aspect of this work was the characterisation of the polyclonal antibodies with the reflectometric interference spectroscopy with regard to affinity constants, kinetics and cross-reactivity. Within these studies a mathematical model was developed for {{the description of the}} influence which a cross-reactant shows in the calibration of a <b>standard</b> <b>analyte.</b> With these information single-analyte calibration for estrone, estradiol, ethinylestradiol, bisphenol A, atrazine and simazine were developed on the total internal reflectance fluorescence (TIRF) - sensor and optimised in terms of limit of detection and stability of the biological compounds. Afterwards these analytes were used to develop a multi-analyte assay with cross-reactive antibodies and neural networks for data acquisition. The binary and ternary calibrations were optimised with respect to limit of detection, experimental design, and neural net design. The calibrations were validated with real samples. All limits of detection are in the sub ppb-range. Besides these cross-reactivity assays an assay for microcystin, a toxin of cyano bacteria, was developed. The main interest here was an online-monitoring of surface water to obtain an early-warning system that can immediately react e. g. on contamination of drinking water reservoirs or of lakes for bathing...|$|E
40|$|Onsite sewage {{treatment}} {{is growing in}} diversity, and in regulatory control across Australia. This is occurring for both blackwater and greywater treatment, as the drought impact deepens {{and more of the}} community are exposed to options for ‘managing’ their own water. Regulators in each State are drafting and implementing Guidelines to cover a range of on-site system scenarios. In addition, more and more decentralised options are being tendered for sewage management in the commercial world. In this project we aim to use novel molecular tools, in combination with traditional physical/chemical/biological methods, to understand onsite treatment in a more detailed manner. The system tested is a new peat based biofilter which can be used for greywater or blackwater application, and can be retrofitted to current sewage systems. This project has been based on the AquaReuse greywater system for demonstration purposes, showing the strength of the information gained from the use of novel tools. The two systems investigated are installed at a caravan park in New South Wales (NSW) and a domestic residence in Tamborine, Queensland (QLD). A 20 -week intensive sampling and analysis program was followed. The project monitored <b>standard</b> <b>analytes</b> such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5), suspended solids (SS) and thermotolerant coliforms (TC). Additionally, we studied the biological community using fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) on a monthly basis and full-cycle ribosomal RNA analysis (rRNA) for one sample to assess the biological community inhabitants. rRNA analysis at the NSW facility demonstrated a highly diverse biological community, in keeping with its long established operating period. In contrast, FISH analysis at the QLD installation showed a less diverse and younger community. rRNA and FISH identified organisms that are mostly associated with nutrient removing functions...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{describes}} an alternative generic approach to LC–MS {{for the analysis}} of drugs of abuse as well as their metabolites in post-mortem tissue samples. The platform integrates liquid extraction surface analysis (LESA) for analytes tissue extraction followed by differential ion mobility spectrometry (DMS) mass spectrometry for analytes gas phase separation. Detection is performed on a triple quadrupole linear ion trap using the selected reaction monitoring mode for quantification as well as product ion scan mode for structural confirmatory analyses. The major advantages of the platform are that neither chromatographic separation nor extensive sample preparation are required. In DMS the combination of a high separation voltage (i. e., up to 4 kV) together with organic modifiers (e. g., alcohols, acetonitrile, acetone) added in the drift gas is required to achieve the separation of isomeric metabolites, such as the ones of cocaine and tramadol. DMS also separates morphine from its glucuronide metabolites, which allows for preventing the overestimation of morphine in case of fragmentation of the glucuronides in the atmospheric-to-vacuum interface of the mass spectrometer. Cocaine, opiates, opioids, amphetamines, benzodiazepines and several of their metabolites could be identified in post-mortem human kidney and muscle tissue based on simultaneous screening and confirmatory analysis in data-dependent acquisition mode using an analyte-dependent compensation voltage to selectively transmit ions through the DMS cell to the mass analyzer. Quantitative performance of the LESA-DMS-MS platform was evaluated for cocaine and two of its metabolites spotted onto a tissue section using deuterated internal <b>standard.</b> <b>Analyte’s</b> responses were linear from 2 to 1000 pg on tissue corresponding to a limit of detection in the order of nanograms of analyte per gram of tissue.
