It is used in agriculture as a potent insect control agent with exceptional safety to non-target organisms. Spinosyns are macrolides with a 21 -carbon, tetracyclic lactone backbone to which the deoxysugars forosamine and tri-O-methylrhamnose are attached. Ac-cording to the pathway and regulation of spinosad biosynthesis, a rational selection procedure with u. v. mutation was performed to obtain high spinosad producing strain. The spinosad resistant mutants, the rhamnose resistant mutants, the 2 -deoxygen-D-glucose resistant mutants were selected, successively. Eventually, a strain S. spinosa 4 ~ 6 was obtained, with its production of spinosad reaching 268 mg/L, which is increased by 121 % in comparison with that of the parent strain S. spinosa 1 ~ 5. The subculture ex-periments indicated that the hereditary character of high production of S. spinosa 4 ~ 6 is stable. The spinosad fermentation with S. spinosa 4 ~ 6 was scaled up in a 10 L fermentor, and a production of 458 mg/L was obtained, which was 71 % higher than the production with shaking-flask fermentation...|$|R

40|$|International audienceTo {{optimize}} their efficacy, some insecticides {{used for}} mosquito control are introduced into aquatic ecosystems where mosquito larvae develop (marshes, ponds, sanitation devices) and cannot {{escape from the}} treated water. However, this {{raises the question of}} possible effects of mosquito larvicides on nontarget aquatic species. Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti), which is well-known for its selectivity for Nematocera dipterans, is widely used for mosquito control all over the world. Spinosad, <b>a</b> mixture of <b>spinosyns</b> <b>A</b> and D known as fermentation products of a soil actinomycete (Saccharopolyspora spinosa), is a biological neurotoxic insecticide with a broader action spectrum. It is a candidate larvicide for mosquito control, but some studies showed that it may be toxic to beneficial or non-target species, including non-biting midges. The present study was therefore undertaken {{to assess the impact of}} Bti and spinosad on natural populations of Polypedilum nubifer (Skuse) and Tanytarsus curticornis Kieffer (Diptera: Chironomidae) in field enclosures implemented in Mediterranean coastal wetlands. Unlike Bti, spinosad had a strong lethal effect on Polypedilum nubifer and seems to affect Tanytarsus curticornis at presumed recommended rates for field application. Differences in the sensitivity of these two species to spinosad confirm that population dynamics need to be known for a proper assessment of the risk encountered by chironomids in wetlands where larvicide-based mosquito control occurs.

Three concentrations of spinosad (8, 17 and 33 μg L− 1) and two concentrations of Bti (0. 16 and 0. 50 μL L− 1) were applied (5 replicates per concentration, including the controls). Effects of larvicides on D. pulex were evaluated after 2, 4, 7, 14 and 21 d of exposure, through measurements of abundance and individual size. Dissipation of spinosad from the water phase was rapid. Four days after treatment, residue concentration represented 11. 8 %, 3. 9 % and 12. 7 % of the initial exposure level for the nominal concentrations of 8, 17 and 33 μg L− 1, respectively. <b>Spinosyns</b> <b>A</b> and D dissipated at similar rates.

Mortality of larvae due to each pathogen/toxin was assessed in each assay for 64 treatment combinations. Both PaflNPV and AcalNPV interacted in a similar way in mixtures with Btk and displayed a significant level of synergism across several of the doses tested. The interaction between Spinosad/PaflNPV and DETC/PaflNPV was more complex but was described by the adapted ecotoxicology independent action model.

Therefore considerable interest is in the improvement of spinosad production because of its low yield in wild-type S. spinosa. Recently, a spinosad-hyperproducing PR 2 strain with stable heredity was obtained from protoplast regeneration of the wild-type S. spinosa SP 06081 strain. A comparative proteomic analysis {{was performed on the}} two strains during the first rapid growth phase (RG 1) in seed medium (SM) by using label-free quantitative proteomics to investigate the underlying mechanism leading to the enhancement of spinosad yield. Results In total, 224 proteins from the SP 06081 strain and 204 proteins from the PR 2 strain were unambiguously identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, sharing 140 proteins. A total of 12 proteins directly related to spinosad biosynthesis were identified from the two strains in RG 1. Comparative analysis of the shared proteins revealed that approximately 31 % of them changed their abundance significantly and fell in all of the functional groups, such as tricarboxylic acid cycles, glycolysis, biosynthetic processes, catabolic processes, transcription, translation, oxidation and reduction. Several key enzymes involved in the synthesis of primary metabolic intermediates used as precursors for spinosad production, energy supply, polyketide chain assembly, deoxysugar methylation, and antioxidative stress were differentially expressed in the same pattern of facilitating spinosad production by the PR 2 strain. Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that four of five selected genes showed a positive correlation between changes at the translational and transcriptional expression level, which further confirmed the proteomic analysis. Conclusions The present study is the first comprehensive and comparative proteome analysis of S. spinosa strains. Our results highlight the differentially expressed proteins between the two S. spinosa strains and provide some clues to understand the molecular and metabolic mechanisms that could lead to the increased spinosad production yield. </p...|$|R

40|$|Pericyclic {{reactions}} are important class of chemical reaction because they occur stereospecifically {{often with a}} high degree of regio-, stereoselectivity, and atom economy. This dissertation summarizes our efforts – using chemical computations – to better understand how these reactions occur in both biological and abiological settings. This dissertation is divided into two portions; the first of which describes quantum mechanical studies of biosynthetic and enzyme-catalyzed cycloadditions. Chapter 1, 2, and 3 detail studies of these enzymatic processes. Using state-of-the-art density functional theory, we have determined whether these {{reactions are}} feasible biosynthetic transformations, elucidated the mechanistic subtleties of these reactions, and proposed how enzymes may catalyze such transformations. Chapter 1 describes a computational study of a strained biosynthetic transannular 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition. Computations reveal that substrate preorganization overrides distortion in the transitions, resulting in a reaction is feasible. Efforts to account for the influence of water – through solvent-solute hydrogen-bonding interactions – were modeled using “mircosolvated” reactant and transition states: We conclude that the reaction remains feasible in aqueous media. Strategic hydrogen bonding, according to theory, can accelerate the reaction by 2000 -fold. 	Chapter 2 summarizes a computational investigation of the Diels-Alder reaction involved in the biosynthesis of <b>spinosyn</b> <b>A.</b> We find that the mechanism of this transannular cycloaddition is “ambimodal”, proceeding through a “bis-pericyclic” transition structure that leads directly two products, the observed Diels-Alder adduct and an unstable [6 + 4] adduct. This [6 + 4] adduct can readily and irreversibly rearrange into the Diels-Alder adduct via a Cope rearrangement. Simulations of the reaction mechanism determine that the nonenzymatic cycloaddition occurs predominantly via a mechanism that involves the intermediacy of the [6 + 4] adduct. 	Chapter 3 discusses an ongoing collaboration with the Tang laboratory at UCLA and involves an effort to understand the intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction involved in the biosynthesis of cholesterol-reducing agent, lovastatin. We have modeled the reaction of a related cycloaddition performed experimentally, and computations recapitulate the selectivity observed experimentally for this nonenzymatic process. The stereochemical outcome of the enzymatic reaction diverges from the outcome of its synthetic analogue. Computation of the reactive conformer of the model substrate suggests that substrate preorganization could accelerate the intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction by approximately a 1000 -fold. Theoretical studies of stereoselective electrocyclic reactions are described in Chapters 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. These reactions have been examined by experimentally by chemists in the laboratory and, subsequently, have been modeled using quantum mechanical computations. From this computational work, we have determined the stereoselectivity of several synthetically relevant electrocyclic reactions, the effect of substituents of the reactivity of the electrocyclization precursors. In Chapter 4, we summarize our work with Dr. Gregg Barcan and Prof. Ohyun Kwon to elucidate the origins of 1, 6 -stereoinduction of a triene electrocyclization employed in their total synthesis of reserpine. We determine that conformational transmission of the stereochemical information found at a distal stereocenter is “transmitted” to the forming stereogenic center via A 1, 3 strain. Allylic strain destabilizes the disfavored mode of ring closure. According to both theory and experiment, stereoselectivity is shown to be sensitive to the size of the substituent involved in the A 1, 3 strain. Chapter 5 outlines a computational investigation of the 8 π- 6 π electrocyclization cascades of substituted tetraenes, such species are common intermediates in the biosyntheses of many natural products containing bicyclo[4. 2. 0]-octadiene ring systems. These cascades reaction occur spontaneously in a growing number of natural products. Here we determined the influence terminal substitution on the reactivities, thermodynamics, and stereoselectivities of these reactions. Terminal substituents destabilize the tetraene precursor and the resulting 8 π electrocyclization product. Strain relief drives and promotes the subsequent 6 π electrocyclization. Where possible, the diastereoselectivity of this cascade is controlled by a steric effect that destabilizes the endo mode of electrocyclic ring closure. Chapter 6 reviews a density functional theory study of a series of torquoselective triene and Nazarov electrocyclizations of bridged bicyclic substrates. We find that the torquoselectivities of highly exo selective ring closures are controlled by action of torsional effect that acts in concert with either steric attraction or repulsion.
