5|$|Iron mining {{occurred}} in several locations, including the main English centre in the Forest of Dean, {{as well as}} in Durham and the Weald. Some iron to meet English demand was also imported from the continent, especially by the late 13th century. By the end of the 12th century, the older method of acquiring iron ore through <b>strip</b> <b>mining</b> was being supplemented by more advanced techniques, including tunnels, trenches and bell-pits. Iron ore was usually locally processed at a bloomery, and by the 14th century the first water-powered iron forge in England was built at Chingley. As a result of the diminishing woodlands and consequent increases in the cost of both wood and charcoal, demand for coal increased in the 12th century and it began to be commercially produced from bell-pits and <b>strip</b> <b>mining.</b>|$|E
5|$|While {{deep mining}} of coal in the Catawissa Creek {{watershed}} ceased in the 1970s, <b>strip</b> <b>mining</b> still continued for some time. However, in the 21st century, {{there are still}} five mining permits in the watershed and some coal is still extracted from refuse banks.|$|E

5|$|Breathitt was {{a member}} of National Governors Conference Executive Committee in 1964 and 1965 and chaired its Natural Resources Committee. In the 1966 legislature, he won {{approval}} for several conservation measures, including the creation of an authority to regulate water, soil, and forest resources. The session also tightened <b>strip</b> <b>mining</b> laws to prohibit mining on mountainsides that were too steep to be restored. In 1967, he was recognized with the U.S. Department of Interior's Distinguished Service Award and Outdoor Life magazine's Conservationist of the Year Award for his contributions to conservation.|$|E
5|$|From {{the middle}} of the 19th century until {{the early part of the}} 1970s, coal was mined in the eastern portion of the Catawissa Creek watershed. The coal was {{primarily}} mined in the Jeansville Coal Basin and the Green Mountain Coal Basin. The Catawissa Water Company once used water from Catawissa Creek. Five drainage tunnels were built in the watershed in the 1930s, and they still discharge acid mine drainage in the 21st century. <b>Strip</b> <b>mining</b> has occurred in parts of the watershed, mainly the Catawissa Creek headwaters and the Little Tomhicken Creek sub-watershed.|$|E
5|$|Most {{exploitation}} of oil shale involves mining followed by shipping elsewhere, after {{which one can}} burn the shale directly to generate electricity, or undertake further processing. The most common methods of surface mining involve open pit mining and <b>strip</b> <b>mining.</b> These procedures remove most of the overlying material to expose the deposits of oil shale, and become practical when the deposits occur near the surface. Underground mining of oil shale, which removes less of the overlying material, employs the room-and-pillar method.|$|E

5|$|The first {{legislative}} session of Breathitt's administration {{was a disappointment}} to his faction. His youth and narrow margin of victory in the election undermined his authority. Further, the unexpected death of Richard P. Moloney, a key legislative leader, was a blow to Breathitt's ability to push his agenda through the General Assembly. The major accomplishment of the 1964 session was the approval of a $176million bond issue to increased funding for roads, public education, the state park system, and social services. Other minor accomplishments included passing a purchasing law, strengthening <b>strip</b> <b>mining</b> regulations, and improving benefits for teachers.|$|E

5|$|Coal mining {{was done}} in the {{watershed}} of Black Creek as early as the winter of 1836–1837. Several people operated in the area until 1865, when it was leased to the E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company for 99 years. However, the mining was stopped by a strike in 1872 and for some time thereafter mining was done by several smaller companies. The mine in the watershed was run by the Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western Railroad between 1901 and 1921. The Glen Alden Corp. then operated it until 1938, at which point underground mining in the watershed stopped. <b>Strip</b> <b>mining</b> was already underway there and it continued until 1955, when all mining stopped. During World War II, coal waste in the watershed was rerun through a coal processing plant to recover coal. In 1971, the land was owned by the Blue Coal Company. A total of 22 million tons of coal have been mined in the area.|$|E
5|$|Mining {{has been}} done in the Solomon Creek {{watershed}} in the past, causing considerable environmental damage. The mining began {{in the beginning of the}} 1800s and continued until the 1970s. However, there was one <b>strip</b> <b>mining</b> permit in the watershed in the late 1990s. Starting in 1967, the mine pools under the creek stopped having water pumped out of them. This led to them flooding and damaging buildings in the watershed in 1972 during Hurricane Agnes. To remedy the problem of the flooding, the Buttonwood Tunnel and three boreholes known as the South Wilkes-Barre Boreholes were created. The water quality of the creek was assessed in 1970 as part of Operation Scarlift. A 1977 study by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission observed brook trout inhabiting the watershed, although the stream was listed as impaired on account of the mining. A plan called the Solomon Creek Cold Water Conservation Plan was initiated in the summer of 2011 and continued into 2012.|$|E

5|$|Nauru is a {{phosphate}} rock island with rich deposits near the surface, which allowed easy <b>strip</b> <b>mining</b> operations. It has some remaining phosphate resources which, , are not economically viable for extraction. Nauru boasted the highest per-capita income enjoyed by any sovereign {{state in the}} world during the late 1960s and early 1970s. When the phosphate reserves were exhausted, and the island's environment had been seriously harmed by mining, the trust that had been established to manage the island's wealth diminished in value. To earn income, Nauru briefly became a tax haven and illegal money laundering centre. From 2001 to 2008, and again from 2012, it accepted aid from the Australian Government in exchange for hosting the Nauru Regional Processing Centre. As a result of heavy dependence on Australia, many sources have identified Nauru as a client state of Australia.|$|E

He continued to personally lead tours given by the state's Chamber of Commerce. Among the industries that came to the state during his administration were the General Electric Appliance Park in Louisville and the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Paducah. In 1954, he used the state police to quash labor unrest in Central City {{and other parts of the}} Western Coal Fields.

Shortly after World War II, {{it became clear}} that coal was losing favor to other energy sources such as oil and natural gas. In contrast to other cities in the United States that prospered in the post-war boom, the fortunes of Saline County began to quickly diminish. Harry Truman stopped briefly in Harrisburg during his whistlestop tour in September 30, 1948, giving some hope for economic recovery for the region.

5|$|Mining in the creek's {{watershed}} {{began in}} 1844. A number of mining villages {{existed in the}} Tangascootack Creek watershed between 1845 and 1870. In the mid-1850s the Farrandsville Iron Company purchased large amounts of land in several places, including along Tangascootack Creek. In 1870 all of the mines in the area closed and lumbering became the area's most significant industry, with millions of board feet being floated downstream. The railroad tracks were removed and the mine buildings were abandoned or burned down. However, deep mining of the Clarion coal formation and the Lower Kittaning coal formation in the Tangascootack Creek watershed began in the 1800s and continued into the early 1900s. <b>Strip</b> <b>mining</b> operations began in the 1950s and 1960s, {{with some of the}} deep mines and surface mines being remined in the 1980s. The Independent Regulatory Review Commission issued a statement in the summer of 1987, saying that part of the North Fork Tangascootack Creek watershed was no longer suitable for surface mining. Treatment of the watershed began as early as 1998. Several projects devoted to improving the water quality of the creek had begun by 2001, by which point several more projects were planned. At least one of these projects involves the use of biosolids to encourage vegetation growth.|$|E
