5|$|A {{number of}} {{fragmented}} votive life-size sculptures of little children lying {{on their side}} and holding a pet animal or a small object were also recovered at the temple site; among {{the best known of}} these is a sculpture of a royal child holding a dove with his right hand; the boy's head is shaved, his torso is bare and his lower body is wrapped in a large cloth. The <b>socle</b> of this sculpture is inscribed with a dedication from Baalshillem, the son of a Sidonian king to Eshmun, which illustrates the importance of the site to the Sidonian monarchy. These votive sculptures appear to have been purposely broken after dedication to Eshmun and then ceremoniously cast into the sacred canal, probably simulating the sacrifice of the sick child. All of these sculptures represent boys. A limestone bust of a Kouros dating from the 6thcentury BC was found at the site, but unlike the archaic Greek kouroi this figure is not bare.|$|E

The statue {{was designed and}} made by the Dutch sculptor Frederik Engel Jeltsema. The unveiling in The Hague on 12 June 1918 was a national event. The actual unveiling was done by Queen Wilhelmina, with several ministers in attendance. The statue stands close {{to the place where}} De Witt and his brother Cornelis were killed by a mob in 1672. On the side of the <b>socle</b> a text is engraved which – in translation – reads: 'Leader and servant of the Republic, designer of it most powerful fleets, defender of the freedom of the seas, caretaker of the State's coffers, mathematician. He was a perfect Dutchman.' Muller had an important hand in the formulation of the text.|$|E

25|$|A rather unusual {{occurrence}} in Milan's artistic development was the reworking of the Piazzo del'Antico Verziere, the fruit market, which was centred around {{the construction of}} a fountain. It was completed in 1781 by the sculptor Giuseppe Franchi to a design by Piermarini with statues of mermaids and dolphins. Strangely, the square was never given a proper name, simply being called the Piazza Fontana (Fountain Square). The square was completed by the reconstruction of the facade of the Archbishop's Palace in 1784, again assigned to Piermarini. Keeping the old portal designed by Pellegrino Tibaldi, he simply added square windows, crowned with triangular tympani on the first floor, and added a new <b>socle</b> on the ground floor while creating a string course on the first floor.|$|E
25|$|Wishing {{to open up}} the square, Piermarini first {{demolished}} one of the old wings before {{concentrating on}} the renovation of the building's exterior. The result is a sober two-storey facade. The first floor contains windows with small stone cornices and a small bugnato ashlar <b>socle</b> while the other two have pilasters along the full length of the facade with tympanum windows, alternatingly triangular and curved. The interiors were then completely renewed. The entrance leads into the courtyard with its monumental Baroque staircase. To complete this part of the palace, the facade of the Church of San Gottardo in Corte had to be demolished while use was also made of the adjoining square. The most renowned artists, decorators and cabinet makers of the period were called upon to design the furniture and decorations. The external structure was completed in 1778 but work on the interior continued for several years.|$|E

This peribolos was not aligned to the axis of the temple. A raised and paved platform was built to connect the temple to the altar. There was a propylon (formal entrance gate) with a wooden superstructure in the southeast side of the peribolos. A 14m tall column topped by a sphinx was at the northeast side of the sanctuary. The full study and reconstruction of the temple was done by Schwandner, who dates it to before 570BC. In his reconstruction, the temple is prostyle-tetrastyle in plan, and has a pronaos and – significantly – an adyton {{at the back of}} the cella. As is the case at the temples of Artemis at Brauron and Aulis (among others), many temples of Artemis have such back rooms, which may indicate a similarity of cult practice. [...] The cella of the temple of Aphaia had the unusual feature of having two rows of two columns supporting another level of columns that reached the roof. The architrave of this temple was constructed in two courses, giving it a height of 1.19m versus the frieze height of 0.815m; this proportion is unusual among temples of the region, but is known from temples in Sicily. A triglyph and metope frieze is also placed along the inside of the pronaos. [...] These metopes were apparently undecorated with sculpture, and there is no evidence of pedimental sculptural groups. This temple and much of the sanctuary was destroyed by fire around 510BC.|$|E

The spire is topped by a finial with weathercock, and at its lower part contains a single run of twin-light pointed arch lucarnes, these on each alternate face, [...] each set in gables with a globed device attached above. The tower is drained by one gargoyle centrally placed on each side below the battlements. Each corner is buttressed to the full height of the tower {{on the west side}} and from the nave and aisles upwards on the east. Clasping buttresses run {{to the top of the}} third (belfry) stage, and angled buttresses run over the fourth. The tower first stage contains one large pointed arch Decorated window, this on the west side, with no hood mould and plain glazed with twin lights (lancets) [...] leading to trefoil heads. The central mullion runs to an oval rosette with quatrefoil insets, characteristic of c.1250-1310 Geometrical tracery. The second stage contains small and narrow single light windows on all but the east side. The third stage lies above the line of the nave, with the achievement of a single window on all sides. Each of these windows are of similar pattern to the bottom stage west window, but smaller, with transomseparating horizontal barand with an attached hood mould. The fourth stage windows are elongated versions of the third stage, but with added label stops at the spring of the hood mould.
