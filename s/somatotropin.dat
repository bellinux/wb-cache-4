40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} PST on the optimal production/marketing decisions of a grow-finish hog farm operation. The analysis evaluates PST from three angles: the feed efficiency effect, the leaner meat price effect, and the aggregate-supply-induced price effect, When limited to the feed efficiency effect only, the primary response to the new technology {{is to increase the}} animal turnover rate of the operation, When the leaner meat price effect is also included, marketing weight increases while turnover rate remains relatively unchanged. Additionally, if the increased aggregate supply depressed the market price by more than 10 %, the benefits from improved feed efficiency and leaner meat will be completely dissipated. Aggregate price adjustments (reductions) of less than 10 percent maintained positive producer benefits resulting from improved feed efficiency and leaner meat. Although <b>somatotropins</b> were discovered many years ago, only recent advances in recombinant DNA technology have made their commercial use economically feasible. <b>Somatotropins</b> are growth hormones which occur naturally in animals.

40|$|Advances in {{biotechnology}} {{have resulted}} in the potential for use of growth promotants in commercial livestock production. <b>Somatotropins</b> and beta-agonists are the two growth enhancers most likely to be used in beef, pork, and chicken production. The growth promotants increase production efficiency and also result in improved lean composition of meat;Commercial availability of growth promotants will have impacts on all participants in meat production, including producers, processors, consumers, crop producers, and the government, and their possible use has been controversial. The objective {{of this study is to}} determine the likely economic impacts of the adoption of growth promotants by beef and pork producers through the use of systematic ex ante evaluation framework. Key issues which must be addressed to determine the likely economic impacts of growth promotants include the timing and level of producer adoption, and consumer acceptance of meats treated with growth enhancers. Survey information and prior studies of the adoption of technology are used to determine likely producer adoption response. An experimental economics approach is used to estimate consumer acceptance of meat products produced by animals treated with growth promotants. Finally, a dynamic supply-demand econometric model of the beef, pork, and poultry industries was estimated, and used as the basis for simulating the likely impact of these technological changes;Results of the producer adoption survey suggest that beta-agonists are more likely to be adopted and to be adopted more rapidly than <b>somatotropins.</b> In addition, large producers and producers with greater management sophistication are likely to adopt more rapidly than others;Results of the consumer experiments suggest that consumers are willing to pay more for the leaner meat products obtained with the use of growth promotants, although consumers are initially concerned about the safety of the products. These results are subject to information provided with respect to the safety of growth promotants and the quality of the treated meat products;Results of the simulation of the adoption of growth promotants suggest that early adopters are likely to receive increased profits from the use of growth promotants. However, as more producers adopt, industry profits return to normal levels. Quantities of meat are more plentiful, and farm and retail prices for meat decline. Thus, consumers are the primary beneficiaries of the use of growth promotants in meat production...|$|R
40|$|Recombinant porcine (rpST) and bovine <b>somatotropins</b> (rbST) {{synthesized}} in Escherichia coli {{contain the}} amino acid, epsilon-N-acetyllysine. This amino acid was initially discovered {{in place of}} the normal lysine 144 in a modified reversed-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) species of rpST. Mass spectrometry and amino acid sequencing of a tryptic peptide isolated from this RP-HPLC purified protein were used to identify this altered residue as epsilon-N-acetyllysine. Ion-exchange chromatography was utilized to prepare low isoelectric point (pI) forms of rpST and rbST, which are enriched in epsilon-N-acetyllysine. Electrospray mass spectrometry demonstrated {{that the majority of the}} protein in these low pI fractions contained species 42 Da larger than normal. Immobilized pH gradient electrophoresis (IPG) of the ion-exchange purified low pI proteins was used to isolate several monoacetylated species of rpST and rbST. The location of the acetylated lysine in each IPG-purified protein was determined by tryptic peptide mapping and amino acid sequencing of the altered tryptic peptides. Amino acid analyses of enzymatic digests of rpST and rbST were also used to confirm the presence of epsilon-N-acetyllysine in these recombinant proteins. These data demonstrate that a significant portion of rpST and rbST produced in E. coli contain this unusual amino acid...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of growth}} hormones (recombinant <b>somatotropins</b> (rSTs)) is {{approved}} in several countries, e. g. the USA, Brazil and Australia to enhance growth or lactating performances of livestock. Their {{use in the}} EU is banned, however, due to the widespread application, the illegal use within the EU cannot be excluded. To screen for rSTs in injection preparations, a biosensor immunoassay (BIA) using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology was developed. Compared to existing analysis methods for rSTs, like radio immunoassay (RIA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), this technique provides a rapid (7 min) alternative. A direct BIA was compared to an indirect (inhibition) BIA and the performances of several antibodies against (r) STs were compared in the indirect BIA. In the final inhibition assay, using rabbit anti-bovine rST, extracts from several injection preparations were shown to contain bovine rST (rbST). The limit of detection for rbST in the assay is 0. 008 mu g mL(- 1) which is far below the expected concentrations in injection preparations. Although the cross-reactivities for STs of other species were low, screening of injection preparations for porcine, equine and human ST was feasible through the analysis of less diluted extracts. Tryptic digestion followed by nano-electrospray liquid chromatography-ion trap tandem mass spectrometry (nano-LC-MS/MS) was used to identify STs. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
25|$|Acromegaly (also {{known as}} hypersomatotropism) is a {{hormonal}} condition resulting from over-secretion {{of the growth}} hormone <b>somatotropin</b> from the pituitary gland. The hormone is responsible for growth from birth to adulthood. Normally in adulthood, the growth plates of the bones close and the secretion of the hormone slows considerably. Because the bone plates close when entering maturity, the continued growth of acromegaly is not of normal proportions. Most dogs with the disease are unspayed females, but the condition can come about with use of medications containing progesterone. Acromegaly patients often also have diabetes mellitus. There is a transient form of acromegaly which can affect females at the diestrus portion of the reproductive cycle. This condition is {{brought about by the}} mammary glands excreting excess growth hormone, which is triggered by progesterone from the ovaries. As with non-transient acromegaly, spaying is necessary. The symptoms can include overgrowth or enlargement of gums with wide spaces between teeth, increased drinking, increased urination, thickening of the skin and skin folds, enlargement of the tongue and excessive panting. Acromegaly is also possible from a somatotroph adenoma. The hormone somatostatin can also be useful in treatment. Since hypothyroidism is connected with the release of excess growth hormone, hypothyroidism can be mistaken for acromegaly.|$|E

40|$|Recombinant bovine <b>somatotropins</b> (rbST) {{have been}} {{synthesized}} and manufactured using recombinant DNA (rDNA) techniques. The rbST has increased milk production in dairy animals, including cow, sheep and goats. There are management factors including dosage of rbST, injection interval, genetic potential and environmental conditions which affect {{the magnitude of}} the animal-response to rbST. For dairy cows, the optimal dose of rbST treatment is between 25 and 50 mg/day. Daily injection of rbST may produce better response, but sustained-release formulations of rbST are more practical. The magnitude of milk production response to rbST range from 10 to 35 % in dairy cows. The rbST has no or little effects on the milk composition, processing properties and taste. The rbST did not affect digestion of feeds or the efficiency of utilizing absorbed nutrients for milk synthesis, and it has no or little effect on rumen fermentation, flow of nutrients to the small intestine and total tract digestibility, but it improves the feed efficiency in dairy cows. The rbST induced significant increase in serum bST. It has a galactopoietic effect, since it increase the metabolic activity of mammary cells or slow their involution, thereby allowing more secretory cells to persist over time and contribute to increasing milk synthesis and yield. It has a great impact on mammary gland development and subsequently milk-producing capacity in dairy heifers. The rbST increase the hypothyroid status of lactating cows and maintai...|$|R
40|$|The European Union {{has banned}} {{the use of}} {{recombinant}} bovine <b>somatotropins</b> (rbST, growth hormones) to increase milk yield in dairy cattle. As direct detection of rbST in serum is problematic, methods based on the detection of changes in multiple rbST-dependent biomarkers have high potential for monitoring rbST abuse. In this study immunoassays were developed for total {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (IGF- 1) in cow sera. Ultimately aiming at combination with other rbST-dependent biomarker assays two multiplex formats were studied and compared critically, a multi-channel surface plasmon resonance (SPR) -based biosensor and flow cytometry combined with color encoded microbeads. Moreover, a new dedicated sample pretreatment was developed for the dissociation of complexed IGF- 1 in serum, while keeping other biomarkers in solution. Compared to the SPR biosensor immunoassay, the flow cytometric immunoassay (FCIA) was more sensitive, less antibody-consuming and less vulnerable to necessary but interfering reagents from the sample treatment. In an initial in-house validation study the developed FCIA showed to be fast, specific, robust, and a high repeatability and reliability, and generated realistic IGF- 1 values for bovine serum, without compromising the potential for simultaneous detection of other biomarkers. Due to the xMAP technology, in which 100 different bead sets can be measured simultaneously, the total IGF- 1 assay can easily be extended with other immunoassays for candidate biomarkers. Preliminary results about a FCIA for IGF- 1 multiplexing with insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP 2) are presented which strongly supported both the FCIA multiplex format as well as the generic nature of the developed sample pretreatment...|$|R
40|$|Second-generation biosimilars (i. e. {{monoclonal}} antibodies or proteins {{generated by}} fusion of antibody and receptor moieties) differ in several respects {{as compared to}} first-generation ones (e. g. epoetins, bone marrow stimulating factors, <b>somatotropins).</b> In this respect, as second-generation biosimilars are endowed with much greater structural and molecular complexity, which might translate {{into a number of}} pharmacological and therapeutic issues, they raise new challenges for manufacturers and regulatory authorities as well as new concerns for clinicians. Based on these arguments, the present article was intended to review information on the main differences between first- and second-generation biosimilars for treatment of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, as well as their impact on immunogenicity, the design of clinical trials and the critical issue of extrapolation of therapeutic indications. The positions taken by relevant medical associations and the crucial role of pharmacovigilance are also reviewed. According to current knowledge, the initial post-marketing clinical experience with second-generation biosimilars is providing encouraging results, though their long-term safety and efficacy as well as the scientific basis underlying the extrapolation of therapeutic indications are still matter of discussion. There is some consensus that marketing applications should rely on studies supporting the clinical use of biosimilars in their different target diseases and patient populations. In parallel, clinical safety must be ensured by a strict control of the manufacturing processes and a solid pharmacovigilance program. It remains then a responsibility of the physician to drive a proper use of second-generation biosimilars into clinical practice, in accordance with guidelines issued by scientific societies...|$|R

40|$|Biotechnology, {{especially}} genetic engineering, is {{a revolutionary}} tool in life-science research. When it came, {{people thought it}} would have the greatest impact both on pharmaceutical and agriculture industries, because both are directly based on knowledge of life-science. As a matter of fact, a lot of knowledge of life at molecular level has been produced using the technology and it is giving big impacts to various industries. With respect to agriculture, to accumulate knowledge on plant physiology {{at the molecular level}} is important not just for plant genetic engineering, but to develop a future agricultural system that will be sustainable, environmentally safe and/or productive enough to satisfy expanding global population. Though the benefit is considered to be enormous in the long run, investment in the basic plant science is not enough and consequently plant biotechnology is still underdeveloped compared with pharmaceutical. In 1981 genetic engineering was expected to generate $ 3 billion market in the field of agriculture by 1990. This expected market size was four times larger than that of biotechnology pharmaceuticals. However, as of August, 1991, there is no commercially available products of genetic engineering in agricultural field except for some veterinary vaccines. On the other hand, several recombinant pharmaceuticals have already been commercialized and attained a big market. For example, Genentech's tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) has $ 200 million market, and Amgen's erythropoietin (EPO) has also $ 200 million market in the U. S. A. in 1990. There is a significant lag in of agricultural biotechnology. A typical example is Monsanto's case. Monsanto which is a U. S. large chemical and a leading agricultural biotechnology firm as well, has invested $ 1 billion to develop such products as bovine and swine <b>somatotropins</b> and genetically engineered plants since 1981, but it has no product commercialized yet. With respect to plant biotechnology field, in 1984 not only Monsanto but everyplant biotech firm expected that the tomato would be the first commercialized product of genetically engineering and Monsanto expected that the earliest date of commercialization would be 1993. At that time, however, there was no specific product to develop for commercialization yet. In 1988 the Monsant's virus-resistant tomato was expected to be commercialized in 1992., but this was premature. According to a recent Business Week article, the earliest expected data of commercialization of the Monsant's virus-resistant tomato is 1997 and its estimated market is just $ 30 million. Instead, an insect-resistant cotton is expected to be commercialized earlier and to have a larger market. The expected date is 1996 and the estimated market size is $ 100 million. R&D of genetically engineered plants, in general, are taking longer time than expected in earlier stage.
