40|$|Cash flow {{forecasting}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} essential tools toward assessing the distribution of expenditure and revenues of construction projects with respect to the time of the project. The work presented in this paper aims to find out the minimum fund required for cash outflow in case of delay in payments and to identify contractual implications and consequences due to failure of meeting planned cash flow on both the owner and the contractor. Data from record files of 25 villas, in Muscat, Oman, with different sizes was analysed to identify the minimum fund required with the contractor to maintain the progress of work in-case of delay of interim payments. The analysis also included identification of consequences of delay of interim payments. It was found that the minimum fund required is 8. 5 per cent of the contract value for maximum interim payment delay of four weeks. The value of required minimum fund increases as the period of delay increases. In most cases the percentage of the required minimum fund increases with the increase of the contract value. Work <b>stoppage,</b> <b>delay</b> in completion, penalties and incompletion of projects are major consequences of delay on interim payments...|$|E
30|$|Achieving caloric targets with EN may be {{challenging}} in the critically ill. A caloric deficit frequently occurs due to slow intake progression, unnecessary <b>stoppages,</b> <b>delayed</b> gastric emptying, enteral feed intolerance and delays in post-pyloric feeding tube placement [6]. The cumulative deficit or caloric debt {{has been reported}} to be associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Villet and co-workers showed that delayed initiation of feeding resulted in a marked cumulative energy debt during the first week after ICU admission associated with an increase in infectious complications, days of mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay. However, possibly not only energy deficit but also deficient protein intake may be relevant and is suggested {{to play a role in}} outcome [7],[8].|$|R
50|$|The {{race was}} run {{over two days}} and had two legs, each one {{scheduled}} to be eighty laps and 250km in length. However, due to <b>stoppages</b> and <b>delays</b> on each day while other categories were running, the Saturday leg was shortened to 73 laps and the Sunday leg to 60 laps. The first leg was won by John Bowe and Peter O'Donnell in a BMW 335i while Kostera and Tulloch won the second leg and the race overall.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{and tests}} a scale for hindrance {{in the context}} of in-app mobile advertising. With the changes in mobile advertising capabilities, research on attitudes towards mobile advertising has mainly focused on SMS advertising. However, the formats in mobile advertising have increased since the introduction of smartphones and mobile internet capabilities. We propose that within in-app mobile advertising, current models on attitudes towards this type of advertising do not reflect the use and perception of users of these platforms. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, we explore the role that hindrance within mobile advertising plays towards the attitudes of consumers. We then develop and test quantitatively a scale that measures the construct hindrance and its four dimensions (<b>stoppage,</b> distraction, <b>delay</b> and interruption) ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{something}} in this. Mrs Pipchin's husband having broken his heart of the Peruvian mines was good. It had a rich sound. Besides, Mr Dombey {{was in a state}} almost amounting to consternation at the idea of Paul remaining where he was one hour after his removal had been recommended by the medical practitioner. It was a <b>stoppage</b> and <b>delay</b> upon the road the child must traverse, slowly at the best, before the goal was reached. Their recommendation of Mrs Pipchin had great weight with him; for he knew that they were jealous of any interference with their charge, and he never for a moment took it into account that they might be solicitous to divide a responsibility, of which he had, as shown just now, his own established views. Broke his heart of the Peruvian mines, mused Mr Dombey. Well! a very respectable way of doing It.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to other sports, the huddle {{is a specific}} tactic in Australian football, used by the team kicking in after a behind is scored, or some <b>delayed</b> <b>stoppage.</b> All players in the backline gather together about fifty meters from goal. Then, the players individually lead away from the huddle in all directions. The technique means {{that there will be}} several leading players, making it difficult to defend the first kick-in. It also allows teams to run set plays for the second and third kicks. The huddle was developed during the 1970s, and is still used today by many teams.|$|R
50|$|Tianjin-Baoding Intercity Railway, {{also known}} as Tianjin-Baoding Passenger Line, is a {{high-speed}} railway line in China, connecting Tianjin and the Hebei city of Baoding. Starting from Tianjin West Railway Station and finally to Baoding Railway Station, the railway length is 158 km and with a maximum design speed of 250 km. The project was jointly developed by the Ministry of Railways, Tianjin and Hebei Provincial Governments, supplying a total investment of 24 billion yuan. Construction began in March 2010 and the original plan was to be opened to traffic in 2013, however the progress of construction has experienced numerous work <b>stoppages</b> with completion <b>delayed</b> until December 28, 2015. Future high speed railconnections have been proposed to branch off this line to the new Beijing Daxing International Airport currently under construction, allowing this airport to serve the greater Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region.|$|R
50|$|In Canadian football, the {{offensive}} team must run a play within 20 {{seconds of the}} referee whistling the play in; in amateur American football, teams have 25 seconds {{from the time the}} ball is declared ready for play. In the NFL, teams have 40 seconds timed {{from the end of the}} previous down, or 25 seconds after the ball is declared ready for play after certain administrative <b>stoppages</b> and game <b>delays.</b> Before 2008, in college football, the play clock was 25 seconds after the ball was set, but the clock was not stopped for the ball to be set unless the previous play resulted in a stoppage of the clock. Now, the same intervals as the NFL are used, with minor differences for the final two minutes of each half. Various professional leagues have used their own standards; the XFL, for instance, used a 35-second play clock to encourage faster play.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To clarify how {{infection}} control requirements are represented, communicated, and understood in work interactions through the medical facility construction project life cycle. To assist project participants with effective {{infection control}} management by highlighting {{the nature of}} such requirements and presenting recommendations to aid practice. Background: A 4 -year study regarding client requirement representation and use on National Health Service construction projects in the United Kingdom provided empirical evidence of infection control requirement communication and understanding through design and construction work interactions. Methods: An analysis of construction project resources (e. g., infection control regulations and room data sheets) was combined with semi-structured interviews with hospital client employees and design and construction professionals to provide valuable insights into the management of infection control issues. Results: Infection control requirements are representationally indistinct but also omnipresent through all phases of the construction project life cycle: Failure to recognize their nature, relevance, and significance can result in <b>delays,</b> <b>stoppages,</b> and redesign work. Construction project resources (e. g., regulatory guidance and room data sheets) can mask or obscure the meaning of infection control issues. Conclusions: A preemptive identification of issues combined with knowledge sharing activities among project stakeholders can enable infection control requirements to be properly understood and addressed. Such initiatives should also reference existing infection control regulatory guidance and advice...|$|R
50|$|Qualifying {{was held}} over three sessions, each {{two hours in}} length. The first session was held on the Wednesday night before the race, with the second on Thursday {{afternoon}} and the final session of qualifying {{taking place in the}} early evening of Thursday. Several <b>stoppages</b> for accidents <b>delayed</b> or prematurely ended each of the sessions, while rain affected the Wednesday and first Thursday sessions. At the end of Thursday, a time of 3:22.346 set by Loïc Duval in the No. 2 Audi {{at the end of the}} Wednesday session claimed the overall pole position for the race. Audi locked up the top three spots on the podium, followed by the pair of Toyotas over four seconds off the pole pace. The pole in the LMP2 category was set by Olivier Pla for OAK Racing in the closing laps of Thursday qualifying, beating the time of John Martin set on Wednesday. The No. 99 Aston Martin provisionally held the LMGTE Pro pole position Wednesday, only to be beaten by the No. 97 sister car of Stefan Mücke on Thursday before Frédéric Makowiecki reclaimed the top spot for the No. 99, giving Aston Martin a one-two result ahead of Porsche. The LMGTE Am category was led on both days by the No. 95 Aston Martin, with Allan Simonsen setting the fastest lap for the team.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{electromagnetic}} compatibility (EMC) problems of distributed electrical networks, especially that caused by lightning to electrified railway. Lightning transients were found to damage important devices that control train movements, causing traffic <b>stoppage</b> and <b>delays.</b> This thesis attempts to develop computational models for identification of parameters influencing the coupling phenomena between those devices and lightning. Some supporting experimental investigations are also carried out. This thesis forms the groundwork {{on the subject of}} lightning interaction with the electrified railway networks. Lightning induces transient overvoltages in railway conductor systems such as tracks, overhead wires, and underground cables, either due to direct lightning strike to the system or due to the coupling of electromagnetic fields from remote strikes. Models based on multiconductor transmission line theory were developed for calculating the induced voltages and currents. A transmission line return stroke model, that can predict the remote electromagnetic fields comparable to experimental observations, is also developed. Earlier works on modeling earth return impedances for transient studies in power distribution systems are not readily applicable for railways for lightning transients, in cases of low earth conductivities found in Sweden and for large variation in conductor heights. For the wires above ground, the ground impedance models were modified for wide range of frequencies, soil conductivities and wide spread of conductor heights. Influences of pole insulator flashovers, pole-footing soil ionizations and interconnections between the conductors on the lightning surge propagation are studied. Wave propagation in buried shielded and unshielded cables with ground return is studied. Simplified, valid and computationally efficient ground impedance expressions for buried and on-ground wires are proposed. A model for the coupling phenomena (transfer impedance) through multiple cable shields with multiconductor core is also proposed. Besides, experimental studies on lightning induced transients entering a railway technical house, failure modes of relay and rectifier units used in the train position/signaling applications for lightning transients are performed. A high frequency circuit model for the booster transformer for lightning interaction studies is developed. The simulation models are being converted to user-friendly software for the practicing engineers of the railway industry...|$|R
40|$|In {{the early}} {{electrified}} railway systems, {{the design of}} signal and control networks were not always made {{in accordance with the}} strict rules of Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC). This created problems due to Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) when old electro-mechanical signalling, control and communication systems were replaced by modern sensitive electronic circuits. Modern developments in the railway systems have made the system more vulnerable to lightning transients, a natural source of EMI, because the overall network is not designed to reduce the lightning surges to the low levels tolerable to the electronic systems widely being introduced in the railway system. Railway networks are extensive and modernization of signal/control/communication systems are carried out in stages at different times, it is not unusual to find transient related problems in a section of the network on account of inadequate lightning protection design or EMC design of the existing network in which a new module (equipment or system) is introduced. These problems may act as a brake on the upgrading plans of the railways. Also the new railway systems which incorporate advanced signal/control/communication systems sometimes suffers from the effects of lightning transients because many of the standards and guidelines used in the design dates back to the age of electromechanical devices and hence do not include robust transient protection design. There have been many attempts to address EMC issues in railways, but usually these attempts were confined to solving immediate problems of EMI due to introduction of new locomotive drives and EMI due to sparks at the pantograph. A comprehensive review of railway system from the angle of lightning protection and EMC is not yet fully carried out. The Swedish National Rail Administration (Banverket) reported a delay of about 900 - 1000 hours in the years 2001 - 02. Lightning transients were found to damage important devices that control train movements, causing traffic <b>stoppage</b> and <b>delays.</b> This work therefore discusses the EMC problems of large distributed systems, with particular reference to lightning interaction with Swedish rail networks [1]. Lightning induces transient overvoltages in railway conductor systems such as tracks, overhead wires, and underground cables, either due to direct lightning strike to the system or due to the coupling of electromagnetic fields from remote strikes. Models based on multiconductor transmission line theory were developed for calculating the induced voltages and currents [1 - 3]. Some experiments have also been carried out to better understand {{the way in which the}} lighting transients’ couple into the systems and also to verify the models used for analysis [4]. From experiments high frequency behavior of different types of transformers used within the railway systems were also derived [1, 6].   Besides, experimental studies on lightning induced transients entering railway systems, failure modes of relay and rectifier units used in the train position/signaling applications for lightning transients are performed. The simulation models are being converted to user friendly software for the practicing engineers of the railway industry [1]. Presented at the EuroEM Conference 2008, Lausanne, Switzerlan...|$|R
