60|$|They went, {{and she sat}} upon a stone {{while he}} knelt beside her and untied his scarf from her arm. As the blood had hardened, it was {{necessary}} to <b>slit</b> her <b>sleeve</b> to the shoulder. Using his scarf, he washed the blood from the wound, and found it to be merely a cut, a groove, on the surface.|$|R

50|$|A mantelletta, Italian {{diminutive}} of Latin mantellum 'mantle', is a sleeveless, knee-length, vest-like garment, open in front, with <b>slits</b> {{instead of}} <b>sleeves</b> on the sides, fastened at the neck, once even {{more common than}} the mozzetta.|$|R
5000|$|Beginning in the 1970s Pierre Cardin set {{another new}} trend: ‘mod chic’. This trend {{holds true for}} form or for a {{combination}} of forms, which did not exist at the time. Cardin {{was the first to}} combine extremely short and ankle length pieces; making dresses with <b>slits,</b> batwing <b>sleeves</b> with dimensions, mixing circular movement and gypsy skirts with structured tops. These creations by Cardin allowed for the geometric shapes that captivated him to be contrasted, both circular and straight lines. Pierre Cardin was an icon for starting this popular fashion movement of the early seventies.|$|R
50|$|Typical costuming for {{performances}} of this dance style {{is a long}} dress covering the midriff, which may be plain and traditional, or heavily embellished. Traditionally, a baladi dress would resemble a theatrical version of traditional Egyptian clothing. The most common version has a straight skirt with side <b>slits,</b> long <b>sleeves</b> which may be slit to the elbows, and a scooped or shirt-style neckline. Striped fabrics or tulle bi-telli are popular. A sash may be worn around the hips, and a headscarf is often also worn. A baladi-style performance may {{include the use of}} sagat, or the dancer may perform with a cane (assaya).|$|R
50|$|Some professions, {{such as the}} Jaffa boatmen, {{had their}} own unique uniforms. The horse or mule drivers (mukaaris), widely used between the towns in an age before proper roads, wore a short {{embroidered}} jacket with long <b>sleeves</b> <b>slit</b> open on the inside, red shoes and a small yellow woolen cap with a tight turban.|$|R
60|$|This {{was hailed}} as a good proposal, though some were of opinion it was too gentle. However, it was agreed to, with this addition, that the culprit's capote should be cut to pieces. In order to {{accomplish}} {{the latter part of}} the ceremony with more ease, one of the men removed the capote by the simple process of ripping the back up to the neck, and <b>slitting</b> the <b>sleeves</b> with a scalping-knife. The man here showed a disposition to resist, and began to struggle, but a quiet squeeze from Warder convinced him that it was useless. He was then seized by four men, each of whom, grasping an arm or a leg, carried him down to the water's edge. They passed Mr Ravenshaw in the opening of his tent. He rose and followed them.|$|R
50|$|Because {{the college}} was all-female {{for much of}} its history, {{the design of the}} college gown is that of those {{traditionally}} worn by female undergraduates in early twentieth century Cambridge (this is shared by all the historically-female colleges: Girton, Newnham, and Murray Edwards). The gown is based on the original Cambridge black gown, still worn by undergraduates at Peterhouse, but has the <b>slits</b> in the <b>sleeves</b> closed up. As a homage to its all-female origins, or simply because the college has never had one re-designed, this gown is now worn by all undergraduates at the college regardless of sex.|$|R
60|$|At {{the sound}} of his voice the girl moved toward the mats. Her black hair hung like a mantle. Her sarong, the kilt-like garment which both sexes wear, had the {{national}} check of grey and red, but she had not completed her attire by the belt, scarves, the loose upper wrappings, and the head-covering of a woman. A black silk jacket, like that of a man of rank, was buttoned over her bust and fitted closely to her slender waist. The edge of a stand-up collar, stiff with gold embroidery, rubbed her cheek. She had no bracelets, no anklets, and although dressed practically in man's clothes, had about her person no weapon of any sort. Her arms hung down in exceedingly tight <b>sleeves</b> <b>slit</b> a little way up from the wrist, gold-braided and with a row of small gold buttons. She walked, brown and alert, all of a piece, with short steps, the eyes lively in an impassive little face, the arched mouth closed firmly; and her whole person breathed in its rigid grace the fiery gravity of youth at the beginning of the task of life--at the beginning of beliefs and hopes.|$|R
