500|$|While it was {{not named}} {{as a cause of}} the accident, {{investigators}} also found that the passenger safety briefing cards in the airplane showed two types of galley <b>service</b> <b>doors.</b> However, only one door is installed on a particular F28 model at any one time. The examination also showed that the safety card did not show how to operate either of the two types of galley <b>service</b> <b>doors</b> in the emergency mode if the normal opening mode failed. However, the final report stated that this [...] "did not contribute to the fatalities in the accident." ...|$|R

The cabin crew reported to the captain {{that there had been}} a bang from the aft <b>service</b> <b>door,</b> and that there was a hand-sized hole in the door's seal. The Air Accident and Incident Investigation Board (AAIIB) of Cyprus could not conclusively determine the causes of the incident, but indicated two possibilities: an electrical malfunction causing the opening of the outflow valve, or the inadvertent opening of the aft <b>service</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E

The bins are wider to accommodate garment bags without folding, and strengthened for heavier carry-on items. A single, large galley is installed near the aft doors, allowing for more efficient meal service and simpler ground resupply. Passenger and <b>service</b> <b>doors</b> are an overhead plug type, which retract upwards, and commonly used doors can {{be equipped with}} an electric-assist system.|$|R

50|$|Historically, Romanichals {{earned a}} living doing {{agricultural}} work and {{would move to}} the edges of towns for the winter months. There was casual work available on farms throughout the spring, summer and autumn months; spring would start with seed sowing, planting potatoes and fruit trees, early summer with weeding, and there would be a succession of harvests of crops from summer to late autumn. Of particular significance was the hop industry, which employed thousands of Romanichals both in spring for vine training and for the harvest in early autumn. Winter months were often spent doing casual labour in towns or selling goods or <b>services</b> <b>door</b> to door.|$|R
5000|$|By autumn 1886., the :fr:Quebec and Lake St-John Railway reached lake Edward and, in 1888, Roberval {{village at}} lake St John (the Canadian National Railway bought {{the company in}} 1918). A railway station with telegraph, a dormitory, a {{shunting}} yard, a water tower, a coal shed and a repair shop for steam locomotive were built near lake Edward, 179 km from Québec city, midway to lake St-John. The six <b>service</b> <b>doors</b> of the repair shop (train roundhouse, called the [...] "Rotonde") were set in a semi-circle allowing access to steam locomotives on a large turntable.
