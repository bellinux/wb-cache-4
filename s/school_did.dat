History professor Timothy Gilfoyle wrote that Banks' talent for baseball was discovered by Bill Blair, a family friend who scouted for the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro American League. Other sources say Banks was noticed by Cool Papa Bell of the Monarchs.|$|E
5|$|Delta County has {{historically}} been advanced in education. Around the time that Cooper and the county were founded, there were already nine churches in the county. By 1880, that number had increased to nearly 30. There were a combined 998 students attending those schools, which operated 4½ months a year. In 1889, East Texas Normal College was founded in Cooper. The <b>school</b> <b>did</b> very well while located in Cooper, but the college moved to Commerce after the campus was destroyed in a fire in 1894. The school was later renamed East Texas State University, then Texas A University–Commerce. In 1896, Cooper reported to have one successful school located within the city proper.|$|E

The Curies {{did not have a}} dedicated laboratory; most of their research was carried out in a converted shed next to the School of Physics and Chemistry. The shed, formerly a medical school dissecting room, was poorly ventilated and not even waterproof. They were unaware of the deleterious effects of radiation exposure attendant on their continued unprotected work with radioactive substances. The <b>School</b> <b>did</b> not sponsor her research, but she would receive subsidies from metallurgical and mining companies and from various organizations and governments.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, a Cecil Priestley was {{temporarily}} employed by Henn {{as a member}} of the Guildford Grammar School staff. It seems today that he conceived the idea of a Guildford Preparatory School.

5|$|In July 1866, Willamette University's {{trustees}} {{formed a}} committee to explore {{the possibility of a}} legal department. At that time, legal education was traditionally taught as an apprenticeship in which those wishing to be lawyers would study under an existing attorney for several years before being allowed to pass the bar. Although the <b>school</b> <b>did</b> not begin a legal department in 1866, Willamette did confer a Doctor of Laws degree on Matthew P.

Jewett served as Vassar's first president from his election to the office in February 1861 until his departure from the college in spring 1864 after a dispute with the school's founder and namesake, Matthew Vassar. Although Jewett was instrumental in providing {{a vision for the}} college, the <b>school</b> <b>did</b> not open until 1865 meaning he never had the chance to oversee its student body.|$|E
5|$|While the Lingbao <b>school</b> <b>did</b> {{not survive}} as a {{distinct}} entity, its ritual apparatus did, and it forms the basis for present-day Daoist ritual practice. In addition, many of the innovations introduced by the Lingbao School have survived to the present, including its division of the Daozang into three sections corresponding to different teachings, with the Dongzhen corresponding to the Shangqing School, the Dongxuan to the Lingbao School, and the Dongshen to the Sanhuang teaching. The integration of Buddhism within Lingbao practices and beliefs ensured that Buddhist elements would remain {{an important aspect of}} later Daoism, and also aided in integrating Buddhism into all levels of society in China.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{attended}} Rugby School. Unhappy {{during his}} school years, {{he made no}} lasting friendships there. Although he did reasonably well in his classes, he was not outstanding academically or athletically, and his father withdrew him from the school four months short of his eighteenth birthday. In later years, as Chamberlain rose to the heights of British politics, he seldom visited the <b>school,</b> <b>did</b> not enrol his own son, and rarely spoke of his time there. Joseph Chamberlain then sent Neville to Mason College (which later developed into the University of Birmingham), which both emphasised the politician's connection to Birmingham and catered to the interest in science which Neville had shown at Rugby. Neville Chamberlain studied metallurgy and engineering for two years, but {{had little interest in}} the subjects. In 1889 his father apprenticed him to a firm of accountants. Within six months, he became a salaried employee.|$|E

Beginning with the 1971 {{football}} season, the Southwest Conference forbade the inclusion of live animal mascots to away games unless the host school consented. For situations where the host <b>school</b> <b>did</b> not want to allow the Masked Rider's horse, an alternate mascot was needed. Jim Gaspard, {{a member of the}} Saddle Tramps student spirit organization, created the original design for the Raider Red costume, basing it on a character created by cartoonist Dirk West, a Texas Tech alumnus and former Lubbock mayor. Though the Masked Rider's identity is public knowledge, it has always been tradition that Raider Red's student alter ego is kept secret until the end of his or her tenure.

5|$|The 2014–15 Wolverines {{had entered}} the season coming off the school's winningest two-year stretch in history, {{but it did not}} reach the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament after losing {{starters}} Caris LeVert and Derrick Walton to season-ending injuries in January. The 2015–16 team follows the first season in five years in which the <b>school</b> <b>did</b> not make the NCAA Tournament. In addition to the season-ending injuries for LeVert and Walton the prior season, the team was coming off an offseason which saw Spike Albrecht and Zak Irvin have surgeries. Albrecht retired from the sport in December, although he later changed his mind. Later that month, Levert had an injury that ended his season. He only played in one conference game. He led the team in many statistical categories {{at the time of his}} injury and made midseason watchlists for various major national awards.|$|E
5|$|The {{son of a}} builder, O'Neill {{was born}} in Carlton, New South Wales. He had no cricketing {{associations}} on his father's side of the family, but his maternal uncle, Ron Campion, played for the Glebe club in Sydney Grade Cricket. Campion trained for cricket near the O'Neill family home, at Bexley Oval. O'Neill accompanied his uncle to cricket {{from the age of}} seven and was given batting practice {{at the end of each}} session. At Bexley Primary school, O'Neill was denied a chance to play cricket as the <b>school</b> <b>did</b> not field a team. Moving on to Kogarah Intermediate High School, O'Neill played cricket in defiance of a teacher who recommended that he take up athletics. As a teenager, O'Neill idolised Keith Miller after his uncle took him to the Sydney Cricket Ground: O'Neill saw Miller play that day and was impressed with the way he hit the ball off the back foot.|$|E

When the school board was alerted of the matter, it attempted to censor the edition, passing a resolution requiring the Green Bag to be reviewed by Principal Francis A. Soper. However, the year book had already been printed, and the editors refused to have the edition censored and reprinted. The school board responded by withholding the diplomas of six of the editors of the Green Bag and the business manager, and by preventing the school from holding a commencement ceremony. One of the boys expelled, Clarence Keating Bowie, {{became a member of the}} school board in 1926.|$|E
5|$|Zoldak {{was born}} on December 8, 1918 in Brooklyn, New York.

He began his professional career with the Palatka Azaleas in 1938, and threw 13 innings in two games. He was released afterwards, and played college baseball for the Fordham Rams baseball team while also playing some semi-professional baseball for a team in Cedarhurst, New York. Zoldak was signed by Philadelphia Athletics owner Connie Mack before the 1941 season, ending his college baseball career and restarting his professional one.|$|E
