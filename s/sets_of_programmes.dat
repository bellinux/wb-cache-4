40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effects <b>of</b> treatment <b>programmes</b> for drug abusing offenders in Europe, using stringent eligibility criteria to control for threats to internal validity. A literature search of approximately 37, 000 titles revealed 15 sound evaluations from six countries, containing 3953 participants. There were significant positive overall effects of treatment on crime (d= 0. 47) and illicit drug use (d= 0. 38). Most evaluations originated from the UK and evaluated primarily substitution therapy-based treatment. Evaluations of other interventions were a minority. Our findings support the use <b>of</b> treatment <b>programmes</b> among substance-abusing offenders. However, these results are limited to a small <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>programmes</b> from very few countries. Therefore, sound evaluations on a range of treatments across Europe are needed...|$|R
30|$|While the UK ERA {{results are}} {{somewhat}} weaker than other financial incentive programmes, they {{are consistent with}} other employment programmes for low wage workers. Hendra & Hamilton, (2015 forthcoming) provide a review <b>of</b> various <b>programmes</b> focused on unemployed/employed low wage workers. Within that <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>programmes,</b> the UK ERA results are broadly similar to many welfare-to-work <b>programmes.</b> Most <b>of</b> these <b>programmes</b> had positive estimated impacts that faded over time. Compared to other post-employment services programmes (such as those studied in the Post Employment Services Demonstration or the US Employment Retention and Advancement project), the UK ERA results are more positive: many <b>of</b> those <b>programmes</b> had no estimated impacts on employment or earnings (Rangaran et al., 1999 & Hendra et al., 2010).

40|$|Demand Side Response (DSR) {{consists}} <b>of</b> a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>programmes,</b> {{policies and}} technologies that enable shifting energy demand {{in time with}} varying degrees of end user’s engagement. It is increasingly seen as the main tool for achieving flexible and responsive energy demand. The objective of this chapter is to move beyond existing approaches to better incorporate the material technological arrangements of appliances, infrastructures, and the social rhythms of everyday coordination into analysis of DSR in practice. In so doing we propose clearer definitions of both how flexibility and responsiveness should be understood. Taking the example of hotels as a site of energy demand, we detail which energy loads have potential for demand responsiveness and focus on questions of automation at different stages of the DSR process...|$|R

40|$|The article, {{starting}} from {{a definition of}} the university system considered as an institution based on self-constituted cultural premises, {{draws attention to the}} main problems that the university has nowadays to solve. In particular, its basic characteristics consolidated in the past, as the place of the university at the summit of the educational process, its ability to combine research as well as advanced training, and its capacity to issue generally recognized certificates to those who have completed such training processes, are in more recent times increasingly discussed and are no longer correspondent to the sociological context. Consequently, the traditional model of university, based on a self-representation of its past, a self-legitimation of its functions, and a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>programmes</b> which autonomously defines the basic criteria for its decisions, appear connected to a temporal horizon more and more unsuitable to the emerging needs of a society dominated by different perceptions of time...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{providing}} a template {{of how to}} practice Continual Quality Improvement (CQI) in an Engineering Undergraduate Programme. At the inception <b>of</b> the <b>programme,</b> the academic curriculum {{is based upon the}} notion of the type of graduate an institution of higher learning would like to produce. Hence, a graduate of a particular institution embodies its vision and mission. Taking this further and to ensure specificity in the type of graduate produced, Engineering <b>Programmes</b> provide a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>Programme</b> Educational Objectives (PEOs) which are derived from the vision and mission. From these PEOs, the Programme Outcomes (POs) are crafted, followed by the Learning Outcomes (LOs) at the module level – and hence the appropriate curriculum is decided upon. Once the programme is in full implementation, there exists a need to monitor and control the PEOs, POs and LOs to ensure that the programme progresses and evolves. Herein lies the need to practice CQI at all three levels. The following paper will provide an emphasis of how CQI, implemented correctly can result in enhancing the overall student learning experience...|$|R

40|$|The {{object of}} this study was to {{estimate}} heritabilities and sire breeding values for stayability and reproductive traits in a composite multibreed beef cattle herd using a threshold model. A GFCAT <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>programmes</b> was used to analyse reproductive data. Heritabilities and product-moment correlations between predicted breeding values for stayability at 36, 48, 60, 72 and 84 months of age, calving success and longevity were estimated. The estimated heritabilities on the underlying scale for these traits were 0. 06, 0. 10, 0. 06, 0. 03, 0. 11, 0. 03 and 0. 08 respectively. Product-moment correlations between breeding values for stayability traits were low. The highest correlation of 0. 22 was obtained between the ages of 36 and 48 months. Heritability estimates and correlations between traits appear to be of such a low magnitude that selection for these characteristics would result in limited genetic improvement, and also indicate that sires had little influence on the stayability, longevity or calving success of their daughters.

40|$|Sound {{strategies}} for community {{water supply and}} sanitation programmes in developing countries should be based on a clear understanding of the existing problems, the beneficial impacts achievable, and the factors which determine sustainability. The impacts of many water and sanitation programmes are limited, and many systems break down and are abandoned prematurely. Only limited impacts are achievable in the short term without greatly increased investment. Sustainability, in the sense of continued delivery and uptake of services, is threatened by numerous attitudinal, institutional and economic factors, and community participation approaches alone are no guarantee of success. The key to sustainability is that all stakeholders involved in consumption/use, maintenance, cost recovery, and continuing support perceive it in their best interests to deliver high quality services. The paper proposes new <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>programme</b> aims and objectives in relation to impact and sustainability, which can be used in programme design, monitoring and evaluation.
