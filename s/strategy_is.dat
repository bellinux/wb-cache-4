5|$|The semi-natural, unfertilized {{pastures}} {{formed by}} traditional agricultural methods in Europe were managed by grazing and mowing. Because the ecological {{impact of this}} land management <b>strategy</b> <b>is</b> similar {{to the impact of}} such natural disturbances as a wildfire, this agricultural system shares many beneficial characteristics with a natural habitat, including the promotion of biodiversity. This <b>strategy</b> <b>is</b> declining in Europe today due to the intensification of agriculture. The mechanized and chemical methods used are causing biodiversity to decline.|$|E
5|$|Echolocating bats {{follow an}} infinity-point path when hunting insects in the dark. This {{is not for}} {{camouflage}} but for {{the efficiency of the}} resulting path, so the <b>strategy</b> <b>is</b> generally called constant absolute target direction (CATD); it is equivalent to CBDR but allowing for the target to manoeuvre erratically.|$|E
5|$|One <b>strategy</b> <b>is</b> to {{minimise}} actual motion, as when predators such as tigers stalk prey {{by moving}} very slowly and stealthily. This strategy effectively avoids {{the need to}} camouflage motion.|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} persecutory {{strategy}} refers to patterns {{of thinking and}} acting by social welfare offices towards parents and children. This report summarizes fourteen case studies. Approximately 10 - 100 <b>strategies</b> <b>were</b> found in each case. Some <b>strategies</b> <b>were</b> recurrent in numerous or all cases.

50|$|Companies {{typically}} use many strategies concurrently, some defensive, some offensive, {{and always}} some deterrents. According {{to the business}} literature of the period, offensive <b>strategies</b> <b>were</b> more important than defensive one. Defensive <b>strategies</b> <b>were</b> used when needed, but an offensive <b>strategy</b> <b>was</b> requisite. Only by offensive <b>strategies,</b> <b>were</b> market gains made.

5|$|Sperm whales {{can live}} 70 years or more.

5|$|A radical {{strategy}} for avoiding predators which may otherwise kill {{a large majority}} of the emerging young of a population is to emerge very rarely, at irregular intervals. This <b>strategy</b> <b>is</b> seen in dramatic form in the periodical cicadas, which emerge at intervals of 13 or 17 years. Predators with a life-cycle of one or a few years are unable to reproduce rapidly enough in response to such an emergence, so predator satiation is a likely evolutionary explanation for the cicadas' unusual life-cycle, though not the only one. Predators may still feast on the emerging cicadas, but are unable to consume more than a fraction of the brief surfeit of prey.|$|E
5|$|Anxious-ambivalent {{attachment}} is also misnamed as 'resistant attachment'. In general, a {{child with}} an anxious-ambivalent pattern of attachment will typically explore little (in the Strange Situation) and is often wary of strangers, even when the parent is present. When the mother departs, the child is often highly distressed. The child is generally ambivalent when she returns. The anxious-ambivalent <b>strategy</b> <b>is</b> a response to unpredictably responsive caregiving, and the displays of anger (ambivalent resistant) or helplessness (ambivalent passive) towards the caregiver on reunion {{can be regarded as}} a conditional strategy for maintaining the availability of the caregiver by preemptively taking control of the interaction.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} mammals, {{domestic}} sheep reproduction occurs sexually. Their reproductive <b>strategy</b> <b>is</b> {{very similar to}} other domestic herd animals. A flock of sheep is generally mated by a single ram, which has either been chosen by a farmer or has established dominance through physical contest with other rams (in feral populations). Most sheep have a breeding season (tupping) in the autumn, though some are able to breed year-round.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain and {{the entire}} {{subsequent}} government carries the blame not to have taken equivalent steps when they discovered Germany's preparations for war. A world power must always be prepared to successfully and energetically repulse any attack. Everyone is certain that England was not sufficiently prepared. Also the fleet did not appear capable of taking decisive action. It's possible that it was merely constraining itself, but that <b>strategy</b> <b>is</b> a mistake. It should have been put into action immediately. Neither in Africa nor in the Mediterranean has the English fleet rigorously counter-attacked.|$|E
5|$|Chess <b>strategy</b> <b>is</b> {{concerned}} with evaluation of chess positions and with setting up goals and long-term {{plans for the}} future play.

5|$|Taking Tiger Mountain (By <b>Strategy)</b> <b>is</b> a loose concept {{album with}} topics ranging from espionage to the Chinese Communist revolution. The album's music has an upbeat and bouncy sound but with dark lyrical themes. The album did not chart in the United Kingdom or the United States, but {{received}} greater {{attention from the}} rock press. It was reissued in a remastered version in 2004 by Virgin Records. The album has received critical attention, with varying opinions on its style and quality compared to Here Come the Warm Jets.|$|E
5|$|Taking Tiger Mountain (By <b>Strategy)</b> <b>is</b> {{the second}} solo album by English {{musician}} Brian Eno. Produced by Eno, {{it was originally}} released by Island Records in November 1974. Unlike his previous album Here Come the Warm Jets, Eno used a core band of five instrumentalists (keyboards, guitars, bass, drums and percussion) and used fewer guest musicians. Also participating was guitarist and co-writer Phil Manzanera, who had played with Eno in Roxy Music. To help guide {{the production of the}} album, Eno and Peter Schmidt developed instruction cards called Oblique Strategies to use through the creative process of the album.|$|E

40|$|Population model {{coefficients}} {{were chosen to}} simulate a saturated 2 to the 4 th fixed-effects experiment having an unfavorable distribution of relative values. Using random number studies, deletion <b>strategies</b> <b>were</b> compared that {{were based on the}} F-distribution, on an order statistics distribution of Cochran's, and on a combination of the two. The <b>strategies</b> <b>were</b> compared under the criterion of minimizing the maximum prediction error, wherever it occurred, among the two-level factorial points. The <b>strategies</b> <b>were</b> evaluated for each of the conditions of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 center points.

5|$|The {{second most}} {{prevalent}} hunting strategy observed is hover gleaning, {{in which the}} tit-tyrant flies upwards from its perch and then hovers midair while grabbing prey from the vegetation. A third and less frequently used <b>strategy</b> <b>is</b> flycatching, in which the bird flies away from its shrub to grab prey in midair. Prey can be grabbed either close to the bird's perch or at a short distance, which often requires the bird to pursue its prey. When pairs flycatch cooperatively, one bird quietly lurks within the shrub while the other snatches nearby insects; after about a dozen attacks, the birds switch positions.|$|E

5|$|These {{advantages}} {{offset the}} high stress, physical exertion costs, and other {{risks of the}} migration.
