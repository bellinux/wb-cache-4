5|$|Although silk {{was well}} known in Europe and most of Asia, China {{was able to keep}} a near {{monopoly}} on silk production. The monopoly was defended by an imperial decree, condemning to death anyone attempting to export silkworms or their eggs. Only around the year 300 CE did a Japanese expedition succeed in taking some silkworm eggs and four young Chinese girls, who were forced to teach their captors the art of <b>sericulture.</b> Techniques of <b>sericulture</b> were subsequently introduced to Japan on a larger scale by frequent diplomatic exchanges between the 8th century and 9th centuries.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of silk through <b>sericulture</b> was profitable for both small-time farmers and large-scale producers. Silk clothing {{was too expensive}} for the poor, who wore clothes most commonly made of hemp. The rural women usually wove all the family's clothes.|$|E
5|$|Though silk was {{exported}} to foreign countries in great amounts, <b>sericulture</b> remained {{a secret that}} the Chinese carefully guarded. Consequently, other peoples invented wildly varying accounts {{of the source of}} the incredible fabric.|$|E
5|$|Many establishments {{cater to}} the Indian army bases near the town, {{providing}} it with essential supplies. Small contributions to the economy come by {{the way of the}} sale of traditional arts and crafts of Sikkim and Tibet. Government efforts related to <b>sericulture,</b> seismology, and fisheries provide a steady source of employment to many of its residents.|$|E
5|$|Tipu Sultan is {{credited}} to have founded state trading depots in various locations of his kingdom. In addition, he founded depots in foreign locations such as Karachi, Jeddah and Muscat, where Mysore products were sold. During Tipu's rule French technology {{was used for}} the first time in carpentry and smithy, Chinese technology was used for sugar production, and technology from Bengal helped improve the <b>sericulture</b> industry. State factories were established in Kanakapura and Taramandelpeth for producing cannons and gunpowder respectively. The state held the monopoly in the production of essentials such as sugar, salt, iron, pepper, cardamom, betel nut, tobacco and sandalwood, as well as the extraction of incense oil from sandalwood and the mining of silver, gold and precious stones. Sandalwood was exported to China and the Persian Gulf countries and <b>sericulture</b> was developed in twenty-one centers within the kingdom.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, Provence {{experienced}} {{a boom in}} <b>sericulture</b> that would last until the first world war, {{with much of the}} silk shipped north to Lyon. Viens and La Bastide-des-Jourdans are two of the communes of Luberon that profited the most from mulberry plantations that have since disappeared. However, silk centers still operate today.Working at home under the domestic system, silk spinning and silk treatment employed many people and increased the income of the working class.|$|E
5|$|England under Henry IV {{was also}} looking {{to develop a}} silk industry, but no {{opportunity}} arose until the revocation of the Edict of Nantes the 1680s, when {{hundreds of thousands of}} French Huguenots, many of whom were skilled weavers and experts in <b>sericulture,</b> began immigrating to England to escape religious persecution. Some areas, including Spitalfields saw many high-quality silk workshops spring up, their products distinct from continental silk largely by the colors used. Nonetheless, the British climate prevented England's domestic silk trade from becoming globally dominant.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the crisis}} in Europe, the {{modernization}} of <b>sericulture</b> in Japan made it the world's foremost silk producer. By the early 20th century, rapidly industrializing Japan was producing as much as 60 percent of the world's raw silk, most exports shipping through the port of Yokohama. Italy managed to rebound from the crisis, but France was unable. Urbanization in Europe saw many French and Italian agricultural workers leave silk growing for more lucrative factory work. Raw silk was imported from Japan to fill the void. Asian countries, formerly exporters of raw materials (cocoons and raw silk), progressively began to export more and more finished garments.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sericulture,</b> the rearing of silkworms, {{was first}} {{adopted by the}} Chinese during the Shang dynasty. The only species farmed commercially is the domesticated silkmoth. When it spins its cocoon, each larva {{produces}} an exceedingly long, slender thread of silk. The larvae feed on mulberry leaves and in Europe, only one generation is normally raised each year as this is a deciduous tree. In China, Korea and Japan however, two generations are normal, and in the tropics, multiple generations are expected. Most production of silk occurs in the Far East, with a synthetic diet being used to rear the silkworms in Japan.|$|E
5|$|Sericulture: <b>Sericulture</b> is the {{production}} of silk from silkworms. The oldest silk found in China comes from the Chinese Neolithic period and is dated to about 3630 BC, found in Henan province. Silk items excavated from the Liangzhu culture site at Qianshanyang, Wuxing District, Zhejiang date to roughly 2570 BC, and include silk threads, a braided silk belt {{and a piece of}} woven silk. A bronze fragment found at the Shang Dynasty (c. 1600– c. 1050 BC) site at Anyang (or Yinxu) contains the first known written reference to silk.|$|E
5|$|She {{then had}} the idea to weave some of it, so she kept some for herself. Having {{observed}} {{the life of the}} silk worm on the recommendation of her husband, the Yellow Emperor, she began to instruct her entourage in the art of raising silk worms, <b>sericulture.</b> From this point, the girl became the goddess of silk in Chinese mythology. Silk eventually left China via the heir of a princess who was promised to a prince of Khotan. This probably occurred in the early 1st century CE. The princess, refusing to go without the fabric that she loved, would finally break the imperial ban on silk-worm exportation.|$|E
5|$|More {{information}} {{is known about}} the looms used. The Nung Sang Chi Yao, or Fundamentals of Agriculture and <b>Sericulture,</b> compiled around 1210, is rich with pictures and descriptions, many pertaining to silk. It repeatedly claims the Chinese looms to be far superior to all others. It speaks of two types of loom that leave the worker's arms free: the draw loom, which is of Eurasian origin, and the pedal loom which is attributed to East Asian origins. There are many diagrams originate in the 12th and 13th centuries. When examined closely, many similarities between Eurasian machines can be drawn. Since the Jin dynasty, the existence of silk damasks has been well recorded, and since the 2nd century BCE, four-shafted looms and other innovations allowed the creation of silk brocades.|$|E
5|$|Silk {{cultivation}} {{spread to}} Japan around 300 CE, and, by 522 CE, the Byzantines managed to obtain silkworm eggs {{and were able}} to begin silkworm cultivation. The Arabs also began to manufacture silk during this same time. As a result of the spread of <b>sericulture,</b> Chinese silk exports became less important, although they still maintained dominance over the luxury silk market. The Crusades brought silk production to Western Europe, in particular to many Italian states, which saw an economic boom exporting silk to the rest of Europe. Changes in manufacturing techniques also began to take place during the Middle Ages, with devices such as the spinning wheel first appearing. During the 16th century France joined Italy in developing a successful silk trade, though the efforts of most other nations to develop a silk industry of their own were unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|The encyclopedist Song Yingxing (1587–1666) {{documented}} a {{wide array}} of technologies, metallurgic and industrial processes in his Tiangong Kaiwu encyclopedia of 1637. This includes mechanical and hydraulic powered devices for agriculture and irrigation, nautical technology such as vessel types and snorkeling gear for pearl divers, the annual processes of <b>sericulture</b> and weaving with the loom, metallurgic processes such as the crucible technique and quenching, manufacturing processes such as for roasting iron pyrite in converting sulphide to oxide in sulfur used in gunpowder compositions – illustrating how ore was piled up with coal briquettes in an earthen furnace with a still-head that sent over sulfur as vapor that would solidify and crystallize – and the use of gunpowder weapons such as a naval mine ignited by use of a rip-cord and steel flint wheel.|$|E
5|$|Many {{scholars}} who needed additional funds for education or vied for political office found farming as a decent profession which, although humble, was not {{looked down upon}} by fellow gentrymen. Wealthy nobles, officials, and merchants could own land, but they often did not cultivate it themselves and merely acted as absentee landlords while living in the city. They mostly relied on poor tenant farmers (diannong 佃農) who paid rent {{in the form of}} roughly fifty percent of their produce in exchange for land, tools, draft animals, and a small house. Wage laborers (gunong 雇農) and slaves were also employed on the estates of the wealthy, although they were not as numerous as tenants. During Western Han, the small independent owner-cultivator represented the majority of farming peasants, yet their economic struggle to remain independent during times of war, natural disaster and crisis drove many into debt, banditry, slavery, and dramatically increased the number of landless tenants by late Eastern Han. The social status of poor independent owner-cultivators was above tenants and wage laborers, yet below that of wealthy landowners. While wealthy landowners employed tenants and wage laborers, landowners who managed small to medium-sized estates often acted as managers over their sons who tilled the fields and daughters who weaved clothes and engaged in <b>sericulture</b> to produce silk for the home or sale at market.|$|E
25|$|The Emperors of China {{strove to}} keep {{knowledge}} of <b>sericulture</b> secret {{to maintain the}} Chinese monopoly. Nonetheless <b>sericulture</b> reached Korea with technological aid from China around 200 BC the ancient Kingdom of Khotan by AD 50, and India by AD 140.|$|E

25|$|In Terengganu, {{which is}} now part of Malaysia, a second {{generation}} of silkworm was being imported as early as 1764 for the country's silk textile industry, especially songket. However, since the 1980s, Malaysia is no longer engaged in <b>sericulture</b> but does plant mulberry trees.|$|E

India's definition of services sector includes its construction, retail, software, IT, communications, hospitality, infrastructure operations, education, health care, banking and insurance, {{and many other}} economic activities.|$|E
25|$|Trabzon {{produced}} a white green bean, which {{was sold in}} Europe. It was, as of 1920, the only vegetable exported out of the province. Poultry farming was also popular in Trabzon. <b>Sericulture</b> {{was seen in the}} area before 1914. The area produced copper, silver, zinc, iron and manganese. Copper was kept for local use by coppersmiths. During the Balkan Wars production ceased due to poor exportation and fuel supplies.|$|E
25|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{agricultural development}} program {{is beginning to}} take effect. The prefecture is now a commercial base for edible fungi, dried and fresh fruit, bamboo and bamboo shoots, tea, commercial forest, oil tea, <b>sericulture,</b> herb medicine, vegetable and nuts. Products like shiitake mushrooms, tree fungus, Huiming tea, white pond lily, day lily, sun-cured tobacco, and orange and oil tea are produced in large quantities and are well known throughout Zhejiang.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} silk {{production}} {{is known as}} <b>sericulture.</b> The entire production process of silk {{can be divided into}} several steps which are typically handled by different entities. Extracting raw silk starts by cultivating the silkworms on mulberry leaves. Once the worms start pupating in their cocoons, these are dissolved in boiling water in order for individual long fibres to be extracted and fed into the spinning reel.|$|E
25|$|Rafiyev {{was born}} on 22 March 1915 in Ordubad to a working-class family. After nine years of {{studying}} at the <b>sericulture</b> courses in Tbilisi, he returned to Ordubad {{and worked as a}} senior inspector at the cocoon-seed station. He moved to Baku in 1931. Rafiyev graduated from trade school and then railway technical school. In 1935, he was drafted into the Red Army and sent to the armored forces. He graduated from the Leningrad Higher Armored School in 1941.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sericulture,</b> the {{practice}} of breeding silkworms {{for the production of}} raw silk, has been under way for at least 5,000 years in China, from where it spread to Korea and Japan, India and later the West. The silkworm was domesticated from the wild silkmoth Bombyx mandarina, which has a range from northern India to northern China, Korea, Japan, and the far eastern regions of Russia. The domesticated silkworm derives from Chinese rather than Japanese or Korean stock.|$|E
25|$|Jammu and Kashmir's {{economy is}} {{predominantly}} dependent on agriculture and allied activities. The Kashmir Valley {{is known for}} its <b>sericulture</b> and cold-water fisheries. Wood from Kashmir is used to make high-quality cricket bats, popularly known as Kashmir Willow. Kashmiri saffron is very famous and brings the state a handsome amount of foreign exchange. Agricultural exports from Jammu and Kashmir include apples, barley, cherries, corn, millet, oranges, rice, peaches, pears, saffron, sorghum, vegetables, and wheat, while manufactured exports include handicrafts, rugs, and shawls.|$|E
25|$|As {{the process}} of {{harvesting}} the silk from the cocoon kills the larvae by boiling them, <b>sericulture</b> has been criticized by animal welfare and rights activists. Mohandas Gandhi was critical of silk production based on the Ahimsa philosophy which led to promotion of cotton and Ahimsa silk, a type of wild silk made from the cocoons of wild and semi-wild silk moths. Since silk cultivation kills silkworms, possibly painfully, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) urges people not to buy silk items.|$|E
25|$|Silk is {{a natural}} protein fiber, some forms {{of which can be}} woven into textiles. The protein fiber of silk is {{composed}} mainly of fibroin and is produced by certain insect larvae to form cocoons. The best-known silk is obtained from the cocoons of the larvae of the mulberry silkworm Bombyx mori reared in captivity (<b>sericulture).</b> The shimmering appearance of silk is due to the triangular prism-like structure of the silk fibre, which allows silk cloth to refract incoming light at different angles, thus producing different colors.|$|E
25|$|As empress, she is {{particularly}} responsible for Momijiyama Imperial Cocoonery, a <b>sericulture</b> farm {{on the grounds}} of the imperial palace. She participates in the annual ceremony of harvesting silk, personally feeds silkworms with blackberries and is responsible to take care of them, the frames, and the harvesting. The production and harvesting of silk are part of her ceremonial duties, linked to Shintoism, Japanese culture, and tradition. Since 1994, the Empress offers a part of the harvested silk of the koishimaru variety (the oldest species now kept in Japan) to the Shōsōin Treasure-house in the Buddhist temple Tōdai-ji in Nara to be used for the restoration of its treasures.|$|E

25|$|The {{economy of}} the Second Bulgarian Empire was based on agriculture, mining, {{traditional}} crafts, and trade. Agriculture and livestock breeding remained the mainstays of the Bulgarian economy between the 12th and 14th centuries. Moesia, Zagore, and Dobrudzha were known for rich harvests of grain, including high quality wheat. Production of wheat, barley, and millet was also developed in most regions of Thrace. The main wine-producing areas were Thrace, the Black Sea coast, and the valleys of the Struma and Vardar rivers in Macedonia. Production of vegetables, orchards, and grapes became increasingly important {{since the beginning of}} the 13th century. The existence of large forests and pastures was favorable for livestock breeding, mainly in the mountainous and semi-mountainous regions of the country. <b>Sericulture</b> and especially apiculture were well developed. Honey and wax from Zagore were the best-quality bee products in the Byzantine markets and were highly praised. The forests produced wood for cutting (бранища); there were also fenced forests (забели), in which wood-cutting was banned.|$|E
