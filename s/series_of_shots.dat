5|$|There {{was a pause}} of {{uncertain}} length (eyewitness estimates {{ranged from}} several seconds to two minutes), after which the soldiers fired into the crowd. Rather than a disciplined volley (Preston gave no orders to fire), a ragged <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>shots</b> was fired, which hit eleven men. Three Americans—ropemaker Samuel Gray, mariner James Caldwell, and Crispus Attucks—died instantly. Samuel Maverick, an apprentice ivory turner of seventeen, {{was struck by a}} ricocheting musket ball {{at the back of the}} crowd, and died a few hours later, in the early morning of the next day. An Irish immigrant, Patrick Carr, died two weeks later. Christopher Monk, another apprentice, was one of those seriously wounded in the attack. Although he recovered to some extent, he was crippled and eventually died in 1780, purportedly due to the injuries he had sustained in the attack a decade earlier.|$|E
5|$|The {{collapse}} left Barnett and captain Yardley {{as the new}} men at the crease. Both players {{attacked the}} bowling but could not get their shots through the field for runs. Soon after, Lindwall {{was forced to leave}} the field due to a groin injury and did not bowl again. Barnett hit one four before Johnston bowled him for eight off the inside edge as he leaned onto the front foot. This brought Evans to the crease with the score at 60/6, and he attempted to disrupt the Australians' line and length by counter-attacking with a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>shots</b> in front of the wicket. He drove the ball forward of point to the boundary for four, and was then given two lives. He hit Johnston hard to cover, but the catch went through Bradman for another boundary. The second chance of a catch went through Bradman's hand and struck the Australian captain in the abdomen. However, the missed opportunities cost the tourists little; Evans hit a ball strongly but it was caught at close range at short leg by Morris. Without further addition to the score, Toshack trapped Yardley, who had lingered at the crease for 26 minutes in accumulating three runs, leg before wicket (lbw) with a ball that straightened after pitching, leaving the score at 74/8.|$|E

The referee called a stop to the contest in the 7th round after Rahman {{failed to respond to}} a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>shots.</b>|$|E
25|$|Serra {{has made}} a number of films {{concerning}} the manufacture and use of his favorite material, steel. Railroad Turnbridge (1976) is a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>shots</b> taken on the Burlington and Northern bridge over the Willamette River near Portland, Oregon, as it opens to let a ship pass. In Steelmill/Stahlwerk, a 1979 documentary made in collaboration with Clara Weyergraf, Serra explores the physical construction of an art piece {{and at the same time}} examines the lives of the steelmill. These films can be viewed in a room off the Arcelor gallery in the Guggenheim museum in Bilbao.|$|E
25|$|To prevent canine distemper, puppies {{should begin}} {{vaccination}} at {{six to eight}} weeks of age and then continue getting the “booster shot” every two to four weeks until they are 16 weeks of age. Without the full <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>shots,</b> the vaccination will not provide protection against the virus. Since puppies are typically sold at the age of eight to ten weeks, they typically receive the first shot while still with their breeder, but the new owner often does not finish the series. These dogs are not protected against the virus and so are susceptible to canine distemper infection, continuing the downward spiral that leads to outbreaks throughout the country.|$|E

500|$|According to Hitchcock, a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>shots</b> with Arbogast {{going up}} the stairs in the Bates house before he is stabbed were helmed by {{assistant}} director Hilton A. Green, working with storyboard artist Saul Bass' drawings only while Hitchcock was incapacitated with the common cold. However, upon viewing the dailies of the shots, Hitchcock was forced to scrap them. He claimed they were [...] "no good" [...] {{because they did not}} portray [...] "an innocent person but a sinister man who was going up those stairs". Hitchcock later re-shot the scene, though a little of the cut footage made its way into the film. Filming the murder of Arbogast proved problematic owing to the overhead camera angle necessary to hide the film's twist. A camera track constructed on pulleys alongside the stairway together with a chairlike device had to be constructed and thoroughly tested over a period of weeks.|$|E
500|$|It {{starts with}} a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>shots</b> {{displaying}} Rihanna wearing a black eye-patch, a high-necked jacket and suspenders, and was filmed in {{a black and white}} grainy fashion, whilst Rihanna recites the lyrics [...] "The wait is ova". Scenes are then intercut with shots of Rihanna wearing a black hooded top, in {{what appears to be a}} Church, which is followed by Rihanna changing outfits, again wearing a black bra top and a fur coat sitting on a pair of Angel's wings for the chorus. For the bridge of the song, Rihanna is featured in yet another change of outfit, this time wearing a white vest top and black fur coat, standing on the roof top of a New York skyscraper, with other tall buildings in the background. As Rihanna sings the final chorus, scenes from throughout the video are intercut with each other, with the new addition of Rihanna shown to be wearing what she wore at the start of the video in an underpass.|$|E
500|$|Whale {{was known}} for his use of camera movement. He is {{credited}} with being the first director to use a 360-degree panning shot in a feature film, included in Frankenstein. Whale used a similar technique during the Ol' Man River sequence in Show Boat, in which the camera tracked around Paul Robeson as he sang the song. (The sequence also uses expressionist montages illustrating some of the lyrics.) Often singled out for praise in Frankenstein is the <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>shots</b> used to introduce the Monster: [...] "Nothing can ever quite efface the thrill of watching the successive views Whale's mobile camera allows us of the lumbering figure". These shots, starting with a medium shot and culminating in two close-ups of the Monster's face, were repeated by Whale to introduce Griffin in The Invisible Man and the abusive husband in One More River. Modified to a single cut rather than two, Whale uses the same technique in The Road Back to signal the instability of a returning World War I veteran.|$|E

500|$|For the CGI used {{throughout}} the film, companies Rhythm & Hues (R) and Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) developed {{different parts of the}} film. R focused on the animation of the animals, while ILM completed the final scene of the ark rushing through Washington D.C. Lindy De Quattro, the ILM associate visual effects supervisor, revealed that [...] "This is the first time where we had to do a whole <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>shots</b> that were happening mid-day, where {{you were going to get}} a really long look at the water and what it was doing." [...] The company initially experienced problems creating the water effects and had to develop new tools which would choreograph the movements of the water. In addition, ILM used similar tools that were used on their prior film Poseidon. Lighting was also an issue as the characters on the ark had been filmed on a greenscreen stage, and the visual effects company had to ensure that the lighting matched that of the characters and the outside setting. Details were added to the ark for long-distance shots to make the design of the ark more appealing and relate the ark's size to scale in comparison to the amount of water. To complete the scene, ILM used thirty to sixty crew members and produced 200 shots over a yearlong period between April 2006 and May 2007.|$|E
500|$|Each episode {{begins with}} a cold open that seldom {{contains}} a dramatic juncture. The screen then fades or cuts to black while the intro music fades in. The show's opening title sequence then plays; a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>shots,</b> mainly close-ups, concerning the show's subject matter that changes from season to season, separated by fast cutting (a technique rarely used in the show itself). The opening credits are superimposed on the sequence, and consist only of actors' names without identifying which actors play which roles. In addition, actors' faces are rarely seen in the title sequence. At {{the end of the}} sequence, a quotation is shown on-screen that is spoken by a character during the episode. The three exceptions were the first season finale which uses the phrase [...] "All in the game", attributed to [...] "Traditional West Baltimore", a phrase used frequently throughout all five seasons including that episode; the fourth season finale which uses words written on boarded up vacant homes attributed to [...] "Baltimore, traditional" [...] and the series finale, which started with a quote from H. L. Mencken that is shown on a wall at The Baltimore Sun in one scene, neither quote being spoken by a character. Progressive story arcs often unfold in different locations at the same time. Episodes rarely end with a cliffhanger, and close with a fade or cut to black with the closing music fading in.|$|E
500|$|Jeremy Egner of The New York Times also {{praised the}} {{direction}} of the King's Landing story, and Lena Headey's portrayal of Cersei, saying in his review [...] "Ms. Headey's performance was but one element in a sequence that, technically, ranks among the show's best. Miguel Sapochnik, who directed last week's battle-heavy episode, brought a different kind of precision and urgency to Sunday's installment. Cersei's scheme unspooled amid insistent strings and a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>shots</b> — those vicious little birds taking out Pycelle, Lancel and the dwindling candle-fuse, Margaery's growing concern and rising tension in the Sept — that built inexorably to the High Sparrow's realization that he wasn't as smart as he thought." [...] James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly stated he felt the episode introduced new conflicts to look forward to in the next season, saying [...] "Though the finale shifted from the battlefield, the events were, if anything, far more seismic, with game-changing revelations and huge moves from every corner of the realm that established some very clear new conflicts going into season 7." [...] Sarah Larson of The New Yorker wrote in her review, [...] "It's a beautiful image. Boats, clouds, sun, dragons, and two female ship captains, pointing their armada toward a Westeros ruled by a queen." [...] James Hunt of WhatCulture wrote in his review, [...] "What a way to go out. Season 6 has already proved to be a great season of TV, but it saved its best for last." [...] Tim Surette of TV.com called the episode, [...] "the best episode ever." [...] Brian Lowry of CNN wrote in his review for the episode, [...] "At this point it's hard to second-guess producers David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, who, working with Martin, have created a series for the ages." [...] Willa Paskin of Slate wrote in his review, [...] "Revenge, a dish Game of Thrones has almost always made taste awful, served hot or cold, became, in the finale, a delicacy. [...] " ...|$|E

500|$|Aside from {{experts and}} {{security}} personnel, several eyewitnesses gave {{evidence to the}} inquest. Three witnessed parts of the shootings, and gave accounts which supported the official version of events—in particular, they did not witness the SAS shooting any of the suspects while {{they were on the}} floor. Witnesses uncovered by the journalists making [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] also appeared: Stephen Bullock repeated his account of seeing McCann and Savage raise their hands before the SAS shot them; Josie Celecia repeated her account of seeing a soldier shooting at McCann and Farrell while the pair were on the ground. Hucker pointed out that parts of Celecia's testimony had changed since she spoke to [...] "Death on the Rock", and suggested that the gunfire she heard was from the shooting of Savage rather than sustained shooting of McCann and Farrell while they were on the ground, a suggestion Celecia rejected; the SAS's lawyer further observed that she was unable to identify the military personnel in photographs her husband had taken. Maxie Proetta told the coroner that he had witnessed four men (three in plain clothes and one uniformed Gibraltar Police officer) arriving opposite the petrol station on Winston Churchill Avenue; the men jumped over the central reservation barrier and Farrell put her hands up, after which he heard a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>shots.</b> In contrast to his wife's testimony, he believed that Farrell's gesture was one of self-defence rather than surrender, and he believed that the shots he heard did not come from the men from the police car. The government lawyers suggested that the police car the Proettas saw was the one being driven by Inspector Revagliatte, carrying four uniformed police officers rather than plain-clothed soldiers, but Proetta was adamant that the lawyers' version did not make sense. His wife gave evidence the following day. Contrary to her statement to [...] "Death on the Rock", Carmen Proetta was no longer certain that she had seen McCann and Farrell shot while on the ground. The government lawyers questioned the reliability of Proetta's evidence based on her changes, and implied that she behaved suspiciously by giving evidence to [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] before the police. She responded that the police had not spoken to her about the shootings until after [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] had been shown.|$|E
500|$|Maxie Proetta {{appeared}} on 22 September.

The government lawyers suggested that the police car {{he and his wife had}} seen was one seen by other eyewitnesses further south, and that it was responding to the shootings rather than transporting soldiers, but Mr Proetta was adamant that the lawyers' suggestion did not make sense. Carmen Proetta appeared the following day. Mrs Proetta's testimony contained some discrepancies with the evidence she gave to [...] "Death on the Rock"; she was no longer certain that she had seen the SAS shoot McCann and Savage while the latter were on the ground, because she could not recall seeing shell casings being ejected from the soldiers' weapons. The government lawyers questioned the reliability of Proetta's evidence based on her changes, and implied that she behaved suspiciously by giving evidence to [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] before the police. She responded that the police had not spoken to her about the shootings until after [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] had been shown. Asquez, who provided an unsworn statement to the programme through an intermediary, reluctantly appeared at the inquest. He retracted the statements he had given to the journalists, which he claimed he had made up after [...] "pestering" [...] from Major Bob Randall (who had sold the programme a video recording of the aftermath of the shootings). The British tabloids covered Asquez's retraction extensively, while several members of parliament accused [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] of manipulating Asquez in an attempt to discredit the SAS and the British government. However, Asquez's statement contained several details that were not released publicly, and which only entered the public domain during the inquest, though, when questioned by the coroner, Asquez said he could not explain the discrepancy because he was [...] "a bit confused". The inquest concluded on 30 September and the jury returned a verdict of lawful killing.|$|E

2500|$|The demon {{was also}} {{designed}} to have dark gray skin, which presented the crew {{a challenge in}} the film's dark settings. Tippett's Blair Clark said, [...] "We played the skin like a rotten mummy: nothing too moist, {{with a lot of}} wear marks on it." [...] The crew's final visual effects shot was the death of the demon, and they researched previous films and terminology for how demons' deaths have been designed. They drew inspiration from Hellboy (2004) where they focused on the buildup to the demon's death. Clark said, [...] "We built it over a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>shots</b> so it doesn't just happen in one shot. We had little patches on the demon that start to crack and result in a glow that looks like it's burning from within." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{performing}} such {{a sequence}} {{proved to be}} very dangerous. If one person crashes with the other, {{it could lead to}} the disproportion of the flight pattern and subsequently could result in death. Due to this, safety became a top priority for Core. Prior to shooting, the stuntmen went to the location, and to other locations which were similar, to start training in groups. In order to get comfortable with the wingtip-to-wingtip flights necessary to pull the scene off, the wingsuiters initially jumped from planes, racking up more than 500 jumps {{over the course of the}} year leading up to filming. They would fly in tight formations over and over again, simply as a way of getting accustomed to the idea of having someone nearby at all times. The production team also went to Switzerland 12 days prior to shooting to practice. [...] During the shoot, there were ground-based cameras with long lenses, and a helicopter with a gyro-stabilized camera as well. Since Core needed a <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>shots</b> to create the sequence, from point of view shots to profile shots of the wingsuiters cruising past the mountain to close-ups – unlike filming GoPro cameras – one of the wingsuiters needed to wear a cinema-quality camera on his head, rather than a GoPro. The task went to Florez and Boole, who had never done camera work before. The Red camera used in the flights weighed an astounding 15 pounds, enough to significantly alter the way pilots normally flew. The wingsuiters made over 60 jumps in the course of two weeks to get all the shots. Corliss called it the most dangerous stunt that has ever been filmed for a movie.|$|E
