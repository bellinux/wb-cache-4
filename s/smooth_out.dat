5|$|M-204 {{was first}} {{designated}} on July 12, 1933 between Leland and Suttons Bay along what is today Duck Lake Road. The highway was paved {{by the middle}} of 1936. The road was realigned on July 13, 1939, across the narrows of Lake Leelanau in the village of the same name. Another realignment near Suttons Bay was completed on March 26, 1956, to <b>smooth</b> <b>out</b> a curve in the road. A second completed on May 4, 1956, straightened a curve by Sylt Road east of Lake Leelanau. The western section was completely rebuilt between Duck Lake Corner and the Lake Leelanau Narrows Bridge to <b>smooth</b> <b>out</b> curves in the roadway. Sections not obliterated by the reconstruction were turned over to local control as Main Street or Old M-204 in Lake Leelanau when the project was finished on July 1, 1970.|$|E
5|$|After a {{company-wide}} {{contest to}} name the aircraft, the initial prototype received the name Pirate and made its first flight on 2 October 1946. Flight testing revealed severe aerodynamic problems, mostly caused by the airfoil section and thickness of the wing. The vertical stabilizer also had to be redesigned to <b>smooth</b> <b>out</b> the airflow {{at the intersection of}} the horizontal and vertical stabilizers. Other changes included the addition of dive brakes {{on the sides of the}} fuselage and the replacement of the Metalite panels near the engine's exhaust with stainless steel ones.|$|E
5|$|M-26 {{starts at}} an {{intersection}} with US45 east of Rockland in Michigan's Ontonagon County. From there it {{runs through the}} town of Mass City to the junction with M-38 east of Greenland. The two highways join for a short distance before M-26 separates turning northeast to Winona across the Houghton County line. In Twin Lakes M-26 passes {{the shores of the}} namesake lakes and Twin Lakes State Park. M-26 passes through wooded, hilly terrain in western Houghton County. The segment of roadway in South Range was recently realigned to <b>smooth</b> <b>out</b> curves in the roadway. From there north, M-26 runs generally downhill on approaching the western business district of Houghton and the Portage Lake Lift Bridge from the west.|$|E

5|$|M-49 {{was added}} to the state highway system in 1930, running along its current routing between M-9 (now M-99) in Litchfield and the Ohio state line south of Camden. Near the state line, the highway jogged along Territorial Road for a short {{distance}} to make the connection with the continuation of SR49. The second version of M-120 ran concurrently with M-49 on this section of Territorial Road starting in 1939. This concurrency was removed in late 1946 or early 1947 when M-49 was realigned to <b>smooth</b> <b>out</b> the corners in the roadway at M-120. The routing of M-49 has remained the same since. It is currently the only state highway that connects with a like-numbered state highway from another state. The only other highways in Michigan to share a number with a cross-border connection are components of the Interstate Highway System or the United States Numbered Highways.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{back in the}} restaurant, the {{waitress}} returns to find the woman missing. Believing that the woman has left without paying the bill, she angrily crumples and throws the woman's comic book into a bin. This makes the hero's two opposing racers reappear, armed with a large pipe wrench. The racers smash the looking glass with the pipe wrench, trapping {{the woman in the}} comic book. The hero punches one of the thugs and retreats with the woman into a maze of paper. Arriving at a dead end, he tears a hole in the paper wall so that the woman can escape as the menacing opposing racers close in on him. The woman, now back in the real world and found lying beside the bin to the surprise of restaurant guests and staff, retrieves the comic from the bin and runs home, where she attempts to <b>smooth</b> <b>out</b> the creases to learn what happens next.|$|E
5|$|When the US Highway System {{was formed}} on November 11, 1926, US141 ran from Milwaukee to Green Bay, and one {{segment of the}} modern highway in Michigan was {{originally}} designated US102. This other designation was decommissioned in 1928 when US141 was extended north from Green Bay into Michigan. Michigan has rebuilt the highway in stages {{over the years to}} <b>smooth</b> <b>out</b> sharp curves in the routing. Since the 1960s, the section south of Green Bay has been converted into a freeway in segments. US141 has ended southeast of Green Bay in Bellevue since the 1980s—the southern freeway segment was redesignated as I-43. The section north of Abrams, Wisconsin, was converted to a freeway in the opening years of the 21st century, with an additional divided-highway section opening a few years later.|$|E

5|$|In early 2015, the two again began {{showing signs}} of tension between them - with Stardust {{becoming}} further entrenched in his gimmick, leaving Goldust to {{have to try to}} communicate with his brother, Cody; through his new entity. Stardust would respond to this by walking out on Goldust before their match had concluded on the February 5 episode of SmackDown. On the February 16th edition of Raw - {{for the first time since}} their debut, Dusty Rhodes returned to speak to his sons as a way to commiserate and <b>smooth</b> <b>out</b> the problems they were having. Though at first Cody seemed to be in agreement with his family, after Goldust took the loss for his team against The New Day, Stardust hit his old finisher Cross-Rhodes thus dissolving their partnership entirely. After, when Dusty approached Stardust backstage, Stardust claimed that it was he and his brother that were responsible for the pressure Cody was subjected to from a young age. He then stated that Cody, and now his own family, were dead to him. A match between the two was set for Fastlane with Goldust promising to vanquish Stardust once and for all and to reclaim his brother and rekindle their partnership and brotherhood. Due to their father asking Goldust not to cause any real harm to Cody, Goldust won their first encounter via roll-up. Backstage, Stardust viciously assaulted Goldust and again proclaimed it was his family's fault for his mental decline.|$|E

25|$|By 1950, {{a second}} wave of bebop musicians—such as Clifford Brown and Sonny Stitt—began to <b>smooth</b> <b>out</b> the rhythmic eccentricities of early bebop. Instead of using jagged phrasing to create rhythmic interest, as the early boppers had, these musicians {{constructed}} their improvised lines out of long strings of eighth notes and simply accented certain notes in the line to create rhythmic variety.|$|E
25|$|The {{engine was}} a Rolls-Royce Merlin 47 driving a {{four-bladed}} Rotol propeller of 10ft 9 in (3.27 m) diameter; the new propeller provided increased power at high altitudes, where {{the atmosphere is}} much thinner. To help <b>smooth</b> <b>out</b> airflow around the wingtips the standard rounded types were replaced by extended, pointed versions extending the wingspan to 40ft 2 in (12.2 m). Otherwise the wings were Type B.|$|E

25|$|Glaciers {{grow and}} shrink due both to natural {{variability}} and external forcings.

25|$|An anecdote {{often told}} of Zwicky {{concerns}} an informal experiment {{to see if}} he could reduce problems with turbulence hindering an observation session one night at Mount Wilson observatory.

No effect was noticed, but the event shows the kind of lateral thinking for which Zwicky was famous.|$|E

25|$|There are two {{varieties}} of Kennedy half {{dollars in the}} proof set issues of 1964. Initially, the die was used with accented hair, showing deeper lines than the president's widow, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, liked. New dies were prepared to <b>smooth</b> <b>out</b> some of the details. It is estimated that about 1 to 3% (40,000 to 100,000) of the proof halves are of the earlier type, making them somewhat more expensive for collectors.|$|E
