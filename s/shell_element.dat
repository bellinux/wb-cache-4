40|$|International audienceThis article, a {{companion}} to the article by Philippe G. Ciarlet on the mathematical modelling of shells also {{in this issue of}} Acta Numerica, focuses on numerical issues raised by the analysis of <b>shells.</b> Finite <b>element</b> procedures are widely used in engineering practice to analyse the behaviour of shell structures. However, the concept of 'shell finite element' is still somewhat fuzzy, as it may correspond to very different ideas and techniques in various actual implementations. In particular, a significant distinction can be made between <b>shell</b> <b>elements</b> that are obtained via the discretization of shell models, and <b>shell</b> <b>elements</b> - such as the general <b>shell</b> <b>elements</b> - derived from 3 D formulations using some kinematic assumptions, without the use of any shell theory. Our first objective in this paper is to give a unified perspective of these two families of <b>shell</b> <b>elements.</b> This is expected to be very useful as it paves the way for further thorough mathematical analyses of <b>shell</b> <b>elements.</b> A particularly important motivation for this is the understanding and treatment of the deficiencies associated with the analysis of thin shells (among which is the locking phenomenon). We then survey these deficiencies, in the framework of the asymptotic behaviour of shell models. We conclude the article by giving some detailed guidelines to numerically assess the performance of <b>shell</b> finite <b>elements</b> when faced with these pathological phenomena, which is essential for the design of improved procedures...|$|R
50|$|The {{deflection}} {{distance of}} a member under a load {{is directly related to}} the slope of the deflected shape of the member under that load, and can be calculated by integrating the function that mathematically describes the slope of the member under that load. Deflection can be calculated by standard formula (will only give the deflection of common beam configurations and load cases at discrete locations), or by methods such as virtual work, direct integration, Castigliano's method, Macaulay's method or the direct stiffness method, amongst others. The deflection of beam elements is usually calculated on the basis of the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation while that of a plate or <b>shell</b> <b>element</b> is calculated using plate or shell theory.|$|E

40|$|AbstractLarge-scale {{thin-walled}} structures {{with a low}} weight-to-stiffness ratio {{provide the}} means for cost and energy efficiency in structural design. However, the design of such structures for crash and impact resistance requires reliable FE simulations. Large <b>shell</b> <b>elements</b> are used in those simulations. Simulations require {{the knowledge of the}} true stress–strain response of the material until fracture initiation. Because of the size effects, local material relation determined with experiments is not applicable to large <b>shell</b> <b>elements.</b> Therefore, a numerical method is outlined to determine the effect of element size on the macroscopic response of large structural <b>shell</b> <b>elements</b> until fracture initiation. Macroscopic response is determined by introducing averaging unit into the numerical model over which volume averaged equivalent stress and plastic strain are evaluated. Three different stress states are considered in this investigation: uniaxial, plane strain and equi-biaxial tension. The results demonstrate that fracture strain is highly sensitive to size effects in uniaxial tension whereas in plane strain or equi-biaxial tension size effects are much weaker. In uniaxial and plane strain tension the fracture strain for large <b>shell</b> <b>elements</b> approaches the Swift diffuse necking condition...|$|R
40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{carrying}} out topology optimization of shell structures, we show that it is advantageous to use <b>shell</b> <b>elements</b> based on a classical shell theory (such as the Cosserat theory) rather than elements based on the degenerated solid approach, since the shell thickness appears explicitly in the formulation, thereby greatly simplifying the sensitivity analysis. One of the well-known <b>shell</b> <b>elements</b> based on the Cosserat shell theory is the four-node element presented by Simo et al. [Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg. 72 (1989) 267; 73 (1989) 53]. Although one could use this element, the use of lower-order elements often results in instabilities (such as the "checkerboard" instability) in the resulting topologies; this provides the motivation for developing higher-order <b>shell</b> <b>elements</b> based on a classical shell theory. In this work, we present the formulation and implementation details for six-node and seven-node triangular, and nine-node quadrilateral <b>shell</b> <b>elements,</b> {{which are based on}} the variational formulation of Simo et al., and show that good accuracy is obtained even with coarse meshes in fairly demanding problems.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Shell</b> <b>elements</b> are {{the most}} {{efficient}} method for large scale simulations of sheet metal forming or deformation of sheet products. These elements have a limited description of the kinematics. This is normally a good approximation of the real deformation, but it cannot describe the failure behaviour of sheets, like necking and shear bands accurately. However, often such local details are not of interest and only the correct moment of failure {{and the amount of}} energy absorption is important. - Methods: Nonlocal damage models are able to produce mesh size independent results for damage softening materials. However the application of nonlocal damage models to <b>shell</b> <b>elements</b> is not straight forward. The size of <b>shells</b> <b>elements</b> is normally larger than the sheet thickness. Therefore {{it is not possible to}} use the same length scale in simulations with shells as used in simulations with solid elements. Furthermore even without damage the necking in simulations with <b>shell</b> <b>elements</b> is mesh size dependent. The neck has a width of one element, because the thickness of two neighbouring elements is not coupled. To overcome these problems in modelling failure in large scale simulations with <b>shell</b> <b>elements,</b> these <b>shells</b> <b>elements</b> will be combined with cohesive elements (Cirak, F 2005). The traction separation law (TSL) of the cohesive elements will be taken such that failure will take place in the cohesive element and the correct amount of energy is absorbed. The TSL is based on the combination of experiments and detailed studies using nonlocal damage models. The global response of the model with cohesive elements should be equal to the response of the detailed simulations. - Results: The proposed method is demonstrated on tensile and Nakazima tests (uni- and bi-axial loading) on thick ship plate steel. Simulations with solid <b>shells</b> and cohesive <b>elements</b> are compared with simulations with solid elements and a nonlocal damage model (Mediavilla, J 2006) and with experimental data. The used TSL is independent of the stress state, although it is known that ductile failure and necking depend on the stress state (triaxiality ratio). The results of the different simulations will be shown and discussed. - Conclusions: The simulations show that failure can be modelled with the combination of <b>shell</b> and cohesive <b>elements.</b> To improve the results quantitatively the TSL should be able to discriminate between different stress states...|$|R

40|$|The current {{investigation}} presents a global natural frequency and mode shape {{analysis of a}} semi-submersible platform. The purpose is to evaluate the separation in frequency between the semi-submersible’s global natural frequencies and the exciting wave spectrum. Two types of finite element models are compared: a beam element model and a <b>shell</b> <b>element</b> model. The main differences in the models are the level of resolution in details and model complexity. It is shown that both beam and <b>shell</b> <b>element</b> models {{can be used for}} the analysis. However, the beam element model is recommended for a first approximate assessment of the fundamental natural frequency and the interval/spectrum of global resonance frequencies compared to the wave spectrum. The <b>shell</b> <b>element</b> model is recommended when a more thorough analysis is required. In addition, the natural frequencies of the semi-submersible are calculated for free vibration in air. The fundamental frequency was 1. 9 Hz for the beam element model and 1. 5 Hz for the <b>shell</b> <b>element</b> model. When weights corresponding to a submerged structure in operation mode are considered, including the effects of added mass, the fundamental frequency for the first mode using the beam element model was decreased to 0. 7 Hz, and to 0. 6 Hz when using the <b>shell</b> <b>element</b> model.
