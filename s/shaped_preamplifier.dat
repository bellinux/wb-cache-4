40|$|The {{transition}} radiation detector {{of the heavy}} ion experiment ALICE at LHC (CERN) integrates parts of the data acquisition and trigger system. Therefore, a multi chip module has been developped which incorporates two microchips. Detector signals are preamplified and <b>shaped</b> (<b>Preamplifier</b> and Shaper Chip, PASA). Thereafter they are converted from analog to digital and are processed (Tracklet Processing Chip, TRAP). This thesis describes the digital signal processing of the TRAP chip. The input signals are filtered digitally. Then, they are analyzed by a preprocessor and four CPUs with respect to segments of tracks. The thesis covers the complete development from hardware design of filter and preprocessor, their calibration, programming of the CPUs, up to first application studies on a prototype system...|$|E
40|$|Single-crystal Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) diamond {{detectors}} {{feature a}} superb Signal-to-Noise ratio (S/N, timing response and good energy resolution. These properties make CVD diamonds interesting for neutron detection. In the present contribution we discuss different measurements of neutron energy with CVD diamonds applied to relatively low- and high-energy neutrons. For the low-energy range a compact neutron Time-of-Flight (ToF) spectrometer for high flux environments has been developed. Such a detector {{would allow the}} measurement of neutron spectra {{in the range from}} 250 keV up to few MeV with 20 – 40 % resolution in the neutron fluxes 105 < φn < 109 n/cm 2 /s. The first prototype of this spectrometer was tested at ENEA FNG 3 MeV quasi-monochromatic neutron beam and demonstrated feasibility of the concept. However, the test evidenced inadequacy of existing amplifiers providing insufficient timing resolution to extract a sensible neutron spectrum in MeV range. This particular diamond detector application, among with many others, calls for a development of a fast amplifier featuring an order of magnitude higher Signal-to-Noise ratio. On the other hand, to measure the neutron flux in a wide neutron energy range (1 – 100 MeV) at counting rate ∼ 2 MHz a single diamond crystal coupled to a fast (tens of ns) <b>shaping</b> <b>preamplifier</b> was used. The test performed at the n_TOF neutron beam line at CERN revealed the capability of using such a detector for spectroscopic measurement: the energy resolution achieved is about 4 % at the n-α peak at 9. 3 MeV, i. e. for 15 MeV neutrons. CVD diamond detectors have been proposed, successfully tested and applied as neutron flux monitors in nuclear reactor and around tokamaks. Furthermore, the possibility to extend the application of diamond films to neutron spectroscopy {{for a wide range of}} applications can be envisaged and already tested in fusion tokamak and around accelerators...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we present the circuit VERDI (VErsatile Readout for Detector Integration), an {{integrated}} circuit {{developed for the}} readout of different families of radiation detectors, from nitrogen-cooled Ge and Si(Li) detectors, to silicon drift detectors (SDDs), scintillation detectors, photomultipliers tubes and others. The circuit may represent a suitable solution when a compact integration between a multi-element detector and the front-end readout is needed to realize a compact and low-power detection module. The circuit includes 8 channels, each one composed by a charge <b>preamplifier,</b> a <b>shaping</b> amplifier, a gain stage, a baseline holder and a peak stretcher. An on-chip selector provides at the output of each channel the waveform of a specific stage, including an RC integrator for external digital processing of the signal. Alternatively, the 8 channels may be multiplexed on a single output. Different settings, like gain, <b>shaping</b> time, <b>preamplifier</b> compensation and others, may be externally programmed by SPI accordingly to the specific detector in use. Only the input JFET, feedback capacitor and reset device are left external to the ASIC, and must be chosen specifically for each detector. The results of preliminary experimental characterization of the circuit when used with different detectors are presented in this work...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a very-low power consumption circuit for processing the pulses from a semiconductor radiation detector. The circuit {{was designed for}} use with a cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) detector for unattended monitoring of stored nuclear materials. The device {{is intended to be}} battery powered and operate at low duty-cycles {{over a long period of}} time. This system will provide adequate performance for medium resolution gamma-ray pulse-height spectroscopy applications. The circuit incorporates the functions of a charge sensitive <b>preamplifier,</b> <b>shaping</b> amplifier, and peak sample and hold circuit. An application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) version of the design has been designed, built and tested. With the exception of the input field effect transistor (FET), the circuit is constructed using bipolar components. In this paper the design philosophy and measured performance characteristics of the circuit are described...|$|R
40|$|A custom analog VLSI chip {{is being}} {{developed}} for the readout of pixellated CdZnTe detectors in the focal plane of an astronomical hard X-ray telescope. The chip is intended for indium bump bonding to a pixel detector having pitch near 0. 5 mm. A complete precision analog signal processing chain, including charge sensitive <b>preamplifier,</b> <b>shaping</b> amplifiers and peak detect and hold circuit, is provided for each pixel. Here we describe the circuitry and discuss {{the performance of a}} functional prototype fabricated in a 1. 2 um CMOS process at Orbit Semiconductor. Dynamic performance is found to be close to SPICE model predictions over a self-triggering range extending from 1 to 150 keV (200 to 30000 electrons). Integral non-linearity (1 %) and noise (0. 25 keV or 50 electrons FWHM with 200 fF input capacitance) while acceptable are not as good as predicted. Power consumption is only 250 uW per pixel. Layout and design techniques are discussed which permit successful self-triggering operation at the low 1 keV threshold...|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} testing of ultraheavy-nucleus pulse {{detectors}} based on pyroelectric materials are reported, extending the preliminary findings of Tuzzolino (1983) and Simpson and Tuzzolino (1983). Uranium-ion beams of about 240 MeV/u are detected by a 39. 5 -micron-thick Si detector, degraded to about 175 MeV/u by Al absorbers, and then strike 700 -micron-thick polyvinylidene fluoride or 1000 -micron-thick LiTaO 3 pyroelectric samples. Both detector systems are connected to a coincidence circuit via charge-sensitive <b>preamplifiers,</b> <b>shaping</b> amplifiers with 30 -microsec effective time constants, and electronic discriminators. Sample spectra are shown, and the pulse heights measured are found to agree with theoretical calculations to within a factor of about 2. The response of the pyroelectric materials {{is found to be}} unaffected by exposure to about 10 Mrad of 2 - 7 -MeV/u heavy ion radiation. With further study and improvement of the detection sensitivity, devices of this type could be applied to large-area space measurements of low ultraheavy-ion fluxes...|$|R
40|$|Pulse <b>shapes</b> of <b>preamplifier</b> signals for VEGA and EU-ROBALL {{detectors}} [1] under high {{magnetic field}} were further investigated. The analysis provides a new method which drives {{to recover the}} energy resolution under strong magnetic fields. The observation of a simultaneous large shift and broadening of the rise time distributions [2, 3] of preamplifier signals suggests that an incomplete signal integration by shaping amplifiers could be the main origin of the observed energy shift. To verify the latter conjecture, the response to output signals of the shaping amplifier on different risetime of input signals has been investigated with a pulse generator, {{and it has been}} confirmed that the rise-time variations are the main source of the observed energy shift and reflects the effect of the magnetic field on the charge collection process itself. Fig. 1 shows distributions of pulse heights of the output signals of the shaping amplifier measured by an CAMAC ADC as a function of measured risetime of preamplifier signals by a flash-ADC for one of the segments of the VEGA detector at different magnetic fields, showing a strong correlation between the observables. The fit of a parabolic function to the correlation (see solid lines in Fig. 1) enables a correction of the energy spectra event-by-event for different magnetic fields. The correction functions are similar for all measurements at non-zero magnetic field, but they are shifted relative to that of the measurement at B = 0 T. Presently the origin of this strong shift is not understood. Fig. 2 shows the corrected γ-ray energy spectra (dashed line) for the same segment of the VEGA detector at 1. 6 T in comparison to the one without correction shown by a dashed line. A significant improvement in the peak shape has been achieved. After applying the correction, an improvement on the energy resolution for the both VEGA and EUROBALL Cluster has been achieved, and the remaining degradation at fields larger than 1 T amounts to approximately 0. 5 keV...|$|R
40|$|The idea of {{building}} a Serial Interface Controller (SIC) proposed by Paul O`Connor, Instrumentation Division, BNL {{is to determine the}} feasibility of incorporating a Serial Interface Controlled CMOS IC`s for charge amplification, shaping, analog storage and multiplexing used in particle detectors for high energy physics experiments. The serial data pumped into the CMOS ICs will be used to control many circuit parameters like digitally controlled gain, <b>shaping</b> time, precision <b>preamplifier</b> calibration circuits and many other parameters like timing discriminators mode of operation. The SIC board built will be tested on a Serial Interface Controlled Digital - to - Analog Convertor, which follows either Motorola`s SPI/QSPI or National Semiconductors Microwire interface technique. The DAC chosen for this was MAXIM`s MAX 537, a Quad, 12 -bit DAC. The function of this controller can be achieved by using some on-shelf micro-controllers like the Motorola`s MC 68 HC 11, which offers dedicated SPI ports. The drawback encountered in using this controller is the overhead involved in putting together an user interface where the user can dynamically change its settings and load the SIC device. This is very critical in testing fewer number of CMOS IC`s having SIC. The SIC board described here takes care of this dynamic user interface issue...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{we present}} {{the design and}} the results of a CMOS analog channel for silicon microstrips detectors. The readout circuit was {{initially}} conceived for the outer layers of the SuperB silicon vertex tracker (SVT), but can serve more generally other microstrip-based detection systems. The strip detectors considered show a very high stray capacitance and high series resistance. Therefore, the noise optimization was the first priority design concern. A necessary compromise on the best peaking time to achieve an acceptable noise level together with efficiency and timing accuracy has been investigated. The ASIC is composed by a <b>preamplifier,</b> <b>shaping</b> amplifier and a Time over Threshold (T. o. T) block for the digitalization of the signals. The chosen shaping function is the third-order semi-Gaussian function implemented with complex poles. An inverter stage is employed in the analog channel in order to operate with signals delivered from both p and n strips. The circuit includes the possibility to select the peaking time of the shaper output from four values: 250 ns, 375 ns, 500 ns and 750 ns. In this way, the noise performances and the signal occupancy can be optimized according to the real background during the experiment. The ASIC prototype has been fabricated in the 130 nm IBM technology which is considered intrinsically radiation hard. The results of the experimental characterization of a produced prototype are satisfactorily matched with simulation...|$|R
40|$|For several years, {{the authors}} have studied the {{electrical}} output of GaAs detectors in response to MeV protons. Beams from the Los Alamos National Laboratory`s tandem Van de Graaff, bunched into pulses of about 0. 7 -ns width, {{have been used to}} drive detectors into the current mode, and fast electronics have enabled characterization of the impulse response shapes and the absolute sensitivities. Recently, the authors extended this line of investigation to measure output-charge spectra in response to low-current beams, in which the count rate was low and pulses due to individual ionizing particles were analyzed. The first part of the work was the measurement of spectra of the output charge of the detectors when bombarded by a beam of MeV-energy protons, which was collimated to a diameter of 0. 1 mm. The GaAs detector was mounted on a microadjustable stage just behind the collimator, so that the site of irradiation on the detector could be varied. Output pulses originating from the impacts of individual protons were preamplified with charge-sensitive Lecroy 2004 <b>preamplifiers,</b> <b>shaped</b> with Lecroy 2011 amplifiers, and analyzed with a Lecroy 3500 multichannel analyzer. The second part was the measurement of the time response of the detector to a 0. 1 mm-collimated bunched proton beam. The proton bunch width was less than 1 ns, during which time many protons struck the detector, driving it into the current mode where individual proton impacts are unresolved. A possible detector design is suggested by the results. In the past, GaAs time response has been improved by doping or radiation damaging, which introduces traps. The tails can be eliminated, but at the cost of a factor of a thousand in main peak sensitivity. It now appears that by masking off the region of the detector near the negative electrode, the tails can be eliminated with only a factor of about ten loss in peak gain...|$|R
