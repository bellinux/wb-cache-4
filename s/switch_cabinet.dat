40|$|Abstract. In long-period {{running of}} <b>switch</b> <b>cabinet,</b> the {{temperature}} of contact points will be rose by the big contact resistance, poor contact and longtime overloading. Overheat can cause oxidation of contact points and the increasing of contact resistance, and then the contact may be generated the spark and arc discharge. That is a bad circle. So {{the temperature of}} contact points can affect the reliability of <b>switch</b> <b>cabinet.</b> For detecting the temperature of contacts and the switch cabinet’s environment in Yanjin transformer substation, we design an Insulated FBG temperature sensor. The surveys of upper reaches indicate that the temperature of moving contact A gets the maximum 32. 98 ℃ Aug. 20, 2011, the temperature of stationary contact A gets the minimum 5. 75 ℃, and the change temperature between contacts and environment gets the maximum 2. 82 ℃.

40|$|Due to {{the growing}} ranges of {{applications}} for stamped parts in the electrical and electronics industry (e. g. <b>switch</b> <b>cabinet</b> cladding and transformer plates) {{as well as in}} the automotive industry (e. g. stamp, bent and drawn components), flexible sheet metal forming has become a more important process. The inner and outer contours as well as the forming operations needed to reinforce metal sheets can be carried out by punching machines without re-clamping the metal sheet. In contrast, the potential of conventional punching machines is now exhausted in terms of the material spectrum that can be processed, the tool life and the quality of the machined product. Particularly in view of the machining quality of the sheared edges, the achievable clear-cut surface rates are limited due to the limited plasticity of the sheet materials. When cracks form between the grain boundaries of the sheet material during the conventional shearing process, the cutting edge is divided into a c lear-cut surface zone (approx. 30 % of the plate thickness when shearing stainless steel plates: 1. 4301) and a shearing zone with crack formation. This shearing zone can not be used as a functional surface. The shearing process is divided into the four phases (DIN 8588) "warping", "clear-cutting", "fracture" and "ejection of the piece punched out"...|$|E

Diplomska naloga obravnava nadzor in optimizacijo porabe električne energije varilne naprave, robota in mize – treh največjih porabnikov robotske varilne celice. V prvem delu so predstavljeni njeni porabniki: glavna stikalna omara, robotski krmilnik, robotski {{manipulator}}, miza ali pozicioner, vpenjalno-pozicionirno orodje, varilni sistem, čistilnik, dvoročni samostoječi pult in komandna plošča. Robotski krmilnik vodi mnogokratne naloge z možnostjo vodenja do osem robotov. V glavni stikalni omari se nahajajo vsi napajalni gradniki celice. Gibljivi strojni del celice sta robotski manipulator in miza z vpenjalno-pozicionirnim orodjem. Varilni sistem sestavljajo varilni izvor, povezni paket in varilna pištola. Čistilnik skrbi za čiščenje šobe varilne pištole. Dvoročni samostoječi pult in komandna plošča, na kateri so vsa glavna stikala, se uporabljata za upravljanje celice. Z meritvami parametrov robota, mize in varilne naprave smo izdelali dve preglednici nadzora porabe električne energije in dve predlogi HMI (human-machine interface). V njih se podatki sami preračunajo do porabe električne energije v kilovatnih urah in stroškov porabe v evrih za en, sto tisoč ter tri milijone zvarjenih kosov. V primerjavi varilna naprava porabi med tri do štirikrat več električne energije kot robot in miza skupaj, razmerje je odvisno predvsem od izbranega varilnega postopka. Porabo električne energije je možno najbolj optimizirati pri varilni napravi z dobro izbiro in nastavitvijo varilnega postopka z nanašanjem varilnega materiala s pulziranjem toka. Pri robotu in mizi je največji prihranek energije možen z izklopom servo regulacije motorjev robota, medtem ko robotska varilna celica v času odmorov za malico ne obratuje. Hardware producers {{strive to}} offer their customers a technologically perfected robotic cell. Two important factors that customers take into consideration are the overview of energy consumption and a possibility for optimization {{with regard to the}} energy cost savings. This thesis deals with the electricity consumption of a welding machine, robot and positioner, three main energy consumers of a robotic welding cell. The first part of the thesis describes the consumers of a robotic welding cell: robot controller, main <b>switch</b> <b>cabinet,</b> robot manipulator, positioner, clamping-positioning tool, welding system, cleaner, two-handed stand-alone counter and command panel. The robot controller performs multiple tasks and has the possibility to supervise up to eight robots. The power components are located in the main switching cabinet. The moving parts of the robotic welding cell are the robot manipulator and the positioner with the clamping-positioning tool. The welding system is composed of a welding source, a connecting package and a welding pistol. The cleaner carries out cleaning of the welding pistol 2 ̆ 7 s nozzle. The two-handed stand-alone counter and the command panel with all the main switches are used to operate the robotic welding cell. By measuring the parameters of the robot, the positioner and the welding source we compiled two tables showing electricity consumption and designed two HMI (human-machine interface). The tables automatically calculate the electricity consumption for one, 100, 000 and 3 million welded products in kilowatt hours and the costs in EUR. In comparison to the robot with the positioner, the welding source consumes three to four times more power, whereby the ratio mainly depends on the selected welding process. The electricity consumption of the welding tool can be best optimized by good setting and choosing the right welding process. With regard to the robot and the positioner, the most electricity can be saved by deactivating the servo regulation of the robot motors during the lunch time, when the robotic welding cell is not in operation...|$|E

The network topology, which connects <b>switches</b> in <b>cabinets</b> on a machine room floor, is {{typically}} defined once and for all at system deployment time. For a diverse application workload, there are downsides to having a single wired topology. In this work, we propose using free-space optics (FSO) in large-scale systems so that a diverse application workload can be better supported. A high-density layout of FSO terminals on top of the cabinets is determined that allows line-of-sight communication between arbitrary cabinet pairs. We first show that our proposal reduces both end-to-end network latency and total cable length when compared to a wired topology. We then demonstrate that the use of FSO links improves the embedding/partitioning capabilities of a wired topology. More specifically, we show that a recently proposed random low-latency topology can be augmented with a reasonable number of FSO links to support multiple k-ary n-cube and fat tree embedded topologies. Finally, we investigate power-aware on/off link regulation techniques and show how adding/reconfiguring FSO links leads to both performance and power efficiency improvements. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—As {{the scales}} of {{supercomputers}} increase total cable length becomes enormous, e. g., up to thousands of kilometers. Recent high-radix switches with dozens of ports make switch layout and system packaging more complex. In this study, we study the optimization of the physical layout of topologies of switches on a machine room floor {{with the goal of}} reducing cable length. For a given topology, using graph clustering algorithms, we group <b>switches</b> logically into <b>cabinets</b> so that the number of inter-cabinet cables is small. Then, we map the cabinets onto a physical floor space so as to minimize total cable length. This is done by modeling and optimizing the mapping problem as a facility location problem. Our evaluation results show that, when compared to standard clustering/mapping approaches and for popular network topologies, our clustering approach can reduce the number of inter-cabinet cables by up to 40. 3 % and our mapping approach can reduce the inter-rack cable length by up to 39. 6 %.

40|$|This {{report is}} the result of a master thesis at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Division of Industrial and Economical Development, at Linköping University of Technology. The project was carried out on behalf of Fanerami AB, Mjölby and {{includes}} 20 weeks of full time schedule work. Cabinets with vertical mounted roller shutters all share the same problem, namely weight balancing. A roller shutter has an equilibrium area where the sum of the different forces acting on the shutter equals zero. As the shutter leaves that area it will pick up speed as it falls towards the bottom. When the shutter hits the bottom of the cabinet there is a potential risk of getting fingers caught and in this project a solution to prevent this from happening was to be presented. In this project, three concepts have been generated with the following different purposes: •In concept 1 the risk of getting any fingers caught when the shutter closes was to be eliminated in an efficient and inexpensive way. •In concept 2 the roller shutter had to be balanced at all time providing the possibility to keep the cabinet open in any position. •The last and most challenging task was to create a remote controlled TV cabinet. The shutters were mounted horizontally and were to be opened simply by pushing the bottom either on the remote transmitter unit or the cabinet. The first concept uses a small oil damper, often seen in kitchen cabinets and drawers. The roller shutter applies pressure on the damper via a lever that transforms the shutter motion along a certain path to a smaller motion in the direction of the damper. By doing so, a smaller damper with higher pressure can be used. Dampers are available with several different pressures and can be mounted in five different positions; therefore the concept can be adjusted to fit almost any cabinet. Concept 2 consists of a thin cord winded around a wheel. The wheel is equipped with a spring that tightens when the cord is pulled in. The spring produces an equal and opposite force that holds the shutter in balance. As the wheel is mounted in the upper front of the cabinet, underneath the shutter, it will almost be invisible. The concept is easy to adjust to most cabinets by simply attach the shutter at different levels. In that way the spring will be tightened to equal the weight of the shutter. The design of the TV cabinet has been a working progress throughout the whole project. A couple of prototypes were produced before the final concept. The mechanical solution is based on two pinion rackets placed one on each side of a rotating pinion powered by a motor through a planetary gearbox. To control the cabinet Electronic Solutions AB developed an electronic system that made it possible to open and close the shutters with a remote control or a <b>switch</b> on the <b>cabinet...</b>|$|R
