40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the study of an {{extension}} of dynamic programming approach which allows optimization of partial decision rules relative to the length or coverage. We introduce an uncertainty measure J(T) which is the difference between number of rows in a decision table T and number of rows with the most common decision for T. For a nonnegative real number γ, we consider γ-decision rules (partial decision rules) that localize rows in <b>subtables</b> <b>of</b> T with uncertainty at most γ. Presented algorithm constructs a directed acyclic graph Δ γ(T) which nodes are <b>subtables</b> <b>of</b> the decision table T given by systems of equations of the kind "attribute = value". This algorithm finishes the partitioning <b>of</b> a <b>subtable</b> when its uncertainty is at most γ. The graph Δ γ(T) allows us to describe the whole set of so-called irredundant γ-decision rules. We can optimize such set of rules according to length or coverage. This paper contains also results of experiments with decision tables from UCI Machine Learning Repository...|$|R

40|$|This {{chapter is}} devoted to the study of an {{extension}} of dynamic programming approach which allows optimization of approximate decision rules relative to the length and coverage. We introduce an uncertainty measure that is the difference between number of rows in a given decision table and the number of rows labeled with the most common decision for this table divided by the number of rows in the decision table. We fix a threshold γ, such that 0 ≤ γ < 1, and study so-called γ-decision rules (approximate decision rules) that localize rows in subtables which uncertainty is at most γ. Presented algorithm constructs a directed acyclic graph Δ γ T which nodes are <b>subtables</b> <b>of</b> the decision table T given by pairs "attribute = value".

40|$|This {{chapter is}} devoted to the design of new tools for the study of {{decision}} trees. These tools are based on dynamic programming approach and need the consideration <b>of</b> <b>subtables</b> <b>of</b> the initial decision table. So this approach is applicable only to relatively small decision tables. The considered tools allow us to compute: 1. Theminimum cost of an approximate decision tree for a given uncertainty value and a cost function. 2. The minimum number of nodes in an exact decision tree whose depth is at most a given value. For the first tool we considered various cost functions such as: depth and average depth of a decision tree and number of nodes (and number of terminal and nonterminal nodes) of a decision tree. The uncertainty of a decision table is equal to the number of unordered pairs of rows with different decisions. The uncertainty of approximate decision tree is equal to the maximum uncertainty <b>of</b> a <b>subtable</b> corresponding to a terminal node of the tree. In addition to the algorithms for such tools we also present experimental results applied to various datasets acquired from UCI ML Repository [4]. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013...|$|R

Vol.) : 16 - 43. ] {{argues that}} norms of {{judgement}} pose no special problem for naturalism, because all such norms of judgement {{are derived from}} moral or personal values. Papineau claims that this account of the normativity of judgement presupposes an account <b>of</b> <b>content</b> that places normativity outside the analysis <b>of</b> <b>content,</b> because in his view any accounts <b>of</b> <b>content</b> that place normativity inside the analysis <b>of</b> <b>content</b> cannot explain the normativity of judgement in the derivative way he proposes. Furthermore, he argues that normative accounts <b>of</b> <b>content</b> along those lines are independently problematic. In this paper I aim to respond to both objections, by arguing that normative accounts <b>of</b> <b>content</b> {{can be seen as}} naturalist accounts, even if they place normativity inside the analysis of content; and that normative accounts <b>of</b> <b>content</b> are compatible with a derivative account of norms of judgement of the sort Papineau advocates...|$|R
