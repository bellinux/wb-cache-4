50|$|The Spanish Constitution of 1978 {{states in}} Article 2 that the Spanish {{language}} {{is the official}} language, but allows autonomous communities to provide a co-official language status for the other languages of Spain. Consequently, the Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Autonomous Community establishes Basque as the co-official language of the autonomous community. The <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Navarre</b> establishes Spanish as the official language of Navarre, but grants co-official status to the Basque language in the Basque-speaking areas of northern Navarre. Basque has no official status in the French Basque Country and French citizens are barred from officially using Basque in a French court of law. However, the use of Basque by Spanish nationals in French courts is permitted (with translation), as Basque is officially recognized {{on the other side}} of the border.|$|E
50|$|The debate {{arising from}} this {{new set of}} {{standard}} language rules (1968-1976) did not prevent Standard Basque from becoming increasingly accepted as the Basque standard language in teaching, the media, and administration (1976-1983), {{within the context of}} burgeoning regional government (<b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> Autonomy of the Basque Country, 1979; Improvement of the Charter <b>of</b> <b>Navarre,</b> 1982).|$|R
50|$|Navarre has a {{separate}} <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> autonomy, a contentious arrangement designed during Spanish {{transition to democracy}} (the Amejoramiento, an 'upgrade' of its previous status during dictatorship). It refers back to the kingdom status <b>of</b> <b>Navarre</b> (up to 1841) and their traditional institutional and legal framework (charters). Basque, the original and main language <b>of</b> <b>Navarre</b> up to the late 18th century, has kept family transmission especially {{in the northern part}} <b>of</b> <b>Navarre</b> and central areas to a lesser extent, designated as Basque speaking or mixed area in Navarrese law. Questions of political, linguistic and cultural allegiance and identity are highly complex in Navarre. Politically some Basque nationalists would like to integrate with the Basque Autonomous Community.|$|R
50|$|On 5 November 1933, {{two weeks}} before a general election, a {{referendum}} was held in Álava, Gipuzkoa, and Biscay on new wording for the <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> Devolution, which abandoned the inclusion <b>of</b> <b>Navarre.</b> The wording was approved by an overwhelming majority (459,000 votes in favour, 14,000 against), although in Álava, the votes in favour did not reach 50%.|$|R
50|$|The Basque Country or Basque Autonomous Community {{was granted}} {{the status of}} {{nationality}} within Spain, attributed by the Spanish Constitution of 1978. The autonomous community {{is based on the}} <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> Autonomy of the Basque Country, a foundational legal document providing the framework {{for the development of the}} Basque people on Spanish soil, although the territory <b>of</b> <b>Navarre</b> was left out and made into a separate autonomous community.|$|R
50|$|He was {{a leading}} figure in the Basque Nationalist Party (EAJ-PNV) <b>of</b> <b>Navarre</b> in the period 1975-80. In 1979, he has elected {{president}} of the Basque General Council, the preautonomic body preparing the devolution of powers to the Basque Country prior to the approval <b>of</b> the <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> Autonomy. Once approved, Garaikoetxea was elected Lehendakari in 1980 and reelected in 1984.|$|R
50|$|The debate {{arising from}} this {{new set of}} {{standard}} language rules (1968-1976) did not prevent it from becoming increasingly accepted in teaching, the media, and administration (1976-1983), {{within the context of}} burgeoning regional government (<b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> Autonomy in Euskadi, 1979; Improvement of the Charter <b>of</b> <b>Navarre,</b> 1982). Many people, however, continue to oppose the imposition of a single created dialect of Basque.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> Autonomy of the Basque Country {{retained}} {{though in}} its wording {{the spirit of}} the original blueprint, namely allowing the necessary means for the development in liberty of the Basque people, while now limited only to the western Álava, Gipuzkoa and Biscay provinces.

5000|$|Navarre, on {{the other}} hand, chose not to form part of the {{autonomous}} community of the Basque Country and, unlike the other communities, it acceded to self-government by taking {{as a starting point}} the recognition of their fueros, based on the Ley Paccionada, [...] "Negotiated Law", of 1841, which had been declared valid. In lieu <b>of</b> a <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> Autonomy per se, the Parliament <b>of</b> <b>Navarre</b> passed a Law of Reintegration and Improvement <b>of</b> <b>Navarre's</b> Chartered Regime, even if in practice this Law is recognized as the equivalent <b>of</b> a <b>Statute</b> <b>of</b> Autonomy. This Law for Navarre also created its own treasury and established its fiscal autonomy, and, {{as in the case of}} the Basque Country, Navarre collects all taxes and then sends a [...] "quota" [...] or [...] "contribution" [...] to the central government. The main difference between the Basque Country and Navarre, is that in the Basque Country it is the historical territories (Araba, Gipuzkoa and Biscay) that have their own [...] "chartered" [...] system, and as such they are recognized as [...] "chartered deputations" [...] (diputaciones forales, fora aldundi) which then jointly conform the autonomous community of the Basque Country, whereas Navarre, being a province and an autonomous community in itself, is recognized as a [...] "chartered community" [...] (comunidad foral, foru erkidego) as opposed to an [...] "autonomous community".|$|R
