5000|$|Initially, EFSF and ESM {{were only}} allowed to offer {{financial}} stability loans directly to sovereign states, meaning that offered bank recapitalisation packages were first {{paid to the}} state and then transferred to the suffering financial sector; and thus these type of loans were accounted for as national debt of the sovereign state - adversely impacting its gross debt-to-GDP ratio and credit rating. In example, this regime was utilized when ESM established a bank recapitalization support programme for Spain in 2012-13. On the EU summit on 19 October 2012, it was decided that ESM bank recapitalisation packages in the future (starting from the date when ECBs new supervision unit for the financial sector has been set to commence operations: 4 November 2014), instead only shall by paid directly to the financial sector, so that it no longer counts as state debt in the statistics. ESM made the decided [...] "direct bank recapitalization" [...] framework operational starting from December 2014, as a new novel ultimate backstop instrument to apply for systemic banks in their recovery/resolution phase, if such banks will be found in need to receive additional recapitalization funds after conducted bail-in by private creditors and regulated payment by the Single Resolution Fund. In this way, the primary backstop to patch future uncovered recapitalization needs of a failing <b>systemic</b> <b>bank</b> will be provided by bail-in of private creditors along with contributions from the Single Resolution Fund (as regulated by the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive), while the ESM [...] "direct bank recapitalization" [...] instrument only will be needed as an [...] "ultimate backstop" [...] for the most extreme cases where the primary backstop funds are found to be insufficient.|$|E

40|$|The present work {{proposes a}} new {{methodology}} {{to estimate the}} reduction in the probability of occurrence of a <b>systemic</b> <b>banking</b> crisis entailed by the implementation of the Basel III framework for banking regulation. This is achieved by making use of the SYMBOL model (<b>SYstemic</b> Model of <b>Banking</b> Originated Losses) jointly developed by the JRC, DG MARKT, and experts of banking regulation (see De Lisa et al., 2010) that estimates, given Basel capital requirements, the losses and liquidity shortfalls deriving from banks' defaults. A <b>systemic</b> <b>banking</b> crisis is defined in this work as a situation where liquidity shortfalls are higher than a certain threshold, beyond which public authorities would find it difficult to intervene by injecting liquidity and therefore would have hard time in trying and avoiding that the crisis spreads further. In particular, we assume that the threshold for a <b>systemic</b> <b>banking</b> crisis in any country corresponds to 3 % of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Given this definition, the probability of a <b>systemic</b> <b>banking</b> crisis is derived from the distribution of liquidity shortfalls affecting the banking system due to banks¿ default. The reduction in the probability of a <b>systemic</b> <b>banking</b> crisis deriving from the adoption of Basel III is obtained by running the SYMBOL model under alternative scenarios for banks¿ capital, in particular considering the estimated change in banks¿ capital requirements induced by Basel III. The macro-economic impact of implementing Basel III is also estimated coupling the results of the SYMBOL model with a cost-benefit framework proposed by the Bank of England (2010), which estimates the net gains of tightening capital requirements as a percentage of a country¿s GDP. Benefits arise from the expected fall in GDP (that follows a <b>banking</b> <b>systemic</b> crisis) avoided thanks to a reduction in the probability of having a <b>systemic</b> <b>banking</b> crisis; costs derive instead from the increase in lending rates introduced by banks as a reaction to the tighter Basel III capital requirements that in turn induce a decrease in non-financial firms¿ investments and a drop in GDP. The proposed approach is applied to representative samples of banks from a few European countries: France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Our main results are as follows: first, regarding the effect of Basel III on the probability of a <b>systemic</b> <b>banking</b> crisis, we find that its reduction considerably depends on the initial level of banks' capital and on the level of recapitalization of banks that follows the implementation of Basel III; second, regarding the macro-economic impact of Basel III, we find that the net benefits of implementing Basel III are always positive and almost always larger in the scenario where the capital conservation buffer is introduced.
