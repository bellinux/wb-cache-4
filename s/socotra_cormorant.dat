50|$|There are 215 common {{birds in}} Qatar. The desert and the {{shoreline}} form an important resting {{site for a}} number of migratory bird species during autumn and spring. Coastal birds include gulls, terns, turnstones, sanderlings, kentish plovers, herons and <b>Socotra</b> <b>cormorants.</b> They are usually observed year-round. Lark species, including hoopoes, crested larks and ashy-crowned sparrow-larks are commonly observed in the desert during the summer. More commonly occurring species during the autumn and spring are swallows, swifts, house martins, warblers, redstarts, shrikes, wheatears, wagtails, harriers and falcons (including kestrels). Four of the primary types of birds which can be observed in deserts during the winter are various types of waders and gulls, coots, and little grebes. Rare birds such as the avocet and red-billed tropicbird breed on the peninsula.|$|R
50|$|Since 2000, {{this species}} has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, {{on the grounds}} of its small number of {{breeding}} localities and ongoing rapid decline. The decline is caused by coastal development, disturbance and marine pollution near its nesting colonies; in 2000 it was estimated that the world population was about 110,000 breeding pairs or 330,000-500,000 individual birds. The only protected nesting colony in the Persian Gulf is one of about 30,000 pairs on the Bahraini Hawar Islands off the coast of Qatar, and this is a Ramsar Convention listed site. Of the remaining 13 colonies (9 different locations), the Hawar colony is the largest. In the northern part of its range alone, about 12 colonies are known to have disappeared since the 1960s. The birds may also be affected by oil pollution at sea. During the First Gulf War, images of badly oiled cormorants from the Gulf were regularly shown in the western media, and although the great cormorant is also found in the Gulf, it is likely that many of these were <b>Socotra</b> <b>cormorants.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Socotra</b> <b>Cormorants</b> (Phalacrocorax nigrogularis) are {{regionally}} endemic seabirds with restricted distribution. To {{better understand}} their nest selection, we assessed vegetation and soil elements in their nesting areas at Siniya Island of United Arab Emirates. Field sampling was done from three areas (2011 nesting area, 2012 nesting area and control area) in February and March in 2013. Sampling consisted of vegetation assessment {{in the field}} and close-range photography. Ground cover within quadrats was classified into the percent of (1) living cover, (2) dead cover, (3) droppings, (4) bare ground and (5) other. Soil samples were analyzed for thirteen elements. Multivariate stepwise discriminant analysis was performed to determine the importance of the attributes on nest sites. The contribution of Function 1 to the discriminant model was estimated to be 77. 4 %, whereas Function 2 contributed 22. 6 % to the discriminant model (P ≤ 0 : 05). Sites could not be classified adequately using ground cover alone; however, discriminant analysis using soil attributes could better distinguish sites. We noted that Fe and Mn had high discriminant ability in Function 1, whereas Al and Cr showed high discriminant roles for Function 2. The contribution of Function 1 to the model, using soil attributes, was estimated to be 90. 7 % (P ≤ 0 : 05). The combination of ground cover and soil attributes did not improve discrimination of nest sites. Furthermore, some soil variables (Ca, Na, Cd and Cr) were much higher than normal levels in soil, indicating high transport of marine nutrients to nesting sites, which could detrimentally affect surrounding vegetation...|$|R

50|$|The <b>Socotra</b> <b>cormorant</b> (Phalacrocorax nigrogularis) is a {{threatened}} species of cormorant that is endemic to the Persian Gulf and the south-east {{coast of the}} Arabian Peninsula. It is also sometimes known as the Socotran cormorant or, more rarely, as the Socotra shag. Individuals occasionally migrate as far west as the Red Sea coast. Despite its name, it was only confirmed in 2005 that it breeds on the Socotra islands in the Indian Ocean.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Socotra</b> <b>cormorant</b> is {{an almost}} entirely blackish bird with a total length of about 80 cm. In {{breeding}} condition, its forecrown has a purplish gloss and its upperparts have a slaty-green tinge, {{there are a few}} white plumes around the eye and neck and a few white streaks at the rump. Its legs and feet are black and its gular skin blackish. All these deviations from pure black are less marked outside the breeding season.|$|E
50|$|The western {{shore of}} the gulf is a {{protected}} area known as the Gulf of Salwah Protected Area, and is designated as an Important Bird and Biodiversity Area. It is the main breeding ground of the <b>Socotra</b> <b>cormorant</b> in Saudi Arabia. Other birds that breed here include the Caspian tern, white-cheeked tern, lesser crested tern and bridled tern. Migratory birds that overwinter here include the western reef heron, black-necked grebe, great crested grebe, Pallas's gull, slender-billed gull and Caspian gull.|$|E
50|$|Al-Sinniyah island, {{close to}} the town of Umm al-Quwain is home to the UAE's largest <b>Socotra</b> <b>cormorant</b> colony, with over 15,000 pairs making it the third largest colony in the world.

Blacktip reef sharks patrol the outer shoreline, while green turtles are ubiquitous in the inner leads in particular. Between Al-Sinniyah and the mainland is Khor al-Beidah, an expansive area of sand and mud flats of international importance for its waterfowl.|$|E
50|$|By contrast, the Hawar Islands {{have fewer}} habitat types {{and only about}} 60 migratory species have been {{recorded}} here. Many of these are seabirds and after the spring migrants have departed northwards, the breeding birds start to arrive. The Hawar Islands have been designated as an Important Bird and Biodiversity Area by BirdLife International. The main trigger species are the western reef heron, <b>Socotra</b> <b>cormorant,</b> white-cheeked tern, Saunders's tern and the Sooty falcon. It {{is also an important}} wintering area for the great crested grebe and the greater flamingo.|$|E
50|$|Bu Tinah is {{actually}} a cluster of islands and shoals, joined or almost so at low water, with nowhere greater {{than two or three}} metres above sea level. The main island has a sheltered lagoon opening to the south with the low energy environment permitting stands of mature mangrove to flourish. Even birds like the <b>Socotra</b> <b>cormorant</b> are found here. There are also healthy coral reef habitats with as many as 16 species of coral recorded in the area. The reefs survive in conditions that would kill coral species {{in other parts of the}} world.The waters of the Persian Gulf are among the most saline in the world, as well as among the warmest. Corals live in water that is between 23°C and 28°C but in the UAE water temperatures go as high as 35°C in summer.|$|E
40|$|International audienceGroup {{foraging}} contradicts classic ecological theory because {{intraspecific competition}} normally increases with aggregation. Hence, {{there should be}} evolutionary benefits to group foraging. The study of group foraging in the field remains challenging however, {{because of the large}} number of individuals involved and the remoteness of the interactions to the observer. Biologging represents a cost-effective solution to these meth-odological issues. By deploying GPS and temperature–depth loggers on individuals {{over a period of several}} consecutive days, we investigated intraspecific foraging interactions in the <b>Socotra</b> <b>cormorant</b> Phalacrocorax nigrogularis, a threatened colonial sea-bird endemic to the Arabian Peninsula. In particular, we examined how closely birds from the same colony associated with each other spatially when they were at sea at the same time and the distance between foraging dives at different periods of the day. Results show that the position of different birds overlapped substantially, all birds targeting the same general foraging grounds throughout the day, likely following the same school of fish. There were as many as 44, 500 birds within the foraging flock at sea at any time (50 % of the colony), and flocking density was high, with distance between birds ranging from 8 to 1, 380 m. Birds adopted a diving strategy maximizing time spent underwater relative to surface time, resulting in up to 72 % of birds underwater in potential contact with prey at all times while foraging. Our data suggest that the benefits of group foraging outweigh the costs of intense aggregation in this sea-bird. Prey detection and information transmission are facilitated in large groups. Once discovered, shoaling prey are concentrated under the effect of the multitude. Fish school cohesiveness is then disorganized by continuous attacks of diving birds to facilitate prey capture. Decreasing population size could pose a risk to the persistence of threatened seabirds where group size is important for foraging success...|$|E
