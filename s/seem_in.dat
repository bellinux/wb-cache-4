5|$|In April 1827, the American naturalist {{and bird}} painter John James Audubon came to Britain {{to find a}} {{suitable}} printer for his enormous Birds of America. Bewick, still lively at age 74, showed him the woodcut he was working on, a dog afraid of tree stumps that <b>seem</b> <b>in</b> the dark to be devilish figures, and gave Audubon {{a copy of his}} Quadrupeds for his children.|$|E
5|$|Her {{career is}} marked by an unusually, even spectacularly, high degree of {{interpenetration}} between her publicly available private life and her films. The star phenomenon depends upon collapsing {{the distinction between the}} star-as-person and the star-as-performer. This does not usually mean that the incidents of a film's scenario are taken to be actual incidents in the star's life but rather that they 'reveal' or express the personality of the type-of-person of the star. In the case of Turner, however, not only do her vehicles furnish characters and situations in accord with her off-screen image, but frequently incidents in them echo incidents in her life so {{that by the end of}} her career films like Peyton Place, Imitation of Life, Madame X and Love Has Many Faces <b>seem</b> <b>in</b> parts like mere illustrations of her life.|$|E
25|$|Capacity is {{inversely}} proportional to headway. Therefore, moving from two-second headways to one-second headways would double PRT capacity. Half-second headways would quadruple capacity. Theoretical minimum PRT headways {{would be based on}} the mechanical time to engage brakes, and these are much less than a half second. Although no regulatory agency has as yet (June 2006) approved headways shorter than two seconds, researchers suggest that high capacity PRT (HCPRT) designs could operate safely at half-second headways. Using the above figures, capacities above 10,000 passengers per hour <b>seem</b> <b>in</b> reach.|$|E

25|$|In {{this respect}} {{the duties of}} the vicar are of primary importance, since a {{multitude}} of ecclesiastics {{from all parts of the}} world pursue their studies at Rome and receive orders there on presentation of the required authorization of their respective bishops. For every order conferred at Rome there is a special examination conducted by a body of twenty-five learned ecclesiastics from the secular and the regular clergy, which operates in sections of three. Orders are regularly conferred on the days prescribed by ecclesiastical law and in the cathedral of the Bishop of Rome, i. e. in the Lateran Basilica; they may, however, be conferred on other days and in other churches or chapels. They are usually conferred either by the vicar himself or by the vicesgerens; by special delegation from the vicar, however, another bishop may occasionally ordain candidates. For the rights of the cardinals to ordain in their own churches (tituli, diaconia) see Cardinal. By a general pontifical indult any bishop resident in Rome may administer the Sacrament of Confirmation, it being still customary at Rome to confirm all children who <b>seem</b> <b>in</b> danger of death.|$|E
25|$|From {{the death}} of Augustus (14 AD) until after 70 AD, Rome {{accepted}} as her Germanic frontier the water-boundary of the Rhine and upper Danube. Beyond these rivers she held only the fertile plain of Frankfurt, opposite the Roman border fortress of Moguntiacum (Mainz), the southernmost slopes of the Black Forest and a few scattered bridge-heads. The northern section of this frontier, where the Rhine is deep and broad, remained the Roman boundary until the empire fell. The southern part was different. The upper Rhine and upper Danube are easily crossed. The frontier which they form is inconveniently long, enclosing an acute-angled wedge of foreign territory between the modern Baden and Württemberg. The Germanic populations of these lands <b>seem</b> <b>in</b> Roman times to have been scanty, and Roman subjects from the modern Alsace-Lorraine had drifted across the river eastwards. The motives alike of geographical convenience and of the advantages {{to be gained by}} recognising these movements of Roman subjects combined to urge a forward policy at Rome, and when the vigorous Vespasian had succeeded Nero, a series of advances began which gradually closed up the acute angle, or at least rendered it obtuse.|$|E
500|$|These entertainments, which {{begin in}} the month of May, are {{continued}} every night. They bring together persons of all ranks and conditions; and amongst these, a considerable number of females, whose charms want only that cheerful air, which is the flower and quintessence of beauty. These places serve equally as a rendezvous either for business or intrigue. They form, as it were, private coteries; there you see fathers and mothers, with their children, enjoying domestic happiness in the midst of public diversions. The English assert, that such entertainments as these can never subsist in France, on account of the levity of the people. Certain it is, that those of Vauxhall and Ranelagh, which are guarded only by outward decency, are conducted without tumult and disorder, which often disturb the public diversions of France. I do not know whether the English are gainers thereby; the joy which they <b>seem</b> <b>in</b> search of at those places does not beam through their countenances; they look as grave at Vauxhall and Ranelagh as at the Bank, at church, or a private club. All persons there seem to say, what a young English nobleman said to his governor, Am I as joyous as I should be? ...|$|E

500|$|The dance {{adaptation}} received mixed reviews. [...] The earliest {{review of}} the London production by The New York Times in November 2005 said that like the film version, [...] "doomed love story remains bittersweet". Matt Wolf of The New York Times panned the original run with statements such as [...] "a potential dance sensation seems peculiarly short on actual dance" [...] and [...] "But a dream ballet {{late in the first}} act and various set pieces later <b>seem,</b> <b>in</b> terms of actual choreography, oddly pro forma for Bourne[...] [...]" [...] He felt that overcoming the obstacle of choreographing dances around a lead with blades for fingers was too much to overcome. A fellow critic from The New York Times described it as [...] "visually alluring" [...] two weeks later. [...] On its Christmas2008 return to England, The Times gave the show a positive review: [...] "Matthew Bourne's adaptation of Tim Burton's 1990 film {{is one of the biggest}} and brightest of this season's glut of cultural ornaments. Indeed, so much skill has been lavished on this dance-theatre show for Bourne's company, New Adventures, that it almost feels churlish to withhold my affections." [...] The Independents reviewer was critical, saying [...] "Edward is more kids' cartoon than satire, with two-dimensional characters that stand a hair's breadth from cliché". Another critic from The Independent opened her review as follows: [...] "The best part of Matthew Bourne's Edward Scissorhands is the curtain call." [...] However, contemporaneous reviews by The Guardian were a bit more positive saying that [...] "Bourne is a natural storyteller, who never leaves his audience behind".|$|E
500|$|In {{the third}} Test, Bradman made the highest {{individual}} score in a Test match by scoring 334 out of Australia's 566. Assisted by rain that shortened the available playing time, England drew the match. Chapman scored 45 in his only innings. The fourth Test match was also badly affected by rain which brought about another draw. Chapman now faced further {{criticism of his}} captaincy. His field placings were again queried; Warner noted that Chapman's tactics were poor {{and that he was}} slow to react to the opposition. According to cricket writer Leo McKinstry, the selectors lost faith in Chapman on account of his inconsistent, risky batting and his increased tactical shortcomings. However, McKinstry also writes that the selectors and other influential members of the cricketing establishment were privately concerned by Chapman's heavy drinking which they felt was affecting his leadership. There were also rumours that he was drunk during some sessions of the fourth Test. Following an extended meeting of the selectors, Chapman was left out of the side and replaced as captain by Bob Wyatt. The press were united in attacking the decision, praising Chapman's batting and captaincy while denigrating Wyatt's lack of experience. Gibson observes: [...] "In 1930, despite the occasional criticisms, Chapman's position did not <b>seem</b> <b>in</b> any danger. He was still the popular, boyish, debonair hero. He had been having his most successful series with the bat, and as a close fieldsman England still did not contain his equal. He could not seriously be blamed because the English bowlers could not get Bradman out (though this was perhaps more apparent in retrospect than at the time). Wyatt, though nothing was known against him... was a figure markedly lacking in glamour." ...|$|E
2500|$|Founded by Pope Paul III in 1542, the congregation's sole {{objective}} is to [...] "spread sound Catholic doctrine and defend those points of Christian tradition which <b>seem</b> <b>in</b> danger because of new and unacceptable doctrines." [...] Its headquarters are at the Palace of the Holy Office, just outside Vatican City. The congregation employs an advisory board including cardinals, bishops, priests, lay theologians, and canon lawyers.

This would <b>seem</b> <b>in</b> many case to be a misnomer as applied to the modem language of Kashghar". Sven Hedin wrote, [...] "In these cases it would be particularly inappropriate to normalize to the East Turkish literary language, because by so doing one would obliterate traces of national elements which have no immediate connection with the Kaschgar Turks, but on the contrary are possibly derived from the ancient Uigurs".|$|E
2500|$|There is {{indication}} that Hathaway {{may have been}} financially secure in her own right. The National Archives states that [...] "beds and other pieces of household furniture were often the sole bequest to a wife" [...] and that, customarily, the children would receive the best items and the widow the second-best. In Shakespeare's time, the beds of prosperous citizens were expensive affairs, sometimes equivalent in value to a small house. The bequest was thus not as minor as it might <b>seem</b> <b>in</b> modern times. In Elizabethan custom the best bed {{in the house was}} reserved for guests. If so, then the bed that Shakespeare bequeathed to Anne could have been their marital bed, and thus not intended to insult her.|$|E
2500|$|The {{definition}} of a contract propounded by Chief Justice Marshall was {{not as simple as}} it may <b>seem.</b> <b>In</b> 1819, the Court considered whether a corporate charter could be construed as a contract. The case of Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward involved Dartmouth College, which had been established under a Royal Charter granted by King George III. The Charter created a board of twelve trustees for the governance of the College. In 1815, however, New Hampshire passed a law increasing the board's membership to twenty-one with the aim that public control could be exercised over the College. The Court, including Marshall, ruled that New Hampshire could not amend the charter, which was ruled to be a contract since it conferred [...] "vested rights" [...] on the trustees.|$|E

2500|$|In 1934, {{during a}} trip to Hollywood, Pascal was {{contacted}} by Princess Norina Matchabelli (wife of the perfume manufacturer) about a film project based on the teachings of Meher Baba. Pascal became very interested in this project, bringing writers Hy Kraft and Karl Vollmöller into helping him work up treatments and even making a trip to India to discuss the project further with Meher Baba. By the time Pascal arrived in India, however, Meher Baba did not <b>seem</b> <b>in</b> any hurry to complete the film, saying it could wait and inviting Pascal to travel with him in India. Most ordinary men would have been discouraged, but Pascal took energetically to the austere life of an eastern ascetic, even shedding his western garb for eastern clothing. He took a liking to Meher Baba and maintained a correspondence with him {{for the rest of his}} life. Meher Baba nicknamed Pascal his [...] "Phoenix" [...] and alternately his [...] "Black Panther." [...] Pascal was one of the few people Meher Baba named as a genius, a short list which included Friedrich Nietzsche and the Dutch filmmaker Louis van Gasteren.|$|E
