500|$|... 6th Airborne Division {{would be}} dropped in a <b>single</b> <b>lift,</b> unlike Operation Market Garden, and was {{to seize the}} high ground north {{of the town of}} Bergen, capture the town of Hamminkeln and several bridges over the river IJssel, and then hold the {{northern}} portion of the operational area until relieved by Allied ground forces. The division would use 440 gliders for the operation, which included a large number of the new Horsa Mark II and 48 Hamilcars. The loads assigned to the Hamilcars were similar to those used during Operation Market Garden, with sixteen of the gliders transporting 17-pounder anti-tank guns, as well as their vehicles and crews. Twelve were assigned to 716th Airborne Light Composite Company of the Royal Army Service Corps, and were loaded with twelve Universal Carriers, trailers and stores of ammunition and equipment. The company were to use the Universal Carriers and trailers, along with transport to be provided by 6th Airlanding Brigade, to collect, control and issue supplies dropped by aerial resupply drops to the airborne troops as they fought. Eight Hamilcars were to transport M22 Locust light tanks which belonged to 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment, and another four were to carry panniers of supplies. Two more were to carry a single Royal Engineers D4 bulldozer each, and finally 3rd Parachute Brigade and 5th Parachute Brigade were assigned three Hamilcars each; these would each carry a Universal Carrier for use as transport by the headquarters staff of the brigades.|$|E
