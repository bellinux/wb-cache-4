500|$|Beyoncé {{performed}} [...] "Dangerously in Love" [...] {{live for}} the first time at the Pepsi Arena in Albany, New York in 2001. The performance was also part of the setlist for their World Tour. Beyoncé also famously performed the song at the 2004 Grammy Awards on February 8, 2004, where it won in the category of Best Female R Vocal Performance. Beyoncé was wearing a long, glittery turquoise and silver dress. She positioned herself between the edges of a giant picture frame and sung [...] "Dangerously in Love 2" [...] as if she were in a living oil painting. She was joined by seventeen backup singers, musicians and dancers. At the end, <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> and a dove landed in her outstretched palm. Jon Wiederhorn of MTV News commented that the performance was [...] "nothing short of extravagant." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>her</b> finger warningly. I heard heavy {{footsteps}} {{outside and}} {{the rattle of}} the doorhandle.|$|R

60|$|Her finger {{pressed the}} bell. He {{took a quick}} step forward. <b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> He had {{destroyed}} her pity. Henceforth he was obnoxious to her.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>her</b> hand; {{he kissed}} it with affectionate gallantry, though he hardly {{knew how to}} look, and they entered the house.|$|R

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>her</b> hands, swaying {{a little}} towards him. He gripped them in his. She yielded to their {{pressure}} until their lips almost met.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>her</b> {{twitching}} {{hands as}} she spoke. Then she passed {{one of them}} through Jim's arm, and walked with him up the path.|$|R
