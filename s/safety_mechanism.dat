5|$|Later in August, Alabama {{departed}} for the Pacific theater; {{the ship was}} assigned to the US Third Fleet during the amphibious operations in the Gilbert islands, particularly Kwajalein in early 1944. During the night of 21 February 1944, Alabamas 5-inch guns were firing upon Japanese aircraft in the area. The ship turned {{in the direction of the}} Japanese aircraft in order to better engage them, but the rearmost turret was masked behind the amidships mount. The gunner in the rearmost turret accidentally overrode the <b>safety</b> <b>mechanism</b> that prevented the gun from firing in that circumstance, and when the gun was fired, it hit the 5-inch turret in front of it. Five men were killed and 11 wounded in the incident; an investigation revealed that the override switch was faulty and prone to accidental operation.|$|E

25|$|The Ruger P-Series {{is a line}} of {{centerfire}} semi-automatic pistols made by Sturm, Ruger & Company {{produced from}} 1985 to 2013. The P-Series pistols were designed for military, police, civilian and recreational use. The designs are largely based on the Browning action found in the M1911 pistol, but with minor variations, generally related to the <b>safety</b> <b>mechanism</b> and the barrel-camblock interface. Reviews have considered them rugged, reliable, and strong, though this strength comes {{at the price of}} bulk and a blocky appearance.|$|E

25|$|In practice, no gag is {{effective}} enough to silence someone completely without inhibiting breathing. Most gags that prevent the subject from making intelligible speech still permit loud, inarticulate noises {{to call for}} help. Thus, a pattern of noises, such as three grunts in rapid succession, is sometimes used as a safeword by BDSM players. It is also common to use an additional non-verbal <b>safety</b> <b>mechanism,</b> such as a solid object held in the hand that can be released by the gagged person to signal distress.|$|E
25|$|The rocket flew {{across the}} flight deck, {{striking}} a wing-mounted external fuel tank on an A-4E Skyhawk awaiting launch, aircraft No. 405 from VA-46, piloted by Lieutenant Commander Fred D. White. The Zuni rocket's warhead <b>safety</b> <b>mechanism</b> prevented it from detonating, but the impact tore the tank off the wing and ignited the resulting spray of escaping JP-5 fuel, causing an instantaneous conflagration. Within seconds, other external fuel tanks on White's aircraft overheated and ruptured, releasing more jet fuel {{to feed the}} flames, which began spreading along the flight deck.|$|E
25|$|Tidal {{power can}} have effects on marine life. The {{turbines}} can accidentally kill swimming sea {{life with the}} rotating blades, although projects {{such as the one}} in Strangford feature a <b>safety</b> <b>mechanism</b> that turns off the turbine when marine animals approach. Some fish may no longer utilize the area if threatened with a constant rotating or noise-making object. Marine life is a huge factor when placing tidal power energy generators in the water and precautions are made to ensure that as many marine animals as possible will not be affected by it. The Tethys database provides access to scientific literature and general information on the potential environmental effects of tidal energy.|$|E

25|$|As safety precautions, the {{built-in}} fuse for the warhead is released by a <b>safety</b> <b>mechanism.</b> This arms the warhead after a flight distance of approximately five meters. Once armed, the warhead will detonate on impact, {{and as a}} safety when the rocket's propellant runs out. This safeguards against live ammunition staying around and causing hazards to all in the future. The Panzerfaust 3 is distributed in a special package including spare parts and a cleaning kit. The package contains a launcher, ejector and spring, extractor, dummy extractor plug, bolt-head retaining pin, plastic cleaning rod with brass tip, bore and chamber brushes, camel's hair brush and a prismatic bore scope. It takes several minutes to assemble and load the launcher.|$|E
25|$|Some systems, {{known as}} {{millivolt}} control systems, extend the thermocouple concept to both {{open and close}} the main gas valve as well. Not only does the voltage created by the pilot thermocouple activate the pilot gas valve, it is also routed through a thermostat to power the main gas valve as well. Here, a larger voltage is needed than in a pilot flame safety system described above, and a thermopile is used rather than a single thermocouple. Such a system requires no external source of electricity for its operation and thus can operate during a power failure, provided that all the other related system components allow for this. This excludes common forced air furnaces because external electrical power is required to operate the blower motor, but this feature is especially useful for un-powered convection heaters. A similar gas shut-off <b>safety</b> <b>mechanism</b> using a thermocouple is sometimes employed {{to ensure that the}} main burner ignites within a certain time period, shutting off the main burner gas supply valve should that not happen.|$|E
25|$|Estimates of Gabilondo Ruby {{production}} {{are between}} 250,000 and 300,000 pistols in total. While most Gabilondo produced pistols were of good quality, others were less well made. French officials quickly {{became aware that}} few of the Spanish Ruby-types had interchangeable magazines, and insisted the manufacturers mark the base of all magazines. This was to prevent the possibly fatal consequence at {{the front line of}} either not being able to insert a new magazine, or having a loaded magazine detach from the gun in action. Many Ruby-types were plagued by poor finish and incorrectly hardened steel parts which after a short period of use wore so badly that pistols fired on full-auto. On other pistols, the <b>safety</b> <b>mechanism</b> wore out. The good quality Rubies were reliable and accurate, although some users were disconcerted by the lack of a visible hammer. About 710,000 Ruby types were accepted by the French from all sources and by 1920, about 580,000 were still serviceable and in French army stores. Many other allied nations, and some of the new nations created after the War such as Finland and Yugoslavia also used Ruby-type pistols. Gabilondo ceased production in 1919 and switched to more advanced models, but other firms continued to produce the Ruby-type until the Great Depression wiped out many arms producers.|$|E

50|$|There is an {{inherent}} {{risk in the}} performance of all stunt work. The most risk exists when performing stunts in front of a live audience. In filmed performances, visible <b>safety</b> <b>mechanisms</b> can be removed by editing. In live performances the audience can see more clearly if the performer is genuinely doing what they claim or appear to do. To reduce the risk of injury or death, most often stunts are choreographed or mechanically-rigged so that, while they look dangerous, <b>safety</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are built into the performance. Despite their well-choreographed appearance, stunts are still very dangerous and physically testing exercises.|$|R
5000|$|Two Mark 39 {{nuclear bombs}} were carried by a B-52 Stratofortress that broke {{up in the}} air and crashed near Goldsboro, North Carolina on January 24, 1961. According to Parker F. Jones, a {{supervisor}} of nuclear safety at Sandia National Laboratories, in a 1969 report that was declassified in 2013, the Mark 39 bomb had four <b>safety</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> one of which was not effective in the air. On one of the bombs involved, two more <b>safety</b> <b>mechanisms</b> were [...] "rendered ineffective by aircraft breakup." [...] As a result, Jones noted that the bomb was prevented from detonating only by the fourth mechanism, a simple [...] "ready-safe" [...] electric switch.|$|R
2500|$|A replicant is {{a fictional}} {{bioengineered}} or biorobotic android in the 1982 film Blade Runner, in its 2017 sequel Blade Runner 2049, {{and in the}} 1997 video game based on the film. The 'Nexus' series of replicants are virtually identical to adult humans, but have superior strength, speed, agility, resilience, and intelligence to varying degrees depending on the model. [...] Thus a replicant can only be detected {{by means of the}} fictional Voight-Kampff test, in which emotional responses are provoked; replicants’ nonverbal responses differ from humans'. Nexus 6 replicants also have a <b>safety</b> <b>mechanism,</b> namely a four-year lifespan, to prevent them from developing empathic abilities (and, therefore, immunity to the test). Replicants are sometimes referred to by the slur [...] "skin-job".|$|E
2500|$|Direct {{microwave}} {{exposure is}} not generally possible, as microwaves emitted by the source {{in a microwave}} oven are confined in the oven by the material out of which the oven is constructed. Furthermore, ovens are equipped with redundant safety interlocks, which remove power from the magnetron if the door is opened. This <b>safety</b> <b>mechanism</b> is required by United States federal regulations. Tests have shown confinement of the microwaves in commercially available ovens to be so nearly universal as to make routine testing unnecessary. According to the United States Food and Drug Administration's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, a U.S. Federal Standard limits the amount of microwaves that can leak from an oven throughout its lifetime to 5 milliwatts of microwave radiation per square centimeter at approximately [...] (2 in) {{from the surface of}} the oven. This is far below the exposure level currently considered to be harmful to human health.|$|E
2500|$|If the {{operator}} did not assemble enough characters, the line will not justify correctly: {{even with the}} spacebands expanded all the way, the matrices are not tight.

If a squirt did occur, it was generally up to the operator to grab the hell bucket and catch the flowing lead. It was so called because the bucket would often [...] "go to hell", or melt, while holding the molten lead that was still extremely hot. Also, in conjunction with possible hazards facing an operator, toxic lead fumes were possible, as they were the result of melting the lead ingots for casting.|$|E

From that, either Peoples or his daughter (each would recall later it was the other) coined the term replicant, which was inserted into Hampton Fancher's screenplay.|$|E
2500|$|The rising {{commercial}} {{success of the}} Rally package made VAM ascend it to a trim level for 1972 and with that several improvements followed. The <b>safety</b> <b>mechanism</b> connecting the shifter to the ignition switch was discontinued, which meant the incorporation of a small safety lever {{on the side of}} the column to keep the ignition switch from accidentally turning into lock position with the vehicle in motion. The previously optional 8000 RPM tachometer became standard equipment along with AMC's new three-arm three-spoke sports steering wheel with a central cylindrical button. Low-back, smaller more bucket-like front reclining seats replaced the wide units of the previous two years, which meant a free space between both units over the transmission tunnel. The round floor shift base shared with 1968-1969 Javelins departed in favor of a new squared design. The bright rear panel got an aluminum turned appearance and the taillight lenses featured a new larger backup light and side stripes. The grille was changed from aluminum to plastic and an updated hood latch appeared. Mechanically, the front sway bar was passed on to the standard equipment list, but the biggest change of the year was present under the hood. The 1972 Rally engine was the VAM 252 six producing [...] at 4,600 rpm, 9.5:1 compression ratio, with a high-flow Carter RBS-PV1 single-barrel carburetor and the 266 degree camshaft, which was originally used in 1969-1970 VAM Javelins. Due to this, the [...] "232 SIX" [...] emblems were removed in favor of new [...] "252" [...] units.|$|E
