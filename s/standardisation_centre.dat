Although {{acoustic}} systems {{are increasingly being}} used for environmental and noise surveys of marine energy devices, there are currently no standard protocols for the on-site full bandwidth calibration of these systems. Reports often include little or no information on the methods of calibration used before, during or after surveys. Without proper calibration, the sound levels may be far from accurate, leading to skewed reporting and inaccurate conclusions. Hydrophone calibrations from internationally recognised <b>standardisation</b> <b>centres,</b> such as NPL, allow providers to reference their systems to international standards. Marine renewable energy devices, however, are often deployed in remote areas {{and it is not}} always practical or cost-effective to send every acoustic system to be independently tested before every deployment. On-site referencing of multiple units to a single standardised system can help improve calibration traceability. Although this may at first appear relatively simple, the production of an accurate, full-spectrum calibration, particularly in real-world test sites, is surprisingly difficult...|$|R

Although well validated in terms of diagnostic accuracy, state-of-the-art prostate MRI is based on a multiparametric approach combining anatomic and functional imaging, which represents a costly, time consuming, and somewhat poorly patient-centred standard.|$|R
30|$|In Europe, the {{implementation}} of laparoscopy in daily practice varies largely according to the country, and most universities, and their teaching hospitals, do not offer residents a structured in-house training programme to acquire LPS prior to their training in the operating room. On the contrary, specific courses to improve laparoscopic skills are provided at specialised centres. However, {{due to the lack}} of <b>standardisation,</b> these <b>centres</b> follow different programmes with ambiguous objectives (only exposure vs full acquisition of the theoretical knowledge and practical familiarity with a specific technique) and under-documented results (e.g. hours of training and number of procedures required to reach proficiency). Furthermore, most of these programmes are not scientifically validated, do not address the specific training required for the acquisition of LPS, and do not take into consideration individuals’ learning patterns.|$|R

The {{research project}} analysed the activities undertaken by key stakeholders involved, in particular: research and development groups from industry, government agencies and academia, and leading standards experts involved in the field or in closely related areas. The analysis focused on describing existing or potential forms of relations between standardization and innovation, understanding the dynamics, attitudes and perceptions of the concerned parties, considering in detail success stories and failures, and from this information, conclude with recommendations on how to establish and exploit synergies between R&D and standardization.

40|$|Standardisation is a {{means of}} {{co-ordinating}} technology diffusion in a way that preserves compatibility. It is in essence an ex ante market mechanism, which levels the playing ground of product and service developers. Its primary value for software developers, users and its importance for public ICT policy developers lies in the positive externalities that derive from compatibility. But need these externalities be achieved by formal standardisation? I this paper I explore and compare the compatibility effects of de facto standards, quasi-open source software developments and- indirect means of- formal <b>standardisation.</b> I <b>centre</b> the comparison on the Java technology, which is currently one of the key technologies in the field of ICT. Sun's compatibility strategies regarding Java illustrate a whole range of options: proprietary de facto (licensing and open source software), gated-multiparty, consortium, and international formal standardisation. Sun tries to combine wide involvement of developers with cross-platform compatibility. Overall, its efforts have resulted in market co-ordination- although not without costs. Could formal standardisation bodies also have achieved this outcome? 1 The empirical material to be used is more or less complete (the references, in particular the websites, are not). The conceptual framework still needs further polishing- and extra (re-) reading. Comments are welcome. M...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a sea change in the field of hand prosthetics, an {{increasing}} number of clinicians and researchers have a desire to be able to objectively measure the functional effectiveness of a prosthesis, or the ability of a user with their device. The problem has been that there are many tools to measure the function of hands and arms, but few seem appropriate to prosthetics. Also the tools that do exist seem to have conflicting aims and methods, so it is hard to choose the appropriate test. If practitioners have no meaningful way to test if a device is better for one user (compared with another device), they have no easy way to demonstrate to funders or providers that one solution is more effective than any other. Similarly, they lack a common language to simply pass on their professional judgement to their colleagues. What does exist is an array of different tools for measuring different aspects of prosthetic design, function and use. There is little <b>standardisation</b> between <b>centres</b> in the same country, let alone across borders and seas. Worse, there is evidence that existing techniques are being invalidated (conceivably through ignorance, and definitely due to pressures of time to conduct a truly systematic study). To save time, or effort, fully validated tests are being shortened, or favoured sub tests are being selected from the greater whole, so that the results obtained are incomplete, invalid, or simply wrong...|$|R
40|$|Progressive cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) lung disease {{is the main}} cause of mortality in CF patients. CF lung disease starts in early childhood. With current standards of care, respiratory function remains largely normal in children and more sensitive outcome measures are needed to monitor early CF lung disease. Chest CT is currently the most sensitive imaging modality to monitor pulmonary structural changes in children and adolescents with CF. To quantify structural lung disease reliably among multiple <b>centres,</b> <b>standardisation</b> of chest CT protocols is needed. SCIFI CF (Standardised Chest Imaging Framework for Interventions and Personalised Medicine in CF) was founded to characterise chest CT image quality and radiation doses among 16 participating European CF centres in 10 different countries. We aimed to optimise CT protocols in children and adolescents among several CF centres. A large variety was found in CT protocols, image quality and radiation dose usage among the centres. However, the performance of all CT scanners was found to be very similar, when taking spatial resolution and radiation dose into account. We conclude that multicentre standardisation of chest CT in children and adolescents with CF can be achieved for future clinical trials...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Com.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2005. This {{research}} paper presents a systems and process approach into the development, implementation and certification of ISO 9001 : 2000 within the Industry Association Resource Centre, (IARC) formally known as Distribution Technology (DT). There is currently no formal Quality Management System (QMS) applied {{within the bounds}} of IARC. ISO 9001 : 2000 is one such system that is to be implemented to ensure that the products and or services as generated by IARC meet the customers expectations and within the required time frame. Due to the restructuring of the EDI and disbanding of Distribution, DT was relocated from the disbanding Distribution division and incorporated into the R & S division. In doing so DT was restructured and the name changed to IARC. This meant that Risk Management a previous section within DT was moved out and three new sections, <b>Standardisation,</b> Information <b>Centre</b> and the Electricity Supply Industry - Geographic Information System were incorporated into IARC. The three new sections had previously been with R & S and were already ISO 9001 : 2000 certified. IARC is currently split into eight sections namely; • Technology Development, Power Plant, • Technology Development, Control Plant, • Engineering Processes, • Technical Training, • Pre-Paid Development, • Technology Standardisation, • Information Services and • Electricity Supply Industry - Geographic Information System. There is also however a Corporate Consulting Service supplied by IARC. IARC is further spread throughout the country and thus has multiple offices namely; • Megawatt Park (Johannesburg) • Menlyn Park (Pretoria) • New Germany (Durban) • Brakenfel (Cape Town) • Simmerpan (Germiston) • East London • Klerksdorp • George. As can be seen from above IARC is a department that is multi skilled and spread through out the country hence the importance of implementing a quality management system. A method of developing and implementing ISO 9001 : 2000 within IARC will be discussed. This {{research paper}} will further only involve five of the sections within IARC as three of the sections as stated above have already achieved ISO 9001 : 2000 certification [...] Thus the five sections that form part of this research paper are; • Technology Development, Power Plant, • Technology Development, Control Plant, • Engineering Processes, • Technical Training and • Pre-Paid Development. The sections within IARC have in the past worked in isolation from each other and thus have built up their own reporting systems to which they adhere to. It is thus recommended to involve the relevant staffthroughout the entire IARC and to ensure that they fully understand the benefits that can be achieved with certification. It is further important to understand that extensive training be undertaken throughout IARC during the process to educate all staff...|$|R
40|$|Background Research {{has shown}} that {{healthcare}} organisations can cause harm to patients, much of which is avoidable, and there is reliable {{evidence to suggest that}} this harm is a widespread and recurring phenomena (Institute of Medicine 1999; Department of Health 2000; Leape et al 2002; de Vries et al 2008; Longtin et al 2009; Jha et al 2010). Encouraging patients to {{take an active role in}} their own healthcare was identified in the landmark patient safety publication ‘To Err is Human’ (Institute of Medicine 2000) as a vital factor in the quest to improve patient safety. It has since been contended that if patients were involved in their healthcare they could help to further reduce opportunities for accidents and errors during the course of their care (Vincent and Coulter 2002; Koutantji et al 2005; Weingart et al 2005; Unruh and Pratt 2006; Davis et al 2007). More recently, there has been growing interest in the development and use of interventions to promote and support patients’ roles in securing their own safety in healthcare contexts (Hall et al 2010; Longtin et al 2010; Peat et al 2010; Doherty and Stavropoulou 2012; Vaismoradi et al 2014). Aims The broad aim of this study is to explore the extent to which patients are involved in attempts to improve their own healthcare safety through enrolment in an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) programme. Recognising that patient safety is just one aspect of the ERAS programme theory, this research evaluates those elements of the programme that see patients taking a role in their own healthcare safety. This is achieved by considering in realist terms the mechanisms of effect by which patients might contribute to their healthcare safety and investigating the conditions and circumstances (contexts) that are required to enable this involvement. The overall aim of this research is to seek out regularities in the patterns of these contexts and mechanisms which result in patient involvement in patient safety. The emerging theory will explain implementation variations, and the experiences of the programme participants in the different cases will provide an opportunity to make comparisons with initial programme theories, the objective being to better understand when and why patient involvement in patient safety works in an ERAS programme. Methods The underpinning methodological framework for this research is realist evaluation (Pawson and Tilley 1997), which is a technique concerned with exploring the interaction among context, mechanism and outcome, based on the realist principle of generative causation. This study uses an in-depth multiple case study approach, with each of the three surgical units under study purposively selected to represent involvement in the ERAS programme. To capture the complex and dynamic nature of the programme under investigation, the study draws on a wide range of empirical data sources, methods and materials, including ethnographic observations, semi-structured interviews and document analysis. Taking ‘early mobilisation’ as a tracer outcome, the study examines the mechanisms and contexts involved in programme outcomes in relation to patient involvement in patient safety. The first stage of the enquiry involves eliciting and formalising the programme theories relating to patient involvement in patient safety in an ERAS programme which are then articulated in conjectured context-mechanism-outcome configurations (CMO) terms. The next stage involves collecting data that will allow interrogation of these hypotheses, comparing the programme’s intentions with case study data of actual practice that occurred and the views and experiences of key stakeholders, including patients and nursing staff. This is followed by cross case comparisons which attempt to determine how the same mechanisms played out in different contexts. Key findings Overall, the findings show that there are many contextual factors relating to the successful outcomes of the programme theories postulated. The key findings of this study demonstrate that successful patient involvement in patient safety related elements of an ERAS programme requires that: ward staffs are aligned with the programme objectives; that patients’ expectations for their post-operative recovery are managed prior to surgery and the underlying rationale for their care is understood and; in the post-operative period patients’ enrolment in the programme is sustained and reinforced by ward based staff. The study also demonstrates how differences in the implementation of ERAS across the study sites, support for early mobilisation and individual patient differences (for example emotional status and operation type) were consequential for the outcomes of the programme theory. Conclusion This thesis sits at the interface of a number of health policy and quality improvement trends including patient involvement, patient safety, <b>standardisation,</b> patient <b>centred</b> care, co-production and the growing interest in healthcare with the implementation and embedding of interventions. The aspirations of policy and programme documentation to ‘empower’ patients to take a more active role in their care also proved more complex in reality. The study highlights the tensions between achieving a quality standard and patient centred care and how the approach to postoperative care in the three different case study sites shaped nurses’ willingness to adapt the programme and support patient involvement. The main areas for consideration from this study include the importance of the role of healthcare staff in attempts to involve patients in patient safety, along with the tensions between standardisation of care versus the aspirations of providing person-centred, individual care for patients. This is considered in relation to the ongoing standardisation of healthcare through an increasing reliance on protocols and pathways, such as the ERAS programme...|$|R
