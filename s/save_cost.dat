25|$|Dubbing {{is still}} the norm and favored form in these four countries, but the {{proportion}} of subtitling is slowly growing, mainly to <b>save</b> <b>cost</b> and turnaround-time, but also due to a growing acceptance among younger generations, who are better readers and increasingly have a basic knowledge of English (the dominant language in film and TV) and thus prefer to hear the original dialogue.|$|E
25|$|In the 85D, {{the rear}} drive unit is {{replaced}} by a smaller one to <b>save</b> <b>cost</b> and weight, while the second motor of similar size is added to the front wheels. This results in an AWD car with comparable power and acceleration to the RWD version. Additionally, Tesla said the 85D has a 2% (5-mile) range increase and 11% increase in top speed over the 85. In the P85D, the high-power rear drive unit is retained, while a new front drive motor boosts the total power by about 50%. This results in a significant increase in acceleration and top speed. Deliveries of the P85D started in December 2014, with the 85D models starting in February 2015, and the 70D models starting in April 2015.|$|E
25|$|The grey Aberdeen granite Fullerton Building sits on 41,100 {{square metres}} (442,400 square feet) of land. The height of its walls {{measures}} 36.6 metres (120ft) from the ground. The building has Neo-classical architectural features {{which include a}} two-storey fluted Doric colonnades on their heavy base, and the lofty portico over the main entrance with trophy designs and the Royal Coat of Arms, crafted by Italian Cavaliere Rudolfo Nolli. Originally, there were five distinct frontages, each treated in the Doric order. 14 elevators served the four floors plus the basement floors. A hollow cellular raft foundation was proposed by the original contractors in the 1920s to <b>save</b> <b>cost</b> because bedrock lies directly below the building. The Fullerton Building also possesses {{the one and only}} barrel-vaulted, coffered ceiling in Singapore.|$|E

25|$|The {{reflectivity}} of {{a mirror}} {{is determined by the}} percentage of reflected light per the percentage of the incident light. The reflectivity may vary with wavelength. All or a portion of the light not reflected is absorbed by the mirror, while in some cases a portion may also transmit through. Although some small portion of the light will be absorbed by the coating, the reflectivity is usually higher for first-surface mirrors, eliminating both reflection and absorption losses from the substrate. The reflectivity is often determined by the type and thickness of the coating. When the thickness of the coating is sufficient to prevent transmission, all of the losses occur due to absorption. Aluminum will reflect 85 to 90% of the light in the visible to near-ultraviolet range, but is a poor reflector of infrared wavelengths longer than 800 nm. Gold is up to 96% reflective to near and far-infrared light between 800 and 12000 nm, but poorly reflects visible light with wavelengths shorter than 600 nm (yellow). Silver has the highest reflectivity in the visual to near-infrared of any metal, and can reflect up to 98 or 99% of light to wavelengths as long as 2000 nm, but loses nearly all reflectivity at wavelengths shorter than 350 nm. Dielectric mirrors can reflect greater than 99.99% of light, but only for a narrow range of wavelengths. However, dielectric coatings can also enhance the reflectivity of metallic coatings and protect them from scratching or tarnishing. In mirrors with low tolerances, the coating thickness may be reduced to <b>save</b> <b>cost,</b> and simply covered with paint to absorb transmission.|$|E
2500|$|Three of {{the four}} B-1A prototypes {{featured}} a single crew escape capsule for the crew members. For the fourth prototype and for the B-1B, this was changed to use conventional ejection seats. One source gives the reason [...] "due to concerns about servicing the pyrotechnical components of the system," [...] while another says this was done [...] "to <b>save</b> <b>cost</b> and weight." [...] On August 29, 1984, B-1A prototype #2 crashed and the capsule was ejected at low altitude. The parachute deployed improperly {{and one of the}} three crew died.|$|E
2500|$|Keytops are an {{important}} element of keyboards. In the beginning, keyboard keytops had a [...] "dish shape" [...] on top, like typewriters before them. Keyboard key legends must be extremely durable over tens of millions of depressions, since they are subjected to extreme mechanical wear from fingers and fingernails, and subject to hand oils and creams, so engraving and filling key legends with paint, as was done previously for individual switches, was never acceptable. So, for the first electronic keyboards, the key legends were produced by two-shot (or double-shot, or two-color) molding, where either the key shell or the inside of the key with the key legend was molded first, and then the other color molded second. But, to <b>save</b> <b>cost,</b> other methods were explored, such as sublimation printing and laser engraving, both methods which could be used to print a whole keyboard at the same time.|$|E
