40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a {{substantive}} theory for leading a change process towards achieving synergy between the business units of a globally diver-sified organisation. A modernist qualitative research methodology was followed. Casing was employed as research design. Grounded theory as proposed by Strauss and Corbin (1998) was applied as research strategy. Twenty seven employees were selected as research participants by means of purposive sampling. All the participants were selected on the basis of their in-volvement in synergy activities in the Company. In-depth interviews and re-quested essays were used as data collection methods to explore the twenty seven participants’ experiences with synergy. Two focus group interviews were addition-ally used as data collection methods. The nine participants in the first focus group interview were members of a regional <b>synergy</b> <b>committee.</b> The other focus group consisted of three executives of the Company. Participant observation was em-ployed as another data collection method during the focus group meetings as well as at one video conference on the establishment of a forum for recruitment and selection in the Company in which seven employees participated. The data was analysed by utilising the grounded theory methodology. After the conclusion of the data analysis phase, the first order constructs and re-lated concepts to synergy were further explored in the literature. A substantive theory for leading a change process towards achieving synergy was developed by aligning the conditional/ consequential matrix of Strauss & Corbin (1998) and the S-O-R theory of Partington (2000). Despite shortcomings the aim of the study was achieved. The study contributed to the development of theory, methodology and also contributed on a practical level.

50|$|The <b>committees</b> work in <b>synergy</b> {{with the}} <b>committees</b> of the Parliamentary Assembly and the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities. They issue {{statements}} on their demand or at own initiative. To strengthen this cooperation, the Parliamentary Assembly adopted, in November 2007, a resolution on the “Co-operation between the Parliamentary Assembly and the Conference of INGOs”, noting “with satisfaction {{that the work}} programme of the Conference of INGOs contains several major themes which {{are closely related to}} the priorities of the Assembly. On this basis, it is convinced that additional steps should be taken with a view to an enhanced co-operation aimed at further developing citizen participation and dialogue with civil society”.|$|R
40|$|The WA Chapter of AAEE {{has been}} {{presenting}} the Catchments, Corridors and Coasts (CCC) program for 13 years. Over {{this time it}} has evolved to become {{an important aspect of}} our work in the Western Australian community. CCC is a three day interactive program that provides a ‘snapshot’ of environmental education in WA. Participants come from community groups, youth organisations, teachers, preservice teachers, private sector, and local and state government. It provides a rich experience, facilitating the developments of networks with and between practitioners, and an awareness of the resources and support across WA to help address core environmental and sustainability issues. Participants learn about environmental issues, what is being done by community groups and various levels of government, what resources are available and how we can all work together for a better environment. The presentation outlines the elements of the program, the impact of the program for participants, the values of networking and the potential for developing skills and knowledge about sustainability issues. This program is very achievable for any group to replicate, enabling them to develop a community program that reflects and establishes synergies between the environmental education communities. The program demonstrates the <b>synergies</b> between the <b>committee</b> member’s organisations that represent government, community and education sector...|$|R
