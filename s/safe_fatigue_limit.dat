40|$|Material fatigue is {{a failure}} mode that {{has been known to}} {{researchers}} and engineers since the 19 th century. Catastrophic accidents have happened due to fatigue failures of structures, machinery and transport vehicles. The capsizing of the semisubmersible rig Alexander L. Kielland in Norwegians waters in 1980 killed 123 people, and investigations pointed at the fatigue failure of a weld as one of the direct causes. This accident led to a number of improvements to the design of offshore structures. The noticeable safety principle ”No single accident should lead to escalating consequences” has since been adopted in a widespread manner. Since 1992 the Petroleum Safety Authority in Norway has enforced a risk based safety regime. Wells are designed to hold back reservoir pressures and avoid uncontrolled escape of hydrocarbons. In other words a well is a pressure containing vessel. Norwegian safety regulations require a dual barrier construction of wells. This safety principle ensures that one “barrier” is preventing an escalating situation should the other barrier fail. A wellhead is a heavy walled pressure vessel placed {{at the top of the}} well. The wellhead is part of the second well barrier envelope during drilling. The subsea wellheads are located at sea bottom and during subsea drilling the Blow Out Preventer (BOP) is placed on top of the subsea wellhead. The drilling riser is the connection between the BOP and the floating drilling unit. Waves and current forces acting on the drilling riser and drilling unit will cause dynamic movement. Flexible joints at top and bottom of the drilling riser protects the drilling riser from localised bending moments. The subsea wellhead is both a pressure vessel and a structurally load bearing component resisting external loads transmitted from a connected riser. These external loads can be static and cyclic combinations of bending and tension (compression). Cyclic loads will cause fatigue damage to the well. The well can take a certain amount of fatigue damage without failing. A fatigue failure of a WH system may have serious consequences. Should the WH structurally fail its pressure vessel function will be lost and for this reason WH fatigue is a potential threat to well integrity. The structural load bearing function will also be affected. Wellhead fatigue analysis can be used as a tool to estimate the accumulated fatigue damage. Analysis results then compares to a <b>safe</b> <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit.</b> This thesis addresses selected aspects of fatigue damage estimations of subsea wellheads and surface casings. The presented work is a contribution to the fatigue analysis methodology currently being developed within the industry. The well cement role as a boundary condition for surface casings in analytical models is particularly addressed. The majority of research focuses on the casing shoe and formation sealing, which is the primary objective of well cementing. Recent research focus on the cement limits conditions e. g. elevated temperatures. The “near-seabed” conditions of lead cements have seen less scrutiny. Some researchers have shown interest in this issue related to deep water cementing. Deep water bottom temperature is low all year round regardless of location latitude. Low sea water temperatures will depress the normal thermal gradient of the upper parts of the soil. Subsea wells are typically cemented using a lead and tail cement system, and the lead top casing cement will be pumped all the way to seabed. This lead cement will then be left curing in a low temperature environment. Hydration of cement is an exothermic chemical reaction, and the reaction rate is dependent on temperature. Laboratory measurements of low temperature early compressive strength of typical lead cement slurries are presented herein. In the North Sea the duration between placement of surface casing lead cement and installation of BOP/drilling riser will typical be around 24 hrs. Then dynamic riser loads will start acting on the upper part of a subsea well. Bending of the well causes relative motions between the conductor and surface casing. The cement around these casings will experience these relative motions. The combination of delayed cement setting due to low temperature and surface casing motions will cause localized failure of cement bonding in the upper part of the well. In subsea wellhead fatigue analysis finite element models are used. Boundary conditions in analytical models are important in ensuring similar behaviour of model and reality. One boundary condition in wellhead models is the lateral cement support of the surface casing. Modelling this cement support as infinitely stiff with a discrete vertical transition is the existing solution. In this work a modified boundary condition is presented based on low curing temperatures in combination with “premature” loading of the supporting cement. An overall analysis methodology approach has been suggested. Using a detailed local model of the well to define the lower boundary condition for the global riser load analytical model is one of its features. The implementation of a modified cement boundary condition will change the global stiffness of the local well model. The possible effect on global riser load from variations to the lower boundary condition has been studied. The conclusion supports the suggested analysis approach. Overall well ultimate structural strength will be reduced by the presence of a fatigue crack in a non pressurised load bearing part of a subsea well. An analysis methodology with case results are presented and indicate that the location of a fatigue crack affects the reduction in ultimate strength. Cases of significant reduction are expected to impact normal operating limitations. To be able to include the wellhead fatigue failure mode in an overall risk management system, the failure probability needs to be estimated. This can be done by applying a structural reliability analysis methodology to the problem. A suggested structural analysis methodology approach is suggested and notational failure probabilities are presented. Future improvements to wellhead fatigue analysis may emerge from calibrations from measurements of the reality. A comparison between analytical fatigue loading and measured fatigue loading has been presented and results indicate that the analysis results are conservative. This is evidence that analytical estimate on acceptable fatigue limits can be trusted from a safety point of view. It also indicates the monetary potential that measurements can present to the well...|$|E

Scatter characteristics of <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit,</b> <b>fatigue</b> life and tensile strength for magnesium alloy were investigated in this study. At least 20 specimens were tested to obtain the scatter data of <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit,</b> <b>fatigue</b> life and tensile strength, respectively. The probability distributions of <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit,</b> <b>fatigue</b> life and tensile strength were evaluated by using Normal distribution and Weibull distribution function. The values of the Weibull modulus, m were 159, 10, 175 for <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit,</b> <b>fatigue</b> life and tensile strength, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that scatter of <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> is small and almost coincides with that of tensile strength, while scatter of fatigue life is significantly large compared to those of <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> and tensile strength. The large scatter of fatigue life will be due to crack nucleation and small crack growth processes, which strongly depend on local microstructure near the crack nucleation region...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHigh end {{applications}} {{often require}} high strength materials especially regarding the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit.</b> It {{is still an}} open question what the highest <b>fatigue</b> <b>limits</b> are and how to increase them further in high strength steels. A thermomechanical treatment (TMT) in the temperature range of maximal dynamic strain ageing is an auspicious way to increase the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of bearing steel SAE 52100. Successful attempts have been published for various materials states. The present investigation deals with the influence of non-metallic inclusions on the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> and the possibility to increase the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> by TMT. The <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of high strength steels increases by reducing {{the size of the}} non-metallic inclusions during steelmaking. We found that TMT increases the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of a high strength materials state only in cases in which the non-metallic inclusions are the starting points of the fatigue cracks. In the case of high cleanliness of the steel the origin of the fatigue cracks may be at any position in the matrix. If there are no critical non-metallic inclusions a TMT did not increase the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> further. The reasons for this behaviour will be explained and the border of the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of high strength steels will be discussed...|$|R

This model differs from previous ways of describing fatigue data for PVC by recognising that the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> is a stochastic quantity {{rather than a}} single valued stress amplitude below which fatigue failures will not occur. By analysing published fatigue data, it is demonstrated that the RFL model is capable of quantifying <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> variability and its influence on fatigue life variability. Moreover, the RFL model was used to illustrate {{the risks associated with}} defining <b>fatigue</b> <b>limits</b> based on small quantities of high-cycle fatigue data. In particular, it is shown that fatigue failure can occur below the mean <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> and that the RFL model is capable of quantifying the probability of failure at a given level of stress amplitude...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTo {{achieve a}} high <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> {{the most common}} {{approach}} {{is to increase the}} static strength and hardness of a material. This is realized mostly by decreasing microstructural dimensions as the grain size or the spacing between phases in more phase materials. According to the Hall-Petch-relationship the static strength is increased by that way. Simultaneously, the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit,</b> which is defined by the non-propagation of cracks, increases with decreasing microstructural dimensions. The reason is that microstructurally small cracks are stopped at microstructural barriers so that smaller distances between neighboring barriers reduce the length of non-propagating cracks and increase the intrinsic <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit.</b> But this increase of the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> is confined by the dimensions of the flaws within the material, such as non-metallic inclusions or geometrical notches, which reduce the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of high strength materials significantly. The trade-off between small microstructural dimensions and the dimensions of the flaws will be discussed on the basis of experimental results in three examples. Firstly, commercial pure titanium shows a distinct change of the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> not before the notches are larger than the grain sizes, although the stress intensity at the notches is significant [1]. Secondly, micro notches in high strength materials always result in a huge decrease of the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> [2]. Thirdly, as bulk metallic glasses do not possess microstructural barriers like grain boundaries notches are a crucial factor in this class of materials [3]. On the basis of these examples and the modified Kitagawa-Takahashi diagram [4] a new approach to explain the microstructure and notch influence on the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> will be presented. This could be the basis for future developments to increase the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of metals...|$|R

For circumferential-notched bars from steel C 45 it has been shown, that by adjusting the hardening depth and the surface hardness to the notch geometry and the applied load an increase in <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of about 200 per cent can be obtained. The local concept is useful for such optimization and for <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> assessment. In addition to the hardness and the hardening depth an explicit influence of the prior austenite grain size on the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> exists.

40|$|The {{traditional}} methods for fatigue characterization of metallic materials are expensive and extremely time consuming. In order {{to overcome these}} shortcomings, the Thermographic Method (TM), based on thermographic analysis, is applied to estimate the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of Al 2024. The temperature increase due to localized microplasticity is considered as the fatigue damage indicator. An experimental program is carried out to assess the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> both as resulting from the S–N field and, directly, from thermographic measurement. For the latter, three different methods are applied for the estimation of the AL 2024 <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> and the out-coming results discussed. The values of <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> predicted from the thermographic method according to the three methods are in good agreement to that derived from the traditional S-N procedure. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to propose a {{methodology}} to estimate the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of cylindrical contacts under a partial slip regime. Taylor’s point stress method, usually applied to estimate <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> for notched structures, {{was associated with the}} Modified Wöhler Curves to define the fretting crack initiation threshold methodology. Twenty-nine tests on cylindrical contacts were selected from the literature and considered to evaluate the quality of the estimates. The results agree well for twenty-three experimental data. As the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> under fully reversed bending is the fatigue parameter usually available for most metallic alloys, it was also showed how the second <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> needed to calibrate the proposed procedure could be estimated by taking full advantage from other standard predictive methodologies previously devised to estimate the mean stress effect under uniaxial fatigue loading...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} study, scatter {{behavior}} of <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> for the die-cast magnesium alloy AM 60 B was investigated. Twelve <b>fatigue</b> <b>limits</b> were determined based on S-N curves obtained {{according to the}} standard fatigue test methods. The scatter of <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> for the die-cast AM 60 B was large compared to the extruded AZ 61 : the values of Weibull modulus and COV were 16 and 6. 8, respectively, for the die-cast material, whereas those for the extruded one were 159 and 0. 7. The COV value of 0. 7 for the extruded AZ 61 meant that only 0. 7 % of scatter from the mean value {{was included in the}} <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> determined based on the S- N curve. This COV value was comparable to that of 0. 6 for the tensile strength of the same material. Therefore, the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> for the extruded material has small enough scatter to be considered as the material property similar to the tensile strength that can be determined from the average value of 2 - 3 samples...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the effect of defect {{orientation}} on the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of three types of steels; JIS-S 15 C, JIS-S 45 C and JIS-SNCM 439, a small semi-circular slit was introduced into {{the surface of a}} round specimen. The slits were tilted at 0 ∘, 30 ∘ or 60 ∘ with respect to the plane normal to the loading axis, but all of them had the same defect size, a⃗r⃗e⃗a⃗ See Formula in PDF = 188 [*]μm, where the area denotes the area of the domain defined by projecting the defect on a plane normal to the loading axis. In all the combinations of the materials and tilting angles, a non-propagating crack was found at the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit,</b> i. e. the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> was determined by the non-propagation condition of crack initiated from the defect. In JIS-S 15 C and JIS-S 45 C, the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> was nearly independent of the tilting angle, which was in good agreement with the predicted value by the a⃗r⃗e⃗a⃗ See Formula in PDF parameter model. On the other hand, in JIS-SNCM 439, the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> was also in agreement with the prediction at the tilting angle of 0 ∘, but it increased with an increase in the tilting angle. These results indicated that the a⃗r⃗e⃗a⃗ See Formula in PDF parameter model can predict a conservative <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> for the tilted defects. In this paper, the mechanistic reason for the effect of the tilting angle on the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> will be discussed by paying special attention to the crack path and length of non-propagating crack...|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{performed}} at Scania CV AB and aimed {{to optimize the}} effect of shot peening {{in order to increase}} the bending <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of planetary gears. In this project three parameters affecting the performance of the shot peening were examined in more detail, specifically the hardness of the shot peening media, the hardness of the material and the amount retained austenite. Shot peening and measurements were performed on carburized gears consisting of ss 92506 steel. In order to find out how the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> is affected by the material hardness, a number of gears were tempered whereas other remained untempered. Similarly the retained austenite content was altered in some of the gears with a cryotreatment. The shot peening of these gears {{was performed}} by dual shot peening using media of two different hardness. The <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> was evaluated by a servo hydraulic material testing machine. The results show that the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> is enhanced when the shot peening was performed with hard media. This was expected since the harder media can cause larger plastic deformation in the material giving rise to larger compressive residual stresses which is known to increase the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit.</b> The <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> was also improved for samples with lower surface hardness. The amount of retained austenite does not seem to affect the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> for samples shot peened with media of sufficient hardness in order to cause adequate plastic deformation. The surface roughness remained unchanged for samples shot peened by different media, which indicates that this parameter should not hinder a change of media...|$|R

40|$|Purpose】-The paper's {{aim is to}} {{investigate}} the effects of shot peening (SP) on the bending <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of high‐strength steel containing an artificial semi‐circular slit. 【Design/methodology/approach】-SP and stress SP (SSP) were conducted on the specimens containing an artificial semi‐circular slit with a depth of a= 0. 1, 0. 2 and 0. 3 [*]mm. Then, bending fatigue tests were conducted on the specimens. 【Findings】–The <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> was improved by SP and SSP. In the case of SP and SSP specimens, the specimens with a semi‐circular slit under a= 0. 2 [*]mm fractured outside the slit, and they had considerably high <b>fatigue</b> <b>limits.</b> Therefore, a semi‐circular slit with a depth of under a= 0. 2 [*]mm could be rendered harmless by SP or SSP.

40|$|Abstract. The {{application}} of infrared thermography {{to obtain the}} external surface temperature during the {{application of}} cyclic loading, allows to evaluate the dynamic behavior of an element and to determine the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit.</b> In this contribution, {{the reliability of the}} <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> provided by the Risitano et al. and Canteli et al. methodologies is investigated in order to check their validity for practical applications. With this aim, an experimental program on aluminium specimens (AL 2024) under load control using a stress ratio minus one is performed. The <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> for AL 2024 is derived, first from the Wöhler curve and then, compared with both Risitano et al. and Canteli et al. methodologies...|$|R
40|$|Fatigue is an {{irreversible}} process, {{accompanied by}} microstructural changes, localized plastic strains and energy dissipation. The temperature increase of a metallic material undergoing a fatigue test is {{a manifestation of}} the thermal energy dissipation and it was experimentally observed that the higher the applied stress amplitude the more pronounced the temperature increase of the material. Moreover, the trend of the observed temperature increase versus the applied stress amplitude presents a more or less abrupt positive change at a certain stress level. This characteristic stress amplitude was associated to the material <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> [1 - 7]. Since the load-increasing tests are fast and a single specimens can be used to estimate the material <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit,</b> Risitano and co-workers set-up a rapid experimental methodology to determine the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> based on load-increasing tests monitored with an infrared camera, according to the so-called Risitano method [5]. It is known that due to plasticity, the stress amplitude and the material temperature waves present a phase shift. Therefore, taking advantage of the lock-in thermography, temperature oscillations due to dissipated energy, T 2, can be obtained as the component having double frequency of the load signal sine wave by using the classical Fourier analysis, as suggest by Krapez et al [8]. They proposed to use T 2, instead of the stabilized material temperature measured during a fatigue test in order to estimate the material <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit.</b> However, they noticed that the applicability of the method depends on the material under analysis. In particular, satisfactory results were found in the case of AISI 1050 steel and AISI 316 L stainless steel, while the approach was useless while investigating the fatigue behavior of 7010 aluminum alloy, since temperature signal associated with the dissipated energy was very weak in relation to the available experimental equipment. Aaki et al [9] proposed to use the dissipated energy, evaluated by using the lock-in thermography, to assess the material <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit.</b> They pointed out that satisfactory results were found in the case of AISI 316 L, while in the case of AISI 304 the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> estimated by dissipated energy measurements provided a conservative value as compared to that evaluated by means of conventional fatigue test. The phase shift angle was proposed as a suitable damage index for the rapid determination of material <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> by Shiozawa et al [10]. They validated the approach against experimental results obtained from AISI 306 L stainless steel specimens and noticed a satisfactory agreement with the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> determined by the conventional stair-case tests. Recently, Shiozawa et al [11] proposed a new experimental technique for <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> estimation based on the phase 2 f lock-in infrared method, where a single fatigue test was performed on AISI 316 steel specimens by increasing the applied stress amplitude, a, and by measuring the in-creasing rate of the dissipated energy, dq/da. By plotting dq/da versus a, an abrupt increase is seen when a exceeds the material <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit.</b> Meneghetti [12] proposed an experimental technique for the direct evaluation of the heat energy density per cycle dissipated by a material undergoing a fatigue tests (the Q parameter). Q can be easily evaluated by stopping the fatigue test at t = t* after thermal equilibrium has been reached and by measuring the cooling gradient immediately after t*. Originally adopted to rationalise the notch effect in finite-life fatigue of stainless steel specimens [13], it is envisaged that the specific heat loss Q may be used also to estimate the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit.</b> This paper analyses all previous thermal methods for the rapid experimental estimation of the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit.</b> In particular, the rapid engineering techniques proposed by La Rosa and Risitano [5], by Shiozawa et al [10] as well as by using the Q parameter [12] will be applied to estimate the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of cold-drawn AISI 304 L stainless steel bars and critical issues in practical applications of the analysed techniques will be singled out...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of lamellar pearlitic steel used for railroad rails, tensile tests and fatigue tests are performed. Although the fatigue ratio of the lamellar pearlitic steel is {{lower than that of}} general steels, the reason for this has not been clarified. The fatigue cracks of the pearlitic steel initiate at a very early stage during the fatigue test. It is speculated that the steel should be treated as a steel with initial defects. In order to determine the initial defect size of the ultra-low cycle fatigue test, tensile tests are performed. Based on the test results, it was clarified that the crack initiation size depends on the crystal structure. In order to predict the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of the pearlitic steel, Murakami's prediction method is applied to the steel. The measured defect sizes are applied to the method, and the fatigue tests are performed. The predicted <b>fatigue</b> <b>limits</b> and the test results have good agreement. In addition, from the SEM observations, the initial crack causing the fatigue failure was found to be a pearlite block. We then concluded that the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of the pearlitic steel can be predicted by Murakami's method and the defect size is the pearlite block size. If the pearlite block sizes then become small, the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of the pearlitic steel will increase...|$|R

The {{high cycle}} fatigue {{characteristics}} of magnesium alloys under low humidity, high humidity (80 % RH) and sprayed 5 %NaCl solution environments have been introduced. <b>Fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of bulk magnesium alloy was significantly reduced even under high humidity condition, while other structural materials such as steel and aluminum alloy showed no influence of humidity on <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit.</b> The reduction of <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> under 5 % NaCl environments was much larger than that under high humidity environment. The remarkable reduction of <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> under corrosive environments was attributed {{to the formation of}} corrosion pit, which was induced by simultaneous action of mechanical loading and corrosive environment. To improve the reduced fatigue strength under corrosive environment, coating used to apply on the surface. Non-chromium chemical conversion coating showed superior effect on the improvement of fatigue strength under corrosive environment compared to anodized coating. Fatigue strengths of the coated and painted AZ 61 alloy under high humidity and 5 %NaCl environments showed almost the same fatigue strength as bulk material under low humidity...|$|R
40|$|For the {{critical}} engine parts {{such as the}} crankshaft, the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> load {{is one of the}} most important parameters involved the design and manufacture stage. In previous engineering applications, this parameter has always been obtained by experiment, which is expensive and time-consuming. This paper, based on the theory of critical distance (TCD), first analyzes the stress distribution of a crankshaft under its limit load. In this way, the length of {{the critical}} distance can be obtained. Then a certain load is applied to a new crankshaft made of the same material and the effective stress is calculated based on the critical distance above. Finally, the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> load of the new crankshaft can be obtained by comparing the effective stress and the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> of the material. Comparison between the prediction and the corresponding experimental data shows that the traditional TCD may result in bigger errors on some occasions, while the modified TCD proposed in this paper can provide a more satisfactory result in terms of the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> for a quick engineering prediction...|$|R

The data {{were compared with}} predictions from the author's previously published shakedown model which predicts fatigue-induced stiffness loss in metal matrix composites. A fifth lay-up, + or - 45 (sub 2 s), was tested to compare shakedown and <b>fatigue</b> <b>limits.</b> The particular batch of silicon-carbide fibers tested in this program had a somewhat lower modulus (340 GPa) than expected and displayed poor bonding to the aluminum matrix.
