5|$|In June 1918, Tucker {{joined the}} escorts {{working out of}} Brest, France. On 1 August, while <b>steaming</b> <b>out</b> to meet an inbound convoy, she {{received}} word that the group's escort, the , had been torpedoed and sunk by a German submarine. The American destroyer soon {{arrived on the scene}} and helped to save the survivors of the stricken French warship from the waters of the Bay of Biscay. Tuckers efforts, and those of the five other American destroyers who were also present, were rewarded by a commendation from the Préfet Maritime, on behalf of the French Ministry of Marine.|$|E
25|$|On 3 January 1944, Ranger {{became a}} {{training}} carrier out of Quonset Point, Rhode Island. This duty was interrupted on 20 April when she steamed to Staten Island, New York {{to take on}} 76 Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighters—together with Army, Navy, and French Navy personnel—for transportation to Casablanca. <b>Steaming</b> <b>out</b> on 24 April, she arrived at Casablanca on 4 May. The new aircraft were replaced with damaged U.S. Army aircraft marked for repair in the U.S., while military passengers were embarked for the return to New York City.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the federal victory at Corinth, the railroads that linked Memphis with {{the eastern part of the}} Confederacy had been cut, {{severely}} reducing the strategic importance of the city. Therefore, in early June 1862, Memphis and its nearby forts were abandoned by the rebel army. Most of the garrison were sent to join units elsewhere, including Vicksburg and only a small rear guard was left to make a token resistance. The River Defense Fleet was also to have retreated to Vicksburg, but it could not get enough coal in Memphis. Unable to flee when the federal fleet appeared on June 6, Montgomery and his captains had to decide whether to fight, or scuttle their boats. They chose to fight, <b>steaming</b> <b>out</b> in the early morning to meet the advancing flotilla and the rams trailing behind it, with Memphis citizens cheering them on.|$|E

5000|$|This {{explosion}} {{did little}} obvious damage, but {{it set up}} severe structural stresses throughout the framework of O'Brien. She was able to proceed under her own power, and on 16 September she reached Espiritu Santo, where the sailors from Curtiss made temporary repairs. O’Brien next <b>steamed</b> <b>out</b> on 21 September, bound for Noumea, New Caledonia, for further repairs by the repair ship [...] Then, she <b>steamed</b> <b>out</b> on 10 October, bound for San Francisco Bay.|$|R
500|$|Several factors {{served to}} {{restrain}} Tirpitzs {{freedom of operation}} in Norway. The most pressing were shortages of fuel and {{the withdrawal of the}} German destroyer forces to support Operation Cerberus, the movement of the battleships [...] and [...] and the heavy cruiser [...] up through the English Channel. These caused a planned attack against the outbound convoy PQ 8 at the end of January to be abandoned. A planned British air attack at the end of January by four-engined heavy bombers was disrupted by poor weather over the target, which prevented the aircraft from finding the ship. In early February, Tirpitz took part in the deceptions that distracted the British in the run-up to Operation Cerberus. These included <b>steaming</b> <b>out</b> of the fjord and the appearance of preparations for a sortie into the North Sea. Later that month, the ship was reinforced by the heavy cruisers [...] and Prinz Eugen and several destroyers. Prinz Eugen had been torpedoed by a British submarine {{at the entrance to the}} Fættenfjord, and was therefore temporarily out of action.|$|E
500|$|During the Spanish–American War in 1898, Irene steamed to Manila in the Philippines in the {{aftermath}} of the Battle of Manila Bay; she arrived in the harbor on 6 May. By 27 June, Irene had been joined by several other German warships, including , Diederichs's flagship. On the 27th, Irene was steaming into Manila Bay when she was stopped by the American revenue cutter Hugh McCulloch. On 5 July, Diederichs dispatched Irene to survey Subic Bay and to evacuate any German nationals in the area that were threatened by Filipino insurgents. While steaming off Isla Grande, Irene encountered the rebel ship Companie de Filipinas, which was threatening the Spanish garrison at Isla Grande. The rebel commander came aboard Irene to inform her captain of his activities; Obenheimer informed him that any act of war committed under the rebel flag was an act of piracy under international law. The rebels therefore agreed to return to port. Obenheimer inspected both the Spanish garrison on the island and the nearby rebel base in Olongapo. After unsuccessfully searching for German nationals in the area, Irene evacuated the noncombatants on Isla Grande on 7 July; while <b>steaming</b> <b>out</b> of Subic Bay, Irene encountered the American warships [...] and [...] without issue.|$|E
2500|$|Their {{disappearance}} led {{the police}} at Scotland Yard to perform another three searches of the house. During {{the fourth and}} final search, they found {{the remains of a}} human body, buried under the brick floor of the basement. Sir Bernard Spilsbury found traces of the calming drug scopolamine. The corpse was identified by a piece of skin from its abdomen; the head, limbs, and skeleton were never recovered. Crippen and Le Neve fled across the Atlantic on the Montrose, with le Neve disguised as a boy. Captain Henry George Kendall recognised the fugitives and, just before <b>steaming</b> <b>out</b> of range of the land-based transmitters, had telegraphist Lawrence Ernest Hughes send a wireless telegram to the British authorities: [...] "Have strong suspicions that Crippen London cellar murderer and accomplice are among saloon passengers. Mustache [...] taken off growing beard. Accomplice dressed as boy. Manner and build undoubtedly a girl." [...] Had Crippen travelled 3rd class, he would have probably escaped Kendall's notice. Dew boarded a faster White Star liner, the , arrived in Quebec, Canada ahead of Crippen, and contacted the Canadian authorities.|$|E

60|$|So, {{two weeks}} later, a United States man-of-war, <b>steaming</b> <b>out</b> of the Russian port of Vladivostok, was {{signaled}} by a Russian cruiser. A boat passed {{between the two}} ships, and a small boy dropped over the rail upon {{the deck of the}} American vessel. A week later he was put ashore at Hakodate, and after some telegraphing, his fare was paid on the railroad to Yokohama.|$|E
6000|$|A month later, in January, 1909, aged twenty-three and a half, Carl was <b>steaming</b> <b>out</b> of El Paso for California, {{with one}} {{thousand}} dollars in savings, a beautiful new Stetson hat, and an ambition {{to build up a}} motor business in San Francisco. As the desert sky swam with orange light and a white-browed woman in the seat behind him hummed Musetta's song from [...] "La Bohème" [...] he was homesick for the outlanders, whom he was deserting that he might stick for twenty years in one street and grub out a hundred thousand dollars.|$|E
60|$|For {{two weeks}} Campeador steamed round the islands, {{stopping}} at surf-hammered beaches {{to pick up}} cattle, camels, sheep and mules. Now the livestock was landed and Kit, waiting for a boat to carry him ashore, mused about his first encounter with the captain. Campeador was <b>steaming</b> <b>out</b> from Las Palmas, rolling violently as she breasted the long, foam-crested seas, and Kit staggered in the dark across the lumbered deck where the crew were throwing cargo into the hold. She had, as usual, started late, for in Spain nobody bothers about punctuality.|$|E
60|$|After a time, {{the boats}} {{came back for}} another load, and when sunset {{streaked}} {{the water with a}} lurid glow the guests took their leave and the Enchantress <b>steamed</b> <b>out</b> to sea.|$|R

60|$|It {{was obvious}} when the captain sketched a triangle, {{of which the}} gunboat {{occupied}} the apex and Mossamedes' course was the base. In order to clear the shoals she must shorten the base and, <b>steaming</b> <b>out,</b> lessen the distance between them; if she turned and steamed the other way the gunboat would come down obliquely and cut her line. The long chase is the stern chase, but Mossamedes could not make off like this because she was jambed against the coast. Two things were plain: the Frenchman commanded the faster vessel and had well chosen her position.|$|E
60|$|MRS. BATHURST The {{day that}} I chose to visit H.M.S. Peridot in Simon's Bay {{was the day}} that the Admiral had chosen to send her up the coast. She was just <b>steaming</b> <b>out</b> to sea as my train came in, and since the rest of the Fleet were either coaling or busy at the rifle-ranges a {{thousand}} feet up the hill, I found myself stranded, lunchless, on the sea-front with no hope of return to Cape Town before five P.M. At this crisis I had the luck to come across my friend Inspector Hooper, Cape Government Railways, in command of an engine and a brake-van chalked for repair.|$|E
60|$|The {{approach}} of two vessels, evidently men-of-war, and carrying the American flag, was perceived from the forts and redoubts {{at the mouth}} of the harbour, and the news quickly spread to the city and to the vessels in port. Intense excitement ensued on land and water, among the citizens of the place as well as its defenders. Every man who had a post of duty was instantly at it; and in less than half an hour the British man-of-war Scarabaeus, which had been lying at anchor a short distance outside the harbour, came <b>steaming</b> <b>out</b> to meet the enemy. There were other naval vessels in port, but they required more time to be put in readiness for action.|$|E

5000|$|Hornet <b>steamed</b> <b>out</b> of harbor on 17 August 1942 {{to guard}} the sea {{approaches}} to bitterly contested Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands. Bomb damage to Enterprise on 24 August, torpedo damage to [...] on 31 August, and the sinking of [...] on 15 September left Hornet as the only operational U.S. carrier in the South Pacific. She was responsible for providing air cover over the Solomon Islands until 24 October 1942, when she was joined by Enterprise just northwest of the New Hebrides Islands. These two carriers and their escorts then <b>steamed</b> <b>out</b> to intercept a Japanese aircraft carrier/battleship/cruiser force closing in on Guadalcanal.|$|R
6000|$|Of {{the fleet}} of {{transports}} and merchantmen which, trim {{and in good}} order, had lain in the bay the afternoon before, some half-dozen only had weathered the hurricane. The [...] "City of London" [...] alone had succeeded in <b>steaming</b> <b>out</b> to sea when the gale began. The [...] "Jason" [...] {{and a few others}} had ridden to their anchors through the night. The rest of the fleet had been destroyed, victims to the incompetence and pig-headedness of the naval officer in charge of the harbor. That there was ample room for all within it, was proved by the fact that, later on, a far larger number of ships than that which was present {{on the day of the}} gale lay comfortably within it.|$|E
60|$|The {{light was}} getting {{brighter}} and the wreck lay {{about a hundred}} yards off. The stump of her broken funnel, a bare iron mast, a smashed deckhouse, and a strip of slanted side rose from the languid swell. The rows of plates were red with rust and encrusted by shells. When the smooth undulations sank, long weed swung about in the sandy water. Lister thought {{the story of the}} wreck was, on the surface, plain. <b>Steaming</b> <b>out</b> with a heavy load, Arcturus had struck the bar. The surf had beaten in her hatches, broken some plates, and afterwards washed her back across the sand. Then, while the captain tried to reach the beach, she had sunk in deeper water. The story was plausible, but, if Cartwright had found the proper clew, it did not account for all.|$|E
6000|$|But that {{ceremony}} holds and can drag {{a man to}} his undoing just {{as thoroughly}} as the [...] "long as ye both shall live" [...] curse from the altar-rails, with the bridesmaids giggling behind, and [...] "The Voice that breathed o'er Eden" [...] lifting the roof off. In this manner was Dicky Hatt kidnapped, and he considered it vastly fine, for he had received an appointment in India which carried a magnificent salary from the Home point of view. The marriage was to be kept secret for a year. Then Mrs. Dicky Hatt was {{to come out and}} the rest of life was to be a glorious golden mist. That was how they sketched it under the Addison Road Station lamps; and, after one short month, came Gravesend and Dicky <b>steaming</b> <b>out</b> to his new life, and the girl crying in a thirty-shillings a week bed-and-living room, in a back street off Montpelier Square near the Knightsbridge Barracks.|$|E
