40|$|In {{the past}} 15 years, the Government of Indonesia has {{implemented}} {{a variety of}} <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> intended {{to improve the lives}} of the poor and help them escape poverty. Many of these programmes are now operating at a national scale and cover millions of Indonesians. Using a new household survey dataset that covers the eastern areas of Indonesia (Indonesian Family Life Survey East 2012), this paper investigates the household-level determinants of access to <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes.</b> The analysis reveals that <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> are relatively more available in poorer provinces and that poorer households—all things being equal—are more likely to access <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> than nonpoor households, which suggests that <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> in eastern Indonesia are successful in their efforts to target the poor (poverty targeting), both across regions and households. However, poverty targeting still has scope for improvement in terms of accuracy. Besides the poverty status (as measured in per capita consumption expenditures), the authors found that several other factors infl uence programme access. Having a disabled household member or having a household head who is a widow(er) appears to increase the likelihood of receiving <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes.</b> Likewise, the level of trust and confl ict in a community affects access to <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes.</b> Particularly in the case of Raskin, we found that the programme is distributed more widely among those communities that are characterized by higher levels of confl ict and lower levels of trust. The authors did not fi nd that poor access to infrastructure and remoteness infl uences household access to <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> once they controlled for province fi xed effects in the regression framework. Furthermore, the fi ndings suggest that possession of a local ‘poverty letter’ strongly improves household access to <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes,</b> even after controlling for a wide set of socioeconomic characteristics. In general, determinants of programme access differ signifi cantly among provinces and between rural and urban areas...|$|R
40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> {{have been}} noted {{as one of the}} {{important}} keys to determining the success of the recovery process in the aftermath a disaster. It has also been shown that <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> following a disaster, significantly contribute to the recovery phase of disaster management, by utilizing the communities? capacity to facilitate community recovery from a disaster. Through the community recovery framework, <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes,</b> with active collaboration and interaction between the community and the social assistants, can speed up community recovery efforts; contributing to the disaster recovery management. The Law of the Republic of Indonesia Number 11 of 2009 and Regulation of the Ministry of Social of the Republic of Indonesia Number 82 of 2006 set out and guide the <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> delivery to the community. However, most of the literature addressing <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes,</b> following a disaster in Indonesia, is from the government?s perspective, the legislation outlook and the social assistants? point of view. Little is known about the benefit and practice of the <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> from the perspectives of the affected community. Therefore, the current study sought to address this gap by exploring the experiences of <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> within the affected community following a disaster. With this knowledge, the government, NGOs, private sectors and other parties would gain insights, inputs and recommendations from the affected community, to whom the programmes were delivered, so that <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> following a disaster may be made more effective. A qualitative study was conducted in Kinahrejo hamlet, the most affected community from the 2010 Mount Merapi eruption. Data was analysed using qualitative descriptive methodology via open-ended and close-ended questions with 10 participants. The study explored whether the lived experiences of the Kinahrejo community was congruent with Indonesian regulation regarding <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes.</b> This study has contributed to the field of research on <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> following a disaster by providing findings on the importance of the mentioned programmes toward the affected community from the community?s experiences and perspectives...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we use city-level {{datasets}} of <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> over 280 cities between year 2003 and 2011 {{to verify}} {{the existence of the}} crowding out between <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> and unemployment insurance in China. In other words, the expansion of <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> is associated with a reduction in the enrolment of unemployment insurance. With verifying the existence of the crowding out, this article argues that the crowding out is a result of an ineffective coordination across government departments. In the process of ‘dual decentralization,’ in which the central government has delegated welfare provision responsibility to local governments, the misalignment of incentive and institutions between central and local governments explains the ineffective coordination. Different from many studies in the literature, this paper presents an adverse consequence of China 2 ̆ 7 s bureaucratic incentive system in social policy implementation. Also, while the conceptual framework ‘fragmented authoritarianism’ has highlighted the policy ineffectiveness in the economic policy area, this paper contributes to this literature by illustrating the policy ineffectiveness in the social policy areas...|$|R

40|$|The {{existing}} {{studies of}} unemployment benefit and unemployment duration suggest that reforms that lower either the level or {{the duration of}} benefits should reduce unemployment.

This paper also provides an explanation for this fact by exploring the interactions between unemployment benefits and <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes.</b> Unemployed workers who are also eligible, or expect to become eligible, for some <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> are less concerned about their benefits being reduced or terminated.

40|$|This chapter {{presents}} micro-simulation {{results of}} the impact of a new social welfare law adopted in Serbia in 2010 on income distribution and poverty outcomes across households. Micro-simulations were conducted using a tax-benefit micro-simulation model for Serbia (SRMOD). The new law introduced a number of the changes to the eligibility criteria for the last-resort <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>programme</b> discussed in this chapter. These are expected to improve significantly the targeting of social assistance, both in terms of its expanded coverage and increases in the amounts of social assistance received by the already eligible households. Simulation results suggest that the changes in legislation would increase social assistance eligibility of households in the poorest income decile by 18. 4 %. The average amount of the benefit would increase by about 10. 6 % per adult equivalent. Finally, total fiscal expenditures on MOP would increase by 34. 6 %...|$|E
40|$|We present first {{estimates}} of rates of non-take-up for social assistance in Germany after {{the implementation of}} major social policy reforms in 2005. The analysis {{is based on a}} microsimulation model, which includes {{a detailed description of the}} German <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>programme.</b> Our findings suggest a moderate decrease in non-take-up compared to estimates before the reform. In order to identify the determinants of claiming social assistance, we estimate a model of take-up behaviour which considers potential endogeneity of the benefit level. The estimations reveal that the degree of needs, measured as the social assistance benefit level a household is eligible for, and the expected duration of eligibility are the key determinants of the take-up decision, while costs of claiming seem to play a minor role.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{measuring}} {{the extent to}} which publicly subsidized transfers in Latin America and the Caribbean redistribute income. The redistributive power of 56 transfers in eight countries is measured by their simulated impacts on poverty and inequality, and by their distributional characteristic. Our findings suggest that public transfers can be effective instruments to redistribute income to the poor. Yet frequently they have not managed to do so. The redistributive impacts from social insurance are limited - and even regressive in some countries. This is due to two design factors: a truncation in coverage due to requirements of membership in formal labour markets which exclude the majority of the poor, and highly generous unit benefits for those in the upper quintiles. The more recent emergence of <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> only partially offsets this historical truncation of public transfers in the region. Despite coverage and distributional patterns that favour the poor, small unit subsidies limit the redistributive, poverty and inequality impacts of even the most targeted <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes.</b> We also find considerable variation among <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes,</b> with many food based programmes and scholarships being regressive...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} a political-sociological {{analysis of the}} World Bank’s <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> in developing and transition countries. It builds on the argument that political objectives have {{played a critical role}} for the Bank in shaping these policies, including the prevention and containment of social unrest as well as mobilization of popular support. The paper presents empirical evidence based on an analysis of 447 World Bank policy recommendation documents published between 1980 and 2013. It was found that, despite the Bank’s denial of having any political agenda, many WB documents explicitly refer to <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> as a possible instrument for governments to contain social unrest and mobilize political support. Moreover, the World Bank’s political concerns have increased steadily over the last three decades. The findings support the argument that international institutions such as the WB do not solely consider the well-being of people {{as an end in itself}} but also as a means of achieving further political goals. This political dimension of <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> has consequences for the way policy recommendations should be interpreted by political and social actors in developing and transition countries...|$|R
40|$|The South African Child Support Grant (CSG) is {{an example}} of a <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>programme</b> that, despite chronic anxieties about affordability, {{expanded}} rapidly through parametric reforms, primarily of the age limit. The initial concern about affordability was rooted in a severe fiscal crisis facing the South African state in the mid- 1990 s. This resulted in widespread (but not total) political agreement that the initial programme should be modest. The subsequent improvement in public finances meant that affordability concerns became less binding, and affordability was redefined. Political pressures to address the enduring problem of poverty, and to be seen to do so, resulted in the steady expansion of the programme. Governments make choices about programmes such as the CSG, and these choices are ultimately political. But sometimes fiscal conditions frame the choices in ways that are very likely to result in political near-consensus against programmatic expansion. The ‘affordability’ of social assistance programmes entails a mix of fiscal concerns with political factors...|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{findings from}} research in Ribáuè district, Nampula province, in northeast Mozambique. Our {{aim was to}} understand the living conditions of the impoverished elderly and identify strategies that may improve their situation. We conducted semi-structured interviews with elderly people, including some of the most vulnerable and some who receive income from the <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>programme.</b> To gain a wider context we met representatives of governmental and non-governmental organisations and referred to secondary sources. We use the Sustainable Rural Livelihoods framework to present the capital assets (natural,social, financial, physical and human) of Ribáuè district and of its elderly inhabitants. We consider how access to assets is affected by political, economic and cultural factors in the community. We set the situation of the elderly against the development history of postindependence Mozambique, and international concern about poverty, the ageing population and their human rights. We find that social assets in the form of human relationships, and natural assets in the form of land, are essential for elderly people’s livelihoods. Most of the elderly have very limited access to financial assets, apart from the few who receive social ssistance. This programme makes a very small but appreciated contribution to family welfare. However the programme’s reach has been limited geographically and eligibility regulations tend to obstruct access for the very poorest. In general the human capital of the rural and uneducated elderly is declining, as society increasingly values modern skills and knowledge. However the Ribáuè residents we met experience some benefit from infrastructure modernisation. Elderly people are receiving more attention, especially as carers of children. We have identified existing strategies for improving elderly people’s livelihoods. We suggest ways to build on these, as well as possible new strategies. If development policies are both equitable and successful, increased employment and taxation should enable formal pension and social security systems to provide for the elderly in the long-term future. In the short to medium term, expansion of the <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>programme</b> must be prioritised, as it is vital to the most vulnerable. It is also important that people’s customary engagement in mutually supportive social networks is strengthened rather than undermined by development changes.

40|$|Very preliminary. Do not quote. The {{literature}} that explores {{the effects of}} unemployment benefit systems on re-employment probabilities is a rather large one. The main results of this strand of literature predict that reforms that lower either the level or the duration of benefits should reduce unemployment by increasing individual exit rates. However, data for Europe do not show any strong nor generalised positive effect of such reforms on unemployment. This paper provides an explanation for these failures by exploring the interactions between unemployment benefit and <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes.</b> The main argument {{is based on the}} idea that unemployed workers who are also eligible or expect to become eligible for some <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> are less concerned about their benefits being reduced or exhausted.
