5|$|Brachiopods, as with molluscs, have an {{epithelial}} mantle that secretes {{and lines}} the shell, and encloses the internal organs. The brachiopod body occupies only {{about one-third of}} the internal space inside the shell, nearest the hinge. The rest of the space is lined with the mantle lobes, extensions that enclose a water-filled <b>space</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> sits the lophophore. The coelom extends into each lobe as a network of canals, which carry nutrients to the edges of the mantle.|$|E
5|$|Heathen groups {{assemble}} for rituals {{in order}} to mark rites of passage, seasonal observances, oath takings, rites devoted to a specific deity, and for rites of need. These rites also serve as identity practices which mark the adherents out as Heathens. Strmiska noted that in Iceland, Ásatrú rituals had been deliberately constructed {{in an attempt to}} recreate or pay tribute to the ritual practices of pre-Christian Icelanders, although there was also <b>space</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> these rituals could reflect innovation, changing {{in order to}} suit the tastes and needs of contemporary practitioners.|$|E
5|$|In the B-model of topological string theory, the D-branes {{are complex}} submanifolds of a Calabi–Yau {{together}} with additional data that arise physically from having charges at the endpoints of strings. Intuitively, one {{can think of}} a submanifold as a surface embedded inside the Calabi–Yau, although submanifolds can also exist in dimensions different from two. In mathematical language, the category having these branes as its objects is known as the derived category of coherent sheaves on the Calabi–Yau. In the A-model, the D-branes can again be viewed as submanifolds of a Calabi–Yau manifold. Roughly speaking, they are what mathematicians call special Lagrangian submanifolds. This means among other things that they have half the dimension of the <b>space</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> they sit, and they are length-, area-, or volume-minimizing. The category having these branes as its objects is called the Fukaya category.|$|E

5|$|Initially, Williamson {{offered his}} {{apartment}} in Kingston as a <b>space</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> gay Jamaicans could meet roughly every fortnight. In the early 1990s he purchased a large property on New Kingston's gentrified Haughton Street, converting part of this building into a gay nightclub that he called Entourage. Many of those who attended the club worked in the city's foreign embassies. Although the police tried to close it down, the club remained open for two years until Williamson was attacked by a patron carrying a knife, which was used to slash Williamson's arm. Although same-sex sexual relations between men were illegal in Jamaica, Williamson was openly gay.|$|E
5|$|Many {{types of}} objects in {{abstract}} algebra can satisfy chain conditions, and usually if they satisfy an ascending chain condition, they are called Noetherian in her honor. By definition, a Noetherian ring satisfies an ascending chain condition on its left and right ideals, whereas a Noetherian group {{is defined as a}} group in which every strictly ascending chain of subgroups is finite. A Noetherian module is a module in which every strictly ascending chain of submodules becomes constant after a finite number of steps. A Noetherian space is a topological <b>space</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> every strictly ascending chain of open subspaces becomes constant after a finite number of steps; this definition makes the spectrum of a Noetherian ring a Noetherian topological space.|$|E
5|$|Einstein's {{theory has}} {{important}} astrophysical implications. For example, it implies {{the existence of}} black holes—regions of <b>space</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> space and time are distorted {{in such a way}} that nothing, not even light, can escape—as an end-state for massive stars. There is ample evidence that the intense radiation emitted by certain kinds of astronomical objects is due to black holes; for example, microquasars and active galactic nuclei result from the presence of stellar black holes and supermassive black holes, respectively. The bending of light by gravity can lead to the phenomenon of gravitational lensing, in which multiple images of the same distant astronomical object are visible in the sky. General relativity also predicts the existence of gravitational waves, which have since been observed directly by physics collaboration LIGO. In addition, general relativity is the basis of current cosmological models of a consistently expanding universe.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the international organization, the Temple sponsors initiatory Orders and Elements and local groups called Pylons. Pylons are intended to facilitate the initiatory work of the Temple's members by conducting meetings where discussions and magical works take place. The purpose of a pylon {{is to provide a}} <b>space</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the Setian can focus on their religion, aided by like-minded individuals. Pylons typically meet in a member's home. Members usually join the Pylon located geographically closest to them. Correspondence- or Internet-based Pylons also exist, with Harvey noting that this online networking is more common than in-person interaction. A Pylon is led a by a second-degree (or higher) member who is called a Sentinel. The term pylon derives from the architectural features which served as fortified gateways to ancient Egyptian temples. One Finnish Setian informed Granholm that the relationship between the orders and the temple was like that of different departments in a university.|$|E
5|$|Named to the {{advisory}} group chosen {{to support the}} review board, Shea threw himself into the investigation, working eighty-hour weeks. Although the precise source of ignition was never found, {{it soon became clear}} that an electrical short somewhere in the command module had started the fire, probably sparked by a chafed wire. What was less clear was where to apportion responsibility. NASA engineers tended to point to what they saw as shoddy workmanship by North American Aviation. By contrast, North American executives blamed NASA management for its decision over their objections to pressurize the command module with pure oxygen to a pressure far in excess of that needed in <b>space,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> almost any materialincluding Velcro, with which the cabin was filledwould instantly burst into flames if exposed to a spark. Whatever the precise distribution of responsibility, Shea remained haunted by the feeling that he, personally, was responsible for the deaths of three astronauts. For years after the fire, he displayed the portrait given to him by the Apollo 1 crew in the front hallway of his own home.|$|E
