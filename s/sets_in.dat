50|$|For any graph G, {{its line}} graph L(G) is claw-free, and hence a minimum maximal {{independent}} <b>set</b> <b>in</b> L(G) {{is also a}} minimum dominating <b>set</b> <b>in</b> L(G). An independent <b>set</b> <b>in</b> L(G) corresponds to a matching in G, and a dominating <b>set</b> <b>in</b> L(G) corresponds to an edge dominating <b>set</b> <b>in</b> G. Therefore a minimum maximal matching has {{the same size as}} a minimum edge dominating set.|$|R

5|$|A Penrose tiling is {{an example}} of non-periodic tiling {{generated}} by an aperiodic set of prototiles. Penrose tilings are named after mathematician and physicist Sir Roger Penrose, who investigated these <b>sets</b> <b>in</b> the 1970s. The aperiodicity of prototiles implies that a shifted copy of a tiling will never match the original. A Penrose tiling may be constructed so as to exhibit both reflection symmetry and fivefold rotational symmetry, as in the diagram at the right.|$|E
