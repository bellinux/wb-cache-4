5000|$|It is {{a version}} using LPG and petrol fuel types. It {{includes}} Euro 5-compliant 1.4-litre turbo engine rated [...] at 5000 rpm and 206 Nm at 1750 rpm, three different trim levels (Giulietta, Progression and Distinctive) for all European markets, 38-litre toroid type (ring-shaped) LPG tank at <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>housing,</b> 6-speed manual transmission.|$|E
50|$|Three {{peculiarities of}} the Sport body were the engine bonnet hinged {{to the right}} hand side, the rear hatch, which could be lifted {{electrically}} by an handful of centimetres to aid cabin ventilation, and the <b>spare</b> <b>wheel,</b> <b>housed</b> in a separate compartment, accessed from a rotating panel which held the rear number plate.The tail lights were sourced from the NSU Prinz 4.|$|R
50|$|The Noble has a seating {{capacity}} of four passengers. The rear seats provide {{enough room for}} two adults with plenty of space for their knees, although the low roof-line restricts headroom significantly. The rear seats can fold down to reveal a flat loading space, which otherwise is negligible. A full size <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> is <b>housed</b> under the rear seats.|$|R
50|$|In April 1975 a 3-door {{estate car}} version {{was added to}} the range. Allegros were now coming off the {{production}} line with the same conventional steering wheel as the Morris Marina, although the company waited till early June 1975 to announce, rather quietly, the demise of the Allegro's quartic steering wheel, presumably to give time for older cars to emerge from the sales and distribution network. Similar to the 2-door saloon, the Allegro estate had a coachline and also featured a rear wash-wipe. The <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> was <b>housed</b> under the rear load floor area. It was only in production for about 100 days before the arrival of the Series 2 model, making Series I Allegro estate rarer than most other models in the range.|$|R
5000|$|As mentioned, the 600 Multipla {{used the}} type 100.000 663 cc {{overhead}} valve inline-four cylinder engine from the 600 saloon, producing [...] or 24.5 CUNA-rated PS at 4,600 rpm. A shorter {{final drive ratio}} was the only change made to the 4-speed manual transmission, with synchromesh on the top three forward gears. Rear trailing arm suspension also came from the 600, while the front double wishbone suspension—complete with coil springs, coaxial hydraulic dampers and anti-roll bar—as well as steering components were sourced from the bigger 1100/103. The larger-capacity radiator was front-mounted instead than rear-mounted as on the 600, whereas the fuel tank had been moved to the rear above the gearbox, and the <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> was <b>housed</b> inside, {{in front of the}} passenger seat. The manufacturer advertised a top speed of 90 km/h.|$|R
5000|$|As {{in every}} Bristol saloon since the 404, a {{compartment}} accessed via a hinged panel between {{the front of}} the driver's door and the rear of the front <b>wheel</b> arch <b>housed</b> the battery, fuse panel, windscreen wiper motor and brake servos. [...] A similar panel {{on the other side of}} the car <b>housed</b> the <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> and jack.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> cover or <b>spare</b> tire {{cover is}} an {{accessory}} {{that covers the}} <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> mounted on external part of a car or van. On 4x4 vehicles the <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> is normally rear mounted and is often printed with a dealer's name or something more fun. Covers can be hard shells or soft vinyl covers. <b>Spare</b> <b>wheel</b> cover protects <b>spare</b> tires from the dirt and the sun's harmful UV rays in areas with many days of sunshine. <b>Spare</b> <b>wheel</b> covers need to be removed {{once in a while}} and cleaned.|$|R
50|$|The Discovery Sport will {{initially}} be sold with alloy wheels {{ranging from}} 18 in to 20 in in diameter. Various emergency <b>spare</b> <b>wheels</b> options are available depending on vehicle configuration: a full-size <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> mounted internally under {{the floor of}} the trunk, or if the 5+2 seating option is fitted it will be a 'space-saver' <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> mounted {{on the underside of the}} car, directly under the boot. It is not possible to have a factory-fitted tow bar with a <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> on 5+2 seat vehicles as they mount in the same place under the vehicle, so a tyre repair system of sealant and a compressor is supplied instead.|$|R
50|$|Depending on the market, {{the fourth}} {{generation}} is available with an under-floor mounted or rear door mounted <b>spare</b> <b>wheel.</b> For example, UK vehicles have the <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> mounted under the floor, while in Australia and Argentina the <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> {{is mounted on}} the rear door, leaving space for an auxiliary fuel tank, which is desirable in countries where long journeys in isolated areas may be required. The fuel capacity of the dual tank series four is 150 L compared to 179 L of the series three.|$|R

50|$|The WC59 Truck, Telephone Maintenance, 3/4 ton, 4x4 Dodge (G502) was {{designed}} to install and repair telephone lines. Based on the same chassis as the WC54, but with a wheelbase increased by 50 cm. The <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> was carried behind the seats, with a step ladder fitted to where the <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> would have been. 549 were built. The bed was known by the Signal Corps as the K-50 truck, and was fitted to both Dodge and Chevrolet chassis.|$|R

50|$|There {{were two}} {{versions}} of this ambulance: The early version had two round spinning ventilators {{on the roof and}} a <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> cover with a large hump. The late version had two square fixed vents on the roof and a spare-wheel cover with a much smaller and rounder hump (as the <b>spare</b> <b>wheel</b> was moved further into the body to stop drivers hitting the cover (and wheel) when passing other vehicles; hence the cut-out in the internal door was made larger).|$|R
