25|$|During {{the first}} half of the Victorian era, there was a more or less {{negative}} view of women's styles of the 1795–1820 period. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> have felt slightly uncomfortable to be reminded that their mothers or grandmothers had once promenaded about in such styles (which could be considered indecent according to Victorian norms), and many would have found it somewhat difficult to really empathize with (or take seriously) the struggles of a heroine of art or literature if they were being constantly reminded that she was wearing such clothes. For such reasons, some Victorian history paintings of the Napoleonic wars intentionally avoided depicting accurate women's styles (see example below), Thackeray's illustrations to his book Vanity Fair depicted the women of the 1810s wearing 1840s fashions, and in Charlotte Brontë's 1849 novel Shirley (set in 1811–1812) neo-Grecian fashions are anachronistically relocated to an earlier generation.|$|E
25|$|After {{the first}} double murder, some parents warned their {{children}} about being out late. The second double murder shocked {{the city and}} curfews were set for businesses. The height of the town's hysteria snowballed after the murder of Virgil Starks. The Texarkana Gazette stated on Sunday, May 5, that the killer might strike again at any moment, at any place and at any one. Before, it was normal to leave your house unlocked, but soon residents started locking doors, pulling down shades, blocking windows, and arming themselves with guns. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> nail sheets over their windows or nail the window down. Some used screened-door braces as window guards. The next day after Starks' death, several residents bought firearms and locks. Stores sold out of locks, guns, ammunition, and window shades and Venetian blinds. Other items that sold well included window sash locks, screen door hooks, night latches, and other protective devices.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1315, unusually heavy rain began in much of Europe. Throughout the spring and the summer, it {{continued}} to rain, and the temperature remained cool. Under such conditions, grain could not ripen, leading to widespread crop failures. Grain was brought indoors in urns and pots to keep dry. The straw and hay for the animals could not be cured, {{so there was no}} fodder for the livestock. The price of food began to rise; prices in England doubled between spring and midsummer. Salt, the only way to cure and preserve meat, was difficult to obtain because brine could not be effectively evaporated in wet weather; its price increased from 30 shillings to 40 shillings. In Lorraine, wheat prices grew by 320% making bread unaffordable to peasants. Stores of grain for long-term emergencies were limited to royalty, lords, nobles, wealthy merchants and the Church. Because of the general increased population pressures, even lower-than-average harvests meant <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> go hungry; there was little margin for failure. People began to harvest wild edible roots, plants, grasses, nuts and bark in the forests.|$|E

25|$|By 1987, nine {{channels}} were scrambled, but 99 {{others were}} available free-to-air. While HBO initially charged a monthly fee of $19.95, soon it became possible to unscramble all channels for $200 a year. Dish sales went down from 600,000 in 1985 to 350,000 in 1986, but pay television services were seeing dishes as something positive since <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> never have cable service, {{and the industry}} was starting to recover as a result. Scrambling also {{led to the development}} of pay-per-view events. On November 1, 1988, NBC began scrambling its C-band signal but left its Ku band signal unencrypted in order for affiliates to not lose viewers who could not see their advertising. Most of the two million satellite dish users in the United States still used C-band. ABC and CBS were considering scrambling, though CBS was reluctant due to the number of people unable to receive local network affiliates. The piracy on satellite television networks in the US led to the introduction of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992. This legislation enabled anyone caught engaging in signal theft to be fined up to $50,000 and to be sentenced to a maximum of two years in prison. A repeat offender can be fined up to $100,000 and be imprisoned for up to five years.|$|E

[...] Despite positive feelings about the movies, he has no interest in doing more Harry Potter films. After Rowling hinted about writing an eighth book, Radcliffe was asked if he would do another film to which he replied: [...] " [...] very doubtful. I think 10 {{years is a long time}} to spend with one character." [...] Despite devoting so much time to the series, Radcliffe has asserted that he did not miss out on a childhood like other child actors: [...] "I’ve been given a much better perspective on life by doing Potter." ...|$|E
500|$|A related problem {{arising from}} the tablets' browser access was {{that even though the}} tablets were {{intended}} for people to use it {{for a short period of}} time, the Links began being [...] "monopolized" [...] almost as soon as they were unveiled. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> use the Links for hours at a time. Particularly, homeless New Yorkers would sometimes loiter around the Links, using newspaper dispensers and milk crates as [...] "makeshift furniture" [...] on which they could sit while using the Links. The New York Post characterized the Links as having become [...] "living rooms for vagrants." [...] As a result, LinkNYC staff were working on a way to help ensure that Links would not be monopolized by one or two people. Proposals for solutions included putting time limits on how long the tablets could be used by any one person.|$|E

NBA commissioner David Stern also believed Lin was not drafted due to discrimination. [...] "I don't know whether he was discriminated against because he was at Harvard. Or because he was Asian," [...] said Stern. Some fans and commentators wrote off his Warriors signing as a publicity stunt. Larry Riley, the team's general manager, denied catering to the Bay Area's large Asian population. He understood that <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> see it that way. [...] "We evaluated him throughout summer league," [...] Riley said. [...] "All that had to happen was for him to confirm what we already believed." [...] While the team created a campaign around him, Riley said {{it would not have been}} advisable if Lin was not a basketball player first.|$|E
500|$|The general {{population}} was less sympathetic towards Noreen. Several signs were erected in Sheikhupura and other rural areas declaring {{support for the}} blasphemy laws, including one that called for Noreen to be beheaded. Mohammad Saleem, {{a member of the}} Jamiat Ulema-e-Pakistan Party, organized a demonstration in Rawalpindi and led a small crowd chanting, [...] "Hang her, hang her." [...] In December 2010, a month after Noreen's conviction, a Muslim cleric announced a 500,000 Pakistani rupee award (the equivalent of $10,000) to anyone who would kill her. One survey reported that around 10 million Pakistanis had said that {{they would be willing to}} personally kill her out of either religious conviction or for the reward. The village mosque in Ittan Wali was reportedly indifferent towards Noreen's plight; its imam, Qari Mohammed Salim, stated that he had wept for joy on learning that she had been sentenced to death and threatened that <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> [...] "take the law into their own hands" [...] should she be pardoned or released. However, journalist Julie McCarthy suggested that the country's [...] "more peaceful majority views" [...] had been overshadowed by the more vocal fundamentalists.|$|E
500|$|Pokémon Black and White have {{received}} largely positive reviews by critics, having an aggregate score of 87% on Metacritic, indicating generally favorable reviews. Japanese magazine Famitsu Weekly awarded the game a perfect 40/40 score, becoming the 15th game to receive such a distinction, {{as well as}} obtaining the highest score ever given to a Pokémon video game by the publication. Game Informers Annette Gonzalez remarked that [...] "Pokémon Black and White {{do a great job}} building upon already solid features and taking them to the next level." [...] VideoGamer.com's Jamin Smith criticized the games for not innovating as much as <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> have liked, but stated that [...] "rest assured in the knowledge that Black and White are damn fine games; the best the series has to offer." [...] Official Nintendo Magazine referred to them as [...] "A beautiful refinement of a great series [...] the best Pokémon ever."

500|$|In 1903, the Georgist Lizzie Magie {{applied for}} a patent on a game called The Landlord's Game with the object of showing that rents enriched {{property}} owners and impoverished tenants. She knew that <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> {{find it hard to}} understand the logic behind the idea, and she thought that if the rent problem and the Georgist solution to it were put into the concrete form of a game, it might be easier to demonstrate. She was granted the patent for the game in January 1904. The Landlord's Game {{became one of the first}} board games to use a [...] "continuous path", without clearly defined start and end spaces on its board. Another innovation in gameplay attributed to Magie is the concept of [...] "ownership" [...] of a place on a game board, such that something would happen to the second (or later) player to land on the same space, without the first player's piece still being present. A copy of Magie's game that she had left at the Georgist community of Arden, Delaware and dating from 1903–1904, was presented for the PBS series History Detectives. This copy featured property groups, organized by letters, later a major feature of Monopoly as published by Parker Brothers.|$|E
500|$|Burton {{revealed}} that Dylan is [...] "a lot more" [...] like himself. [...] "Jason was so stoic and didn't {{really get to}} show a lot of personality, unless it was with Spinelli or Sam," [...] he said. Dylan {{has a sense of}} humor, and the actor felt that it would bring out a [...] "lighter side" [...] of his acting. In addition to his [...] "entire makeover" [...] which included a new hairstyle, Burton lost weight to play Dylan, as the costume department wanted him to look younger. Burton admitted during an interview with Entertainment Weekly that he was worried about how Dylan would be received, considering the [...] "persona" [...] of Jason is out there; he hoped [...] "people will buy" [...] Dylan, although <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> say [...] "You are Jason and that's it." [...] Burton told Yahoo! that: [...] " [...] extremely different. That's the biggest thing for me, that after playing a character, which I loved, for 21 years, coming here and trying to do something different - 'cause I know fans are always gonna see me as that character if they watch the show and if they watch both shows... So, it's definitely a challenge because I was so used to playing that character." [...] Jason's [...] "confined" [...] ways allowed Dylan to have a [...] "little more" [...] of Burton's own personality.|$|E
500|$|When Chapter 27 premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, {{the film}} was debated {{fiercely}} by critics. A website reported, [...] "the audience's reactions made it obvious that <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> love it and others would not." [...] Andrew O'Hehir from Salon wrote, [...] "Some viewers may well find Chapter 27 sleazy or distasteful, and I won't argue the point. But Schaefer's movie creates its own highly compelling world, which {{is pretty much the}} prime directive in filmmaking." [...] He stated that [...] "Leto almost makes you feel how it happened," [...] and called his acting a [...] "highly compelling performance on many levels." [...] He also enjoyed Lohan's performance. Duane Byrge of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "Chapter 27 is a smart attempt to distill the twisted psychology and motivation of Mark David Chapman, which we've all superficially gleaned through mass-media reports and intermittent updates on Chapman's incarceration." [...] He praised Leto's acting saying, [...] "Jared Leto is mesmeric as the bloated, deranged Chapman. It's a brilliantly measured performance, evincing the tale of a madman through his own awful rhyme and reason." [...] He also praised Schaefer's direction, the other cast and crew. Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three out of four stars saying, [...] "By the end of this modest, strange venture, Leto made me believe it was worth being forced to hang out on the sidewalk with this man, if only to get a creeping sense of what that might've been like." ...|$|E
50|$|Additionally, {{several people}} {{involved}} with the film industry were recruited from Hollywood, given that {{they were among the}} few who were familiar with electrical recording and projecting of sound; <b>some</b> of these <b>people</b> <b>would</b> be involved in the development of sonar.|$|R
50|$|Much like Captain Underpants, Super Diaper Baby {{was also}} banned in several schools for being {{inappropriate}} for children. It also faced criticism, {{along with the}} rest of the graphic novels, as <b>some</b> <b>people</b> claimed it <b>would</b> make children bad at spelling.|$|R

50|$|Another {{supposed}} {{method of}} protection from kallikantzaroi {{was to leave}} the fire burning in the fireplace, all night, {{so that they could}} not enter through it. In <b>some</b> areas, <b>people</b> <b>would</b> burn the Yule log {{for the duration of the}} twelve days. In other areas, <b>people</b> <b>would</b> throw foul-smelling shoes into the fire, as the stench was believed to repel the kallikantzaroi and thus force them to stay away.

2500|$|There {{were two}} more slangs that {{reflected}} flapper’s behaviors or lifestyles, which were [...] "treating" [...] and [...] "charity girls". [...] "Treating" [...] was a culture or habit mainly for the working-class flappers. Although they earned money from work, they {{still wanted to}} earn some more for them to live. Women were willingly invited to dance, for drinks, for entrances up to jewelry and clothing. For the [...] "return service", women granted any kind of erotic or sexual interaction from flirting to sexual intercourse. However, this practice was easily mistaken for prostitution. So, <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> call them [...] "charity girls" [...] to differentiate them from prostitutes as the girls claimed {{that they did not}} accept money in their sexual encounters with men.|$|E
2500|$|What Is Your Dangerous Idea?: Today's Leading Thinkers on the Unthinkable {{is a book}} {{edited by}} John Brockman, which deals with [...] "dangerous" [...] ideas, or ideas that <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> react to in ways that suggest a {{disruption}} of morality and ethics. Scientists, philosophers, artists, and various other groups of people have written in to the online salon called the Edge, where thinkers in several areas post and discuss their ideas. [...] This collection of responses forms {{the entirety of the}} book (possibly with some excluded because of the great number of posts).

After reading the script, Moss stated that at first, she did not believe {{she had to do}} the extreme acrobatic actions as {{described}} in the script. She also doubted how the Wachowskis would get to direct a movie with a budget so large, but after spending an hour with them going through the storyboard, she understood why <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> trust them.
