50|$|Four {{essential}} {{components are}} included in the hardware design: host interface, SRAM (cache), NAND flash memory, and control logic. In order to fill up the performance gap between NAND and NOR, SRAM serves as a cache layer for data access over NAND. The host interface is responsible to the communication with the host system via address and data buses. Most importantly, the control logic manages the caching activity and provides the <b>service</b> <b>emulation</b> of NOR flash with NAND flash and SRAM; it must have an intelligent prediction mechanism implemented to improve the system performance. There are two major components in the control logic: The converter emulates NOR flash access over NAND flash with an SRAM cache, where address translation must be done from byte addressing (for NOR) to Logical Block Address (LBA) addressing (for NAND). Note that each 512B/2KB NAND page corresponds to one and four LBA’s, respectively. The prefetch procedure tries to prefetch data from NAND to SRAM so that the hit rate of the NOR access is high over SRAM. The procedure should parse and extract the behavior of the target application via a set of collected traces. According to the extracted access patterns from the collected traces, the procedure generates prediction information, referred to as a prediction graph.|$|E

40|$|Emulation as a {{strategy}} for digital preservation {{is about to become}} an accepted technology for memory institutions as a method for coping a large variety of complex digital objects. Hence, the demand for ready-made and especially easy-to-use <b>emulation</b> <b>services</b> will grow. In order to provide user-friendly <b>emulation</b> <b>services</b> a scalable, distributed system model is required to be run on heterogeneous Grid or Cluster infrastructure. We propose an Emulation-as-a-Service architecture that simplifies access to preserved digital assets allowing end users to interact with the original environments running on different emulators.

40|$|Software <b>service</b> <b>emulation</b> is an {{emerging}} technique for creating realistic executable models of server-side behaviour and is particularly useful in quality assurance: replicating production-like conditions for large-scale enterprise software systems. This allows performance engineers to mimic very {{large numbers of}} servers and/or provide a means of controlling dependencies on diverse third-party systems. Previous approaches to <b>service</b> <b>emulation</b> rely on manual definition of interaction behaviour requiring significant human effort. They also rely on either a system expert or documentation of system protocol and behaviour, neither of which are necessarily available. We present a novel method of automatically building client-server and server-server interaction models of complex software systems directly from interaction trace data, utilising longest common subsequence matching and field substitution algorithms. We evaluate our method against two common application-layer protocols: LDAP and SOAP. The results show that without explicit knowledge of the protocol specifications, our generated service models can produce well-formed responses for interactions. These responses can then be used within an emulation framework for large-scale enterprise system quality assurance purposes...|$|E
40|$|Software <b>service</b> <b>emulation</b> is an {{emerging}} technique for creating realistic executable models of server-side behaviour. It is particularly useful in quality assurance and DevOps, replicating production-like conditions for large-scale enterprise software systems. Existing approaches can automatically build client-server and server-server interaction models of complex software systems directly from analysis of service interaction trace data. However, when these interaction traces become large, searching an entire trace library {{to generate a}} run-time responses can become very slow. In this paper we describe a new technique that utilises data mining, specifically clustering algorithms, to pre-process large amounts of recorded interaction trace data. With the obtained clusters we facilitate efficient yet well-formed runtime response generation in our Enterprise System emulation environment. We evaluate our approach using two common application-layer protocols: LDAP and SOAP. Our experimental results show that by utilising clustering techniques in the pre-processing step, the response generation time can be reduced by 99 % on average compared with existing approaches...|$|E
40|$|Constructing testbeds for systems {{which are}} {{interconnected}} with large networks of other software services is a challenging task. It is particularly difficult to create testbeds facilitating {{evaluation of the}} non-functional qualities of a system, such as scalability, that can be expected in production deployments. Software <b>service</b> <b>emulation</b> is an approach for creating such testbeds where service behaviour is defined by emulate-able models executed in an emulation runtime environment. We present (i) a meta-modelling framework supporting emulate-able service modelling (including messages, protocol, behaviour and states), and (ii) Kaluta, an emulation environment able to concurrently execute large numbers (thousands) of service models, providing a testbed which mimics the behaviour and characteristics of large networks of interconnected software services. Experiments show that Kaluta can emulate 10, 000 servers using a single physical machine, and is a practical testbed for scalability testing of a real, enterprise-grade identity management suite. The insights gained into the tested enterprise system were used to enhance its design.

40|$|Networks are {{increasingly}} {{subjected to a}} broad spectrum of threats that impact the reliability and availability of critical infrastructure. In response, researchers and network operators have increasingly relied on monitoring to characterize and track these threats. This paper introduces the Internet Motion Sensor (IMS), a globally scoped Internet threat monitoring system whose goal is to measure, characterize, and track threats. The dark address sensors in the IMS extend simple passive capture using a novel transport layer <b>service</b> <b>emulation</b> technique to elicit payloads across all services, thereby addressing the issue depth of service coverage. To achieve breadth of coverage, the IMS employs a distributed infrastructure and utilizes sensors that are aware of their address diversity and their position in the actively routed topology. Finally, the IMS uses an innovative signature encoding and data warehousing system combined with a hierarchical architecture to realize a system that is not only time and space efficient, but is also scalable to a global deployment. We explore the various architectural tradeoffs {{in the context of a}} 3 year deployment across multiple dark address blocks ranging in size from / 24 s to a / 8. We show how the current architecture emulates services across a diverse set of routed and address topologies in a scalable manner.

40|$|Todays most {{disruptive}} cyber threats can {{be attributed}} to botnet-connected malware. Thus, timely intelligence on emerging trends in the malicious landscape is an essential prerequisite for successful malware defense. This is commonly gained by collection and examination of current real-world attack data and a preferably meticulous analysis of the most recent malware samples. However, the ongoing sophistication of malware led to intensive obfuscation and anti-debugging measures and also resulted in a complex and multi-staged malware execution life-cycle. In this thesis we present a novel approach for integrated honeypot based malware col- lection and analysis, which extends the functionalities of existing approaches. Speciﬁcally our approach addresses the separation of coll ection and analysis, the limitations of ser- vice emulation and the operational risk of high-interaction honeypots. Our overall goal is to capture and analyze malware at a large-scale while covering the entire execution life- cycle of a given malware. This should happen in a preferably automated fashion within a controlled environment while being able to handle novel malware and the respective command-and-control (C&C) communication as well. Contrary to purely network-based approaches, we aim towards retrieving information about the malwares logics at runtime on a collection and analysis system. Thus we can provide the currently being analyzed malware with all requested resources in time, despite it is executed within an isolated environment. Our assumption is that being able to track the entire malware execution life-cycle enables a better understanding of current and emerging malware. In addition we develop a concept for providing emulated services to a malware sample under analysis thereby fulﬁlling possible liability constraints. In particular we focus on the issue of handling unknown trafﬁc patterns, such as C&C protocols, within our approach. To this end we present a proof of concept implementation leveraging ﬁnite state machines for generating <b>service</b> <b>emulation</b> scripts intended to spawn an emulated C&C service. We evaluate the feasibility of our proof of concept using C&C trafﬁc from a self-made minimal botnet...|$|E

Therefore, when CLO service and CO services have to share the same ATM link, a conflict may arise. This is because a bandwidth allocation to obtain maximum statistical gain can damage the contracted ATM quality of service (QOS); and vice versa, in order to guarantee the contracted QOS, the statistical gain have to be sacrificed.
