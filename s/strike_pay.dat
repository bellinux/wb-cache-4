25|$|In 1926, {{he found}} work again, {{this time as}} a paid union official. His wage of Â£5 a week was paid {{by the members of}} the local Miners' Lodge. His new job arrived in time for him to head the local miners against the {{colliery}} companies in what would become the General Strike. When the strike started on 3 May 1926, Bevan soon {{emerged as one of the}} leaders of the South Wales miners. The miners remained on strike for six months. Bevan was largely responsible for the distribution of <b>strike</b> <b>pay</b> in Tredegar and the formation of the Council of Action, an organisation that helped to raise money and provided food for the miners.|$|E
25|$|The break {{began in}} 1984. That year, the Canadian UAW {{leadership}} learned that Bieber had actively resisted and counteracted {{their attempts to}} avoid a concessionary contract. The Canadian UAW locals at General Motors rejected the contract negotiated by Bieber and his team, and 36,000 union members went out on strike in October. After two weeks, GM agreed to the Canadian union's demands, which included higher annual wage increases and no work teams, no profit sharing, and no joint labor-management committees. The Canadian locals learned that Bieber had threatened to withdraw authorization for their strike, which would have left them without <b>strike</b> <b>pay.</b> The Canadian strike against GM not only strained relationships between the American and Canadian wings of the UAW, but also put a heavy strain on the union's strike fund. Angry at Bieber's interference, White and the Canadian leadership offered a resolution before the UAW executive board which would have limited American interference in Canadian UAW affairs. White's proposal gave the Canadian leadership exclusive control over collective bargaining and strike authorizations, removed international UAW authority over Canadian staff, and granted the Canadians unrestricted access to the UAW strike fund. Bieber strongly opposed the plan, and the UAW executive board rejected it {{by a vote of}} 24-to-1.|$|E

500|$|There was an upturn {{in trade}} in 1892, heralding another period {{of growth in}} the industry. This growth was mainly at Blaenau Ffestiniog and in the Nantlle Valley, where the {{workforce}} at Penyrorsedd reached 450. Slate production in Wales peaked at over half a million tons in 1898, with 17,000 men employed in the industry. A second lock-out or strike at the Penrhyn Quarry began on 22 November 1900 and lasted for three years. The causes of the dispute were complex, but included the extension of a system of contracting out parts of the quarry. The quarrymen, instead of arranging their own bargains, would find themselves working for a contractor. The union's funds for <b>strike</b> <b>pay</b> were inadequate, and {{there was a great deal}} of hardship among the 2,800 workers. Lord Penrhyn reopened the quarry in June 1901, and about 500 men returned to work, to be castigated as [...] "traitors" [...] by the remainder. Eventually the workers were forced to return to work in November 1903 on terms laid down by Lord Penrhyn. Many of the men considered to have been prominent in the union were not re-employed, and many of those who had left the area to seek work elsewhere did not return. The dispute left a lasting legacy of bitterness in the Bethesda area.|$|E

50|$|<b>Strike</b> <b>pay</b> {{refers to}} {{payments}} {{made by a}} trade union to workers who are on strike as help in meeting their basic needs while on strike, often out of a special reserve known as a strike fund.
