50|$|The Montgomeryshire Wildlife Trust, {{working in}} {{partnership}} with the BBC (since featuring the Dyfi Osprey Project on Springwatch in 2011) successfully fitted all three of the osprey chicks with GPS <b>satellite</b> <b>trackers</b> as they were ringed on 19 July 2011 to feed back positional information on their 3500 mi migration to Africa. These are the first Welsh ospreys to be satellite tracked.|$|R

25|$|On 21 March 2016, after a {{lifespan}} {{extended by}} two years, the Space Engineering Office announced that Tiangong-1 had officially ended its service. They {{went on to}} state that the telemetry link with Tiangong-1 had been lost. A couple of months later, amateur <b>satellite</b> <b>trackers</b> watching Tiangong-1 found that China's space agency had {{lost control of the}} station. In September, after conceding they had lost control over the station, officials announced that the station would re-enter and burn up in the atmosphere late in 2017. It is currently expected to deorbit some time between early January and late February 2018.|$|R
50|$|On Friday 13 July, {{the chick}} - now a {{juvenile}} - was again {{removed from the}} nest, this time for ringing with a Blue darvic ring with the letters 3C, and was weighed and measured with the verdict that Ceulan was a young male. A <b>satellite</b> <b>tracker</b> was also fitted {{so that he could}} be followed as he made his first migratory journey. Just over a week later, he fledged from the nest at 53 days old, and after some flying practice over the next few weeks, he departed on 3 September. His mother, Nora had already left on migration, leaving Monty to continue to feed the youngster. Monty departed just two days after Ceulan.|$|E
50|$|In 2016, out of 214 {{vultures}} at JCBC, 76 were White-backed vulture, 29 were Slender-billed vulture, 107 were White-backed vulture and {{two were}} Himalayan vulture (thee two were released in that year). In 2016, Asia's first ever release of vultures program commenced on the World Environment Day, {{with the release of}} two Himalayan Griffons, that were released with the wing tags (brightly coloured plastic tags for the field observation through binoculars) and ring tags (pbrightly coloured lastic tags with conspicuous letters and numbers markings used by the filed biologists to identify individual birds without recapture) but without the satellite-based tracking device. These two vultures were brought in 2005 to lay eggs for breeding, were eventually released in the wild in 2016, but could not be tracked {{due to the lack of}} <b>satellite</b> <b>tracker.</b> In 2016, 15 vultures, 10 Slender-billed and 5 White-backed. were sent from JCBC to Kerwa Vulture Breeding Center located inside the Van Vihar National Park at Bhopal.|$|E
5000|$|In 1994, {{the first}} green turtle {{carrying}} a <b>satellite</b> <b>tracker</b> {{set out from}} Wang'an in Penghu, heading North crossed the Taiwan Strait, through the East China Sea Shelf, ending up in an island south of Kyūshū in Japan. The turtle spent three years and traveled 3,400 kilometers back to Penghu, providing an important record for the research of green turtles in Taiwan. Many beaches {{on the island of}} Taiwan were recorded to have sea turtles coming ashore to lay eggs, but as development changed the coastal environment, fewer places were able to support natural life. Today, {{there are only a few}} places left in the island of Taiwan, but the reserve in Wang'an Township of Penghu County is a place where green turtles visit more often and more steady to lay eggs. Shouldn't be a surprise, considering the low level of development of the area. Standing southeast of Wang'an islet, there is a building shaped like a sea turtle: it's the [...] "Green Turtle Tourism and Conservation Center”.|$|E
50|$|The {{websites}} of {{the wildlife}} organisations which protect and manage {{access to the}} nest sites at Loch Garten, Rutland Water, WWT Caerlaverock, Scottish Wildlife Trust at Loch of the Lowes and Dyfi, stream live webcam pictures of nesting birds during the breeding season (typically April-September). Loch Garten, Dyfi and the Highland Foundation for Wildlife have fitted <b>satellite</b> <b>trackers</b> to some chicks to improve understanding of migratory behaviour. The exact location of many nests is not widely disclosed due {{to the risk of}} eggs being stolen by egg collectors which, despite being made illegal in 1981 under the Wildlife and Countryside Act, continues to present a threat to rare nesting birds.|$|R
50|$|Contact {{between the}} {{organizers}} and participants is minimal {{outside of the}} checkpoints and not all checkpoints are staffed 24 hours per day. Riders' <b>satellite</b> <b>trackers</b> can also fail, which is typically due to the tracker's batteries going flat despite riders being encouraged to carry spares and to change them at certain intervals. Many forms of cheating are possible {{due to the lack}} of monitoring, including the use of performance-enhancing substances. The organizers hope that an honor system is sufficient to curb violations, and in 2015 an online form was created for people to submit reports of rule-breaking. It is impossible to know how big a problem cheating actually is, but it is hoped that it is low since winning has no monetary value.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{investigated}} the 3 -dimensional foraging behaviour of little penguins Eudyptula minor breeding on an artificially constructed breakwater near dredged shipping channels in Port Phillip Bay, southern Australia. Breeding penguins were fitted with either <b>satellite</b> <b>trackers</b> or timedepth recorders during the 2006 – 2007 breeding season to record foraging locations and diving behaviour, {{which were then}} compared with local bathymetry. Diving appeared to be both mid-water and demersal, and on 1 d trips penguins reached a mean maximum distance from the colony of 13. 8 km. Penguins were recorded in locations containing artificially constructed shipping channels, and examination of their diving profiles suggests that they probably forage within these channels. Little penguins at this urban colony have benefited from anthropogenic alterations in the terrestrial environment, but their location exposes them to many potential anthropogenic threats in their marine environment, including a large-scale dredging operation to deepen the existing shipping channels...|$|R
50|$|The trio {{then go to}} Venice (where Baba is said to be, {{based on}} Abhimanyu's {{information}}). There, Abhimanyu meets his girlfriend Sonia (Lara Dutta) and tries backing out of the mission by passing of Sonia as Baba's girlfriend who wants {{a huge amount of}} money for the information she would supposedly provide. Thus, under this pretext, he double crosses Arjun and Karan, takes the money, and tries escaping with the money along with Sonia. Before he can do so, both he and Sonia are kidnapped by Baba and his men. Priya (Amisha Patel), a press reporter from Aaj Tak, looking for a story on Karan earlier, has followed the two there, using a <b>satellite</b> <b>tracker</b> for mobile phones. She meets them and tells them about Abhimanyu's deceit. Despite this, The three go to rescue Abhimanyu and Sonia, in a lengthy gunfight and high speed car chase. Karan and Arjun are angry at Abhimanyu's betrayal, however the latter apologizes and agrees to help them in return for their saving his life since he intends to settle scores with Salim (Chunky Pandey), one of Baba's trusted aides who had been instrumental in helping Baba set him up. The five then go and apprehend Salim and after some effort, he divulges at gunpoint that Baba is in Munich. Abhimanyu then shoots him for his betrayal. Karan finds Baba in Munich and tells him about Salim's death much to Baba's devastation, reiterating his warning that he would fulfil his promise of bringing the latter back to India at any cost.|$|E

5000|$|In 2017, out of 250 vultures, 90 {{were caught}} for the {{breeding}} and 160 have been bred in the captivity {{in the natural}} setting of Bir Shikargah Wildlife Sanctuary, which {{makes it easy to}} rehabilitate the vultures in a phased manner in the wild-like natural conditions for the eventual release in wild. Since 2017, JCBC started to use the Satellite tracking system by purchasing the tracking units from British catalogue retailer Argos at the cost of INR 5 lakh each, after obtaining the allocation of radio frequency and security clearance from the Department of Telecommunications of the [...] Indian Ministry of Communications. Vultures are acclimatized with the dummy tags prior to the release. Each satellite tracking unit, tagged under the wings with the light weight sturdy teflon string, relays vulture's latitude and longitude location four times a day during the 3 years life span of the tracking unit. Up on release, if the tracking location remains static for a day, it is indicative of some problem, which is then investigated by the ground team of humans to physically locate and investigate the vulture. In 2017, eight vultures were released with the <b>satellite</b> <b>trackers</b> for the first time, out of which were White-backed vulture and two other vultures brought from the wild {{at the beginning of the}} breeding program in 2007 for the purpose of breeding.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{the paper}} {{a very simple}} {{parallel}} robot intended for some celestial orientation applications (<b>satellite</b> dishes, sun <b>trackers,</b> cameras, telescopes etc.) is proposed. After describing the mechanism and its kinematics, the workspace {{and the presence of}} the singularities are studied. The dimensional optimization to maximize the workspace is described, taking into account the constraints due to telescopic leg lengths and transmission angles...|$|R
40|$|This poster {{presents}} {{preliminary findings}} from a {{proof of concept}} trial for satellite tracking of Baudin’s cockatoos. The study follows the work by Christine Groom, which is successfully demonstrating that Carnaby’s cockatoos can be tracked using satellite transmitters, and a trial which involved attaching transmitter devices to captive black cockatoos of all three species (Le Souef et al. 2013, in press). Two rehabilitated adult female Baudin’s cockatoos were anaesthetised and fitted with tail-mounted <b>satellite</b> <b>trackers</b> and released in Kelmscott in September 2012. Prior to release, both birds were health checked and flight tested to demonstrate fitness for release. The movements of the cockatoos were monitored according to Argos satellite transmissions, as well as ground truthing using flock sightings and reception of VHF signals from the satellite units using a radio telemetry antenna. According to their transmissions, the birds initially stayed in the Kelmscott area {{in close proximity to}} one another and other groups of Baudin’s cockatoos in the area. However, after several days, one of the cockatoos flew south and joined a flock of Baudin’s cockatoos migrating further south. Interestingly, during this migration, this bird returned to the Serpentine area from which she was originally found injured. This bird currently remains in the Beela area, 140 km southeast of Perth, with other Baudin’s cockatoos. The second cockatoo remained in the release area for several weeks before also moving south to Cardup, 33 km southeast of Perth, where her transmitter was found two months later, still attached to the tail feathers which had possibly moulted out...|$|R
40|$|CMOS image sensors (or APS: {{active pixel}} sensors) {{are now the}} {{technology}} of choice for most imaging applications, such as digital video cameras. Whereas their sensitivity doesn't reach that of the best actual CCDs (whose fill factor is about 100 %), they are now commonly used because of their multiple functionalities (windowing, on-chip signal processing) and their easy serial fabrication. In this paper, we present a study of different pixel photodiodes and architectures, {{in order to increase}} their sensitivity and reduce their spatial and temporal noise. These chips will be used in <b>satellite</b> star <b>trackers,</b> and should be hardened to radiation. Two different architectures are investigated. The first one uses the photodiode capacitance for signal integration, as it is usually done in literature. This capacitance should be as low as possible, to increase conversion factor (the gain of the pixel) and reduce reset noise, and that's why different standard CMOS photodiodes have been studied and quantified...|$|R
40|$|Terrestrial Gamma-Ray Flashes (TGFs) {{are very}} short bursts of high energy photons and {{electrons}} originating in Earth's atmosphere. We present here a localization study of TGFs {{carried out at}} gamma-ray energies above 20 MeV based on an innovative event selection method. We use the AGILE <b>satellite</b> Silicon <b>Tracker</b> data {{that for the first}} time have been correlated with TGFs detected by the AGILE Mini-Calorimeter. We detect 8 TGFs with gamma-ray photons of energies above 20 MeV localized by the AGILE gamma-ray imager with an accuracy of 5 - 10 degrees at 50 MeV. Remarkably, all TGF-associated gamma rays are compatible with a terrestrial production site closer to the sub-satellite point than 400 km. Considering that our gamma rays reach the AGILE satellite at 540 km altitude with limited scattering or attenuation, our measurements provide the first precise direct localization of TGFs from space.

40|$|This article {{presents}} the dynamic analysis and simulation for a nonlinear {{model of a}} Stewart platform with asymmetric-adjustable payload, based on Lagrangian approach. Due to the asymmetry of payload, the moment of inertia matrix is not diagonal and computing their terms {{is more complicated than}} for a symmetric load. Previous research about dynamic analysis of the Stewart platform are mostly considering static and symmetric payload, while numerous applications may have asymmetric payload such as <b>satellite</b> antenna <b>trackers</b> or surgical tables and so on. This article considers an asymmetric-adjustable payload applied to a Stewart platform, deriving the dynamic equations of the model. Moreover, the moment of inertia matrix and Coriolis-centrifugal terms matrices, which are useful for control analysis of the robot, are obtained. In addition, to verify the correctness of the model, the system has been modelled in ADAMS engineering software and the inverse dynamic solution has been developed by both analytical (Lagrangian formulation) and simulation (ADAMS) methods. The results show that the analytical model is so reliable and accurate that it can be used for dynamic analysis in other similar problems. Finally, the singularities of the model are determine...|$|R
5000|$|Since {{the late}} 1980s, animal {{tracking}} via satellite {{has been accomplished}} {{through the use of}} the Argos system, but is limited to larger animals. [...] One major hurdle to tracking the movements of birds and especially insects is creating a transmitter small enough to place on individual animals. The ICARUS project currently implements 5 g radio transmitters that include a GPS receiver, but has plans to use devices weighing less than 1 g in the future. Wikelski believes that within about five years there will be transmitters light enough to attach to a roughly 120 mg honeybee. Since the ISS is only 320 km from the Earth's surface instead of 850 km like the Argos <b>satellites,</b> the ICARUS <b>trackers</b> do not have to create as strong of a radio signal and can therefore be smaller. [...] The transmitters tags are solar-powered and only activate when a satellite passes over them. About 5,000 to 10,000 tags are expected to be in use {{at the time of the}} 2015 launch.|$|R
