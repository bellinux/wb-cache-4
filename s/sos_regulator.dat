40|$|The SOS {{response}} addresses DNA lesions and is conserved in the bacterial domain. The {{response is}} governed by the DNA binding protein LexA, which has been characterized in model microorganisms such as Escherichia coli. However, our understandings of its roles in deep-sea bacteria are limited. Here, the influence of LexA on the phenotype and gene transcription of Shewanella piezotolerans WP 3 (WP 3) was investigated by constructing a lexA deletion strain (WP 3 ΔlexA), which was compared with the wild-type strain. No growth defect was observed for WP 3 ΔlexA. A total of 481 and 108 genes were differentially expressed at 20 °C and 4 °C, respectively, as demonstrated by comparative whole genome microarray analysis. Furthermore, the swarming motility and DMSO reduction assay demonstrated that the function of LexA was related to temperature. The transcription of the lexA gene was up-regulated during cold acclimatization and after cold shock, indicating that the higher expression level of LexA at low temperatures {{may be responsible for}} its temperature-dependent functions. The deep-sea microorganism Shewanella piezotolerans WP 3 is the only bacterial species whose <b>SOS</b> <b>regulator</b> has been demonstrated to be significantly influenced by environmental temperatures to date. Our data support the hypothesis that SOS is a formidable strategy used by bacteria against various environmental stresses...|$|E

40|$|Corporate {{responsibility}} {{has become}} a matter of great concern after the Enron and WorldCom scandals rocked corporate culture. This Article suggests that corporate irresponsibility stems from the failure of corporations to address the concerns of non- shareholders and the failure of shareholders and regulatory watchdogs to look beneath the corporate surface. Competing schools of thought, such as neoclassical economics, progressive corporate theory, and outsider corporate theory, offer divergent analyses of the corporate responsibility dilemma. Regulatory responses to the crisis of corporate conscience remain untested. This Article suggests that our failure to foresee corporate irresponsibility partly comes from over on traditional theories of shareholder primacy.

40|$|The “shadow ” {{banking system}} {{played a major}} role in the {{financial}} crisis, but was not a central focus of the recent Dodd-Frank Law and thus remains largely unregulated. This paper proposes principles for the regulation of shadow banking and describes a specific proposal to implement those principles. We first document the rise of shadow banking over the last three decades, helped by regulatory and legal changes that gave advantages to three main institutions of shadow banking: money-market mutual funds (MMMFs) to capture retail deposits from traditional banks, securitization to move assets of traditional banks off their balance sheets, and repurchase agreements (“repo”) that facilitated the use of securitized bonds in financial transactions as a form of money. A central idea of this paper is that the evolution of a bankruptcy “safe harbor” for repo has been a crucial feature in the growth and efficiency of shadow banking, and <b>so</b> <b>regulators</b> can use access to this safe harbor as the lever to enforce new rules. As for the rules themselves, history has demonstrated two successful methods for the regulation of privately created money: strict guidelines on collateral (used to stabilize national bank notes in the 19 th century), and government-guaranteed insurance (used to stabilize demand deposits in the 20 t...|$|R

The regulator would like to tie prices to the firm's private information in a socially optimal way.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a theory of}} optimal transparency in the financial system when financial institutions have short-term liabilities and are exposed to rollover risk. Our analysis indicates that transparency enhances {{the stability of the}} financial system during crises but may have a destabilizing effect during normal economic times. Thus, the optimal level of transparency is contingent {{on the state of the}} economy, with the regulator increasing disclosure in times of crises. Under this policy, however, an increase in disclosure signals a deterioration of the economy’s fundamentals, <b>so</b> the <b>regulator</b> has incentives to withhold information ex-post. In that case, the regulator may have to commit ex-ante to a degree of transparency which trades off the frequency and magnitude of financial crises. The analysis also considers the possibility that financial institutions, in an attempt to deal with rollover risk, either diversify their risks or increase the liquidity of their balance sheets...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze the {{relationship}} between conformity to executive remuneration standards, corporate ownership, and the level and structure of CEO compensation for large European listed companies in the years 2007 and 2010.

We also show that weaker compliance is associated with lower CEO pay and more cash-based incentive structures. We interpret this “conformity gap” {{from the perspective of}} individual firms and from a societal perspective, with the aim to contribute to frame the policy questions concerning executive pay at controlled corporations. Different policy implications depend on whether the conformity gap reflects a lower need for managerial incentives, given the monitoring by controlling shareholders, or the latter’s willingness to extract private benefits of control. We argue in this paper that the former hypothesis prevails, <b>so</b> that <b>regulators</b> should abstain from increasing the level of enforcement of executive remuneration standards...|$|R
40|$|In four puzzling {{areas of}} {{information}} in politics, simple intuition and simple theory seem to conflict, muddling policy choices. This thesis elaborates theory to help resolve these conflicts. The puzzle of product bans is why regulators don't instead offer the equivalent information, for example through a "would have banned" label. Regulators can want to lie with labels, however, either due to regulatory capture or to correct for market imperfections. Knowing this, consumers discount <b>regulator</b> warnings, and <b>so</b> <b>regulators</b> can prefer bans over the choices of skeptical consumers. But all sides can prefer regulators {{who are unable to}} ban products, since then regulator warnings will be taken more seriously. The puzzle of voter information is why voters are not even more poorly informed; press coverage of politics seems out of proportion to its entertainment value. Voters can, however, want to commit to becoming informed, either by learning about issues or by subscribing to sources, to convince candidates to take favorable positions. Voters can also prefer to be in large groups, and to be ignorant in certain ways. This complicates the evaluation of institutions, like voting pools, which reduce ignorance. The puzzle of group insurance as a cure for adverse selection is why this should be less a problem for groups than individuals. The usual argument about reduced variance of types for groups doesn't work in separating equilibria; what matters is the range, not variance, of types. Democratic group choice can, however, narrow the group type range by failing to represent part of the electorate. Furthermore, random juries can completely eliminate adverse selection losses. The puzzle of persistent political disagreement is that for ideal Bayesians with common priors, the mere fact of a factual disagreement is enough of a clue to induce agreement. But what about agents like humans with severe computational limitations? If such agents agree that they are savvy in being aware of these limitations, then any factual disagreement implies disagreement about their average biases. Yet average bias can in principle be computed without any private information. Thus disagreements seem to be fundamentally about priors or computation, rather than information. ...|$|R

Such sharing opportunities are extensive, covering virtually all network services, and extremely flexible, as entrants can rent facilities in small increments for short duration. Because entrants do not bear the sunk costs, there is an asymmetric allocation of risk and return not properly accounted for in the pricing of network services. This creates a significant investment disincentive. ...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{worldwide}} {{developments in}} financial markets have ignited {{the debate about}} the best approach to regulation of the securities industries. Given that systemic risk reduction is getting into the realm of objectives of the regulatory agencies, new approaches to regulation are called for. Walsh (2008) proposes an alternative mechanism, dubbed institutional-based regulation, as a means of reducing systemic risk. Anand (2009) dispels Walsh's framework by arguing that it does not constitute a new regulatory model, but it is simply a variation of the rules-based regulation. I argue that Walsh's model, as it stands, cannot adequately reduce systemic risk. To do <b>so,</b> securities <b>regulators</b> need to shift paradigm and adopt a new one dubbed regulation by information. Under this paradigm, regulators could reduce systemic risk by becoming 'information providers' during the upward movement of the securities industries and revert back to the traditional rules- or principles-based regulation during protracted periods of equilibrium. risk reduction; securities industry; paradigm shifts; regulatory reforms; institutional-based regulation; rules-based regulation; regulators; regulation by information; information providers; principles-based regulation; equilibrium; financial markets; derivatives; applied financial economics; systemic risk. ...|$|R
