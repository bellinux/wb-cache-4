Jared aggressively confronts Ricko at the beach and Ricko confesses that Tracy's death was not an accident. He had found her walking on the beach after the rape and she asked him to take her home. He agreed, but wanted to have sex with her first. She tried to fight him off and bit him in the process, which enraged him enough to beat her to death.|$|E
5|$|Space Cavern was {{developed}} by Games by Apollo. Company founder Pat Roper had flown programmer Ed Salvo to a Consumer Electronics Show to <b>show</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> Imagic video game Demon Attack.

Space Cavern was released in 1982. Game publisher Panda rereleased an identical version of Space Cavern under the name Space Canyon the following year, and an Atari 5200 port was started but not completed.|$|E

Passing over the Misty Mountains, they are caught by goblins and driven deep underground. Although Gandalf rescues them, Bilbo gets {{separated}} from the others as they flee the goblins. Lost in the goblin tunnels, he stumbles across a mysterious ring and then encounters Gollum, who engages him {{in a game of}} riddles. As a reward for solving all riddles Gollum will <b>show</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> path out of the tunnels, but if Bilbo fails, his life will be forfeit. With the help of the ring, which confers invisibility, Bilbo escapes and rejoins the dwarves, improving his reputation with them.

5|$|The third spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, shows Scrooge a Christmas Day in the future. The ghost {{shows him}} scenes {{involving}} {{the death of}} a disliked man. The man's funeral will only be attended by local businessmen if lunch is provided. His charwoman, his laundress, and the local undertaker steal some of his possessions and sell them to a fence. When Scrooge asks the ghost to show anyone who feels any emotion over the man's death, the ghost can only <b>show</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> pleasure of a poor couple in debt to the man, rejoicing that his death gives them more time to put their finances in order. After Scrooge asks to see some tenderness connected with any death, the ghost shows him Bob Cratchit and his family mourning the passing of Tiny Tim. The ghost then shows Scrooge the man's neglected grave, whose tombstone bears Scrooge's name. Sobbing, Scrooge pledges to the ghost that he will change his ways to avoid this outcome.|$|E

25|$|O'Neal was {{selected}} by the Portland Trail Blazers as the 17th pick in the 1996 NBA draft. The rookie was surrounded by veterans and emerging stars who could <b>show</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> ropes in Portland; forming the frontcourt with him were Arvydas Sabonis, Rasheed Wallace and Clifford R. Robinson. After missing the first 17 games with a bone contusion in his knee, O'Neal made his debut against the Denver Nuggets in December. At 18 years, one month and 22 days, he became the youngest player to play in an NBA game (a mark that was later eclipsed by Andrew Bynum).

Early on the morning of 10 December 1998, the 66th day of his hunger strike, Horne was moved out of hospital and back to Full Sutton Prison. The Home Office said that, because he was refusing treatment, {{there was no need for}} him to be in hospital. By now, Horne was hallucinating and could no longer remember why he was on hunger strike.|$|E
25|$|Stone {{was from}} the West Indies and had been banished from Boston for malfeasance, {{including}} drunkenness, adultery, and piracy. He was known to have powerful connections in other colonies, {{as well as in}} London, and he was expected to use them against the Boston colony. Setting sail from Boston, Stone abducted two Western Niantic men, forcing them to <b>show</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> way up the Connecticut River. Soon after, he and his crew were suddenly attacked and killed by a larger group of Western Niantic. The initial reactions in Boston varied from indifference to outright joy at Stone's death, but the colonial officials later decided to protest the killing. They did not accept the Pequots' excuses that they had been unaware of Stone's nationality. Pequot sachem Sassacus sent some wampum to atone for the killing, but refused the colonists' demands that the warriors responsible for Stone's death be turned over to them for trial and punishment.|$|E

25|$|From 1796 Hoffmann {{obtained}} {{employment as}} a clerk for his uncle, Johann Ludwig Doerffer, who lived in Glogau with his daughter Minna. After passing further examinations he visited Dresden, where he was amazed by the paintings in the gallery, particularly those of Correggio and Raphael. During the summer of 1798 his uncle was promoted to a court in Berlin, {{and the three of}} them moved there in August—Hoffmann's first residence in a large city. It was there that Hoffmann first attempted to promote himself as a composer, writing an operetta called Die Maske and sending a copy to Queen Luise of Prussia. The official reply advised to him to write to the director of the Royal Theatre, a man named Iffland. By the time the latter responded, Hoffmann had passed his third round of examinations and had already left for Posen (Poznań) in South Prussia in the company of his old friend Hippel, with a brief stop in Dresden to <b>show</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> gallery.|$|E
25|$|Śrībhārgavalakṣmaṇasaṃvādaḥ (Sanskrit: श्रीभार्गवलक्ष्मणसंवादः). On Mahendra mountain, Paraśurāma {{comes to}} know that Rāma has broken the Pināka in Mithilā. He also senses that some malevolent kings are {{planning}} to take Sītā away by force and imprison Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa, even though they failed to move the bow of Śiva. Remembering the words of his Guru, Paraśurāma comes in the assembly of Mithilā acting angry {{as a part of}} his final Līlā. His presence terrifies all the Kṣatriya kings in the assembly and they are tamed. Janaka bows down to Paraśurāma and makes Sītā bow down to him as well. Paraśurāma feigns ignorance and asks Janaka to <b>show</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> offender who broke the bow of his Guru. Rāma respectfully tells Paraśurāma that the destroyer of the bow could only be his (Paraśurāma's) slave, and requests his refuge. Paraśurāma tells Rāma to act like a slave and carry out his order of separating the offender from the crowd. Lakṣmaṇa is enraged on seeing Paraśurāma insulting Rāma and replies back mocking Paraśurāma. A verbal duel between the two follows in which Lakṣmaṇa replies with witty rebuttals to Paraśurāma threats. When Lakṣmaṇa repeatedly counters all threats by making fun of Paraśurāma, Paraśurāma raises his axe and lunges forward to kill Lakṣmaṇa. Just then, Rāma starts speaking to calm Paraśurāma down.|$|E
25|$|On {{the first}} night of the quest, the entire company is {{captured}} by three trolls, who plan to eat them. However, Gandalf arrives, imitating the trolls' voices and causing them to fight amongst themselves until the sun rises, which turns them to stone. As Bilbo searches for supplies in their cave, he meets an injured elf, Lianna (Jennifer Hale), who he assists by finding her healing potion. He also finds a dagger, which he calls Sting. The party then move on to the Elven city of Rivendell, where Elrond tells them of a secret entrance into the Lonely Mountain. They then head to the Misty Mountains. During the night, they are attacked by goblins, and Bilbo is knocked unconscious. He awakens alone and lost. As he wanders through the underground passages, he finds a ring, and encounters a creature named Gollum (Daran Norris). Gollum makes a deal with Bilbo; they will play a game of riddles. If Gollum wins, he will eat Bilbo, but if Bilbo wins, Gollum will <b>show</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> way out. Bilbo wins the game, and Gollum says he must get something before he can lead Bilbo out. He then realizes his ring is gone. Bilbo puts the ring on and discovers it makes its wearer invisible. An infuriated Gollum runs to the exit to try to stop Bilbo leaving, unwittingly leading the invisible Bilbo out. He reunites with the dwarves and Gandalf, but the party are then attacked by a groups of goblins and wargs. They climb to the tops of the trees, and are rescued by a band of eagles, who drop them off near Mirkwood Forest.|$|E

Following this, Priyanka Chopra, {{who had worked with}} Baweja in Love Story 2050, was cast to play all twelve of the potential brides, each related to one of the twelve zodiac signs. On casting Chopra, Gowariker said: [...] "I have always liked Priyanka's work, right from [...] She's been fabulous in all her films. So when I thought of somebody doing twelve roles I thought about her, as I thought she had the potential." [...] When Gowariker offered the film to her, Chopra instantly agreed to star in it.|$|E
500|$|Thomas helped {{suppress}} Shays' Rebellion in 1786, {{which earned}} him the rank of major. In the years following, he witnessed and was offended by the continuing persecution of Loyalists in Massachusetts. [...] He realized that in the depressed economic conditions that followed the Revolutionary War, and with his own deep debts, he was unlikely to see his former prosperity again. [...] In 1793, Thomas met in New York City with Mohawk leader Joseph Brant, who offered to <b>show</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> best land for settlement in Upper Canada, where the Crown was encouraging development.
