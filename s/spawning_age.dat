25|$|Blue crab populations {{naturally}} fluctuate {{with annual}} changes in environmental conditions. They {{have been described}} as having a long-term dynamic equilibrium, which was first noted after irregular landings data in the Chesapeake in 1950. This tendency may have made it difficult for managers to predict the severe decline of the Chesapeake’s blue crab populations. Once considered an overwhelmingly abundant annoyance, the declining blue crab population is now the subject of anxiety among fishermen and managers. Over the decade between the mid-1990s to 2004, the population fell from 900 million to around 300 million, and harvest weight fell from 52,000 tons (115,000,000 lbs) to 28,000 tons (62,000,000 lbs). Revenue fell further, from $72 million to $61 million. Long term estimates say that the overall Chesapeake population decreased approximately 70% in the last few decades. Even more alarming, the number of females capable of reproducing, known as <b>spawning</b> <b>age</b> females, has plummeted 84% in just a few decades. Survival and addition of juveniles to the harvestable crab population is also low. Many factors are to blame for low blue crab numbers, including high fishing pressure, environmental degradation, and disease prevalence.|$|E
50|$|Aging data {{indicate}} Antarctic toothfish are relatively fast-growing when young, but then growth slows later in life. They reach {{about one-third of}} maximum size after five years, and half maximum by 10 years, after which growth slows considerably. To grow fast when small is an adaptation of most predatory fish, e.g., sharks, {{so as not to}} be small for very long. The maximum age recorded so far has been 48 years. Antarctic toothfish take a long time to mature (13 years for males, 17 years for females) and once mature may not spawn every year, though the actual spawning interval is unknown. Only a few Antarctic toothfish with mature eggs have ever been caught, meaning knowledge is sparse about fecundity. They spawn sometime during winter. Large, mature, older fish have been caught among the seamounts of the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge, a location thus thought to be important for spawning. Smaller, subadult Antarctic toothfish tend to concentrate in shallower waters on the continental shelf, while a large portion of the older fish are found on in the continental slope. This sequestering by size and age could be another adaptation for small fish to avoid being eaten by large ones. The recruitment potential of Antarctic toothfish, a measure of both fecundity and survival to <b>spawning</b> <b>age,</b> is not known.|$|E

DNA microsatellite loci and smolt age were used to probabilistically assign returning spawners to their stock of origin. Data {{for this study were}} based on approximately 2600 catch samples of the five most common wild and four sea-ranched, hatchery-reared stocks. <b>Spawning</b> <b>age,</b> and sex ratio differed both within and between these wild, and sea-ranched groups.

In both sexes, the mean age at maturity was lower in the hatchery-reared, sea-ranched stocks than in naturally reproducing stocks. In the 2000 s, there was a weak decreasing trend in the male <b>spawning</b> <b>age,</b> but not in that of females. The sex-ratio of the spawners was female dominant in the naturally reproducing stocks, but male dominant in hatchery-reared stocks. Published historical data from two of the same rivers suggest that the majority of males were multi-sea-winter spawners in the 1930 s, and variation in the age distribution of the spawners has become narrower and skewed towards a younger age in the present data (2000 – 2009) compared to the earlier situation...|$|E

40|$|The {{knowledge}} and scientific history of maternal and paternal aspects of reproduction dates back several decades, though only recently are fishery scientists and managers giving this subject area greater {{attention in the}} provision of management advice. This paper outlines and summarizes several recent advances made in understanding the importance of variation in gadoid reproductive output as a function of <b>spawner</b> <b>age,</b> size, maturation, condition and reproductive history. An assembled score-card applied to 45 Canadian Atlantic gadoid stock assessments conducted from 1985 to 1998 portrays the evolution and current degree to which this scientific knowledge has been incorporated into fishery advice in eastern Canada. For future research, recommendations are made which promote the integration of basic reproductive biology into groundfish stock assessments. These emerging policies encourage managers worldwide to initiate relevant sampling programs which will lead to improved stock conservation reference points. A new term referred to as stock reproductive potential (SRP) is introduced. Compared to spawning stock biomass and population fecundity, SRP more accurately represents the annual variation in a stock's ability to produce viable eggs and larvae that may eventually recruit to the adult population or fishery. SRP is a term (concept) which will likely evolve in such a manner as to provide a more accurate measure of a stock's reproductive potential...|$|R

To explore the above two bias problems with f ield-collected European pilchard (Sardina pilchardus, known regionally as the Iberian sardine), a method was developed in which the time elapsed from spawning (POF age) was estimated from the size of POFs (i. e., from the cross-sectional area in histological sections). The potential effect of the preservative type and embedding material on POF size and the effect of ambient water temperature on POF resorption rate are taken into account with this method.

40|$|Frequently {{wildlife}} managers {{must decide}} how to allocate limited resources amongst a plurality of threatened salmon stocks. In the absence of adequate abundance data, knowledge of stocks life histories {{might be used to}} rank risk of extinction thereby allowing more efficient allocation of resources. In Chapter one I assess how differences in life histories contribute to relative risk of extinction using Pacific salmon as an example. Using simulations of coho and chinook salmon. I find increased spawning at multiple ages causes the fate of each cohort to be linked to the success of other cohorts. This novel effect I refer to as cohort coupling. Since many assume that density dependence is a stabilizing force. Chapter two examines this assumption in terms of extinction risk for coho salmon. Here again I find that life history plays a role in determining risk. along with environmental variation and quasi-extinction threshold. Key also is how density dependence is introduced into the model. I find the widely held view that density dependence is stabilizing is of limited value since density dependence can either increase or decrease probability of extinction. Chapter three explores the use of a diffusion approximation as a tool for understanding population dynamics of Pacific salmon. Diffusion approximations have a long history in ecology as models of population genetics and population growth. Modeling salmon using a diffusion approximation requires special consideration because salmon are both semelparous and anadromous. Diffusion estimates of probability of extinction are accurate only for a limited range of life histories. Since salmon exhibit environmentally influenced variability in <b>spawning</b> <b>age.</b> Chapter four explores the effect variability in <b>spawning</b> <b>age</b> has on probability of extinction. I find that when variability is confined to fraction spawning at a single age. the probability of extinction is proportional to the integrated elasticity of A. for realized fecundity at that age. Additionally simulations indicated that variability in fraction spawning is most important when it affects the dominant age class of a cohort...|$|E

A numerical model was developed {{to examine the effects}} of potential restoration measures on the spawning population. Adjustable parameters in the model include upstream and downstream passage rates at each dam, sex ratio, <b>spawning</b> <b>age</b> structure (including repeat spawning), upstream trap and transport, and juvenile stocking. Future recruitment is based on the number of females reaching upstream spawning habitat. Under the assumption that only fish reared upstream will return there to spawn, existing data were used to calibrate the model to a good approximation of adult returns to Conowingo Dam over past thirty years, suggesting that the trends observed over that period are consistent with known numbers for volitional passage, trucked adults, and stocked juveniles.

40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} {{of the effects of}} changing climate on physical ocean conditions and long-term changes in fish populations adds to the need to understand the effects of stochastic forcing on marine populations. Cohort resonance is of particular interest because it involves selective sensitivity to specific time scales of environmental variability, including that of mean age of reproduction, and, more importantly, very low frequencies (i. e., trends). We present an age-structured model for two Pacific salmon species with environmental variability in survival rate and in individual growth rate, hence <b>spawning</b> <b>age</b> distribution. We use computed frequency response curves and analysis of the linearized dynamics to obtain two main results. First, the frequency response of the population is affected by the life history stage at which variability affects the population; varying growth rate tends to excite periodic resonance in age structure, while varying survival tends to excite low-frequency fluctuation with more effect on total population size. Second, decreasing adult survival strengthens the cohort resonance effect at all frequencies, a finding that addresses the question of how fishing and climate change will interact.

Sampling was performed with purse seine, beach seine, and otter trawl. Adult shad and {{large numbers of}} juveniles from the 1979 <b>spawning</b> (<b>age</b> group I) entered the estuary from the ocean in May 1980. Adults continued on their upstream migration while age group I juveniles appeared to congregate in the estuary, joining those (age group I) that had over-wintered there. Many young-of-the-year shad (age group 0) reached the estuary on their seaward migration in September 1980, during which time most of the age group I juveniles migrated back to the ocean. By January 1981, large numbers of young-of-the-year shad migrated to the ocean, although a few remained in the estuary. The stomachs of 26 adult shad and 503 juveniles were analyzed. Adults {{did not appear to}} feed during their upstream migration, but juvenile shad fed extensively. Diet varied with season, gear type, and salinity zone. Calanoid copepods were important throughout the year, but Corophium salmonis and Neomysis mercedis were important during fall, winter, and spring.

This studyexam-ined the relationbetween early survival, age atmaturity, and the demographic compositionof spawners inmany cod andhaddock stocks. Reported measures of fecundity andmaturitywere used to estimate total egg production for comparisonwith numbers at age 1 and age at 50 %maturity. The instantaneous rate of population growth (r) was estimated for cohorts from life history tables during periods when spawning biomasswas depleted (e. g.,Bpa) using reproductive and mortality data for stocks. Age-specific survival was found to be far more important than reproductive rate in determiningpopulationgrowth rate. Stocks that experienced lowandmore variable survivalmaturedearly andhadahigh relative fecundity. Hence, while earlymaturing stocks have the potential for high population growth following favourable recruitment events, theywould not be expected to recover any faster than latematuring stocks because of the generally low early survival rate that they experience. Measures of <b>spawner</b> <b>age</b> diversity andmean agewere found to be positively correlated with offspring survivorship in a few cod stocks. However, in general, it appears difficult to infer recovery potential from life history characteristics, which may be expected, given that regional variation in reproductive success will ultimately be expected to shape local reproductive schedules...|$|R

Fishing pressure has been heavy over a prolonged period and the recent decades have shown dramatic decline in abundance of many stocks. The Arcto-norwegian (northeast Arctic) cod stock in the Barents Sea is now the largest. We show that the age composition of the spawning stock has changed distinctly during the last 60 years, the average age of spawners has decreased from between 10 and 11 in the late 1940 s to 7 - 8 now.
