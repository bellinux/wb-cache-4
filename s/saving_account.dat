Abstract This bachelor's thesis evaluates the currently most popular types of <b>savings</b> <b>accounts</b> and their characteristics of use in everyday life. The thesis {{is divided into two}} parts where the first part gives an <b>account</b> of various <b>savings</b> <b>account</b> types and elaborates on their pros and cons from the customer's perspective. A very important factor for the comparison of different types of <b>savings</b> <b>accounts</b> is the interconnection of the three vertices of an investment triangle representing risk, liquidity and profit. The second part of the thesis is more practical and presents two types of <b>savings</b> <b>accounts</b> offered by three different financial institutions which more or less vary. The thesis then concludes by illustrating the differences between various types of <b>savings</b> <b>accounts</b> and summarizes the key findings. Keywords: saving, bank, financial produc...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the progression of}} savings between adolescence and young adulthood. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we ask whether the likelihood of having a <b>savings</b> <b>account</b> in young adulthood {{and the amount of}} savings can be significantly predicted by two factors: having a <b>savings</b> <b>account</b> during adolescence and having parents who own assets. Descriptive statistics reveal that adolescents with <b>savings</b> <b>accounts</b> are more often White, employed, and live in households in which the head is married, has more education, and owns assets. Propensity score analyses confirm that young adults {{are more likely to have}} a <b>savings</b> <b>account</b> when they have a <b>savings</b> <b>account</b> as adolescents. Some evidence suggests that adolescents whose parents have savings on their behalf and have higher net worth are more likely to have higher amounts of savings as young adults. Findings suggest that parents play an important role in modeling saving habits for adolescents. Further, our findings suggest that having a <b>savings</b> <b>account</b> in adolescence leads to an increased likelihood of having a <b>savings</b> <b>account</b> in young adulthood; however, this finding requires confirmation in future research...|$|R

The risk management of <b>saving</b> <b>accounts</b> remains a big challenge for banks and simultaneously raises serious concerns by some regulators. In this paper, we focus on the interest rate risk management of <b>savings</b> <b>accounts.</b> By constructing the replicating portfolio and simulating six scenarios for the market rate and client rates, we show that under the severest scenario, some banks in the Czech Republic might face a capital shortage up to 22 % in next two years if market rates start to increase dramatically. We conclude that <b>savings</b> <b>accounts</b> are risky instruments that cannot be hedged by standard risk mitigation techniques. Since <b>savings</b> <b>accounts</b> in the Czech Republic are not subject to any special regulation yet, we propose imposing stricter regulation and supervision (the Belgium framework might be an inspiring model to consider) ...|$|R
