They then visited the Coronado Islands, Concepcíon Bay and San Lucas Cove, collecting specimens at each stop.

25|$|Depictions of rats {{in fiction}} are {{historically}} inaccurate and negative. The most common falsehood is the squeaking almost always heard in otherwise realistic portrayals (i.e. nonanthropomorphic). While the recordings {{may be of}} actual squeaking rats, the noise is uncommon – they may do so only if distressed, hurt, or annoyed. Normal vocalizations are very high-pitched, well outside the range of human hearing. Rats are also often cast in vicious and aggressive roles when in fact, their shyness helps keep them undiscovered for <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>in</b> an infested home.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} concept {{included the}} routine overhaul and refurbishment {{of the fleet}} at LT's Aldenham Works, usually every five years. The buses were completely stripped down and rebuilt, and left the works almost as new. As the number of Routemasters declined, financial cutbacks and newer buses not suited to this practice were introduced, the overhaul routine was abandoned and Aldenham Works closed in November 1986. The thoroughness of the Aldenham system was the primary reason why the Routemaster and its predecessors have lasted <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>in</b> London service.|$|E

Their ancestry primarily goes back to the original 13 colonies and for this reason many of them today simply claim American ancestry.

The Bard {{goes on to say that}} 12 days later, the Royal Navy ship Commodore arrived, and after receiving warning (from one of the sailors) about the lecherous intentions of the sailors, the women of Canna fled into the countryside and caves, until they were certain that the ship had departed; one pregnant woman miscarried from spending <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>in</b> the cold, and died.|$|E

A law to create a new offence of Mafia conspiracy, and confiscate Mafia assets was introduced by Pio La Torre but it had been stalled in parliament for two years, La Torre was murdered 30 April 1982. In May 1982, the Italian government sent Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa, a general of the Italian Carabinieri, to Sicily with orders to crush the Mafia. However, not long after arriving, on 3 September 1982, the General was gunned down in the city centre, his young wife by his side. Sicilians rose up in outrage. Outside the church, the politicians who attended were jeered and spat on, and blamed by Sicilians for tolerating the Mafia for <b>so</b> <b>long.</b> <b>In</b> response, the Italian government finally offered investigators the backing they needed, and Pio La Torre's law was passed 10 days later.|$|E

500|$|After Baldwin was {{defeated}} at the 1929 British parliamentary election, Ramsay MacDonald of the Labour Party became prime minister. MacDonald desired {{a conference of}} Indian and British leaders in London to discuss India's future, {{a course of action}} supported by Jinnah. Three Round Table Conferences followed over as many years, none of which resulted in a settlement. [...] Jinnah was a delegate to the first two conferences, but was not invited to the last. [...] He remained in Britain for most of the period 1930 through 1934, practising as a barrister before the Privy Council, where he dealt with a number of India-related cases. His biographers disagree over why he remained <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>in</b> Britain—Wolpert asserts that had Jinnah been made a Law Lord, he would have stayed for life, and that Jinnah alternatively sought a parliamentary seat. [...] Early biographer Hector Bolitho denied that Jinnah sought to enter the British Parliament, while Jaswant Singh deems Jinnah's time in Britain as a break or sabbatical from the Indian struggle. [...] Bolitho called this period [...] "Jinnah's years of order and contemplation, wedged in between the time of early struggle, and the final storm of conquest".|$|E

500|$|Headley is {{regarded}} by critics {{as one of}} the best batsmen from the Caribbean and one of the greatest batsmen of all time. In his history of West Indies cricket, Michael Manley described Headley as [...] "the yardstick against whom all other West Indian batsmen are measured". In 1988, The Cricketer magazine placed him in an all-time West Indian team, as did a panel of judges for another such team in July 2010, while in 2004, another panel of experts named him among the top five West Indian players. He was given the nicknames [...] "the Black Bradman" [...] and [...] "Atlas" [...] by commentators, and was the first world-class batsman from the West Indies who was black. According to historian Gideon Haigh, his role was made harder by the weakness of his colleagues, as few outstanding players find it easy to play in teams which lose frequently. Although he was a naturally attacking player, Headley felt the need to play cautiously owing to the way his team depended on him. C. L. R. James believed that no other great batsman had to carry such a burden for <b>so</b> <b>long.</b> <b>In</b> the years before the war, Headley scored 25.61% of the runs scored in Tests by West Indies, more than twice as many as the next best batsman, and two-thirds of the team's centuries, scoring ten of the team's first fourteen centuries in Test cricket. Headley usually batted at number three and as the opening batsmen were often dismissed quickly, he frequently began his innings early.|$|E
