The two accelerators {{are in the same}} tunnel and have the same radius R, for operation at BR = 100 Tm and 200 Tm respectively. Su-perconducting magnets are necessary to reach the appropriate magnetic field and may considerably reduce the investment and operating costs, in comparison with conventional magnets. An R&D program was initiated to develop dipole magnets with maximum fields of 2 and 4 Tesla and dipole ramp rates of 4 T/s and 1 T/s, respectively. These requirements were chosen to achieve high average beam intensities. The SIS 100 dipole is a window-frame Nuclotron-type dipole and is being developed in collaboration with JINR (Dubna, Russia). This magnet has been operated at 4 T/s up to a field of 2 Tesla. Reduced losses and im-proved magnetic field quality are required for the SIS 100 accel-erator. In a separate collaboration with BNL (Upton, USA), the one coil layer cos θ-type RHIC arc dipole, originally designed for operation at 3. 5 Tesla with a rather slow ramp rate of 0. 042 T/s, will be upgraded for the SIS 200 accelerator to operate at a ramp rate of 1 T/s, up to a field of 4 T. R&D for a 6 Tesla dipole was started in collaboration with IHEP (Protvino, Russia), to further increase the rigidity of the SIS 200 ring to 300 Tm. Alternative schemes have been investigated.

The activity is in an advanced stage of its development and it is moving towards its completion in late 2010. Over the last year (2009) important objectives have been achieved [1, 2, 3]: 1) The finalization in May of the conceptual design and the project engineering (following a dedicated technical review held in November 2008). 3) The development of an innovative low-loss superconducting cable (July 2009). The conductor critical current density was measured to be 2400 A/mm 2 at 4. 5 K and 5 T (result on extracted stands). With respect to the specification we have a 10 % degradation causing a stability margin of 0. 8 K wrt 1. 0 K designed. The n-value is 34, the effective filament diameter 3 µm and the twist pitch 6 mm. These results were considered very good in view of the ac operating conditions. 4) The design of the horizontal cryostat (see Fig. 1) hosting the dipole at GSI (May 2009) has been finished and the contract awarded to a company (October 2009). 5) The start of the model cold mass construction at ASG Superconductors (this is actually the heart of the program) scheduled to be completed by April 2010.

No increase of the width of the (220) or (322) tetragonal diffraction peaks and microstrains could be found in the <b>superconducting</b> sample from <b>synchrotron</b> XRD measurements.

These deviations occur around 150 K for both F dopings, with distinct differences among the two compounds, i. e., they decrease at low doping and increase for the superconducting sample. The data do not support a hidden phase transition to an orthorhombic phase in the superconducting compound, but point to an isostructural lattice deformation. Based on the absence of magnetic effects in this temperature range for the superconducting sample, we attribute the observed lattice anomalies to the formation of local lattice distortions that, being screened by the carriers, can only acquire long-range coherence by means of a structural phase transition at low doping levels...|$|R
