5|$|Although it was series co-creator and {{producer}} Gerry Anderson's original plan to film with actual alligators, AP Films instead acquired {{a group of}} juvenile crocodiles from a private zoo in northern England; these would double as re-sized alligators on <b>scale</b> <b>model</b> sets and water tanks. With {{the exception of a}} five-foot (1.5m) specimen, which was too aggressive to be removed from its box, the animals were three feet (0.91m) long. The crew kept the on-set water tanks heated to a suitably warm temperature and used electric shocks to induce movement from the reptiles. They were unpredictable and very difficult to control and film, either bathing {{in the heat of the}} studio lights or disappearing into the tanks and remaining submerged for hours. To make the crocodiles more visible to the cameras, the crew fixed them to guiding rods and co-ordinated their movements. The heavy presence of the animals in both puppet and <b>scale</b> <b>model</b> shots resulted in a closer-than-normal degree of collaboration between the puppet and effects crews.|$|E
5|$|Crowley {{started the}} process of {{designing}} the Tumbler for the film by model bashing.

Following the <b>scale</b> <b>model</b> creation, a crew of over 30 people, including Crowley and engineers Chris Culvert and Annie Smith, carved a full-size replica of the Tumbler out of a large block of Styrofoam in two months.|$|E

5|$|Alex Funke, {{who worked}} on The Lord of the Rings, {{directed}} the film's miniatures unit. These include 1/24th and 1/100th scale miniatures of Miraz's castle. A <b>scale</b> <b>model</b> was built of the Narnians' cave hideouts during the climactic battle, which the actor playing the giant Wimbleweather was filmed against. One of the improvements made over the previous film {{was to make the}} centaurs walk during dialogue scenes, so Cornell John as Glenstorm wore Power Risers (mechanical stilts with springs), to mimic a horse's canter and height. The animatronic Minotaur heads were also improved to properly lip sync, although this was not as successful as hoped and had to be revamped digitally.|$|E

A series of toys were also made available in 1998, featuring two variations of the marine, another hydralisk and a Protoss zealot. In addition, 1/30 <b>scale</b> <b>model</b> kits for the marine and hydralisk were released in 1999 by Academy Hobby Model Kits.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to cast Billy Campbell as Cliff Secord caused mixed emotions amongst Disney executives. Director Joe Johnston and creator Dave Stevens believed Campbell {{was perfect for}} the role, but Disney wanted an A-list actor. Johnston eventually convinced Disney otherwise. Campbell was {{not familiar with the}} comic book when he got the part but quickly read it, in addition to books on aviation. He also prepared by listening to 1940s period music. The actor had a fear of flying but overcame it {{with the help of the}} film's aerial coordinator, Craig Hosking. To ensure his safety, Campbell was doubled for almost all of the flying sequences in conventional aircraft. Ultimately, a <b>scale</b> <b>model</b> devised by ILM puppeteer Tom St. Amand was used for all the rocket pack scenes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Scale</b> <b>models</b> {{were used}} to {{duplicate}} many of the flying scenes in the film. When Martin Scorsese began planning his aviation epic, {{a decision was made}} to film flying sequences with <b>scale</b> <b>models</b> rather than CGI special effects. The critical reaction to the CGI models in Pearl Harbor (2001) had been a crucial factor in Scorsese's decision to use full-scale static and <b>scale</b> <b>models</b> in this case. The building and filming of the flying models proved both cost-effective and timely.|$|R

40|$|The California Air Resources Board is {{conducting}} an emissions inventory and air quality modeling {{study in the}} Wilmington neighborhood of Los Angeles {{as part of its}} ongoing Neighborhood Assessment Program.

We use local <b>scale</b> <b>models</b> to estimate pollutant concentrations caused by the direct transport of pollutants from sources in the modeling domain. Because local <b>scale</b> <b>modeling</b> results are dependent upon the quantity and location of emissions, we are focusing on developing and evaluating a spatially resolved emissions inventory. Our local <b>scale</b> <b>modeling</b> inventory is divided into three non-traditional categories based on data collection methodologies: industrial and commercial facilities, on-road mobile sources, and offroad engines related to marine terminals and other sources.
