500|$|Kristine Sutherland (Joyce) was {{informed}} {{during the third}} season that her character would be killed off, which she accepted because she intended {{to spend time in}} Europe. She is absent from most of the fourth season because she was traveling. She reported that the atmosphere on the set of [...] "The Body" [...] was strange and tense because she had been a regular character through the series and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> playing a corpse. She found the part difficult to play, not only for the stillness, but getting into the make-up, and lying on the morgue table with other bodies.|$|E
500|$|After {{the quick}} {{removal of the}} messages, Berger commented that Carey had been [...] "obviously {{exhausted}} and not thinking clearly" [...] when she posted the letters. Two days later on July26, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> hospitalized, citing [...] "extreme exhaustion" [...] and a [...] "physical and emotional breakdown". Following the heavy media coverage surrounding Carey's publicized breakdown and hospitalization, Virgin Records and 20th Century Fox delayed the release of both the film's soundtrack and the film itself for three weeks: from August21 to September11 and from August31 to September21, respectively. Following Carey's absence from the public eye, {{as well as her}} abandonment of promotional appearances for the film and soundtrack, her unprecedented $100million five-album record deal with Virgin Records (EMI Records) was bought out for $50million. The decision was brought out due to the low sales of the project, as well as the negative publicity surrounding her breakdown. Soon after, Carey flew to Capri, Italy for a period of five months, in which she began writing material for her new album, stemming from all the personal experiences she had endured throughout the past year. Additionally, she founded her own label modeled after her initials, MonarC Entertainment, and signed a new three-album record deal with Island Records, valued at over $23million.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the age of}} 15 (or 19) years, {{she married}} Emmett Burke Collins (1842-1872), a {{disabled}} Union Army veteran, and a rising young lawyer of Rochester. Soon after, the husband having lost re-election as a Justice of Peace, they sought the mild climate of Louisiana, removing to Ponchatoula where her father-in-law had a plantation. There, she gained perfect health. A son died in infancy. Within a year after her arrival in Louisiana, the husband died by accidental gun shot. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> made a widow, among comparative strangers, and left almost alone in the world. Up to that time, she had been financially well off, but after the grief had subsided, she recognized {{that she needed to}} support herself.|$|E

2500|$|After refitting, she {{departed}} Pearl Harbor on 4 August 1944 as {{a member}} of a coordinated attack group called [...] "Ed's Eradicators". With wolfpack members [...] and , she set her course, via Midway Island, for the South China Sea. She arrived in her patrol area on 25 August. Her first action came hours after midnight on 31 August when the wolf pack attacked a convoy. Queenfish was the first to score a hit, and Tunny witnessed the explosion of a tanker, the victim of her sister submarine. As Tunny maneuvered in the bright moonlight, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> startled by gunfire, which seemed to those on board to come from all directions. She dove and avoided damage from the depth charges which soon followed. Later on the same day, a hit by Barb alerted the convoy's air escort to Tunnys presence; and she was forced down again without opportunity to launch her torpedoes. Time after time, the submarine surfaced only to be forced down by escorting planes as the attack on the convoy continued into the evening.|$|E
2500|$|James Dean {{was born}} February 8, 1931, at the Seven Gables {{apartment}} {{on the corner of}} 4th Street and McClure Street in Marion, Indiana, the only child of Winton Dean (January 17, 1908 – February 21, 1995) and Mildred Marie Wilson (September 15, 1910 – July 14, 1940). His parents were of mostly English ancestry, with smaller amounts of German, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh. Six years after his father had left farming to become a dental technician, Dean and his family moved to Santa Monica, California. He was enrolled at Brentwood Public School in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, but transferred soon afterward to the McKinley Elementary School. The family spent several years there, and by all accounts, Dean was very close to his mother. According to Michael DeAngelis, she was [...] "the only person capable of understanding him". In 1938, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> struck with acute stomach pain and [...] quickly began to lose weight. She died of uterine cancer when Dean was nine years old.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} sixth season opened, the {{producers}} attempted {{to add a}} child character to the show. Tess Holland, as played by Alisan Porter (who had starred on ABC's short-lived Chicken Soup the previous fall), was introduced as the troublemaking-but-immensely-cute little girl who lived upstairs from Larry and Balki. Tess appeared in the season's second episode, [...] "New Kid on the Block", when Balki agrees to babysit her, causing an uproar {{both at home and}} at the Chronicle. While Porter was supposed to be on full-time, and even credited in the opening title sequence of the episode, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> dropped, never to be seen again. The experiment of adding a child to the cast was partially influenced by the network as well, since ABC's TGIF lineup was wishing to incorporate the child-and-preteen demographic into its audience. While the content of Perfect Strangers could often appeal to the family as a whole, it had never had children in the regular cast. A similar infusion happened a few months later on sister show Going Places, which had also started with a more adult tone.|$|E

2500|$|In December 1942, Queen Mary carried 16,082 American {{soldiers}} from New York to Great Britain, a standing {{record for the}} most passengers ever transported on one vessel. During this trip, while [...] from Scotland during a gale, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> hit broadside by a rogue wave that may have reached a height of [...] An account of this crossing {{can be found in}} Carter's book. As quoted in the book, Carter's father, Dr. Norval Carter, part of the 110th Station Hospital on board at the time, wrote in a letter that at one point Queen Mary [...] "damned near capsized... One moment the top deck was at its usual height and then, swoom! Down, over, and forward she would pitch." [...] It was calculated later that the ship rolled 52 degrees, and would have capsized had she rolled another 3 degrees. The incident inspired Paul Gallico to write his novel, The Poseidon Adventure (1969) and carry the incident to a fictional extreme. This was adapted as a 1972 film by the same name, in which the SS Poseidon is turned upside-down, and the trapped passengers try to escape. Naturally parts of the film were shot in the actual Queen Mary, conveniently docked in Long Beach.|$|E
