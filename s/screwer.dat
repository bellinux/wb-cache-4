50|$|Dr. Jimmy Nookey (Jim Dale) is an {{accident-prone}} {{young doctor}} who quickly {{falls in love}} with a patient named Goldie Locks (Barbara Windsor) at Long Hampton Hospital. With the hospital Matron (Hattie Jacques) and his moody boss Dr. Frederick Carver (Kenneth Williams) watching his every move, Dr. Nookey drinks a fruit punch spiked by jealous Dr. Stoppage (Charles Hawtrey). The drunk Nookey ends up crashing through a window on a hospital trolley, after he had almost got into bed with a patient. Goldie leaves Nookey, as the latter is not interested in marriage. Meanwhile, Carver and his rich patient Ellen Moore (Joan Sims) dispatch the disgraced Nookey to Moore's medical mission in the Beatific Islands, where it rains for nine months of the year. Nookey discovers Gladstone <b>Screwer</b> (Sid James), the local medicine man, who has a weight-loss serum. Nookey soon returns to England and opens a new surgery with Mrs. Moore, much to the anger of Carver. While Matron joins Dr. Nookey's clinic, Carver and Stoppage plot to try to steal the serum. Stoppage dresses as a female patient to effect the theft, but his luck runs out when Nookey catches him in the act. Goldie returns to have the serum as well, much to Nookey's chagrin. Gladstone quickly discovers that Nookey is making a fortune from his serum, and cuts off his supply to deliver the serum in person and get in on the action. Nookey prevaricates, so Gladstone gives him a serum which in fact seems to cause sex changes! The movie ends with Nookey and Goldie getting married and the rest of the staff of the Long Hampton Hospital becoming friends again.|$|E
