5|$|Back at Rome, Tiberius instituted the Sodales Augustales, a priesthood of {{the cult}} of Augustus which Germanicus became a member of. When news arrived of his raid, Tiberius commemorated his {{services}} in the Senate with elaborate, but insincere praise: the proceedings gave him joy that the mutiny had been suppressed, but anxiety at the glory and popularity afforded to Germanicus. The Senate, in absence of Germanicus, voted that he <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> triumph. Ovid's Fasti dates the Senate vote of Germanicus' triumph to 1 January AD 15.|$|E
5|$|President John F. Kennedy {{solicited}} MacArthur's {{counsel in}} 1961. The {{first of two}} meetings was held shortly after the Bay of Pigs Invasion. MacArthur was extremely critical of the military advice given to Kennedy, and cautioned the young President to avoid a U.S. military build-up in Vietnam, pointing out that domestic problems <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> much greater priority. Shortly before his death, MacArthur gave similar advice to President Lyndon B. Johnson.|$|E

5|$|While {{playing for}} Liechtenstein against England in a 2004 European Championships {{qualifying}} match at Old Trafford in 2003, Burgmeier was spotted by Max Houghton. Although Liechtenstein lost 2–0, Houghton {{was impressed by}} Burgmeier's stamina and effort. When Burgmeier was released by Basel in 2008, Houghton, then 12years old, suggested to his grandfather, George Houghton, who was chairman of English side Darlington that he <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> trial. Following a successful trial, Burgmeier, who was keen to move abroad, was signed by the League Two-side on a one-year contract {{at the end of}} August 2008 to become the first Liechtensteiner to play in England.|$|E
5|$|Billy Bonds is {{the only}} manager to have managed both clubs. He {{was in charge of}} West Ham from February 1990 to August 1994, {{managing}} the club for 227 games as the team yo-yoed between the First and Second divisions. He guided them to two promotions and one relegation. He resigned in August 1994. He was appointed as Millwall manager in May 1997 by chairman Theo Paphitis— an unpopular decision with many Lions fans due to his West Ham allegiance. Bonds, from south London, had several family members who were Millwall fans; a fact which meant some supporters felt he <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> chance. After a good start, the team narrowly avoided relegation, finishing 18th in the Second Division. Bonds was sacked in May 1998, having been in charge of the side for only 53 games.|$|E
5|$|Domenicali insisted {{there were}} no team orders {{and that it was}} Massa who chose to allow Alonso past. Alonso reaffirmed Domenicalli's {{statement}} and admitted he was surprised when Massa slowed and claimed that he felt Massa had a gearbox issue. FIA reporter Lars Osterlind investigated the incident and sent a 160-page report to the World Motor Sport Council which concluded that Alonso <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> five-second time penalty which would hand the victory to Massa. He also wanted a suspended penalty on the loss of Ferrari's Drivers' and Constructors' points scored in the event. At the World Motor Sport Council meeting held in Paris on 8 September, the tribunal elected to uphold the $100,000 fine imposed on Ferrari, decided that no further action would be taken against the team, and that Formula One's Sporting Working Group would review the rule that prohibited team orders. In December, the FIA announced the rule on team orders would be revoked because it was difficult to enforce. Parallels were made between the race and the 2002 Austrian Grand Prix where Barrichello was ordered by Ferrari to concede the event's victory to Schumacher on its final lap.|$|E

5|$|The {{roads that}} have carried US12 in Michigan {{have been given}} a number of {{memorial}} highway names. In 1922, after the publication of Main Street by Sinclair Lewis that street name took on a pejorative connotation. The newspaper in Jackson advocated that the main road from Detroit to Chicago which formed the main street through many communities in southern Michigan <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> new name. It was already labeled the Michigan–Detroit–Chicago Highway on travel maps of the time, so the paper suggested that the roadway should be renamed to create the longest street in the country. Both Chicago and Detroit had streets named Michigan Avenue, so that is what the newspaper suggested for a new name. Albion was the first community to change the name of its street followed by Jackson and Marshall in 1924, Battle Creek in 1928 and Kalamazoo in 1929.|$|E

25|$|Ammolite {{is usually}} {{fashioned}} into freeform cabochons and mounted in gold, with diamonds as accents. Due to its delicacy, ammolite is best reserved {{for use in}} pendants, earrings, and brooches; if used as a ring stone, ammolite <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> hard protective cap, namely one of synthetic spinel as used in triplets. Whole polished ammonites of appropriately small size may also be mounted in jewelry.

Whether {{that should be a}} vegetable fat or an animal fat (such as lard) is hotly contested. Saturated fats are more stable than polyunsaturated fats, which tend to go rancid more quickly. If the oven is used regularly, this poses no issue. Mustard oil provides the highest temperature resistance, which would be conducive to cooking.|$|E

Escherichia coli is a badly classified species as some strains share only 20% of their genome. Being so diverse it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> higher taxonomic ranking.

During his second term in the state {{legislature}} he was involved in debates surrounding the ratification of the United States Constitution which he wholeheartedly supported. Following ratification he opposed efforts by Patrick Henry and others to call a second constitutional convention to add a bill of rights, believing the new system <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> chance to operate before wholesale alterations were made. He also believed that the new congress could be trusted to add the necessary amendments.|$|E

25|$|Ibn Sina {{refers to}} the {{secondary}} education stage of maktab schooling as the period of specialization, when pupils should begin to acquire manual skills, regardless of their social status.

25|$|After many {{success at}} the 1000km enduro events, Meier was {{selected}} for the German Trophy Team for the 1937 International Six Day Trial {{to be held in}} Wales. Along with teammates Joseph Stelzer and Ludwig Wiggerl Kraus who competed with an 600cc BMW sidecar outfit, the German Trophy team then used 500cc flat-twin BMW motor-cycles. At the end of the six day trial the British and German Trophy teams where level on points. The event was to be decided on a speed-test at the new Castle Donington race circuit. The British Trophy team used 350cc machines and due to the handicap system, the 500cc BMW motorcycles had to complete an extra-lap to win the 1937 ISDT. Two of the British riders had extensive road-racing experience with Vic Brittain riding a Norton and George Rowley riding an AJS. Despite having no road racing experience, Meier won the Donington speed-trial, but the German Trophy Team lost the event to Great Britain Team by 10 seconds on the handicap system. The German Team officials were so impressed by Meier's performance that they suggested to BMW that he <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> <b>a</b> trial for their race-team.|$|E
