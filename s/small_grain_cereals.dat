50|$|The {{collections}} {{from the}} Germplasm Resources Unit were brought {{together in the}} mid-1980s from working collection from several research institutes from around the UK that worked with <b>small</b> <b>grain</b> <b>cereals</b> and legumes, including the extinct Plant Breeding Institute. This centralisation effort {{was supported by the}} John Innes Institute, and was designed to act as an open collection that would provide access to important resources for ongoing research and breeding. The connection of the Unit and the John Innes Centre has the advantage of placing germplasm material on sites of active research where a higher level of interaction with the scientific community is possible. This two way interaction ensures that scientists and students are exposed to, and have greater opportunities to view and discuss genetic variability, while affording GRU staff active involvement in current research objectives and priorities within both basic and strategic applied science. In 2012 the Unit became a National Capability supported by the BBSRC as part of its new funding arrangmements.Today, the cereal collections have been successfully screened for many traits leading to the identification of new sources of disease resistance to a range of diseases as well as tolerance to drought, salinity and aluminium.|$|E
40|$|Ever {{since the}} first {{developments}} in plant transformation technology using model plant species in the early 1980 s, {{there has been a}} body of plant science research devoted to adapting these techniques to the transformation of crop plants. For some crop species progress was relatively rapid, but in other crop groups such as the <b>small</b> <b>grain</b> <b>cereals,</b> which were not readily amenable to culture in vitro and were not natural hosts to Agrobacterium, it has taken nearly two decades to develop reliable and robust transformation methods. In the following chapters of this book, transformation procedures for <b>small</b> <b>grain</b> <b>cereals</b> are presented, together with methods for gene and protein expression and the characterization of transgenic plants.

40|$|Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a {{mycotoxin}} {{produced by}} the plant pathogenic fungi Fusarium graminearum and F. culmorum. These and other closely related fungi cause a disease known as Fusarium head blight (FHB) in <b>small</b> <b>grain</b> <b>cereals.</b> Other mycotoxins produced by FHB-causing fungi include nivalenol, T- 2 toxin, and zearalenone.

The data was obtained from systematic literature searches conducted to identify publications on <b>small</b> <b>grain</b> <b>cereals</b> and to identify additional publications on the crops covered by the previous database (maize, beet, potato, oilseed rape, rice, cotton, soy). The final database contains information on more than 4000 arthropod species, > 27700 records, and > 2000 references. The database consists of three tables containing information on species (taxonomy, ecological function, feeding guild, habitat), abundances (crop, collection method, location, sampling duration, collected species), and references (authors, year, title, source). Taxonomy was verified with European and global taxonomic catalogues and taxonomic experts. Ecological information, in particular feeding guilds of adults and juveniles, was double checked with appropriate literature, and provided in detail. References for taxonomic and ecological information were included for each species record For maize, beet, potato, oilseed rape, rice, and soybean, 258 additional studies were found and entered into the database, resulting in 2774 additional records. For those crops, the updated database contains 16610 records of 3264 species. Most of the records are available for maize (6648), followed by beet, potato, and oilseed rape (ca. 3000 records each). Relatively few records are available for rice (601), soy (231), and cotton (184). Overall, <b>small</b> <b>grain</b> <b>cereals</b> in Europe were reported to harbour more than 2000 arthropod species. Most information is available for wheat (7626 records and 1664 species), followed by barley (2308 records and 893 species).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Plant {{height is}} a prime example of a dynamic trait that changes {{constantly}} throughout adult development. In this study we utilised a large triticale mapping population, comprising 647 doubled haploid lines derived from 4 families, to phenotype for plant height by a precision phenotyping platform at multiple time points. RESULTS: Using multiple-line cross QTL mapping we identified main effect and epistatic QTL for plant height for each of the time points. Interestingly, some QTL were detected at all time points whereas others were specific to particular developmental stages. Furthermore, the contribution of the QTL to the genotypic variance of plant height also varied with time as exemplified by a major QTL identified on chromosome 6 A.

40|$|Increasing {{concerns}} about pesticide use and a steadily increasing conversion to organic farming have been major factors driving research in physical and cultural weed control methods in Europe. This paper reviews {{some of the}} major results achieved with non-chemical methods and strategies especially adapted for row crops (e. g. corn, sugar beet, onion, leek, and carrot) and <b>small</b> <b>grain</b> <b>cereals</b> (e. g. barley and wheat). In row crops, intra-row weeds constitute a major challenge and research has mainly aimed at replacing laborious hand weeding with mechanization. A number of investigations have focussed on optimising the use of thermal and mechanical weeding methods against intra-row weeds, such as flaming, harrowing, brush weeding, hoeing, torsion weeding and finger weeding. And new methods are now under investigation such as robotic weeding for row crops with abundant spacing between individual plants and band-steaming for row crops developing dense crop stands. The strategic use of mechanical weed control methods in <b>small</b> <b>grain</b> <b>cereals</b> has been another area of considerable interest. Weed harrowing and inter-row hoeing provide promising results when {{they are part of a}} strategy that also involves cultural methods such as fertiliser placement, variety choice, crop seed vigour, and crop seeding rate. Positive interactions between preventive and cultural factors and direct physical methods have been less pronounced in row crops. Although research in preventive, cultural, and physical methods have improved weed control in row crops and <b>small</b> <b>grain</b> <b>cereals,</b> effective long-term weed management in low-external input and organic systems can only be achieved by tackling the problem in a wider context, i. e. at the cropping system level.

40|$|Barley, a <b>small</b> <b>grain</b> <b>cereal,</b> is principally {{used in the}} US in malting and brewing. Malting barley is {{the basic}} {{ingredient}} for beer. Barley is also used as a feed grain. The malting process, during which barley grain is soaked in water to stimulate germination, produces enzymes in the grain which convert its starch, cellulose and proteins into sugar which {{are used in the}} fermentation process.

40|$|Background: Acetyl-CoA {{carboxylase}} (ACCase) inhibiting herbicides {{are important}} {{products for the}} post-emergence control of grass weed species in <b>small</b> <b>grain</b> <b>cereal</b> crops. However, the appearance of resistance to ACCase herbicides over time has resulted in limited options for effective weed control of key species such as Lolium spp. In this study, we have used an integrated biological and molecular biology approach to investigate the mechanism of resistance to ACCase herbicides in a Lolium multiflorum Lam. from the UK (UK 21). Methodology/Principal Findings: The study revealed a novel tryptophan to serine mutation at ACCase codon position 1999 impacting on ACCase inhibiting herbicides to varying degrees. The W 1999 S mutation confers dominant resistance to pinoxaden and partially recessive resistance to cycloxydim and sethoxydim. On the other hand, plants containing the W 1999 S mutation were sensitive to clethodim and tepraloxydim. Additionally population UK 21 is characterised by other resistance mechanisms, very likely non non-target site based, affecting several aryloxyphenoxyproprionate (FOP) herbicides but not the practical field rate of pinoxaden. The positive identification of wild type tryptophan and mutant serine alleles at ACCase position 1999 could be readily achieved with an original DNA based derived cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (dCAPS) assay that uses the same PCR product but two different enzymes for positively identifying the wild type tryptophan and mutant serine alleles identified here...|$|R

After reading the Handbook, however, I have concluded that two major features may make it one of my top two references in this area. Foremost is its outstanding gallery of, full-color pictures.

The excellent photographs of fungal spores, for example, will be particularly helpful to anyone trying to identify those pathogens with a microscope. The second thing that excites me about this little book is its logical, no nonsense arrangement of information. There are the usual table of contents and index, but also a general introduction about plant diseases and a surprisingly useful glossary.

This version was first published at [URL], Doi: 10. 1093 /jxb/erq 309. Grain development and its evolution in grasses remains poorly understood, despite cereals being our most important source of food. The grain, for which many grass species have been domesticated, is a single-seeded fruit with prominent and persistent endosperm. Brachypodium distachyon, a small wild grass, is being posited as a new model system for the temperate <b>small</b> <b>grain</b> <b>cereals,</b> but {{little is known about}} its endosperm development and how this compares with that of the domesticated cereals. A cellular and molecular map of domains within the developing Brachypodium endosperm is constructed. This provides the first detailed description of grain development in Brachypodium for the reference strain, Bd 21, that will be useful for future genetic and comparative studies. Development of Brachypodium grains is compared with that of wheat. Notably, the aleurone is not regionally differentiated as in wheat, suggesting that the modified aleurone region may be a feature of only a subset of cereals. Also, the central endosperm and the nucellar epidermis contain unusually prominent cell walls that may act as a storage material. The composition of these cell walls is more closely related to those of barley and oats than to those of wheat. Therefore, although endosperm development is broadly similar to that of temperate <b>small</b> <b>grain</b> <b>cereals,</b> there are significant differences that may reflect its phylogenetic position between the Triticeae and rice...|$|E
40|$|Several Fusarium species {{occurring}} worldwide on ce-reals as causal {{agents of}} ‘head blight ’ (scab) of <b>small</b> <b>grain</b> <b>cereals</b> and ‘ear rot ’ of maize, {{are capable of}} accu-mulating, in infected kernels, several mycotoxins some of which of notable impact to human and animal health. The main groups of Fusarium toxins commonly recog-nized in grains are: trichothecenes, including T- 2 toxin (T 2), diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS), deoxynivalenol (DON), fusarenone X (FUS), and nivalenol (NIV); zearalenones, essentially zearalenone (ZEN); and fumonisins, in par-ticular fumonisin B 1 (FB 1). In addition, moniliformin (MON), beauvericin (BEA), and fusaproliferin (FUP) were also found in Fusarium infected cereal ears, impor-tant as problems due to them are coming to light. The most frequently encountered mycotoxins in ear blight of wheat and other <b>small</b> <b>grain</b> <b>cereals</b> in Europe, proved to be DON and ZEN, produced by F. graminearum and F. culmorum, occurring from southern (warm) to north-ern (cold) European areas, respectively. In association with DON, NIV and FUS were found formed, in all climes by F. graminearum, F. crookwellense, F. culmo-rum and, in Nordic areas, also by F. poae. Moreover, in central to northeastern European countries, MON pro-duced by F. avenaceum, and T- 2 and DAS produced by F. sporotrichioides and F. poae, were found respectively. In maize red ear rot affected by F. graminearum ZEN, DON, NIV and FUS were found. In addition, the pres-ence of F. avenaceum and F. subglutinans usually led to the accumulation of MON. Moreover, NIV and FUS were found associated with F. crookwellense, and DAS and T- 2 with F. poae and F. sporotrichioides. In maize pink and random kernel rot caused by F. moniliforme, there is increasing evidence of the occurrence of FB 1, es-pecially in southern European areas where the same fusariosis was reinforced by the wide occurrence of F. proliferatum capable of producing FB 1, MON, BEA an...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Frost is an {{important}} abiotic stress that limits cereal production in the temperate zone. As the most frost tolerant <b>small</b> <b>grain</b> <b>cereal,</b> rye (Secale cereale L.) is an ideal cereal model for investigating the genetic basis of frost tolerance (FT), a complex trait with polygenic inheritance. Using 201 genotypes from five Eastern and Middle European winter rye populations, this study reports a multi-platform candidate gene-based association analysis in rye using 161 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and nine insertion-deletion (Indel) polymorphisms previously identified from twelve candidate genes with a putative role in the frost responsive network. Results Phenotypic data analyses of FT in three different phenotyping platforms, controlled, semi-controlled and field, revealed significant genetic variations in the plant material under study. Statistically significant (P ScCbf 15 and one in ScCbf 12, all leading to amino acid exchanges, {{were significantly associated with}} FT over all three phenotyping platforms. Distribution of SNP effect sizes expressed as percentage of the genetic variance explained by individual SNPs was highly skewed towards zero with a few SNPs obtaining large effects. Two-way epistasis was found between 14 pairs of candidate genes. Relatively low to medium empirical correlations of SNP-FT associations were observed across the three platforms underlining the need for multi-level experimentation for dissecting complex associations between genotypes and FT in rye. Conclusions Candidate gene based-association studies are a powerful tool for investigating the genetic basis of FT in rye. Results of this study support the findings of bi-parental linkage mapping and expression studies that the Cbf gene family plays an essential role in FT. </p...|$|R
40|$|Acetyl-CoA {{carboxylase}} (ACCase) inhibiting herbicides {{are important}} {{products for the}} post-emergence control of grass weed species in <b>small</b> <b>grain</b> <b>cereal</b> crops. However, the appearance of resistance to ACCase herbicides over time has resulted in limited options for effective weed control of key species such as Lolium spp. In this study, we have used an integrated biological and molecular biology approach to investigate the mechanism of resistance to ACCase herbicides in a Lolium multiflorum Lam. from the UK (UK 21). The study revealed a novel tryptophan to serine mutation at ACCase codon position 1999 impacting on ACCase inhibiting herbicides to varying degrees. The W 1999 S mutation confers dominant resistance to pinoxaden and partially recessive resistance to cycloxydim and sethoxydim. On the other hand, plants containing the W 1999 S mutation were sensitive to clethodim and tepraloxydim. Additionally population UK 21 is characterised by other resistance mechanisms, very likely non non-target site based, affecting several aryloxyphenoxyproprionate (FOP) herbicides but not the practical field rate of pinoxaden. The positive identification of wild type tryptophan and mutant serine alleles at ACCase position 1999 could be readily achieved with an original DNA based derived cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (dCAPS) assay that uses the same PCR product but two different enzymes for positively identifying the wild type tryptophan and mutant serine alleles identified here. This paper highlights intrinsic differences between ACCase inhibiting herbicides that could be exploited for controlling ryegrass populations such as UK 21 characterised by compound-specific target site and non-target site resistance...|$|R
