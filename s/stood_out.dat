5|$|Cleveland's success {{continued}} in the NFL in 1950, silencing skeptics who thought the team <b>stood</b> <b>out</b> {{only because of the}} poor quality of competition in the AAFC.

They also had a significant influence on artists such as Bryan Lee O'Malley and his Scott Pilgrim series. Due to differing social norms, the content of these comics are sometimes censored or ran afoul of Canadian customs officials. Incidental nudity could be interpreted by them as child pornography and result in jail terms.|$|E

5|$|Whether it {{involved}} {{the history of}} the number zero or the invention of the transistor, two things <b>stood</b> <b>out</b> to me.

I wanted to see a story play out that was more in line with the way real innovation takes place than I had seen on film before.|$|E

Guido defeated Cielo repeatedly in freestyle, while Cielo won the backstroke events.

At age 15, Cielo attended a series of trainings in Florida, USA, and returned home, willing to defeat Guido. When Cielo and Guido were reunited in a 100m freestyle contest, Guido fell behind and lost. From then on, Guido focused on backstroke, reversing positions with Cielo.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{qualified}} {{nature of}} this comment, the operation Beatty had in mind was both important and potentially dangerous. On 6 February 1918, Battleship Division Nine <b>stood</b> <b>out</b> of Scapa Flow to guard the high value Scandinavian Convoy to and from Norway. Twice in the previous year, this convoy—with its essential cargos of iron ore, nitrates, and other chemicals—had been raided by German cruisers and destroyers, {{with the loss of}} 15 allied freighters. To avoid a repeat of these attacks, the British had taken to escorting the convoys with dreadnought squadrons. Still, the possibility existed that the Germans would send out their entire fleet to cut off and annihilate the overmatched battleship squadron, with severe strategic effect.|$|E
