In addition to standard answering machine functions, the VMC features programmable outgoing message selection, message routing, response to caller's touch tone signals, and remote programming ability. The VMC will answer incoming telephone calls, deliver outgoing messages which are Programmably selectable from as many as 16 digitized audio messages stored on the PC's hard disk, record incoming messages to the hard disk or optionally to an external tape recorder, route messages to a specified receiver, respond to a caller's touch tone signals, and enter a remote programming mode {{as a result of}} a special code sent by the caller. Audio messages are processed digitally via A/D and D/A converters which receive and send 8 -bit data to and from the IBM PC through a selectable port address. The A/D conversion is implemented with the ADC 0802 which is operated at a clock rate of 512 kHz. The D/A conversion is implemented with the DAC 0830.

It was laid between Gallanach Bay, near Oban, Scotland and Clarenville, Newfoundland between 1955 and 1956 by the cable ship Monarch. It was inaugurated on September 25, 1956, initially carrying 36 telephone channels. In the first 24 hours of public service there were 588 London-U.S. calls and 119 from London to Canada. The capacity of the cable was soon increased to 48 channels. Later, an additional three channels were added by use of C Carrier equipment.

40|$|Neuroimaging and {{transcranial}} magnetic stimulation provide {{insights into}} the neuronal mechanisms underlying speech disfluencies in chronic persistent stuttering. In the present paper, the {{goal is not to}} provide an exhaustive review of existing literature, but rather to highlight robust findings. We, therefore, conducted a meta-analysis of diffusion tensor imaging studies which have recently implicated disrupted white matter connectivity in stuttering. A reduction of fractional anisotropy in persistent stuttering has been reported at several different loci. Our meta-analysis revealed consistent deficits in the left dorsal stream and in the interhemispheric connections between the sensorimotor cortices. In addition, recent fMRI meta-analyses link stuttering to reduced left fronto-parieto-temporal activation while greater fluency is associated with boosted co-activations of right fronto-parieto-temporal areas. However, the physiological foundation of these irregularities is not accessible with MRI. Complementary, {{transcranial magnetic stimulation}} (TMS) reveals local excitatory and inhibitory regulation of cortical dynamics. Applied to a speech motor area, TMS revealed reduced speech-planning-related neuronal dynamics {{at the level of the}} primary motor cortex in stuttering.
