40|$|To {{test the}} {{reproducibility}} and time effectiveness of two immunoquantitation and sampling methods in Barrett's esophagus (BE) mucosa. Measurements were performed using image cytometry (CAS 200 / 486) with "at convenience" sampling and stereology (QPRODIT 5. 2) with both at convenience and <b>systematic</b> <b>random</b> <b>sampling.</b> Quantitation of p 53 immunohistochemistry (IHC) by CAS was very reproducible {{by the same}} observer (r =. 99), but its interobserver reproducibility was lower, and the measurement was time consuming (r =. 81, 35 minutes). Moreover, CAS also detected a "signal" {{in the absence of}} any visually observable brown stain, giving false positive results. Both intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility by QPRODIT 5. 2 were good. With QPRODIT, using <b>systematic</b> <b>random</b> <b>sampling,</b> the measurements were more reproducible by different observers and faster (r =. 96, 10 minutes) than with QPRODIT with at convenience sampling (r =. 91, 20 minutes). Therefore, for assessment of the Ki- 67 labelling index (LI) and area percentage (area%) of Ki- 67 -positive nuclei, we used only QPRODIT with <b>systematic</b> <b>random</b> <b>sampling.</b> While intraobserver reproducibility of both Ki- 67 LI and area% was good (r =. 96, r =. 99), interobserver reproducibility of Ki- 67 LI was poorer than area% (r =. 72 vs. r =. 97). The assessment of Ki- 67 LI was time consuming, whereas the measurement of the area% of Ki- 67 -positive nuclei was very time effective (45 vs. 7 minutes). A strong correlation was found between Ki- 67 LI and area% of Ki- 67 -positive nuclei (r =. 92).
