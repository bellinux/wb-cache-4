25|$|The modern {{names of}} all seven {{satellites}} of Saturn come from John Herschel (son of William Herschel, discoverer of Mimas and Enceladus).

25|$|In 1842 the Macfarlane mills went under, {{engulfed by}} {{the rising tide}} of technology-driven {{competition}} between Scottish millowners. The Macfarlanes are utterly ruined. Helen and her <b>sisters</b> <b>and</b> <b>brothers</b> had to sign away everything, including their mills and their fine house at 5 Royal Crescent, Glasgow. In Helen's case the prospect of a genteel marriage perhaps to a rising young lawyer or the son of a good merchant was gone and she had to take employment as a governess.|$|E
25|$|Khalid was {{described}} as warm and cheerful and adored by his <b>sisters</b> <b>and</b> <b>brothers,</b> and as attentive and devout. Falconry and horse-riding were Khalid's favorite pastimes, leading to the description {{of him as a}} man of the desert. He bought the first Toyota Landcruiser in 1955 for falconry. In December 1975 Khalid bought the then longest Cadillac at 25 feet and 2 inches long. Khalid bought Beechwood House in the north London suburb of Highgate for £1.9 million in March 1977.|$|E

25|$|Most runestones {{were raised}} by men and only one runestone in eight is raised by a single woman, while at least 10% are raised by a woman {{together}} with several men. It is common that the runestones {{were raised by}} sons and widows of the deceased, but they could also be raised by <b>sisters</b> <b>and</b> <b>brothers.</b> It is almost only in Uppland, Södermanland, and Öland that women raised runestones together with male relatives. It is not known why many people such as sisters, brothers, uncles, parents, housecarls, and business partners can be enumerated on runestones, {{but it is possible}} that it is because {{they are part of the}} inheritors.|$|E
25|$|Tharavadu is {{a system}} of joint family practised by Malayalis, {{especially}} castes Nairs, Ezhava, Thiyyas and other prominent religious groups. Each Tharavadu has a unique name. The Tharavadu was administered by the Karanavar, the oldest male member of the family. He would be the eldest maternal uncle of the family as well. The members of the Tharavadu consisted of mother, daughters, sons, <b>sisters</b> <b>and</b> <b>brothers.</b> The fathers and husbands had very minimal {{role to play in}} the affairs of the Tharavadu. It was a true matrilineal affair. The Karanavar took all major decisions. He was usually autocratic. However, the consent of the eldest female member of the family was taken before implementing the decisions. This eldest female member would be his maternal grandmother, own mother, mother's sister, his own sister or a sister through his maternal lineage. Since the lineage was through the female members, the birth of a daughter was always welcomed. Each Tharavadu also has a Para Devatha (clan deity) revered by those in the particular Tharavadu. Temples were built to honor these deities.|$|E

The Ministry approved a $90,000 project support for the Church of Norway, while the pressure group Bellona faced a cut of the same amount. Hareide, being a devout Christian {{and a member of}} the Church of Norway, was accused of putting his own religious interests ahead of environmental considerations. The case became a curiosity in the Norwegian media as some of the money was channelled into the church internet site, which, among other things, contained a set of prayers for earthworms – described in such odd terms as [...] "the blind subterranean workers", [...] "small <b>sisters</b> <b>and</b> <b>brothers</b> in the compost" [...] and [...] "members of the subterranean congregation". Hareide responded to the criticism by describing the overall project as [...] "exciting".|$|E

When asked why his name is Captain, Munnerlyn said, [...] "My momma promised my grandmomma that she could name the last child. I was the boy of the family, and she named me Captain. Her great grandfather was named Captain, so I got named after my great-great grandfather. My <b>sisters</b> <b>and</b> <b>brothers</b> have normal names. I got the odd name.

[...] Munnerlyn majored in criminal justice while at South Carolina, where he was teammates and roommates with former Viking linebacker Jasper Brinkley.

500|$|Attendance at Gay Pride marches {{during the}} summer of 1978 in Los Angeles and San Francisco swelled. An {{estimated}} 250,000 to 375,000 attended San Francisco's Gay Freedom Day Parade; newspapers claimed the higher numbers were due to John Briggs. Organizers asked participants to carry signs indicating their hometowns for the cameras, to show how far people came to live in the Castro District. Milk rode in an open car carrying a sign saying [...] "I'm from Woodmere, N.Y."

2500|$|Hazel was the 15-year-old {{daughter}} of William Albert Miner, a farmer, and his wife, the former Blanche Steele, both originally of Iowa.

2500|$|As {{children}} in West Oakland, the Pointer <b>sisters</b> <b>and</b> <b>brothers</b> {{were encouraged to}} listen to and sing gospel music by their parents Reverend Elton Pointer and Sarah Pointer.

When June, the youngest sister, brought home a copy of the Elvis Presley record All Shook Up, she was surprised that her mother allowed her to play it, until discovering that her mother had been pacified by the song [...] "Crying in the Chapel" [...] on the [...] "B" [...] side of the record.|$|E

2500|$|In 2002, when {{delivering}} a public lecture {{in support of}} divestment, Tutu said [...] "My heart aches. I say why are our memories so short. Have our Jewish <b>sisters</b> <b>and</b> <b>brothers</b> forgotten their humiliation? Have they forgotten the collective punishment, the home demolitions, in their own history so soon? Have they {{turned their backs on}} their profound and noble religious traditions? Have they forgotten that God cares deeply about the downtrodden?" [...] He argued that Israel could never live in security by oppressing another people, and stated, [...] "People are scared in this country , to say wrong is wrong because the Jewish lobby is powerful – very powerful. Well, so what? For goodness sake, this is God's world! We live in a moral universe. The apartheid government was very powerful, but today it no longer exists." [...] The latter statement was criticised by some Jewish groups, including the Anti-Defamation League. When he edited and reprinted parts of his speech in 2005, Tutu replaced the words [...] "Jewish lobby" [...] with [...] "pro-Israel lobby".|$|E
2500|$|For modern Disciples the one {{essential}} is {{the acceptance}} of Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, and obedience to him in baptism. There is no requirement to give assent to any other statement of belief or creed. Nor is there any [...] "official" [...] interpretation of the Bible. Hierarchical doctrine was traditionally rejected by Disciples as human-made and divisive, and subsequently, freedom of belief and scriptural interpretation allows many Disciples to question or even deny beliefs common in doctrinal churches such as the Incarnation, the Trinity, and the Atonement. Beyond the essential commitment to follow Jesus {{there is a tremendous}} freedom of belief and interpretation. As the basic teachings of Jesus are studied and applied to life, there is the freedom to interpret Jesus' teaching in different ways. As would be expected from such an approach, there is a wide diversity among Disciples in what individuals and congregations believe. It is not uncommon to find individuals who seemingly hold diametrically opposed beliefs within the same congregation affirming one another's journeys of faith as <b>sisters</b> <b>and</b> <b>brothers</b> in Christ.|$|E
