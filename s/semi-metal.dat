"Matters being thus arranged, I contrived, by {{the aid of}} my {{wife and}} with the {{greatest}} secrecy and caution, to dispose of what property I had remaining, and to borrow, in small sums, under various pretences, and without paying any attention to my future means of repayment, no inconsiderable quantity of ready money. With the means thus accruing I proceeded to procure at intervals, cambric muslin, very fine, in pieces of twelve yards each; twine; {{a lot of the}} varnish of caoutchouc; a large and deep basket of wicker-work, made to order; and several other articles necessary in the construction and equipment of a balloon of extraordinary dimensions. This I directed my wife to make up as soon as possible, and gave her all requisite information as to the particular method of proceeding. In the meantime I worked up the twine into a net-work of sufficient dimensions; rigged it with a hoop and the necessary cords; bought a quadrant, a compass, a spy-glass, a common barometer with some important modifications, and two astronomical instruments not so generally known. I then took opportunities of conveying by night, to a retired situation east of Rotterdam, five iron-bound casks, to contain about fifty gallons each, and one of a larger size; six tinned ware tubes, three inches in diameter, properly shaped, and ten feet in length; a quantity of a particular metallic substance, or <b>semi-metal,</b> which I shall not name, and a dozen demijohns of a very common acid. The gas to be formed from these latter materials is a gas never yet generated by any other person than myself--or at least never applied to any similar purpose. The secret I would make no difficulty in disclosing, but that it of right belongs to a citizen of Nantz, in France, by whom it was conditionally communicated to myself. The same individual submitted to me, without being at all aware of my intentions, a method of constructing balloons from the membrane of a certain animal, through which substance any escape of gas was nearly an impossibility. I found it, however, altogether too expensive, and was not sure, upon the whole, whether cambric muslin with a coating of gum caoutchouc, was not equally as good. I mention this circumstance, because I think it probable that hereafter the individual in question may attempt a balloon ascension with the novel gas and material I have spoken of, and I do not wish to deprive him of the honor of a very singular invention.|$|E

5000|$|Since {{graphene}} has extremely weak spin-orbit coupling, it is {{very unlikely}} to support a quantum spin Hall state at temperatures achievable with today's technologies. A very realistic theoretical proposal {{for the existence of}} the quantum spin Hall state has been put forward in 1987 by Pankratov, Pakhomov and Volkov in Cadmium Telluride/Mercury Telluride/Cadmium Telluride (CdTe/HgTe/CdTe) quantum wells in which a thin (5-7 nanometers) sheet of HgTe is sandwiched between two sheets of CdTe, [...] and subsequently experimentally realized [...] (In fact, the proposed quantum wells do not exhibit the quantum spin Hall effect and do not demonstrate the existence of the quantum spin Hall state. It should be regarded as topological insulators. So far quantum spin Hall effect has not been observed in experiments.)Different quantum wells of varying HgTe thickness can be built. When the sheet of HgTe in between the CdTe is thin, the system behaves like an ordinary insulator and does not conduct when the Fermi level resides in the band-gap. When the sheet of HgTe is varied and made thicker (this requires the fabrication of separate quantum wells), an interesting phenomenon happens. Due to the inverted band structure of HgTe, at some critical HgTe thickness, a Lifshitz transition occurs in which the system closes the bulk band gap to become a <b>semi-metal,</b> and then re-opens it to become a quantum spin Hall insulator.|$|E
40|$|Based on some {{theoretical}} arguments, it {{has been}} suggested that electromagnetic response of 3 D Weyl <b>semi-metals</b> with non-zero chiral- chemical potential may have a Chern-Simons term, 1 / 2 k_μϵ^μνρσF_νρA_σ, in their effective action for the gauge field. An independent numerical study has shown that such a term is absent in a similar system. In this paper, we investigate the non-equilibrium and equilibrium response of 3 D Weyl <b>semi-metals.</b> We argue that the controversy in literature stems from the difference in response of these two distinct states. We then develop a method to deal with well-known ambiguities in quantum electrodynamics in 3 D (QED_ 3 + 1) with non-zero chiral-chemical potential and calculate the Chern-Simons term unambiguously. We find that time-like Chern-Simons term can exist in non-equilibrium conditions. We observe that there does not exist any chiral-magnetic effect in equilibrium and anomalous Hall effect replaces it.
