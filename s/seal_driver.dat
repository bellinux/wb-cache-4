50|$|Surging is the {{complete}} breakdown of steady {{flow in the}} compressor which occurs at low flow rate. Surging takes place when compressor is operated off the design point and it affects the whole machine and this is aerodynamically and mechanically undesirable. It can damage the rotor bearings, rotor <b>seals,</b> compressor <b>driver</b> and affect the whole cycle operation. It results in high temperature, high vibration and leads to flow reversal.|$|R

500|$|The RAIB {{investigation}} into the accident reported that the outward working, reporting number 1Z21, the 07:22 from [...] to , had been fitted with a numbered plastic tie on {{the handle of the}} Automatic Warning System (AWS) isolating cock. The train was driven to Bristol without incident, although some misting of the driver's window was reported. The driver of that train was not the driver later involved in the SPAD at Wootton Bassett. During an empty coaching stock movement to St Philip's Marsh depot, the emergency brake applied because the driver did not cancel an AWS warning in the allotted time. The AWS isolating cock was opened, breaking the seal. On leaving St Philip's Marsh, a similar incident occurred, and the AWS isolating cock was opened again. There was a change of traincrew on arrival at Bristol Temple Meads, where the return working was designated 1Z67. According to the rulebook, the driver of the train should have reported the missing seal on the AWS isolating cock. The train should not have been allowed to depart until the cock had been <b>sealed.</b> The <b>driver</b> did not do this, and set off with an unsealed cock.|$|R

50|$|Military wheeled vehicles, {{such as a}} HEMTT {{transport}} or a Unimog {{are often}} capable of mounting snorkels for the engine air intake only, {{to allow them to}} wade through relatively deep water, limited by the height of snorkel intake and the driver's head (usually slightly less than the height of the roof). Generally, the crew compartment is not watertight, and the crew will be immersed, unlike in tracked vehicles, which are generally totally sealed. The maximum depth is dictated by the height of the snorkel; if the water level should reach the snorkel intake, it will be drawn into the engine, immediately killing it. In the case of a World War II-era amphibious Jeep, all of the engine openings and electrical wiring are <b>sealed,</b> and the <b>driver</b> must first operate a damper that prevents water from entering the intake manifold. After fording, all vehicles wheel bearings must be repacked with new lubricants due to water contamination. Modern military vehicles typically come from the factory with waterproofed wiring systems.|$|R
5000|$|Due {{to safety}} concerns, {{especially}} by Helmut Marko, {{who called the}} race [...] "totally insane", the last Targa Florio as a World Sportscar Championship race was run in 1973; where during this event it became impossible to retain its international status {{after a number of}} horrendous and 2 fatal accidents at the event; one which privateer Charles Blyth crashed his Lancia Fulvia HF into a trailer {{at the end of the}} Buonfornello straight and was killed; and another where an Italian driver crashed his Alpine-Renault into a group of spectators, killing one. There were several other accidents during practice for the 1973 event in which a total of seven spectators sustained injuries. In that year, even a Porsche 911 won as the prototypes such as Jacky Ickx's Ferrari suffered crashes or other troubles. Another reason for the Targa's international demise was because international automotive governing body, the FIA, mandated safety walls on all circuits that were going to hold FIA-mandated events; and the 44 mi length of combined public roads made this simply impossible and totally impractical, especially from a financial standpoint. The Targa was continued as a national event for some years, before a crash in 1977 which killed 2 spectators and seriously injured 5 others (including the <b>driver)</b> <b>sealed</b> its fate. The 1977 race was forcibly taken over by local police and was stopped on the 4th lap, and it also saw 2 other drivers having serious accidents; one of them was critically injured, but survived.|$|R
5000|$|Neon Genesis Evangelion is a Japanese {{science fiction}} {{animation}} series {{created by the}} anime studio Gainax and was both directed and written by Hideaki Anno. Existential themes of individuality, consciousness, freedom, choice, and responsibility are heavily relied upon throughout the entire series, particularly through the philosophies of Jean-Paul Sartre and Søren Kierkegaard. Episode 16's title, [...] "The Sickness Unto Death, And…" [...] (Shi ni itaru yamai, soshite) is a reference to Kierkegaard's book, The Sickness Unto Death. Some contemporary films dealing with existentialist issues include Fight Club, I ♥ Huckabees, Waking Life, The Matrix, Ordinary People, and Life in a Day. Likewise, films throughout the 20th century such as The Seventh <b>Seal,</b> Ikiru, Taxi <b>Driver,</b> the Toy Story films, The Great Silence, Ghost in the Shell, Harold and Maude, High Noon, Easy Rider, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, A Clockwork Orange, Groundhog Day, Apocalypse Now, Badlands, and Blade Runner also have existentialist qualities. Notable directors known for their existentialist films include Ingmar Bergman, François Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Michelangelo Antonioni, Akira Kurosawa, Terrence Malick, Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky, Hideaki Anno, Wes Anderson, Woody Allen, and Christopher Nolan. Charlie Kaufman's Synecdoche, New York focuses on the protagonist's desire to find existential meaning. Similarly, in Kurosawa's Red Beard, the protagonist's experiences as an intern in a rural health clinic in Japan lead him to an existential crisis whereby he questions his reason for being. This, in turn, leads him {{to a better understanding}} of humanity. The French film, Mood Indigo (directed by Michel Gondry) embraced various elements of existentialism. The film The Shawshank Redemption, released in 1994, depicts life in a prison in Maine, United States to explore several existentialist concepts.|$|R
50|$|As part of {{the link}} up with Craft Racing {{at the start of}} 2014, Craft Bamboo took over the entry of two GT3 Aston Martin Vantages in the GT Asia Championship, a highly {{regarded}} continental series where the team received technical back from Aston Martin Racing. The #97 car was driven all year by longtime Craft driver Frank Yu and was partnered by Australian V8 Supercar driver Warren Luff, Aston Martin Racing works driver Stefan Mucke and experienced GT racer Richard Lyons. The #99 car was shared through the season by several drivers with Jonathan Venter spending 3 weekends in the car.After taking solid points in the opening round in Korea, the #97 driven by Lyons & Yu took pole position at the second race in Autopolis, Japan. They failed to take the win but still finished strongly in second place. The breakthrough win did come at round 7 in the teams home race in Malaysia with Mucke this time partnering Yu. The only win of the season. Solid results meant Yu was still in title contention heading into the final race at Macau but couldn't do enough to secure the title and ended up 7th in the standings. A DQ at round 4 in Autopolis and a DNF's at the following face at Fuji and another at round 9 in Malaysia ultimately costing him and the team. The team however did enough to finish second in the teams championship. For 2015 Craft Bamboo announced the two Aston Martin Vantages would return for the season, both staffed with full-time drivers. Frank Yu would continue and partnered full-time with Richard Lyons, and in the #99 car Jonathon Venter secured a full-time drive with backing from Aston Martin and will partner former Manufacturer driver Darryl O'Young. The first round in Korea saw the #88 car of Lyons secure pole position and go on to take a third place. The spoils were shared out in the second race at O'Young and Venter in the #99 Aston Martin took an impressive race victory.During the summer Venter broke his leg in a cycling accident at home in Australia, and Brit Daniel Lloyd was drafted in to replace him in the #99 Aston. Lloyd took a podium on his opening weekend with O'Young in the 12 hours of Sepang race, and followed up with a double victory in Shanghai to allow the #99 car to take the championship lead with one event remaining. Lloyd took a stunning last gasp victory in Shanghai, after being 5th {{at the end of a}} safety car period with 3 laps remaining completed an overtaking move round the outside of turn 1 to take the lead on the final lap.Qualifying issues in Thailand saw O'Young & Lloyd in the #99 start well down the grid while their main competitors scored a solid result meaning #99 would go into the final race level on points with their Bentley rivals of Song/Sawa, but starting behind them in second on the grid. O'Young <b>sealed</b> the <b>drivers</b> title for craft bamboo racing however with a fine victory.|$|R
