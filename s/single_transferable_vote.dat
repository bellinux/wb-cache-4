5|$|At the 9th Academy Awards {{ceremony}} held in 1937, Gale Sondergaard was {{the first}} winner of this award {{for her role in}} Anthony Adverse.

5|$|McEntee was re-elected to {{represent}} Meath East at the election, held on 26 February. Under the Irish electoral system, which uses the <b>single</b> <b>transferable</b> <b>vote</b> (STV) {{she was one}} of three candidates elected {{to represent}} the constituency, alongside Thomas Byrne for Fianna Fáil, and Regina Doherty for Fine Gael. With 7,556 votes McEntee finished second behind Byrne, who had 10,818 votes. She secured a seat in the Dáil on the eighth count, despite not reaching the 50% quota required under STV rules.|$|E

25|$|Another reason {{presented}} {{was that}} voters were given two papers with two different systems {{and a different}} design – one for the parliamentary election where voters marked a cross and one for local councils where they placed numbers, as the council elections were under the <b>single</b> <b>transferable</b> <b>vote</b> system.

50|$|Proportional {{representation}} {{systems are}} much less susceptible to tactical voting systems than single-winner systems such as the first past the post system and instant-runoff voting (IRV), {{if the number of}} seats to be filled is sufficiently large.

50|$|Because {{gerrymandering}} {{relies on}} the wasted-vote effect, {{the use of a}} different voting system with fewer wasted votes can help reduce gerrymandering. In particular, the use of multi-member districts alongside voting systems establishing proportional representation such as <b>single</b> <b>transferable</b> <b>voting</b> can reduce wasted votes and gerrymandering. Semi-proportional voting systems such as single non-transferable vote or cumulative voting are relatively simple and similar to first past the post and can also reduce the proportion of wasted votes and thus potential gerrymandering. Electoral reformers have advocated all three as replacement systems.|$|R

50|$|The Australian Senate has 76 members.

The Senate is afforded substantial powers by the Australian Constitution, significantly greater than those of Westminster upper houses such as those of the United Kingdom and Canada, and has the power to block legislation originating in the House as well as supply or monetary bills. As such, the Senate has the power to bring down the government, as occurred during the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis.|$|R
40|$|Successive {{elimination}} of candidates {{is often a}} route to making manipulation intractable to compute. We prove that eliminating candidates does not necessarily increase the computational complexity of manipulation. However, for many voting rules used in practice, the computational complexity increases. For example, it is already known that it is NP-hard to compute how a single voter can manipulate the result of <b>single</b> <b>transferable</b> <b>voting</b> (the elimination version of plurality voting). We show here that it is NP-hard to compute how a single voter can manipulate {{the result of the}} elimination version of veto voting, of the closely related Coombs' rule, and of the elimination versions of a general class of scoring rules.

5000|$|The South Australian Legislative Council has 22 members elected {{under the}} {{preferential}} <b>single</b> <b>transferable</b> <b>voting</b> system by group voting tickets. Voters {{can choose to}} vote for a ticket by placing the number '1' in one of the ticket boxes [...] "above the line" [...] or can vote for individual candidates by numbering all the boxes [...] "below the line" [...] (54 in the 2006 election). In above the line voting, ticket votes are distributed according to the party or group voting ticket registered before the election with the election management body. As most ballot papers are above the line, this form of voting often leads to pre-election trading between parties on how each party will allocate later preferences to other parties and candidates.|$|R
