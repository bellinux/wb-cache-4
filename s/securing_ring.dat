40|$|The present {{invention}} {{provides a}} vascular conduit device including a deformable flange and complementary <b>securing</b> <b>ring</b> in cooperation for securing the device within an aperture defined in a tissue wall. The present invention further provides {{a system for}} implanting such a vascular conduit device in a tissue wall. More specifically, the present invention provides a system including a coring device for defining an aperture in a tissue wall (such as a ventricle and/or a blood vessel) and securely implanting a vascular conduit device therein so as to provide fluid communication between a first and second surface of the tissue wall via the vascular conduit device.

40|$|In this paper, {{we suggest}} {{solutions}} to the key exposure problem in ring signature. In particular, we propose the first forward <b>secure</b> <b>ring</b> signature scheme and the first key-insulated ring signature scheme. Both constructions allow a $(t,n) $-threshold setting. That is, even $t$ secret keys are compromised, the validity of all forward <b>secure</b> <b>ring</b> signatures generated {{in the past is}} still preserved. In the other way, the compromise of up to all secret keys does not allow any adversary to generate a valid key-insulated ring signature for the remaining time periods. All our proposed schemes are proven secure in the random oracle model...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a forward <b>secure</b> <b>ring</b> {{signature}} scheme without random oracles. With forward security, if a secret key of a corresponding ring member is exposed, all previously signed signatures containing this member remain valid. Yet {{the one who}} has stolen the secret key cannot produce any valid signature belonged to the past time period. This is especially useful in the case of ring signature, as the exposure of a single secret key may result in the invalidity of thousands or even millions ring signatures which contain that particular user. However, most of the ring signature schemes in the literature do not provide forward security. The only one with this feature [14] relies on random oracles to prove the security. We are the first to construct a forward <b>secure</b> <b>ring</b> signature scheme that can be proven secure without random oracles. Our scheme can be deployed in many applications, such as wireless sensor networks and smart grid system...|$|R

50|$|The U.S. Army's flat ovoid M-1932 wartime-issue mess kit {{was made}} of {{galvanized}} steel (stainless steel in the later M-1942), and was a divided pan-and-body system. When opened, the mess kit consisted of two halves: the deeper half forms a shallow, flat-bottom, ovoid Meat Can Body, designed to receive the Meat Ration, the meat portion of the prewar canned Reserve Ration. The Meat Can Body, with its folding handle extended, can double as a crude skillet. The Mess Kit Plate (lid) is even more shallow, and is pressed to form two compartments, with a center divide wide enough to accommodate the folding handle. The plate also has a very <b>secure</b> <b>ring</b> that is {{held in place by}} friction.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- The {{security}} of a system cannot be certified unless there are formal methods of admission control. Many techniques and protocol have been proposed that try to provide security yet do not focus {{on the most important}} question about who has access to the system. When considering group communications {{it is more important to}} understand this problem as the {{security of}} the system is dependent upon having authorized entities in the group communicating securely. Admission control has previously been studied indistributed systems but repeatedly overlooked in security. In this paper we provide a polling centred admission control system based on ICMetrics. We choose the polling based system as it considers the opinion of current group members when giving access to members wishing to join the group. Our proposed protocol is based on the use of the <b>secure</b> <b>ring</b> signature along with the latest ICMetrics technology...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} herein {{describes the}} first total {{synthesis of the}} complex Daphniphyllum alkaloid, (-) -calyciphylline N. This alkaloid {{was chosen as the}} target in our synthetic program due its unprecedented structure, the inherent challenges associated with its synthesis, and limited reports of synthetic studies towards members of this family of natural products. An initial unsuccessful approach is discussed, followed by a revised, ultimately successful approach. Highlights of the synthesis include a substrate controlled, intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction to build the bicyclo[2. 2. 2]octane core and set four contiguous stereocenters, a transannular enolate alkylation to <b>secure</b> <b>ring</b> D, a highly efficient Stille carbonylation/Nazarov cyclization sequence to construct ring E with concomitant activation of a hindered silyl group towards Fleming-Tamao oxidation, and an unprecedented, homogeneous hydrogenation of an exceptionally hindered diene ester to complete the eastern hemisphere, a structural motif that is common to a variety of the Daphniphyllum alkaloids. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} covers two {{topics of}} interest for network applications: lookup protocols, a basic building block for distributed systems, and ring signatures, a powerful primitive for anonymous communication. In {{the first part of}} this work, we review lookup protocols, distributed algorithms that allow users to publish a document as well as to look up a published document that matches a given name. Our first major contribution is to design Local Minima Search (LMS), a new efficient lookup protocol for a model in which a node is physically connected to a few other nodes and may only communicate directly with them. Our second major contribution is the formulation of a new model in which we allow an arbitrary number of misbehaving nodes, but we assume a restriction on their network addresses. We then design a new lookup protocol for this setting. In the second part of this dissertation, we present our work on ring signatures, a variant of digital signatures, which enables a user to sign a message so that a set of possible signers is identified, without revealing which member of that set actually generated the signature. Our first contribution on this topic is new definitions of security which address attacks not taken into account by previous work. As our second contribution, we design the first provably <b>secure</b> <b>ring</b> signature schemes in the standard model...|$|R
