5|$|Hitler's {{leadership}} style {{was to give}} contradictory orders to <b>subordinates</b> and to place them into positions where their duties and responsibilities overlapped with those of others. In this way, Hitler fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his <b>subordinates</b> to consolidate and maximise his own power. His cabinet never met after 1938, and he discouraged his ministers from meeting independently. Hitler typically did not issue written orders, but gave them orally at meetings or in phone conversations; he also had Bormann convey orders. Bormann used his position to control {{the flow of information}} and access to Hitler, earning him enemies, including Himmler.|$|E

The extent of market discipline of <b>subordinated</b> debt critically depends on its relative magnitude to senior debt and the bankruptcy costs. Under specified conditions, the <b>subordinated</b> debt prices are found to provide additional information about the value of bank assets relative to equity prices.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{empirical}} relationship between subordinate-supervisor demographic and value similarity with <b>subordinate</b> perceptions of organizational justice using three structural equation models. The first model indicated that subordinate-supervisor demographic and value similarity were directly related to <b>subordinate</b> perceptions of organizational justice (Direct Model). The second model indicated that <b>subordinate</b> perceived value similarity with their supervisor mediated the relationship between the subordinate-supervisor demographic similarity and <b>subordinate</b> perceptions of organizational justice (Mediated Model). The last model indicated <b>subordinate</b> perceived value similarity with their supervisor moderated the relationship between subordinate-supervisor demographic similarity and <b>subordinate</b> perceptions of organizational justice (Moderated Model). Neither the mediator nor the moderator models were supported by the data. However, the direct model received partial support when a relationship was found between subordinate-supervisor value similarity and <b>subordinate</b> perceptions of organizational justice across all three organizational justice factors. The results suggest that <b>subordinate</b> perceptions of organizational justice are related to subordinate-supervisor shared values, but not to subordinate-supervisor demographic similarity...|$|R
