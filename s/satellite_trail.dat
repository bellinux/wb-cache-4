5000|$|As Voyager 1 {{approached}} the Jupiter system in March 1979, it acquired numerous {{images of the}} planet and its four largest satellites, including Io. One of the most distinctive features of these distant images of Io was a large, elliptical, footprint-shaped ring on the <b>satellite's</b> <b>trailing</b> hemisphere (the side facing away {{from the direction of}} motion in a synchronously-rotating satellite like Io). [...] During the encounter itself on March 5, 1979, Voyager 1 acquired high-resolution images of the footprint-shaped region. At the center of bow tie-shaped dark region {{in the middle of the}} ring was a depression partially filled with dark material, 30 km by 20 km in size. [...] This depression, later found to be the source of the Pele volcano, is at the northern base of a rifted mountain later named Danube Planum. With the other dramatic evidence for volcanic activity on the surface of Io from this encounter, researchers hypothesized that Pele was likely a caldera.|$|R
40|$|Astronomical {{images from}} optical {{photometric}} surveys are typically contaminated with transient artifacts such as cosmic rays, <b>satellite</b> <b>trails</b> and scattered light. We have developed and tested an algorithm that removes these artifacts using a deep, artifact free, static sky coadd image built {{up through the}} median combination of point spread function (PSF) homogenized, overlapping single epoch images. Transient artifacts are detected and masked in each single epoch image through comparison with an artifact free, PSF-matched simulated image that is constructed using the PSF-corrected, model fitting catalog from the artifact free coadd image together with the position variable PSF model of the single epoch image. This approach works well not only for cleaning single epoch images with worse seeing than the PSF homogenized coadd, but also the traditionally much more challenging problem of cleaning single epoch images with better seeing. In addition to masking transient artifacts, we have developed an interpolation approach that uses the local PSF and performs well in removing artifacts whose widths are smaller than the PSF full width at half maximum, including cosmic rays, the peaks of saturated stars and bleed trails. We have tested this algorithm on Dark Energy Survey Science Verification data and present performance metrics. More generally, our algorithm {{can be applied to}} any survey which images the same part of the sky multiple times. Comment: 17 pages, 6 figures.

40|$|A simple stellar {{population}} (SSP) {{consists of}} stars with uniform age and metallicity formed {{by a single}} short-lived burst of star formation within a cloud of given chemical composition. Globular clusters and elliptical galaxies are good examples. By contrast, a composite stellar population (CSP) is one which contains stars formed at different times with varying initial chemical compositions. Disk galaxies, for instance, contain multiple generations of stars with manifold initial metal enrichments. A CSP is characterized by its star formation history (SFH) which depends on the star formation rate (SFR) and chemical enrichment law (CEL) as functions of time. 2 Why Extract the Star Formation History of a CSP? In general, galaxy evolution proceeds dynamically through interactions, accretions and mergers with other dark matter halos and through the formation and evolution of the stars within them. Galaxy mergers, and interactions with dwarf satellite galaxies, may impact on the local star formation rate or add material as the disrupted <b>satellite</b> <b>trails</b> tidal debris along its orbit. All this information is contained within the CSP of a given field like a fossil record. Retrieving the SFH from the colour magnitude diagram (CMD) of such a population provides the empirical basis upon which robust theories of galaxy formation can be built. Here SFH refers to the star formation rate {{as a function of}} time, SFR(t), and the chemical enrichment law as a function of time, CEL(t). For example, extracting the SFH of composite stellar populations in galactic halo substructure can test the paradigm of hierarchical galaxy formation which predicts a large fraction of stellar halos should be built up by material from accreted sub halos. Alternatively, the SFH of isolated dwarf galaxies could be useful to explore the influence of re-ionisation on galaxy formation at high redshift. 3 The Expected Distribution of Disk Galaxy Stellar Pop-ulations In a rough sense, different kinds of stars are distributed within the parent galaxy ac-cording to its components (thin disk, thick disk, bulge, halo etc.). Figure 1 shows the characteristic ages and metallicities expected of different components. (Here metallicity refers to [Fe/H] by assuming a constant solar heavy metal distribution).

2500|$|The {{surface of}} Tethys {{has a number}} of {{large-scale}} features distinguished by their color and sometimes brightness. The trailing hemisphere gets increasingly red and dark as the anti-apex of motion is approached. This darkening is responsible for the hemispheric albedo asymmetry mentioned above. The leading hemisphere also reddens slightly as the [...] of the motion is approached, although without any noticeable darkening. Such a bifurcated color pattern results in the existence of a bluish band between hemispheres following a great circle that runs through the poles. This coloration and darkening of the Tethyan surface is typical for Saturnian middle-sized satellites. Its origin may be related to a deposition of bright ice particles from the E-ring onto the leading hemispheres and dark particles coming from outer <b>satellites</b> on the <b>trailing</b> hemispheres. The darkening of the trailing hemispheres can also be caused by the impact of plasma from the magnetosphere of Saturn, which co-rotates with the planet.|$|R

5000|$|GRACE is {{the first}} Earth-monitoring mission {{in the history of}} space flight whose key {{measurement}} is not derived from electromagnetic waves either reflected off, emitted by, or transmitted through Earth's surface and/or atmosphere. Instead, the mission uses a microwave ranging system to accurately measure changes in the speed and distance between two identical spacecraft flying in a polar orbit about 220 km apart, 500 km above Earth. The ranging system is sensitive enough to detect separation changes as small as 10 micrometers (approximately one-tenth the width of a human hair) over a distance of 220 kilometers. [...] As the twin GRACE satellites circle the globe 15 times a day, they sense minute variations in Earth's gravitational pull. When the first satellite passes over a region of slightly stronger gravity, a gravity anomaly, it is pulled slightly ahead of the <b>trailing</b> <b>satellite.</b> This causes the distance between the satellites to increase. The first spacecraft then passes the anomaly, and slows down again; meanwhile the following spacecraft accelerates, then decelerates over the same point. By measuring the constantly changing distance between the two satellites and combining that data with precise positioning measurements from Global Positioning System (GPS) instruments, scientists can construct a detailed map of Earth's gravity anomalies.|$|R
40|$|Cassini VIMS has {{obtained}} spatially resolved imaging spectroscopy data on numerous satellites of Saturn. A very close fly-by of Dione provided key information for solving {{the riddle of}} the origin of the dark material in the Saturn system. The Dione VIMS data show a pattern of bombardment of fine, sub- 0. 5 -Î¼m diameter particles impacting the <b>satellite</b> from the <b>trailing</b> side direction. Multiple lines of evidence point to an external origin for the dark material on Dione, including the global spatial pattern of dark material, local patterns including crater and cliff walls shielding implantation on slopes facing away from the trailing side, exposing clean ice, and slopes facing the trailing direction which show higher abundances of dark material. Multiple spectral features of the dark material match those seen on Phoebe, Iapetus, Hyperion, Epimetheus and the F-ring, implying the material has a common composition throughout the Saturn system. However, the exact composition of the dark material remains a mystery, except that bound water and, tentatively, ammonia are detected, and there is evidence both for and against cyanide compounds. Exact identification of composition requires additional laboratory work. A blue scattering peak with a strong UVâ€“visible absorption is observed in spectra of all satellites which contain dark material, and the cause is Rayleigh scattering, again pointing to a common origin. The Rayleigh scattering effect is confirmed with laboratory experiments using ice and 0. 2 -Î¼m diameter carbon grains when the carbon abundance is less than about 2 % by weight. Rayleigh scattering in solids is also confirmed in naturally occurring terrestrial rocks, and in previously published reflectance studies. The spatial pattern, Rayleigh scattering effect, and spectral properties argue that the dark material is only a thin coating on Dione's surface, and by extension is only a thin coating on Phoebe, Hyperion, and Iapetus, although the dark material abundance appears higher on Iapetus, and may be locally thick. As previously concluded for Phoebe, the dark material appears to be external to the Saturn system and may be cometary in origin. We also report a possible detection of material around Dione which may indicate Dione is active and contributes material to the E-ring, but this observation must be confirmed...|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} our Universe spans 13. 7 billions of years and could be divided into several stages from the Big Bang up to now. Around 370 000 years after the Big Bang (z 1100) the {{temperature}} of the Universe low- ered enough for the first simple atoms to form. Matter and radiation decoupled, and the Universe became transparent to radiation. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons that we detect nowadays were last scattered at z 1100 and, since then, have been traveling in straight line. This is the reason why CMB is usually defined as the picture of the Universe at that redshift. Right after the CMB was emitted, the Universe entered the so called Dark Ages when no sources of light exist. Studying the early Universe, {{one of the most important}} phases is the subsequent phase-transition named reionization, i. e. the process that reionized the matter in the Universe after the formation of the first sources of light, namely the first stars and galaxies. Consequently, the detection and study of these objects are the key to unveil the early stages of the history of the Universe. Imaging plays a more important role than spectroscopy in searching for high-redshift galaxies because it permits to observe more objects at the same time, better managing the telescope time. Deep surveys, obtained by observing the same sky area for several days, are the answer to the need for detections of high-redshift galaxies. This thesis is focused on the study of the galaxy population existing when the Universe was less than 1. 5 Gyr old. When studying the early Universe, the detection of high-redshift sources depends strongly on the detection limit of the survey and the surface brightness of the objects themselves. Taking this into account, we made use of the deepest datasets currently available obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in both the optical and near-infrared (NIR) domain to carefully study how these two issues affect the identification and photometry of high-redshift galaxies. The important role played by high-redshift galaxies in cosmic reionization is no longer debated and, lately, most of studies agreed on the key relevance of galaxies that are below the current detection limit. While we are waiting for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to directly observe these faint galaxies, finding an alternative way to estimate their overall light contribution is mandatory. To this aim we developed a technique based on the power spectrum to analyze background fluctuations. Relying on a Lyman break-like approach we compared the power spectra of background signal derived from observations obtained in two adjacent bands to identify the light contribution from a population of galaxies lying within a specific redshift range. Then, Monte Carlo simulations permitted us to disentangle the information embedded in the light excess identified via power spectra, in particular deriving a constraint on the faint-end slope of the luminosity function. The UDF 05 dataset, follow-up of the original Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF), consists in observations in the optical bands obtained with the Advanced Camera for Survey (ACS). It permitted us to constrain the slope of the luminosity function at z 6 (0. 95 Gyr after the Big Bang), which turned out the be steep enough to allow bright and faint galaxies at that redshift to account for the ionizing photon budget required for cosmic reionization. The subsequent analysis aimed at deriving similar constraints on the faint-end slope of the luminosity function at z 7 - 8 (between 0. 64 and 0. 77 Gyr after the Big Bang) using deep observations in the near-infrared obtained with the infrared channel of the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC 3 -IR) during the HUDF 09 program. Regarding z âˆ¼ 8, the quality of the NIR dataset did not permit to disentangle any light produced by the faint galaxy population from the background noise and spurious signals. On the basis of the drop in the star formation rate density from z 6 to z 7 and beyond, there should be a more relevant contribution in terms of photoionizing photons at z 7 than at z 8 and we expected to be able to detect it. Unfortunately, the analysis at z 7 implied dealing with different detectors that are characterized by systematics that can not be erased by simply considering the ratio of the power spectra. Up to now the understanding of all WFC 3 /IR related problems is not as good as for ACS and a fur- ther analysis is needed before being able to use the IR dataset for the analysis of surface brightness fluctuations. Since a perfect reduction procedure of the images turned out to be an essential requirement to study any background signal, we performed an advanced data reduction to get an improved version of the deepest image of the Universe currently available, the so called eXtreme Deep Field (XDF). The goal was to create an image that allows to verify our findings on the faint-end slope of the luminosity function at z 6 since the XDF did not permit us to get any constraint on background fluctuations. We started from raw frames obtained from several proposals over 10 years and created hyperbiases and hyperdarks taking into account all the issues affecting ACS data, including the minor ones such as the herringbone effect. Then, we masked the <b>satellite</b> <b>trails,</b> aligned all the frames, and corrected for the chip-to-chip jump. We are still working on the dataset, in particular we are focused on modelling and correcting for the electronic ghost. Anyway, the preliminary check on photometry suggests a promising, even though small, achievement in term of signal to noise of the sources. The effect of surface brightness on the detection of primordial galaxies in deep surveys is directly depending on the cosmological surface brightness dimming that can be express in the form (1 + z) âˆ’ 4 and that affects all the sources. The strong dependence of surface brightness dimming with increasing redshift suggests the presence of a selection bias when searching for high-redshift galaxies, i. e. we tend to detect only those galaxies with a high surface brightness. Unresolved knots of emission are not affected by surface brightness dimming, thus allowing, in principle, to test clumpiness within high-redshift galaxies. We followed an empirical approach based on HST legacy datasets characterized by different depth to study the surface brightness dimming of galaxies. We selected a sample of Lyman-break galaxies at z 4 (1. 5 Gyr after the Big Bang) detected in the XDF, HUDF, and the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) datasets and found no significant trend when comparing the total magnitudes measured from images with different depth. Then, we compared our results to the prediction for mock sources derived from Monte Carlo simulations. In particular, considering different surface brightness profiles for the mock galaxies we were able to rule out all the extended profiles as fit for our data, getting a confirmation on the clumpy distribution of the light in high-redshift galaxies. The study of cosmological surface brightness dimming is also important since it could affect our prediction of what the upcoming JWST can observe at higher redshifts, where younger galaxies may exhibit a larger fraction of clumpiness. Our direct comparison showing that galaxies detected in GOODS do not become significantly brighter in the HUDF suggests that most of their light is compact and hints to the fact that JWST will likely not find diffuse star forming components. Finally, to complete the study on high-redshift galaxies we also focused on lower-redshift galaxies that could enter the high-redshift sample due to photometric scatter. In general interlopers are galaxies at z 1 - 2 showing colors similar to those of real dropout galaxies due to the 4000 A break. Even though their colors are likely to include them in the dropout sample, contaminants have a non negligible detection in the bands blueward of the Lyman-break. The preliminary study we performed using the multi-wavelength catalog obtained from CANDELS GOODS-South shows that the number counts of contaminants are significantly different from those of dropout galaxies at z 5 - 6 suggesting a clear difference in the luminosity functions of the two populations and little or no evolution in the population of interlopers entering the sample at different redshifts. Finally, we used the 3 D-HST catalogs for the GOODS-South field that provided us with photometric data in ground based, HST, and Spitzer/IRAC bands as well as with photometric redshfits. This catalog allowed a study on the interlopers at z 4 - 5...|$|R
