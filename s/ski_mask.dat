Though Demeke kept the pistol pointed at Goebel's head {{for the duration of}} the flight, he removed his <b>ski</b> <b>mask.</b> Goebel later told newspapers that he spent the hours trying to build a rapport with Demeke, who admitted to having spent several months planning the hijacking. Both men agreed that, upon arriving in New York, Goebel would give Demeke his sunglasses in exchange for Demeke's pistol.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Sleepy Hollows 150 visual effects shots were handled by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), while Kevin Yagher supervised {{the human and}} creature effects. Framestore also assisted on digital effects, and The Mill handled motion control photography. In part {{a reaction to the}} computer-generated effects in Mars Attacks!, Burton opted to use as limited an amount of digital effects as possible. Ray Park, who served as the Headless Horseman stunt double, wore a blue <b>ski</b> <b>mask</b> for the chroma key effect, digitally removed by ILM. Burton and Heinrichs applied to Sleepy Hollow many of the techniques they had used in stop motion animation on Vincent—such as forced perspective sets.|$|E

Unable to clear the jam, he dropped the rifle and drew a Beretta 92FS pistol, which he began firing. He was then shot in the right hand, causing him to drop the pistol. After retrieving it, he placed the muzzle under his chin and fired; he was simultaneously shot by a bullet that severed his spine. Officers across the street continued to shoot Phillips' body several times {{while he was on}} the ground. After the firing had stopped, officers in the area surrounded Phillips, cuffed him, and removed his <b>ski</b> <b>mask.</b>|$|E

500|$|Bundy {{was arrested}} on August 16, 1975 in Granger, another Salt Lake City suburb, by a Utah Highway Patrol officer who {{observed}} him cruising a residential area in the pre-dawn hours, then fleeing at high speed after seeing the patrol car. The officer noticed that the Volkswagen's front passenger seat had been removed and placed on the rear seats, and searched the car. He found a <b>ski</b> <b>mask,</b> a second mask fashioned from pantyhose, a crowbar, handcuffs, trash bags, a coil of rope, an ice pick, and other items initially assumed to be burglary tools. Bundy explained that the <b>ski</b> <b>mask</b> was for skiing, {{he had found the}} handcuffs in a dumpster, and the rest were common household items. However, Detective Jerry Thompson remembered a similar suspect and car description from the November 1974 DaRonch kidnapping, and Bundy's name from Kloepfer's December 1974 phone call. In a search of Bundy's apartment, police found a guide to Colorado ski resorts with a checkmark by the Wildwood Inn, and a brochure advertising the Viewmont High School play in Bountiful (where Debra Kent had disappeared), but nothing sufficiently incriminating to hold him. He was released on his own recognizance. (Bundy later said that searchers missed a collection of Polaroid photographs of his victims, which he destroyed after he was released.) ...|$|E
500|$|The {{tour was}} officially {{announced}} on April 28, 2014, via Jay-Z's Facebook page. Announcements shortly followed through Beyoncé's website and an official press release. Pre-sale tickets for fans {{to secure their}} seats first before the general sale were sold through Beyoncé's website and Chase credit and debit card users exclusively. A writer for Billboard noted that Chase was a surprising candidate for the official tour sponsor due to their lack {{of experience in the}} concert industry when compared to the live music sponsorship giants such as Citi and American Express. Chase allegedly scored the [...] "11th-hour" [...] deal due to previous connections with Roc Nation Sports (owned by Jay-Z) and a $4 million bid on the position. A promotional poster for the tour was revealed showing Jay-Z and Beyoncé embracing and wearing ski masks, following the criminals-on-the-lam narrative of the couple's two singles ("'03 Bonnie & Clyde" [...] and [...] "Part II (On the Run)"). Beyoncé also wore a similar <b>ski</b> <b>mask</b> in her 2013 video [...] "Superpower" [...] featuring Frank Ocean from her self-titled album. A second promotional poster was released on May 30, 2014, in an email to fans announcing the on sale times for certain tour dates. The poster features Beyoncé dressed in a white, short-cut wedding dress whilst sitting behind and hugging Jay-Z on a motorcycle.|$|E
500|$|Murdock {{begins the}} season {{wearing a black}} costume (called the [...] "vigilante outfit" [...] by production), {{inspired}} by the one worn by the character in Frank Miller's The Man Without Fear, rather than the more traditional red, horned suit. This was done to highlight the formation of Matt Murdock as Daredevil, with the costume evolving over time as the character develops. Marvel Comics' Chief Creative Officer Quesada conceptualized the look based on DeKnight's specifications. On the design process, DeKnight revealed that [...] "we tried practically everything, design-wise. We experimented {{with a lot of}} different head pieces. One version was a <b>ski</b> <b>mask</b> with the eyes sewn shut. We tried everything until we found something that just felt right." [...] DeKnight and Quesada explained that the idea was for Murdock to start out with a homemade outfit that fits more in the [...] "real-world" [...] of the series, and to then evolve it into the classic Daredevil suit. Maslansky noted that they wanted the outfit to [...] "look like something that Matt Murdock could put together himself, that he could either order off the Internet or shop around town....we wound up with pretty practical choices for him. His shirts are compression shirts and his pants wound up being from an army/navy store." [...] Concerning the black mask, Maslansky noted that a balance between aesthetic and safety was required, and that it was made of layers of cotton mesh that [...] "really conform to his head" [...] but also allowed Cox to see through the mask.|$|E
50|$|The {{government}} has been suspected in organising violent attacks on Muslims. In On June 8, 2009, at least 10 died in a shooting during the Muslim evening prayers. Five or six gunmen disguised themselves with <b>ski</b> <b>masks</b> attacked the mosque. The army denied involvement.|$|R

50|$|Some sources {{initially}} {{claimed the}} riots were orchestrated from outside forces.

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Superpower" [...] was {{directed}} by Jonas Åkerlund. It was filmed at the Hawthorne Plaza Shopping Center, a former shopping mall which was converted to a film set in Hawthorne, California. The singer was spotted by media on November 12, 2013 on the location set wearing a Louis Vuitton <b>ski</b> <b>mask</b> while filming the video. Beyoncé does not lip-sync or dance during the video. During an interview, she explained that [...] "Superpower" [...] was a song which [...] "you can just put on repeat and put you in this trance, which is why I didn't want to perform it in the video". With that being said, she wanted to focus on slow motion shots of [...] "really powerful imagery". It features former Destiny's Child members Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams as well as Pharrell Williams, Luke James and Les Twins. The director {{said that it was}} a [...] "spontaneous decision" [...] to include them in the video; Frank Ocean was also originally planned to appear. Åkerlund elaborated on the video: It's a very untraditional way of doing music videos, to not have her lip-synch. For Beyoncé, who's a dancer, it's very unusual to have a video without a dance part. I felt part of this idea for [...] "Superpower" [...] was to have stuff be in contrast to each other, so this song is very soft and very slow, but the action you see is aggressive and very big. We discussed it many times to see if we'd have the performance in the video or not. We decided no, and I think it works really, really well. It's kind of like a brave move, if you think about it. Most artists can act and have all these different things, but they'll still fall back on the performance.|$|E

After being followed from the vicinity of his apartment, the assassin spotted Bailey leaving the McDonald's restaurant, he then got out of the van, parked on Alice Street.

2500|$|Brinkman had {{a strong}} pro-life stance that was criticized by rival {{candidate}} Pat DeWine because he also opposed the death penalty - despite such opposition being seemingly more pro-life, {{as it is in}} accordance with the Consistent Life Ethic.
