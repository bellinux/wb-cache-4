40|$|Abstract The {{position}} of a drifting sine-wave grating enveloped by a stationary Gaussian is misperceived {{in the direction of}} motion. Previous research indicated that the illusion was larger when observers pointed {{to the center of the}} stimulus than when they indicated the stimulus position on a ruler. This conclusion was reexamined. Observers pointed to the {{position of}} a small Gabor patch on the screen or compared its position to moving patches, <b>stationary</b> <b>lines,</b> or flashed lines. With moving patches, the illusion was larger with probe than with motor judgments; with <b>stationary</b> <b>lines,</b> the illusion was about the same size; and with flashed lines, the illusion was smaller with probe than with motor judgments. Thus, the comparison between perceptual and motor measures depended strongly on the methods used. Further, the target was mislocalized toward the fovea with motor judgments, whereas the target was displaced away from the fovea relative to line probes...|$|R

The effect occurs both for moving lines under fixation and for <b>stationary</b> <b>lines</b> under ocular tracking of an external target. Orientation, length, and homogeneity of the obliques affect the magnitude of illusory displacement. We propose that this illusion {{is associated with a}} misregistration of the direction of displacement occurring, in lines slanted relative to the axis of their motion, because of the aperture problem...|$|R

The <b>stationary</b> <b>lines</b> appeared to be moving from right to left as the surrounds moved left to right. The simultaneous motion contrast found under monoptic conditions was maximal when the center pattern and the surrounds were the same color and was reduced when they differed in color. The surrounds had limited influence on the apparent motion of the center section under dichoptic condition, and the color relationship was no longer important. Related color selectivity has been reported for the motion aftereffect (successive motion contrast), and both sets of data can be attributed to inlaibitory interaction (simultaneous in one case and successive in the other) among neural detectors tuned to wavelength as well as the direction of image motion...|$|R

Vertical sequential, single-random-sequence, and continuously renewed random-sequence plotting displays generating 128 points at update rates up to 130 Hz are applied to images of <b>stationary</b> and moving <b>lines,</b> and best results are obtained with the single random sequence for the <b>stationary</b> <b>lines</b> and with the renewed random sequence for the moving lines...|$|R
40|$|<b>STATIONARY</b> <b>lines</b> {{appear to}} move upwards after {{prolonged}} visual exposure to downward moving lines. The experiment reported here {{shows that the}} movement after-effect is appreciably diminished when the moving lines observed during inspection are seen in red light and the <b>stationary</b> test <b>lines</b> are viewed in green light. We expected to obtain colour selectivity in the movement after-effect following the demonstration of motion-specific colour after-effects by Hepler 1. She found that alternate exposure to downward moving green lines and upward moving red lines caused downward moving lines later seen in white light to appear red and upward moving lines green. Hepler proposed that motion detectors in the human visual system are also selective to wavelength so that during exposure to one stimulus only the neural analysers tuned to both the specific direction of motion and the wavelength are excited. Because these analysers adapt during inspection and are suppressed {{for a period of}} time afterwards, the downward moving lines presented in white light as the test stimulus are signalled via downward-selective motion detectors tuned to the opposite colour. McCollough 2 has offered a similar explanation of colour after-effects which are specific to contour orientation...|$|R

Studying the Cauchy problem, we deal with moving curves represented by entire graphs on the x-axis. Here the initial curves are given by bounded functions on the x-axis. It is proved that the solution converges uniformly to {{the solution of the}} Cauchy problem of the heat equation with the same initial value. The difference is of order O(t− 1 / 2) as time goes to infinity. The proof is based on the decay estimates for the derivatives of the solution. By virtue of the stability results for the heat equation, our result gives the sufficient and necessary condition on the stability of constant solutions that represent <b>stationary</b> <b>lines</b> of the curvature flow in the whole plane...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{extent of}} {{perceived}} blur {{produced by a}} moving retinal image is less when the image motion occurs during pursuit eye movements compared to fixation. This study examined {{the effect of this}} reduced perception of motion blur during pursuit on spatial-interval acuity. Observers judged during pursuit at 4 or 8 deg/s whether the horizontal separation between two <b>stationary</b> <b>lines</b> was larger or smaller than a standard. Three different line separations were tested for each pursuit velocity. Each observer performed these judgments also during fixation, for spatial-interval stimuli that moved with the same mean and standard deviation of speeds as the distribution of eye velocities during pursuit. Spatial-interval acuity was better during pursuit than fixation for small or intermediate line separations. The results indicate that a reduction of perceived motion blur during pursuit eye movements can lead to improved visual performance...|$|R
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} microscale {{model was}} used to {{study the effects of}} moving vehicles on air pollution in the close vicinity of a road. The numerical results are compared to general findings from wind tunnel experiments and field observations. It was found that the model is suitable to capture the main flow characteristics within an urban street canyon, in particular the modifications relating to running traffic. A comparison of the results for a <b>stationary</b> <b>line</b> source approach and for multiple single moving sources demonstrates significant differences. For a street in a flat terrain, the near-road concentrations are underestimated by up to a factor of two if the emissions are approximated by a <b>stationary</b> <b>line</b> source. This underestimation decreases with increasing distance, and becomes negligible 30 – 50 [*]m away from the road. For an urban canyon situation, the line source assumption is a conservative approximation for the concentrations at the leeside of the street, while on the opposite pavement and wall, a systematic underestimation was found. Also, the effects of different traffic situations have been studied and discussed. DF...|$|E
40|$|In {{the course}} of the Hamburg/ESO survey we have {{discovered}} a white dwarf whose spectrum exhibits many similarities with the prototype of magnetic white dwarfs Grw+ 70 ^∘ 8247. In particular several <b>stationary</b> <b>line</b> components indicative for magnetic fields between about 150 and 400 MG are found in both objects. However, the features between 5000 and 5500 Å in the spectrum of HE 0241 - 0155 cannot be explained by <b>stationary</b> <b>line</b> components and demand a relatively homogeneous magnetic field with clustering around 200 MG. For this reason a pure dipole model failed to reproduce this spectral region.

40|$|A <b>stationary</b> <b>line</b> {{element of}} general {{relativity}} seems to be compatible to essential cosmological facts (though {{only as far as}} one can expect solving the nonlinear Einstein equations neglecting local cosmic evolution and all spatial inhomogeneities as well). There is a preferred spatially Euclidean cosmic reference frame where the extra-galactic speed of light is constant c* = c, and the galaxies are statistically at rest. Spectral rods and atomic clocks, however, do not indicate this cosmic space and this cosmic time. The solutions put up here for discussion are suitable to avoid serious difficulties in physics such as a beginning of the universe as a whole or the necessity of continuous creation of matter or an empty universe with a cosmological constant but no matter at all. Especially from the <b>stationary</b> <b>line</b> element, it follows a negative cosmic gravitational pressure of one third the critical energy density. In addition, there is an average baryonic radiation density equivalent to a black body radiation of approximately 3 K. The resulting increase of the time rate of natural clocks in comparison with cosmic time is a simple explanation for the redshift of starlight. This redshift turns out to be independent of time, thus indicating a stationary universe.

40|$|The authors {{describe}} a new visual illusion first {{discovered in a}} natural setting. A cyclist riding beside a pair of sagging chains that connect fence posts appears to {{move up and down}} with the chains. In this illusion, a static shape (the chains) affects the perception of a moving shape (the bicycle), and this influence involves assimilation (averaging) rather than opposition (differentiation). These features distinguish the illusion from illusions of motion capture and induced motion. The authors take this bicycle illusion into the laboratory and report 4 findings: Naïve viewers experience the illusion when discriminating horizontal from sinusoidal motion of a disc in the context of stationary curved lines; the illusion shifts from motion assimilation to motion opposition as the visual size of the display is increased; the assimilation and opposition illusions are dissociated by variations in luminance contrast of the <b>stationary</b> <b>lines</b> and the moving disc; and the illusion does not occur when simply comparing two stationary objects at different locations along the curved lines.
