5|$|HMS Glasgow {{returned}} to Newport, {{suffering from the}} battle and having dumped her dispatches. She {{was found to be}} in bad shape; she was made as <b>seaworthy</b> as possible and sent to Portsmouth for repairs. Her mission was reassigned to HMS Nautilus, another ship in the Newport squadron.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, {{which was}} also {{the second day of}} Battle of Thermopylae, the Persian fleet, now recovering from the two storms, declined to attack the Allies, and instead attempted to make the fleet <b>seaworthy</b> again. News of the shipwreck off Euboea reached the Allies that day, as well as a reinforcement of 53 ships from Athens.|$|E
5|$|The {{most recent}} {{surveys of the}} ship {{indicate}} that the ship was modified late in her career and have lent support {{to the idea that}} the Mary Rose was altered too much to be properly <b>seaworthy.</b> Marsden has suggested that the weight of additional heavy guns would have increased her draught so much that the waterline was less than one metre (c. 3 feet) from the gunports on the main deck.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} built in Brixham, England in 1956, and sailed to Plymouth across the Atlantic Ocean in 1957 by famous mariner Alan Villiers. The ship is still <b>seaworthy,</b> and {{routinely}} takes voyages around Plymouth Harbor. In the year 2007, the Mayflower II celebrated the 50th anniversary of its arrival in Plymouth.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on 26 June 1922, Asama resumed making {{training}} cruises, {{usually at}} two-year intervals, that {{took her to}} Australia, Southeast Asia, and the Mediterranean Sea among other places. They {{came to an end}} after she ran aground on the night of 13 October 1935 north north-west of the Kurushima Strait in the Inland Sea. Her bottom was badly damaged and she was deemed no longer <b>seaworthy</b> after repairs were completed at Kure Naval Arsenal. The ship was then assigned as a stationary training ship for the Kure Naval Corps on 5 July 1938.|$|E
5|$|By 1918, UB-10 {{had been}} {{converted}} into a minelayer by the replacement of her torpedo tubes with four mine chutes. UB-10 was seriously damaged in a British air raid on Flanders in July 1918, and was decommissioned in September 1918 in a worn out condition. She was not deemed <b>seaworthy</b> to sail to Germany when the bases in Flanders were being evacuated by the Germans in October 1918 and was scuttled off Zeebrugge in early October.|$|E
5|$|It was {{designed}} to replace the galleys {{that made up the}} core of the fleets that operated along the coasts and in the archipelagos of the Baltic Sea. The turuma had a bigger draft, was somewhat slower under oars, but offered superior accommodation for its crew, was more <b>seaworthy</b> and had roughly ten times the number of heavy guns. It could be propelled with either sails or oars and was both smaller and more manoeuvrable than most sailing warships which made it suitable for operations in shallow, confined waters.|$|E
5|$|The Kalamazoo-class {{monitors}} were a {{class of}} ocean-going ironclad monitors begun during the American Civil War. Unfinished {{by the end of}} the war, their construction was suspended in November 1865 and the unseasoned wood of their hulls rotted while they were still on the building stocks. If the four ships had been finished they would have been the most <b>seaworthy</b> monitors in the US Navy. One was scrapped in 1874 while the other three were disposed of a decade later.|$|E
5|$|The hemmema {{replaced}} the galleys {{that had made}} up {{the core of the}} Swedish archipelago fleets until the mid-18th century. Compared to galleys, the hemmema had a deeper draft and was slower under oars, but offered superior accommodation for the crew, carried more stores, was more <b>seaworthy</b> and had roughly ten times as many heavy guns. It could be propelled by either sails or oars but was still smaller and more maneuverable than most sailing warships, which made it suitable for operations in confined waters.|$|E
5|$|The {{makeshift}} raft is shown as barely <b>seaworthy</b> as it rides the deep waves, {{while the men}} are rendered as broken and in utter despair. One old man holds the corpse of his son at his knees; another tears his hair out in frustration and defeat. A number of bodies litter the foreground, waiting to be swept away by the surrounding waves. The men in the middle have just viewed a rescue ship; one points it out to another, and an African crew member, Jean Charles, stands on an empty barrel and frantically waves his handkerchief to draw the ship's attention.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{intended}} to be rigged as a three-masted schooner, like her half-sisters, but her first captain suggested that her fore- and mainmasts be square rigged to take advantage of her more <b>seaworthy</b> hull form. Kremls masts were hollow iron and were used to ventilate the lower decks, the first such masts in the Imperial Russian Navy. To protect her leadsmen, sailors who determined the depth of water under the keel, in combat, Kreml was fitted with two sounding tubes that led from the gun deck through the bottom of the hull.|$|E
5|$|While {{entering}} Puerto San Bartolomé in Baja California {{in early}} 1915, Asama struck an uncharted rock and was badly damaged. It took months to refloat {{her and to}} make her partially <b>seaworthy.</b> The ship was given temporary repairs at the British naval base at Esquimalt, British Columbia before arriving back in Japan in December where permanent repairs were not completed until March 1917. Asama {{was assigned to the}} Training Squadron later that year and made another cadet training cruise in 1918.|$|E
5|$|While {{the outcome}} of the battle was still undecided, a second British frigate——arrived. Outnumbered, the French captain saw no {{alternative}} and surrendered his ship. The late arrival of Arethusa—under Captain Robert Mends, who claimed the victory for himself—sparked a furious argument that developed into a lasting animosity between Mends and Captain Michael Seymour of Amethyst. The failure of Niémen to reach Isle de France also had serious repercussions for the French squadron there. With naval supplies severely limited, their ability to operate at sea {{for long periods of time}} was hampered and by late 1810 few of their vessels were still <b>seaworthy.</b>|$|E
5|$|After 1906, the Canadian Government {{took over}} the Halifax Dockyard (now CFB Halifax) from the Royal Navy. This {{dockyard}} later became the command centre of the Royal Canadian Navy upon its founding in 1910. Just before the First World War, the Canadian government began to make a determined, costly effort to develop the harbour and waterfront facilities. The outbreak of the war brought Halifax back to prominence. As the Royal Canadian Navy had virtually no <b>seaworthy</b> ships of its own, the Royal Navy assumed responsibility for maintaining Atlantic trade routes by re-adopting Halifax as its North American base of operations. In 1915, management of the harbour fell {{under the control of}} the Royal Canadian Navy under the supervision of Captain Superintendent Edward Harrington Martin; by 1917 there was a growing naval fleet in Halifax, including patrol ships, tugboats, and minesweepers.|$|E
5|$|As dawn {{broke and}} {{visibility}} cleared, the sailors on Ceylon, Vénus and Victor realised {{that they were}} within sight of Saint Denis on Île Bourbon, and thus vulnerable to counterattack from Rowley's flagship Boadicea. Despite hasty repairs, neither Ceylon nor Vénus were <b>seaworthy</b> by 07:30, when British lookouts on the island spotted the three ships and sent word to Rowley. Within ten minutes, Rowley was at sea, taking 50 volunteers from Africaine to augment his crew. Hamelin made desperate efforts to limp back to Île de France, ordering Victor to tow Ceylon, but progress was slow and strong winds, which did not help the dismasted Ceylon and Vénus, repeatedly broke the tow rope.|$|E
5|$|Both {{ships were}} caught in the harbour during the Battle of Weihaiwei in early 1895, with Zhenyuan only {{partially}} <b>seaworthy.</b> They were unable to prevent the capture of the port's fortifications by the Japanese, and underwent nightly attacks by torpedo boats. Dingyuen was hit by a torpedo and began to sink. She was quickly beached, where she settled into the mud, and continued {{to be used as a}} defensive fort. Admiral Ruchang's flag was subsequently moved across to Zhenyuan. Following Ruchang's suicide, the surrender of the port and the fleet was arranged. Dingyuen was blown up by the Japanese forces, as they were unable to salvage her, although there is a suggestion following an eye witness account that she may have been mined by the Chinese.|$|E
5|$|In 1883, when General Leo von Caprivi {{became the}} chief of the Imperial Navy, he {{discarded}} the fleet policy of his predecessor, Albrecht von Stosch, in favor of creating a fleet that could defend Germany's coast. To that end, he called for the construction of new coastal defense ships that were larger than the unsuccessful s but smaller than the s. They were to be sufficiently <b>seaworthy</b> to permit use in the North Sea, with armament and armor strong enough to allow them to engage larger, foreign battleships. Caprivi requested ten such vessels, though only eight would be built, the first six to the Siegfried design.|$|E
5|$|Later on that day, a deserter {{from the}} Persian fleet, a Greek called Scyllias, swam into the Allied camp. He brought {{bad news for}} the Allies — whilst most of the Persian fleet was {{undergoing}} repairs, the Persians had detached 200 <b>seaworthy</b> ships to sail around the outer coast of Euboea, to block the escape route of the Allied fleet. The Persians did not want to attack the Allies yet, because they thought the Allies would simply flee, and so they sought to trap them. The Allies resolved to go and meet this detachment, to prevent being trapped, though they planned to leave by nightfall to prevent the Persians becoming aware of their plans.|$|E
5|$|On 15 April, the British Admiral Henry Wood and the German Admiral Eugen Kalau vom Hofe {{began an}} {{inspection}} of the Ottoman fleet, which concluded that {{only a handful of}} ships were <b>seaworthy,</b> and as a result, should not be used offensively. Through April and May, the Ottoman fleet made several sorties into the Aegean Sea in an attempt to raise morale among the ships' crews, though the Ottomans had no intention of attacking Greek forces. On 15 May, Hamidiye and the ironclads Mesudiye, Necm-i Şevket, , and , along with several other vessels conducted a major training exercise under the supervision of von Hofe, where severe deficiencies in the level of training were revealed, particularly with the men's ability to operate the ships' guns. In September 1897, the war came to an end, and the Ottoman fleet returned to Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Simultaneous {{with the}} battle at Thermopylae, an Allied naval force of 271 triremes defended the Straits of Artemisium against the Persians. Directly before Artemisium, the Persian fleet {{had been caught}} in a gale {{off the coast of}} Magnesia, losing many ships, but could still {{probably}} muster over 800 ships {{at the start of the}} battle. On the first day (also the first of the Battle of Thermopylae), the Persians detached 200 <b>seaworthy</b> ships, which were sent to sail around the eastern coast of Euboea. These ships were to round Euboea and block the line of retreat for the Allied fleet. Meanwhile, the Allies and the remaining Persians engaged in the late afternoon, the Allies having the better of the engagement and capturing 30 vessels. That evening, another storm occurred, wrecking the majority of the Persian detachment which had been sent around Euboea.|$|E
5|$|Starting in the 1870s, {{following}} the Italian fleet's defeat at the Battle of Lissa, the Italians began a large naval expansion program, at first aimed at countering the Austro-Hungarian Navy. The Italias were the second {{class of the}} programme, which also included the , designed in the mid-1870s by Insp Eng Benedetto Brin. The ships were authorized in 1875, with funding allocated to begin construction the following year. They were faster and more <b>seaworthy</b> than the preceding Caio Duilio class, owing to their higher freeboard. Brin intended them {{to be capable of}} fighting successfully against any foreign warship in service, and so he opted for very large guns for the main battery.|$|E
5|$|USS Permit, {{under the}} command of Lieutenant WrefordG. Chapple, reached Tagauayan on 13 March, and found PT-32. With two of his three engines out of action, Schumacher felt that his boat was no longer <b>seaworthy.</b> He had Chapple destroy the boat with Permit deck gun. Chapple then took the fifteen PT-32 crewmen back to Corregidor. There, eight of the crew were dis{{embarked}}, while Chapple embarked forty more passengers, thirty-six of them codebreakers. Nonetheless, Chapple was ordered to conduct a regular war patrol, which he did. He finally reached Australia on 7 April. Unaware of this, Bulkeley attempted to locate PT-32. Over the next few days he flew over the area as a passenger in various aircraft, including a P-35 and a P-40, in the hope of finding it.|$|E
5|$|A {{preliminary}} enquiry into Magdalenas {{was held}} at Rio de Janeiro by the British Consul-General, who sent {{a report to the}} Minister of Transport, who ordered that a Court of Formal Investigation be held. The enquiry {{was held at}} the Royal Courts of Justice, London on 26–28 September 1949 with J. V. Naisby KC in charge, assisted by Captains Grimston and Williamson, and a Mr. Gray. Evidence was heard that the ship was <b>seaworthy,</b> and that the provision of rescue equipment on board either met or exceeded the required standard. The course selected was deemed to be correct, but the navigation of the ship was defective, with insufficient attention being paid to compass errors. Her captain had his master's certificate suspended for two years. Her first officer had his certificate suspended for a year, being allowed to hold a second mate's certificate during this time. These suspensions were effective from the date of the report's release on 3 October 1949.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed by {{the raid}} on Genoa, the {{authorities}} in Leghorn ordered Impérieuse to leave immediately. The frigate sailed north and took shelter at Fezzano, near the port of La Spezia. The French had decided that since capture was inevitable, the frigate should be destroyed, and beached the ship in order to remove guns and stores. Six days after the capture of Modeste, Captain reached La Spezia, acting on reports that Impérieuse was in the bay. Reeve discovered the French ship under the guns of the Santa Maria shore battery, and the following morning, 12 October, used his ship's boats to tow Captain alongside Impérieuse. At 08:00 boat parties from the ship of the line boarded the frigate, discovering that the remaining French crew had abandoned their disarmed ship during the night and scuttled it in shallow water. The British {{were able to take}} possession of Impérieuse without opposition from the battery. Reeve instructed his carpenters to make the frigate <b>seaworthy</b> again, refloating the ship and completing temporary repairs on 13 October before sailing back to Toulon with his prize.|$|E
5|$|Commentators {{generally}} agree that, {{to precipitate}} {{such a course}} of action as abandonment of an apparently sound and <b>seaworthy</b> ship, with ample provisions, some extraordinary and alarming circumstance must have arisen. In his evidence to the enquiry, Deveau ventured an explanation based on the sounding rod found on the derelict's deck. He suggested that Briggs abandoned ship after a sounding that, because of a malfunction of the pumps or other mishap, had given a false impression that the vessel was taking on water rapidly. A severe waterspout strike before the abandonment could explain the amount of water in the ship, and the ragged state of her rigging and sails. The low barometric pressure generated by the spout could have driven water from the bilges up into the pumps, leading the crew to assume the ship had taken on more water than she had, and was in danger of sinking.|$|E
5|$|In 1271, Niccolò, Maffeo and Marco Polo {{embarked}} on their voyage to fulfil Kublai's request. They sailed to Acre, and then rode on camels to the Persian port of Hormuz. The Polos wanted to sail straight into China, but the ships {{there were not}} <b>seaworthy,</b> so they continued overland through the Silk Road, until reaching Kublai's summer palace in Shangdu, near present-day Zhangjiakou. In one instance during their trip, the Polos joined a caravan of travelling merchants whom they crossed paths with. Unfortunately, the party was soon attacked by bandits, who used {{the cover of a}} sandstorm to ambush them. The Polos managed to fight and escape through a nearby town, but many members of the caravan were killed or enslaved. Three and a half years after leaving Venice, when Marco was about 21 years old, the Polos were welcomed by Kublai into his palace. The exact date of their arrival is unknown, but scholars estimate it to be between 1271 and 1275. On reaching the Yuan court, the Polos presented the sacred oil from Jerusalem and the papal letters to their patron.|$|E
5|$|In the {{background}} of the oval shield is the mountain Chimborazo, while the river originating from its base represents the Guayas. Chimborazo is also the highest mountain in Ecuador and is part of the Andes Range. The steamboat on the river is named Guayas as well. The ship was built in Guayaquil and was the first <b>seaworthy</b> steamship built in both Ecuador and in all of South America. It was first put into service on 9 October 1841. The ship has the features of a Caduceus representing trade and economy. This kind of mast has two wings surrounding a pole with two snakes encircling it. On top a golden sun surrounded by the Zodiac astrological signs for Aries, Taurus, Gemini and Cancer representing the months March to July to symbolize the duration of the March Revolution of 1845 that ousted General Juan José Flores.|$|E
5|$|On June 5, {{the party}} was spotted by a federal steamer, but {{convinced}} the crew they were hunters scavenging the coast. Two days later, they encountered a larger boat with a mast and rigging; chasing it down, they disarmed the occupants and hijacked the craft. As compensation, they gave their old boat and twenty dollars in gold to {{the owners of the}} larger craft, and returned some of their weapons after the exchange was complete. With this more <b>seaworthy</b> craft, they decided to flee to Cuba. Departing from Fort Dallas, they survived an encounter with pirates, two significant storms, and a dangerous lack of provisions before arriving in the city of Cárdenas on June 11, 1865. A Kentuckian then living in the city recognized Breckinridge, introduced him to the locals, and served as his interpreter. The refugees were given food and stayed the night in a local hotel. The next morning, they traveled by rail to Havana, where Breckinridge was offered a house. He declined the offer, choosing to travel with Charles J. Helm, a fellow Kentuckian who had been operating as a Confederate agent in the Caribbean, to Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|Ganteaume's fleet {{remained}} off the Cape Derna for {{the next}} six days, performing repairs to the captured vessel to make it <b>seaworthy.</b> Detachments of sailors were taken from all of the ships in the squadron and transferred to the prize, and on 30 June Ganteaume's force was ready to sail northwest once again, eventually reaching Toulon without further incident on 22 July. Ganteaume used the capture of Swiftsure to excuse the failure of his effort to reinforce Egypt, which was invaded and captured by a British expeditionary force {{in the spring and summer}} of 1801. While in captivity, Hallowell wrote a letter that was published in Britain praising the treatment he and his men had received while prisoners of war under Ganteaume, and he and his officers were released on parole the following month. On 18 August they faced a court martial on board HMS Genereux at Port Mahon in Menorca to investigate the loss of their ship, and were all honourably cleared of any blame. He was also praised for detaching the convoy, which otherwise might have also been lost. Hallowell subsequently returned to naval service in 1803 at the start the Napoleonic Wars, operating in the Caribbean and Mediterranean and eventually becoming a rear-admiral in 1811. Swiftsure, one of only five British ships of the line to be captured by the French during the entire war, was subsequently commissioned into the French Navy and remained in service {{for the next}} four years until recaptured at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805.|$|E
5|$|Inman {{had lost}} all his {{personal}} possessions {{in the destruction of}} Lark and was forced to replace his uniform from his own wages when the Navy refused to provide compensation. Returning to Britain in the frigate HMS Pearl, Inman was promoted to lieutenant in 1780 and returned to the Americas in HMS Camel, transferred soon afterwards into HMS Santa Monica in the West Indies. Shortly after his arrival however, Inman was once again shipwrecked when Santa Monica grounded off Tortola. Although the crew reached the shore in small boats, the ship broke up rapidly and once again Inman lost all of his possessions. Remaining on shore service in the West Indies for the next two years, Inman was again employed {{in the aftermath of the}} Battle of the Saintes, appointed to the prize crew of the captured French vessel Hector for the journey to Britain. Hectors masts and hull had been seriously damaged in the battle, requiring lighter spars to be fitted and 22 of her 74 guns removed to make her more <b>seaworthy.</b> As the fleet could not spare men to man her, the 223-strong prize crew was made up of men pressed in the Caribbean, principally invalids unfit for frontline service.|$|E
5|$|The {{departure}} of this combined squadron was observed by Captain Keats on Superb, which {{after returning to}} Cadiz had retained station off the port with HMS Thames and HMS Pasley. Thames was inshore searching a seized American merchant ship, and witnessed {{the emergence of the}} squadron, retreating before four ships of the line that approached the British frigate. Superb was sighted shortly afterwards and also retreated before a ship of the line and two frigates, reconstituting his small squadron in the wake of Moreno's force. Keats immediately sent Pasley ahead to Gibraltar to warn Saumarez, the brig arriving at 15:00 closely followed by {{the main body of the}} combined squadron, from which Saint Antoine had detached during the departure from Cadiz and was following behind, shadowed by Superb. Moreno's squadron anchored in the Bay of Gibraltar, out of reach of the British batteries on Gibraltar and waited there for Linois to complete his repairs, Saint Antoine joining the squadron on the morning of 10 July. Keats then brought his ships into Gibraltar, where efforts to repair the squadron were increased, with the knowledge that Moreno would soon be sailing to Cadiz with Linois squadron. Saumarez, concerned by the size of the combined squadron, sent urgent messages to the Mediterranean Fleet under Lord Keith in the Eastern Mediterranean requesting support in the belief that Moreno would be delayed at least two weeks due to the condition of Linois's ships. Saumarez was wrong: Moreno planned to convoy the battered squadron the short distance to Cadiz as soon as they were <b>seaworthy.</b>|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of Villeneuve's fugitives, the French Mediterranean Fleet had been annihilated. Nine of eleven ships of the line had been captured or destroyed, {{as well as two}} frigates. French casualties totalled more than 3,000 and possibly as many as 5,000, compared to British losses of 218 killed and 677 wounded. However, many of Nelson's ships were seriously damaged, and urgent repairs were required for both his own ships and the captured prizes before they could begin the long voyage back to Britain. For more than two weeks Nelson remained in Aboukir Bay, effecting repairs, writing despatches and assessing the strategic situation in Egypt. The first ship detached from his squadron was Leander, sent on 5 August to the fleet under Earl St. Vincent off Cadiz with reports of the battle. On 8 August Aboukir Island was stormed and captured, and on 12 August Emerald, Alcmene and Bonne Citoyenne finally caught up with the fleet, followed on 17 August by Seahorse and Terpsichore. Mutine was detached on 13 August with despatches for the Admiralty and on 14 August Nelson sent seven ships with the six <b>seaworthy</b> prizes to the mouth of Aboukir Bay under the command of Saumarez. This convoy sailed for Gibraltar on 15 August and the following day Nelson burnt Heureux, followed on 18 August by Mercure and Guerrier, none of which were fit for continued service. On 19 August Nelson separated his remaining ships, leading three vessels northwards towards Naples and leaving a blockade squadron off Alexandria of Zealous, Goliath, Swiftsure and the frigates, under Captain Samuel Hood.|$|E
5|$|The southward {{expansion}} of the Han dynasty led to new trade routes and diplomatic contact with foreign kingdoms. In 111 BCE, Emperor Wu conquered the Kingdom of Nanyue {{in what is now}} modern northern Vietnam and Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan; thereafter he opened up maritime trade to both Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean, as foreign merchants brought lapis lazuli, pearls, jade, and glasswares to the Han Empire from this southern sea route. When a group of travelers from the Roman Empire (allegedly diplomats of Marcus Aurelius but most likely Roman merchants) came to the Han court in 166 CE, they allegedly came from this southern trade route. By at least the 1st century CE— as proven by Eastern Han ceramic miniature models of ships found in various tombs— the Chinese {{would have been able to}} brave distant waters with the new steering invention of the stern-mounted rudder. This came to replace the less efficient steering oar. While ancient China was home to various ship designs, including the layered and fortified tower ship meant for calm waters of lakes and river, the junk design (jun 船) created by the 1st century CE was China's first <b>seaworthy</b> sailing ship. The typical junk has a square-ended bow and stern, a flat-bottomed hull or carvel-shaped hull with no keel or sternpost, and solid transverse bulkheads in the place of structural ribs found in Western seacrafts. Since the Chinese junk lacked a sternpost, the rudder was attached to the back of the ship by use of either socket-and-jaw or block and tackle (which differed from the later European pintle and gudgeon design of the 12th century). As written by a 3rd-century author, junks had for-and-aft rigs and lug sails.|$|E
25|$|The {{ships were}} reliable, long-ranged, and <b>seaworthy,</b> and had good habitability.|$|E
25|$|Once <b>seaworthy,</b> meticulous {{trials were}} {{conducted}} to measure every aspect of Graphs sailing and diving characteristics. Even the Zeiss binoculars found on board were carefully tested.|$|E
