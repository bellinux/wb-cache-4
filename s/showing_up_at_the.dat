His old buddy, Colonel McKee (Charles McGraw), tries his best for him, but the base commander, Brigadier General Banner (Lloyd Nolan), turns him down because he cannot trust him to be stable. A complication is that the general's secretary and love interest, Connie Mitchell (Virginia Leith), is an old flame. Bond presses for a job and accepts the general's offer of routine flying in support. Banner is a hands-on leader, taking the most dangerous assignments himself.|$|E

[...] Fearing for his son's safety, Bearcat jumped into the fray himself, suffering the injury. While being wheeled into an ambulance, Murray blew kisses for the cameras. [...] The incident caught the attention of a group of fans in Boston, who formed the [...] "Bearcat Murray Fan Club", and began <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Boston Garden wearing skull caps and oversized moustaches mimicking Murray's looks when the Flames played there. [...] The Flames lost players on the ice during the physical series as well, as Carey Wilson required surgery to remove his spleen after he was [...] "skewered" [...] by Steve Smith, according to Johnson.

500|$|Prior to the Tupelo Honey {{recording}} sessions, Morrison {{had recorded}} demo tracks in Woodstock {{for an upcoming}} country-and-western album. Some of the tracks planned for Tupelo Honey did appear on the album, [...] but other more traditional country songs like [...] "The Wild Side of Life", [...] "Crying Time" [...] and [...] "Banks of the Ohio" [...] were abandoned. Morrison decided to move from Woodstock when the lease on his house expired and the landlord wanted to move back in. He explained to Richard Williams in Melody Maker that {{the release of the}} documentary film, Woodstock, in 1970 had altered the quaint character of the [...] community: [...] "Everybody and his uncle started <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bus station, and that was the complete opposite of what it was supposed to be." [...] In April 1971, before he began recording on the planned album, [...] Morrison and his family moved to Marin County, California, where his wife Janet Planet had family living close by. Morrison's guitarist at the time, John Platania, told biographer Steve Turner that Morrison [...] "didn't want to leave, but Janet wanted to move out West. He was manipulated into going." [...] The Morrisons' new home was in a rural setting situated on a hillside close to San Francisco amid redwood trees. With the move, Morrison abandoned the idea of a full country album and exchanged some of the intended material for songs he had written earlier.|$|E

[...] Unfortunately, the original contractor had left much of the material ordered unused, and had done a subpar job in building the new wall from cinderblocks meant for {{the foundation of a}} house— which was completely inappropriate given the size of the wall needed. [...] As the original contractor stopped <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> home and became difficult to reach, the concerned homeowners even inquired as to whether the contractor had been injured at another site, and only realized that they had been victimized when a bill for the unused material had shown up at their door.|$|E

[...] Having noticed that he is being followed by someone from The Company, Noah Bennet drives to a cybercafé and sends a message to Hana asking for help, which she agrees to do. The episode ends with Noah Bennet taking Claire to the same bridge on which he shot Claude so many years ago. The Haitian shows up, and Bennet instructs the Haitian to shoot him in the stomach, then [...] "Go deep" [...] and wipe anything out of his memory that could lead [...] "them" [...] to Claire.
