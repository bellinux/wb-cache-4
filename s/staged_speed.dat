40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Airline {{operations}} {{are subject to}} frequent disruptions typically due to unexpected aircraft maintenance requirements and undesirable weather conditions. Recovery from a disruption often involves propagating delays in downstream flights and increasing cruise <b>stage</b> <b>speed</b> when possible {{in an effort to}} contain the delays. However, there is a critical trade-off between fuel consumption (and its adverse impact on air quality and greenhouse gas emissions) and cruise speed. Here we consider delays caused by such disruptions and propose a flight rescheduling model that includes adjusting cruise <b>stage</b> <b>speed</b> on a set of affected and unaffected flights as well as swapping aircraft optimally. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in which the cruise speed is explicitly included as a decision variable into an airline recovery optimization model along with the environmental constraints and costs. The proposed model allows one to investigate the trade-off between flight delays and the cost of recovery. We show that the optimization approach leads to significant cost savings compared to the popular recovery method delay propagation. Flight time controllability, nonlinear delay, fuel burn and CO 2 emission cost functions, and binary aircraft swapping decisions complicate the aircraft recovery problem significantly. In order to mitigate the computational difficulty we utilize the recent advances in conic mixed integer programming and propose a strengthened formulation so that the nonlinear mixed integer recovery optimization model can be solved efficiently. Our computational tests on realistic cases indicate that the proposed model may be used by operations controllers to manage disruptions in real time in an optimal manner instead of relying on ad-hoc heuristic approaches...|$|R

BPI's process involves a proprietary low temperature pretreatment step which allows recycle of the pretreatment chemicals and recovery of a lignin stream. The pretreated biomass is then converted to glucans and xylans enzymatically and these sugars simultaneously fermented to ethanol (SSF) in BPI's Continuous Stirred Reactor Separator (CSRS). The CSRS is a multi stage bio-reactor where the glucans are first converted to ethanol using a high temperature tolerant yeast stran, followed by xylan SSF on the lower stages using a second xylose fermenting yeast strain.

By reinforcing the optimal action selected, the action policy of cyclic states is optimized gradually.

40|$|Abstract—A hybrid MPI/Pthreads parallelization was {{implemented}} in the RAxML phylogenetics code. New MPI code {{was added to the}} existing Pthreads production code to exploit parallelism at two algorithmic levels simultaneously: coarsegrained with MPI and fine-grained with Pthreads. This hybrid, multi-grained approach is well suited for current highperformance computers, which typically are clusters of multicore, shared-memory nodes. The hybrid version of RAxML is especially useful for a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis, i. e., execution of many rapid bootstraps followed by a full maximum likelihood search. Multiple multi-core nodes {{can be used in a}} single run to speed up the computation and, hence, reduce the turnaround time. The hybrid code also allows more efficient utilization of a given number of processor cores. Moreover, it often returns a better solution than the stand-alone Pthreads code, because additional maximum likelihood searches are conducted in parallel using MPI. The comprehensive analysis algorithm involves four stages, in which coarse-grained parallelism continually decreases from stage to stage. The first three <b>stages</b> <b>speed</b> up well with MPI, while the last <b>stage</b> <b>speeds</b> up only with Pthreads. This leads to a tradeoff in effectiveness between MPI and Pthreads parallelization. The useful number of MPI processes increases with the number of bootstraps performed, but typically is limited to 10 or 20 by the parameters of the algorithm. The optimal number of Pthreads increases with the number of distinct patterns in the columns of the multiple sequence alignment, but is limited to the number of cores per node of the computer being used. For a benchmark problem with 218 taxa, 1, 846 patterns, and 100 bootstraps run on the Dash computer at SDSC, the speedup of the hybrid code on 10 nodes (80 cores) was 6. 5 compared to the Pthreads-only code on one node (8 cores) and 35 compared to the serial code. This run used 10 MPI processes with 8 Pthreads each. For another problem with 125 taxa, 19, 436 patterns, and 100 bootstraps, the speedup on th...|$|R

50|$|Following the {{cancellation}} of stages in Rally Sweden when the front-running cars exceeded the maximum average speed mandated by the FIA, Rally Finland was forced to revise its route {{to find ways of}} keeping the average <b>stage</b> <b>speed</b> down—with some estimates predicting that the 2017 generation of cars could exceed 140 kph mph—to avoid stage cancellations. This was achieved by installing artificial chicanes into all but two of the stages, which proved to be controversial as drivers complained that they were too narrow and thus had the potential to damage cars, and were poorly-positioned with little regulatory oversight from rally organisers. With Rallye Deutschland moving to a new headquarters, the rally routed was revised. The vineyard and military proving ground stages in the Baumholder region were retained, but the final leg of the route was changed to introduce high-speed stages based on country lanes.|$|R

Therefore, in this paper we evaluate the three primary approaches to digital slide scanning in light field microscopy: field-of-view (FOV) scan, line scan and slanted specimen scan.

Treadmill speed, oxygen uptake (V O 2), heartrate (HR), rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and plasma lactate were measured for each stage, and calculated at: fixed blood lactate accumulation (FBLA) 4. 0 mmol/L, an initial 1 mmol/L rise, deviation maximum (D max), lactate threshold (LT) and log-log LT. There was no effect (p> 0. 05) of <b>stage</b> duration on <b>speed,</b> V O 2, HR and RPE at fixed markers.

40|$|Displacement {{measuring}} interferometry {{is based}} on measuring the Doppler frequency shift that a beam of radiation undergoes upon reflection off a mir-ror connected to a moving stage. Usually the velocity of the reflecting stage is very small compared to {{the speed of light}} and is therefore deduced using the classical expression for the Doppler shift. We calculate relativistic cor-rections to the Doppler frequency shift, considering arbitrary stage motion in two dimensions and multiple passes through the moving interferometer arm. Changes in optical path lengths due to the varying stage displacement are explicitly taken into account. For stage velocities on the order of only 1 m/s the resulting corrections to the classically derived stage displacement can amount to nanometers. We discuss model velocity profiles similar to those currently employed in industrial step-and-scan systems for integrated circuit manufacturing, and for recently proposed scanning-beam interference litho-graphy schemes.
