25|$|While {{researching the}} First Folios in the Folger Library, Robert Evans came across an epitaph for Shakespeare that was {{previously}} unrecorded. The epitaph appears in verse, {{similar to that}} of the sonnets, and <b>shows</b> <b>just</b> how highly Shakespeare's contemporaries thought of his work. The lines of the epitaph themselves echo lines from sonnet 55, which bring into thought the ideas of that particular sonnet itself. Through the verses of the sonnet, the young man becomes immortal. Through the verses of the epitaph, as well as the larger context of praise for the dead poet, Shakespeare himself becomes immortal, echoing and reinforcing his very argument in sonnet 55.|$|E

There is not much released to the public about Lloyd despite her being a figure who fought for educational programs to benefit women at a time when progressive movements had not taken preeminence. This is most clearly shown in a correspondence between the editor of A Biographical Dictionary and Mary T. Bromage, who spent significant time on a biography of Lloyd over whether she {{should be included in the}} dictionary. The editor, Edward James believed Lloyd did not have much influence outside of Michigan despite her numerous leadership positions before her death. Nevertheless, her legacy continues to live on to this day and is seen in the numerous advancements that women have made at the University of Michigan and in higher education as a whole.|$|E

Ringo Starr arrived on the Thursday, and by Friday, 30 July, Russell was in town, interrupting his US tour. Russell's band members Claudia Linnear and Don Preston were added to Don Nix's choir of backing singers; Preston would switch to lead guitar for Russell's solo spot during the <b>shows,</b> <b>just</b> as bassist Carl Radle would replace Voormann temporarily. By this point, Clapton's participation was gravely in doubt, and Harrison had drafted in Jesse Ed Davis as a probable replacement. The ex-Taj Mahal guitarist received last-minute coaching from Voormann, who was more than familiar with Harrison's songs, as well as those by Billy Preston and Starr.|$|E
500|$|... "Sad" [...] is a piano ballad with {{a length}} of three minutes and {{fourteen}} seconds. It is written in the key of E minor, in common time, with a tempo of 116 beats per minute. Levine's vocal range spans from the low note of D4 to the high note of G5. [...] "Sad" [...] highlights Levine's soulful tone that his voice possesses. Nick Levine of NME labeled the song as [...] "an Adele-apeing weepie". Similarly, The New York Times Nate Chinen compared [...] "Sad" [...] to Adele's 2011 single [...] "Someone Like You". Rick Florino of Artistdirect wrote that it [...] "echoes Elton John in terms of epic scope and <b>shows</b> <b>just</b> how vulnerable Levine can get." [...] Lyrically, [...] "Sad" [...] is a song on which Levine [...] "achingly" [...] declares {{the end of his}} relationship and his heartbreak. According to Jacqui Swift, it was inspired by the singer's break up with Victoria's Secret model Anne Vyalitsyna. The song begins with the lyrics, [...] "Man, it's been a long day stuck thinking 'bout it." [...] The chorus is simple and consists of Levine singing [...] "I'm so Sad".|$|E

500|$|The {{success of}} the game spawned a franchise, with 16 sequels or {{spin-offs}} released to date. Due to its complex physics engine and abundance of possible shortcuts, Super Monkey Ball has been popular with professional speedrunners. A 2006 {{study conducted by the}} Beth Israel Medical Center found that surgeons who played the game for 20 minutes prior to performing a surgical drill finished slightly faster and made fewer mistakes. Super Monkey Ball inspired Neverball, a free game for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, Dreamcast, and iOS. In 2006, Nintendo Power ranked it the 38th best game available on Nintendo platforms, commenting [...] "who knew that such cute characters with cinnamon roll ears could be the source of so much tension (when the clock is ticking) and so much relief (when they finally break the ribbon)?" [...] In 2009, Edge ranked the game #39 on its list of [...] "The 100 Best Games To Play Today", stating [...] "Seeing its sturdy physics model being used to perform incredible acrobatic feats <b>shows</b> <b>just</b> how finely honed it is."

500|$|Hock Guan Teh of DVD Town said {{he enjoyed}} the episode, and {{although}} it does not contain the [...] "usual amount" [...] of The Simpsons humor, the [...] "rich character development itself makes this episode worth multiple viewings.

[...] Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict thought the episode featured [...] "one of the best" [...] parodies the Simpsons writers have ever conceived, the parody of the country television series Hee-Haw called Ya-Hoo!: [...] "While one must give multiple kudos to Beverly D'Angelo for writing and performing her own witty hillbilly ditties, it's the twisted cornpone , with such stars as Big Shirtless Ron and Cappy Mae, that really propels this installment into comic heaven. Homer's sheepish response to Lurlene's advances <b>shows</b> <b>just</b> what a decent, family loving man he is." [...] A reviewer for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram called the episode [...] "heartwarming", and commented that The Simpsons [...] "once again shows that {{at the heart of}} this crazy family there is an abiding love." [...] Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club said [...] "it's a pretty impossible question for a die-hard fan, but if I were forced at gunpoint to name my favorite episode ever, 'Colonel Homer' would probably be the first to leap to mind, if only for the pure joy that is 'Bagged Me a Homer'." ...|$|E
500|$|Celebration {{received}} {{a score of}} 84/100 at Metacritic, indicating [...] "universal acclaim" [...] from music critics. Sarah Crompton from The Daily Telegraph gave the collection {{four out of five}} stars and said: [...] "Madonna's Celebration <b>shows</b> <b>just</b> how consistently she delivers the goods, with tracks such as 'Music', 'Ray of Light', 'Frozen' and 'Don't Tell Me'", with [...] "only a couple of [...] which feel dispensable." [...] Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine gave the compilation four out of five stars and commented that [...] "functionally, what Madonna and fans are really celebrating with the release of Celebration is the hard proof that Madonna's back catalogue is now so immense and so varied that she can release a behemoth, two-disc greatest hits package that shoehorns in 36 songs and still manages to significantly short-change the singer's legacy", though also noticing that [...] "the album is missing songs, doesn't always include the right ones, [...] seems to have been sequenced by a not particularly intuitive Genius playlist." [...] Tim Sendra from AllMusic praised that [...] "the collection does a fine job of living up to the titleâ it's certainly a celebration of Madonna's career and includes some of the most celebratory and thrilling pop music ever created." [...] While reviewing the double-disc deluxe edition version of the album, he commented: [...] "The 34-track double-disc Deluxe Edition has an easier time of it than the single-disc 18-track release does."

[...] Told of the show's success in the TV Guide [...] "Save Our Shows" [...] poll, Sandy Grushow said, [...] "Obviously I'm happy and not entirely surprised", but added, [...] "You can't dismiss a season's worth of ratings." [...] Kim Manners, director on {{nearly a third of the}} Brisco episodes, said working on the series gave him an opportunity to grow creatively. He told writer Joe Nazzaro, [...] "It really woke me up as a director, almost spiritually", and that directing for Brisco was a large contributing factor to his success as a regular director on The X-Files. Manners said, [...] "When they didn't give it a second year, I was devastated", adding that he wished Cuse would have made a feature film based on Brisco. Considering the show's short life, Cuse later commented, [...] "If the show could have survived into a second season, I think it could have ended up running for actually a long time. Some <b>shows</b> <b>just</b> sort of fall through the cracks in the right away and they kind of stay on the air long enough to aggregate an audience. I think if circumstances had been different, Brisco could have had a much longer life." [...] Cuse also said the Friday night time slot hurt Briscos chances of building an audience, saying, [...] "We were on at 8 p.m. on Friday night, which is sort of a death slotâ I mean people do still go bowlingâ few shows have succeeded in that slot." ...|$|E
