The long run of these musical broadcasts was heard on NBC from 1925 to 1956, encompassing {{a variety of}} vocalists and musicians. In 1944, it was retitled Highways in Melody, and later the series was known as The Cities <b>Service</b> <b>Band</b> of America.

2500|$|After World War I, the {{presence}} and quality of marching bands in the American public school system expanded as military veterans with <b>service</b> <b>band</b> experience began to accept music teaching positions within schools across the country, eventually bringing wind music and marching band into both educational curriculum and school culture. With high school programs on the rise, marching bands started to become competitive organizations, with the first national contest being held in 1923 in Chicago, Illinois. [...] State and national contests became common, often featuring parades and mass-band concerts featuring all participating groups. [...] By 1938, competitive band programs had become numerous and widespread, making a national contest too large to manage and leading to multiple state and regional contests in its place. [...] Today, state contests {{continue to be the}} primary form of marching band competition in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Due to this {{dearth of}} {{performance}} opportunities, aspiring euphonium {{players in the}} United States are in a rather inconvenient position when seeking future employment. [...] Often, college players must either obtain a graduate degree {{and go on to}} teach at the college level, or audition for one of the major or regional military service bands. Because these bands are relatively few in number and the number of euphonium positions in the bands is small (2–4 in most service bands), job openings do not occur very often and when they do are highly competitive; before the current slate of openings in four separate bands, the last opening for a euphonium player in an American <b>service</b> <b>band</b> was in May 2004. A career strictly as a solo performer, unaffiliated with any university or performing ensemble, is a very rare sight, but some performers, such as Riki McDonnell, have managed to do it.|$|E
2500|$|The annual {{lighting}} {{ceremony for}} the National Community Christmas Tree was growing {{quickly in the}} 1950s. [...] In 1953, the New York Times reported that millions of Americans were watching the ceremony on television. There were also pressures to expand the event. For roughly 15 years, the ceremony had remained largely the same. A local choir would sing some carols and a military <b>service</b> <b>band</b> would play a selection of Christmas music for a half-hour before the president emerged to speak briefly and light the tree. [...] A member of the Boy Scouts of America and either the Girl Scouts of America or the Camp Fire Girls would greet the president {{on behalf of the}} people of the city of Washington. After the president returned to the White House, the band would play more music for a half-hour, and then the public would be cleared from the area. [...] In 1952, however, a group of Catholic Church sodalities asked that a nativity scene be included in the ceremony. The request was repeated in 1953. There was also pressure to move the ceremony off the White House's South Lawn. In 1953, only 700 members of the public were allowed onto the White House grounds (while another 3,500 watched from outside the fence) due to security concerns.|$|E

[...] His dining with a black friend from high school – {{at a time when the}} Army was still racially segregated – led to his being demoted and reassigned to Graves Registration Service duties. Subsequently, he sang with the 314th Army Special <b>Services</b> <b>Band</b> under the stage name Joe Bari (a name he had started using before the war, chosen after the city and province in Italy and as a partial anagram of his family origins in Calabria). He played with many musicians who would have post-war careers.|$|R

50|$|GPS {{receiver}} manufacturers design GPS receivers to use spectrum {{beyond the}} GPS-allocated band. In some cases, GPS receivers {{are designed to}} use up to 400 MHz of spectrum in either direction of the L1 frequency of 1575.42 MHz, because mobile satellite services in those regions are broadcasting from space to ground, and at power levels commensurate with mobile satellite services. However, as regulated under the FCC's Part 15 rules, GPS receivers are not warranted protection from signals outside GPS-allocated spectrum. This is why GPS operates next to the Mobile Satellite <b>Service</b> <b>band,</b> and also why the Mobile Satellite <b>Service</b> <b>band</b> operates next to GPS. The symbiotic relationship of spectrum allocation ensures that users of both bands are able to operate cooperatively and freely.|$|E
