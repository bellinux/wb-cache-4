5|$|The jackalope can {{imitate the}} human voice, {{according}} to legend. During {{the days of}} the Old West, when cowboys gathered by the campfires singing at night, jackalopes could be heard mimicking their voices or <b>singing</b> <b>along,</b> usually as a tenor. It is said that jackalopes, the rare Lepus antilocapra, only breed during lightning flashes and that their antlers make the act difficult despite the hare's reputation for fertility.|$|E

5|$|Life {{with her}} {{grandmother}} was strict and, as Mambo felt depressed without her father, she became withdrawn, sticking to a daily routine of prayers and studying. However, she performed well at school, ranking amongst the top five in her class at Yapenka Elementary School in South Jakarta. She later became more outgoing and was known among {{her family and friends}} as a very feminine child, enjoying dresses and make-up. While in elementary school she began <b>singing</b> <b>along</b> with songs by her favourite singers Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston in her bedroom. Her mother, believing that Mambo had the ability to be a professional singer, convinced Mambo to try and sing in public while the latter was still in junior high school.|$|E

25|$|A {{comparison}} of rockabilly versions of country songs shows that while form, lyrics, chord progressions and arrangements are simplified and with sparser instrumentation, a fuller sound {{was achieved by}} more percussive playing—i.e., subdivisions of the beat receive more emphasis. Tempos were increased, texts are altered with deletions, additions, more intense, flamboyant loose <b>singing,</b> <b>along</b> with variation in melody from verse to verse.|$|E

25|$|The {{technology}} behind SingStar {{began as}} a research project into sound input by SCE London Studio's prototyping department. The project was initially focused on developing a pitch detection system and game concepts aimed at a children's audience. Two main game concepts were developed: Songlines, a third-person adventure game in which the player would sing to unlock new environments, and SingAlong Safari, where players would complete missions by <b>singing</b> <b>along</b> with animals.|$|E
25|$|In addition, it {{is common}} for the Gregory Brothers to alter footage by {{superimposing}} their own mouths or arms onto individuals who were in the original video clip; compare Syncro-Vox. This effect is often used to make those individuals appear to be <b>singing</b> <b>along</b> or enthusiastically getting into the music. The Gregory Brothers sometimes use this technique to make people appear to play percussion (such as drums, the tambourine and the cowbell) or other instruments (such as the theremin) along with the music.|$|E

25|$|K. R. Ramaswamy was {{a popular}} Tamil actor of both stage and screen in the 1940s and 50s. He {{was one of the}} {{founding}} leaders of the DMK and it was his earnings that initially financed the party. A talented singer and actor, he was called a Nadipisai Pulavar (acting and singing poet) by the popular masses. Improvements in technology in the film industry, including playback <b>singing,</b> <b>along</b> with personal problems ended the career of Ramaswamy. Nevertheless, he was nominated {{as a member of the}} Legislative Council (upper house of the State) by Annadurai in recognition of his service to the party.|$|E
25|$|In Flames' musical {{style is}} {{characterized}} by the constant use of harmonized lead guitar melodies and screaming-style <b>singing</b> <b>along</b> with death growl. In early albums such as The Jester Race, In Flames would often employ two harmonized lead guitars playing over a rhythm guitar. However, since the band only has two guitar players, they found it hard to reproduce those songs during live performances and ever since Reroute to Remain they have focused on writing songs with the intention of playing them live. On the album Soundtrack to Your Escape, the band focused on less guitar melodies, giving place for more synths. However, this has not been continued on the later albums.|$|E
25|$|According to Fast Food Nation by Eric Schlosser (2001), {{nearly one}} in eight workers in the U.S. have at some time been {{employed}} by McDonald's. Employees are encouraged by McDonald's Corp. to maintain their health by <b>singing</b> <b>along</b> to their favorite songs in order to relieve stress, attending church services {{in order to have}} a lower blood pressure, and taking two vacations annually in order to reduce risk for myocardial infarction. Fast Food Nation also states that McDonald's is the largest private operator of playgrounds in the U.S., as well as the single largest purchaser of beef, pork, potatoes, and apples. The selection of meats McDonald's uses varies to some extent based on the culture of the host country.|$|E

25|$|Graham {{is seated}} {{to the right}} of the picture, on the left of the table that divides the picture. He is seen in full length, facing {{forwards}} though looking to the side, while smoking a long pipe. Standing to Graham's right, his lower half obscured by the table cloth, a man holds a sheet of music and is in the act of singing. The third member of the dining party is seated on the left of the painting, and like Graham is visible in full length. Ronald Paulson identifies them as the ship's clerk and chaplain. The music the men are listening or <b>singing</b> <b>along</b> to is provided by a black manservant, standing on the right of the painting and playing a pipe and tabor. A steward stands opposite him on the left of the painting, framing the composition. The steward holds a plate of roast duck, but looks out of the painting towards the viewer with a smile, while gravy drips from the plate down the back of the chaplain's coat. The remaining members of the portrait are two dogs. One is Graham's own, sitting at the chaplain's feet and apparently joining in the singing. The other, sat on his haunches on a chair on the right of the painting, is Hogarth's own pug, Trump. Trump, his tongue lolling out and wearing Graham's wig, holds a scroll and appears to read from his own sheet of music, balanced against a wine glass in front of him.|$|E

The next shot features a battleship—the video then cuts to a small boy playing with a toy ship in the bath before joints of meat on hooks are seen moving {{from right to left}} through a tiled room spattered with blood. A shot of a military commander on horseback addressing his troops appears before the second chorus which again features a guitarist <b>singing</b> <b>along</b> as he walks down spiral stairs.|$|E
