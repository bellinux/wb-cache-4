40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to analyse}} {{the rise and}} institutionalization of the {{discourse}} of strategic management. It seeks to advance an agenda for <b>studying</b> <b>strategy</b> from a sociologically informed perspective. Moreover, it aims {{to make a case}} for a critically informed, interdisciplinary approach to <b>studying</b> <b>strategy.</b> Design/methodology/approach – The paper provides an overview to <b>studying</b> <b>strategy</b> critically. It is a theoretically informed paper. Findings – The findings can be summarised as: first, strategy emerged as a major discipline in the 1970 s; second, as a body of knowledge strategy has remained close to its industrial economics origins; and third, an agenda for the sociological <b>study</b> of <b>strategy</b> revolving around concerns of performativity and power is outlined. Originality/value – The paper offers a sociologically informed account of strategy. Accounting, Management power, Management strategy, Performativity, Politics...|$|R

40|$|Mixed {{methods were}} adopted {{to explore the}} effects of student-generated {{visualization}} on paper and on computers as a <b>study</b> <b>strategy</b> for middle school science concept learning. In a post-test-only-control-group design, scores were compared among a control-group (n= 28), a group that was trained to visualize on paper (n= 30), and a group that was trained to visualize on computers (n= 34). The paper group and the computer group performed significantly better on the post-test than the control group. Visualization as a <b>study</b> <b>strategy</b> had positive effects whether students used paper or computers to generate their visualizations. However, no significant difference existed between the paper group and the computer group’s scores. Qualitative results indicated that students who were trained to visualize on paper or on computers had positive attitudes toward the use of visualization as a <b>study</b> <b>strategy,</b> and they engaged more in purposeful tasks during study time than the control group. However, several participants in the computer group felt negatively {{about the use of}} visualization; they claimed that visualization demanded too much time and effort.

5000|$|An {{observational}} {{study of how}} students study at home examined student study habits and <b>study</b> <b>strategies.</b> The results showed that most students prefer to task-switch a lot and focus for only approximately 6 minutes before reaching for their favourite digital device. Moreover, the students who enjoyed task-switching did so more often and with more technologies in comparison to students who preferred {{to focus on a}} single learning task, and who therefore did not have as many technologies readily available. Consistent with previous studies, students with a preference for focusing and those who used proper <b>study</b> <b>strategies</b> had higher GPA than students who preferred to task-switch.Karpinksi and colleagues (2013) compared multitasking behaviours in students from Europe to students from the U.S. They found that only the students from the U.S. were distracted by multitasking to the point that their GPA suffered. This was due to two main reasons: the U.S. students multitasked more than European students and the European students, when engaging in multitasking, were more strategic in their multitasking behaviour as they delayed replying to incoming messages. The concept of [...] "digital metacognition"—awareness of one's usage of and the effects of digital devices—has been proposed as a construct for providing a way to avoid problems with media multitasking while learning.|$|E
40|$|Watkins, LeCompte, and Kim (2000) {{suggested}} that the recall advantage for rare words in mixed lists {{is due to a}} compensatory <b>study</b> <b>strategy</b> that favors the rare words.

The present study investigated the possibility that the rare-word advantage in recognition memory is also the result of a compensatory <b>study</b> <b>strategy.</b> Experiment 1 replicated the findings of Watkins et al. that the rareword advantage in recall is eliminated under incidental learning conditions. In contrast, Experiment 2 showed that the rare-word advantage in recognition memory is maintained under both intentional and incidental learning conditions. Experiment 3 replicated the results of Experiments 1 and 2 using different stimuli and a different orienting task. Finally, Experiment 4 showed that the rare-word advantage in recognition is maintained with pure lists. These findings show that the rare-word advantage in recognition memory is not the result of a compensatory <b>study</b> <b>strategy.</b> Instead, rare words are encoded more distinctively than common words, irrespective of participants' intention to remember them...|$|R

Presentation at plenary meeting Learning & Cogntion, Heerlen, The Netherlands. Pauline Reijners started as a PhD-candidate in August 2011 under the supervision of Prof. Paul A.

Her research focuses on the effects of the ‘read-recite-review’ <b>study</b> <b>strategy</b> with adjunct questions on learning from expository texts. In the first experiment, which will take place at the KU Leuven, Pauline investigates under which conditions (comprehension questions versus factual questions; alignment or no alignment; control group) the 3 R strategy is most effective. The participants in the four intervention groups will answer either factual questions or comprehension questions after reading and during recitation. The participants in the control group will make notes during reading and free recall during the recitation phase. One week after the study phase, a post test will give insight in what the participants in the different conditions actually remember and comprehend from the text.
