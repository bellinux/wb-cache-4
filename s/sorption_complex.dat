The research concerned determination of composition of exchangeable cations and basic saturation. In the analysed soils, lithologic discontinuities in the profile structure were observed. The calcareous sinter located in {{the lower part of}} the profile caused characteristic water properties and occurrence of gleyic process. The investigated soil profiles were varied in their morphological structure and physicochemical properties. Fluctuations in the content of carbonates, organic mater and non-carbonate mineral sub-stance confirmed the existence of several cycles in the formation of these soils. The basic saturation (S) of the analysed soils ranged between 287. 4 and 2238. 7 mmol(+) kg– 1. The highest values were detected in gytia horizons (gyd), and the lowest ones- in gleyic hori-zons (G). The dominant cation in <b>sorption</b> <b>complex</b> of all horizons was calcium, and its highly differentiated content ranged from 245. 3 to 2089. 6 mmol(+) kg– 1.

Results of an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis showed that Eu(III) was chemically present within the near-surface of TiO 2 due to the formation of SOEu and SOHAEu complexes.

The study was based on chemical analysis of soil materials obtained from a two-year pot experiment. The factors of the study were: liming, fertilization with ammonium sulphate or calcium nitrate at two levels and fertilization with phosphorus in two doses. The obtained results indicated that liming as well as nitrogen forms influenced significantly the indica-tors of soil acidification. The use of CaCO 3 and nitrate nitrogen caused an increase of pH and decrease of hydrolytic acidity, exchangeable acidity and mobile aluminium.

At high surface coverage, the dominant complex types on Fh and Hm are bidentate mononuclear edge-sharing (2 E) and bidentate binuclear corner-sharing (2 C), with As-Fe distances of 2. 90 ± 0. 05 and 3. 35 ± 0. 05 Å, respectively.

The sorption process constitutes a change in elemental fate. Partitioning of an element from solution to a solid phase, or sorption, can be divided into three broad categories: adsorption, surface precipitation, and absorption. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), a type of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), offers the possibility for distinguishing among different modes of sorption by characterizing the atomic environment of the sorbing element.

40|$|International audienceThe {{mobility}} {{and availability of}} the toxic metalloid selenium in the environment is largely controlled by sorption and redox reactions, which may proceed at temporal scales {{similar to that of}} subsurface water movement under saturated or unsaturated conditions. Since such waters are often anaerobic and rich in Fe 2 +, we investigated the long-term (≤ 1 month) kinetics of selenite (Se(IV) O 3 -) sorption to montmorillonite in the presence of Fe 2 + under anoxic conditions. A synthetic montmorillonite was used to eliminate the influence of structural Fe. In the absence of aqueous Fe 2 +, selenite was sorbed as outer-sphere <b>sorption</b> <b>complex,</b> covering only part of the positive edge sites, as verified by a structure-based MUSIC model and Se K-edge XAS (X-ray absorption spectroscopy). When selenite was added to montmorillonite previously equilibrated with Fe 2 + solution however, slow reduction of Se and formation of a solid phase was observed with Se K-edge XANES (x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy) and EXAFS (extended x-ray absorption finestructure) spectroscopy. Iterative transformation factor analysis of XANES and EXAFS spectra suggested that only one Se reaction product formed, which was identified as nano-particulate Se(0). Even after one month, only 75 % of the initially sorbed Se(IV) was reduced to this solid species. Mössbauer spectrometry revealed that before and after addition and reduction of Se, 5 % of total sorbed Fe occurred as Fe(III) species on edge sites of montmorillonite (≈ 2 mmol kg- 1). The only change observed after addition of Se was the formation of a new Fe(II) species (15 %) attributed to the formation of an outer-sphere Fe(II) -Se <b>sorption</b> <b>complex.</b> The combined Mössbauer and XAS results hence clearly suggest that the Se and Fe redox reactions are not directly coupled. Based on the results of a companion paper, we hypothesize that the electrons produced in the absence of Se by oxidation of sorbed Fe(II) are stored, for example by formation of surface H 2 species, and are then 3 available for the later Se(IV) reduction. The slow reaction rate indicates a diffusion controlled process. Homogeneous precipitation of an iron selenite was thermodynamically predicted and experimentally observed only in the absence of clay. Interestingly, half of Fe was oxidized in this precipitate (Mössbauer). Since DFT calculations predicted the oxidation of Fe at the water-FeSe solid interface only and not in the bulk phase, the average particle size of this precipitate does not exceed 2 nm. A comparison with the Mössbauer and XAS spectra of the clay samples demonstrates that such homogenous precipitation can be excluded as a mechanism for the observed slow Se reduction, emphasizing the role of abiotic, heterogeneous precipitation and reduction for the removal of Se from subsurface waters...|$|E

Sorption dynamics and isotherms were studied using the batch equilibrium method. The sorption kinetics was relatively slow, and the sorption equilibrium can be reached within 10 h. In the designed concentration range of DBSA in this work, the maximum DBSA sorption capacities on the Alluvial soil HA (AHA) and the Mollisol soil HA (MHA) were 115. 0 and 112. 2 mg/g, respectively, which were higher than those of the Alluvial soil (AS) and Mollisol soil (MS).

40|$|Processes {{governing}} {{the formation of}} rare earth element (REE) composition are under consideration for ferromanganese deposits (nodules, separate parts of nodules, and micronodules of different size fractions) within the Clarion-Clipperton ore province in the Pacific Ocean. It is shown that ferromanganese oxyhydroxide deposits with different chemical compositions can be produced in sediments under similar sedimentation conditions. In areas with high bioproductivity size of micronodules has positive correlation with Mn content and Mn/Fe and P/Fe ratios and negative correlation with Fe, P, REE, and Ce anomaly. Behavior of REE in micronodules from sediments within bioproductive zones is related to increase of influence of diagenetic processes in sediments {{as a response to}} the growth of size of micronodules. Distinctions in chemical composition of micronodules and nodules are related to their interaction with associated sediments. Micronodules grow in sediments using hydrogenous ferromanganese oxyhydroxides. As they grow, micronodules are enriched in labile fraction of sediments reworked during diagenesis. Sources of material of ferromanganese nodules are governed by their formation at the water bottom interface. Their upper part is formed by direct settling of iron oxyhydroxides from bottom water, whereas the lower part is accumulated due to diagenetic processes in sediments. Differences of REE compositions in ferromanganese deposits are caused by the reduction of manganese during diagenesis and its separation from iron. Iron oxyhydroxides form a <b>sorption</b> <b>complex</b> due to sorption of phosphate-ion from bottom and pore waters. Sorption of phosphate-ion results in additional sorption of REE...|$|E
40|$|Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii /Mirb. / Franco) is {{currently}} {{considered one of}} the most important introduced tree species in Europe; for example in Germany it is considered domesticated. By its production it surpasses significantly our domestic softwood and its importance is found both in amelioration and improving functions as well as in its ability to compensate for spruce, so far our most common species however retreating somewhere. The work addresses the growth processes of individuals and stands of Douglas- fir and its selected environmental effects in regions of Kostelec nad Černými lesy, and Písek. The aim is to demonstrate the production potential, economic evaluation, describe the growth dynamics and the impact on soil quality in the stands. The methods applied will include dendrometric measurement, description of growth dynamics, profitability, sampling and analysis of humus and mineral soil horizons. Basic pedochemical characteristics will be analyzed: soil reaction, soil <b>sorption</b> <b>complex,</b> nutrient content in total and exchangeable forms. The results indicated a high produce ability of Douglas fir comparable to the one of Grand fir and exceeding the one of Norway spruce. In terms of stabilization and effects on soil also has better properties than spruce. In terms of amelioration resemble the qualities of deciduous trees. The work follows on previous experimental investigation [...] The output provides quantification of the production and soilforming potential, yield assessment and recommendations for application in conditions of the University Forest Enterprise and the Czech Republic...|$|E
40|$|The study {{deals with}} {{evaluation}} of a liming experiment carried out in spruce stands situated near Bílý Kříž in Moravian-Silesian Beskydy Mts. {{at an altitude of}} 908 m. Soil type was humo-ferric podzol with mor-moder humus form and low content of nutrients. Soil properties and soil solution composition from two research plots with Picea abies [L. ] Karst. monoculture aged 28 in 2006 were compared. One of the plots was limed by dolomitic limestone at a total dose of 9 t ha- 1 in the 80 s of the 20 t h century the second plot was a not-limed control. Sampling of sub-surface seepage water was carried out in fortnight intervals on the both plots during 2001 [...] 2006. Statistically significant differences between the limed and control plot were found in soil solution concentrations of Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Na +, K+, NH 4 +, HPO 4 2 -, SO 4 2 -, disolved organic carbon (DOC) and pH. Significant differences were not observed between the plots in NO 3 - concentrations. Soil samples taken from the both plots in 2003 were analyzed and the results have shown that changes induced by liming could be detected even after 16 year after the last liming event. Increased pH values in the entire soil profile, and changes in the composition of soil <b>sorption</b> <b>complex</b> and increased base saturation in the forest floor horizons were found on the limed plot...|$|E

Since the relaxational {{swelling of the}} polymer matrix that is observed at elevated gas concentrations takes hours or days, the swelling process is orders of magnitudes too slow to simulate the respective molecular dynamics in reasonable time and effort. To address this apparent incompatibility of experiment and simulation, we use single representative reference states from experiment and construct atomistic packing models according to these specifications. Gas sorption of CO 2 and CH 4 was successfully calculated on polysulfone, a 6 FDA-polyimide, and a polymer of intrinsic microporosity, PIM- 1, at 308 K and pressures up to 50 bar...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{knowledge}} of arsenic speciation {{at the surface}} of green rusts (GRs), [FeII (1 -x) FeIII x (OH) 2]x+(CO 3, Cl,SO 4) x-, is environmentally relevant because arsenic sorption onto GRs could contribute to arsenic retention in anoxic environments (hydromorphic soils, marine sediments, etc.). The nature of arsenic adsorption complexes on hydroxychloride green rust 1 (GR 1 Cl) at nearneutral pH under anoxic conditions was investigated using extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy at the As K-edge. Sorption data indicate that As(V) sorbs more efficiently than As(III) at the studied As loadings (0. 27 μmolm- 2 and 2. 7 μmolm- 2). EXAFS results indicate that arsenite [As(III) ] and arsenate [As(V) ] form inner-sphere complexes {{on the surface of}} GR 1 Cl at arsenic surface coverages of 0. 27 and 2. 70 μmolm- 2, with distinct types of As(III) and As(V) <b>sorption</b> <b>complexes,</b> which change in relative concentration as a function of arsenic loading. For As(V), the EXAFS-derived As-Fe distances (3. 34 (0. 02 and 3. 49 (0. 02 Å) suggest the presence of binuclear bidentate double-corner complexes (2 C) and monodentate mononuclear corner-sharing complexes (1 V). For As(III), EXAFS-derived As-As distance (3. 32 (0. 02 Å) and As-Fe distances (3. 49 (0. 02 and 4. 72 (0. 02 Å) are consistent with the presence of dimers of As(III) pyramids binding to the edges of the GR 1 Cl layers by corner sharing with FeO 6 octahedra. However, 2 C and 1 V As(III) complexes cannot be excluded. These results improve our {{knowledge of}} the mode of As(V) and As(III) inner-sphere adsorption on green rusts, which will help to constrain sorption modeling of arsenic in soils, sediments, and aquifers...|$|R
40|$|Previous spectroscopic {{research}} {{suggested that}} uranium(VI) adsorption to iron oxides {{is dominated by}} ternary uranyl-carbonato surface complexes across an unexpectedly wide pH range. Formation of such complexes {{would have a significant}} impact on the sorption behavior and mobility of uranium in aqueous environments. We therefore reinvestigated the identity and structural coordination of uranyl <b>sorption</b> <b>complexes</b> using a combination of U LIII-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy and iterative transformation factor analysis, which enhances the resolution in comparison to conventional EXAFS analysis. A range of conditions (pH, CO 2 partial pressure, ionic strength) made it possible to quantify the variations in surface speciation. In the resulting set of spectral data (N = 11) the variance is explained by only two components, which represent two structurally different types of surface complexes: (1) a binary uranyl surface complex with a bidentate coordination to edges of Fe(O,OH) 6 octahedra and (2) a uranyl triscarbonato surface complex where one carbonate ion bridges uranyl to the surface. This ternary type B complex differs from a type A complex where uranyl is directly attached to surface atoms and carbonate is bridged by uranyl to the surface. Both surface complexes agree qualitatively and quantitatively with predictions by a charge distribution (CD) model. According to this model the edge-sharing uranyl complex has equatorial ligands (-OH 2, -OH, or one -CO 3 group) that point away from the surface. The monodentate uranyl triscarbonato surface complex (type B) is relevant only at high pH and elevated pCO 2. At these conditions, however, it is responsible for significant uranyl sorption, whereas standard models would predict only weak sorption. This paper presents the first spectroscopic evidence of this ternary surface complex, which has significant implications for immobilization of uranyl in carbonate-rich aqueous environment...|$|R
