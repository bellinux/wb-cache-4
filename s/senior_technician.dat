25|$|The Left Bipod Foam Ramp is an {{approximately}} three-foot (one-meter) long aerodynamic component made {{entirely of}} foam. The foam, not normally {{considered to be}} a structural material, is required to bear some aerodynamic loads. Because of these special requirements, the casting-in-place and curing of the ramps may be performed only by a <b>senior</b> <b>technician.</b> The bipod ramp (having left and right sides) was originally designed to reduce aerodynamic stresses around the bipod attachment points at the external tank, but it was proven unnecessary {{in the wake of the}} accident and was removed from the external tank design for tanks flown after STS-107 (another foam ramp along the liquid oxygen line was also later removed from the tank design to eliminate it as a foam debris source, after analysis and tests proved this change safe).|$|E
