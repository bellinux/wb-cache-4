40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{historical}} development of the concept of the <b>sport</b> <b>at</b> the Olympics. Compares {{the pros and cons of}} the professionalization of the <b>sport</b> <b>at</b> the Olympics and analyzes the reasons, why the rules changed. It describes a long way in the development of Olympic sport and focuses on the historical events leading up to the actual professionalization of the <b>sport</b> <b>at</b> the Olympics.
