40|$|Hydrogen <b>sulphide</b> is a {{toxicant}} naturally {{produced in}} hypoxic marine sediments, hydrocarbon and brine seeps and hydrothermal vents. The California killifish, a salt marsh resident, is remarkably tolerant of <b>sulphide.</b> The 50 % lethal concentration is 700 Î¼M total <b>sulphide</b> in 96 h, and 5 mM in 8 h (determined in flow-through, oxygenated sea water). Killifish exposed to <b>sulphide</b> produce thiosulphate which accumulates in the blood. The cytochrome c oxidase (a major site of toxicity) of the killifish is 50 % inhibited by < 1 Î¼M <b>sulphide.</b> Killifish liver mitochondria are poisoned by 50 â€“ 75 Î¼M <b>sulphide</b> but can oxidize 10 â€“ 20 Î¼M <b>sulphide</b> to thiosulphate. <b>Sulphide</b> causes sulphhaemoglobin formation (and impairment of oxygen transport) at 1 â€“ 5 mM in vitro {{and to a}} small extent at 2 mM in vivo. Killifish blood neither catalyses <b>sulphide</b> oxidation significantly nor binds <b>sulphide</b> at environmental (low) <b>sulphide</b> concentrations. Exposure to 200 Î¼M and 700 Î¼M <b>sulphide</b> over several days causes significant increases in lactate concentrations, indicating shift to anaerobic glycolysis. However, individuals with the most lactate die. In terms of diffusible H 2 S, the killifish can withstand concentrations two to three orders of magnitude greater than would poison cytochrome c oxidase. The high <b>sulphide</b> tolerance of the killifish, particularly of concentrations typical of salt marshes, can be explained chiefly by mitochondrial <b>sulphide</b> oxidation. <b>Sulphide</b> tolerance and mitochondrial <b>sulphide</b> oxidation in the killifish have a constitutive basis, i. e. do not diminish in fish held in the laboratory in sulphide-free water for 1 â€“ 2 months, and are improved by prior acclimation...|$|R

40|$|Metal <b>sulphide</b> {{precipitation}} {{forms an}} important component of acid mine drainage remediation systems based on bacterial sulphate reduction. However, the precipitation reaction is inherently driven by very high levels of supersaturation with the generation of small particles with poor solid–liquid separation characteristics. In this study, the effect of strategies used to manage supersaturation was investigated during copper and zinc <b>sulphide</b> precipitation reactions. Initial batch studies showed the origin of <b>sulphide</b> (biological or chemical) had no significant effect on the efficiency of zinc <b>sulphide</b> precipitation. For copper, low metal removal efficiency was obtained at metal to <b>sulphide</b> molar ratios below 1. 6 in the synthetic <b>sulphide</b> system. This was improved in the biogenic <b>sulphide</b> system, due to the presence of residual volatile fatty acids, but {{the presence or absence of}} particulate organic matter had no effect on recovery. Subsequent studies, conducted using synthetic <b>sulphide</b> solutions in a seeded fluidised bed reactor with multiple reagent feed points (2 FP and 6 FP) and different recirculation flow rates (300 and 120 mL min− 1) showed efficient zinc <b>sulphide</b> precipitation, but limited (< 10 %) deposition on the seeds. Increasing the number of <b>sulphide</b> feed points (2 – 6) reduced precipitate loss as fines by approximately 10 %. Zinc <b>sulphide</b> fines could be effectively recovered from suspension by settling under quiescent conditions. In the copper system, metal recovery was low (ca 40 %) due to the formation of very small copper <b>sulphide</b> particles (mean particle size of ca 0. 01 μm). Increasing the number of reagent feed points did not affect supersaturation to the extent of altering particle characteristics. The copper <b>sulphide</b> fines could not be recovered by settling, remaining in a stable colloidal suspension due to their highly charged surfaces (zeta potential − 50 mV). The change in recirculation flow rate had a limited effect (ca 5 % improvement) on process efficiency. The results show that the extremely high supersaturation prevalent during metal <b>sulphide</b> precipitation is difficult to control using conventional approaches and suggest that the seeded fluidised bed reactor is not suitable for this application...|$|R
30|$|In this study, we have {{examined}} the adsorption of hydrogen <b>sulphide</b> and carbon monoxide over rhodium/silica and rhodium/alumina catalysts. Adsorption of hydrogen <b>sulphide</b> was measured at 293 and 873  K and at 873  K in a 1 : 1 ratio with hydrogen. At 293  K, over Rh/silica, hydrogen <b>sulphide</b> adsorption capacity {{was similar to that}} of carbon monoxide; however, over Rh/alumina, the carbon monoxide adsorption capacity was higher, probably due to the formation of RhI(CO) 2. Over Rh/silica, the primary adsorbed state was HS(ads), in contrast to Rh/alumina, where the H 2 :S ratio was 1 : 1 indicating that the adsorbed state was S(ads). Competitive adsorption between CO and H 2 S over Rh/silica and Rh/alumina revealed adsorption sites on the metal that only adsorbed carbon monoxide, only adsorbed hydrogen <b>sulphide</b> or could adsorb both species. At 873  K, hydrogen <b>sulphide</b> adsorption produced the bulk <b>sulphide</b> Rh 2 S 3; however, when a 1 : 1 H 2 :H 2 S mixture was used formation of the bulk <b>sulphide</b> was inhibited and a reduced amount of hydrogen <b>sulphide</b> was adsorbed.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a new process for biotechnological <b>sulphide</b> removal from wastewater, in which it is attempted to convert <b>sulphide</b> into elemental sulphur by colourless sulphur bacteria. The toxicity, corrosive properties, unpleasant odor and high oxygen demand of <b>sulphide</b> dictate stringent control of its release into the environment. The goals of the research were: development an efficient and reliable high rate treatment system for purification of <b>sulphide</b> containing wastewaters and assessment of the conditions that promote sulphur instead of sulphate formation. The newly developed biotechnological <b>sulphide</b> removal system accomplishes a removal rate and efficiency which at least is similar to that of other <b>sulphide</b> removal systems, which are based on the oxidation with air. Application of the system is possible in the pH range 6. 5 - 9. 0 and in a temperature range of approximately 15 - 40 °C. At least two types of <b>sulphide</b> oxidizing bacteria were found, viz. a sulphate producing (type A) and a sulphur producing bacteria (type B). Type A is inhibited by <b>sulphide</b> and type B by oxygen. As the conversion of <b>sulphide</b> into sulphur is the main aim of the system, growth of type B should be stimulated. This can be accomplished by imposing high <b>sulphide</b> loading rates (> 200 mg/l. h) and maintaining low oxygen concentrations (&lt; 4 mg/l). The growth yield of type B (0. 3 g DS/mol S) is lower than that of type A (3 g DS/mol S), and therefore little biological sludge will be produced when sulphur is the end-product. The start-up of the system is fast, viz. 5 days in a CSTR (1 % inoculum), when applying a <b>sulphide</b> influent concentration of 100 mg/l and a HRT of 22 minutes. The oxygen concentration should not exceed 4 mg/l, because inhibition of type B should be prevented. The noncatalyzed chemical <b>sulphide</b> oxidation (at oxygen concentration 4 mg/l) is considerably slower (75 times) than the biological <b>sulphide</b> oxidation at <b>sulphide</b> concentrations below 10 mg/l and about a factor 6 at <b>sulphide</b> concentrations up to 600 mg/l. In a <b>sulphide</b> reactor merely two groups of unwanted bacteria can develop, viz. bacteria that store the sulphur inside the cell and cause sludge bulking problems, like Thiothrix and bacteria that produce <b>sulphide</b> like Desulfuromonasacetoxidans (sulphur reducer) and Desulfobulbuspropionicus (sulphate reducer). Both groups of bacteria can only develop, when organic compounds are present in the wastewater. The problems caused by unwanted bacteria can be minimized by applying high <b>sulphide</b> loading rates (prevention of Thiothrix growth) and a high rotation speed (prevention of the <b>sulphide</b> producing bacteria). The sulphur reducing bacteria, present in the sludge, can use acetate but not propionate, while the sulphate reducing bacteria use propionate but not acetate. When the newly developed process is applied on anaerobically treated papermill wastewater using a biorotor reactor, a removal rate of 620 mg/l. h) at a removal efficiency of 95 % is found at a HRT of 13 minutes, while only 8 % of the <b>sulphide</b> is converted to sulphate...|$|R
