5|$|A {{contact angle}} less than 90° (low contact angle) usually {{indicates}} that wetting {{of the surface}} is very favorable, and the fluid will <b>spread</b> <b>over</b> a large area of the surface. Contact angles greater than 90° (high contact angle) generally means that wetting of the surface is unfavorable, so the fluid will minimize contact with the surface and form a compact liquid droplet.|$|E

5|$|The two Meare Lake Villages within Meare Pool {{appear to}} {{originate}} from {{a collection of}} structures erected {{on the surface of}} the dried peat, such as tents, windbreaks and animal folds. Clay was later <b>spread</b> <b>over</b> the peat, providing raised stands for occupation, industry and movement, and in some areas thicker clay spreads accommodated hearths built of clay or stone.|$|E
5|$|A new organ was {{supplied}} to the abbey in 1895 by Norman and Beard of Norwich. It had 52 stops <b>spread</b> <b>over</b> four manuals and pedals, and stood divided on two steel beams in the North and South crossing arches, with the console {{standing on the}} floor next to the north-west pier of the crossing. New cases were to be provided to designs by Brian Oliver of Bath, but were never executed. Norman & Beard re-erected it in a new case designed by Sir Thomas Jackson in the North Transept in 1914, with the addition of two stops to the Pedal.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{housing and}} land {{shortage}} existed in nearby Smethwick County Borough, which {{also resulted in}} the authority acquiring land from adjoining council areas. By 1914; the urban area of Bearwood had already <b>spread</b> <b>over</b> the border of Oldbury Urban District as far as Rathbone Road and Warley Park. A further adjustment of the county boundary took place in 1928 and on this occasion however, Staffordshire gained territory from Worcestershire at Warley Woods (See Fig 4). This enabled Smethwick to build new housing estates at Londonderry and {{to the west of}} Rathbone Road.|$|E

40|$|The {{spreading}} {{of solid}} powder over a liquid surface is a prevalent phenomenon encountered in many industrial {{processes such as}} food and pharmaceutical processes. The driving force for powder <b>spreading</b> <b>over</b> a liquid surface is not clearly understood. The Marangoni effect due to a temperature gradient and the spreading coefficient for solid powder over liquid (lambda S/L) have both been proposed as causes for powder <b>spreading</b> <b>over</b> liquids. The proposed lambda S/L {{was based on the}} same form of the spreading coefficient for a liquid over a solid surface (lambda L/S). Whereas lambda L/S has a clear thermodynamic definition, the spreading coefficient of solid powder over liquid, lambda S/L, which was defined by simply interchanging the subscripts of the interfacial energy terms, has not been thoroughly analysed. Our experimental results showed that the spreading behaviour of solid powders over liquids cannot be explained or predicted by lambda S/L. In this study we focus on problems associated with the lambda S/L. Through a thermodynamic analysis we conclude that the existing parameter lambda S/L is unable to predict the spreading behaviour of solid powder on liquid surface, since the interfacial energy approach does not capture the actual physical process of powder <b>spreading</b> <b>over</b> liquid surface. A closer examination of the powder spreading process reveals the fundamental different between liquid <b>spreading</b> <b>over</b> solid surface and solid powder <b>spreading</b> <b>over</b> liquid. This work shows that further research is required to identify and analyse the physical mechanisms which are responsible for powder particles <b>spreading</b> <b>over</b> liquid surfaces...|$|R
5|$|After about 10 days (1–3 weeks {{depending}} on temperatures), larvae hatch and bore directly throughout the pod walls and develop within the seed. Larvae are thus protected from {{biological and chemical}} control. Larval development lasts two to three months. Before entering its pupal stage, the larva cuts a circular cap. After around ten days of pupal stage, the adult emerges from the seeds. Because mating and oviposition are <b>spread</b> <b>over</b> a few weeks, adults can emerge before or after harvest.|$|E

The three routes, <b>spread</b> <b>over</b> many miles {{in the southern part of}} the state, run through a narrow corridor for two miles (3km) until Routes9 and 22 veer east again toward Keeseville.|$|E
5|$|Basset's lands did {{not form}} a compact estate, {{as they were}} <b>spread</b> <b>over</b> 11 counties. In 1135, Basset's lands totalled 184.25 carucates of land, and were later {{considered}} 15 knight's fees. In Leicestershire, Basset held most of the lands held by Robert de Buci {{at the time of}} the Domesday Survey of 1086. The lands were held by Basset of the king by right of his wife, but how the lands had passed into her family is unclear. In addition, Basset held land in Leicestershire from both King David I of Scotland and from Robert de Beaumont, the Earl of Leicester.|$|E
