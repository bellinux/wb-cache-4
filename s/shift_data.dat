Data streams are generated from events of real world so existence of associations, which are among the occurrence of these events in real world, among concepts of data streams is logical. Extraction of these hidden associations can be useful for prediction of subsequent concepts in concept <b>shifting</b> <b>data</b> streams. In this paper we present a new method for learning association among concepts of data stream and prediction of what the next concept will be.

50|$|For {{measurements}} of chemical forces {{the effect of}} the long range van der Waals forces must be subtracted from the frequency <b>shift</b> <b>data.</b> Originally this was done by fitting a power law to the long range 'tail' of the spectrum (when the tip is far from the surface) and extrapolating this over the short range interaction (tip close to the surface). This fitting, however, is very sensitive to where the cut-off between long and short range forces is chosen, causing results of questionable accuracy. Usually the most appropriate method is to perform two spectroscopy measurements, one over any molecule under study, and a second above a lower section of the clean surface, then to directly subtract the second from the first. This method is not applicable to features under study on a flat surface as no lower section may exist.|$|E

5000|$|The {{chemical}} shift index or CSI {{is a widely}} employed technique in protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy {{that can be used}} to display and identify the location (i.e. start and end) as well as the type of protein secondary structure (beta strands, helices and random coil regions) found in proteins using only backbone chemical <b>shift</b> <b>data</b> [...] The technique was invented by Dr. David Wishart in 1992 for analyzing 1Hα {{chemical shift}}s and then later extended by him in 1994 to incorporate 13C backbone shifts. The original CSI method makes use of the fact that 1Hα chemical shifts of amino acid residues in helices tends to be shifted upfield (i.e. towards the right side of a NMR spectrum) relative to their random coil values and downfield (i.e. towards the left side of a NMR spectrum) in beta strands. Similar kinds of upfield/downfiled trends are also detectable in backbone 13C chemical shifts.|$|E
50|$|The clearest {{experimental}} evidence against electrostatic substituent effects {{was reported by}} Rashkin and Waters. They used meta- and para-substituted N-benzyl-2-(2-fluorophenyl)-pyridinium bromides, which stack in a parallel displaced conformation, as a model system for pi stacking interactions. In their system, a methylene linker prohibits favorable T-shaped interactions. As in previous models, the relative strength of pi stacking interactions was measured by NMR as the rate of rotation about the biaryl bond, as pi stacking interactions are disrupted in the transition state. Para-substituted rings had small rotational barriers which increased with increasingly electron-withdrawing groups, consistent with prior findings. However, meta-substituted rings had much larger barriers of rotation despite having nearly identical electron densities in the aromatic ring. The authors explain this discrepancy as direct interaction of the edge of hydrogen atoms of one ring with the electronegative substituents on the other ring. This claim is supported by chemical <b>shift</b> <b>data</b> of the proton in question.|$|E
5000|$|The CSI {{method is}} not without some shortcomings. In particular, its {{performance}} drops if chemical shift assignments are mis-referenced or incomplete. It is also quite sensitive to the choice of random coil shifts {{used to calculate the}} secondary shifts and it generally identifies alpha helices (>85% accuracy) better than beta strands (<75% accuracy) regardless of the choice of random coil shifts. [...] Furthermore, the CSI method does not identify other kinds of secondary structures, such as β-turns. Because of these shortcomings, a number of alternative CSI-like approaches have been proposed. These include: 1) a prediction method that employs statistically derived chemical shift/structure potentials (PECAN); 2) a probabilistic approach to secondary structure identification (PSSI); 3) a method that combines secondary structure predictions from sequence data and chemical <b>shift</b> <b>data</b> (PsiCSI), 4) a secondary structure identification approach that uses pre-specified chemical shift patterns (PLATON) and 5) a two-dimensional cluster analysis method known as 2DCSi. The performance of these newer methods is generally slightly better (2-4%) than the original CSI method.|$|E

5000|$|PREDITOR (PREDIction of TORsion angles) is a freely {{available}} web-server for {{the prediction}} of protein torsion angles from chemical shifts. For many years it has been known that protein chemical shifts are sensitive to protein secondary structure, which in turn, is sensitive to backbone torsion angles. torsion angles are internal coordinates {{that can be used}} to describe the conformation of a polypeptide chain. They can also be used as constraints to help determine or refine protein structures via NMR spectroscopy. In proteins there are four major torsion angles of interest: phi, psi, omega and chi-1. Traditionally protein NMR spectroscopists have used vicinal J-coupling information and the Karplus relation to determine approximate backbone torsion angle constraints for phi and chi-1 angles. However, several studies in the early 1990s pointed out the strong relationship between 1H and 13C chemical shifts and torsion angles, especially with backbone phi and psi angles. Later a number of other papers pointed out additional chemical shift relationships with chi-1 and even omega angles. PREDITOR was designed to exploit these experimental observations and to help NMR spectroscopists easily predict protein torsion angles from chemical shift assignments. Specifically, PREDITOR accepts protein sequence and/or chemical <b>shift</b> <b>data</b> as input and generates torsion angle predictions for phi, psi, omega and chi-1 angles. The algorithm that PREDITOR uses combines sequence alignment, chemical shift alignment and a number of related chemical shift analysis techniques to predict torsion angles. PREDITOR is unusually fast (<40 s per protein) and exhibits a very high level of accuracy. In a series of tests 88% of PREDITOR’s phi/psi predictions were within 30 degrees of the correct values, 84% of chi-1 predictions (3-state predictions) were correct and 99.97% of PREDITOR’s predicted omega angles were correct. PREDITOR also estimates the torsion angle errors so that its torsion angle constraints can be used with standard protein structure refinement software, such as CYANA, CNS, XPLOR and AMBER. PREDITOR also supports automated protein chemical shift re-referencing and {{the prediction of}} proline cis/trans states. PREDITOR is not the only torsion angle prediction software available. Several other computer programs including TALOS, TALOS+ [...] and DANGLE [...] have also been developed to predict backbone torsion angles from protein chemical shifts. These stand-alone programs exhibit similar prediction performance to PREDITOR but are substantially slower.|$|E
