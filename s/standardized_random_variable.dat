40|$|Skewness of {{financial}} time series is a relevant topic, {{due to its}} implications for portfolio theory and for statistical inference. In the univariate case, its default measure is the third cumulant of the <b>standardized</b> <b>random</b> <b>variable.</b> It can be generalized to the third multivariate cumulant that is a matrix containing all centered moments of order three which {{can be obtained from}} a random vector.

Amultivariate skew-GARCH model. Advances in Econometrics 20 : 33 – 57]. In the first place, it allows for parsimonious modelling of multivariate skewness. In the second place, all its elements are either null or negative, consistently with previous empirical and theoretical findings.

40|$|Many {{engineering}} {{applications are}} characterized by the innate challenge of acquiring experimental data. This lack of available data hampers {{the selection of the}} probability density function (PDF) and introduces a level of arbitrariness in the ensuing risk analysis. This paper presents an approach to estimate the uncertainty in the PDF shape. A multiparameter family of candidate PDF shapes is used and the statistical uncertainty associated with the PDF parameters is estimated from the data. Several popular PDF families as well as multiple parameter estimation methods are presented. The confidence bounds on the parameters can be computed and input in commonly used advanced reliability analysis tool to estimate the uncertainty in the computed risk. Practical examples illustrate the approach.
