In response to this engineering travesty, San Francisco's city attorney has decided to file a lawsuit against the developer because the developer failed to inform the residents of the accelerated speed that the building was sinking at.

Potts said, [...] "The purchase of this building will enable the Philadelphia National Bank more adequately and efficiently to support the large-scale industrial and commercial expansion under way in this city." [...] The bank <b>spent</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> dollars modernizing the building and converting the former department store floors to banking space.

500|$|Cyan Worlds and Mattel (then {{the owner}} of the Myst and Riven franchise) offered the task of {{developing}} the sequel to several development companies; according to Game Developer, interested parties developed proposals including story concepts, analysis of the first two games, technology discussion, and technology demonstration. A core team from Presto Studios held discussions which analyzed Myst and Riven, then set out specific goals for the third game. According to Presto founder and producer Greg Uhler, these goals included visual variety in the Ages, a satisfying ending, and a way for players to gauge their progress during the game. The progress goal was very important for Uhler, who stated: [...] "Players who had failed to complete Myst or Riven did so because they were unsure of how much remained of the game and what their goals were." [...] Initially, Presto prepared three possible storylines for the game to follow; a meeting between Cyan, Presto, and Mattel yielded a completely different plot, which explored some of the loose ends hinted at in Myst. Presto <b>spent</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> U.S. dollars developing the game, using the studio's entire staff to complete the project. Development took two and a half years, of which nine months were spent on design and pre-production.|$|E

5000|$|The Fargo episode [...] "The Law of Non-Contradiction", {{which takes}} {{its name from}} the law, was noted for its several {{elements}} relating to the law of non-contradiction, as the episode's main character faces several paradoxes.

500|$|The {{environmental}} group Friends of the River (FOR) {{was formed in}} the early 1970s to push a statewide ballot measure, Proposition 17, which would have designated [...] of the Stanislaus River between Stanislaus Powerhouse and Parrott's Ferry as a National Wild and Scenic River and stopped the construction of New Melones Dam. Development-related interests such as PG, the California Chamber of Commerce and the contractors working on the dam <b>spent</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> dollars lobbying against Prop 17. One of their slogans, [...] "Stop the 'Wild River' Hoax!" [...] argued that {{this part of the}} Stanislaus River was not untouched wilderness (as dams already existed both upstream and downstream of the 9-mile segment) and therefore was ineligible for Wild and Scenic designation. This statement was misleading, since the language of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act does not disqualify rivers with dams – only the portions already inundated by reservoirs. Dam supporters also argued that the Stanislaus River in its natural state was only accessible to a small group of people; that the rafting companies held a [...] "monopoly" [...] on river recreation and a reservoir would open up the area for far more tourists than would have visited otherwise, bringing more economic benefits to the area.|$|E
