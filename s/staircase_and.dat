40|$|This Bachelor's {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} {{with a set of}} interior <b>staircases</b> <b>and</b> furniture steps related to house interior and its architectural setting. The main goal is to define the requirements for these <b>staircases</b> <b>and</b> furniture steps. In {{the first part of the}} thesis an analysis of contemporary situation in area of interior staircases is summarized, which {{is concerned with}} the relationship between <b>staircases,</b> house interior <b>and</b> the furniture. Then requirements for proportions and qualitative demands for interior <b>staircases</b> <b>and</b> furniture stairs are defined. In the discussion section the conclusions and findings about continuity between <b>staircases,</b> steps <b>and</b> furniture and the meaning of these relationships in practise are set out. An aim is to set requirements for the design of interior <b>staircases</b> <b>and</b> furniture steps in relation to furniture...|$|R

5|$|Among the few {{remains of}} {{buildings}} {{from the interior}} of the town, most notable are a large monumental <b>staircase</b> <b>and</b> a large church, with dimensions of some , in the northeast. The church was of relatively simple construction, but of unusual size, and A. Bon proposes its identification with the church of the Franciscans, where assemblies of the nobles of Achaea were held in 1276 and 1289. The remaining portions of the church's walls were completely destroyed by the German Army during the Occupation.|$|E
5|$|Spears {{talked to}} CNN about her {{involvement}} {{during the development}} of the tour, stating that she had designed the entire tour herself, including costumes and concept. Spears worked with fashion designer Gia Ventola to create the costumes for her and the dancers. The proscenium stage was simple and had only one main prop, a staircase in the middle. The band was in both sides of the <b>staircase</b> <b>and</b> consisted of five musicians. There were also six dancers, that took the stage during interludes. The setlist consisted of eight songs from her debut album and several covers by well-known artists.|$|E

5|$|The John Deere House {{was built}} in 1836 when Deere arrived in Grand Detour and the {{building}} was added onto as his family grew. It is furnished with period furniture and household objects {{that would have been}} common around the time the Deere family occupied the home. The house has two levels with four rooms on the main level and two rooms upstairs. Each of the upstairs rooms is accessible via a private <b>staircase</b> <b>and</b> it is believed one of the rooms was used by Deere's apprentices while the other was used as a children's bedroom.|$|E
5|$|The west façade of {{the castle}} has square towers {{flanking}} the central bay, with others at the south west and north west, all topped with octagonal, machicolated turrets. The north and south façades are relatively simple. The east façade has a central projection in the centre rising a storey above the parapet, to form a tower. The tower's south angle is splayed to accommodate the main <b>staircase</b> <b>and</b> only the corbels of its parapet survive. The screen closing off the east entrance has a three-bay cusped arcade {{on the ground floor}} and three ogee arches on the shafts above.|$|E
5|$|Catherine's {{earliest}} {{building project}} was the château of Montceaux-en-Brie, near Paris, which Henry II gave her in 1556, {{three years before}} his death. The building consisted of a central pavilion housing a straight <b>staircase,</b> <b>and</b> two wings with a pavilion at each end. Catherine wanted to cover the alley in the garden where Henry played pall mall, an early form of croquet. For this commission, Philibert de l'Orme built her a grotto. He set it on a base {{made to look like}} natural rock, from which guests could watch the games while taking refreshments. The work was completed in 1558 but has not survived. The château ceased {{to be used as a}} royal residence after 1640, and had fallen into ruin by the time it was demolished by revolutionary decree in 1798.|$|E

5|$|In 1864, Rodin {{began to}} live with a young {{seamstress}} named Rose Beuret (born in June 1844), with whom he would stay– with ranging commitment– {{for the rest of his}} life. The couple had a son, Auguste-Eugène Beuret (1866–1934). That year, Rodin offered his first sculpture for exhibition, and entered the studio of Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse, a successful mass producer of objets d'art. Rodin worked as Carrier-Belleuse' chief assistant until 1870, designing roof decorations and <b>staircase</b> <b>and</b> doorway embellishments. With the arrival of the Franco-Prussian War, Rodin was called to serve in the National Guard, but his service was brief due to his near-sightedness. Decorators' work had dwindled because of the war, yet Rodin needed to support his family; poverty was a continual difficulty for Rodin until about the age of 30. Carrier-Belleuse soon asked Rodin to join him in Belgium, where they would work on ornamentation for the Brussels Stock Exchange.|$|E

5|$|The Fuller Houses are two {{historic}} {{homes at}} 339-341 and 343-345 Broadway in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Constructed in 1896-1897, the two Queen Anne-styled homes were constructed as rental properties for the Fuller family and {{are believed to}} have originally been identical in construction. The -story houses are marked by an octagonal bay which contains the front <b>staircase</b> <b>and</b> a large two-story porch projecting almost completely from the house itself. For the National Register of Historic Places nomination only a single unit was examined, but the identical unit below is believed to have undergone minimal alterations. The other house, 343-345 Broadway, was not surveyed, but has been more seriously modified to allow for four apartment units. The Fuller Houses are architecturally significant as well-preserved and well-detailed Queen Anne-styled apartment flats. The Fuller Houses were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E
5|$|The filming in {{downtown}} Chicago {{was conducted on}} Sundays {{during the summer of}} 1979, and much of the downtown was cordoned off from the public. Costs for filming the largest scene in the city's history totaled $3.5 million. Permission was given after Belushi and Aykroyd offered to donate $50,000 to charity after filming. Although the Bluesmobile was allowed to be driven through the Daley Center lobby, special breakaway panes were temporarily substituted for the normal glass in the building. The speeding car caused $7,650 in damage to 35 granite paver stones and a bronze air grill in the building. Interior shots of the elevator, <b>staircase,</b> <b>and</b> assessor's office were all recreated in a film set for filming.|$|E
5|$|The {{first was}} floor was {{accessed}} via the main staircase, {{situated in the}} east tower. The first room encountered was the great hall, which rose three floors. To the viewer's immediate left was a kitchen (with clerestory lighting), and further on to the left was a butlery and pantry with a garderobe. To the viewer's back right was a small passage containing a private <b>staircase</b> <b>and</b> {{the entrance to the}} oratory (its roof vaulted with an east window) in the east tower. The oratory was entered via a five-and-a-half high pointed-arch doorway and contained an altar and piscina, of which only an ornamental niche remains. There was a fireplace on the north wall of the great hall and behind the north wall was the great chamber containing a fireplace, garderobe and a window seat on the east wall. To the west of the hall {{was the head of the}} west window. The portcullis is believed to have been raised into the hall in front of this window.|$|E

5|$|The {{plan for}} Prior Park was to {{construct}} five buildings along three {{sides of a}} dodecagon matching the sweep {{of the head of}} the valley, with the main building being flanked by elongated wings based on designs by Andrea Palladio. The plans were influenced by drawings in Vitruvius Britannicus originally made by Colen Campbell for Wanstead House in Essex, which was yet to be built. The main block had 15 bays and each of the wings 17 bays each. Between each wing and the main block was a Porte-cochère for coaches to stop under. In addition to the stone from the local quarries, material, including the grand <b>staircase</b> <b>and</b> plasterwork, from the demolished Hunstrete House were used in the construction.|$|E
5|$|The video follows Ciara as {{she goes}} clubbing. The clip begins with the singer waking up at midnight, in a black, {{reflective}} apartment, as she is dressed in black and proceeds to leave through the building's fire escape. When she arrives outside, {{the windows of the}} building brighten and fade, and the moon, stars, and lamp posts create a strobe effect. White reflectors on the street sweep around Ciara and she is surrounded by dancers, many of whom are from the film, as they ascend a dark <b>staircase</b> <b>and</b> enter the club. When everyone arrives on the roof, Ciara meets up with Chamillionaire for his verse, and thereafter Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan, the stars of Step Up, make appearances in dance sequences. The lights of the cityscape begin to pulse to the music, and rain falls on the crowd. Unilux strobes are used to highlight the rain.|$|E
5|$|There was a Tudor-style foyer on the 66th {{floor with}} oak paneling, {{and an old}} English-style grill room with wooden floors, wooden beams, wrought-iron chandeliers, and glass and lead doors. The main dining room, located on the 67th floor, was {{connected}} to the 66th floor by a Renaissance-style marble and bronze <b>staircase</b> <b>and</b> had a futuristic appearance, with polished granite columns and etched glass appliques in Art Deco style. There was a mural of a cloud on the roof, and a mural of Manhattan on the dining room's north side. It is believed that the dining room was a reference for the Rainbow Room and the Rockefeller Center Luncheon Club, both located at 30 Rockefeller Center. On the same floor, Walter Chrysler and Texaco both had private dining rooms. The 68th floor mainly contained service spaces.|$|E
