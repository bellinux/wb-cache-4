5|$|The Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta {{opened a}} gallery of Muppets {{exhibits}} within the Worlds of Puppetry exhibition at the Center in November 2015, a greatly <b>scaled-down</b> version of what was announced in 2007 {{to have been a}} wing honoring Henson.|$|E
5|$|Chrono Trigger {{features}} standard role-playing {{video game}} gameplay. The player controls the protagonist {{and his companions}} in the game's two-dimensional fictional world, consisting of various forests, cities, and dungeons. Navigation occurs via an overworld map, depicting the landscape from a <b>scaled-down</b> overhead view. Areas such as forests, cities, and similar places are depicted as more realistic <b>scaled-down</b> maps, in which players can converse with locals to procure items and services, solve puzzles and challenges, or encounter enemies. Chrono Triggers gameplay deviates from that of traditional Japanese RPGs in that, rather than appearing in random encounters, many enemies are openly visible on field maps or lie in wait to ambush the party. Contact with enemies on a field map initiates a battle that occurs directly on the map rather than on a separate battle screen.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, having {{acquired}} and {{been unable to}} successfully integrate a competing chain of electronics stores, Peterson {{filed for bankruptcy protection}} before reemerging as a <b>scaled-down</b> furniture retailer that offered minimal electronics. He continued appearing in his own commercials into the early 2000s, and the store's final location closed in February 2009.|$|E
5|$|An {{experimental}} Cub Scout Trainer Wood Badge was {{field tested}} in 1976. In 1978 the National Council decided in a half-step backwards that Wood Badge needed to place {{greater emphasis on}} the practical aspects of good troop operation along {{with a variety of}} leadership exercises. Wood Badge was adopted as the official advanced training program for adult Cub Scout Leaders. The modified course blended Scoutcraft skills and troop management practices along with <b>scaled-down</b> content about the leadership competencies.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} reissued, {{along with the}} rest of the Beatles catalogue, on compact disc in 1987. It was reissued again on CD in 1998 as part of a 30th anniversary series for EMI, {{featuring}} a <b>scaled-down</b> replication of the original artwork. This was part of a reissue series from EMI that included albums from other artists such as the Rolling Stones and Roxy Music. It was reissued again in 2009 in a new remastered edition.|$|E
5|$|The {{entrance}} to the substructure {{is located on the}} pyramid's northern side and consists of a descending passage leading to a T-shaped chamber. This chamber was located under the tip of the pyramid and is oriented on an east–west axis {{like the rest of the}} queen's pyramid complex. It has a pented roof made of large limestone blocks, a construction technique common to all pyramid chambers of the 5th dynasty. The substructure is thus a <b>scaled-down</b> version of Userkaf's without the magazines.|$|E
5|$|A {{national}} tour began in Cleveland, Ohio, in April 1950; it ran {{for five years}} and starred Richard Eastham as Emile, Janet Blair as Nellie and Ray Walston as Billis, a role Walston would reprise in London and in the 1958 film. For the 48,000 tickets available in Cleveland, 250,000 requests were submitted, causing the box office to close for three weeks to process them. Jeanne Bal and Iva Withers were later Nellies on this tour. A <b>scaled-down</b> version toured military bases in Korea in 1951; by the request of Hammerstein and Rodgers, officers and enlisted soldiers sat together to view it.|$|E
5|$|During 1971–72 Zappa {{released}} two strongly jazz-oriented solo LPs, Waka/Jawaka and The Grand Wazoo, {{which were}} recorded during the forced layoff from concert touring, using floating line-ups of session players and Mothers alumni. Musically, the albums were akin to Hot Rats, {{in that they}} featured extended instrumental tracks with extended soloing. Zappa began touring again in late 1972. His first effort {{was a series of}} concerts in September 1972 with a 20-piece big band referred to as the Grand Wazoo. This was followed by a <b>scaled-down</b> version known as the Petit Wazoo that toured the U.S. for five weeks from October to December 1972.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy {{has four}} basic game modes: an overworld map, town and dungeon maps, a battle screen, and a menu screen. The overworld map is a <b>scaled-down</b> {{version of the}} game's fictional world, which the player uses to direct {{characters}} to various locations. The primary means of travel across the overworld is by foot; a canoe, a ship, and an airship become available as the player progresses. With the exception of some battles in preset locations or with bosses, enemies are randomly encountered on field maps and on the overworld map when traveling by foot, canoe, or ship, and must either be fought or fled from.|$|E
5|$|Harding made {{it clear}} when he {{appointed}} Hughes as Secretary of State that the former justice would run foreign policy, a change from Wilson's close management of international affairs. Hughes had to work within some broad outlines; after taking office, Harding hardened his stance on the League of Nations, deciding the U.S. would not join even a <b>scaled-down</b> version of the League. With the Treaty of Versailles unratified by the Senate, the U.S. remained technically at war with Germany, Austria, and Hungary. Peacemaking began with the Knox–Porter Resolution, declaring the U.S. at peace and reserving any rights granted under Versailles. Treaties with Germany, Austria and Hungary, each containing many of the non-League provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, were ratified in 1921.|$|E
5|$|Like {{previous}} installments in the Tales series, Tales of Symphonia consists {{primarily of}} three major areas: an overworld field map, town and dungeon maps, and a battle screen. The overworld map is a 3D model, featuring a <b>scaled-down</b> {{version of the}} game's fictional world which the player travels through to reach the game's locations. As with preceding games in the series, the world map can be traversed by foot, on the party's quadrupedal pet Noishe, and on flying vehicles known as Rheairds. On field maps, characters are directed across realistically scaled environments. The battle screen is a 3D representation of an area, in which the player commands the characters in battles against CPU-controlled enemies.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the New Jersey Department of Transportation {{introduced}} {{a case study}} for Route31 for its New Jersey: Future in Transportation project. Over time, the residents and business owners of Raritan Township and Flemington had growing concerns over the congestion along the highway and US202. After trying to use vacant land {{to the east of}} the current alignment, the Department of Transportation put forth the Flemington Bypass, trying to relieve congestion on Route31 along the commercial district and to provide access to the industrial land between the two highways and the South Branch River. The project was never completed and the proposed site remains undeveloped. The Department of Transportation is now looking at a <b>scaled-down</b> bypass, proposed as the South Branch Parkway, to connect Route31 to US202 in Flemington.|$|E
5|$|In April 2012, it was {{announced}} that the Nickelodeon Suites Resort in Orlando would be reviving Double Dare as a nightly live stage presentation, Double Dare Live. As part of the Studio Nick feature of the hotel, shows were performed each night exclusively for the resort's guests. The show featured elements and updates from the various versions of Double Dare, including remixed music, physical challenges and an obstacle course similar to the TV show. Like the most recent formats of the program, eight contestants were selected to participate for the game-playing teams, while additional audience members played other physical challenges throughout the program. Previews of Double Dare Live began on May 21, 2012, with an official launch date of May 25. The production continued until Nickelodeon Suites Resort Orlando rebranded as a Holiday Inn Resort on June 1, 2016. A <b>scaled-down</b> version of Double Dare Live, called Double Dare Challenge, was presented at Nickelodeon Universe in Mall of America from June 13 to September 24, 2016, and ran again from June 16 to September 30, 2017.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the public concern about the mosque's size, the mosque's trustees did not choose Mangera's design for the final plan, deciding instead on a <b>scaled-down</b> structure. Abdul Sattar Shahid, {{speaking on behalf of}} the Tablighi Jamaat trustees, announced that the firm of Allies and Morrison was retained to design the mosque. In November 2011, it was reported that Allies & Morrison had been replaced by NRAP Architects. An outline planning application was submitted in May 2012. The scheme prepared by NRAP Architects included a prayer hall for over 9000, a refectory for 2000 and an Islamic library set within a public garden. A needs analysis and viability assessment submitted with the planning application seek to demonstrate that the proposals represent a justifiable departure from planning policy.|$|E
5|$|Like {{previous}} Final Fantasy installments, Final Fantasy VI {{consists of}} four basic modes of gameplay: an overworld map, town and dungeon field maps, a battle screen, and a menu screen. The overworld map is a <b>scaled-down</b> version of the game's fictional world, which the player uses to direct characters to various locations. As with most games in the series, the three primary means of travel across the overworld are by foot, chocobo, and airship. With a few plot-driven exceptions, enemies are randomly encountered on field maps and on the overworld when traveling by foot. The menu screen is where the player makes such decisions as which characters {{will be in the}} traveling party, which equipment they wield, the magic they learn, and the configuration of the gameplay. It is also used to track experience points and levels.|$|E
5|$|Team Razer was {{acknowledged}} {{for having}} devised and popularised the crushing and piercing arm weapon. Razer's success spawned {{a number of}} imitations: SuicidalTendencies, Ming3 and Tiberius are amongst the other heavyweight robots to have adopted such a weapon, whilst the featherweight robot Venom is a <b>scaled-down</b> replica of Razer. In 2001, Razer appeared in cartoon form on the front cover of the seventeenth issue of Robot Wars Magazine. It was {{also included in the}} Robot Wars video games. The version of Razer which competed in the fourth series of Robot Wars was used as the model for a pull-back toy powered by friction motors. This was sold alongside a model stunt ramp and barrels. A small metal toy based on Razer was available as part of the Robot Wars minibots range and, alongside Chaos 2 and Hypno-Disc, Razer was one of three competitor robots chosen to appear on a personalised DVD as part of the Robot Wars Ultimate Warrior Collection series.|$|E
5|$|The Port Authority {{voted to}} proceed with the <b>scaled-down</b> system in 1996. A final {{environmental}} impact statement (FEIS) for the JFK people mover, conducted by the Port Authority and released in 1997, examined eight possible transport improvements that could be constructed in order to provide this direct connection. Ultimately, a light rail with the qualities of a people mover, tentatively called the JFK Light Rail System, was selected as the most feasible mode of transportation for the new system. It would replace the shuttle buses that traveled between the terminals as well as to and from Howard Beach. The FEIS determined that an automated system with frequent headways was the most optimal design. The light rail would run from the airport terminals to either Jamaica or Howard Beach. It had been almost 30 years between the first JFK rail link proposal and the approval of the light rail system; within that time period, there had been 21 proposals for direct rail links to New York-area airports, which were all canceled.|$|E
25|$|A <b>scaled-down</b> stage musical {{version of}} the film known as Disney's Cinderella KIDS is {{frequently}} performed by schools and children's theaters.|$|E
25|$|A <b>scaled-down,</b> {{unmanned}} {{version of}} India's futuristic space shuttle {{was getting the}} final touches at the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) in Thumba as of 20 May 2015.|$|E
25|$|FIRST LEGO League is a {{partnership}} between FIRST and the LEGO Group. It also has a <b>scaled-down</b> robotics program for children ages 6–9 called FIRST LEGO League Jr..|$|E
25|$|In September 2008, the Department of the Army {{authorized}} {{a miniature}} metal tab {{to be worn}} on the new Army Service Uniform. This is a <b>scaled-down</b> replica of the President's Hundred full-color embroidered tab.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, Bandai {{wanted to}} deliver a <b>scaled-down</b> version of the Macintosh purely for CD-ROM game-playing. Bandai President and CEO Makoto Yamashina chose the Macintosh {{platform}} over other platforms available at the time.|$|E
25|$|The Momo-class {{ships were}} a <b>scaled-down</b> {{version of the}} Isokaze class and {{retained}} many of the innovations introduced by that class: curved, rather than straight bow, torpedo tubes, geared turbines, and a single-caliber main battery.|$|E
25|$|Lexicon {{continues}} {{to benefit from}} its initial LARES research and development. Lexicon currently offers a <b>scaled-down</b> and simplified microprocessor controller, the MC-12, intended for auditory enhancement within home and professional listening spaces. The system is called Lexicon LIVE.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after losing}} a NASA {{contract}} competition to SpaceX and Boeing in September 2014, Sierra Nevada Corporation announced it had conceptualized a launch system that combined a <b>scaled-down</b> {{version of the}} company’s Dream Chaser space plane with the Stratolaunch Systems high altitude air-launch system.|$|E
25|$|From {{the start}} of June 2014 the Corolla was re-launched as the Corolla Quest, which is a <b>scaled-down</b> model with less {{features}} as to target the entry level class B buyers. The Quest has been released with 1.6-litre engine in both 6-speed manual and 5-speed auto transmissions.|$|E
25|$|A <b>scaled-down</b> one act stage musical {{version of}} the film with the title Disney's Sleeping Beauty KIDS is often {{performed}} by schools and children's theaters. With book and additional lyrics by Marcy Heisler and Bryan Louiselle, the show is composed of twelve musical numbers, including the movie songs.|$|E
25|$|Model glider {{aircraft}} are flying or non-flying models of existing or imaginary gliders, often <b>scaled-down</b> versions of full size planes, using lightweight {{materials such as}} polystyrene, balsa wood, foam and fibreglass. Designs range from simple glider aircraft, to accurate scale models, some {{of which can be}} very large.|$|E
25|$|To {{celebrate}} {{its unique}} message of religious harmony, the chapel {{was to be}} a blend of conventional and unique characteristics. William Hosking drafted and redrafted an increasingly elegant solution to this design problem, beginning from a fairly conventional, <b>scaled-down</b> version of an Anglican gothic minster as a convenient starting point.|$|E
25|$|In late 1917, Fokker-Flugzeugwerke built {{two small}} biplane prototypes {{designated}} V.13. These aircraft combined {{a set of}} <b>scaled-down</b> D.VII wings with a fuselage and empennage closely mirroring those of the earlier Dr.I. The first prototype utilized an 82kW (110hp) Oberursel Ur.II rotary engine, while the second featured a 119kW (160hp) Siemens-Halske Sh.III bi-rotary engine.|$|E
25|$|Bonham {{first began}} playing drums {{at the age}} of four, and {{appeared}} with his father in the film The Song Remains the Same, drumming on a <b>scaled-down</b> kit. At 17, he joined his first band, Airrace. In 1985, he joined Virginia Wolf, making two albums and touring the US supporting the Firm.|$|E
25|$|It {{used the}} same Basic {{language}} (named T-Basic) with a few enhancements. Many research papers reference calculations done on the Iskra 226. The computer won a 1985 state prize. Later, a somewhat <b>scaled-down</b> Unix implementation was created for Iskra-226, which was widely used in the Soviet Union but is virtually unknown in the West.|$|E
25|$|The {{first public}} constructivist {{building}} actually built in Moscow by the Vesnin brothers, a 1927 department store in Presnensky District, was a <b>scaled-down</b> clone of their 1925 TsUM department store draft. It {{was followed by}} the Institute of Mineral Resources building in Zamoskvorechye District (1928) and a theater on Povarskaya Street (designed in 1929–1930, completed in 1931–1934).|$|E
25|$|The {{total mass}} of the {{satellite}} was 13.37 kilograms (30.80lb), of which 8.3kg (18.3lb) were instrumentation. In comparison, the {{mass of the}} first Soviet satellite Sputnik 1 was 83.6kg (184lb). The instrument section at {{the front end of the}} satellite and the empty <b>scaled-down</b> fourth-stage rocket casing orbited as a single unit, spinning around its long axis at 750 revolutions per minute.|$|E
25|$|Led Zeppelin Remasters is a three-LP (or two-cassette or two-CD) {{compilation}} {{album of}} digitally remastered material by English rock band Led Zeppelin. Containing songs from {{eight of the}} band's nine studio albums, it was initially released in the UK and Japan by Atlantic Records on 15 October 1990. The album is essentially a <b>scaled-down</b> version of the four-CD Led Zeppelin Boxed Set.|$|E
25|$|Like other vowels, <b>scaled-down</b> {{versions}} of the kana (ぃ, ィ) are used to express sounds foreign to the Japanese language, such as フィ (fi). In some Okinawan writing systems, a small ぃ is also combined with the kana く (ku) and ふ to form the digraphs くぃ kwi and ふぃ hwi respectively, although the Ryukyu University system uses the kana ゐ/ヰ instead.|$|E
