5|$|Pollard {{transferred}} to the United States Military Academy on March 22, where he played under coach Red Blaik. Vince Lombardi was their backfield coach. Due to transfer rules, Pollard was forced to sit out the 1949 season, and he enrolled at Rutherford Preparatory School to pass West Point's entrance exam. While at Army, {{he was known to}} focus his attention mainly on football, and not care much for academics. Gil Reich, his roommate at West Point, noted that he and several other friends of Pollard frequently helped each other so as to not <b>see</b> <b>anyone</b> drop out.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{although}} the Amusement Area {{was supposed to}} remain open for four hours after the exhibits closed at 10pm, the fair presented a fountain-and-fireworks show every night at 9pm at the Pool of Industry. Fairgoers would see this show and then leave the fair rather than head to the Amusement Area; one was hard pressed to <b>see</b> <b>anyone</b> on the fairgrounds by midnight.|$|E
25|$|After it {{slid off}} the runway, parts of the {{aircraft}} caught on fire. This reached high intensity and centered around the middle section of the fuselage and the right wing. The fire was not started when the aircraft left the runway, but commenced no later than 13 seconds afterwards. Forty-five seconds after the overrun the first fire engine arrived at the scene, the second five seconds after that. By 1 minute and 45 seconds after overrun, most of the fuselage was on fire. The tail collapsed at 3 minutes and 30 seconds after overrun, and 5 minutes and 45 seconds inside left engine stopped running. One fire engine left to resupply with water at 8 minutes, returning at 13 minutes. The first municipal fire engine came to the scene after 18 minutes. The fire crew initially did not <b>see</b> <b>anyone</b> near the wreckage and presumed all the passengers had perished. Only later did they realize that people standing near by were actually survivors. The fire was extinguished at 09:30.|$|E

25|$|In 1955, Ford {{made the}} lesser-known West Point drama The Long Gray Line for Columbia Pictures, {{the first of}} two Ford films to feature Tyrone Power, who had {{originally}} been slated to star as the adult Huw in How Green Was My Valley back in 1941. Later in 1955 Ford was hired by Warner Bros to direct the Naval comedy Mister Roberts, starring Henry Fonda, Jack Lemmon, William Powell, and James Cagney, but there was conflict between Ford and Fonda, who had been playing the lead role on Broadway {{for the past seven years}} and had misgivings about Ford's direction. During a three-way meeting with producer Leland Hayward to try and iron out the problems, Ford became enraged and punched Fonda on the jaw, knocking him across the room, an action that created a lasting rift between them. After the incident Ford became increasingly morose, drinking heavily and eventually retreating to his yacht, the Araner, and refusing to eat or <b>see</b> <b>anyone.</b> Production was shut down for five days and Ford sobered up, but soon after he suffered a ruptured gallbladder, necessitating emergency surgery, and he was replaced by Mervyn LeRoy.|$|E
500|$|Before the 1905 season got underway, Schulz {{contracted}} malaria in the spring. [...] Newspapers {{reported it}} was a [...] "serious attack" [...] and that he [...] "has been quite ill", but {{he was able to}} recuperate before the 1905 football season. [...] In October 1905, Coach Yost said: [...] "In looking over the whole bunch, I do not <b>see</b> <b>anyone</b> who has improved more than Schulz. [...] He is bigger and stronger than ever, and I do not know a man in the world that has it the least bit over him in the center position. [...] I would not trade him for any other center rush in the country today. [...] He looks good to me for the All-America team right now". [...] Though he was not selected for the All-America team in 1905, Schulz did receive All-Western honors.|$|E
500|$|The defense {{maintained}} that Abu-Jamal was innocent {{and that the}} prosecution witnesses were unreliable. The defense presented nine character witnesses, including poet Sonia Sanchez, who testified that Abu-Jamal was [...] "viewed by the black community as a creative, articulate, peaceful, genial man." [...] Another defense witness, Dessie Hightower, testified that he saw a man running along the street shortly after the shooting, {{although he did not}} see the shooting itself. His testimony contributed {{to the development of a}} [...] "running man theory", based on the possibility that a [...] "running man" [...] may have been the shooter. Veronica Jones also testified for the defense, but she did not <b>see</b> <b>anyone</b> running. Other potential defense witnesses refused to appear in court. Abu-Jamal did not testify in his own defense. Nor did his brother, William Cook, who told investigators at the crime scene: [...] "I ain't got nothing to do with this." ...|$|E

500|$|Räikkönen was demoted to from fifth to eighth {{place for}} causing the final lap {{collision}} with Bottas and scored only four points rather than ten, and this secured the constructors championship for Mercedes. McLaren driver Fernando Alonso {{was given a}} five-second penalty for exceeding track limits, promoting Toro Rosso's Max Verstappen to tenth. When asked about the collision with Bottas {{at the press conference}} for the following United States Grand Prix, Kimi Räikkönen remained unregenerate, saying: [...] " [...] hasn't changed. There were some discussions. I would still do it tomorrow again, that doesn't change the story." [...] Bottas took a different viewpoint, saying: [...] "I don't think it was a racing incident. I didn't <b>see</b> <b>anyone</b> there and I was in front, and then suddenly someone hits me. I should be on the podium, but I'm here with zero points instead. That's just disappointing." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{next morning}} Tarwater boarded {{a plane and}} headed home. Later that day, Phelps, facing the {{prospect}} of competing in eight events at the Olympics, elected to drop the 200-meter freestyle from his program. Phelps' decision allowed Tarwater to move up into the sixth spot in the 200-meter freestyle and {{be added to the}} relay team. Tarwater said he was [...] "shocked" [...] by the news and called it a [...] "storybook ending" [...] to his career. [...] "I was really content in walking away last night. [...] I was in peace and left with my faith intact. [...] To have this extra bout of joy is... surreal", he said. He immediately boarded another plane and flew back to Omaha, where the Trials were held, for a team meeting and practice. He told Olympic swim coach Gregg Troy, [...] "you won't <b>see</b> <b>anyone</b> show up with more focus and fire.... I will do everything I can to bolster the U.S. team." ...|$|E
500|$|That neighbor, {{a school}} bus driver {{returning}} home, noticed the young woman was not bleeding or visibly injured, but cold and shivering. He offered to telephone for help. She asked him not {{to call the police}} (one police report says [...] "pleaded") and assured him she'd already called AAA. (AAA has no record of any such call.) Knowing there was no cellular reception in the area, the bus driver continued home and called the police. His call was received by the Sheriff's Department at 7:43 pm. He was unable to see Murray's car while he made the phone call but did notice several cars pass on the road before the police arrived. Another local resident driving home from work claims she passed by the scene around 7:37 pm, and saw a police SUV parked face-to-face with Murray's car. She pulled over briefly and did not <b>see</b> <b>anyone</b> inside or outside the cars, and decided to continue home. This witness's claim contradicts the official police log, which has Haverhill police arriving nine minutes later.|$|E

2500|$|Few {{lawmakers are}} as honest, principled and {{consistent}} as Brinkman. But he exhibits those qualities to a fault, coming off as stubborn, ideologically rigid {{and unwilling to}} compromise. He's made many enemies in Columbus by refusing to <b>see</b> <b>anyone</b> else's side of things. This has limited his ability to work with others and get things done. [...] Brinkman won the March 2 primary: [...] 7,113 (63.00%) to 4,178 (37.00%).|$|E
