In cellular models overexpressing 10 different <b>solute</b> <b>carriers,</b> erythromycin uptake was significantly increased by OATP 1 A 2 (P < 0. 005) and OATP 1 B 3 (P < 0. 01).

Alterations of drug transport due to concomitantly administered drugs that interfere with drug transport may alter the kinetics of drug substrates. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that many drugs used {{for the treatment of}} metabolic disorders and cardiovascular diseases (e. g., oral antidiabetic drugs, statins) are substrates for uptake transporters and export proteins expressed in the intestine, the liver and the kidney. Since most patients with type 2 diabetes receive more than one drug, transporter-mediated drug-drug interactions are important molecular mechanisms leading to alterations in oral antidiabetic drug pharmacokinetics with the risk of adverse drug reactions.

The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are mainly the efflux transporters expressing at cancer cells, conferring the chemo-resistance in various malignant tumors, which has been well documented over the past decades. However, the function of influx transporters, in particular the <b>solute</b> <b>carriers</b> (SLC) in cancer cells, has only been recently well recognized to have significant impact on cancer therapy. The SLC transporters not only directly bring anticancer agents into cancer cells but also serve as the uptake mediators of essential nutrients for tumor growth and survival.

40|$|Abstract: Glucose is {{the major}} energy source for {{mammalian}} cells {{as well as an}} important substrate for protein and lipid synthesis. Mammalian cells take up glucose from extracellular fluid into the cell through two families of structurallyrelated glucose transporters. The facilitative glucose transporter family (<b>solute</b> <b>carriers</b> SLC 2 A, protein symbol GLUT) mediates a bidirectional and energy-independent process of glucose transport in most tissues and cells, while the Na + /glucose cotransporter family (<b>solute</b> <b>carriers</b> SLC 5 A, protein symbol SGLT) mediates an active, Na +-linked transport process against an electrochemical gradient. The GLUT family consists of thirteen members (GLUT 1 - 12 and HMIT). Phylogenetically, the members of the GLUT family are split into three classes based on protein similarities. Up to now, at least six members of the SGLT family have been cloned (SGLT 1 - 6). In this review, we report both the genomic structure and function of each transporter as well as intra-species comparative genomic analysis of some of these transporters. The affinity for glucose and transport kinetics of each transporter differs and ranges from 0. 2 to 17 mM. The ability of each protein to transport alternative substrates also differs and includes substrates such as fructose and galactose. In addition, the tissue distribution pattern varies between species. There are different regulation mechanisms of these transporters. Characterization of transcriptional control of some of the gene promoters has been investigated and alternative promoter usage to generate different protein isoforms has been demonstrated. We also introduce some pathophysiological roles of these transporters in human...|$|R

We identified two new human Adhesion GPCRs and 17 mouse orthologs in Paper IV.

It has been shown that TAAR1 is expressed and regulates immune function in rhesus monkey leukocytes (Babusyte et al., 2013; Nelson et al., 2007; Panas et al., 2012). In granulocytes, TAAR1 is necessary for chemotaxic migration of cells towards TAAR1 agonists. In addition, TAAR1 signaling in B and T cells can trigger immunoglobulin and cytokine release, respectively (Babusyte et al., 2013). TAAR1 is also expressed in the islets of Langerhans, stomach and intestines based on LacZ staining patterns carried out on TAAR1-KO LacZ mice (Revel et al., 2012c). Interestingly, the administration of selective TAAR1 partial agonist RO5263397 reverses the side effect of weight gain observed with the antipsychotic olanzapine, indicating that peripheral TAAR1 signalling can regulate metabolic homeostasis (Revel et al., 2012b)....Monoamine transporters and SLC22A carrier subfamily transport TAAR1 ligand: Studies using the rhesus monkey TAAR1 have shown that this receptor interacts with the monoamine transporters DAT, SERT, and NET in HEK cells (Miller et al., 2005; Xie and Miller, 2007; Xie et al., 2007). It has been hypothesized that TAAR1 interaction with these transporters might provide a mechanism by which TAAR1 ligands can enter the cytoplasm and bind to TAAR1 in intracellular compartments. A recent study has shown that in rat neonatal motor neurons, trace-amine specific signalling requires the presence and function of the transmembrane <b>solute</b> <b>carrier</b> SLC22A but not that of monoamine transporters (DAT, SERT, and NET) (Gozal et al., 2014). Specifically, it was shown that addition of Î²-PEA, tyramine, or tryptamine induced locomotor like activity (LLA) firing patterns of these neurons in the presence of N-Methyl D-Aspartate. Temporally, it was found that the trace amine induction of LLA is delayed compared to serotonin and norepinephrine induced LLA, indicating the target site for the trace amines is not located on the plasma membrane and could perhaps be intracellular.

Our focus was to elucidate underlying biologic processes. Although we initially found little overlap between changed metabolites and preconceived definitions of metabolic pathways, the use of unbiased network approaches identified significant concerted changes. Specifically, we derived a metabolic network with edges drawn between reactant and product nodes in individual reactions and between all substrates of individual enzymes and transporters. We searched for "active modules" [...] regions of the metabolic network enriched for changes in metabolite levels. Active modules identified relationships among changed metabolites and highlighted the importance of specific <b>solute</b> <b>carriers</b> in metabolite profiles. Furthermore, hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis demonstrated that changed metabolites in OGTT naturally grouped according to {{the activities of the}} System A and L amino acid transporters, the osmolyte carrier SLC 6 A 12, and the mitochondrial aspartate-glutamate transporter SLC 25 A 13. Comparison between NGT and IGT groups supported blunted glucose- and/or insulin-stimulated activities in the IGT group. Using unbiased pathway models, we offer evidence supporting the important role of <b>solute</b> <b>carriers</b> in the physiologic response to glucose challenge and conclude that carrier activities are reflected in individual metabolite profiles of perturbation experiments.

The overall aim of this thesis {{was to provide a}} basic understanding of some of the novel SLCs and GPCRs with emphasis on expression, transport property, evolution and probable function. The first part of the thesis directs towards the study of some novel <b>solute</b> <b>carriers.</b> In an initial study, we provided an overall picture of the sequence relationship and tissue expression of 14 diverse atypical SLCs confirming some of their evolutionary conservation and highly specific expression pattern. The focus then was on the SLC 17 family (mainly vesicular proteins) and a novel member named Slc 17 a 9. This study revealed that SLC 17 family could be divided into four main phylogenetic clades which were all present before the divergence of the insect lineage with Slc 17 a 9 having the most restricted evolutionary history. Detailed expression study of Slc 17 a 9 in the mouse brain suggests that it is also expressed in some regions important for purinergic neurotransmission. Further, we deorphanised an aminoacid transporter Slc 38 a 7 which was expressed in a majority of neurons in the CNS and showed that it preferably mediate transport of Lâ€“glutamine and Lâ€“histidine.
