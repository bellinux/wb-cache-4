50|$|To {{determine}} {{a position on}} the Earth's surface, it is necessary and sufficient to know the latitude, longitude, and altitude. Altitude considerations can, of course, be ignored for vessels operating at sea level.

Navigators could determine their latitude by measuring the sun's angle at noon (i.e., when it reached its highest point in the sky, or culmination) or, in the Northern Hemisphere, to measure the angle of Polaris (the North Star) from the horizon (usually during twilight).

40|$|In this study, {{we apply}} a {{two-dimensional}} variational analysis method (2 d-VAR) {{to select a}} wind solution from NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT) ambiguous winds. 2 d-VAR determines a "best" gridded surface wind analysis by minimizing a cost function. The cost function measures the misfit to the observations, the background, and the filtering and dynamical constraints. The ambiguity closest in direction to the minimizing analysis is selected. 2 d-VAR method, sensitivity and numerical behavior are described. 2 d-VAR is compared to statistical interpolation (OI) by examining the response of both systems to a single <b>ship</b> <b>observation</b> and to a swath of unique scatterometer winds. 2 d-VAR is used with both NSCAT ambiguities and NSCAT backscatter values. Results are roughly comparable. When the background field is poor, 2 d-VAR ambiguity removal often selects low probability ambiguities. To avoid this behavior, an initial 2 d-VAR analysis, using only the two most likely ambiguities, provides the first guess for an analysis using all the ambiguities or the backscatter data. 2 d-VAR and median filter selected ambiguities usually agree. Both methods require horizontal consistency, so disagreements occur in clumps, or as linear features. In these cases, 2 d-VAR ambiguities are often more meteorologically reasonable and more consistent with satellite imagery...|$|E
