5|$|Beginning in 1938 and {{throughout}} World War II, the SS enacted a procedure where offices and {{units of the}} SS could form smaller sub-units, known as SS-Sonderkommandos, to carry out <b>special</b> <b>tasks,</b> including large-scale murder operations. The use of SS-Sonderkommandos was widespread. According to former SS Sturmbannführer Wilhelm Höttl, not even the SS leadership knew how many SS-Sonderkommandos were constantly being formed, disbanded, and reformed for various tasks, especially on the Eastern Front.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} innovation of the 4th {{century was}} the corps of protectores, which contained cadet senior officers. Although protectores {{were supposed to be}} soldiers who had risen through the ranks by meritorious service, it became a widespread practice to admit to the corps young men from outside the army (often the sons of senior officers). The protectores formed a corps that was both an officer training-school and pool of staff officers available to carry out <b>special</b> <b>tasks</b> for the magistri militum or the emperor. Those attached to the emperor were known as protectores domestici and organised in four scholae under a comes domesticorum. After a few years' service in the corps, a protector would normally be granted a commission by the emperor and placed in command of a military regiment.|$|E

As a reformulation of Project Barnacle, the nature of its operations were disguised, and it disassociated itself from all other Special Forces and DMI (Directorate Military Intelligence) structures. The CCB formed the third arm of the Third Force, alongside Vlakplaas C1 and the <b>Special</b> <b>Tasks</b> projects.|$|E

According to Sudoplatov's <b>Special</b> <b>Tasks,</b> the NKVD proceeded to set up three NKVD agent networks {{to carry out the}} murder, one of which relied on Ramón Mercader. According to Sudoplatov, all of the three networks were designed to operate entirely autonomously from the NKVD's hitherto established spy networks in the U.S. and Mexico.|$|E

500|$|With Hitler's approval, Himmler re-established the Einsatzgruppen in the lead-up to {{the planned}} {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union. In March 1941, Hitler addressed his army leaders, detailing his intention to smash the Soviet Empire and destroy the Bolshevik intelligentsia and leadership. His special directive, the [...] "Guidelines in Special Spheres re Directive No. 21 (Operation Barbarossa)", read: [...] "In the operations area of the army, the Reichsführer-SS has been given <b>special</b> <b>tasks</b> on the orders of the Führer, in order to prepare the political administration. These tasks arise from the forthcoming final struggle of two opposing political systems. Within the framework of these tasks, the Reichsführer-SS acts independently and on his own responsibility." [...] Hitler thus intended to prevent internal friction like that occurring earlier in Poland in 1939, when several German Army generals had attempted to bring Einsatzgruppen leaders to trial for the murders they had committed.|$|E

2500|$|More generally, Simmel {{observes that}} because of their {{peculiar}} position in the group, strangers often carry out <b>special</b> <b>tasks</b> that {{the other members of}} the group are either incapable or unwilling to carry out. For example, especially in pre-modern societies, most strangers made a living from trade, which was often viewed as an unpleasant activity by [...] "native" [...] members of those societies. In some societies, they were also employed as arbitrators and judges, because they were expected to treat rival factions in society with an impartial attitude.|$|E

The Tribals were often selected for <b>special</b> <b>tasks</b> and as a result, losses were heavy, with 12 of the 16 Royal Navy Tribals sunk, {{as well as one}} Canadian ship. Gurkha has the rare and unfortunate distinction of being the name of two ships that were sunk in World War II: the L-class destroyer [...] was renamed to honour the lost Tribal-class ship, and was herself lost in 1942.|$|E

In a word, the channel was absolutely apolitical, there was no clear ether concept, its target audience was not defined, its management set any <b>special</b> <b>tasks</b> for the team. The possibilities of channel’s development under these conditions were exhausted. In 1999 the TNT managed to get two TEFI awards for the first season of [...] "The Cops" [...] (in the nomination [...] "Television feature film or TV series" [...] and [...] "Television project of the year") and the 8th place in the spectators’ rating with 3.2% of the audience, while the audience of the STS (its main competitor) was twice as big.|$|E

An artillery observation line was chosen and then a main line of resistance was dug [...] in front, [...] behind a crest overlooked by the observation line. Outposts were built along the crest, for infantry observers and listening-posts. Another line was built [...] further back near the field artillery, which {{became known as the}} [...] (artillery protection line), ready to be occupied by reserves, if the forward area was overrun. Command and supply became more difficult in such dispersed defences, which led to a streamlining of the chain of command, with battalion commanders being given sole authority over an area, as the [...] Division commanders were given similar control of the forces in the divisional sector, except for aviation units and some heavy artillery being used for <b>special</b> <b>tasks.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Trotsky {{had already}} been the object of an armed attack against the house where he was living, mounted by {{allegedly}} Soviet-recruited locals, including the ML muralist David Alfaro Siqueiros. The attack was organised and prepared by Pavel Sudoplatov, {{deputy director of the}} foreign department of the NKVD. In his memoirs, Sudoplatov claimed that, in March 1939, he had been taken by his chief, Lavrenti Beria, to see Stalin in person. Stalin told them that [...] "if Trotsky is finished the threat will be eliminated" [...] and gave the direct order, [...] "Trotsky should be eliminated within a year." [...] After the attack failed to eliminate Trotsky, a second team was sent, headed by Eitingon, formerly the deputy GPU agent in Spain and also allegedly involved in the kidnap, torture and murder of Andreu Nin, with the plan of using a lone assassin. The team included Mercader and his mother, Caridad. Sudoplatov claimed in his autobiography, <b>Special</b> <b>Tasks,</b> that he personally selected Ramón Mercader for the task of carrying out the assassination.|$|E
