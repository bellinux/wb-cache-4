The main advantages are high strenght and toughness in comparison with their low weight and density. An increased adhesion at composite interfaces is important to ensure excellent composite properties. Bundles of glass fibers were coated by plasma-polymerised interlayers of tetravinylsilane (pp-TVS) of different thicknesses and at different effective powers. The prepared interlayers of pp-TVS were analyzed to evaluate chemical composition (RBS, FTIR, XPS) and mechanical properties (NI-AFM).

The following are confirmed from this test result. When the elongation {{at the bottom}} of the boundary column on the compression side for a lateral force is small, the shear strength of shear walls subjected to a tensile axial force at the boundary column can be evaluated by conventional <b>shear</b> <b>strenght</b> equations, regardless of cycilc lateral loading and the eccentric tensile axial force.

40|$|Objective: To compare shear bond {{strength}} and the remaining adhesive index (RAI) of two types of primers: hydrophilic (Transbond™ MIP) and hydrophobic (Transbond™ XT Light Cure Adhesive y Rely-a-bond®) on bovine teeth enamel exposed to contamination (saliva and water) and without contamination. Materials and Methods: 99 permanent bovine incisors were used and divided into nine study groups, three groups for each primer: Group 1, 2 and 3 with Transbond™ MIP; Group 4, 5 and 6 with Transbond™ XT Light Cure Adhesive; Group 7, 8 and 9 with Rely-a-Bond® and every primer was evaluated without contamination, and then contaminated with saliva and water. The measurements of shear strength bond were performed on the universal test machine INSTRON® {{at a rate of}} 0. 5 mm per minute, RAI was evaluated in all samples. Results: The measurement of <b>shear</b> bond <b>strenght</b> in the non contaminated groups was similar to the Transbond™ XT Light Cure Adhesive and Transbond™ MIP primers, but significantly lower for the Rely-a-bond® primer (p< 0. 05). In the contaminated samples, the Transbond™ MIP primer had higher shear {{bond strength}} than the hydrophobic primers. Significant statistically differences were found in all groups (p< 0. 001). RIA was evaluated and {{it was found that the}} majority of groups had results of grade 0 and 1. Conclusions: Water and saliva contamination decreased <b>shear</b> bond <b>strenght</b> using hydrophobic primers. On the other hand, the hydrophilic primer was not affected by the water and saliva contamination.

40|$|Although several {{conventional}} surface treatments {{have been}} used on feldspathic ceramic, a few studies investigated {{the effects of the}} irradiation with Er: YAG laser using different parameters. The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the shear bond strength of a resin cement to feldspathic ceramic, after the application of different surface treatments, especially the irradiation with Er:YAG laser. Forty-two discs made of a feldspathic ceramic were divided into six groups (n = 7) : G 1 : control group - 10 % hydrofluoric acid (HF), G 2 : Air abrasion with Al 2 O 3 + HF; G 3 : Er: YAG laser with 500 mJ/ 4 Hz, G 4 : Er: YAG laser with 500 mJ/ 4 Hz: + HF; G 5 : Er: YAG laser with 400 mJ/ 6 Hz and G 6 : Er:YAG laser with 400 mJ/ 6 Hz + HF. After this, all the specimens were treated with silane, and then a resin cement cylinder was built on the treated ceramic surface. After 24 h at 37 oC, specimens were submitted to the <b>shear</b> bond <b>strenght</b> test and stereoscopic evaluation to determine the type of failure. The mean bond strength values (MPa) obtained were: G 1 - 17. 55, G 2 - 18. 80, G 3 - 21. 80, G 4 - 12. 62, G 5 - and 15. 81 G 6 - 11. 59. After performing the ANOVA and Tukey's test, it was concluded that the group irradiated with Er:YAG laser at 500 mJ/ 4 Hz performed similarly to the groups that received the conventional treatments, such as hydrofluoric acid etching and the combination of air abrasion plus hydrofluoric acid, and was higher than the other groups irradiated with Er:YAG laser. </p...|$|R

40|$|The archeological {{site of the}} Latomia del Paradiso (Syracuse) is {{endangered}} by severe instability phenomena due {{to the shape of}} walls and underground excava-tion related with the poor mechanical characteristics of the weathered and wet rock. The failure of huge blocks from the ceiling of the underground areas and the detaching of rock "flakes" from the walls surface make the geotechnical zon-ing particularly complex. the zoning is based on the characteristics of the rock wall surface that, in first approximation, can be distinguished in regularized sur-faces because of mining, and in irregular surfaces characterized by fracture prop-agation. The elaboration of reflectivity values obtained from a laser scanner survey pro-vides a quick and reliable method, which can be very useful to assess the localization of alteration processes and their intensity. Alteration processes affect the mechanical characteristics and a decay of a rock mass <b>shear</b> <b>strenght</b> is associated to them.

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the hydraulic behavior in the underground is of crucial importance for the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons deposits. In fault zones the fluid flow could be held back {{by the presence of}} inserted clay material (Clay Smear) There are different approaches to asses the continuity of this clay smear in fault zones that take into accoun the thickness of the initial thickness in the clay layer and the offset in the fault zone (e. g. Shale Gouge Ratio – SGR). Based on limit values is then estimated whether the clay material in the fault zone has a sealing effect or not. Parameter of great importance and influence in these process, such as <b>shear</b> <b>strenght</b> of the materials and the stress level at which the clay is introuduced in the fault zone are not takein into account in these approaches. In a interdiciplinary research project developed in the RWTH Aachen University by the Institute of Geotechnical Engineering (GiB) and the Institute of Structural Geology (GED), is being investigated how and under which conditions is clay incorporated in a subsurface fault, using field work, sandbox experiments and numerical simulations. In the present work the results of the numerical studies are presented. First of all, the free localisation would be investigated in a numerical model “Homogene Extension”. This model consists on a rectangular model which is extended laterally from both sides. The deformation caused by this extension would create a shear band initiated from a weak spot located {{in the middle of the}} model. With such models the inclination angle of the free formed shear band could be investigated. Subsequently the results of sandbox experiments with pure sand are simulated numercally. Using this model the shear bands developed in such experiments can be studied and in addition the modeling of Sanbox experiments with pure sand provides the possibility of calibrate the parameters of sand. These parameters would be used later to model Sanbox experiments with sand and clay layers. Finally, the sandbox experiments with a clay layer are simulated using a two dimensional model. The results of these models show that the clay layer within the shear band becomes thinner until the point where holes are formed. The thinning of the clay layer in within the shear band is in good agreement with the laboratory measurements taken from the side in contact with the glass wall. Further calculations are performed to determine the influence of parameters on the resulting clay layer thickness located inside the shear band. From the determined influence factors a new calculation method to predict the clay smear is presented. With this new method, the limit values for SGR are calculated. SGR is the ratio of the offset displacement of the shear band and the intial thickness of the clay layer. In these calculated limits, the stress level, the <b>shear</b> <b>strenght</b> and the influence of the kinematic, are linked together with the development of the stresses. The developed method is based on physical principles and offers the possibility of a calibration based on measured data from laboratory experiments and field studies. Such calibration will not take place in this work...|$|E
40|$|The clay in Scania is {{generally}} over consolidated. When {{the soil is}} evaluated by using CPTU, it is evaluated {{in the same way}} as it would be done for normal or slightly over consolidated clay. It has been shown that the undrained shear strength evaluated in this way is lower for the clay in Scania compared with what experience shows for this type of clay. A literature review was conducted to better understand how the shear strength is evaluated by using CPTU. Also which field methods and laboratory methods that is suitable for study the shear strength of the clay was studied. This study showed that CPTU was calibrated against direct simple shear test and a cone factor, NkT, is used too evaluated the undrained shear strength from CPTU. Two sample sites were selected, Ängelholm and Örtofta, where field tests were conducted and samples were collected. These sites were chosen from the knowledge that there would be over consolidated clay. Field tests and sampling was conducted in June and July 2015. Subsequent laboratory tests were carried out between August and October 2015 where the undrained <b>shear</b> <b>strenght</b> was determined. From the knowledge of the undrained shear strength of the clay from vane test, cone test, direct simple shear test and triaxial test, a new cone factor was calculated. The results indicate that a lower cone factor can be used for over consolidated clay. But it requires further laboratory tests to confirm and evaluate a representative cone factor.

40|$|Intensive alloy {{development}} {{studies on}} intermetallic gamma (#gamma#) based alloys {{in recent years}} has {{led to the development of}} several aerospace engine components using advanced #gamma#-TiAl based alloys by ingot and powder metallurgical routes. These materials are of great interest to the aerospace industry owing to their very low density and good high temperature properties. Further application of this material will require the development of successful joining and cost effective fabrication methods. Joining of this intermetallic alloy by fusion joining processes, however, requires very careful process controlling, i. e. low cooling rates and very high preheat temperatures. On the other hand, solid state joining processes, particularly diffusion bonding, brazing, and friction welding, can readily be used to join this material. In the present work, successful application of solid state diffusion bonding to weld investment cast #gamma#-TiAl alloys has been demonstrated. A series of diffusion bonds were produced without using an interlayer at temperatures ranging from 950 to 1100 C with different pressure levels and holding times. Bonds have been characterized using optical and scanning electron microscopy. Defect-free bonds were achieved for all the conditions studied. The bond qualities were assessed by shear testing at room temperature. Reasonable <b>shear</b> <b>strenght</b> levels were obtained by bonding at 1000 and 1100 C for 3 h at pressures of 20 and 40 MPa, respectively.

Waste Rubber Powder is being used as wood adhesive filler in order to change the research work from waste to wealth.

Most of the plywood adhesives are formaldehyde based, which are not environmental friendly due to the formaldehyde emission, formaldehyde is considered as a carcinogenic agent. Due to the formaldehyde emission issue, plywood export to Europe and United State had been decreased. Therefore, the formaldehyde emission from the plywood is reduced. This work demonstrates the effect of filler at shear strength, water resistant and formaldehyde performance. Response surface methodology (RSM) software was used for identification of the optimum temperature and pressing time for wood adhesive performance. The optimum parameters investigated in this experiment was in the temperature range from 100 to 175 °C at fixed pressing time at 150 sec while in the time range from 50 to 450 s at fixed prssing temperature at 125 ˚C.

40|$|Sixty {{exposures}} of lucinid deposits ("calcari a Lucina" of the literature) {{in different}} depositional and tectonic settings {{of the northern}} Apeninnes, from backland (satellite and minor basins) to foredeep (turbidites and closure deposits) and foreland (Sicily), were studied and, in many cases, reinterpreted in the field. Field and compositional data show that lucinid deposits include not only peculiar carbonate blocks, but a variety of lithologies and fossil assemblages: micritic limestones, marly limestones, mudstones, marls and arenitic marls, fine to coarse-grained arenites, fine to coarse-grained calcarenites, carbonate monomictic and polymictic breccias and microconglomerates. The fossil content is not only adscribable to the genus Lucina, but more generally to lucinids or other bivalves. Lithological and compositional characters are mainly controlled by the depositional and tectonic setting. Lucinid deposits from satellite basins and foredeep slope sediments show evidences of primary deposition while those included in foredeep turbidite deposits are clearly reworked. In some cases only isolated shells are reworked. Primary lucinid deposits occur as: - type 1) marly-calcareous and calcarenitic lenses or column-like bodies, crowded with articulated specimens usually representing the dominant fauna of an oligotypic community; these lenses are often clustered but not related to a precise stratigraphic level and they gradually pass to the host sediments (marly mudstones); - type 2) isolated specimens or associated with a dense high diversity fauna in mudstones, marls, arenitic and calcareous marls. Secondary lucinid deposits occur as: - type 3) carbonate olistoliths crowded with articulated or disarticulated specimens associated with an oligotypic fauna; they are usually enclosed within chaotic horizons made up of intraformational slumps, ligurian-subligurian olistostromes, ligurian-epiligurian olistoliths, resedimented arenitic beds and polymictic breccias, intercalated in turbiditic formations; - type 4) coquina debris, isolated articulated or disarticulated shells, (in few cases associated with abundant fauna from shelf areas) in resedimented arenites, calcarenites, carbonate breccias with biogenic debris (debrites). Most of the type- 1 and type- 3 deposits are strongly 13 C depleted, and are interpreted as chemosynthetic communities (pseudobioherms) with authigenic carbonate deposition related to methane-rich fluid vents. Petrographic data show that {{the composition of the}} siliciclastic fraction present in lucinid deposits is consistent with the composition of the host deposits. Lucinid deposits included in the foredeep turbidites of the Marnoso-arenacea and Cervarola Formations display a wide variety of textures and lithologies. Most of the samples are characterized by a sort of "chaotic" texture with an abundant terrigenous fraction associated with micritic intraclasts and planctonic foraminifera. The interstitial fraction is made of micrite, but microspatic to spatitic calcite cements and patchy poikilotopic calcite are also present. The composition of the terrigenous fraction shows a great similarity with the composition of the including turbidites, thus indicating only an intrabasinal reworking of lucinid deposits. In primary, non reworked lucinid deposits of the epiligurian (Termina Formation) and slope sediments (Vicchio and Letto Marls) the terrigenous fraction is absent or very scarse and fine-grained. Samples show more homogeneous textures and lithologies, mainly represented by micritic to biomicritic limestones; planctonic foraminifera are abundant. Detrital carbonate clasts of ligurian affinity are sometimes present in epiligurian lucinid outcrops. According to this study, primary pseudobioherms occur only in epiligurian and foredeep closure pelitic sediments, rich in organic matter. Lucinid deposits in the Marnoso-arenacea and Cervarola foredeep turbidites show evidence of a moderate reworking probably from adjacent slope pelites. Reworking processes are then related to the advancement of the deformational front, as indicated by slumps and olistostromes. Only lucinid deposits located {{at the top of the}} thrust belt front (satellite basins) or in mudstones marking the closure stage of the foredeep could have the possibility to be preserved as primary deposits, whereas most of the slope sediments, which represent the main source of secondary lucinid deposits, is reworked and resedimented in the turbiditic units. This is due to foredeep instability phenomena, probably heralding the tectonic events. On the other hand the cold seepage could have lowered the sediment <b>shear</b> <b>strenght</b> and opened the way to foredeep instability which in turn could let the gases out more easily. We hypothesize that the source of the oldest pseudobioherms is represented by the Vicchio Marls, whereas isolated shells and coquina debris in resedimented beds of the minor basins and of the problematic Cervarola-Falterona Formation of the Modena-Bologna Apennine, are probably originated from satellite basins or from faunal communities (methane related ?) located in pelitic horizons no more preserved. Confirming this hypothesis, two pelitic horizons bearing methanogenic lucinid blocks are still preserved in the inner Marnoso-arenacea. A comparison between lucinid concentration peaks (Serravallian-Tortonian and Tortonian-Messinian boundaries) and the neogenic tectonic events of the Apenninic chain do not show any particular relation. No direct connection between fracture planes and the irregular disposition of the non reworked lucinid deposits seems to be evident. Thus further studies are necessary in order to better understand the relations between the advancement of the thrust belt front and fluid escape. Isotopic, sedimentological, stratigraphycal and structural data seem to support that biogenic methane is likely to have been the main source for primary pseudobioherms and related carbonate deposits. The gas could have a shallow origin in local pockets from biodegradation of trapped organic matter. Lucinid pseudiobioherms grew in different open marine environment, from outer shelf to deep basins and do not characterize a precise paleogeographic or paleotectonic setting. Petrographic data also suggest to correlate the Castel Guerrino unit to the Marnoso-arenacea Formation and to interpret the middle Miocene Cervarola Formation of the Modena-Bologna Apennine as a minor foredeep basin (internal part of the Marnoso-arenacea Formation ?) ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn-Situ Micromechanical Testing in Extreme EnvironmentsByAmanda Sofia LupinacciDoctor of Philosophy in Engineering - Materials Science and EngineeringUniversity of California, Berkeley Professor Andrew M. Minor, Chair In {{order to}} design {{engineering}} applications that can withstand extreme environments, {{we must first}} understand the underlying deformation mechanisms that can hinder material performance. It {{is not enough to}} characterize the mechanical properties alone, we must also characterize the microstructural changes as well so that we can understand the origin of material degradation. This dissertation focuses on two different extreme environments. The first environment is the cryogenic environment, where we focus on the deformation behavior of solder below the ductile to brittle transition temperature (DBTT). The second environment is the irradiated environment, where we focus on the effects that ion beam irradiation has on both the mechanical properties and microstructure of 304 stainless steel. Both classes of materials and testing environments utilize novel in situ micromechanical testing techniques inside a scanning electron microscope which enhances our ability to link the observed deformation behavior with its associated mechanical response. This dissertation presents the development of a novel in situ cryogenic micromechanical testing apparatus in a SEM. This technique makes it possible to directly link the observed deformation behavior of solders with the mechanical response below the DBTT. This dissertation also presents a novel method for linking the observed changes in mechanical properties of ion irradiated steels with changes in the defect density by the use of both nanoindentation, laue microdiffraction and in-situ micromechanical testing. Characterizing plasticity mechanisms below the DBTT is traditionally difficult to accomplish in a systematic fashion. Here, we use a new experimental setup to perform in situ cryogenic mechanical testing of pure Sn micropillars at room temperature and at - 142 °C. Subsequent electron microscopy characterization of the micropillars shows a clear difference in the deformation mechanisms at room temperature and at cryogenic temperatures. At room temperature, the Sn micropillars deformed through dislocation plasticity while at - 142 °C they exhibited both higher strength and deformation twinning. Two different orientations were tested, a symmetric (100) orientation and a non-symmetric (45 &hibar; 1) orientation. The deformation mechanisms were found to be the same for both orientations. This approach was also extended to a more complex solder alloy that is commonly used in industry, Sn 96. In the case of the solder alloy more complex geometries were also utilized to obtain better understanding of the deformation mechanisms {{in the presence of a}} preexisting defect, such as a crack. Similar twinning behavior is observed in the Sn 96 alloy however, it was also found that grain boundaries and second phase intermetallics can act as sources for dislocation motion and generation. The observations and analysis in this thesis give novel insight into the deformation mechanisms of two materials in extreme environments. In the case of cryogenic testing we have demonstrated the preference for Sn based solders to undergo deformation twinning as a primary deformation mechanism below the DBTT of the alloy. Prior to this study, deformation mechanisms of pure Sn below the DBTT were not well characterized due to a lack of experimental methods for doing so. In this study, we have developed a novel in situ cryogenic apparatus that has made it possible to systematically study plasticity mechanisms down to - 142 °C. Through EBSD and TEM characterization of the twinning behavior at cryogenic temperatures, we have gained a greater understanding of the deformation mechanisms that are active below the DBTT. Furthermore, we have extended this technique to a more complex alloy, Sn 96 as well as more complex geometries (clamped beam geometry). In the case of ion irradiated stainless steel, which is a surrogate for neutron irradiations, we have correlated the mechanical property response that is associated with various irradiation conditions with the defects induced during irradiation. Due to the fact that ion beam irradaion has a limted penetration depth, nanoindetation and micro compression testing needed to be deployed. Through both nanoindentation and Laue micro diffraction we have shown a direct correlation between the observed radaition induced increase in hardness and the radaition induced increase in FWHM. We found that 10 dpa ion beam irradaion is enough to saturate the material in hardening as well as lattice strain which is related to the defects present [...] It was found that the 304 SS shows no FWHM gradient assocatied with the ion beam irradiation The use of micropillars also enabeld us to characterize the dramatic change in yield strength due to ion beam irradiation while a detaield charactreisation of each micro pillar in regards to the critical resolved <b>shear</b> <b>strenght</b> is conducted. It was found that the radiation envrionment causes not just an increace in critical resolved shear stress but the material also looses its workhardenability completely. It is also shown that post testing TEM investigation of the pillars on 304 stainless steel apears not possible due to the fact that FIB damage induces a stress induced phase transfomration and therefore a detailed crystallogprahic examination using TEM cannot be conducted. In summary this thesis demonstrate novel small scale mechanical testing techniques on engineering applications which opens the gate to utilize basic scientific tools on engineering problems...|$|E
