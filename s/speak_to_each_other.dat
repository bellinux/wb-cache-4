5|$|At {{no point}} during The Wrath of Khan are Khan and Kirk {{in the same}} location; they <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> only over {{communication}} links such as view screens. This was {{due in part to}} the fact that the set of the Reliant was a redress of the Enterprise bridge, and the two actors' scenes were filmed four months apart. Montalbán recited his lines with a script assistant instead of to William Shatner.|$|E
5|$|In {{the control}} and living spaces, the ship had quieted down, too. Orders were given in low voices; the men <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> {{carrying}} out their normal duties, in a repressed atmosphere. A regular pall has descended upon us. I know that all hands {{are aware of the}} decision and recognize the need for it. Perhaps they are relieved {{that they did not have}} to make it. But it is apparent that this unexpected illness, something that could neither have been foreseen nor prevented, may ruin our submergence record.|$|E

In KoL, a player's character fights monsters for experience, and acquiring meat (the game's currency), and/or items, through a turn-based system. Players may also {{interact with each}} other through player versus player competition, participate in the in-game economy by trading goods and services, organize their characters into clans, work together to complete clan dungeons, and <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> in many different chat channels.|$|E

5|$|Murray {{skipped the}} World Group 1st round tie against Argentina, over fears he could {{exacerbate}} a knee injury, leaving the British {{team in a}} hopeless situation – they lost 4–1. Jamie was furious that Andy was letting them down and the Murrays would not <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> for two weeks. Seven months later, as the brothers prepared for the tie against Austria, Andy declared that he had healed the rift with Jamie. When Jamie Murray and Ross Hutchins were beaten in the doubles, John Lloyd suffered criticism for not playing Andy. Great Britain lost their World Group play-off to Austria 3–2 and were relegated to Europe/Africa Zone Group I.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Detours had become the Who, they had already found regular gigs, {{including}} at the Oldfield Hotel in Greenford, the White Hart Hotel in Acton, the Goldhawk Social Club in Shepherd's Bush, and the Notre Dame Hall in Leicester Square. They had also replaced Druce as manager with Helmut Gorden, with whom they secured an audition with Chris Parmeinter for Fontana Records. Parmeinter found problems with the drumming and, according to Sandom, Townshend immediately turned on him and threatened to fire him if his playing did not immediately improve. Sandom left in disgust, but was persuaded to lend his kit to any potential stand-ins or replacements. Sandom and Townshend did not <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> again for 14 years.|$|E
5|$|Murray {{represented}} Great Britain at his maiden Olympics in Beijing 2008. He {{competed in}} the singles and doubles competitions. Despite being seeded sixth in the singles competition, he was eliminated {{in the first round}} by Chinese Taipei's Yen-hsun Lu. Along with his brother Jamie, he advanced to {{the second round of the}} doubles competition with a win over the Canadian pairing of Daniel Nestor and Frédéric Niemeyer. The Murray brothers were eliminated in the second round by France's Arnaud Clément and Michael Llodra. In February, Murray pulled out of the Davis Cup tie against Argentina, because of a knee injury, so Argentina thrashed the under-strength British team. Jamie Murray scathingly criticised Andy and they did not <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> for a fortnight. Their rift continued in the Olympic doubles, over a perceived lack of effort from Andy.|$|E

5|$|Reina is Shuna's {{younger sister}} who closely resembles Serena and dresses in gothic Lolita-style clothing. She grew up hearing stories of Pompeii and {{developed}} a crush on Souichi. After Reina has her confession rejected by Souichi, she runs away and happens upon Keidai and the others. She discovers that he also has memories of Pompeii and brings them to Shuna hoping it would bring back her memories. She {{is in the same}} class as Yuuma where their similarities make them seem like twins. Reina and Yuuma grow close as friends and begin to <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> about their problems. They connect over their predicament of having romantic feelings for those who only see them as a younger sibling. Reina is later revealed to be the reincarnation of a girl named , a friend of Serena. Her appearance of resembling Serena is explained as Tina's wish to experience the same love Serena has with Sirix.|$|E
5|$|Ross {{utilized}} {{his many}} hockey connections throughout Canada and the United States to sign players. Even so, the team started poorly. Early {{in the first}} season the University of Toronto hockey team was in Boston for matches against local universities. The team's manager, Conn Smythe, who later owned and managed the Toronto Maple Leafs, said that his team could easily defeat the Bruins—Ross's team had won only two of their first fifteen NHL games. This began a feud between Smythe and Ross which lasted for over 40 years, until Ross' death; while mostly confined to newspaper reports, they refused to <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> at NHL Board of Governor meetings. The Bruins finished their first season with six wins in thirty games, {{one of the worst}} records {{in the history of the}} league. Several records were set over the course of the season; the three home wins are tied for the second fewest ever, and an eleven-game losing streak from December 8, 1924, until February 17, 1925, set a record for longest losing streak, surpassed in 2004 and now second longest in history. With 17 wins in 36 games the following season, the team greatly improved, and finished one point out of a playoff spot.|$|E
25|$|In signing for Leeds, Somma {{became the}} fifth South African {{to play for}} Leeds {{following}} Gerry Francis, Albert Johanneson, Lucas Radebe and Phil Masinga. In an LUTV interview, Somma said that, due to his Italian heritage, he and teammate Mike Grella can <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> in Italian. Somma made his debut for Leeds in a reserve game against Rotherham United, and marked the game by scoring two goals.|$|E

25|$|Miller and Kazan {{were close}} friends {{throughout}} the late 1940s and early 1950s, but after Kazan's {{testimony to the}} HUAC, the pair's friendship ended, {{and they did not}} <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> for the next ten years. The HUAC took an interest in Miller himself not long after The Crucible opened, denying him a passport to attend the play's London opening in 1954. Kazan defended his own actions through his film On the Waterfront, in which a dockworker heroically testifies against a corrupt union boss.|$|E
25|$|On July 19, 2010, Ellerbe {{denied that}} {{negotiations}} ever took place {{and nothing was}} ever agreed on. Ellerbe stated: Here are the facts: Al Haymon, Richard Schaefer and myself <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> {{on a regular basis}} and the truth is no negotiations have ever taken place nor was there ever a deal agreed upon by Team Mayweather or Floyd Mayweather to fight Manny Pacquiao on November 13. Either Ross Greenburg or Bob Arum is not telling the truth, but history tells us who is lying. Three days later, Schaefer backed Ellerbe's statement that negotiations never took place.|$|E
25|$|Daimler had {{developed}} the first liquid petroleum vehicle in 1885 and Carl Benz {{had developed}} the first purpose built automobile using a 2 cycle engine {{of his own}} design a few months later.

Daimler won and Benz had to pay royalties to DMG. Daimler did not meet Carl Benz while they were in court in Mannheim. Later at the founding of the Central European Motor Car Association Daimler and Benz still did not <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b>|$|E

25|$|Joba {{was born}} Justin Louis Heath on September 23, 1985. He {{grew up in}} Lincoln, Nebraska. Chamberlain's parents, Harlan Chamberlain and Jackie Standley, were never married and split up when Joba was 18 months old. Some sources say that Harlan Chamberlain {{obtained}} full custody of Joba when he was 3 years old, but Standley claims that Joba lived with her {{most of the time}} until he was 10 when she had his surname legally changed from Heath, her maiden name, to Chamberlain. Standley began abusing drugs when Joba was 4 or 5 and says that she and Joba currently <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> only rarely.|$|E
25|$|After Prima Vera's breakup in 1984, Herodes Falsk and Jahn Teigen did not <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> for 15 years. Even when a {{compilation}} {{album of the}} band's greatest hits called Absolute Prima Vera was released in 1994, Teigen and Falsk/Mathisen held separate press conferences to promote the album. However, in 1999, after the funeral of their mutual friend, guitarist Marius Müller {{who died in a}} car accident, Teigen and Falsk talked {{for the first time since}} the breakup, and cleared the air. In March 2000, at a memorial concert for Müller exactly one year after his death, Prima Vera performed for the first time in 18 years at Rockefeller in Oslo.|$|E
25|$|The {{second book}} of the Iliad also lists the Trojan allies, {{consisting}} of the Trojans themselves, led by Hector, and various allies listed as Dardanians led by Aeneas, Zeleians, Adrasteians, Percotians, Pelasgians, Thracians, Ciconian spearmen, Paionian archers, Halizones, Mysians, Phrygians, Maeonians, Miletians, Lycians led by Sarpedon and Carians. Nothing is said of the Trojan language; the Carians are specifically said to be barbarian-speaking, and the allied contingents {{are said to have}} spoken multiple languages, requiring orders to be translated by their individual commanders. It should be noted, however, that the Trojans and Achaeans in the Iliad share the same religion, same culture and the enemy heroes <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> in the same language, though this could be dramatic effect.|$|E

25|$|Along with {{a number}} of other Soviet chess champions, he signed a {{petition}} condemning the actions of the defector Viktor Korchnoi in 1976. It was the continuation of a bitter feud between the two, dating back at least to their 1974 Candidates semifinal match in which Petrosian withdrew after five games while trailing 3½–1½ (+3−1=1). His match with Korchnoi in 1977 saw the two former colleagues refuse to shake hands or <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> They even demanded separate eating and toilet facilities. Petrosian went on to lose the match and was subsequently fired as editor of Russia's largest chess magazine, 64. His detractors condemned his reluctance to attack and some put it down to a lack of courage. At this point however, Botvinnik spoke out on his behalf, stating that he only attacked when he felt secure and his greatest strength was in defence.|$|E
25|$|Negotiated {{performance}} appraisal: The negotiated {{performance appraisal}} (NPA) is an emerging approach for improving communication between supervisors and subordinates and for increasing employee productivity, {{and may also}} be adapted to an alternate mediation model for supervisor-subordinate conflicts. A facilitator meets separately with the supervisor and with the subordinate to prepare three lists. What employees do well, where the employee has improved in recently, and areas where the employee still needs to improve. Because the subordinate will present his or her lists first during the joint session, this reduces defensive behaviors. Furthermore, the subordinate comes to the joint session not only prepared to share areas of needed improvement, but also brings concrete ideas as to how these improvements can be made. The NPA also focuses very strongly on what employees are doing well, and involves a minimum of twenty minutes of praise when discussing what the employee does well. The role of the facilitator {{is that of a}} coach in the pre-caucuses, and in the joint sessions the supervisor and subordinate mostly <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> with little facilitator interference.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, Khanna {{fell in love}} with the then fashion {{designer}} and actress Anju Mahendru. They were in a relationship for seven years. Mahendru states that the couple did not <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> for 17 years after the break-up. Later Khanna married the budding actress Dimple Kapadia in March 1973, before Kapadia's debut film Bobby released in November of that year. They have two daughters from the marriage; Twinkle and Rinke. Khanna and Kapadia separated in 1984, but did not complete the divorce proceedings. In the 1980s Tina Munim was romantically involved with Khanna while working with Khanna in 11 movies from 1980 to 1987. Munim had been a fan of Rajesh since her school days. According to website Bollywood Mantra reporter, the relationship with Tina ended in 1987, when Khanna refused to marry her as their marriage would have a bad impact on his daughters. Khanna and Kapadia however maintained an amicable relationship where they both were seen together at parties and family functions. Kapadia also campaigned for Khanna's election and worked in his film Jai Shiv Shankar (1990).|$|E
