5|$|Their {{movement}} is bold, free and characteristically fast, {{especially at the}} trot, with great power coming from the hocks. Their trot has been favourably {{compared to that of}} the Standardbred horse. They are reputed to be trustworthy, of a good disposition with even temperaments and friendly characters, but spirited and with great endurance, and are known for their stamina, <b>soundness,</b> and high level of intelligence.|$|E
5|$|Secretariat's dam was Somethingroyal, the 1973 Kentucky Broodmare of the Year. Although Somethingroyal was unplaced in {{her only}} start, {{she had an}} {{excellent}} pedigree. Her sire Princequillo was the leading broodmare sire from 1966 to 1970 and was noted {{as a source of}} stamina and <b>soundness.</b> Her dam Imperatrice was a stakes winner who was purchased by Christopher Chenery at a dispersal sale in 1947 for $30,000. Imperatrice produced several stakes winners and stakes producers for the Meadow. Prior to foaling Secretariat at age 18, Somethingroyal had already produced Sir Gaylord, a stakes winner who became an important sire, whose offspring included Epsom Derby winner Sir Ivor. Somethingroyal's other stakes winners were First Family, Sir Gaylord and Syrian Sea.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after its}} opening, {{concerns}} were {{raised about the}} bridge's safety. Following an inspection by John Hawkshaw and Edwin Clark in 1861, an additional support chain was added on each side. Despite the strengthening there were still concerns about its <b>soundness,</b> and a weight limit of 5 tons was imposed. At the same time, the name was changed from Victoria Bridge to Chelsea Bridge, as the government {{was concerned about the}} reliability of suspension bridges and did not want a potential collapse {{to be associated with the}} Queen.|$|E
5|$|The Bedouin {{way of life}} {{depended}} on camels and horses: Arabians were bred to be war horses with speed, endurance, <b>soundness,</b> and intelligence. Because many raids required stealth, mares were preferred over stallions as they were quieter, and therefore would not give away {{the position of the}} fighters. A good disposition was also critical; prized war mares were often brought inside family tents to prevent theft and for protection from weather and predators. Though appearance was not necessarily a survival factor, the Bedouin bred for refinement and beauty in their horses as well as for more practical features.|$|E
5|$|The {{argument}} from morality {{is an argument}} {{for the existence of}} God. Arguments from morality tend to be based on moral normativity or moral order. Arguments from moral normativity observe some aspect of morality and argue that God is the best or only explanation for this, concluding that God must exist. Arguments from moral order are based on the asserted need for moral order to exist in the universe. They claim that, for this moral order to exist, God must exist to support it. The {{argument from}} morality is noteworthy in that one cannot evaluate the <b>soundness</b> of the argument without attending to almost every important philosophical issue in meta-ethics.|$|E
5|$|William Heaven was {{succeeded by}} his son the Reverend Hudson Grosset Heaven who, thanks to a legacy from Sarah Langworthy (née Heaven), was able to fulfill his life's {{ambition}} of building a stone church on the island. St Helen's was completed in 1896, and stands today as a lasting memorial to the Heaven period. It has been designated by English Heritage a Grade II listed building. He {{is said to have}} been able to afford either a church or a new harbour. His choice of the church was not however in the best financial interests of the island. The unavailability of the money for re-establishing the family's financial <b>soundness,</b> coupled with disastrous investment and speculation in the early 20th century, caused severe financial hardship.|$|E
5|$|A high {{accident}} rate may also occur because Thoroughbreds, {{particularly in the}} United States, are first raced as 2-year-olds, well before they are completely mature. Though they may appear full-grown and are in superb muscular condition, their bones are not fully formed. However, catastrophic injury rates are higher in 4- and 5-year-olds than in 2- and 3-year-olds. Some believe that correct, slow training of a young horse (including foals) may actually be beneficial to the overall <b>soundness</b> of the animal. This is because, during the training process, microfractures occur in the leg followed by bone remodeling. If the remodeling is given sufficient time to heal, the bone becomes stronger. If proper remodeling occurs before hard training and racing begins, the horse will have a stronger musculoskeletal system and will have a decreased chance of injury.|$|E
5|$|A {{sequence}} of movements {{in which a}} horse takes a step with all four legs is called a stride. During each step, with each leg, a horse completes four movements: the swing phase, the grounding or impact, the support period and the thrust. While the horse uses muscles throughout its body to move, the legs perform the functions of absorbing impact, bearing weight, and providing thrust. Good movement is sound, symmetrical, straight, free and coordinated, all of which depend on many factors, including conformation, <b>soundness,</b> care and training of the horse, and terrain and footing. The proportions and length of the bones and muscles in the legs can significantly impact the way an individual horse moves. The angles of certain bones, especially in the hind leg, shoulders, and pasterns, also affect movement.|$|E
5|$|Archbishop Davidson had {{no doubts}} about Henson's doctrinal <b>soundness,</b> and {{persuaded him to}} issue a {{statement}} of faith to silence his critics. Davidson stated publicly that no fair-minded man could read consecutively a series of Henson's sermons without feeling that they had in him a brilliant and powerful teacher of the Christian faith. Gore and his followers were obliged to call off their protests. Against Davidson's advice for caution, Lloyd George appointed Henson to the vacant see of Hereford in 1917. Gore and others, including Cosmo Lang, now the Archbishop of York, failed to attend the consecration service. Their attitude hurt Henson, offended lay opinion in the Church, and was sharply criticised in The Times. Henson was consecrated bishop in Westminster Abbey on 4 February 1918 by Davidson, assisted by twelve supporting bishops. He was enthroned at Hereford Cathedral eight days later.|$|E
5|$|To {{prove the}} <b>soundness</b> of the IAe 33 design, two gliders built under {{contract}} by another expatriate, Reimar Horten, were constructed {{and used for}} aerodynamics testing in 1948–1949, including flights by Tank himself. These tests revealed significant problems with lateral stability, resulting in modifications to the tail {{to address this problem}} before construction began on two prototype airframes. Due to the lack of modern machinery, the all-metal fabrication relied heavily on handcrafting, and fabricating the prototypes was a labor-intensive procedure. President Perón envisioned that a benefit of setting up an aviation factory in Argentina would be to introduce production standards comparable to world-class manufacturing facilities. However, Tank realized that production tools and jigs were not feasible at this stage and relied instead on essentially hand-built examples. The first airframe (No. 01) reserved for static testing, was subsequently destroyed during the tests.|$|E
25|$|For {{breeding}} gilts, {{the traits}} {{by order of}} importance are: Structure and <b>soundness,</b> Growth, Underline quality, Capacity or volume, Degree of muscling, Degree of leanness.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{scholars}} have criticised historical Jesus research for religious bias {{and lack of}} methodological <b>soundness,</b> and {{some have argued that}} modern biblical scholarship is insufficiently critical and sometimes amounts to covert apologetics.|$|E
25|$|Scholars have debated {{a number}} of broad {{issues related to the}} {{parallels}} drawn between Jesus and other myths, e.g. the very existence of the category dying-and-rising god was debated throughout the 20th century, some modern scholars questioning the <b>soundness</b> of the category. At the end of the 20th century the overall scholarly consensus had emerged against the <b>soundness</b> of the reasoning used to suggest the category. Tryggve Mettinger (who supports the category) states that there is a scholarly consensus that the category is inappropriate from a historical perspective. Scholars such as Kurt Rudolph have stated the reasoning used for the construction of the category has been defective.|$|E
25|$|Self-adapting {{capabilities}} of the hooves show their maximal effectiveness in wild equids (but domesticated horses show this too, to a lesser extent), {{as shown by the}} perfect <b>soundness</b> of feral horses, such as Mustangs, {{in a wide variety of}} environments.|$|E
25|$|The {{college is}} {{ranked in the}} top 17% (154) of 925 colleges and {{universities}} in Forbes College Financial Grades rankings of financial fitness. This ranking is based on balance sheet health, operational <b>soundness,</b> admissions yield, freshmen receiving institutional grants, and instructional expenses per student.|$|E
25|$|The last Quality Assurance Agency {{institutional}} audit for the University was in March 2009. The {{outcome was}} that 'confidence can reasonably {{be placed in}} the <b>soundness</b> of the institution's present and likely future management of the academic standards of the awards that it offers'.|$|E
25|$|This {{deduction}} theorem (DT) is {{not itself}} formulated with propositional calculus: {{it is not}} a theorem of propositional calculus, but a theorem about propositional calculus. In this sense, it is a meta-theorem, comparable to theorems about the <b>soundness</b> or completeness of propositional calculus.|$|E
25|$|Swine judging is {{the process}} of {{selectively}} ordering swine or domestic pigs {{in order to determine the}} best pig. For market hogs, traits are ranked in order of their importance: Degree of muscling, growth, capacity or volume, degree of leanness, structure and <b>soundness.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Design {{structure}} matrix (DSM) can model process relations, and {{be utilized}} for process planning. The DSM-nets are realization of DSM-based plans into workflow processes by Petri nets, and are equivalent to WRI-WF-nets. The DSM-net construction process ensures the <b>soundness</b> {{property of the}} resulting net.|$|E
25|$|In grading {{lumber and}} {{structural}} timber, knots are classified {{according to their}} form, size, <b>soundness,</b> and the firmness {{with which they are}} held in place. This firmness is affected by, among other factors, the length of time for which the branch was dead while the attaching stem continued to grow.|$|E
25|$|The Howard Francis Self-Loading Carbine was a {{conversion}} of a No. 1 Mk III to the 7.63×25mm Mauser pistol cartridge. It fired in semi-automatic only and suffered some feeding and extraction problems and, despite meeting accuracy and <b>soundness</b> of design concept, {{never made it}} past the prototype stage.|$|E
25|$|Canada's {{dollar is}} the fifth most held reserve {{currency}} in the world, accounting for approximately 2% of all global reserves, behind only the U.S. dollar, the euro, the yen and the pound sterling. The Canadian dollar is popular with central banks because of Canada's relative economic <b>soundness,</b> the Canadian government's strong sovereign position, and {{the stability of the}} country's legal and political systems.|$|E
25|$|The {{registry}} institutes {{the same}} studbook inspection process, {{aiming for a}} powerful, elegant horse about 15.2hh with an active, efficient trot, longevity, <b>soundness,</b> and an even temperament. While greys and chestnuts are permitted, discretely marked black, brown, and dark bay horses are preferred. Heavy warmbloods bred at Moritzburg are just as suitable for driving and leisure as those bred elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|Today, the {{missions}} exist {{in varying degrees}} of architectural integrity and structural <b>soundness.</b> The most common extant features at the mission grounds include the church building and an ancillary convento (convent) wing. In some cases (in San Rafael, Santa Cruz, and Soledad, for example), the current buildings are replicas constructed {{on or near the}} original site. Other mission compounds remain relatively intact and true to their original, Mission Era construction.|$|E
25|$|The {{university}} {{is made up}} of a number of faculties and academies. It is categorised into three main cluster namely business and management; social sciences and humanities; and science and technology. The Academic Affairs Division, headed by a Deputy Vice-Chancellor, is responsible to ensure the <b>soundness</b> of the academic programs as well as the robust, uniform and standardised academic delivery throughout the whole UiTM system across the nation.|$|E
25|$|I {{have been}} born with four dispositions well adapted for making {{progress}} in science, but with two great defects in the faculties necessary for that purpose. 1. An ardent desire to know the truth; 2. Great activity of mind; 3. An uncommon (justesse) <b>soundness</b> of understanding; 4. A strong desire for precision and distinctness of ideas; 5. An excessive weakness of memory; 6. A great incapacity of continued attention.|$|E
25|$|Logic is {{the study}} of the {{principles}} of valid reasoning and inference, as well as of consistency, <b>soundness,</b> and completeness. For example, in most systems of logic (but not in intuitionistic logic) Peirce's law (((P→Q)→P)→P) is a theorem. For classical logic, it can be easily verified with a truth table. The study of mathematical proof is particularly important in logic, and has applications to automated theorem proving and formal verification of software.|$|E
25|$|Concerns {{about the}} <b>soundness</b> of {{arguments}} involving infinitesimals {{date back to}} ancient Greek mathematics, with Archimedes replacing such proofs with ones using other techniques such as the method of exhaustion. In the 1960s, Abraham Robinson proved that the hyperreals were logically consistent {{if and only if}} the reals were. This put to rest the fear that any proof involving infinitesimals might be unsound, provided that they were manipulated according to the logical rules that Robinson delineated.|$|E
25|$|Bank {{regulation}} in the United States is highly fragmented {{compared to other}} G10 countries where most countries have only one bank regulator. In the U.S., banking is regulated at both {{the federal and state}} level. The U.S. also {{has one of the most}} highly regulated banking environments in the world; however, many of the regulations are not <b>soundness</b> related, but are instead focused on privacy, disclosure, fraud prevention, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, anti-usury lending, and promoting lending to lower-income segments.|$|E
25|$|Horseshoes {{have long}} been viewed {{as an aid to}} assist horses' hooves when {{subjected}} to the various unnatural conditions brought about by domestication, whether due to work conditions or stabling and management. Many generations of domestic horses bred for size, color, speed, and other traits with little regard for hoof quality and <b>soundness</b> make some breeds more dependent on horseshoes than feral horses such as mustangs, which develop strong hooves as a matter of natural selection.|$|E
25|$|Quality and <b>soundness</b> of {{the chain}} of narrators of the {{selected}} ahādīth. Muhammad al-Bukhari has followed two principle criteria for selecting sound narratives. First, the lifetime of a narrator should overlap with the lifetime of the authority from whom he narrates. Second, it should be verifiable that narrators have met with their source persons. They should also expressly state that they obtained the narrative from these authorities. This is a stricter criterion than that set by Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj.|$|E
25|$|Bask's sire was Witraz, by {{the famed}} Ofir, who also sired Witez II. His dam was Balalajka, a {{daughter}} of Amurath-Sahib, deemed one of Poland's finest broodmares. He {{was sent to the}} race track, as it was typical in the time for horses to be sent to race as three-year-olds {{in order to determine the}} horse's athletic ability and <b>soundness.</b> In 1961, Albigowa ceased breeding Arabians, so after his horse racing career, Bask was sent to the Janow Podlaski stud.|$|E
25|$|Prima Paint {{attracted}} little {{analysis and}} commentary in its time, {{but as it}} became {{the foundation for the}} Court's expansion of the scope of the Arbitration Act and its subsequent application to contracts between consumers and businesses as well as among businesses, its reasoning {{has been the subject of}} more legal papers. Critics have reiterated Black's concerns in focusing on how the later decisions have exposed fundamental flaws in Prima Paint, while defenders have found them to reinforce its fundamental <b>soundness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Virtually all New Testament {{scholars}} and Near East historians, applying the standard criteria of historical investigation, {{find that the}} historicity of Jesus is effectively certain although they differ about the beliefs and teachings of Jesus {{as well as the}} accuracy of the details of his life that have been described in the gospels. While scholars have criticized Jesus scholarship for religious bias and lack of methodological <b>soundness,</b> with very few exceptions such critics generally do support the historicity of Jesus and reject the Christ myth theory that Jesus never existed.|$|E
25|$|What was {{required}} of horses {{as part of}} transport was affected by similar advances: the advent of long-distance public stagecoach travel in the 16th century, {{the invention of the}} steam engine, and mechanization. Pulling stage coaches did not necessitate beauty, but endurance, efficiency and <b>soundness.</b> Large-scale train transport in Germany took hold late in the 19th century and significantly reduced the need for stage horses. More elegant carriage horses with high-stepping gaits became more popular for short-distance traveling, as did saddle horses. Once again, mechanization all but negated the horse's role in transport.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} a formal theorem is {{fundamentally}} syntactic, {{in contrast to the}} notion of a true proposition, which introduces semantics. Different deductive systems can yield other interpretations, depending on the presumptions of the derivation rules (i.e. belief, justification or other modalities). The <b>soundness</b> of a formal system depends on whether or not all of its theorems are also validities. A validity is a formula that is true under any possible interpretation, e.g. in classical propositional logic validities are tautologies. A formal system is considered semantically complete when all of its tautologies are also theorems.|$|E
