25|$|Thy-1 can be {{considered}} as a <b>surrogate</b> <b>marker</b> for various kind of stem cells (e.g. hematopoietic stem cells or HSCs). It is one of the popular combinatorial surface markers for FACS for stem cells in combination with other markers like CD34. In humans, Thy-1 is expressed on neurons and HSCs among others. It is considered a major marker of HSC pluripotency in concordance with CD34. In human HSCs, Thy1 cells are all CD34 positive. Thy 1 is also a marker of other kind of stem cells, for example: mesenchymal stem cells, hepatic stem cells ("oval cells"), keratinocyte stem cells, putative endometrial progenitor/(?)stem cells.|$|E
40|$|In {{the latter}} half of the 20 th century efforts to improve medical care became known as the quality movement. Although these efforts were often touted as “{{evidence}}-based”, the evidence was often weak or nonexistent. We review the history of the quality movement. Although patient-centered outcomes were initially examined, these were replaced with <b>surrogate</b> <b>markers.</b> Many of the <b>surrogate</b> <b>markers</b> were weakly or non-evidence based interventions. Furthermore, the <b>surrogate</b> <b>markers</b> were often “bundled”, some evidence-based and some not. These guidelines, <b>surrogate</b> <b>markers</b> and bundles were rarely subjected to beta testing, and when carefully scrutinized, rarely correlated with improved patient-centered outcomes. Based on this lack of improvement in outcomes, the quality movement has not improved healthcare. Furthermore, the quality movement will not likely improve clinical performance until recommended or required interventions are tested using randomized trials...|$|R

25|$|In 2007 the FDA {{required}} all antidepressants {{to carry}} a black box warning stating that antidepressants may {{increase the risk of}} suicide in people younger than 25. This warning is based on statistical analyses conducted by two independent groups of FDA experts that found a 2-fold increase of the suicidal ideation and behavior in children and adolescents, and 1.5-fold increase of suicidality in the 18–24 age group. The suicidality was slightly decreased for those older than 24, and statistically significantly lower in the 65 and older group. This analysis was criticized by Donald Klein, who noted that suicidality, that is suicidal ideation and behavior, is not necessarily a good <b>surrogate</b> <b>marker</b> for completed suicide, and it is still possible that antidepressants may prevent actual suicide while increasing suicidality.|$|E

40|$|High {{failure rates}} of metal-on-metal hip {{arthroplasty}} implants have highlighted {{the need for}} more careful introduction and monitoring of new implants and for the evaluation of the safety of medical devices. The National Joint Registry and other regulatory services are unable to detect failing implants at an early enough stage. We aimed to identify validated <b>surrogate</b> <b>markers</b> of long-term outcome in patients undergoing primary total hip arthroplasty (THA). We conducted a systematic review of studies evaluating <b>surrogate</b> <b>markers</b> for predicting long-term outcome in primary THA. Long-term outcome was defined as revision rate of an implant at ten years according to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence guidelines. We conducted a search of Medline and Embase (OVID) databases. Separate search strategies were devised for the Cochrane database and Google Scholar. Each search was performed to include articles from the date of their inception to June 8, 2015. Our search strategy identified 1082 studies of which 115 studies were included for full article review. Following review, 17 articles were found that investigated <b>surrogate</b> <b>markers</b> of long-term outcome. These included one systematic review, one randomised control trial (RCT), one case control study and 13 case series. Validated <b>surrogate</b> <b>markers</b> included Radiostereometric Analysis (RSA) and Einzel-Bild-Röntgen-Analyse (EBRA), each measuring implant migration and wear. We identified five RSA studies (one systematic review and four case series) and four EBRA studies (one RCT and three case series). Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) at six months have been investigated but have not been validated against long-term outcomes. This systematic review identified two validated <b>surrogate</b> <b>markers</b> of long-term primary THA outcome: RSA and EBRA, each measuring implant migration and wear. We recommend the consideration of RSA in the pre-market testing of new implants. EBRA can be used to investigate acetabular wear but not femoral migration. Further studies are needed to validate the use of PROMs for post-market surveillance...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Macular oedema is not {{directly}} visible on digital photographs used in screening. Photographic <b>surrogate</b> <b>markers</b> are used to detect patients who may have macular oedema. Evidence suggests that only around 10 % of patients with these <b>surrogate</b> <b>markers</b> referred to an ophthalmologist have macular oedema when examined by slit-lamp biomicroscopy. Purpose: The purpose of this audit was {{to determine how many}} patients with <b>surrogate</b> <b>markers</b> were truly identified by optical coherence tomography (OCT) as having macular oedema. Method: Data were collected from patients attending digital diabetic retinopathy screening. Patients who presented with <b>surrogate</b> <b>markers</b> for macular oedema also had an OCT scan. The fast macula scan on the Stratus OCT was used and an ophthalmologist reviewed the scans to determine whether macular oedema was present. Results: Out of 66 patients with maculopathy defined as haemorrhages or microaneurysms within one optic disc diameter (DD) of the fovea and visual acuity (VA) worse than 6 / 9 11 (17 %) showed thickening on the OCT, only 4 (6 %) had macular oedema. None required laser. Out of 155 patients with maculopathy defined as any exudate within one DD of the fovea or circinate within two DD 45 (29 %) showed thickening on the OCT of these 27 % required laser. Conclusion: OCT is a useful tool in screening to help identify those who need a true referral to ophthalmology for maculopathy. If exudate is present the chance of having macular oedema and requiring laser treatment is greater than the presence of microaneurysms within one DD and reduced VA...|$|R
