5|$|It is {{possible}} that a panmictic (random mating) wolf population, with gene flow spanning Eurasia and North America, existed until {{the closing of the}} ice sheets, after which the southern wolves became isolated, and only the Beringian wolf existed north of the sheets. The land bridge became inundated by the sea 10,000YBP, and the ice sheets receded 12,000â€”6,000YBP. The Beringian wolf became extinct, and the southern wolves expanded through the shrinking ice <b>sheets</b> <b>to</b> recolonize the northern part of North America. All North American wolves are descended from those that were once isolated south of the ice sheets. However, much of their diversity was later lost during the twentieth century due to eradication.|$|E
5|$|Johnson had {{purchased}} the car from a junkyard in 1956. Johnson and his son, Craig, would restore {{the car as}} a father-son project while Craig attended the Georgia Military Academy. The two spent two years and over $1,800 restoring the vehicle. Johnson utilized spare parts from many different sources to refurbish the rusty hulk. He bought the mahogany dash from a parts dealer in Caracas, Venezuela and used Convair 440 aluminum <b>sheets</b> <b>to</b> replace the flooring. After Craig graduated from high school, he attended Florida State on a track scholarship. In 1960, Craig's track team would be in Atlanta competing against Tech. Johnson, wanting to see his son compete, took the Model A to Tech campus, parked it near Towers dormitory, and went to watch Craig compete.|$|E
5|$|Way {{moved to}} Washington, D.C., in 1949, {{where she went}} to work for the National Bureau of Standards. Four years later, she persuaded the National Academy of Sciences' National Research Council to {{establish}} the Nuclear Data Project (NDP), an organization with special responsibility for gathering and disseminating nuclear data, under her leadership. The NDP moved to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 1964, but Way remained its head until 1968. Beginning in 1964, the NDP published a journal, Nuclear Data <b>Sheets,</b> <b>to</b> disseminate the information that the NDP had gathered. This was joined the following year by a second journal, Atomic Data and Nuclear Data Tables. She also persuaded the editors of Nuclear Physics to add keywords to the subject headings of articles to facilitate cross-referencing.|$|E

5|$|The {{trend of}} {{accelerating}} {{the speed at}} which welds are performed in the steel erection industry comes at a risk to the integrity of the connection. Without proper fusion to the base materials provided by sufficient arc time on the weld, a project inspector cannot ensure the effective diameter of the puddle weld therefore he or she cannot guarantee the published load capacities unless they witness the actual installation. This method of puddle welding is common in the United States and Canada for attaching steel <b>sheets</b> <b>to</b> bar joist and structural steel members. Regional agencies are responsible for ensuring the proper installation of puddle welding on steel construction sites. Currently there is no standard or weld procedure which can ensure the published holding capacity of any unwitnessed connection, but this is under review by the American Welding Society.|$|E

25|$|The {{geological}} record {{appears to}} show that ice ages start when the continents are in positions which block or reduce the flow of warm water from the equator to the poles and thus allow ice <b>sheets</b> <b>to</b> form. The ice sheets increase Earth's reflectivity and thus reduce the absorption of solar radiation. With less radiation absorbed the atmosphere cools; the cooling allows the ice <b>sheets</b> <b>to</b> grow, which further increases reflectivity in a positive feedback loop. The ice age continues until the reduction in weathering causes {{an increase in the}} greenhouse effect.|$|E

50|$|On small sailboats {{and some}} {{cruising}} sailboats a vang may be omitted. If a vang is not installed, then the <b>sheet</b> has <b>to</b> {{try to control}} both horizontal and vertical angles of the boom. When the boom is near the centerline, the sheet is nearly vertical, and can exert downward force on the boom. As the <b>sheet</b> is loosened <b>to</b> increase the horizontal angle of the boom and sail, the sheet becomes horizontal and exerts less downward force. A vang works with the <b>sheet</b> <b>to</b> apply the downward force on the boom at all horizontal angles, allowing the <b>sheet</b> <b>to</b> be used to control the horizontal angle of the boom effectively.|$|R

25|$|In {{the process}} of manufacture, {{silicate}} glass can be poured, formed, extruded and molded into forms ranging from flat <b>sheets</b> <b>to</b> highly intricate shapes. The finished product is brittle and will fracture, unless laminated or specially treated, but is extremely durable under most conditions. It erodes very slowly and can mostly withstand the action of water. It is mostly resistant to chemical attack, does not react with foods, and is an ideal material for the manufacture of containers for foodstuffs and most chemicals. Glass is also a fairly inert substance.|$|E

25|$|In the USA, {{on average}} {{one third of}} grade A {{students}} have cheated. And asserts that academic dishonesty acts as a shortcut, so even grade A students {{might be tempted to}} cheat. He contends that even if a plagiarized paper receives a relatively low grade, that grade is actually high, given how much time and effort went into the paper. In the study mentioned above (in which students were allowed to bring crib <b>sheets</b> <b>to</b> a test but did not improve their scores), the researcher concluded that the students used the crib notes as alternatives to studying, rather than as complements to studying, and thus spent less time preparing for the exam.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{theories}} about migration into the Americas have centered on migration from Beringia through {{the interior of}} North America. The discovery of artifacts in association with Pleistocene faunal remains near Clovis, New Mexico in the early 1930s required extension of the timeframe for the settlement of North America to the period during which glaciers were still extensive. That led to the hypothesis of a migration route between the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice <b>sheets</b> <b>to</b> explain the early settlement. The Clovis site was host to a lithic technology characterized by spear points with an indentation, or flute, where the point {{was attached to the}} shaft. A lithic complex characterized by the Clovis Point technology was subsequently identified over much of North America and in South America. The association of Clovis complex technology with late Pleistocene faunal remains led to the theory that it marked the arrival of big game hunters that migrated out of Beringia then dispersed throughout the Americas, otherwise known as the Clovis First theory.|$|E

25|$|Fly rods are, {{in modern}} manufacture, almost always {{built out of}} carbon {{graphite}}. The graphite fibres are laid down in increasingly sophisticated patterns to keep the rod from flattening when stressed (usually referred to as hoop strength). The rod tapers {{from one end to}} the other and the degree of taper determines how much of the rod flexes when stressed. The larger amount of the rod that flexes the 'slower' the rod. Slower rods are easier to cast, create lighter presentations but create a wider loop on the forward cast that reduces casting distance and is subject to the effects of wind. Furthermore, the process of wrapping graphite fibre <b>sheets</b> <b>to</b> build a rod creates imperfections that result in rod twist during casting. Rod twist is minimized by orienting the rod guides along the side of the rod with the most 'give'. This is done by flexing the rod and feeling for the point of most give or by using computerized rod testing.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} 45-minute {{practice}} session, Pommer fought with Rosenqvist and Leclerc {{for the top}} spot until the former set a benchmark past the mid-point of the session and the time he set of two minutes and 11.102 (which was the fastest of the race meeting at that point) remained fastest until {{the conclusion of the}} second practice session. Rosenqvist followed three-tenths of a second adrift in second while Leclerc continued his progression up the time <b>sheets</b> <b>to</b> place third. Giovinazzi was the last driver to be within one second of the pace set by Pommer's in fourth while Stroll was fifth. Juncadella took sixth and was in front of Dennis, Jensen and the British pairing of MacLeod and Ilott. Three crashes occurred during the session as Stroll went straight into the barriers at the Melco hairpin and Boccalacci triggered the session's sole stoppage when he made an error and heavily damaged his car by clouting the wall at the exit of San Francisco Bend. Cao lost control of his vehicle at Paiol corner and damaged his right-hand side suspension in an impact with the barrier but managed to limp back to the pit lane for repairs.|$|E
25|$|While imprisoned, Hamilton Rowan met the Reverend William Jackson, an Irish-born Anglican clergyman who {{was working}} as a spy for the French Committee of Public Safety. Jackson's mission was to assess Ireland's {{readiness}} for revolution and French invasion. Jackson, Tone, and others met in Hamilton Rowan's Newgate cell to discuss the state of Ireland and the population's willingness to overthrow British rule. But Jackson was betrayed by a friend acting as a spy for the British Government, {{was arrested and charged with}} high treason. Immediately following Jackson's arrest, Hamilton Rowan fled to escape being tried for high treason. He convinced his jailer to allow him to visit his wife on the pretense of signing legal documents. While the jailer sat in the dining room of their home in Dublin, Hamilton Rowan excused himself to the bedroom, where he climbed down a rope made of knotted bed <b>sheets</b> <b>to</b> a waiting horse. Unwilling to be taken alive, he kept a razor blade in his sleeve and fled south to the coast. There he hired a boat to sail to France, and upon his arrival he was immediately arrested as a British spy. While in prison he was interrogated by Robespierre, who found him innocent of the charges raised against him and had Hamilton Rowan freed.|$|E
