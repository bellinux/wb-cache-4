5000|$|The {{earliest}} of the Breton lais {{to survive}} is probably The Lais of Marie de France, {{thought to have}} been composed in the 1170s by Marie de France, a French poet writing in England at Henry II's court between the late 12th and early 13th centuries. From descriptions in Marie's lais, and in several anonymous Old French lais of the 13th century, we know of earlier lais of Celtic origin, perhaps more lyrical in style, sung by Breton minstrels. It is believed that these Breton lyrical lais, none of which has survived, were introduced by a <b>summary</b> <b>narrative</b> setting the scene for a song, and that these summaries became the basis for the narrative lais.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a <b>summary</b> <b>narrative</b> account and critique {{of changes in}} aviation security issues and practices in Australia in the post- 9 / 11 environment. In the past decade many millions of dollars have been injected into airport security upgrades on the recommendations of govemment-sponsored reviews, most notably the 2005 Wheeler Review. However, security problems continue to be identified, including a lack of coordination of police, inadequate entry and,exit controls outside the main passenger access points, {{and a lack of}} controls at regional airpmis. The paper argues that a key implication of these findings is that standard principles of security management need to be more systematically built into the planning and management of critical infi·astructure security, with enhanced training in security management for key personnel. ...|$|E
40|$|The third book in "The Labour Governments 1964 - 70 " series, {{this text}} {{concentrates}} on Britain's economic policy under Britain's Labour {{governments in the}} 1960 s. It assesses the origins, development and outcomes of the attempts by Harold Wilson's Labour governments to modernize the British economy. The book places the project {{in the context of}} Labour's economic ideas as they had developed since the 1940 s as well as the economic legacy they inherited from the previous 13 years of Conservative rule. After outlining this context and providing a <b>summary</b> <b>narrative</b> of economic policy over this period, Labour's approach to the international economy is analysed. The core of the book then goes on to look in detail at the policies directly concerned with modernization. Following the agenda set by the National Plan of 1965, policies on planning, investment, technical change, the labour market and the nationalized industries are all considered. In addition, the productivity campaign of the late 1960 s is shown to have encapsulated many of the underlying ideas and problems of Labour's approach to economic policy. The final section of the book asks how the pursuit of modernization affected Labour's commitment to "social justice", before offering an overall assessment of Labour's period of office. This book should be of particular interest to contemporary historians, economic historians and those interested {{in the history of the}} Labour party. Together with the other books in the series, on domestic policy and international policy, it provides a complete picture of the development of Britian under the premiership of Harold Wilson...|$|E

40|$|The U. S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has {{recorded}} 8, 436 rotorcraft accidents {{during the period}} mid - 1963 {{through the end of}} 1997. Review and analysis of the NTSB <b>summary</b> <b>narrative</b> for each accident has been completed. In addition, FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) counts of the growing registered rotorcraft fleet over this period has obtained. Taken together, a large and informative data base is now available, which indicates that the accident rate (on a per airframe basis) has changed very little since the mid 1970 s. The data base, even in the summary form provided by this paper, offers suggestions for safer designs and improved flight operations. For analysis purposes, each accident has been placed in one of 21 top level categories as defined by the NTSB. Analysis of this grouping shows that 70 percent of rotorcraft accidents are associated with four categories. The accident count in these top four categories are: (1) 2, 408 Loss of engine power (2) 1, 322 In flight collision with object (3) 1, 114 Loss of control (4) 1, 083 Airframe/component/system failure or malfunction. Single engine rotorcraft dominate these accident statistics because of their sheer numbers over the study period. One-third of the loss of engine power accidents with these aircraft is fuel/air mixture related and fuel exhaustion is a common event. This appears to be the case whether a piston or turbine engine is installed. This paper provides similar study results in the other major mishap categories. It shows that both minor and major design and flight operations changes can [...] and should [...] be made to reduce rotorcraft accidents in the future. The paper outlines these changes and suggests how they may be made...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} {{risk factors}} independently predictive of pressure injury (also known as pressure ulcer) development among critical-care patients. Design: We undertook a systematic review of primary research based on standardized criteria {{set forth by}} the Institute of Medicine. Data sources: We searched the following databases: CINAHL (EBSCOhost), the Cochrane Library (Wilson), Dissertations 2 ̆ 6 Theses Global (ProQuest), PubMed (National Library of Medicine), and Scopus. There was no language restriction. Method: A research librarian coordinated the search strategy. Articles that potentially met inclusion criteria were screened by two investigators. Among the articles that met selection criteria, one investigator extracted data and a second investigator reviewed the data for accuracy. Based on a literature search, we developed a tool for assessing study quality {{using a combination of}} currently available tools and expert input. We used the method developed by Coleman et al. in 2014 to generate evidence tables and a <b>summary</b> <b>narrative</b> synthesis by domain and subdomain. Results: Of 1753 abstracts reviewed, 158 were identified as potentially eligible and 18 fulfilled eligibility criteria. Five studies were classified as high quality, two were moderate quality, nine were low quality, and two were of very low quality. Age, mobility/activity, perfusion, and vasopressor infusion emerged as important risk factors for pressure injury development, whereas results for risk categories that are theoretically important, including nutrition, and skin/pressure injury status, were mixed. Methodological limitations across studies limited the generalizability of the results, and future research is needed, particularly to evaluate risk conferred by altered nutrition and skin/pressure injury status, and to further elucidate the effects of perfusion-related variables. Conclusions: Results underscore the importance of avoiding overinterpretation of a single study, and the importance of taking study quality into consideration when reviewing risk factors. Maximal pressure injury prevention efforts are particularly important among critical-care patients who are older, have altered mobility, experience poor perfusion, or who are receiving a vasopressor infusion...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} {{risk factors}} independently predictive of pressure ulcer development in adult patient populations? Design: A systematic review of primary research was undertaken, based upon methods recommended for effectiveness questions but adapted to identify observational risk factor studies. Data sources: Fourteen electronic databases were searched, each from inception until March 2010, with hand searching of specialist journals and conference proceedings; contact with experts and a citation search. There was no language restriction. Review methods: Abstracts were screened, reviewed against the eligibility criteria, data extracted and quality appraised {{by at least}} one reviewer and checked by a second. Where necessary, statistical review was undertaken. We developed an assessment framework and quality classification based upon guidelines for assessing quality and methodological considerations in the analysis, meta-analysis and publication of observational studies. Studies were classified as high, moderate, low and very low quality. Risk factors were categorised into risk factor domains and sub-domains. Evidence tables were generated and a <b>summary</b> <b>narrative</b> synthesis by sub-domain and domain was undertaken. Results: Of 5462 abstracts retrieved, 365 were identified as potentially eligible and 54 fulfilled the eligibility criteria. The 54 studies included 34, 449 patients and acute and community patient populations. Seventeen studies were classified as high or moderate quality, whilst 37 studies (68. 5 %) had inadequate numbers of pressure ulcers and other methodological limitations. Risk factors emerging most frequently as independent predictors of pressure ulcer development included three primary domains of mobility/ activity, perfusion (including diabetes) and skin/pressure ulcer status. Skin moisture, age, haematological measures, nutrition and general health status are also important, but did not emerge as frequently as the three main domains. Body temperature and immunity may be important but require further confirmatory research. There is limited evidence that either race or gender is important. Conclusions: Overall there is no single factor which can explain pressure ulcer risk, rather a complex interplay of factors which increase the probability of pressure ulcer development. The review highlights the limitations of over-interpretation of results from individual studies and the benefits of reviewing results from a number of studies to develop a more reliable overall assessment of factors which are important in affecting patient susceptibility...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} whether family physicians prefer discharge <b>summaries</b> in <b>narrative</b> or standardized format {{and to determine}} factors affecting this preference. DESIGN: Mailed survey. SETTING: Internal medicine ward at a teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Random sample of 180 family physicians practising in the Ottawa-Carleton area. Of the original sample, 20 were not family physicians and were excluded. Of the 160 physicians remaining, 126 responded for {{a response rate of}} 78. 8 %. INTERVENTION: For a stratified random sample of patients, medical records and <b>narrative</b> discharge <b>summaries</b> were abstracted using a data acquisition form to capture essential information. Information on completed forms was transformed into standardized summaries. Physicians were sent both <b>narrative</b> and standardized <b>summaries.</b> MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Physicians' format preference as indicated on an ordinal 7 -point scale. RESULTS: The standardized format was preferred with a score of 4. 28 versus 3. 84 for the narrative (P <. 05). Responses indicated the standardized format provided information most relevant to ongoing care, with a mean score of 4. 82 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 4. 48 to 5. 15), and easier access to summary information (5. 60, CI 5. 30 to 5. 89). The <b>narrative</b> <b>summary</b> better described patients' admission (3. 54, CI 3. 18 to 3. 90). Preference for standardized summaries correlated with lengthier <b>narrative</b> <b>summary</b> (P <. 05), shorter length of stay (P <. 05), and physicians' dissatisfaction with previous summaries (P <. 001). Standardized discharge summaries were significantly shorter (302 versus 619 words, P =. 004) than <b>narrative</b> <b>summaries.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Physicians preferred a standardized format for discharge summaries.
