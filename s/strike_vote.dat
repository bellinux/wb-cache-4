The union's strike committee declined to give Murray the authority to sign a wage pact without approval of the union's membership, and set its next meeting for January 3, 1952. The strike committee's action, requested by Murray, was designed to make calling off a strike much more difficult and thus spur bargaining.|$|E

[...] The new General Strike Committee had already written up the motion. [...] You would recognize many of the names on that strike committee: Jack Shelly, A.

[...] Throngs mulled about the Labor Temple at Sixteenth and Capp streets during four hours…” Finally, a hod carrier by the name of Joe Murphy made the motion.|$|E

2500|$|In 1989, Carey {{announced}} that he would run for president of the Teamsters union. Carey was highly critical of the UPS contract that the Teamsters, led by interim General President William J. McCarthy, had negotiated in 1990. Carey's local represented more than 6,600 members at UPS, making it largest Teamsters local within the company, and Carey's criticism of the contract carried great weight within the international union. Carey also criticized McCarthy for refusing to call for a <b>strike</b> <b>vote</b> prior to ratification, for not adequately communicating the [...] "concessionary" [...] nature of the contract to Teamster members, and for helping oversee the loss of nearly 800,000 Teamsters members in the past decade. In mid-October 1990, McCarthy, suffering from health problems and losing support within the union for his handling of various contract negotiations, announced he would not seek a full term as Teamsters president. Endorsed by Teamsters for a Democratic Union (TDU), a member-led reform caucus, Carey ran for General President on a pledge to eliminate corruption and organized crime's influence in the union. Utilizing TDU's national mailing list, he raised $200,000 in mostly small contributions from Teamsters members and criss-crossed the country by car to meet with the union's membership.|$|E

The NLRB processed 2,000 WLDA cases from 1943 to the end of 1945, of which 500 were strike votes.

[...] The AFL amended its constitution to disallow any central labor union (i.e., regional labor councils) from [...] "taking a <b>strike</b> <b>vote</b> without prior authorization of the national officers of the union concerned."

40|$|This article locates strike ballot laws at the {{intersection}} of two of labour law’s primary goals, promoting collective bargaining by responsible unions and reducing industrial conflict. Depending on their design, strike ballot laws may aim to protect democratic voice or to create an obstacle to engaging in lawful strikes. Strike ballot requirements in Canada were initially imposed during World War II primarily to reduce industrial conflict. The requirement was controversial and after the war most provinces opted not to make a strike ballot a condition of lawful strike action. Between the 1960 s and the late 1990 s, however, <b>strike</b> ballot <b>votes</b> became universally required in private sector collective bargaining laws. Focusing on three Canadian jurisdictions, this article explores the circumstances in which these laws were enacted and the forms they took. Overall, the article finds that Canadian strike ballot laws do not unduly burden unions when they seek a mandate to conduct a lawful strike from their members and that they have been interpreted by labour boards and courts as a way to protect trade union democracy rather than to limit industrial conflict. For this reason, the issue of <b>strike</b> <b>votes</b> is not currently a controversial topic in Canada...|$|R
