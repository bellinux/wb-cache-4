40|$|AbstractIn {{industrial}} manufacturing systems, {{situations are}} often encounters in which motion with two, {{three or more}} hydraulic cylinder actuators need to be synchronized.

This paper describes the concept of the design of the control system that will allow the controlling of pressure, flow and synchronous cylinder movements, accompanied by position readings measured by position sensors. The system will work simultaneously; with a maximum assembled of units working together, typically in a number that fits the operation's needs. The aim of the proposed controller is to develop a position control system that incorporates features of a modular controller interfacing with position sensors and detecting the position of the hydraulic cylinder rod through commercially-of-the-shelf (COTS) components...|$|R

5000|$|A Herbarium vivum (plural Herbaria viva) is a {{collection}} of plants and images, and their descriptions from a particular locality. The images were produced by a process doubtless suggested by engraving and lithography whereby an object coated with printer's ink or other <b>suitable</b> substance, is <b>pressed</b> onto paper, leaving behind an impression. An earlier method had used the lampblack derived from the sooty flame of a candle or lamp. The impression could then be painted over in colour with the certainty that form and size had been accurately fixed.

50|$|Watt {{started to}} develop the process in 1779, and made many {{experiments}} to formulate the ink, select the thin paper, to devise a method for wetting the special thin paper, {{and to make a}} <b>press</b> <b>suitable</b> for applying the correct pressure to effect the transfer. All of these required much experimentation, but he soon had enough success to patent the process a year later. Watt formed another partnership with Boulton (who provided financing) and James Keir (to manage the business) in a firm called James Watt and Co. The perfection of the invention required much more development work before it could be routinely used by others, but this was carried out over the next few years. Boulton and Watt gave up their shares to their sons in 1794. It became a commercial success and was widely used in offices even into the twentieth century.|$|R

40|$|Aluminium alloys 6082. 25 and 7021. 50 were {{evaluated}} and compared as potential base materials for processing by press form hardening. Both extruded profiles and rolled sheets were assessed, however the rolled 7021 material was neglected {{early in the}} project due to time constraints. The effect of deformation at the relevant high temperatures and strain rates on the workability and microstructure of the materials was assessed. The artificial age hardening response subsequent to hot deformation was investigated for the 6082 rolled material. The flow stress and workability of all investigated materials was highly favorable for forming at all temperatures relevant to press form hardening. These properties were most favorable at the solution heat treatment temperatures of the respective alloys. Materials that do not recrystallize during solution heat treatment appeared to give an advantageous grain structure in the finished parts. The extruded materials in this work did not recrystallize in bulk during solution heat treatment nor hot deformation, however recrystallization in the surface layers was not assessed. No disfavor of the fibrous grain structure associated with extruded materials was observed regarding workability at the relevant temperatures, thus extruded materials could be particularly suitable as base materials for press form hardening. The AA 7021. 50 extruded material appeared especially <b>suitable</b> for <b>press</b> form hardening due to a particularly high workability and low flow stress at the relevant forming conditions. The superior resistance to recrystallization in this material further favored it as a suitable base material for press form hardening. No detrimental effect of the hot deformation on the artificial ageing response was observed in the AA 6082. 25 rolled material. This should however be further and more thoroughly assessed for all potential base materials...|$|R
40|$|Large forming presses require great {{amounts of}} {{construction}} metal materials. Nevertheless, eco-design principles {{in the field}} of forming presses have seldom been confronted in the scientific literature. In this paper, an optimization model is proposed, <b>suitable</b> for designing <b>press</b> frames which are optimal in terms of energy efficiency. First, a framework is proposed for modular and functional description of a machine tool is described, in order to identify the largest energy consuming modules and functions. Then, a simple analytical model of loads, stresses and deformations is proposed for pre-stressed structures. Then, the equations of the analytical models are used as the constraints of a numerical global optimization algorithm, aimed at minimizing the amount of energy stored into the press frame and the extra-energy due to deformation of the columns in the usage lifetime of the press. The results clearly show that, only if the press frame structure is monolithic, it is possible to obtain a solution which is truly optimal. This conclusion is robust with respect to potential noise or uncertainty issues, which in this case are mainly related to the coefficient of the objective functions. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{contribution}} {{deals with}} the preparation of small-diameter briquettes {{on the basis of}} desintegrated phyto-materials and the admixture of coal and coke. The phyto-materials are classified as a dry biomass that can be, on the one hand, the wastes from wood-working industry,(sawdust, chips, bark, etc.) or dried mass from the plant production and, on the other hand, the mass of quick-growing plants cultivated on special plantations. In present time this renewable energy resource attracts attention by its heating value ranging from 10 to 16 MJ. kg- 1 (EkoWATT, 2001), a low ash content of 0. 5  6. 5 % and by a low sulphur content in a water free sample of 0. 05  0. 12 %. As a phyto-material the spruce sawdusts having a grain size of  2 mm were used. The admixture of brown coal, hard coal and coke with a grain size of 0. 040 mm was added to the sawdust and in such way prepared mixtures were subjected to briquetting with the aim to obtain small-diameter briquettes. The influence of admixtures amount on the density, and the <b>suitable</b> briquetting <b>press</b> have been studied. A saleability of briquettes on the basis of phyto-materials is conditioned by their density that must be higher than 1, 000 kg. m- 3. Thus, an adding of denser material with a relatively high calorific value would enable to attain the required density as well as to retain and/or to improve the main utility properties, i. e. calorific value and ash content. The adding evinces itself in an enhancement of briquetting press, but also density of obtained briquettes is often much higher that required by the market. It was showed {{that in the case of}} clear spruce sawdust the density of 1, 059 kg. m- 3 under the briquetting press of 250 MPa can be attained. According to other results, an admixture of brown coal is not very favourable because briquetting press exceeds the value of 300 MPa. As to hard coal adding, the presses under 250 MPa were achieved at the content of 25  30 %. The density of these briquettes ranges from 1, 050  1, 085 kg. m- 3. The best results have been obtained by adding coke. The briquetting press lower than 250 MPa has already been attained at the coke content of 15 %. The further increase of the coke content up to 30 % resulted in the briquetting press of 185 MPa. The density of briquettes with the admixture of coke was from 1, 037 to 1, 063 kg. m- 3...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates {{factors which}} the author {{believes}} could contribute to {{the determination of the}} aesthetic and economic viability of producing original fine art prints and artists books on a rotary offset press using direct imaged, uncoated lithographic plates. It also introduces a new medium for the creation and production of these works which was developed during this study. This investigation has been accomplished in the following ways: First, answers were sought to ten questions the author believed any artist considering the use of a rotary offset press as a means of producing these works would want to know. The answers were obtained through direct experimentation with a variety of plates which were processed by different procedures and then printed on a rotary offset press. The author concludes {{on the basis of this}} experimentation that when the artist 2 ̆ 7 s intentions for a specific work coincide with the capabilities of this production process as described in the answers, then this process can be considered aesthetically viable. Second, five-hundred copies of a sixteen page artists book were produced by the author to determine the aesthetic and economic viability of this production process for a specific work. The results indicated that a substantial saving in labor, time, and expense was obtained when this process was employed. There were also substantial savings to the integrity of the work. The author concludes that this process is aesthetically and economically viable for the production of this type of artists book. Third, a survey of commercial printers was undertaken to determine the aesthetic and economic viability of this process in cases where the artist does not have access to a <b>suitable</b> offset <b>press.</b> All the people interviewed indicated that their firms would be willing to accept for production plates imaged and processed by the artists. They also indicated that they would be willing to meet the artist 2 ̆ 7 s specifications for the work when these were obtainable, and that the total cost would be based principally on the hourly rate for the specific press being used. On the basis of these and other results of this survey, the author concludes that the production of original fine art prints and artists books by commercial lithographers can be aesthetically and economically viable for the production of certain works. Fourth, people professionally involved in the creation, printing, publishing, selling and collecting of these works were surveyed to assess their usage, awareness, and attitudes regarding their offset press production. The response data to one question in the survey allowed calculations to be made of the acceptability of this process to the total population of the types of people surveyed. As a result of these calculations, conclusions were made that seventy-six percent believe this process is acceptable for the production of original fine art prints. Similarly, one-hundred percent believe it is acceptable for the production of artists books. And fifth, the origins, principles, processing procedures, advantages, and disadvantages of a new medium for the creation and production of original prints and artists books are presented. This medium utilizes direct imaging techniques and light sensitive coated lithographic plates. It is presented for the first time in this study. Any artist wishing to learn about this new medium and any artist considering rotary offset production of original fine art prints or artists books, will find much useful in formation in this study. A portfolio of thirty prints accompanies this study to provide the reader with a firsthand view of the results of the experimentation...|$|R
