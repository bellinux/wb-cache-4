40|$|To {{increase}} {{real estate}} values, developers often apply designs on the land. In {{the case of}} a <b>single</b> <b>family</b> <b>housing</b> development, the designs are applied to the unit of subdivisions. In this study, the designs are defined as ?value creation concepts,? which increase housing values at the subdivision level. The value creation concepts are classified into five categories ? the sense of arrival, product mix, walkability, circulation system, and amenity. This cross-sectional study focuses on exploring the effects of value creation concepts in the subdivision. Two methodologies ? the Hedonic Price Model (HPM) and the Hierarchical Linear Model (HLM) ? are used to test whether or not the value creation concepts would increase or decrease <b>single</b> <b>family</b> <b>housing</b> values. The study sample is composed of 6, 562 <b>single</b> <b>family</b> <b>houses</b> nested in 85 subdivisions in College Station, Texas. Data are composed of two levels: the housing level and the subdivision level. The scores of the sense of arrival were provided by sixtyone graduate students at Texas A&M University using photograph evaluations. Most structural variables were obtained from the Brazos County Appraisal District, and physical environmental variables were objectively measured using the Geographical Information System. In the both models, sense of arrival, greenway connectivity, sidewalk connectivity, and median length of cul-de-sac variables have positive effects on <b>single</b> <b>family</b> <b>housing</b> values while phased project, the number of accessible entrances, street density, <b>single</b> <b>family</b> density, and median length of block variables have negative effects on <b>single</b> <b>family</b> <b>housing</b> values. At the housing level, several structural variables (e. g. bathrooms, attached garage, porches, etc), attached to a golf course, sports facilities, network distance from the nearest elementary school, population density, and personal variables (i. e., tenure, workable age, employment) were significant (p<. 05) predictors of <b>single</b> <b>family</b> <b>housing</b> value. Findings support that the value creation concepts have effects on increasing housing values at the subdivision level, which would provide thoughtful insights for developers in residential areas. In addition, the HLM can be used as the complement of the HPM by controlling interaction terms between housing variables and subdivision variables, or among the subdivision variables themselves...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the construction of}} price indexes for condominiums and <b>single</b> <b>family</b> <b>houses</b> in Switzerland over the period 1985 to 2004 using the indirect method. We find, that the pooling of the data, i. e. direct indexes with fixed hedonic prices, are good models for average properties but can be biased for the indexation of non-average properties. Therefore indirect index construction using predictions for specific properties based on annual equations are recommended. Based on differentiation of forty regions it is shown, that indexes vary from region to region, but show a comparable general course between 1985 and 2004. In recent years prices for <b>single</b> <b>family</b> <b>houses</b> raised in the large urban areas and tourist resorts but, due to big land reserves, were stable ore even declined in smaller urban and semi-urban {{as well as in}} rural areas. Price paths for condominiums are generally comparable to those of <b>single</b> <b>family</b> <b>houses</b> with the big difference, that over the last thre...|$|R

40|$|On {{behalf of}} the Swedish Energy Agency, SP has {{investigated}} and recommended how one could form a platform for demonstration of <b>single</b> <b>family</b> <b>houses</b> as nearly zero energy houses. SP suggests that TMF, the national trade and employers’ association of the wood processing and furniture industry in Sweden, should administrate this platform. The reason being that members of TMF produce almost 80 % of all <b>single</b> <b>family</b> <b>houses</b> in Sweden. TMF also {{has the capacity to}} launch a demonstration platform in a reasonable short time. SP has also compiled a set on technical criteria regarding properties related to energy use that should be met by demonstration projects within the platform. One presumption has been that a house that meets the criteria in the south of Sweden also should meet the criteria in the north of Sweden. The reason being to promote an industrialized and cost effective building process. Another ambition has been not to disfavor smaller <b>single</b> <b>family</b> <b>houses.</b> The main criteria are on very energy efficient building envelopes and very efficient building services systems. The criteria are therefore more detailed than the current Swedish building regulations...|$|R

Owning shares that correspond to one apartment in a housing company is generally considered as much owning your own home as actually directly owning a (<b>single</b> <b>family)</b> <b>house.</b> However, shares are not considered as real estate but as personal property and the co-op can take the possession of the apartment for a term time and evict the tenant or owner because of disturbance or unpaid maintenance fees.|$|E
