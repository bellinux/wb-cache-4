Early in the project a first set of evaluation tasks was carried out to verify the intelligibility of the diphone voice which serves as the default voice for external opendomain applications. The tests confirmed that the diphone voice produced <b>satisfactory</b> <b>intelligibility.</b> The speech corpus for the unit selection voice recorded by the same speaker is tailored to the typical, more restricted, SmartKom domains. Evaluation tasks focusing on typical SmartKom scenarios demonstrated the superiority of the unit selection voice. In tasks involving open-domain material, however, intelligibility of the unit selection voice appears to be less consistent than that of the diphone voice. In an audio-visual assessment task involving SmartKom specific contexts, the unit selection voice was found to be very well accepted and judged to be satisfactorily intelligible. 1...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: Although {{radiotherapy}} {{is a well}} codified {{treatment for}} laryngeal carcinomas, the management of local recurrence after failed radiotherapy remains controversial. Total laryngectomy is the classical salvage surgical approach. Recent evidence showed that selected laryngeal recurrences may be successfully treated with partial laryngectomies with comparable survival rates, acceptable morbidity, tracheostomy closure, effective swallowing, and <b>satisfactory</b> voice <b>intelligibility.</b> RECENT FINDINGS: Recurrent laryngeal carcinoma after radiotherapy failure requires a comprehensive clinical, radiological and pathological restaging. Strict selection criteria are mandatory for the identification of radiotherapy failure cases amenable to conservative laryngeal surgery. Although larger series confirmation is necessary, conservative salvage surgery seems definitely promising. Salvage endolaryngeal laser surgery after irradiation failure allows in selected cases a mean local control rate of 65...|$|R
40|$|Mosques are worship places {{used for}} {{activities}} performed by Muslim e. g. prayer, speech and Quran recitations. All {{activities in the}} mosques are important acoustical interests for <b>satisfactory</b> speech <b>intelligibility</b> i. e. verbal communication. Unfortunately, recent architectural styles or restoration works were given very little attention about acoustical considerations. In this research, the acoustical performance of five selected traditional vernacular mosques in Malaysia, built between 1728 - 1830, have been investigated as a preliminary study. The acoustic parameters such as reverberation time (RT), clarity (C 50) and speech transmission index (ST!) were measured. Measurement {{of the influence of}} the operating facilities in the mosques on their acoustic quality was also carried out. The PC-based measuring system (dBBati 32) with sound level meter (OldB Solo Metravib) as analyzer was utilized. Data collected reveals initial findings that the operating facilities in the mosques resulting higher rating of noise criteria which is reducing the performance of speech intelligibility...|$|R
40|$|Background: Voice organ {{disorders}} {{among teachers}} {{are caused by}} excessive voice strain. One of the measures to reduce this strain is to decrease background noise when teaching. Increasing the acoustic absorption of the room is a technical measure for achieving this aim. The absorption level also improves speech intelligibility rated by the following parameters: room reverberation time and speech transmission index (STI). This article presents the effects of acoustic adaptation of classrooms {{on the quality of}} verbal communication, aimed at getting the speech intelligibility at the good or excellent level. Material and Methods: The article lists the criteria for evaluating classrooms in terms of the quality of verbal communication. The parameters were defined, using the measurement methods according to PN-EN ISO 3382 - 2 : 2010 and PN-EN 60268 - 16 : 2011. Acoustic adaptations were completed in two classrooms. Results: After completing acoustic adaptations the reverberation time for the frequency of 1 kHz was reduced: in room no. 1 from 1. 45 s to 0. 44 s and in room no. 2 from 1. 03 s to 0. 37 s (maximum 0. 65 s). At the same time, the speech transmission index increased: in room no. 1 from 0. 55 (<b>satisfactory</b> speech <b>intelligibility)</b> to 0. 75 (speech intelligibility close to excellent); in room no. 2 from 0. 63 (good speech intelligibility) to 0. 80 (excellent speech intelligibility). Therefore, it can be stated that prior to completing acoustic adaptations room no. 1 did not comply and room no. 2 barely complied with the criterion (speech transmission index of 0. 62). After completing acoustic adaptations both rooms meet the requirements. Med Pr 2013; 64 (2) : 207 – 21...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis covers a {{considerably}} varied multidisciplinary area which {{needs to be addressed}} to be able to achieve a text-to-speech synthesis system of high quality, in any language. This {{is the first time that}} such a system has been built for Maltese, and therefore, there was the additional problem of no computerised sources or corpora. However many problems and much of the system designs are common to all languages. This thesis focuses on two general problems. The first is that of automatic labelling of phonemic data, since this is crucial for the setting up of Maltese speech corpora, which in turn can be used to improve the system. A novel way of achieving such automatic segmentation was investigated. This uses a mixed parameter model with maximum likelihood training of the first derivative of the features across a set of phonetic class boundaries. It was found that this gives good results even for continuous speech provided that a phonemic labelling of the text is available. A second general problem is that of segment concatenation, since the end and beginning of subsequent diphones can have mismatches in amplitude, frequency, phase and spectral envelope. The use of-intermediate frames, build up from the last and first frames of two concatenated diphones, to achieve a smoother continuity was analysed. The analysis was done both in time and in frequency. The use of wavelet theory for the separation of the spectral envelope from the excitation was also investigated. The linguistic system modules have been built for this thesis. In particular a rule based grapheme to phoneme conversion system that is serial and not hierarchical was developed. The morphological analysis required the design of a system which allowed two dissimilar lexical structures, (semitic and romance) to be integrated into one overall morphological analyser. Appendices at the back are included with detailed rules of the linguistic modules developed. The present system, while giving <b>satisfactory</b> <b>intelligibility,</b> with capability of modifying duration, does not include as yet a prosodic module...|$|E
