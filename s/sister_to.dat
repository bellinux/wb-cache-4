5|$|The {{families}} of Mecoptera are well accepted by taxonomists but their relationships have been debated. In 1987, R. Willman treated the Mecoptera as a clade, containing the Boreidae as <b>sister</b> <b>to</b> the Meropeidae, but in 2002 M. F. Whiting declared the Mecoptera paraphyletic, with the Boreidae as <b>sister</b> <b>to</b> another order, the Siphonaptera (fleas).|$|E
5|$|All the {{families}} were formerly treated {{as part of}} a single order, Mecoptera. The relationships between {{the families}} are however a matter of debate. The cladogram, from Cracraft and Donoghue 2004, places the Nannochoristidae as a separate order, with the Boreidae, <b>sister</b> <b>to</b> the Siphonaptera, also as its own order. The Eomeropidae is suggested to be <b>sister</b> <b>to</b> the rest of the Mecoptera, with the position of the Bittacidae unclear. Of those other families, the Meropeidae is the most basal, and the relationships of the rest not completely clear.|$|E

5|$|The {{cladogram}} {{of external}} relationships, {{based on a}} 2008 DNA and protein analysis, shows the order as a clade, <b>sister</b> <b>to</b> the Lepidoptera, and more distantly related to the Diptera (true flies) and Mecoptera (scorpionflies).|$|E

5|$|The {{relationship}} of ctenophores {{to the rest}} of Metazoa is very important {{to our understanding of the}} early evolution of animals and the origin of multicellularity. It has been the focus of debate for many years. Ctenophores have been purported to be the sister lineage to the Bilateria, <b>sister</b> <b>to</b> the Cnidaria, <b>sister</b> <b>to</b> Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria, and <b>sister</b> <b>to</b> all other animals. A series of studies that looked at the presence and absence of members of gene families and signalling pathways (e.g., homeoboxes, nuclear receptors, the Wnt signaling pathway, and sodium channels) showed evidence congruent with the latter two scenarios, that ctenophores are either <b>sister</b> <b>to</b> Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria or <b>sister</b> <b>to</b> all other animal phyla. Several more recent studies comparing complete sequenced genomes of ctenophores with other sequenced animal genomes have also supported ctenophores as the sister lineage to all other animals. This position would suggest that neural and muscle cell types were either lost in major animal lineages (e.g., Porifera and Placozoa) or that they evolved independently in the ctenophore lineage. However, other researchers have argued that the placement of Ctenophora as <b>sister</b> <b>to</b> all other animals is a statistical anomaly caused by the high rate of evolution in ctenophore genomes, and that Porifera (sponges) is the earliest-diverging animal taxon instead. As such, the Ctenophora appear to be a basal diploblast clade. In agreement with the latter point, the analysis of a very large sequence alignment at the metazoan taxonomic scale (1,719 proteins totalizing ca. 400,000 amino acid positions) showed that ctenophores emerge as the second-earliest branching animal lineage, and sponges are sister-group to all other multicellular animals. Another study strongly rejects the hypothesis that sponges are the sister group to all other extant animals and establishes the placement of Ctenophora as the sister group to all other animals, and disagreement with the last-mentioned paper is explained by methodological problems in analyses in that work.|$|E

50|$|The {{taxonomy}} of the Cestoda has been clarified with molecular data.

The Caryophyllidea are the <b>sister</b> group <b>to</b> Spathebothriidea and remaining Eucestoda. The Haplobothriidea are the <b>sister</b> group <b>to</b> Diphyllobothriidae.

50|$|In {{the year}} 1834 Most Rev.

5|$|According to the IUCN, further taxonomic {{investigation}} {{is required to}} confirm the black dogfish in the North Atlantic and the southeastern Atlantic represent the same species.

5|$|Apatosaurus alenquerensis {{was named}} in 1957 by Albert-Félix de Lapparent and Georges Zbyweski. It {{was based on}} post cranial {{material}} from Portugal.
