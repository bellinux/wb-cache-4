5|$|O'Neill began researching high-energy {{particle}} physics at Princeton in 1954, after {{he received his}} doctorate from Cornell University. Two years later, he published his theory for a particle <b>storage</b> <b>ring.</b> This invention allowed particle accelerators at much higher energies than had previously been possible. In 1965 at Stanford University, he performed the first colliding beam physics experiment.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Cornell, O'Neill {{accepted}} {{a position as}} an instructor at Princeton University. There he started his research into high-energy particle physics. In 1956, his second year of teaching, he published a two-page article that theorized that the particles produced by a particle accelerator could be stored {{for a few seconds}} in a <b>storage</b> <b>ring.</b> The stored particles could then be directed to collide with another particle beam. This would increase the energy of the particle collision over the previous method, which directed the beam at a fixed target. His ideas were not immediately accepted by the physics community.|$|E
5|$|Gerard Kitchen O'Neill (February 6, 1927 – April 27, 1992) was an American {{physicist}} and space activist. As {{a faculty member}} of Princeton University, he invented a device called the particle <b>storage</b> <b>ring</b> for high-energy physics experiments. Later, he invented a magnetic launcher called the mass driver. In the 1970s, he developed a plan to build human settlements in outer space, including a space habitat design known as the O'Neill cylinder. He founded the Space Studies Institute, an organization devoted to funding research into space manufacturing and colonization.|$|E

A design concept is presented for proton <b>storage</b> <b>rings</b> which was developed {{at the beginning of}} the ISR study. The design and performance of proton- proton colliding-beam <b>storage</b> <b>rings</b> is restricted by two different kinds of limitation: those due to technology and funds, and those due to space-charge phenomena. The design aim is to achieve the best possible luminosity within all these constraints. A procedure is outlined which includes all constraints from the beginning. Sets of machine parameters obtained in this way are given for reference. (20 refs) ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Storage</b> <b>rings</b> {{are most}} often used to store {{electrons}} that radiate synchrotron radiation. Over 50 facilities based on electron <b>storage</b> <b>rings</b> exist and are used {{for a variety of}} studies in chemistry and biology. <b>Storage</b> <b>rings</b> {{can also be used to}} produce polarized high-energy electron beams through the Sokolov-Ternov effect. The best-known application of <b>storage</b> <b>rings</b> is their use in particle accelerators and in particle colliders, where two counter-rotating beams of stored particles are brought into collision at discrete locations. The resulting subatomic interactions are then studied in a surrounding particle detector. Examples of such facilities are LHC, LEP, PEP-II, KEKB, RHIC, Tevatron and HERA.|$|R
5|$|Synchrotrons are {{generally}} national facilities, each with several dedicated beamlines where data is collected without interruption. Synchrotrons were originally {{designed for use}} by high-energy physicists studying subatomic particles and cosmic phenomena. The largest component of each synchrotron is its electron <b>storage</b> <b>ring.</b> This ring is actually not a perfect circle, but a many-sided polygon. At each corner of the polygon, or sector, precisely aligned magnets bend the electron stream. As the electrons’ path is bent, they emit bursts {{of energy in the}} form of X-rays.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{initiated}} {{the construction of}} a 1.4 GeV synchrotron in 1952. As he had foreseen in 1948, it produced artificial K mesons and rho mesons, and tested quantum electrodynamics at short distances. The last machine he built at Cornell was a 12 GeV synchrotron that remains in use as an injector for the Cornell Electron <b>Storage</b> <b>Ring</b> (CESR), built between 1977 and 1999. It is located in what is now known as the Wilson Synchrotron Laboratory.|$|E
25|$|A <b>storage</b> <b>ring</b> {{is a type}} of {{circular}} {{particle accelerator}} in which a continuous or pulsed particle beam may be kept circulating {{for a long period of}} time, up to many hours. Gerard K. O'Neill invented the first particle <b>storage</b> <b>ring</b> in 1956.|$|E

25|$|The {{injection}} system {{consists of a}} 250 MeV LINAC, a low energy transfer line, a 2.9 GeV booster synchrotron and a high energy transfer line. The LINAC was operated for over 30 years {{as part of the}} Saskatchewan Accelerator Lab and operates at 2586MHz. The 78m low energy transfer line takes the electrons from the below-ground LINAC to the ground level booster in the newer CLS building, via two vertical chicanes. The full energy 2.9 GeV booster, chosen to give high orbit stability in the <b>storage</b> <b>ring,</b> operates at 1Hz, with an RF frequency of 500Hz, unsynchronised with the LINAC. This results in significant beam loss at the extraction energy.|$|E
25|$|In 1956, Jentschke {{became an}} ordinarius Professor of Physics at the University of Hamburg. There, {{he found a}} {{positive}} climate, as well as funding, for his vision of building a new institute around a particle accelerator. An international particle accelerator conference at CERN in 1956 was helpful in the decision of which accelerator to build. His vision could not be supported by Hamburg alone, so negotiations took place to bring {{in support of the}} Federal Republic of Germany and the states of Germany (Länder). A financial agreement was signed on 18 December 1959, which founded the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY), a 7.5 GeV electron synchrotron. Jentschke was chairman of the DESY Board of Directors from 1959 to 1970, and for many years also the director of the Second Institute of Experimental Physics at the University of Hamburg. While at DESY, Jentschke endorsed the electron-positron <b>storage</b> <b>ring</b> scheme for the DORIS accelerator, and promoted the use of synchrotron radiation for research purposes.|$|E
25|$|Cornell {{scientists}} have researched the fundamental particles of nature {{for more than}} 70 years. Cornell physicists, such as Hans Bethe, contributed {{not only to the}} foundations of nuclear physics but also participated in the Manhattan Project (see also: List of Cornell Manhattan Project people). In the 1930s, Cornell built the second cyclotron in the United States. In the 1950s, Cornell physicists became the first to study synchrotron radiation. During the 1990s, the Cornell Electron <b>Storage</b> <b>Ring,</b> located beneath Alumni Field, was the world's highest-luminosity electron-positron collider. After building the synchrotron at Cornell, Robert R. Wilson took a leave of absence to become the founding director of Fermilab, which involved designing and building the largest accelerator in the United States. Cornell's accelerator and high-energy physics groups are involved {{in the design of the}} proposed International Linear Collider and plan to participate in its construction and operation. The International Linear Collider, to be completed in the late 2010s, will complement the Large Hadron Collider and shed light on questions such as the identity of dark matter and the existence of extra dimensions.|$|E

Design of subsystems focussed on the proposed German in kind contributions, i. e. stochastic cooling systems for CR and RESR, rf systems for the CR and all the subsystems and interfaces which are common to all accelerators of FAIR. The latest status of the ring design was communicated to the civil construction division and to the external companies which are working on all civil construction issues.

500|$|Wilson and McDaniel {{continued}} to collaborate at Cornell until Wilson left to head Fermilab in Batavia, Illinois in 1967. In 1972, Wilson invited McDaniel {{to serve as}} acting head of the accelerator section at Fermilab, and McDanield took a one-year {{leave of absence from}} Cornell. Though the Fermilab accelerator had been placed into operation, it suffered from frequent component failures. When McDaniel left eight months later, he led the effort which increased the power of Fermilab's accelerator from 20 GeV to 300 GeV and its beam density by a factor of 1000. Of McDaniel's contribution to Fermilab, Wilson said, [...] "This bravura performance demonstrated Mac’s skill for leadership as well as his celebrated sixth sense for finding sources of trouble and fixing them.” Upon returning to Cornell in 1974, McDaniel proposed upgrading the then existing 10 GeV synchrotron with an 8 GeV electron-positron <b>storage</b> <b>ring,</b> which would greatly increase the energy of particle collisions when the particles in the <b>storage</b> <b>ring</b> hit the particles traveling in the opposite direction in the synchrotron. [...] When constructed in 1979, the Cornell Electron <b>Storage</b> <b>Ring</b> became the world's primary source of information about one of the fundamental building blocks of matter, the b-quark. [...] After the end of particle physics experiments 20 years later, CESR is now used as a test facility of damping rings for a future international linear collider. In 1981, McDaniel developed a proposal for a new mile-diameter electron-positron collider called CSER II, but could not obtain the necessary $200 million in funding for it. In 1988, McDaniel was Visiting Distinguished Professor at Arizona State University.|$|E

[...] The superconducting nature of the niobium cavity means only 0.02% of the RF power put into the cavity is wasted in heating the cavity as compared to roughly 40% for normal-conducting (copper) cavities. [...] However, a large portion of this power saving - about 160kW out of the 250kW saved - is needed to power the cryogenic plant required to supply liquid helium to the cavity.
