Detergents {{may be used}} in any form (liquid, powder, paste, bar, cake, shape, etc,) widely for household laundry products, domestic and industrial cleaners, cosmetic products, and industrial purposes. Surfactants are organic substances, used in detergents, intentionally added to achieve cleaning, rising and/or fabric softening due to its surface-active properties. They consist of one or more hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups of such nature and size that they are capable of forming micelles. Surfactants belong to a group of chemicals of high environment relevance due to their large production volumes. They are mainly discharged into the environment by the wastewater pathway, either after treatment in a wastewater treatment plant or directly where no treatment is available. Environmental compartments, which may be influenced by surfactants, are the fresh water environment (water body and sediments), the soil if surfactants loaded sewage sludge is added, and the marine environment. The wastewaters of detergent manufacturing contain high levels of inhibitory surfactants that pose appreciable impacts on the environment. In addition to industrial wastewaters, domestic wastewater also includes synthetic organic compounds like surfactants, personal-care products, additives that have severe effects on wildlife and human health due to their toxicological properties. Therefore there is a growing research need on the inhibitory effects and removal of such compounds. Linear alkyl benzene sulphonates (LAS) and <b>sodium</b> <b>lauryl</b> ether <b>sulphate</b> (SLES) {{play an important role in}} our everyday, since they have been announced as biodegradable and environmentally friendly surfactants compared to branched benzene sulphonates like Dodecyl Benzene Sulphonates. LAS are known as biodegradable due to the linear structure of the alkyl benzene group present in this molecular structure. However, it has also been reported that surfactants, specifically linear alkyl benzene sulphonates decrease the affinity of substrate to biomass and lower maximum growth rates are observed in the presence of surfactants. <b>Sodium</b> <b>lauryl</b> ether <b>sulphate</b> consists of straight carbon chains, usually 12 to 14, and, due to its more simple structure (i. e., no benzene ring), it can be more easily biodegradable than other surfactants such as LAS. Biodegradation is an important factor for reduction and removal of organic contaminants from the environment. The evaluation of biodegradability of anthropogenic organic substances is an essential parameter for environmental risk assessment and required according to appropriate legislation. In a risk assessment study it has been pointed out that the risk imposed on the aquatic by the anionic surfactants depends upon the applied treatment scheme prior to discharge of wastewater. [...] RESUMO O presente trabalho foi desenvolvido numa indústria de produtos de limpeza doméstica (LD) e higiene pessoal (HP), onde está implementada uma estação de tratamento de águas residuais industriais (ETARI). Durante o estudo foi monitorizada e avaliada a biodegradabilidade de algumas substâncias base dos detergentes (tensoactivos aniónicos), nomeadamente o LAS e o SLES, bem como o efluente da indústria nas diferentes fases de tratamento implementado na ETARI. Ao longo do processo de tratamento dos fluxos que compõem as águas residuais industriais, procurou-se estabelecer relações entre parâmetros chave de avaliação do conteúdo em matéria orgânica (Carência Química Oxigénio – CQO e Carência Bioquímica Oxigénio – CBO) com os tensoactivos anteriormente referidos.

40|$|Studies with lambs held in pens {{have shown}} that the rate of wool growth is {{increased}} when protozoa are absent from the rumen (Bird et al., 1979; Bird and Leng, 1983). Wool growth was stimulated over a wide range of protein intakes indicating the potential for increasing the production of sheep grazing pasture. Following a study with lambs in pens (Bird and Leng, 1983) two groups of 20 lambs (faunated and defaunated) were allowed to graze green oat pasture with an understudy of ryegrass, clover and lucerne. The paddock was divided into four blocks (1 ha) and grazed in a 4 x 21 d rotation. Over 84 d defaunated lambs had a higher rate of body weight gain (23 %) and wool growth rate (19 %) (measured over the last 63 days) with respect to the faunated lambs. In a second experiment the productivity of pregnant ewes (faunated and defaunated) grazing native pasture was monitored over a 23 week period (first lambs were born in the eleventh week). Following joining, ewes were held in a shed and drenched with alkanate 3 SL 3 (anionic detergent, <b>sodium</b> <b>lauryl</b> diethoxy <b>sulphate</b> I. C. I. Aust. Ltd.) to remove protozoa. Animals were randomised into two groups of 32 and one group was reinoculated with rumen fluid containing protozoa before being returned to pasture. The sheep were apparently free of rumen protozoa until the tenth week when small numbers of protozoa were detected in rumen fluid samples collected from 6 of the defaunated ewes, 6 weeks later almost all ewes in the defaunated group were contaminated with protozoa.
