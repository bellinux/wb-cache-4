40|$|<b>Southern</b> <b>flounder</b> (Parlichthys lethostigma) is a recreationally and commercially {{important}} flatfish species {{found in}} the Gulf of Mexico, and recent analyses indicate that the northern Gulf of Mexico population is in decline. For proper management, knowledge of habitats used throughout the juvenile stage is needed. The aim {{of the current study}} is to examine habitat use of young-of-year (YOY) <b>southern</b> <b>flounder</b> in the Galveston Bay complex using habitat distribution models and acoustic telemetry. A set of habitat distribution models examined how habitat use changes {{during the first year of}} life. In addition, <b>southern</b> <b>flounder</b> were tagged with acoustic telemetry transmitters and monitored with a novel receiver array that allows for measurements of fine-scale movements. These movements were compared to habitat maps to examine habitat selection. Habitat distribution models determined that habitat requirements for <b>southern</b> <b>flounder</b> change with ontogeny and season. Newly settled <b>southern</b> <b>flounder</b> were most influenced by physicochemical parameters and the presence of seagrass beds. YOY <b>southern</b> <b>flounder,</b> however, showed increased occurrence at freshwater inlets during summer and fall months, and occurrence decreased at tidal inlets during the fall. Predictions of habitat suitability across the Galveston Bay complex indicate that the factors influencing occurrence of <b>southern</b> <b>flounder</b> change with season, ontogeny, and availability of suitable habitats. With acoustic telemetry, it was apparent that habitat use by <b>southern</b> <b>flounder</b> was nonrandom and influenced by benthic and other physicochemical conditions. Habitat analyses indicated that <b>southern</b> <b>flounder</b> used sand habitats more frequently than seagrass, oyster reef, or salt marsh habitats. Telemetry results also indicated that depth and water temperature were important determinants of habitat suitability for YOY <b>southern</b> <b>flounder,</b> with individuals preferring deeper and cooler regions of the water column in Christmas Bay.

40|$|Several {{flatfish}} species including <b>southern</b> <b>flounder</b> (Paralichthys lethostigma) recruit to estuaries {{during early}} life. Therefore, {{the evaluation of}} estuarine sites and habitats that serve as nurseries is critical to conservation and management efforts. I used biochemical condition and growth measurements in conjunction with catch-density data to evaluate settlement sites used by <b>southern</b> <b>flounder</b> in the Galveston Bay Estuary (GBE). In 2005, beam-trawl collections were made in three major sections of the GBE (East Bay, West Bay, Galveston Bay), and three sites were sampled in each bay. Within each sampling site, replicate collections were taken from 1) the marsh edge, 2) an intermediate zone, and 3) the open bay. The average size of <b>southern</b> <b>flounder</b> collected was between 12 and 19 mm standard length, and peak densities occurred in January and February. Catch data indicated that numeric densities of <b>southern</b> <b>flounder</b> were significantly greater in East Bay (2. 75 per 100 m 2) than in West Bay (0. 45 per 100 m 2) or in Galveston Bay (0. 91 per 100 m 2). Habitat-specific variation in density was not found. Otolith-based estimates of age indicated {{that the majority of}} <b>southern</b> <b>flounder</b> collected were 35 - 45 days old and derived from early December to early January hatch-dates. Growth rate differences were negligible across bays and habitats, with the average growth rate being 0. 40 mm/day (range 0. 21 - 0. 76 mm/day). RNA:DNA ratios indicated that newly settled <b>southern</b> <b>flounder</b> in the GBE were in relatively high condition. Habitat-specific differences in RNA:DNA ratios were not observed; however, ratios were significantly lower in West Bay (average 8. 0) than in East Bay (average 9. 5) or in Galveston Bay (average 9. 8), suggesting the condition of new recruits may vary across the GBE. Findings from this study indicate that <b>southern</b> <b>flounder</b> use a variety of habitats within the GBE during early life, and survival and recruitment success appear favorable regardless of settlement site. As a result, recruitment success of <b>southern</b> <b>flounder</b> may be less a function of the quality of nursery sites/habitats within the GBE than of other factors (e. g., larval supply to the estuary) ...|$|E
40|$|Bycatch of {{protected}} species in commercial fishing operations {{is a primary}} concern to fishery managers because it threatens the conservation, protection, and recovery of fragile species, such as the Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus). One potential solution {{to reduce the risk}} associated with commercial fishing operations is to design commercial fishing gear that is more selective in terms of interactions between Atlantic sturgeon and commercial fisheries. Given this conservation and management need, the overarching goal was to reduce Atlantic sturgeon fishery interactions and maintain <b>southern</b> <b>flounder</b> (Paralichthys lethostigma) catch in North Carolina. The specific objectives of this study were to design and evaluate the effectiveness of a modified gillnet. Overall, the results proved that lowering the profile and amount of webbing had a beneficial impact at reducing Atlantic sturgeon incidental encounters and bycatch. The modified gillnet reduced bycatch and Atlantic sturgeon encounters by 39. 6 % and 60. 9 %, respectively. Our design entangled 51. 6 % fewer <b>southern</b> <b>flounder,</b> which corresponded to a 48. 9 % reduction in total weight; the modified gear entangled slightly larger <b>southern</b> <b>flounder</b> than the control gear.

40|$|Abstract. —Estimation of harvest {{rates is}} often a {{critical}} component of fishery stock assessment and management. These assessments are often based on catch-at-age data sets generated over many years, but estimates of instantaneous fishing mortality (F) can also be obtained from a shorter-term tag return study. We conducted a 2 -year tag return experiment to generate direct estimates of F for <b>southern</b> <b>flounder</b> Paralichthys lethostigma in a North Carolina estuary. The <b>southern</b> <b>flounder</b> supports lucrative commercial and recreational fisheries within the state and has experienced heavy fishing pressure for more than a decade. During 2005 and 2006, fish were captured and tagged with the assistance of commercial harvesters in the New River estuary. Tag returns were used to generate monthly estimates of F, which demonstrated a clear seasonal pattern that was consistent between years. Several important assumptions of the tag return model were accounted for through the use of double-tagged individuals, the distribution of both high- and standard-reward tags, and the completion of an independent controlled experiment to evaluate mortality related to tagging. Annual estimates of F exceeded the short-term management target in both years. Residual patterns suggest that the estimates may actually have been biased low, possibly due to delayed mixing of tagged fish. Thus, despite recently amended fishery regulations, F in the North Carolina <b>southern</b> <b>flounder</b> gill-net fishery still has the potential to greatly exceed targeted levels, which may delay stock recovery.

Six species were included in the analysis based on their ecological and economic importance and relative abundance in available surveys: spot Leiostomus xanthurus, pinfish Lagodon rhomboides, <b>southern</b> <b>flounder</b> Paralichthys lethostigma, summer flounder Paralichthys dentatus, Atlantic croaker Micropogonias undulatus, and Atlantic menhaden Brevoortia tyrannus. Cross-correlation analysis was used to examine {{the relationships between the}} larval and juvenile abundances within species. Tests of synchrony across species were used to find similarities in recruitment dynamics for species with similar winter shelf-spawning life-history strategies. Positive correlations were found between the larval and juvenile abundances for three of the six selected species (spot, pinfish, and <b>southern</b> <b>flounder).</b> These three species have similar geographic ranges that primarily lie south of Cape Hatteras. There were no significant correlations between the larval and juvenile abundances for the other three species (summer flounder, Atlantic croaker, and Atlantic menhaden); we suggest several factors that could account for the lack of a relationship. Synchrony was found among the three southern species within both the larval and juvenile abundance time series. These results provide support for using larval ingress measures as indices of abundance for these and other species with similar geographic ranges and winter shelf-spawning life-history strategies...|$|E
40|$|Progestin hormones stimulate sperm {{motility}} in teleosts but their mechanisms of action remain unclear. Preliminary {{results suggest that}} progestin upregulation of {{sperm motility}} in <b>southern</b> <b>flounder</b> and several other marine species is mediated through a sperm membrane progestin receptor with the characteristics of membrane progestin receptor alpha (mPRα, also known as Paqr 7 b). The hypothesis that mPRα has {{an important role in}} progestin regulation of <b>southern</b> <b>flounder</b> sperm motility and fertility was tested in the present study. The specific mPRα agonist, 10 -ethenyl- 19 -norprogesterone (Org OD 02 - 0, 100 nM), mimicked the stimulatory actions of the endogenous progestin, 17, 20 β, 21 -trihydroxy- 4 -pregnen- 3 -one (20 β-S, 100 nM) on flounder sperm motility. The concentration of the mPRα protein on sperm plasma membranes was positively correlated to sperm motility as well as the responsiveness of sperm to progestin stimulation. Acute in vitro progestin treatment of sperm with high mPRα protein levels increased both sperm motility and fertilization success in strip spawning experiments. However, in vitro progestin treatments were ineffective on sperm with low receptor abundance. A single injection of the superactive gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog (LHRHa, 100 μg/kg) increased sperm motility and fertilization success in strip spawning experiments 72 h post-injection which was accompanied by an increase in mPRα protein concentrations on sperm plasma membranes. These results provide clear evidence that <b>southern</b> <b>flounder</b> sperm hypermotility is mediated through mPRα. Stimulatory G proteins, but not inhibitory G proteins, were identified in flounder sperm plasma membrane fractions. The finding that treatment of flounder sperm plasma membrane fractions with either 20 β-S or Org OD 02 - 0 increases cAMP levels suggests progestins stimulate flounder sperm motility by activating an mPRα/stimulatory G protein/membrane adenylyl cyclase pathway. A similar mechanism has been identified in Atlantic croaker, suggesting that the signaling pathway mediated by mPRα in sperm is highly conserved in advanced teleosts. Collectively, our results indicate that progestin-stimulation of flounder sperm hypermotility and fertility is dependent on a sufficient concentration of mPRα which can be upregulated by in vivo LHRHa treatments. These findings potentially have practical applications for enhancing the fertility of male flounder broodstock...|$|E
