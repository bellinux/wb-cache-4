5|$|Treatments are varied {{because there}} are {{multiple}} perspectives of alcoholism. Those who approach alcoholism as a medical condition or disease recommend differing treatments from, for instance, those who approach the condition as one of social choice. Most treatments focus on helping people discontinue their alcohol intake, followed up with life training and/or <b>social</b> <b>support</b> to help them resist a return to alcohol use. Since alcoholism involves multiple factors which encourage a person to continue drinking, they must all be addressed to successfully prevent a relapse. An example {{of this kind of}} treatment is detoxification followed by a combination of supportive therapy, attendance at self-help groups, and ongoing development of coping mechanisms. The treatment community for alcoholism typically supports an abstinence-based zero tolerance approach; however, some prefer a harm-reduction approach.|$|E

Youth in higher grade levels were more likely to describe their future plans, activities that pursued those plans, and reasons that con-sidered consequences to others as well as themselves.

40|$|<b>Social</b> welfare <b>support</b> runs in families. Recent {{studies using}} Nordic {{registry}} data have found {{individual differences in}} genetic factors to be of substantial importance for medical benefits. However, to date {{there has been no}} genetically informative studies on receiving <b>social</b> welfare <b>support.</b> To prevent young adults to not drop out of the work life and become recipients of <b>social</b> welfare <b>support,</b> it is of substantial interest to clarify to what extent the familiarity of <b>social</b> welfare <b>support</b> is due to genetic or social differences between families. We used data from the Historical-Event Database on 7, 698 Norwegian twins born 1967 - 1979 to estimate the relative contribution of genetic factors, the effective familial environment (i. e. the “shared environment”), and individual-specific environmental factors. We found that the two forms of familial risk, genetic and shared environmental, explained 39 % and 45 %, respectively, of the risk for receiving <b>social</b> welfare <b>support</b> among young Norwegian twins. Only 17 % of the variance in risk factors could be explained by individual-specific risk factors. It appears that risk for receiving <b>social</b> welfare <b>support</b> can to a great extent be explained by environmental differences between families. Therefore prevention strategies targeting social inequalities between families would indeed be effective. Furthermore, genetic risk factors are also important in explaining risk for receiving <b>social</b> welfare <b>support.</b> These effects could be mediated through heritable traits related to substance abuse, psychiatric disorders, and personality. Individual-specific risk factors were of very little importance. Hence, with regard to receiving <b>social</b> welfare <b>support,</b> family matters...|$|R

Māori undergraduate students, who had successfully appealed from 2003 - 2012, were recruited for my research. The availability and utilisation of <b>social</b> <b>supports</b> were investigated, along with the decision to make an appeal, the role of cultural expectations, and barriers experienced by participants. A mixed method approach was utilised in this research through use of an adapted overarching Kaupapa Māori framework, statistical analysis, and 13 interviews. My research found that <b>social</b> <b>supports</b> were beneficial for participants throughout their appeal, as they provided: emotional, instrumental, appraisal, and informational <b>support.</b> Although the <b>social</b> <b>supports</b> utilised by participants were satisfactory, barriers to accessing formal supports were also found, which included: perceived stigma having failed their papers, pride, as well as being whakamā. The appeal process was a beneficial intervention from the University of Waikato, which provided participants another opportunity to overcome the factors that contributed to their initial failure. Post appeal, participants implemented strategies to address and reduce their factors in order to become academically engaged.
