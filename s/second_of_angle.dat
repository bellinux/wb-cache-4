5000|$|For angles {{from around}} 5.7 up to 90 degrees, sines are found by {{comparing}} the S scale with C (or D) scale; though on many closed-body rules the S scale relates to the A scale instead, and what follows must be adjusted appropriately. The S scale has a <b>second</b> set <b>of</b> <b>angles</b> (sometimes in a different color), which run in the opposite direction, and are used for cosines. Tangents are found {{by comparing the}} T scale with the C (or D) scale for angles less than 45 degrees. For angles greater than 45 degrees the CI scale is used. Common forms such as [...] can be read directly from x on the S scale to the result on the D scale, when the C-scale index is set at k. For angles below 5.7 degrees, sines, tangents, and radians are approximately equal, and are found on the ST or SRT (sines, radians, and tangents) scale, or simply divided by 57.3 degrees/radian. Inverse trigonometric functions are found by reversing the process.|$|R

The exact medium transmission line model in power system consists of the series resistance series reactance and shunt capacitance. It is not easy task to obtain the mathematical model of the SVC with the exact medium transmission line model for investigating transient stability performance. Approach: This study applied {{the concept of the}} two-port network to simplify the mathematical model of the power system. The full capacity of the SVC on transient stability improvement of the SMIB with the medium transmission line was then investigated. The proposed method was tested on sample system and compared on various cases. Results: The first swing <b>of</b> rotor <b>angle</b> curve <b>of</b> the faulted system without resistance was obviously higher than that of with resistance whereas the <b>second</b> swing <b>of</b> the faulted system without resistance was slightly less than that of with resistance.

40|$|Anisotropic Magnetoresistance (AMR) sensors are {{magnetic}} sensors {{often used}} for angle measurements. The sensor outputs should be two perfect sinusoidal signals that depend on the angle to be measured. However due to non-ideal properties of the sensor, the actual outputs include undesired parameters as offset voltage, amplitude imbalance and harmonics. All of them generate errors in the angle calculation. Offset voltage and amplitude imbalance are the first and <b>second</b> largest sources <b>of</b> <b>angle</b> errors for which until now are the mainly compensated. The required compensation factors are usually estimated {{at the start of}} the sensor life and not updated during its lifetime. Although the sources <b>of</b> <b>angle</b> errors show variations due to wearing and aging effects, so far it is considered that these variations are not significant to affect the sensor accuracy. However, this will change in the future, especially in safety-critical applications that will demand higher accuracy. Then it will be necessary to update the compensation factors during the sensor lifetime. This paper proposes an online compensation method to reduce the offset voltage, the amplitude imbalance and hence the angle error in AMR sensors. It was verified using simulated data as well as real measurements, showing a good performance in all the cases. Unlike most of the compensation methods proposed until now, our method is suitable to be used during the sensor lifetime...|$|R

This set of calculations simulates erosion of flocs from a sand bed. Results show that critical erosion shear stress varies only weakly with diameter for typical flocs during erosion of a fluff layer, and that fine particles are protected from erosion in sand beds while large low-density flocs are easily resuspended.

40|$|Two new {{guidance}} {{laws for}} short range homing missiles are developed by invoking the {{sliding mode control}} (SMC) theory. Guidance law 1 as structured around the basic proportional navigation (PN), with an additive switching term, which {{is a function of}} the line of sight (LOS) rate alone. An adaptive procedure is suggested to select the gain of the switching term, in order to reduce chattering. This guidance law is nearly as simple to implement as the PN itself and does not require any explicit target maneuver estimation. Guidance law 2, based on a first order sliding surface, is designed such that it results in a continuous acceleration law, thereby reducing the chattering problem. While explicitly taking into account the effect of aerodynamic drag, it requires the <b>second</b> derivatives <b>of</b> LOS <b>angle</b> and range, which are not directly measured. An estimation scheme, again based on sliding mode theory, is presented to estimate these quantities. Simulation results clearly demonstrate the superior performance of these scheme...|$|R

40|$|We {{have used}} atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM) to study the conformation of three-way DNA junctions, intermediates of DNA replication and recombination. Immobile three-way junctions with one hairpin arm (50, 27, 18 and 7 bp long) and two relatively long linear arms were obtained by annealing two partially homologous restriction fragments. Fragments containing inverted repeats of specific length formed hairpins after denaturation. Three-way junctions were obtained by annealing one strand of a fragment from a parental plasmid with one strand of an inverted repeat-containing fragment, purified from gels, and examined by AFM. The molecules are clearly seen as three-armed molecules with one short arm and two flexible long arms. The AFM analysis revealed two important features of three-way DNA junctions. First, three-way junctions are very dynamic structures. This conclusion {{is supported by a}} high variability <b>of</b> the inter-arm <b>angle</b> detected on dried samples.

The Static Var Compensator (SVC) has been proposed for the better control power flow and dynamic performance. The exact long transmission line model consists of the resistance and reactance. Most of previous researches studies transient stability performance of the SVC in SMIB System with neglecting resistance of the line. Thus the fully capability of the SVC on transient stability improvement of power system may not be applied. The consideration of the resistance causes in the difficulty of deriving mathematical model. Approach: This study investigates {{the effect of the}} SVC on transient stability of the power system with consideration the exact long transmission line mode. The concept of two-port network is applied to simplify the mathematical model of the power system. The proposed method is tested on sample system and compared on various cases.
