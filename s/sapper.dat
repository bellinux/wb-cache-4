5|$|German {{geographer}} Karl <b>Sapper</b> {{visited the}} ruins in 1896 and published {{a brief description}} of the ruins together with a site map two years later in a 6-page pamphlet by the Internationales Archiv für Ethnographie of Leyden in the Netherlands, entitled Die Ruinen von Mixco, Guatemala. It was <b>Sapper</b> who labelled each of the archaeological groups and their attendant structures. American archaeologist A. Ledyard Smith visited the ruins in 1949 and wrote a chapter about the site in his Archaeological Reconnaissance in Central America, published by the Carnegie Institution of Washington in 1955. Archeological excavations were carried out from 1954 through 1967 by the Musée de l'Homme of Paris under the direction of archaeologist Henri Lehmann, who certainly believed that he was excavating the Pocomam capital as described in Colonial records.|$|E
5|$|Each {{regiment}} and corps has distinctive insignia, {{such as a}} cap badge, beret, tactical recognition flash or stable belt. Many units {{also call}} soldiers of different ranks by different names; a NATO OR-1 (private) is called a guardsman in Guards regiments, a gunner in artillery units and a <b>sapper</b> in engineer units. These names do not affect a soldier's pay or role.|$|E
5|$|The first {{published}} account appeared in 1888, written by Gustav Bruhl. The German ethnologist and naturalist Karl <b>Sapper</b> described Stela1 in 1894 after {{he saw it}} beside the road he was travelling. Max Vollmberg, a German artist, drew Stela 1 and noted some other monuments, which attracted the interest of Walter Lehmann.|$|E
25|$|In 1847 the Bengal <b>Sappers</b> and Miners {{was renamed}} Bengal <b>Sappers</b> and Pioneers, and in 1851 {{it became the}} Corps of Bengal <b>Sappers</b> and Miners. On 7November 1853, the {{regiment}} moved to Roorkee, where it has maintained its regimental centre ever since. Lord Kitchener's reforms in 1903 saw it redesignated as the 1st <b>Sappers</b> and Miners, which was again altered in 1906 to the 1st Prince of Wales's Own <b>Sappers</b> and Miners.|$|R
50|$|Since {{this group}} was {{constituted}} by the Madras Presidency, and formed part of the Madras Army, they were called the Madras <b>Sappers.</b> Likewise in 1803 and again in 1824, the Bengal <b>Sappers</b> and Bombay <b>Sappers</b> were formed in the other presidencies.|$|R
25|$|The Indian Army Corps of Engineers {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} arms of the Indian Army, dating back to 1780, when the two regular pioneer {{companies}} of the Madras <b>Sappers</b> were raised, as a part of British East India Company army. Prior to its formation, by 1740s British officers and engineers served in the Bengal Engineers, Bombay Engineers and Madras Engineers, formed with the respective Presidency armies, while British soldiers served in each of the Presidencies' <b>Sappers</b> and Miner Companies, namely Bengal <b>Sappers</b> and Miners, Madras <b>Sappers</b> and Miners and Bombay <b>Sappers</b> and Miners.|$|R
5|$|With the {{northern}} provinces of South Vietnam under their control, North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces {{turned their attention}} to the Mekong Delta region, which formed part of the ARVN III Corps Tactical Zone. During the Offensive, the objective of the combined Communist forces in the zone was the capture of An Lộc, capital of Bình Long Province. The Viet Cong committed three infantry divisions to the mission (5th, 7th and 9th Divisions). North Vietnamese support {{came in the form of}} one artillery formation (69th Artillery Command), one armored regiment (203rd Armored Regiment), two independent regiments (205th and 101st Regiment), and one <b>sapper</b> unit (429th <b>Sapper</b> Group). The Viet Cong's 5th Division was to initiate the offensive by taking Lộc Ninh, while the 9th Division was assigned to An Lộc. The 7th Division was ordered to block National Highway 13 to prevent reinforcements from reaching An Lộc.|$|E
5|$|In November 1914, Bostock {{joined the}} 2nd Signal Troop of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) as a <b>sapper.</b> He landed at Gallipoli on 25April 1915, serving there until August, {{when he was}} {{evacuated}} suffering from dysentery. He returned to active duty in January 1916, and was made lance corporal the following month. Promoted to sergeant, Bostock was posted to Egypt with the ANZAC Mounted Division in April 1916, and saw action against Turkish forces in the Sinai Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Since May 1965, the Viet Cong {{offensive}} in Phước Long Province {{had been in}} full-swing. Beginning on May 10, the Viet Cong 271st Regiment, supported by the 840th Battalion and local <b>sapper</b> units, attacked the district town of Phước Long, capital of the province. Simultaneously, the Viet Cong 272nd Regiment overran South Vietnamese government positions in the sub-sector of Phước Bình. During their brief occupation of Phước Long district, the Viet Cong destroyed several major strategic hamlets in the surrounding areas, such as Ba Ra, Thuan Kiem, Thuan Loi, Phu Rieng, Da Kia, Bu Dop, Duc Bon and Song Be.|$|E

50|$|The onus of resurrecting the Bengal <b>Sappers</b> fell to Colonel JS Dhillon, who was {{the first}} commandant of the Bengal <b>Sappers</b> after India's independence. With minimal {{resources}} and limited personnel, Col Dhillon reorganized and rejuvenated the Bengal <b>Sappers</b> into the leading engineering group of the Army.|$|R
50|$|The Corps {{consists}} of three groups of combat engineers, namely the Madras <b>Sappers,</b> the Bengal <b>Sappers</b> and the Bombay <b>Sappers.</b> A group is roughly analogous to a regiment of Indian infantry, each group consisting {{of a number of}} engineer regiments.

5|$|Upon its release, Goldfinger {{went to the}} top of {{the best-seller}} lists; the novel was broadly well {{received}} by the critics, being favourably compared to contemporary version of both <b>Sapper</b> and John Buchan. Goldfinger was serialised as a daily story and as a comic strip in the Daily Express newspaper, before being the third James Bond feature film of the Eon Productions series, released in 1964 and starring Sean Connery as Bond. Most recently, Goldfinger was adapted for BBC Radio with Toby Stephens as Bond and Sir Ian McKellen as Goldfinger.|$|E
5|$|When the First World War broke out, it was Bassett's {{intention}} {{to join the}} Royal Navy. However, his mother, who was from a family {{with a history of}} service in the British Army, convinced him to enlist in the New Zealand Military Forces. Bassett was not particularly tall and was initially rejected due to his lack of height. He persisted with his attempt to enlist, and eventually joined the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) as a <b>sapper</b> in the Corps of New Zealand Engineers, assigned to the New Zealand Divisional Signal Company.|$|E
5|$|Cyril McNeile, MC (born Herman Cyril McNeile; 1888–1937) was a British {{soldier and}} author. During the First World War he wrote short stories {{based on his}} {{experiences}} in the trenches with the Royal Engineers. These {{were published in the}} Daily Mail under the pseudonym <b>Sapper,</b> the nickname of his regiment, and were later published as collections through Hodder& Stoughton. McNeile also wrote a series of articles titled The Making of an Officer, which appeared under the initials C.N., in five issues of The Times between 8and 14June 1916; these were also subsequently collected together and published. During the course of the war, McNeile wrote more than 80collected and uncollected stories.|$|E
25|$|The NVA used special assault {{troops or}} <b>sappers</b> {{for a wide}} range of missions, {{sometimes}} by themselves, or sometimes as spearheads for a main-force echelon. The Viet Cong also deployed <b>sappers</b> particularly after Tet Offensive losses had made large-scale attacks hazardous. Called dac cong by the Vietnamese, <b>sappers</b> were a force economy measure that could deliver a stinging blow. They were an elite, especially adept at infiltrating and attacking airfields, firebases and other fortified positions. About 50,000 men served in PAVN as <b>sappers,</b> organized into groups of 100-150 men, further broken down into companies of roughly 30-36 men, with sub-divisions into platoons, squads and cells. Specialist troops such as radiomen, medics, and explosives experts were also attached. Many were volunteers. <b>Sappers</b> were often assigned to larger units (regiments, divisions etc.) - carrying out attacks and recon duties, but could also be organized as independent formations. <b>Sappers</b> trained and rehearsed carefully in all aspects of their craft and made use of a variety of equipment and explosive devices, including captured or abandoned American munitions. <b>Sappers</b> also carried out intelligence missions and could work undercover. One of the <b>sappers</b> in the spectacular 1968 Tet Offensive attack against the US Embassy for example, was once a driver to the US Ambassador.|$|R
50|$|In the 1903 {{reorganisation}} of the Indian Army, the Corps {{was renamed}} {{in the newly}} unified Indian Army as the 3rd <b>Sappers</b> & Miners. A mistaken interpretation of the historic records led to the Bombay <b>Sappers</b> being considered as junior to the Madras and Bengal <b>Sappers</b> whereas they could trace an unbroken descent from before the Madras or Bengal <b>Sappers</b> were formed; the case for reversion being taken up {{a number of times}} unsuccessfully, presumably due to inadequate records of the services of the Corps in the late 18th century.|$|R
50|$|In {{recognition}} of the prodigious contribution of the Bombay <b>Sappers</b> in World War I, the title 'Royal' was bestowed on the Corps in 1921 and they became the 3rd Royal Bombay <b>Sappers</b> and Miners. The numeral 3rd was removed in 1923 and the Corps became the Royal Bombay <b>Sappers</b> and Miners and were so called right {{until the end of}} World War II.|$|R
5|$|During each of {{the above}} {{mentioned}} attacks on the firebases and relief column, communist forces suffered horrendous casualties from aircraft and armed helicopter attacks, artillery bombardment, and small arms fire. In each instance, however, they were pressed home with a professional competence and determination that both impressed and shocked those that observed them. According to the official PAVN history, by March the North Vietnamese had managed to amass three infantry divisions (2nd, 304th, 308th), the 64th Regiment of the 320th Division and two independent infantry regiments (27th and 28th), eight regiments of artillery, three engineer regiments, three tank battalions, six anti-aircraft battalions, and eight <b>sapper</b> battalions – approximately 35,000 troops, in the battle area.|$|E
5|$|For a time, no overt {{action was}} taken, and the plans {{continued}} to evolve. A further refinement {{of the plan}} was developed by William and McGeorge Bundy on 29 November 1964, with a more moderate target list, which the Joint Chiefs opposed. No action was taken while these, and other, plans were considered. But matters {{came to a head}} with the attack on Camp Holloway on 7 February 1965, which demanded immediate action, and resulted in a reprisal raid known as Operation Flaming Dart. A <b>sapper</b> raid against an American enlisted men's billet at Qui Nhon on the 10th led to Flaming Dart II. These small-scale operations were launched against the southern region of the country, where the bulk of North Vietnam's ground forces and supply dumps were located.|$|E
5|$|Hergé {{had hoped}} that being the author of an ongoing comic strip would improve his job prospects, for {{at the time he}} was {{beginning}} to develop a reputation as a designer of postcards, stationary, and advertisements. Rather than representing an example of a comic as the medium would come to be understood in the following decade, The Adventures of Totor consisted of square boxes containing illustrations with the captions written separately underneath, as was the style found in French comic creator Christophe's works La Famille Fenouillard (The Fenouillard Family) and Sapeur Camembert (<b>Sapper</b> Camembert). Initially using four boxes per page, as the series progressed this was increased to six and then eight, with each page ending on a cliffhanger.|$|E
50|$|Madras Engineer Group (MEG), informally {{known as}} the Madras <b>Sappers,</b> is an {{engineer}} group of the Corps of Engineers of the Indian Army.

5|$|On 2 February 1971 North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces {{launched}} their dry season offensive (Campaign 74B) {{to recapture the}} Plain of Jars. PAVN forces {{taking part in the}} operation included the 316th Division, the 165th Regiment of the 312th Division, the 866th Infantry Regiment, and three <b>sapper</b> battalions (the 13th, 27th, and 41st). Communist forces rolled west and southwest, securing territory in anticipation of a possible cease-fire. By February they had occupied the entire Plain of Jars, Long Tieng had been surrounded, and, {{for the first time since}} 1962, Pathet Lao forces were camped within sight of the royal capital of Luang Prabang.|$|E
5|$|The trail {{came to a}} {{dead end}} at the steep banks of the Se Pone River and the force was trapped. The North Vietnamese closed in and savage rearguard actions ensued. Two bulldozers were finally helilifted into the ARVN {{perimeter}} to create a ford, and {{the survivors of the}} force crossed into South Vietnam on 23 March. By the 25th, 45 days after the beginning of the operation, the remainder of the South Vietnamese force that had survived had left Laos behind. The forward base at Khe Sanh had also come under increasing artillery bombardment and <b>sapper</b> attacks and by 6 April it was abandoned and Operation Lam Son 719 was over.|$|E
5|$|Upon being {{appointed}} corporate {{head of the}} IBM Design Program in 1989, Tom Hardy, {{initiated a}} strategic design management effort, in collaboration with IBM design consultant Richard <b>Sapper,</b> {{to return to the}} roots of the IBM Design Program first established in 1956 by Eliot Noyes, Paul Rand and Charles Eames. The intent was to reprise IBM's brand image with customer experience-driven quality, approachability and contemporary product innovation. The highly successful IBM ThinkPad was the first product to emerge from this strategy in 1992 and, together with other innovative, award-winning products that followed, served to position design as a strategic asset for IBM's brand turnaround efforts initiated in 1993 by newly appointed CEO Louis V. Gerstner, Jr.|$|E

5|$|A diabetic, Keenor {{suffered}} from disabilities {{stemming from a}} hard-living lifestyle {{that may have been}} a consequence of his tough upbringing. Following his retirement from football, he found it difficult to find work due to his ill-health and it became increasingly hard to earn money. Supporters of his former club Cardiff City held a collection during one league match to raise money for Keenor and his family and the Football Association of Wales also organised a fund for him as well as donating him some money. After a long spell in hospital for treatment of his diabetes, Keenor moved his family to Lamberhurst where he and his wife ran a corner shop and also raised chickens to be sold at Christmas time. He later volunteered for the Territorial Army, serving as a <b>sapper</b> in the Royal Engineers, but was discharged in June 1939 due to continuing problems with his diabetes treatment, just months {{before the start of the}} Second World War. Two of his sons, Frederick and Alfred were both killed in action during the conflict. Keenor and his wife later visited the village of Fruges in northern France where Alfred's plane had been shot down.|$|E
5|$|As all cadets are {{commissioned}} {{as second}} lieutenants upon graduation, military and leadership education is nested with academic instruction. Military training and discipline {{fall under the}} purview of the Office of the Commandant. Entering freshmen, or fourth class cadets, are referred to as New Cadets, and enter the academy on Reception Day or R-day, which marks the start of cadet basic training (CBT), known colloquially as Beast Barracks, or simply Beast. Most cadets consider Beast to be their most difficult time at the academy because of the transition from civilian to military life. Their second summer, cadets undergo cadet field training (CFT) at nearby Camp Buckner, where they train in more advanced field craft and military skills. During a cadet's third summer, they may serve as instructors for CBT or CFT. Rising Firstie (senior) cadets also spend one-month training at Camp Buckner, where they train for modern tactical situations that they will soon face as new platoon leaders. Cadets also have the opportunity during their second, third and fourth summers to serve in active army units and military schools around the world. The schools include Airborne, Air Assault, <b>Sapper,</b> Pathfinder, etc.|$|E
