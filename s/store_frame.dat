50|$|Program stores also {{contained}} permanent data, {{and could not}} be written online. Instead, the aluminum memory cards, also called twistor planes, had to be removed in groups of 128 so their permanent magnets could be written offline by a motorized writer, an improvement over the non motorized single card writer used in Project Nike. All memory frames, all busses, and all software and data were fully dual modular redundant. The dual CCs operated in lockstep and the detection of a mismatch triggered an automatic sequencer to change the combination of CC, busses and memory modules until a configuration was reached that could pass a sanity check. Busses were twisted pairs, one pair for each address, data or control bit, connected at the CC and at each <b>store</b> <b>frame</b> by coupling transformers, and ending in terminating resistors at the last frame.|$|E

A differential time-lapse technique allows us to remove the unnecessary data from the normal video, {{in order to save}} the time to visualization and storage space. Differential Time Lapse Video is non-periodic time lapse technique. In differential time lapse video, each frame are compared with previously last <b>stored</b> <b>frame,</b> If some information/movement is found in the frame than <b>frame</b> is <b>stored</b> and considered as last <b>stored</b> <b>frame,</b> else frame is discarded. The differential time lapse video can be generated by pixel-to-pixel bit mapping technique, motion detection technique, edge comparison technique etc. In this paper we implement the motion detection criterion as frame selection criterion to generate differential time lapse video in real time application. The analysis of moving objects is done by detection of variations in intensity over time in the environment Here we are concerned with determinist modeling that is images difference, to detect the moving objects masks.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a imaging modality that works by transiently masking image-subregions during a single exposure of a CCD frame. By offsetting subregion exposure time, temporal information is embedded within each <b>stored</b> <b>frame,</b> allowing simultaneous {{acquisition of a}} full high spatial resolution image and a high-speed image sequence without increasing bandwidth. The technique is demonstrated by imaging calcium transients in heart cells at 250 Hz with a 10 Hz megapixel camera. Conventional cameras capture images at a fixed spatial and temporal resolution. Events that occur faster than the camera frame integration time (Ti) appear blurred (if moving) or as an average light intensity (when still). We propose a pixel multiplexing (PM) paradigm for imaging that allows simultaneous highspeed and high-resolution image capture 1. The method adds a high-resolution shutter array that can open and close at speeds that create pixel expose times Te shorter than Ti, so that exposure of detector subregions is independently controllable. A high-speed image sequence can be embedded in a single <b>stored</b> <b>frame</b> using the following scheme (Fig. 1) : 1) The image detector integrates and reads out a frame in the standard fashion, every Ti seconds. 2) A shutter array produces a pattern of open/closed exposures during Ti so that spatially dispersed pixel clusters (each consisting {{of one or more}} pixels) are exposed at the same time for Te = Ti×n- 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In Wyner-Ziv coding of video, a {{frame is}} encoded {{independent}} of other frames, but decoded using adjacent frames as side information. In this work we extend our system by Wyner-Ziv encoding the residual of a frame {{with respect to}} a known reference at the encoder. At the decoder, better side information is generated through motion estimation and is used to reconstruct the frame. We show through experimental results that by allowing the encoder this additional complexity of <b>frame</b> <b>store</b> and <b>frame</b> subtraction, we achieve better rate-distortion performance compared to previous Wyner-Ziv coding schemes.

The primary network is willing to share its licensed spectrum with the secondary network as an exchange for cooperation. Thereinto, a primary transmitter (PT) tends to communicate with primary receiver (PR) with its own spectrum and a secondary transmitter (ST) communicates with secondary receiver (SR) by using the leased spectrum. As introduced, by employing the effective capacity theory a cross-layer-based transmitter structure is formulated, in which an infinite queue (or buffer) operating in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) mode is implemented at the data link layer to <b>store</b> <b>frames</b> to be transmitted. Frames from upper layers are put into the queue. Then at the physical layer, frames from the queue are divided into bit-streams. The reverse operations are executed at the receiver side.|$|R

The <b>stored</b> <b>frames</b> leave each output port according to a fixed priority FIFO policy. Overflow of these buffers must be avoided at all cost to prevent data loss. Although the AFDX standard determines the minimum buffer size dedicated to an output port, the actual length of each priority buffer, is a designer decision.
