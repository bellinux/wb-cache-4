25|$|Favored {{locations}} {{include those}} with narrow shelves (volcanic islands), steep (15-20 degrees) offshore slopes, and relatively <b>smooth</b> <b>sea</b> floors. These sites minimize {{the length of}} the intake pipe. A land-based plant could be built well inland from the shore, offering more protection from storms, or on the beach, where the pipes would be shorter. In either case, easy access for construction and operation helps lower costs.|$|E
25|$|The {{builders}} {{had tested}} the hull form {{in their own}} tank, and hoped to attain a speed of 20 knots (37.04km/h) with the turbine machinery. On 14 June the first steam trial was supervised personally by C. A. Parsons and John Williamson, then on 17 June during manoeuvring trials in calm weather the mean speed of two runs over the measured mile at Skelmorlie was 18.66 knots (34.56km/h). After full hull cleaning at Scott's of Greenock a further series of trials took place on 24 June: in seven return runs over the mile, the best mean speed attained was 19.7 knots (36.48km/h). On {{the next day at}} the Pointhouse yard of A. & J. Inglis the central propeller of 4ft (1.22 m) diameter was exchanged for one of 4ft 9inches (1.45 m) diameter, and the outer propellers of 2ft 10inches (0.86 m) diameter were exchanged for propellers 3ft 4inches (1.02 m) diameter. Trials on 26 June with <b>smooth</b> <b>sea</b> conditions and a light breeze achieved a mean of 20.48 knots (37.93km/h) and a fastest single run at 20.57 knots (38.1km/h). At the official trial on 28 June, invited guests came aboard off Craigendoran, and the ship then sailed to Campbeltown with intermediate visits to Dunoon, Rothesay, Largs, Fairlie and Lochranza, where Duchess of Hamilton waited with a special party of members of the Institute of Naval Architects. The two ships raced down Kilbrannan Sound and King Edward passed the paddle steamer without difficulty. A dinner in the after saloon was presided over by Peter Denny, who with other speakers commented on the speed and smoothness of the turbine steamer, in contrast to the rhythmic surging motion and vibration associated with all paddle steamers.|$|E
500|$|In the 1950s, the US Navy {{considered}} the internal arrangements of a submarine aircraft carrier that could carry {{three of these}} aircraft. Stored in pressure chambers that would not protrude from the hull, they would be raised by a portside elevator just aft of the sail and set to take off on their own on a <b>smooth</b> <b>sea</b> but catapulted aft in a higher sea. The program only reached the [...] "writing on a napkin" [...] stage, for two problems were not addressed: the hole for the elevator would have seriously weakened the hull and the load of a laden elevator would also be difficult to transmit to the hull structure.|$|E

60|$|The seamen rose {{simultaneously}} {{at their}} oars, and by an united effort obtained {{the command of}} their boat; which, after making a few sudden ascents, and as many heavy pitches in the breakers, gained the <b>smoother</b> <b>seas</b> of the swelling ocean, and stemmed the waters in a direction for {{the place where the}} Alacrity was supposed to be in waiting.|$|R
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of 6 May, Lusitania was [...] west of {{southern}} Ireland. By 05:00 on 7 May she reached a point [...] west south west of Fastnet Rock (off {{the southern tip of}} Ireland), where she met the patrolling boarding vessel Partridge. By 06:00, heavy fog had arrived and extra lookouts were posted. As the ship came closer to Ireland, Captain Turner ordered depth soundings to be made and at 08:00 for speed to be reduced to eighteen knots, then to 15 knots and for the foghorn to be sounded. Some of the passengers were disturbed that the ship appeared to be advertising her presence. By 10:00 the fog began to lift, by noon it had been replaced by bright sunshine over a clear <b>smooth</b> <b>sea</b> and speed increased to 18 knots.|$|E

60|$|Through {{the sparse}} cocoanuts they gazed seaward. An orderly {{succession}} of huge <b>smooth</b> <b>seas</b> was rolling {{down upon the}} coral shore. For some minutes they gazed on the strange sight and talked in low voices, and in those few minutes it was manifest to all that the waves were increasing in size. It was uncanny, this rising sea in a dead calm, and their voices unconsciously sank lower. Old Parlay shocked them with his abrupt cackle.|$|R
60|$|She had discovered, too, {{in these}} {{intimate}} days, {{that he had}} the Northman's temperament; she both loved and dreaded his moods. And sometimes, when the yacht glided over <b>smoother</b> <b>seas,</b> it was his pleasure to read to her, even poetry and the great epics. That he should be fond of the cruel Scotch ballads she was not surprised; but his familiarity with the book of Job, and his love for it, astonished her. It was a singular library that he had put on board the 'Adhemar'.|$|R
2500|$|Finland {{arrived at}} Antwerp {{on the morning}} of 24 June after a ten-day voyage over <b>smooth</b> <b>seas.</b> While the ship took on stores, the athletes {{completed}} their training at a local athletic club. Sailing at noon on 26 June, Finland reached Sweden four days later. There were no injuries during the entirety of the voyage, and, unlike the trip of the next American Olympic delegation in 1920—when the so-called [...] "Mutiny of the Matoika" [...] took place—no threats of a strike because of bad conditions aboard the ship.|$|R

25|$|The ship ran aground on a {{sandbank}} off Southampton on 14 April 1947 and was re-floated {{the following}} day. In 1955, during an annual overhaul at Southampton, England, Queen Elizabeth was fitted with underwater fin stabilizers {{to smooth the}} ride in rough seas. Two fins were fitted {{on each side of}} the hull. The fins were retractable into the hull to save fuel in <b>smooth</b> <b>seas</b> and for docking. On 29 July 1959, she was in a collision with the American cargo ship American Hunter in foggy conditions in New York Harbour and was holed above the waterline.|$|R
5000|$|Tampa {{passed a}} towline to the {{stricken}} ship, {{but it soon}} parted with the sharp crack of a pistol shot and fouled the cutter's screw. Tampa herself drifted perilously close to shore before the cutter [...] towed her out of danger. When conducted in <b>smooth</b> <b>seas,</b> operations to save lives are difficult enough; the gale raging off the New Jersey shore {{on the morning of}} 8 September 1934 made matters markedly worse. Nevertheless, the Coast Guardsmen performed feats of great heroism in rescuing the liner's passengers and crew from the storm-tossed waves. During the rescue, Tampa had accounted for 140 survivors.|$|R

2500|$|In fine {{weather and}} <b>smooth</b> <b>seas</b> on 5 August 1910, Princess May, another CPR steamship, {{grounded}} on Sentinel Island {{within sight of}} Vanderbilt Reef. [...] All aboard were evacuated to the nearby light station, and the vessel itself was later removed from the rock with relatively minor damage. It was Princess May that CPR dispatched on hearing of the grounding of Princess Sophia {{to pick up her}} passengers who they presumed would be soon evacuated. [...] While Princess May grounding had been in early August, and not late October, still there were other vessels with Princess Sophia grounding and the stranded ship seemed to be secure.|$|R
60|$|Went out early. Clear morning. Cool. Rippling sea. Fog {{rolled down}} like a pale-gray wall. Misty, veiled, vague, strange, opaque, silent, wet, cold, heavy! It enveloped us.

60|$|In a word, {{it being}} a <b>smooth</b> <b>sea,</b> and little wind, I took his advice, and laid her aboard. Immediately our men entered the ship, where we found a large ship, with upwards of 600 negroes, men and women, boys and girls, and not one Christian or white man on board.|$|E
60|$|When the Christian host {{arrived in}} sight of this valley, a {{squadron}} was hovering on the <b>smooth</b> <b>sea</b> before it displaying the banner of Castile.

60|$|Nest. With due {{observance}} of thy sovereign seat, Great Agamemnon, Nestor shall apply Thy well-weighed words. In struggling with misfortunes Lies the true proof of virtue: On <b>smooth</b> <b>seas,</b> How many bauble-boats dare set their sails, And make an equal way with firmer vessels! But let the tempest once enrage that sea, And then behold the strong-ribbed argosie, Bounding between {{the ocean and}} the air, Like Perseus mounted on his Pegasus. Then where are those weak rivals of the main? Or, to avoid the tempest, fled to port, Or made a prey to Neptune. Even thus Do empty show, and true-prized worth, divide In storms of fortune.|$|R
50|$|At {{approximately}} 20:20, the <b>Sea</b> <b>Smooth</b> {{crashed into}} the Lamma IV on the port side. The bow of the <b>Sea</b> <b>Smooth</b> hit {{the stern of the}} Lamma IV, rupturing the ship's two watertight compartments and thereby allowing them to quickly fill with water. The ship soon capsized with the rear sinking into the sea. The vessel reportedly went down so quickly that more than 100 passengers were thrown into the water unprotected despite the abundance of life-vests on board. The ferry left the scene after the accident and continued on to Yung Shue Wan pier. The front of <b>Sea</b> <b>Smooth</b> was damaged and its captain was also sent to the local clinic after the accident, along with several passengers, for injuries.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} day, {{the planes}} were again sent out on patrols while the ship upped anchor and proceeded for Tawi Tawi, receiving word en route that the PBY's were {{to return to}} Lake Lanao in Mindanao and the OS2U's were to rendezvous with the ship at Tawi Tawi. Although she had never hoisted aboard any aircraft before, William B. Preston's bluejackets rigged up a crude cradle between the two 50-foot motor-boats aft and provided padding for the Kingfisher's center float with mattresses and life jackets. One OS2U was taken aboard and berthed in this fashion while the other was towed astern. <b>Smooth</b> <b>seas</b> and a 15-knot pace facilitated the towing operation, and the two planes arrived safely at Tarakan, Borneo.|$|R
60|$|The {{fleet of}} kayaks converged towards the fish like {{a flock of}} locusts. Despite his utmost efforts, Leo could not do more than keep up in rear of the hunters, for the sharp shuttle-like kayaks shot like arrows over the <b>smooth</b> <b>sea,</b> while his clumsier boat {{required}} greater force to propel it.|$|E
60|$|On {{our next}} day out we had <b>smooth</b> <b>sea</b> all morning, with great, slow-running swells, long and high, with deep hollows between. Vast, heaving bosom of the deep! It was majestic.

60|$|In a {{few minutes}} the canoe, with its {{precious}} freight and Thursday at the steering-paddle, was thrust through the wild surf, and went skimming over the <b>smooth</b> <b>sea</b> beyond.
