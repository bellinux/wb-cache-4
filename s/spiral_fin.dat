The working fluid is freon- 11 with an inlet temperature of 22. 2 C (approximately 21 C subcooling). The coolant channel's exit pressure and mass velocity are 0. 19 M Pa (absolute) and 0. 21 Mg/sq. ms, respectively.

One of the {{effective}} {{forms of energy}} saving and rational using of heat during the burning of organic fuels, as well as {{protection of the environment}} against thermal pollution, is the recovery of living heat of industrial furnaces, steam and heat water boilers.

For the random roughness the heat-transfer coefficient was above the smooth tube value, for comparable flow conditions, by over 60 percent at a Reynolds number of 30, 000. Larger percentage improvements can be expected for higher Reynolds numbers and for fluids having higher Prandtl numbers. Improvements in performance, based on equal pumping power for augmented and smooth tubes, of about 50 percent were observed. The heat-transfer characteristics for tape-generated swirl flow through rough tubes were investigated in order to determine the interaction of swirl flow and roughness effects. For the particular range of parameters covered, for equal flow rates, the maximum improvement in heat transfer with swirl flow in smooth tubes was 70 percent, whereas with swirl flow in rough tubes, the improvement was as much as 100 percent. The heat-transfer coefficient for rough tube swirl flow was accurately correlated by a modification of an additive expression previously suggested for prediction of smooth tube swirl flow data.

40|$|Production of {{aluminum}} {{is a very}} energy intensive process which is increasingly {{more important in the}} USA. This project concentrated on the materials issues associated with recovery of energy from the flue gas stream in the secondary industry where scrap and recycled metal are melted in large furnaces using gas fired burners. Recuperators are one method used to transfer heat from the flue gas to the air intended for use in the gas burners. By preheating this combustion air, less fuel has to be used to raise the gas temperature to the desired level. Recuperators have been successfully used to preheat the air, however, in many cases the metallic recuperator tubes have a relatively limited lifetime – 6 to 9 months. The intent of this project was to determine the cause of the rapid tube degradation and then to recommend alternative materials or operating conditions to prolong life of the recuperator tubes. The first step to understanding degradation of the tubes was to examine exposed tubes to identify the corrosion products. Analyses of the surface scales showed primarily iron oxides rather than chromium oxide suggesting the tubes were probably cycled to relatively high temperatures to the extent that cycling and subsequent oxide spalling reduced the surface concentration of chromium below a critical level. To characterize the temperatures reached by the tubes, thermocouples were mounted on selected tubes and the temperatures measured. During the several hour furnace cycle, tube temperatures well above 1000 °C were regularly recorded and, on some occasions, temperatures of more than 1100 °C were measured. Further temperature characterization was done with an infrared camera, and this camera clearly showed the variations in temperature across the first row of tubes in the four recuperator modules. Computational fluid dynamics was used to model the flow of combustion air in the tubes and the flue gas around the outside of the tubes. This modeling showed the distribution of air in the tubes was not at all uniform, and it was strongly affected by velocity and the turbulence created by items in the lower plenum such as the fork lift slots, structural members, and broken <b>spiral</b> <b>fins</b> originally intended to promote non-linear flow in the tubes. Finite element modeling of the stresses developed between tubes in the first and second rows showed how stresses could become large enough to account for the bending and bowing of tubes in the first row. To prevent rapid degradation and subsequently short lifetimes of recuperator tubes two approaches were offered. Alloys that form an aluminum oxide surface layer {{would be more likely to}} survive the excursions to very high temperatures. However, availability of these alloys in the tube sizes required might be an issue as might the ability of welding these alloys to the other recuperator components. The other approach would entail improving the design of the recuperator module and to change operating procedures to avoid conditions where very hot flue gases are flowing across the recuperator tubes at times when reduced combustion air is flowing through the recuperator tubes...|$|R

However, the effect of the spiral angle could not be clearly established in those investigations, because other geometric parameters affecting the heat transfer performance such as fin height, fin thickness, apex angle were also varied. The influence of the spiral angle on the heat transfer performance during condensation inside spiralled micro-fin tubes having all other geometric parameters the same was experimentally investigated in this study. A new experimental-based predictive correlation was developed for practical design of this specific class of micro-fin tubes. Tests were conducted for condensation of R 22, R 134 a and R 407 c inside a smooth and three micro-fin tubes having spiral angles of 10, 18 and 37 degrees. Experimental results indicated a heat transfer augmentation due to heat transfer area increase. As the spiral angle was increased, the heat transfer area increased causing a substantial heat transfer augmentation.
