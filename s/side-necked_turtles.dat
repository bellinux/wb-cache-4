5|$|There are {{fourteen}} extant {{families of}} the order Testudines, an order of reptile commonly known as turtles, tortoises and terrapins. The testudines {{are some of the}} most ancient reptiles alive, with only the tuataras considered more primitive. There are approximately 300 extant species and 97 genera of testudines, split into two suborders: the Cryptodirans and the Pleurodirans. The distinction between these two suborders is based on the mode in which they cover their head and neck. The Pleurodirans, also called the <b>side-necked</b> <b>turtles,</b> have long necks, and fold them sideways to align them with the shell. The Pelomedusidae and Chelidae are the only extant families of pleurodires. The Cryptodirans pull their neck straight back to conceal their head within the shell. The Carettochelyidae, Cheloniidae, Chelydridae, Dermatemydidae, Dermochelyidae, Emydidae, Kinosternidae, Testudinidae and Trionychidae are all cryptodires, although the ability to retract the head has been lost in the sea turtles (Cheloniidae and Dermochelyidae). A third order, the Paracryptodirans, are extinct.|$|E

50|$|The Pleurodira {{are one of}} the two living suborders of turtles, {{the other}} being the Cryptodira. In many cases in the {{nomenclature}} of animals, ranks such as suborder are considered of little importance apart from nomenclatural or taxonomic reasons. However, {{this is not the case}} with the suborders of the turtles. This division represents a very deep evolutionary divide between two very different types of turtles. The physical differences between them, although anatomical and largely internal, are nonetheless significant, and the zoogeographic implications of them are substantial. The Pleurodira are known more commonly as the <b>side-necked</b> <b>turtles</b> and the name Pleurodira quite literally translates to side neck, whereas the Cryptodira are known as hidden-necked turtles. The Pleurodira turtles are restricted to the Southern Hemisphere, largely to Australia, South America, and Africa. Within the Pleurodira, two living families are represented: Chelidae, also known as the Austro-South American <b>side-necked</b> <b>turtles,</b> and the Pelomedusidae, also known as the Afro-South American <b>side-necked</b> <b>turtles.</b>|$|E
50|$|The related Podocnemididae {{are either}} {{treated as a}} {{distinct}} family, or as a subfamily (Podocnemidinae) in the Pelomedusidae. The African <b>side-necked</b> <b>turtles</b> are then also demoted to subfamily rank, as the Pelomedusinae.|$|E

50|$|Turtles {{are divided}} into two extant suborders: the Cryptodira and the Pleurodira. The Cryptodira is {{the larger of the}} two groups and {{includes}} all the marine turtles, the terrestrial tortoises, and many of the freshwater turtles. The Pleurodira are sometimes known as the <b>side-necked</b> <b>turtles,</b> a reference to the way they retract their heads into their shells.

50|$|Pelomedusidae is {{a family}} of {{freshwater}} turtles native to sub-Saharan Africa, with a single species, Pelomedusa subrufa, also found in Yemen. They {{range in size from}} 12 to 45 cm in carapace length, and are generally roundish in shape. They are unable to fully withdraw their heads into their shells, instead drawing them to the side and folding them beneath the upper edge of their shells, hence are called African <b>side-necked</b> <b>turtles.</b>|$|E
50|$|Chelodina, collectively {{known as}} snake-necked turtles, {{is a large}} and diverse genus of long-necked Chelid turtles with a {{complicated}} nomenclatural history. Although in the past Macrochelodina and Macrodiremys have been considered separate genera and prior to that all the same, they are now considered subgenera of the Chelodina. Chelodina is an ancient group of Chelid turtles native to Australia, New Guinea, the Indonesian Rote Island, and East Timor. The turtles within this subgenus are small to medium-sized, with oval shaped carapace. They are <b>side-necked</b> <b>turtles,</b> meaning they tuck their head partially {{around the side of}} their body when threatened instead of directly backwards.|$|E
50|$|The East African black {{mud turtle}} has a smooth, domed {{carapace}} with a length of 5.1-7.9 in. The carapace is typically dark brown, gray, or black, often with yellow or dark markings on the margins. They are rather dull in color like most of their genus. The plastron is hinged. The underside of the turtle can be brown, grey, black, or yellow. The upper jaw has a blunt, smooth shape. The head of an adult is generally uniform in color. As in all <b>side-necked</b> <b>turtles,</b> the neck retracts the head sideways instead of vertically into the shell. This species may {{be confused with the}} West African mud turtle.|$|E
50|$|Sankuchemys is an extinct genus of <b>side-necked</b> <b>turtle</b> which {{existed in}} India {{during the late}} Cretaceous period. It was first named by Eugene S.

50|$|The African {{helmeted turtle}} (Pelomedusa subrufa), {{also known as}} the marsh terrapin, {{crocodile}} turtle, or in the pet trade as African <b>side-necked</b> <b>turtle,</b> is an omnivorous side-necked terrapin that naturally occurs in fresh and stagnant water bodies throughout much of Sub-Saharan Africa, and even in southern Yemen.|$|R
