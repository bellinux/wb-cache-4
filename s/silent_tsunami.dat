50|$|The Nicholas Institute was {{established}} in 2005. In its first decade, it has led a variety of influential projects. The Nicholas Institute advised California on several aspects of {{the design of the}} country’s first economy-wide cap-and-trade program for greenhouse gases. The Nicholas Institute brought attention to one of the world’s most critical environmental problems by providing the first estimates of global carbon dioxide emissions from the destruction of coastal and marine ecosystems. Through the seminal report, A <b>Silent</b> <b>Tsunami,</b> the Nicholas Institute provided a material contribution to legislation aimed at dramatically improving access to clean water and sanitation around the world. And the Nicholas Institute helped natural resource managers connect their decisions to things people care about with the first guidebook to present a scientifically defensible approach to ecosystem services assessment.|$|E
40|$|Today, {{the global}} food supply system is groaning under {{the strain of}} skyrocketing demand, soaring cost of inputs, {{depleted}} stocks, crop loss due to drought, floods and severe weather. Last June, I warned we were facing a perfect storm for the world's most vulnerable. Today, I believe {{we are in the}} eye of that storm…a <b>silent</b> <b>tsunami</b> that respects no borders. Most do not know what has hit them (Josette Sheeran, UN World Food Programme, 6 May 2008). The World Food Programme reports that there are 795 million people worldwide who are undernourished (UNWFP, 2015). The Global Sustainability Institute has predicted that ‘catastrophic’ food shortages by 2040 will cause worldwide riots and death, and society as we know it ‘will collapse’ (Dore, 2015). Such forecasts are indeed alarming, however, the rhetoric of ‘warning’ and ‘emergency’ about food production and distribution are not new. In 2009 the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon stated that food security was a ‘forgotten crisis’ (Ki-Moon, 2009) and as the opening quotation reveals, the future shortages of world food supplies is an accumulating and dangerously quiet but deadly ‘tsunami...|$|E
40|$|Results of {{detailed}} mechanism studies of great earthquakes are used {{together with their}} repeat times to {{determine the amount of}} seismic slip along various subduction zones. Comparison of the seismic slip with the rate of plate motion suggests that, in Chile, and possibly Alaska, the seismic slip rate is comparable to the rate of plate motion while, in the Kuriles and Northern Japan, the seismic slip constitutes only a very small portion, approximately 1 / 4, of the total slip. In the Sanriku region, and to the south of it, the relative amount of seismic slip is even smaller. These results suggest that in Chile and Alaska the coupling and interaction between the oceanic and continental lithosphere are very strong, resulting in great earthquakes with a very large rupture zone, and in break-off of the undergoing lithosphere at shallow depths. In the Kuriles and Northern Japan, the oceanic and continental lithosphere are largely decoupled, so that the slip becomes largely aseismic, and the rupture length of earthquakes reduced. The reduced interaction at the inter-plate boundary may allow the oceanic lithosphere to subduct more easily and to form a continuous Benioff zone extending to depths. It may also facilitate ridge subduction beneath island arcs, which may {{play an important role in}} the formation of marginal seas such as the Japan Sea. The decoupling is also evidenced by <b>silent</b> or <b>tsunami</b> earthquakes [e. g., the 1896 Sanriku earthquake], great intra-plate normal-fault earthquakes [e. g., the 1933 Sanriku earthquake], and crustal deformation. A natural extension of this concept of inter-plate decoupling is the spontaneous sinking of the oceanic lithosphere with a consequent retreating subduction. Retreating subduction may be an important mechanism in the format ion of marginal seas such as the Philippine Sea, and explains the complete lack of major shallow earthquake activity along some subduction zones such as the Izu-Bonin-Mariana arc...|$|R
