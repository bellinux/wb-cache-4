40|$|Lithium-ion {{batteries}} are shipped worldwide with many limitations implemented {{to ensure safety}} and to prevent loss of cargo. Many of the transportation guidelines focus on new batteries; however, the <b>shipment</b> <b>requirements</b> for used or degraded {{batteries are}} less clear. Current international regulations regarding the air transport of lithium-ion batteries are critically reviewed. The pre-shipping tests are outlined and evaluated to assess their ability to fully mitigate risks during battery transport. In particular, the guidelines for shipping second-use batteries are considered. Because the electrochemical state of previously used batteries is inherently {{different from that of}} new batteries, additional considerations must be made to evaluate these types of cells. Additional tests are suggested that evaluate the risks of second-use batteries, {{which may or may not}} contain incipient faults...|$|E
40|$|Because rail is {{the only}} {{cost-effective}} transportation mode available to many agricultural shippers who are not located near markets or waterway transportation, long-term trends in railroad service and capacity are critically important to U. S. agriculture. These long-term trends are important because they will define {{the size of the}} rail network to which agricultural shippers will have access, the minimum <b>shipment</b> <b>requirements</b> that rail shippers and receivers will have to meet, the amount of intramodal competition that will exist in the industry, and, ultimately, the levels of rail service and capacity that will be available to agricultural shippers and receivers in the 21 st century. In this paper, the long-term trends in railroad services and capacity for U. S. agriculture are identified and described, particularly in terms of what these trends portend for agricultural shippers absent any change in the economically deregulated environment within which the U. S. rail industry has operated during the past 20 years. Before the trends are discussed, however, introductory material on how the U. S. railroad system has evolved over that time will be presented. After the long-term trends are presented, the paper concludes with a brief discussion of the likely long-term implications to U. S. agriculture of these long-term trends in railroad services and capacity...|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of efficient logistics management for chemical industry {{considered to be}} one of the important issues in process industries. Motivated from a chemical factory operating in Turkey, cost efficient daily logistics planning using multiple third party logistics providers (3 PL) with different contracting schemes are analyzed. In order to reduce planning time and maximize the physical vehicle capacity utilization, problem of the company is formulated as a mixed integer mathematical model, and a two-phase solution approach is proposed. Using the real life daily <b>shipment</b> <b>requirement</b> data the proposed model and the solution methodology is tested. Furthermore, impact of various company practices and types of different transportation pricing schemes are analyzed to better design 3 PL contracts. The initial results are very promising where optimum solution for large scaled problem can be obtained in seconds and the daily shipment planning can be updated dynamically whenever it is necessary. The analysis indicates that cost savings through holistic planning is robust to contracting schemes and specific clauses are not always needed to guarantee certain service quality. We believe that the efficiency achieved through the integration of such techniques can become highly attractive for further applications in the industry...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Reducing {{environmental}} impact is increasingly important for companies and this includes concerns regarding emissions from purchased freight transport services. When shippers order freight transport services, according to purchasing agreements, <b>shipment</b> specific <b>requirements</b> are specified, which can restrict the planning options of the transport provider, thereby influencing how the transport is performed {{and the resulting}} environmental performance. Therefore, shippers’ daily processes for ordering freight transport are of interest. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to explore how the shipper´s freight transport ordering process influences the logistical variables in the framework of Piecyk and McKinnon (2010) : modal split, handling factor, average length of haul, lading factor, empty running, fuel efficiency and carbon intensity of fuel, in order to understand in what way CO 2 emissions can be affected by the freight transport ordering process. Research approach: An explorative multiple case study of routine freight transport ordering processes at manufacturing companies was carried out. Shippers were interviewed to describe the transport ordering process as well as how related internal processes provide input to the process. The analysis combines the information from the cases with literature that describes logistical variables, and results in a description of how the transport ordering process can influence logistical variables. Findings and Originality: The study identified several connections from the freight transport ordering process to logistical variables and that the potential to reduce CO 2 emissions partly depends on input from other processes. Examples of findings are, first, that timing of information input to the transport ordering process regarding transport requirements can influence lading factor and empty running, by affecting opportunities for the transport provider to plan vehicle utilisation. Secondly, communication between the sales staff and the transport ordering staff about customer needs regarding delivery times can affect urgency of transport and thereby influence modal split. Thirdly, information input to the transport ordering process regarding dimensions can affect planning of space required for the shipment and the utilisation of ordered space, thereby influencing lading factor. Research impact: The paper contributes by process descriptions of the freight transport ordering processes, which has been rarely covered in previous research. Also, a general model of the process is proposed. It also contributes to the framework used by Piecyk and McKinnon (2010) by showing influence from the transport ordering process on logistical variables. Practical impact: Shippers can learn how the configuration of the freight transport ordering process can influence logistical variables. This is important in order to be able to configure the freight transport ordering process to accommodate environmental considerations and reduce CO 2 emissions from freight transport...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an extensive {{overview of the}} economic importance {{and development of the}} Flemish maritime ports, over the period 1995 - 2002. Focuing on the three major variables of value added, employment and investment, it also provides some information about the financial situation of a few vital segments in each port. In addition, it includes figures with respect to the ongoing growth of several cargo traffic segments and attempts to establish a link between these and the progress of the production in the industries at stake. The breakthrough of this research consists of evaluating the indirect effects of the sectors in question in terms of value added and employment. A few refinements have also been made, such as the routine geographical and functional selection of companies according to the cluster they belong to (NACE-Bel code approuch), the limitation of administrative work incurred, the review of the company-size analysis, etc. Annual reports data from the Central Balance Sheet have been computed for the calculation of direct effects, the study of financial ratios and the analysis of the social balance sheet. For the estimation of indirect effects, Supply and Use Tables form the National Accounts Institute have been resorted to. The developments in the maritime ports sector are numerous nowadays, namely in the Hamburg - Le Havre range: concentration of capital, privatization of ports logistics services, expansion and dispersion of foreign trade, the internationalization of the production and consumption patterns (e. g. increase in containerized <b>shipments),</b> the latest <b>requirements</b> of world trade concerning transport and distribution. The increase in scale and specialization of the vessels inevitably impact on the operation of the ports. Production, trade and transport are not longer considered as individual, isolated activities, but are integrated in a single system. Therefore, ports have to evolve from mere centres of transport (discharging and loading of vessels) to logistics centres. Moreover, ports able to add value to the goods passing through the port area, have a major asset in a climate of increasing international competition. These developments are also mentioned in this report, since no Flemish port is an exception to this rule...|$|R
40|$|If some solid bulk cargoes such as concentrates, {{unprocessed}} {{nickel ores}} and iron ore fines contain sufficient moisture, then cargo compaction during a voyage may cause liquefaction. This {{has been known}} to result in major cargo displacement ('cargo shift'), causing the vessel to capsize. This has resulted in a number of fatalities. To provide context to this interdisciplinary problem, an overview of the key considerations is presented, which includes: (i) a summary of the wide range of factors that influence a cargo's likelihood to shift; (ii) the soil mechanics principles {{that can be used to}} explain cargo shift; and (iii) the regulatory controls that are used to prevent its occurrence during <b>shipment.</b> Under the <b>requirements</b> of international maritime regulation, primarily the International Maritime Bulk Solid Cargoes (IMSBC) Code, a cargo that may liquefy must be shipped below a threshold moisture content, the 'Transportable Moisture Limit' (TML) —as determined from one of three laboratory test methods specified within the IMSBC Code. However, there are recognised problems with these tests, namely that for any given sample tested: (i) the tests give variable TML results, particularly when conducted in different laboratories; and (ii) each of the three test methods give a different TML result. As the TML determines a cargo's transportability, these issues have commercial and safety implications. To address these issues for the two most popular test methods, the Flow Table Test (FTT) and Proctor/Fagerberg Test (PFT), tests were performed on sand and iron ore fines. For each test, major sources of variability were identified, along with issues inherent in the test methodology. From these findings, a number of recommendations and several modifications have been proposed that, if implemented within the IMSBC Code, will improve the tests' reliability. The results were then compared to establish whether the different TML results obtained from the two test methods could be aligned—this showed that calibration between the methods was not possible on the basis of their TML. The test method assessment also incorporated observations at TML test facilities, interviews with leading researchers and an assessment of archive research material. Whilst the findings related to variability will help improve the reliability of the TML test methods, the accuracy of these methods is still not understood (i. e. how well do they indicate the likelihood for an actual cargo to liquefy?). This thesis therefore gives consideration to the likely accuracy of the TML test methods. It presents an improved representation of the cargo shift problem, with a view of providing future researchers with a basis to further assess this accuracy and thus the suitability of the TML as a criteria to detect cargoes which may liquefy. This thesis is not currently available in OR...|$|R
40|$|Goodbye import duties. Farewell quotas. Hello rules. Trade in {{agricultural}} products from ACP countries {{now has to}} comply with complex new rules, often about quality. We look at how to jump the latest barriers. With world trade now liberalised under the World Trade Organisation, there are new opportunities and challenges for ACP agricultural exporters. The rapid removal of import levies, duties and fixed import quotas for certain products in the industrialised world means that exporters have {{to compete in the}} market place. For this, they need information about the size and accessibility of the market, and the requirements and regulations about quality and packaging. Fortunately there are several information services covering the requirements of importing countries with regard to: Logistical requirements : volumes and sizes of <b>shipments,</b> packaging <b>requirements,</b> shipping and transit storage, health and hygiene standards, and quality control Market intelligence : how to research the market in a country or region, how to contact and develop relationships with importers Finance: how to organise finance and credit while waiting for payment, including export guarantees. In addition to trade offices in the embassies of importing countries, and export finance information at national chambers of commerce, you can contact any of these international and regional bodies. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) exists to promote world trade, to the benefit of developing countries. Their 'Tradepoint' network, contactable through the UNCTAD's head office, has national offices in many countries with broad-ranging information services. The World Trade Organisation (WTO), although it is often host to uncertainty and controversy at the political level (such as on agricultural products, which it will debate in December 1999), has extensive and helpful advisory services for exporters. Linked to the WTO is the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures Agreement (SPS) applied in cooperation with other international bodies, principally the FAO. The SPS seeks to ensure common standards for food safety and animal and plant health. Large markets The world's largest market for agricultural products is the United States of America, and its import requirements are well-documented by the American Association of Exporters & Importers (AAEI). The second largest market is the European Union, whose fifteen Member States apply common import rules. The fact that it is called a 'single market' hides the fact that the Union contains a great variety of markets, with different consumer tastes and demands. The Centre for the Promotion of Imports from developing countries (CBI) advises both exporters, and European importers. It provides market information, matching programmes, promotion advice in marketing, market surveys, trade documentation, and a far-sighted service on the health, social and environmental demands of the market. It also provides connections to import bodies in each EU member state. Many ACP agricultural exports to Europe are in horticulture, a sector well-promoted by COLEACP, an interprofessional association of exporters, importers and other operators from the ACP-EU industry. COLEACP is {{regarded as one of the}} success stories in ACP-EU cooperation, with many satisfied clients in the promotion of competitive ACP exports of fresh fruit and vegetables, flowers and ornamental plants. It may not last for ever World trade will increasingly be subject to concerns, and perhaps rules, regarding social and environmental issues and a wise exporter will do well to anticipate them. These issues include consumer demand for guarantees about the method of production (such as organic agriculture, absence of child labour, and profit-sharing schemes, often collectively described as 'Fair Trade'), and international demand to reduce energy use in the packaging and shipment of produce, particularly over long distances. Already in Europe there are steps to reduce imports of non-essential products, such as bananas in Norway. And many food packaging plants in ACP countries use heavy materials and technologies that are no longer accepted in the North because of their energy waste. You might think that the world is entering a period of free and frenetic trade. Maybe, but it may not last for long. Several global governance bodies are already preparing for a new wave of restrictions on environmental and energy grounds. A hub in this movement is the United Nations Department for Sustainable Development which can keep you informed, and ahead of most exporters, of forthcoming trends. In the meantime, be informed and trade away. If the big organisations cannot help you promptly and to the extent you want, try this surprising source. The most comprehensive and accessible collection of contact details of import and export agencies all over the world is in the small but enterprising state of El Salvador, in Central America. The Electronic System for Foreign Trade has a trade information service in English and Spanish, open to anybody, by mail or electronic mail.
