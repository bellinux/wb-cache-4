40|$|The {{traffic carried}} by common channel {{signalling}} (CCS) networks is continually increasing. This, coupled with increasing complexity in services and customer profiles, results in potentially volatile traffic, {{and can lead to}} overload in various components of the CCS network. This paper investigates the dynamics of the national option with congestion priorities (NOCP) and international option (IO) congestion control strategies, when they are implemented in a CCS network during a period of <b>signalling</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>point</b> (STP) processor overload. In addition, we study the success of a combined control (CC) which incorporates both the NOCP and IO. We find (1) IO performs well under all the situations studied, and (2) the NOCP performs well in most cases, but is sensitive to the setting of congestion thresholds.

50|$|A <b>Signal</b> <b>Transfer</b> <b>Point</b> (STP) is {{a router}} that relays SS7 {{messages}} between signaling end-points (SEPs) and other <b>signaling</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>points</b> (STPs). Typical SEPs include service switching points (SSPs) and service control points (SCPs). The STP {{is connected to}} adjacent SEPs and STPs via signaling links. Based on the address fields of the SS7 messages, the STP routes the messages to the appropriate outgoing signaling link. Edge STPs can also route based upon message body content using deep packet inspection techniques, and can provide address translations and screen content to limit the transfer of messages with dubious content or sent from unreliable sources. To meet stringent reliability requirements, STPs are typically provisioned in mated pairs.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} {{the results of a}} computational study towards the (re) optimization of <b>signaling</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>points</b> (STPs) in telecommunication networks. The best performance of an STP is achieved whenever the traffic load is evenly distributed among the internal components. Due to the continuously changing traffic pattern, the load of the components has to be re-optimized on a regular basis. Besides the balancing objective also the number of rearrangements have to be taken into account. In this paper we present two alternative formulations to deal with both requirements.

50|$|MTP3 {{provides}} routing functionality {{to transport}} signaling messages through the SS7 network to the requested endpoint. Each network {{element in the}} SS7 network has a unique address, the Point Code (PC). Message routing is performed according to this address. A distinction is made between a <b>Signaling</b> <b>Transfer</b> <b>Point</b> (STP) which only performs MTP message routing functionalities and a Signaling End Point (SEP) which uses MTP to communicate with other SEPs (that is, telecom switches). MTP3 is also responsible for network management; when the availability of MTP2 data links changes. MTP3 establishes alternative links and re-routes traffic away from failed links and signaling points and propagates information about route availability through the network. Also controls traffic when congestion occurs.|$|R
40|$|Signalling System 7 (SS 7) {{is widely}} used for {{telephone}} signalling. Service providers need to frequently test their <b>Signalling</b> <b>Transfer</b> <b>Points</b> (STPs), which switch SS 7 messages, for both protocol conformance and interoperability. This paper describes a system that automatically analyzes the data collected during STP tests. It consists of files that describe how the STPs are expected to behave during the test, and Perl code that translates this Expected Behavior into a program that can search the data collected during the test for the expected events, and report on whether the system passed the test. The system readily processed over 30, 000 events for each test run, and identified abnormal behavior that could interfere with interoperability and protocol conformance...|$|R
50|$|When a {{toll-free}} number is dialed, each digit is analyzed and processed by the LEC. The toll-free call {{is identified as}} such by the service switching point (SSP). The SSP is responsible for sending call information to the service control point (SCP), routing the request through at least one <b>signal</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>point</b> (STP) in the Signalling System 7 (SS7) network. SS7 is a digital out-of-band method of transmitting signalling (call control) information in the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). The SS7 network is a packet-switched network carrying signaling data (setup and tear down of the call and services) separate from the circuit-switched bearer network (the payload of the telephone call) in the AIN services network. The SSP asks the SCP where to send the call.|$|R
50|$|In World Area 1 (corresponding to North America) ANSI SCCP is in use. In this case, due to North American standards, the routing of {{mobility}} related messages {{must be done}} with the E.212 number directly. This has the advantage that in it is easier to identify to which country messages should be routed based on the mobile country code. The design of the North American Number Plan means {{that there is not a}} separate country code for each country in North America. Working with E.214 numbers would not be an insurmountable challenge, as can be seen from the fact that routing of phone calls using E.164 numbers is normal, but it would mean adding full E.164 routing tables to <b>signalling</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>points</b> where it has never been needed before.|$|R
40|$|Introduction This Recommendation {{describes}} aspects {{which are}} pertinent to {{and should be}} considered in the design of international signalling networks. Some or all of these aspects may also be relevant to the design of national networks. Some aspects are dealt with for both international and national networks (e. g. availability), others are discussed {{in the context of the}} international network only (e. g. number of <b>signalling</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>points</b> in a <b>signalling</b> relation). A number of aspects require further study for national networks. This Recommendation also gives in Annex A examples of how the signalling network procedures may be applied to the mesh network representation. The national and international networks are considered to be structurally independent and, although a particular signalling point may belong to both networks, signalling points are allocated signalling point codes according to the rules of each network.

40|$|Signaling {{is crucial}} to the {{operation}} of modern telecommunication networks. A breakdown in the signaling infrastructure typically causes customer service failures, incurs revenue losses, and hampers the company image. Therefore, the signaling network has to be highest reliability and survivability. This in particular holds for the routers in such a network, called <b>signaling</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>points</b> (STPs). The robustness of an STP can be improved by equally distributing the load over the internal processing units. Several constraints have to be taken into account. The load of the links connected to a processing unit changes over time introducing an imbalance of the load. In this paper, we show how integer linear programming can be applied to reduce the imbalance within an STP, while keeping the number of changes small. Two alternative models are presented. Computational experiments validate the integer programming approach in practice. The GSM network operator E-Plus saves substantial amounts of time and money by employing the proposed approach...|$|R
40|$|SS 7 or Signaling System Number 7 {{is a set}} of {{protocols}} {{that describes}} a means of communication between telephone switches in public telephone networks. SS 7 is a highly sophisticated and powerful form of Common Channel Signaling (CCS). The use of out-of-band signaling procedures offers considerable benefits over and above other signaling methodologies. The primary function of SS 7 is to provide call control, remote network management, and maintenance capabilities for the inter- office telephone network. SS 7 performs these functions by exchanging control messages between SS 7 telephone exchanges (signaling points or SPs) and SS 7 <b>signaling</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>points</b> (STPs). The switching offices (SPs) handle the SS 7 control network as well as the user circuit switched network. Basically, the SS 7 control network tells the switching office which paths to establish over the circuit-switched network. The STPs route SS 7 control packets across the signaling network. A switching office {{may or may not be}} an STP...|$|R
5000|$|Providers use SS7 {{to route}} calls {{throughout}} the US/Canada network. SS7 accesses databases for various {{services such as}} CNAM, LIDB, Custom Local Area Signaling Services (CLASS) and LNP. Calls to ported numbers are completed when a customer who calls a ported number sends the dialed number to a provider's SSP (Service Switch Point), where it is identified either as a local call or not. If the call is local, the switch has the NPA-NXX in its routing table as portable, so it sends a routing request to the <b>Signal</b> <b>Transfer</b> <b>Point</b> (STP) which accesses a local database that is updated by an LSMS (Local Service Management System) which holds all routing for all ported numbers to which the carrier is responsible for completing calls. If routing information is found, a response {{is sent to the}} [...] "query" [...] containing the information necessary to properly route the call. If it is not a local number, the call is passed on to the STP and routed until it gets to a local carrier who will perform the [...] "query" [...] mentioned earlier and route the call accordingly.|$|R
50|$|If a {{short-circuited}} or open-circuited {{transmission line}} is wired {{in parallel with}} a line used to <b>transfer</b> <b>signals</b> from <b>point</b> A to point B, then it will function as a filter. The method for making stubs {{is similar to the}} method for using Lecher lines for crude frequency measurement, but it is 'working backwards'. One method recommended in the RSGB's radiocommunication handbook is to take an open-circuited length of transmission line wired in parallel with the feeder delivering signals from an aerial. By cutting the free end of the transmission line, a minimum in the strength of the signal observed at a receiver can be found. At this stage the stub filter will reject this frequency and the odd harmonics, but if the free end of the stub is shorted then the stub will become a filter rejecting the even harmonics.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} rod-bipolar <b>signal</b> <b>transfer</b> on visual sensitivity. Two observations indicate that rod-rod bipolar <b>signal</b> <b>transfer</b> is nonlinear. First, responses of rods increased linearly with flash strength, while those of rod bipolars increased supralinearly. Second, fluctuations in the responses of rod bipolars were larger than expected from linear summation of the rod inputs. Rod-OFF bipolar <b>signal</b> <b>transfer</b> did not share this strong nonlinearity. Surprisingly, nonlinear rod-rod bipolar <b>signal</b> <b>transfer</b> eliminated many of the rod’s single-photon responses. The impact on sensitivity, however, was more than compensated for by rejection of noise from rods that did not absorb photons. As a consequence, rod bipolars provide a nearoptimal readout of rod signals at light levels near visual threshold...|$|R

40|$|Among the <b>signal</b> <b>transfer</b> {{systems in}} {{bacteria}} two types predominate: two-component regulatory systems and quorum sensing systems. Both types of system can mediate <b>signal</b> <b>transfer</b> across the bacterial cell envelope; however, the signalling molecule typically is {{not taken up}} into the cells in the former type of system, whereas it usually is in the latter. The Two-component systems include the recently described (eukaryotic) phosphorelay systems; quorum sensing systems can be based upon autoinducers of the N-acylated homoserine lactones, and on autoinducers of a peptidic nature. A single bacterial cell contains many signalling modules that primarily operate in parallel. This may give rise to neural-network behaviour. Recently, however, for both types of basic <b>signal</b> <b>transfer</b> modules, it has been demonstrated that they also can be organised in series (i. e. in a hierarchical order). Besides their hierarchical position in the signal transduction network of the cell, the spatial distribution of individual signalling modules may also {{be an important factor}} in their efficiency in <b>signal</b> <b>transfer.</b> Many challenges lie hidden in future work to understand these <b>signal</b> <b>transfer</b> processes in more detail. These are discussed here, with emphasis on the mutual interactions between different <b>signal</b> <b>transfer</b> processes. Successful contributions to this work will require rigorous mathematical modelling of the performance of signal transduction components, and -networks, as well as studies on light-sensing signal transduction systems, because of the unsurpassed time resolution obtainable in those latter systems, the opportunity to apply repeated reproducible stimuli, etc. The increased understanding of bacterial behaviour that already has resulted - and may further result - from these studies, can be used to fine-tune the beneficial activities of bacteria and/or more efficiently inhibit their deleterious ones...|$|R
