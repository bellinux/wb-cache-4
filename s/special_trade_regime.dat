40|$|International {{trade in}} {{textiles}} and clothing has been subject to strong protectionism for decades. Although the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing has set procedures to phase out the quota system, this paper questions how far the regime will actually be liberalized. It highlights the {{significant differences between the}} China-specific safeguard provisions in China’s WTO accession protocol and the general WTO Agreement on Safeguards. It also examines the recent case of a US safeguard application against China’s textile and clothing products and analyses the potential impact of this case on both countries and the global economy. The analysis suggests that prospects for China’s textile and clothing exports after WTO accession may not be as optimistic as is generally assumed. For decades, the world’s textile and clothing market has been subject to a <b>special</b> <b>trade</b> <b>regime</b> under the Multifibre Arrangement (MFA), a construct that is in conflict with the core principles of the World Trade Organization (WTO), such as non-discrimination and transparency. For about 30 years, rich countries have so protected their domestic textile industries from cheaper imports originating in poorer nations. Not until January 1995 did the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) come into force, which attempted to reverse decades of protection in these sectors. The ATC sets out the framework and procedures to phase out the MFA and eliminate the entire quota system eventually by 2005. This should have a huge positive impact on developing countries, which have been restricted on exporting their textile products {{for an extended period of}} time. China, as the largest textile and clothin...|$|E

40|$|Although it is {{well-known}} that a global <b>trade</b> <b>regime</b> best ensures economic welfare, there has nevertheless been {{a proliferation of}} free trade agreements (FTAs) between individual countries. This poses the challenge known as the "noodle bowl effect" - stemming from different rules of origins and technical standards. In this paper, we explore an economy's incentive for entering an FTA rather than anticipating a global <b>trade</b> <b>regime.</b> Using basic game theories, we show {{that in order for}} an equilibrium number of FTA participants to be obtained, the negative impact of FTAs should be significant. Globally, the side effects of FTAs centered on noodle bowl effects could contribute to inducing a global free <b>trade</b> <b>regime</b> - and also increase the viability of such regime once established. Ironically, then we need to encourage more FTAs across countries to facilitate the spread of greater noodle bowl effects instead of trying to curb the rush to FTAs to promote a global <b>trade</b> <b>regime...</b>|$|R

An Intermediate Methodology for Comparative Analysis of Trade Policies. Uganda’s <b>trade</b> <b>regime</b> was more open in 2001 than in 1997, as during these intervening years Uganda has made considerable progress {{in providing a}} level playing field for the tradable sector. On the import side, lower maximum and average tariffs had significantly reduced the level of protection in 2001. On the export side, absence of export taxes and an effectively functioning VAT reimbursement scheme for exporters had sharply reduced the disincentives for exporting. By 2001, Uganda had also initiated policy changes for enhancing the efficiency and transparency of its <b>trade</b> <b>regime</b> through customs administration policy changes, duty-drawback schemes and policies aimed at reducing the scope for scope for administrative discretion in granting tariff exemptions. Due to these sustained policy changes, the overall anti-export bias of Uganda’s <b>trade</b> <b>regime</b> was significantly lower in 2001 than in 1997. On the other hand, Uganda has used discriminatory excise taxes to raise the level of effective protection accorded to certain domestic industries.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the effects of competing <b>trade</b> <b>regimes</b> on Serbian <b>trade</b> with its most significant (traditional) partners, like European Union and CEFTA 2006 signatories, and other untraditional trade partners with favourable <b>trade</b> <b>regime,</b> like the USA. To this end, gravity model with bilateral and time effects is estimated by Hausman-Taylor AR(1) instrumental variable estimator, using panel data on bilateral trade between Serbia and its main trade partners during the period 2001 - 2010. The results indicate that overall level of development and difference in factor endowments stimulate Serbia’s exports, which is in accordance with theoretical foundation that inter-industry trade is predominant in exports of less developed countries. Moreover, competing <b>trade</b> <b>regimes</b> appear as important determinant of Serbia’s trade relations, whereas additional liberalization of <b>trade</b> <b>regime</b> with the USA as untraditional trade partner, even asymmetrical to Serbia’s favour, cannot divert trade flows from traditional partners in the long-run.

The result could be due to the contemporaneous effects of trade preferences granted to Serbia by the EU and other CEFTA 2006 signatories, main trading partners of Serbia...|$|R

40|$|The {{fragmentation}} and dispersion of productive {{activities and the}} emergence of global production networks (GPNs) as key organisational structures for managing production and trade at a global scale has received growing attention over the past two decades. The role of trade policy and preferential <b>trade</b> <b>regimes</b> in shaping these production networks has been documented in this literature. Our understanding of the relationship between GPNs and <b>trade</b> <b>regimes</b> remains, however, underdeveloped. By examining the case of a trade agreement implemented in Egypt and Jordan as part of the "Middle East Peace Process", this paper highlights how the shifts in global production networks and key actors within these networks were key drivers of this agreement. It also shows how the interaction between GPN dynamics and actors, the configurations of the <b>trade</b> <b>regime,</b> and the distinct locational and regulatory factors in the two countries led to production and trade outcomes that differed from the original objectives of the trade agreement. Through this case, the paper shows that more theoretical and empirical research is needed to unpack the interaction between <b>trade</b> <b>regimes</b> and global production networks {{at the level of the}} political economy of these <b>trade</b> <b>regimes</b> and also on how the specific requirements of these regimes interact with GPN dynamics to produce distinct geographies of global flows,production, employment, and development...|$|R
40|$|The Evolution of the <b>Trade</b> <b>Regime</b> {{offers a}} {{comprehensive}} political-economic {{history of the}} development of the world's multilateral trade institutions, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and its successor, the World Trade Organization (WTO). While other books confine themselves to describing contemporary GATT/WTO legal rules or analyzing their economic logic, this is the first to explain the logic and development behind these rules. The book begins by examining the institutions' rules, principles, practices, and norms from their genesis in the early postwar period to the present. It evaluates the extent to which changes in these institutional attributes have helped maintain or rebuild domestic constituencies for open markets. The book considers these questions by looking at the political, legal, and economic foundations of the <b>trade</b> <b>regime</b> from many angles. The authors conclude that throughout most of GATT/WTO history, power politics fundamentally shaped the creation and evolution of the GATT/WTO system. Yet in recent years, many aspects of the <b>trade</b> <b>regime</b> have failed to keep pace with shifts in underlying material interests and ideas, and the challenges presented by expanding membership and preferential <b>trade</b> agreements. <b>trade</b> <b>regime,</b> <b>trade</b> agreements, politics, law, GATT, WTO, markets...|$|R

40|$|This note evaluates Senegal’s <b>trade</b> <b>regime</b> in 2001 and UEMOA’s common {{external}} trade policies, using the methodology developed in Hinkle et al (2003). We {{find that the}} <b>trade</b> <b>regime</b> was reasonably open. Its exchange regime and the avoidance of NTB were international good practice. Senegal was also quite advanced {{in terms of the}} average import duties as well as the reimbursement of VAT to exporters. On the other hand, it used surcharges, exemptions, and other policies selectively to elevate the protection accorded to certain industries. It also failed to provide access to duty-free inputs to exporters, which exacerbated the anti-export bias of the <b>trade</b> <b>regime.</b> Despite the remaining weaknesses, however, Senegal’s <b>trade</b> <b>regime</b> in 2001 was the most open among the African countries to which the methodology developed by Hinkle et al has been applied to date (although some countries that were evaluated previously have subsequently implemented reforms).

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study the {{contemporary}} world <b>trade</b> <b>regime</b> as part of the process of globalization. The main question in this study is: "How is the contemporary world <b>trade</b> <b>regime</b> part of the process of globalization?" Three guiding questions in this study are: "Which shifts in governance and policy on world trade issues can be observed since the middle of the twentieth century?" "How are the shifts in governance and policy related to each other?" "Which interests benefit and which interests don't benefit from the contemporary world trade regime?" This study is an analysis of world trade governance and policy that will outline the historical developments and the impact of the process of globalization. The study is mainly based on literature, sometimes internet sources are used. The conclusions of this study are that the world <b>trade</b> <b>regime</b> has shifted from unilateral and bilateral regulation towards multilateral governance by the GATT and subsequent the WTO agreements as well as by the regional trade agreements. Policy has shifted from protectionism towards liberalized trade. The shift in governance has provided trust and stability in the interstate system and has made liberalized trade possible. The study has made clear that theories on world politics differ about the benefits of the world <b>trade</b> <b>regime.</b> Both world <b>trade</b> and the process of globalization make self-sufficiency for countries obsolete by creating extensive interdependence between states and people.

40|$|Abstract: This chapter aims {{to further}} the debate {{regarding}} the role of law for establishing an adequate enforcement strategy for an emissions trading scheme. We focus on sanction regimes within the EU ETS and the Chinese emissions trading pilot projects. Section 2 sets the scene by pointing at the need of an adequate enforcement approach and related legal scholarship. Section three presents the specific case of the EU ETS, established with Directive 2003 / 87 /EC from 2003, while section 4 turns to the recently developed greenhouse gas emissions trading pilot projects in China. Particularly the sections 3 and 4 focus on sanctions for excess emissions, thereby discussing recent case law regarding penalties for emissions trading within the EU and specific enforcement approaches in the emerging emissions <b>trading</b> <b>regimes</b> in China. Section 5 concludes, thereby highlighting that proper evaluations of compliance with emissions <b>trading</b> <b>regimes,</b> is a challenge in itself, not only for governments, but also for academics who want to gain further insights into how emissions <b>trading</b> <b>regimes</b> work {{in the practice of}} different legal systems.
