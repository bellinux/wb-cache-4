25|$|During 2000–2010, the Virginia League of Conservation Voters gave Hurt {{an average}} {{approval}} rating of 40%. However, in 2010, when Hurt was running against incumbent Tom Perriello, the Sierra Club and League of Conservation Voters released {{television and radio}} ads against Hurt, attacking him on an alleged conflict of interest regarding uranium mining. However, the ads were deemed to be false by independent fact checkers {{due to the fact}} Robert Hurt had no personal investment in uranium mining. Hurt strongly opposed House <b>Speaker</b> <b>Nancy</b> <b>Pelosi’s</b> 2009 proposed “Cap-and Trade” climate control legislation. Hurt called on the Virginia Department of Interior secretary Ken Salazar to remove bans on off-shore drilling and development.|$|R
25|$|On March 30, 2010 Obama {{signed the}} Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, 7 {{days after he}} had signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act into law. At the end of 2009, each house of Congress passed its own health care reform bill, but neither house passed the other bill. The Senate bill, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, became the most viable avenue to reform {{following}} the death of Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy and his replacement by Republican Scott Brown. Lacking a filibuster-proof super-majority in the Senate, the Obama administration and House <b>Speaker</b> <b>Nancy</b> <b>Pelosi</b> began encouraging the House to pass the Senate bill, then pass a new bill to amend it using the reconciliation process.|$|E
25|$|As the longest-serving Democratic senator, Byrd {{served as}} President pro tempore four times when his party {{was in the}} majority: from 1989 until the Republicans won control of the Senate in 1995; for 17 days in early 2001, when the Senate was evenly split between parties and {{outgoing}} Vice President Al Gore broke the tie {{in favor of the}} Democrats; when the Democrats regained the majority in June 2001 after Senator Jim Jeffords of Vermont left the Republican Party to become an independent; and again from 2007 to his death in 2010, {{as a result of the}} 2006 Senate elections. In this capacity, Byrd was third in the line of presidential succession at the time of his death, behind Vice President Joe Biden and House <b>Speaker</b> <b>Nancy</b> <b>Pelosi.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{the race}} {{continued}} to Pennsylvania, Indiana, and North Carolina, many observers concluded that Clinton had little chance to overcome Obama's lead in pledged delegates. Even {{if she were}} to succeed in changing the dynamics of the race, there would not be enough pledged delegates remaining for her to catch up under most realistic scenarios. Some analysts believed Clinton could still win the nomination by raising doubts about Obama's electability, fighting for Michigan and Florida delegates to be seated at the convention, and convincing superdelegates to support her despite her expected loss in the pledged delegate vote. However, the window of opportunity for re-votes in Michigan and Florida appeared to close in late March, and House <b>Speaker</b> <b>Nancy</b> <b>Pelosi,</b> chairwoman of the Democratic National Convention, said that it would be harmful to the party if superdelegates were to overturn the result of the pledged delegate vote.|$|E
5|$|C-SPAN {{continues}} to expand its coverage of government proceedings, {{with a history of}} requests to government officials for greater access, especially to the U.S. Supreme Court. In December 2009, Lamb wrote to leaders in the House and Senate, requesting that negotiations for health care reform be televised by C-SPAN. Committee meetings on health care were broadcast subsequently by C-SPAN and may be viewed on the C-SPAN website. In November 2010, Lamb wrote to incoming House Speaker John Boehner requesting changes to restrictions on cameras in the House. In particular, C-SPAN asked to add some of its own robotically operated cameras to the existing government-controlled cameras in the House chamber. In February 2011, Boehner denied the request. A previous request to <b>Speaker</b> Designate <b>Nancy</b> <b>Pelosi</b> in 2006, to add C-SPAN's cameras in the House chamber to record floor proceedings, was also denied. Although C-SPAN uses the congressional chamber feed cables, the cameras are owned and controlled by each respective body of Congress. Requests by C-SPAN for camera access to non-government events such as the annual dinner by the Gridiron Club have also been denied.|$|R

In 2013, Gravel expressed disdain for President Obama, calling him a [...] "a total fraud" [...] and saying that both Bush and Obama should be tried [...] "for the crimes and murders they've committed" [...] in the International Court of Justice. Gravel specifically condemned Obama for the drone strikes in Pakistan and elsewhere.|$|E
500|$|Bush's {{approval}} rating went below the 50percent mark in AP-Ipsos polling in December 2004. Thereafter, his {{approval rating}}s and approval of {{his handling of}} {{domestic and foreign policy}} issues steadily dropped. Bush received heavy criticism for his handling of the Iraq War, his response to Hurricane Katrina and to the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse, NSA warrantless surveillance, the Plame affair, and Guantanamo Bay detention camp controversies. There were calls for Bush's impeachment, though most polls showed a plurality of Americans would not support such an action. The arguments offered for impeachment usually centered on the NSA warrantless surveillance controversy, the Bush administration's justification for the war in Iraq, and alleged violations of the Geneva Conventions. Representative Dennis Kucinich (D-OH), who had run against Bush during the 2004 presidential campaign, introduced 35 articles of impeachment {{on the floor of the}} House of Representatives against Bush on June 9, 2008, but <b>Speaker</b> <b>Nancy</b> <b>Pelosi</b> (D-CA) declared that impeachment was [...] "off the table".|$|E

Ron has a poster of Bob Knight, the famous retired basketball coach, hanging in his office. The Bobby Knight image later {{had to be removed}} from the show for legal reasons. Leslie has an autographed photo of Indiana-born basketball player Larry Bird on her desk. It reads, [...] "To Lesly, Sink That Shot, Larry B." [...] This is a reference to a deleted scene in which Tom reveals he has tricked Leslie into believing he has brunch with Bird once a month. Tom himself actually faked the autograph, and deliberately misspelled her name [...] "Lesly" [...] as a joke.|$|E
