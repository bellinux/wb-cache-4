5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{listed the}} pyjama shark as Near Threatened, citing its small {{distribution}} {{and a recent}} increase in fishing pressure on <b>small</b> <b>sharks</b> in the region. However, {{there is no evidence}} to suggest that its population has declined. There are no specific conservation measures in place for this species, though its range encompasses two marine reserves. The South African Sea Fisheries Research Institute is considering legally decommercializing the pyjama shark, which would limit the degree to which it can be targeted by commercial fisheries.|$|E
5|$|Solitary and nocturnal, the Atlantic torpedo {{is capable}} of {{generating}} up to 220volts of electricity to subdue its prey or defend itself against predators. Its diet consists mainly of bony fishes, though it also feeds on <b>small</b> <b>sharks</b> and crustaceans. It is an aplacental viviparous species, wherein the developing embryos are nourished by yolk and later maternally provided histotroph ("uterine milk"). Females give birth to up to 60 young following a gestation period of one year. The electric shock of this species can be quite severe and painful, {{though it is not}} fatal. Because of its electrogenic properties, the Atlantic torpedo was used in medicine by the Ancient Greeks and Romans and became the namesake of the naval weapon. Prior to the 19th century, its liver oil was used as lamp fuel, but it is no longer of any economic value. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Data Deficient; it is caught unintentionally by commercial and recreational fishers, but the impact of these activities on its population is unknown.|$|E
25|$|A mesopredator is a medium-sized, middle {{trophic level}} predator, which both predates and is predated upon. Examples are raccoons, skunks, snakes, cownose rays, and <b>small</b> <b>sharks.</b>|$|E
50|$|They are ovoviviparous, {{with the}} mother {{retaining}} the egg-cases inside her body until they hatch, producing litters up to 24 pups. They feed on <b>smaller</b> <b>sharks,</b> <b>smaller</b> bony fish, and on crabs and cephalopods.|$|R
50|$|The <b>smaller</b> <b>sharks</b> {{seen from}} a {{distance}} were fiberglass structures on hydraulic lifts pulled by a motor of the same structure.|$|R
50|$|The {{tiger shark}} {{had been caught}} 3 {{kilometres}} from the beach suburb of Coogee in mid-April and transferred to the Coogee Aquarium Baths, where it was put on public display. Within a week the fish became ill and vomited {{in front of a}} small crowd, leaving the left forearm of a man bearing a distinctive tattoo floating in the pool. Before it was captured, the tiger shark had devoured a <b>smaller</b> <b>shark.</b> It was this <b>smaller</b> <b>shark</b> that had originally swallowed the human arm.|$|R
25|$|The bull shark's diet {{consists}} {{mainly of}} bony fish and <b>small</b> <b>sharks,</b> including other bull sharks, {{but can also}} include turtles, birds, dolphins, terrestrial mammals, crustaceans, echinoderms, and stingrays. They hunt in murky waters where it is harder for the prey to see the shark coming. Bull sharks {{have been known to}} use the bump-and-bite technique to attack their prey. After the first initial contact, they continue to bite and tackle prey until they are unable to flee.|$|E
25|$|Coelacanths are {{opportunistic}} feeders, hunting cuttlefish, squid, snipe eels, <b>small</b> <b>sharks,</b> {{and other}} fish {{found in their}} deep reef and volcanic slope habitats. Coelacanths are also known to swim head down, backwards or belly up to locate their prey, presumably using their rostral glands. Scientists suspect one reason this fish has been so successful is that specimens are able to slow down their metabolisms at will, sinking into the less-inhabited depths and minimizing their nutritional requirements {{in a sort of}} hibernation mode.|$|E
25|$|In {{the western}} Atlantic, the spiny {{butterfly}} ray feeds on fishes, including Leiognathus and <b>small</b> <b>sharks,</b> and squids. Off Tunisia, they feed on crustaceans, teleosts, cephalopods, lamellibranchs, and gastropods, {{in descending order}} of importance. Teleost fishes apparently become {{more important in the}} ray's diet with increasing size. An active predator, the ray typically approaches a prey item slowly before rapidly spinning around over it and striking the food with the leading edge of one of their pectoral fins. This behavior likely serves to stun the prey before capture, as the pectoral fins of butterfly rays contain a high proportion of red muscle and can deliver blows of substantial force.|$|E
50|$|Several {{species of}} sharks {{are kept in}} captivity in public aquaria. In home aquaria, size {{constraints}} mean that only the <b>smallest</b> <b>sharks</b> are typically viable as pets.|$|R
50|$|In Game 2 of the 2009-10 Western Conference Semifinals {{between the}} Detroit Red Wings and San Jose <b>Sharks,</b> a <b>small</b> <b>shark</b> was tossed {{onto the ice}} with an octopus inside its mouth.|$|R
50|$|The lizard {{catshark}}, Schroederichthys saurisqualus, is a <b>small</b> <b>shark</b> {{species of}} the catshark family, Scyliorhinidae, found {{off the coast of}} southern Brazil on the upper continental shelf at depths of between 250 and 500 m.|$|R
25|$|The borough is {{also home}} to Mexico City and Mexico’s largest fish market, called La Nueva Viga, in Colonia San José Aculco on Prologación Eje 6 Sur. With 202 {{wholesalers}} and 165 retail outlets, it distributes about 60% of the country’s seafood production along with much of what is imported. The market begins business at 4:00a.m., when delivery trucks bring in fresh fish from all over Mexico to the vendors. This daily delivery is about 500 tons and includes all kinds of seafood from shrimp to fish to shellfish to <b>small</b> <b>sharks</b> and manta rays. The main fish market is here due to Mexico City’s role as economic center since the pre Hispanic period.|$|E
25|$|Although {{porpoising}} is {{a useful}} product of rapid swimming, a lot of variation seen in the behaviour cannot be explained by this cause alone; it has likely evolved to provide other functions. For example, the rotation during porpoising by the spinner dolphin leads to lots of splashing and is more common at slower speeds so cannot be attributed to an energy saving mechanism. It is therefore {{more likely to be}} a form of play or communication within or between pods. Another reason might be to remove barnacles or <b>small</b> <b>sharks</b> such as remoras that, when attached, increase drag during swimming. When spinner dolphins impact the water the combination of centrifugal and vertical force upon these ectoparasites can be up to 700 times their own weight and so efficiently remove them. Other theories suggest that cetaceans may porpoise in order to observe distant objects such as food by looking for visual cues, such as birds dive-bombing a bait ball. Research into the additional functions of porpoising has so far been focussed on the more acrobatic species, but it is likely that other cetaceans also use it for these, and perhaps unknown, reasons too.|$|E
25|$|Large animals {{taken by}} adult {{crocodiles}} include sambar deer (Rusa unicolor), wild boar (Sus scrofa), Malayan tapirs (Tapirus indicus), kangaroos, humans, orangutans (Pongo ssp.), dingos (Canis lupus dingo), tigers (Panthera tigris), and large bovines, such as banteng (Bos javanicus), water buffalo (Bubalus arnee), and gaur (Bos gaurus). However, larger animals are taken only sporadically {{due to the}} fact only large males typically attack very large prey and large ungulates and other sizeable wild mammals are only sparsely distributed in this species' range, outside of a few key areas such as the Sundarbans. Off-setting this, goats, water buffalo and wild boar/pigs have been introduced to many of the areas occupied by saltwater crocodiles and returned to feral states to varying degrees and thus can amply support large crocodiles. Any type of domestic livestock, such as chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus), sheep (Ovis aries), pigs, horses (Equus ferus caballus) and cattle (Bos primigenius taurus), and domesticated animals/pets may be eaten if given the opportunity. As a seagoing species, the saltwater crocodile also preys on a variety of saltwater bony fish and other marine animals, including sea snakes, sea turtles, sea birds, dugongs (Dugong dugon), rays (including large sawfish), and <b>small</b> <b>sharks.</b> Most witnessed acts of predation on marine animals have occurred in coastal waters or within sight of land, with female sea turtles and their babies caught during mating season when the turtles are closer to shore and bull sharks being the only largish shark with a strong propensity to patrol brackish and fresh waters. However, there is evidence that saltwater crocodiles do hunt while out in the open seas, based upon the remains of pelagic fishes that dwell only miles away from land being found in their stomachs.|$|E
50|$|USS Sea Dog (SS-401/AGSS-401) was a Balao-class {{submarine}} in the United States Navy. She was {{the first}} ship to be named for the dogfish, a <b>small</b> <b>shark</b> of the North Atlantic, considered destructive by fishermen.|$|R

This facility includes hyacinth macaws, a touch tank of <b>small</b> <b>sharks</b> and rays, and a butterfly garden with free-flying South American species.|$|E
500|$|As generalist predators, velvet bellies feed on {{crustaceans}} (e.g. pasiphaeid {{shrimp and}} krill), cephalopods (e.g. ommastrephid squid and sepiolids), and bony fishes (e.g. shads, barracudinas, lanternfishes, and pouts). Sharks off Italy also eat {{small amounts of}} nematodes, polychaete worms, and other cartilaginous fishes. Studies of velvet bellies off Norway and Portugal, and in the Rockall Trough, have found <b>small</b> <b>sharks</b> under [...] long feed mainly on the krill Meganyctiphanes norvegica and the small fish Maurolicus muelleri. As the sharks grow larger, their diets become more varied, consisting mainly of squid and the shrimp Pasiphaea tarda, as well fishes other than M. muelleri. It has been speculated that smaller velvet bellies may be too slow to catch fast-moving cephalopods. The cephalopod diet of adults overlaps {{with that of the}} Portuguese dogfish; the latter species may avoid competition with the velvet belly by living in deeper water. The bite force exerted by the velvet belly is only around 1 N.|$|E
500|$|The bobcat hunts {{animals of}} {{different}} sizes, and adjusts its hunting techniques accordingly. With small animals, such as rodents (including squirrels), birds, fish including <b>small</b> <b>sharks,</b> and insects, it hunts in areas {{known to be}} abundant in prey, and will lie, crouch, or stand, and wait for victims to wander close. It then pounces, grabbing its prey with its sharp, retractable claws. For slightly larger animals, such as geese, rabbits, and hares, it stalks from cover and waits until prey comes within [...] before rushing in to attack. Less commonly, it feeds on larger animals, such as young ungulates, and other carnivores, such as fishers (primarily female), foxes, minks, skunks, small dogs, and domesticated cats. Bobcats are considered the major predatory threat to the endangered whooping crane. Bobcats are also occasional hunters of livestock and poultry. While larger species, such as cattle and horses, are not known to be attacked, bobcats do present a threat to smaller ruminants, such as sheep and goats. According to the National Agricultural Statistics Service, bobcats killed 11,100 sheep in 2004, comprising 4.9% of all sheep predator deaths. However, some amount of bobcat predation may be misidentified, as bobcats {{have been known to}} scavenge on the remains of livestock kills by other animals.|$|E
50|$|The {{bonnethead}} is {{an abundant}} species {{and is currently}} classified as a least-concern species by the IUCN. It is heavily targeted by commercial and recreational fisheries, and constitutes up to 50% of all <b>small</b> <b>shark</b> landings in the Eastern US.|$|R
5000|$|The only species {{known in}} any detail, P. anglicus was a fish about 25 cm long. [...] Like other acanthodians it had <b>small,</b> <b>shark</b> like scales, and {{a suite of}} fin-spines in front of its dorsal, pectoral, and pelvic fins.|$|R
50|$|Falcatidae is {{a family}} of {{paleozoic}} ratfish. Members of this Family include Falcatus, a <b>small</b> <b>shark</b> from the Bear Gulch Limestone of Montana.

500|$|It is {{estimated}} that 100 million sharks are killed by people every year, due to commercial and recreational fishing. Shark finning yields are estimated at 1.44 million metric tons for 2000, and 1.41 million tons for 2010. Based on an analysis of average shark weights, this translates into a total annual mortality estimate of about 100 million sharks in 2000, and about 97 million sharks in 2010, with a total range of possible values between 63 and 273 million sharks per year. Sharks are a common seafood in many places, including Japan and Australia. In the Australian state of Victoria, shark is {{the most commonly used}} fish in fish and chips, [...] in which fillets are battered and deep-fried or crumbed and grilled. In fish and chip shops, shark is called flake. In India, <b>small</b> <b>sharks</b> or baby sharks (called sora in Tamil language, Telugu language) are sold in local markets. Since the flesh is not developed, cooking the flesh breaks it into powder, which is then fried in oil and spices (called sora puttu/sora poratu). The soft bones can be easily chewed. They are considered a delicacy in coastal Tamil Nadu. Icelanders ferment Greenland sharks to produce hákarl, which is widely regarded as a national dish. During a four-year period from 1996 to 2000, an estimated 26 to 73 million sharks were killed and traded annually in commercial markets.|$|E
500|$|Inquisitive and persistent, the Galapagos shark is {{regarded}} as potentially dangerous to humans. However, several live-aboard boats take divers to Wolf and Darwin, the northernmost Galapagos islands, every week specifically to dive in open water with these sharks where they and the scalloped hammerheads accumulate in numbers, and no incidents have been reported. They are known to approach close to swimmers, showing interest in swim fins or hands, and are drawn in large numbers by fishing activities. Fitzroy (1839) observed off St. Paul's Rocks that [...] "as soon as a fish was caught, a rush of voracious sharks was made at him, notwithstanding blows of oars and boat hooks, the ravenous monsters could not be deterred from seizing and taking away {{more than half the}} fish that were hooked". Limbaugh (1963) reported that at Clipperton Island [...] "at first, the <b>small</b> <b>sharks</b> circled at a distance, but gradually they approached and became more aggressive ... various popular methods for repelling sharks proved unsuccessful". The situation eventually escalated to {{the point at which the}} divers had to retreat from the water. Excited Galapagos sharks are not easily deterred; driving one away physically only results in the shark circling back while inciting others to follow, whereas using weapons against them could trigger a feeding frenzy. As of 2008, the Galapagos shark has been confirmed to have attacked three people: one fatal attack in the Virgin Islands; a second fatal attack in the Virgin Islands, at Magens Bay on the north shore of St. Thomas; and a third non-fatal, attack off Bermuda.|$|E
6000|$|Substitutes.--The {{substitutes}} for thread, string, and cord, are as follows:--Thongs cut spirally, like a watch-spring, {{out of a}} piece of leather or hide, and made pliant by working them round a stick; sinew and catgut (pp. 346); inner bark of trees--this is easily separated by long steeping in water, but chewing it is better; roots of trees, as the spruce-fir, split to the proper size; woodbines, runners, or pliant twigs, twisted together. Some seaweeds--the only English one of which I have heard is the common olive-green weed called Chorda Filum; it looks like a whip-thong, and sometimes grows to a length of thirty or forty feet; when half-dried, the skin is taken off and twisted into fishing-lines, etc. Hay-bands; horsehair ropes, or even a few twisted hairs from the tail of a horse; the stems of numerous plants afford fibres that are more or less effective {{substitutes for}} hemp, those that are used by the natives of the country visited should be notices; [...] "Indian grass" [...] is an animal substance attached to the ovaries of <b>small</b> <b>sharks</b> and some other fish of the same class.|$|E
