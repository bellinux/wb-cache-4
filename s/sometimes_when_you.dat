500|$|Speaking of the song's lyrical background, Cruz told Pete Lewis of Blues & Soul: [...] "Its about {{breaking}} a girl's heart, {{but in a}} way that's kinda not on purpose. It's more that I'm just a single guy, trying to be single and trying to remain single. And <b>sometimes,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are in that place, you get girls who wanna be a part of what you're about – but, because you're not really ready for a relationship, those girls can end up being heartbroken. So what I'm basically saying is 'I might just break your heart. But I'm only gonna break your heart if you come through this way right now'." [...] Cruz also has called his song [...] "catchy" [...] with a [...] "good melody" [...] and [...] "fun topic", stating that [...] "both girls and guys can get into this character". In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Cruz elaborated and said the song was partially based on a personal situation, and rather an [...] "exaggeration of an experience".|$|E
500|$|Reyes {{said that}} the album was written solely for [...] "fun {{and the love of}} music, no expectations." [...] Their lyrics were {{inspired}} by personal experience. Nolan and Lazzara had a concept where some of the lyrics could be read [...] "like a play where one line is the boy and the next line is the girl ... <b>Sometimes</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> read the lyrics it's a little boring and it's more interesting this way". About half their song titles, according to Nolan, came from [...] "sitting around late at night watching TV". The title of [...] "Cute Without the 'E' (Cut from the Team)" [...] came when a friend of the band said that someone he knew was [...] "cut from the team". [...] "Great Romances of the 20th Century" [...] includes an audio sample from the film, Beautiful Girls (1996). Lazzara said [...] "The Blue Channel" [...] and [...] "Head Club" [...] were songs that the band used [...] "to get enough songs to fill a record so we could go on tour". The album's sound would later be described as emo. Around this time, Taking Back Sunday was influenced by emo bands the Get Up Kids and the Promise Ring.|$|E

[...] "Repetition of Hatred" [...] is another heavy track to the album, which gives a strong {{example of the}} backing vocal aspect, performed by Kaoru, Toshiya and Die, the latter who commented [...] "It's tough <b>sometimes</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have to sing and play your guitar at the same time.

In an interview with Vibe Magazine, Rock stated that he chose to do Broadway because he wanted more people to see him [...] "really act. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> do comedy, that can be a little formulaic, and it's hard for really good directors to see that you can act." ...|$|E

In an interview with Fortune, Mullins attributed the Academy with learning determination. [...] "There were so many times where we were challenged mentally and physically to try and unlock the potential inside of us, and I learned that <b>sometimes,</b> even <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are getting yelled at and told how much of a failure you are, the real accomplishment is learning to keep going in the face of adversity." ...|$|R

This generated longstanding controversy over their differences with B.I.G., and in later interviews, both rappers would downplay the incident: [...] "It {{was one of them}} skits where we was looking at our competition. And when Ghost is saying whatever he was saying, we kinda knew who he was talking about, but it wasn't like we was trying to start a beef.

2500|$|Although the ALF members reject {{violence}} against people, many activists support attacks on property, comparing {{the destruction of}} animal laboratories and other facilities to resistance fighters blowing up gas chambers in Nazi Germany. Their argument for sabotage is that the removal of animals from a laboratory simply means they will be quickly replaced, but if the laboratory itself is destroyed, it not only slows down the restocking process, but increases costs, possibly {{to the point of}} making animal research prohibitively expensive; this, they argue, will encourage the search for alternatives. An ALF activist involved in an arson attack on the University of Arizona told No Compromise in 1996: [...] "t is much the same thing as the abolitionists who fought against slavery going in and burning down the quarters or tearing down the auction block ... <b>Sometimes</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> just take animals and do nothing else, perhaps that is not as strong a message." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tinderbox {{would be}} later hailed by Jean-Benoît Dunckel of Air. He {{selected}} Tinderbox for his [...] "5 albums forever" [...] list, saying, [...] "They played so well together; I saw them in concert and I never forgot that moment". Billy Howerdel of A Perfect Circle rated {{it as his}} all-time favourite album [...] Howerdel described it as [...] "one of the spookiest records I've ever heard. Some of the songs on there have such a dense atmosphere. Sometimes when I'm stuck, I'll listen to that. It's like <b>sometimes</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have no inspiration and {{you go out and}} look at the moon, that's kind of what that record is for me". Jenny Lee Lindberg [...] of Warpaint cited the band among her influences, as well as the song [...] "Umbrella", initially included in the track listing of the 1986 CD version. She said: [...] "This is a song that my husband and I bonded over – we’d definitely heard it individually before, but one day we were just playing the album and that song stopped us in our tracks… played it on repeat for the whole night. I understand why some people can hear a little Siouxsie in what we do." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{interviewed by}} FourFourTwo magazine, McManaman stated, [...] "I think I {{probably}} least enjoyed my time when Glenn Hoddle was the manager. But I wouldn't {{say he was}} necessarily the worst. He had his ways of training and ways of acting and all managers have different ways of doing things; it's the same with club managers. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> join up with England and you don't play {{as often as you}} did under a certain other manager – then you'll think it's terrible. I loved going to play with England. For instance, I did get to go to the World Cup even though I only played for 17 minutes. That kind of experience leaves an indelible mark on your mind. So I don't really think of it in terms of [...] "worst"; but going to the World Cup and not playing much was a big thing for me, really, and that was under Glenn, of course." [...] Hoddle also notably arranged for McManaman to meet a disabled fan (and thus fulfill his lifelong wish of meeting McManaman) while the fan {{was on the verge of}} death, in 1997, to great media acclaim, though the story only broke a year after Hoddle had been sacked from the England job for alleged disparaging comments about disabled people.|$|E

5000|$|In {{an audio}} clip on MTV, Degraw speaks about the {{friction}} that occurs <b>when</b> <b>you</b> write your own music as an artist. “I think something interesting happens when you’re a songwriter and when you’re an artist as a songwriter.

So, in some ways (as an artist), sometimes you feel like you are inhibiting yourself, (by) not exploring something super fictional just because it’s cool.
