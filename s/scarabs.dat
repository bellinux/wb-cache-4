5|$|Different species use {{different}} pheromones. Scarab beetles {{such as the}} Rutelinae use pheromones derived from fatty acid synthesis, while other <b>scarabs</b> such as the Melolonthinae use amino acids and terpenoids. Another way beetles find mates {{is seen in the}} fireflies (Lampyridae) which are bioluminescent, with abdominal light-producing organs. The males and females engage in a complex dialogue before mating; each species has a unique combination of flight patterns, duration, composition, and intensity of the light produced.|$|E

At that time however, <b>Scarab</b> was the most strongest of all the Wulin Warriors, and the {{favorite}} of the Oracle, at the time. However, <b>Scarab</b> was unable to show humility and self-sacrifice rather than power, along with failing in a test of compassion. As a result of <b>Scarab's</b> lack of discipline, he was immediately sent into exile. Doing this truly hurt the Oracle deeply, due to <b>Scarab</b> being his most promising student. <b>Scarab</b> then vowed revenge against the Oracle {{and the rest of the}} Wulin Warriors. After hearing of the disappearance of the Seven Stars, <b>Scarab</b> knew he had a great opportunity to start a rebellion at that time.

5|$|Beetles are {{prominent}} in human culture, from the sacred <b>scarabs</b> of ancient Egypt to beetlewing art and use as pets or fighting insects for entertainment and gambling. Many beetle groups are brightly and attractively coloured making them objects of collection and decorative displays.

However, the major impact of beetles on human life is as agricultural, forestry, and horticultural pests. Serious pests include the boll weevil of cotton, the Colorado potato beetle, the coconut hispine beetle, and the mountain pine beetle. Most beetles, however, do not cause economic damage and many, such as the lady beetles and dung beetles are beneficial by helping to control insect pests.|$|E

5|$|The Egyptologists {{identifying}} Sheshi with Salitis follow Josephus, Sextus Julius Africanus and Eusebius {{who report}} that Manetho credited Salitis with 19 years of reign in his Aegyptiaca. Ryholt relies instead on a statistical method and estimates {{the duration of}} Sheshi's reign to have been between 20 and 53 years. The method consists in tallying the seals of Yakbim Sekhaenre, Ya'ammu Nubwoserre, Qareh Khawoserre and 'Ammu Ahotepre with those of Sheshi. Then, knowing that the first four of these kings reigned for at least c. 30 years, implies that they have left between 7.5 and 20 seals per year on throne. Consequently, Sheshi's nearly 400 <b>scarabs</b> would correspond to 20 to 53 years, which Ryholt gives as c. 40 years.|$|E

It is adaptable, and has learnt to eat the introduced European wasp (Vespula germanica). A bird that was being harassed by three scarlet robins (Petroica boodang) was seen to suddenly turn on them and catch and eat one. Other vertebrates recorded as prey include the house mouse (Mus musculus), small lizards, tadpoles, chickens, ducklings, the young of domestic turkey, Tasmanian nativehen (Gallinula mortierii), flame robin (Petroica phoenicea) and rabbit.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his official cult, Unas was deified and became a local god of the Saqqara necropolis. Grimal attributes this directly to the grandeur of his funerary complex. Malek doubts {{the existence of a}} popular cult of Unas during the Old Kingdom but acknowledges it from the Middle Kingdom onwards. He attributes this Middle Kingdom revival to the geographic position of Unas' complex making it a natural gateway to the Saqqara necropolis. The popular cult of the deified Unas continued for nearly 2,000 years as shown by the numerous <b>scarabs</b> bearing Unas' name found in Saqqara and dated from the New Kingdom (c.1550c.1077 BC) until the Late Period (664332 BC). The epicenter of this cult was not the pyramid of Unas nor the associated mortuary temple but rather the statues of the king in the valley temple.|$|E

5|$|The multisegmented legs end {{in two to}} five small {{segments}} called tarsi. Like {{many other}} insect orders, beetles have claws, usually one pair, {{on the end of}} the last tarsal segment of each leg. While most beetles use their legs for walking, legs have been variously adapted for other uses. Aquatic beetles including the Dytiscidae (diving beetles), Haliplidae, and many species of Hydrophilidae, the legs, often the last pair, are modified for swimming, typically with rows of long hairs. Male diving beetles have suctorial cups on their forelegs that they use to grasp females. Other beetles have fossorial legs widened and often spined for digging. Species with such adaptations are found among the <b>scarabs,</b> ground beetles, and clown beetles (Histeridae). The hind legs of some beetles, such as flea beetles (within Chrysomelidae) and flea weevils (within Curculionidae), have enlarged femurs that help them leap.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} dung beetle, {{especially}} the sacred scarab, Scarabaeus sacer, were revered in Ancient Egypt. The hieroglyphic {{image of the}} beetle may have had existential, fictional, or ontologic significance. Images of the scarab in bone, ivory, stone, Egyptian faience, and precious metals are known from the Sixth Dynasty {{and up to the}} period of Roman rule. The scarab was of prime significance in the funerary cult of ancient Egypt. The scarab was linked to Khepri, the god of the rising sun, from the supposed resemblance of the rolling of the dung ball by the beetle to the rolling of the sun by the god. Some of ancient Egypt's neighbors adopted the scarab motif for seals of varying types. The best-known of these are the Judean LMLK seals, where eight of 21 designs contained scarab beetles, which were used exclusively to stamp impressions on storage jars during the reign of Hezekiah. Beetles are mentioned {{as a symbol of the}} sun, as in ancient Egypt, in Plutarch's 1st century Moralia. The Greek Magical Papyri of the 2nd century BC to the 5th century AD describe <b>scarabs</b> as an ingredient in a spell.|$|E

25|$|In 1987, Luc Gabolde {{published}} an important study that statistically compared {{the number of}} surviving <b>scarabs</b> found under Thutmose I, Thutmose II and Hatshepsut. While monuments can be usurped, <b>scarabs</b> are so small and comparatively insignificant that altering their names would be impractical and without profit; hence, they provide a far better insight into this period. Hatshepsut's reign {{is believed to have}} lasted for 21 years and 9 months. Gabolde highlighted, in his analysis, the consistently small number of surviving <b>scarabs</b> known for Thutmose II compared to Thutmose I and Hatshepsut respectively; for instance, Flinders Petrie's older study of scarab seals noted 86 seals for Thutmose I, 19 seals for Thutmose II and 149 seals for Hatshepsut while more recent studies by Jaeger estimate a total of 241 seals for Thutmose I, 463 seals for Hatshepsut and only 65 seals for Thutmose II. Hence, unless there was an abnormally low number of <b>scarabs</b> produced under Thutmose II, this would indicate that the king's reign was rather short-lived. On this basis, Gabolde estimated Thutmose I and II's reigns to be approximately 11 and 3 full years, respectively. Consequently, the reign length of Thutmose II has been a much debated subject among Egyptologists with little consensus given the small number of surviving documents for his reign.|$|E
50|$|The Reach sent an Infiltrator to Earth, {{some time}} in the era of the Pharaohs. However, a sorcerer, believing the <b>scarab</b> to be a mystical implement, {{attempted}} to use it to revive a fallen Pharaoh. The attempt was stopped by a time-traveling Booster Gold, though the <b>Scarab</b> remained infused with mystical energies. In the 20th century, an archeologist Dan Garret located the <b>Scarab.</b> The <b>Scarab,</b> only half activated, granted Garret enhanced strength and speed, which Garret used to become the first Blue Beetle. When Garret died in battle, he passed the <b>Scarab</b> on to his student, Ted Kord. Kord, unable to access the <b>Scarab's</b> power, eventually passed it on to the wizard Shazam, who kept it within the Rock of Eternity. When the rock was destroyed, the <b>scarab</b> fell to Earth, and was found by Jaime Reyes, whom the <b>Scarab</b> proceeded to bond with soon after. However, by that time the <b>Scarab's</b> AI had been affected by the mystical energies it had been infused with, causing it to gain its own intelligence and personality. Instead of overwhelming Jaime's mind, it instead worked with it, allowing Jaime to use its powers to become a superhero. When The Reach became aware of this development, they changed their tactics, attempting to destroy the world via subterfuge. When Jaime undid these plans, The Reach captured him, removed the <b>Scarab,</b> and began a full-scale assault of Earth. However, the <b>Scarab</b> had given its knowledge to Jaime, allowing him to reclaim it, and cripple The Reach's ships. The remaining Reach were repelled by Earth's heroes, forcing them to retreat. The <b>Scarab</b> had also interfaced with several other Infiltrators, instilling within them their own independent personalities, creating the possibility that further Reach infiltrations would turn out the same as they did on Earth.|$|R
