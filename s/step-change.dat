2500|$|All {{elements}} absorb X-rays to some extent. Each element has {{a characteristic}} absorption spectrum {{which consists of}} a [...] "saw-tooth" [...] succession of fringes, each <b>step-change</b> of which has wavelength close to an emission line of the element. Absorption attenuates the secondary X-rays leaving the sample. For example, the mass absorption coefficient of silicon at the wavelength of the aluminium Kα line is 50 m²/kg, whereas that of iron is 377 m²/kg. This means that a given concentration of aluminium in a matrix of iron gives only one seventh of the count rate [...] {{compared with the same}} concentration of aluminium in a silicon matrix. Fortunately, mass absorption coefficients are well known and can be calculated. However, to calculate the absorption for a multi-element sample, the composition must be known. For analysis of an unknown sample, an iterative procedure is therefore used. It will be noted that, to derive the mass absorption accurately, data for the concentration of elements not measured by XRF may be needed, and various strategies are employed to estimate these. As an example, in cement analysis, the concentration of oxygen (which is not measured) is calculated by assuming that all other elements are present as standard oxides.|$|E

40|$|This article {{introduces}} some of {{the modern}} techniques for analyzing compositional zonings/profiles in metamorphic garnet, emphasizing the significance of two-dimensional composition X-ray mapping for such investigations. The compositional zonings/profiles in garnet {{can be divided into}} uniform-changed type and abrupt-changed type. The uniform-changed type is formed in equilibrium-controlled growth; the abrupt-changed type may be subdivided into <b>step-changed</b> subtype and spike-changed subtype, the forming mechanism of each is relatively complex. The <b>step-changed</b> subtype {{may be related to the}} processes such as poly-metamorphism, p-T changes with large magnitudes, and changes in metamorphic reactions or disturbance of crustal melting. As an example, the petrography, the major-and trace-element zoning and distribution patterns of REEs in the garnet from the Xiaomiao Group in the East Kunlun Mountains suggest two episodes of regional metamorphism. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|This article investigates a {{miniature}} thermoelectric module (MTEM) for pulse laser cooling. A <b>step-changed</b> cooling model is developed {{to predict the}} thermal performance of the MTEM. Interfacial effects of the MTEM are analyzed by considering the thermal non-equilibrium between electrons and phonons adjacent to thermoelectric/metal interface. Parametric studies were performed to analyze {{the effect of the}} pulse-width of laser, thermal resistance of hot-end heat exchanger, cooling load and the <b>step-changed</b> voltage on the system cooling performance. Particular attention is paid to the influence of scaling effect and supercooling effect on enhancing the miniature thermoelectric cooling (MTEC) performance. At a specific cooling load, the effects of pulse-changed and <b>step-changed</b> voltage on MTEC are numerically and experimentally studied. The MTEM can deal with not only the low cooling load of continuous laser, but also high cooling load of pulse laser which surpasses its' maximum cooling capacity. The transient response of cold-end temperature experiences an underdamped oscillation and finally reaching a steady-state value. A curve fitting equation for cold-end temperature is used to provide more accurate temperature and understand the temperature control strategy for pulse laser. The numerical result shows that the prediction by the model agrees well with the performance curve of datasheet and experimental data. It is also found that the voltage for achieving the maximum cooling capacity experiences step decrease with the increase of thermal resistance of hot-end heat exchanger.

40|$|This paper aims to {{describe}} a model which represents the formulation of decision-making processes (over a number of years) affecting the <b>step-changes</b> of walking and cycling (WaC) schemes.

The outputs of the model are pathways as to how the future might unfold (in terms of a number of future time steps) with respect to specific pedestrian and cyclist schemes. The transitions of the decision making processes are formulated using a qualitative simulation method, which describes the <b>step-changes</b> of the WaC scheme development.

40|$|The {{modified}} sinusoidal pulse-width modulation (SPWM) {{is one of}} the PWM {{techniques used}} in three-phase AC–DC buck converters. The modified SPWM works without the current sensor (the converter is current sensorless), improves production of sinusoidal AC current, enables obtainment of near-unity power factor, and controls output voltage through modulation gain (ranging from 0 to 1). The main problem of the modified SPWM is the huge starting current and voltage (during transient) that results from a large step change from the reference voltage. When the load changes, the output voltage significantly drops (through switching losses and non-ideal converter elements). The single-input single-output (SISO) approach with minor-loop voltage feedback controller presented here overcomes this problem. This approach is created on a theoretical linear model and verified by discrete-model simulation on MATLAB/Simulink. The capability and effectiveness of the SISO approach in compensating start-up current/voltage and in achieving zero steady-state error were tested for transient cases with <b>step-changed</b> load and <b>step-changed</b> reference voltage for linear and non-linear loads. Tests were done to analyze the transient performance against various controller gains. An experiment prototype was also developed for verification...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY. Cardiovascular {{responses}} to <b>step-changes</b> of carotid sinus pressure were evaluated at normal and {{elevated levels of}} plasma argjnine vasopressin in anesthetized neurohypophysec-tomized dogs (n = 12). Arginine vasopressin influenced autonomic function in two ways: first, maximum carotid reflex gain increased; second, cardiac output was decreased. The enhancement of reflex strength was observed only in response to decreases of intrasinus pressure below the equilibrium point (pressures of between 60 and 105 mm Hg). Aortic pressure rose twice as high for a given decrease of intrasinus pressure, elevations of total peripheral resistance responses were triple those observed at normal plasma arginine vasopressin. In this way, arginine vasopressin more than doubled {{the ability of the}} carotid reflexes to return a drop in arterial pressure to normal. Arginine vasopressin enhancement of reflex gain was not observed with elevations of intrasinus pressures above the equilibrium point. Elevation of aortic pressure expected from the vasoconstrictor actions of infused arginine vasopressin were buffered by associated reductions in cardiac output. Vagally mediated bradycardia was consistently observed with elevated arginine vasopressin, but the reflex response of heart rate to <b>step-changes</b> of intrasinus pressure was unchanged.

40|$|International audienceThe {{electrical}} conductivity of basaltic melts has been measured in real-time after fO 2 <b>step-changes</b> {{in order to}} investigate redox kinetics. Experimental investigations were performed at 1 atm in a vertical furnace between 1200 °C and 1400 °C using air, pure CO 2 or CO/CO 2 gas mixtures to buffer oxygen fugacity in the range 10 - 8 to 0. 2 bars. Ferric/ferrous ratios were determined by wet chemical titrations. A small but detectable effect of fO 2 on the {{electrical conductivity}} is observed. The more reduced the melt, the higher the conductivity. A modified Arrhenian equation accounts for both T and fO 2 effects on the electrical conductivity. We show that time-dependent changes in electrical conductivity following fO 2 <b>step-changes</b> monitor the rate of Fe 2 +/Fe 3 + changes. The conductivity change with time corresponds to a diffusion-limited process {{in the case of}} reduction in CO-CO 2 gas mixtures and oxidation in air. However, a reaction at the gas-melt interface probably rate limits oxidation of the melt under pure CO 2. Reduction and oxidation rates are similar and both increase with temperature. Those rates range from 10 - 9 to 10 - 8 m 2 /s for the temperature interval 1200 - 1400 °C and show activation energy of about 200 kJ/mol.
