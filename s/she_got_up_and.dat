5|$|During the quarter-finals, Canada {{faced the}} United States with McLeod {{starting}} in goal. In the twelfth {{minute of the}} game, American player Heather O'Reilly made a shot on goal, but it was stopped by McLeod. Angela Hucles then got the rebound and scored for the United States. However, McLeod injured her right knee during the play. She was down for several minutes before <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> attempted to resume playing. A few minutes later, she was replaced by goalkeeper Karina LeBlanc in the 19th minute. The United States won the game 1–2. It was later revealed that McLeod had torn her right ACL.|$|E
2500|$|The {{enormous}} success had {{inspired the}} author to continue writing [...] There followed seventeen historical series (sixty-five books), {{a collection of}} eighteen short story Novels, three unique Novels – all in all eighty-six books. For her researches Benzoni was often seen [...] at the local library Monaco in Saint-Mandé. She travelled {{all over the world}} to visit on locaction castle's, museums, monastery, libraries and villages for her work. Sometimes it was enough to see in a museum a painting to inspire her for a new story. She never kept a computer. Each morning at six-thirty <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> started writing on her old electric typewriter and wrote three pages – never missing a day, even on Sundays.|$|E
2500|$|Miranda {{performed}} at the New Frontier Hotel in Las Vegas in April 1955, and in [...] Cuba three months later before returning to Los Angeles to recuperate from a recurrent bronchial ailment. On 4 August, she was filming a segment for the NBC variety series The Jimmy Durante Show. According to Durante, Miranda had complained of feeling unwell before filming; he offered to find her a replacement, but she declined. After completing [...] "Jackson, Miranda, and Gomez", a song-and-dance number with Durante, she fell to one knee. Durante later said, [...] "I thought she had slipped. <b>She</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> said she was outa [...] breath. I told her I'll take her lines. But she goes ahead with 'em. We finished work about 11 o'clock and she seemed happy." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> earlier <b>and</b> earlier. <b>She</b> now rose {{yesterday}} afternoon.|$|R
60|$|As I {{was turning}} away <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> quickly <b>and</b> {{put her hand}} on my shoulder.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> abruptly, <b>and</b> left me. I did {{not follow}} her. In my heart I {{understood}} why....|$|R
2500|$|On July 11, {{the couple}} were seen rowing out on Big Moose Lake near Covewood Lodge. Gillette had entered the {{pseudonym}} [...] "Carl Grahm" [...] in the hotel register (Gillette's suitcase was monogrammed [...] "C.E.G.", and he was careful to choose a name with the same initials). Gillette {{is believed to have}} struck Brown over the head with a tennis racket, as the result of which she fell out of the boat and drowned. Gillette returned alone, and gave varying explanations for what had occurred. Brown's body was found the next day, and Gillette was arrested in the nearby town of Inlet. The defense at trial attempted to explain that Grace was perplexed and at a point just jumped out of the boat, and into the water. Gillette testified, [...] "We talked a little more, then <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> jumped in the water, just jumped in." ...|$|E
60|$|Then <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> joined Dick Halliday, and Jim felt puzzled.|$|E
60|$|So <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> {{began to}} explore {{some of the}} many rooms of the palace.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>up,</b> smiling, <b>and</b> {{advanced}} to meet Chisholm and Flora, {{who came up}} the garden path.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> abruptly, <b>and</b> {{went to the}} window. And {{when she}} turned to him again, it was with {{something}} of the old bravado.|$|R
60|$|Our Missis's lips so quivered, that Mrs. Sniff, though {{scarcely}} less convulsed than <b>she</b> were, <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> {{held the}} tumbler to them.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> moved indignantly {{about the}} room, pushing a chair {{out of her}} way.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>got</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> Cartwright dozed {{until he}} heard a step and Lister crossed the floor.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> {{looked at}} him shyly, with color in her face and her eyes shining.|$|E
60|$|Rilla {{concluded}} {{that she had}} humiliated herself enough. There was {{such a thing as}} self-respect. No more coaxing, concert or no concert. <b>She</b> <b>got</b> <b>up,</b> boot <b>and</b> all.|$|R
60|$|In {{the morning}} <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> early, <b>and</b> dressed very quietly, keeping the blinds down, {{so as not}} to disturb Jamie. She took a little breakfast, kissed her {{sleeping}} child--one long, loving kiss,--and was gone.|$|R
6000|$|... "The job is ours," [...] said Margaret quietly, but Jardine {{thought the}} blood {{came to her}} skin. <b>She,</b> however, <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> when <b>she</b> had put out the plates for breakfast went to bed.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> walked {{about the}} room, angrily {{brushing}} aside the proffered attentions of Mr. Tucker.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> {{walked to}} the door, and her brother {{did not attempt to}} stop her.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> {{went to the}} table, {{and felt}} inside the {{pie-dish}} again with a spoon.|$|E
60|$|Next morning <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> {{very early}} <b>and</b> began a spring {{cleaning}} which lasted a fortnight.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Vyner bent {{a little}} lower, but so slowly that Miss Hartley was {{compelled}} to notice it. <b>She</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> suddenly <b>and</b> confronted him. He took both her hands in his, but so gently that she offered no resistance.|$|R
60|$|The squire, who {{was holding}} her close to him while <b>she</b> spoke, <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> rang the bell; and John opened the door, with a quickness that showed {{that he had been}} waiting close to it, anxiously waiting a summons.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Kemp {{considered}} it a judgment of Providence. <b>She</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> mixed some whisky and water.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> {{came to his}} side; {{she could}} not speak sitting there with his eyes on her.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> {{slipped into}} the garden, and with Mr. Truefitt in {{attendance}} paced {{up and down the}} narrow paths.|$|E
60|$|She ceased as {{suddenly}} as <b>she</b> had begun, <b>got</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and,</b> before he too could rise, was gone.|$|R
60|$|When the old witch {{had gone}} away the Princess hid the thread very carefully, <b>and</b> at night <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> quietly, <b>and</b> with a beating heart she bound the thread round her husband's foot. Just as she was pulling the knot tight there was a crack, and the thread broke, for it was rotten.|$|R
6000|$|All {{this was}} {{received}} {{with a kind}} of silent sneer from the invisible assembly in the background. The candle was burning low, the fire was sinking too. In vain the dark-browed man tried to build it up. The q-b became impatient for the food. <b>She</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> wrathfully <b>and</b> stumbled into the dark passage, exclaiming--"Don't we eat yet?" ...|$|R
60|$|She did not answer, and {{presently}} <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> {{said she}} was going to bed. She gave a timid little smile.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and,</b> {{avoiding}} to {{look within}} the cabin, walked away. The sun was {{almost at the}} zenith. Where had the morning hours gone? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then she has interfered," [...] said Lady Eustace, as <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> {{walked across}} the room, with a sweet smile to the old cat.|$|E
6000|$|He {{had dropped}} into a chair as he talked, and so long as she {{remained}} in her own they were confronted; but <b>she</b> presently <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and,</b> the next moment, while he kept his place, was busy restoring order to the objects both her visitors had disarranged. [...] "If you weren't delightful you'd be dreadful!" ...|$|R
60|$|Then, one day {{she came}} back, and Steele, who was {{watching}} me as <b>she</b> entered, quietly <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> without a word took Diane {{out of the room}} and left me alone with Sally.|$|R
6000|$|Isabel {{thought this}} rather sharp; <b>she</b> also <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> stood a moment {{looking into the}} fire. [...] "Lord Warburton has shown you great attention," [...] she resumed; [...] "of course you know it's of him I speak." [...] She found herself, against her expectation, almost placed in the {{position}} of justifying herself; which led her to introduce this nobleman more crudely than she had intended.|$|R
