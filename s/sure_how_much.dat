5|$|Because {{of release}} schedules—especially {{in the case}} of films {{released}} {{towards the end of the}} year—and different release patterns across the world, many films can do business in two or more calendar years; therefore the grosses documented here are not confined to just the year of release. Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained. At least one film every year has generated $100 million in gross revenue at the box office since 1967, and from 2008 each year has succeeded in producing a billion dollar grossing film.|$|E

Ann Hornaday praised the prologue, describing it as [...] "worthy of Chaplin in its heartbreaking poignancy." [...] Chicago Tribune editor Michael Phillips praised the scene, describing it as an emotional and cinematic powerhouse, and that he also was nearly moved to tears. However, Salon.com editor Stephanie Zacharek criticized the love between Carl and Ellie, describing their marriage as resembling a dental adhesive commercial more than a real relationship.|$|E

But Gerald disapproved of married clergy (which had been declining generally though only finally abolished by Rome in the eleventh century and deplored in principle the inheritance of church office.

In any case, no move was made by Archbishop Baldwin in favour of reform: the Lord Rhys was with them, and they would not have wished to offend him. In any event, it would have been a matter for the Bishop of St David's, who was Peter de Leia. There is then no further information about Llanbadarn for nearly sixty years.|$|E

2500|$|An early {{draft for}} the remake had moved the setting to {{northern}} California, and altered the third act to include {{elements of the}} supernatural. When that script was rejected, Carl Ellsworth {{was brought in to}} touch up the script written by Adam Alleca. Ellsworth had previously worked with Craven on Red Eye, but had never seen the original Last House on the Left. After reading the script and watching the 1972 film—the latter he found difficult to watch because of its extreme nature—Ellsworth decided that the first thing they needed to do was to establish someone whose survival you wanted the audience to root for. The writer wanted to know how the [...] "typical family" [...] would react to such a heinous act being perpetrated on their daughter, and what they were truly capable of. Craven points out that most of the early script problems were based around deciding what elements to include.

2500|$|The {{box office}} gross of The Birth of a Nation is not known, and was long subject to exaggeration. At {{the end of}} 1917, Epoch {{reported}} to its shareholders cumulative receipts of $4.8 million, and Griffith's own records put Epoch's worldwide earnings from the film at $5.2 million as of 1919, although the distributor's share of the revenue at this time was {{much lower than the}} exhibition gross. In the biggest cities, Epoch negotiated with individual theater owners for a percentage of the box office; elsewhere, the producer sold all rights in a particular state to a single distributor (an arrangement known as [...] "state's rights" [...] distribution). The film historian Richard Schickel says that under the state's rights contracts, Epoch typically received about 10% of the box office gross—which theater owners often underreported—and concludes that [...] "Birth certainly generated more than $60 million in box-office business in its first run". By 1940 Time magazine estimated the film's cumulative gross rental (the distributor's earnings) at approximately $15 million. For years Variety had the gross rental listed as $50 million, but in 1977 repudiated the claim and revised its estimate down to $5 million. It is not known for <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> the film has earned in total, but producer Harry Aitken put its estimated earnings at $15–18 million in a letter to a prospective investor in a proposed sound version. It is likely the film earned over $20 million for its backers, and generated $50–100 million in box office receipts.|$|E

40|$|Rational agents will {{discount}} {{information that}} they know comes from a biased source. This suggests that they cannot be swayed by reported information they know to be biased.

However, strong political motives that are not too dissimilar from those of the citizenry may lead to mergers that restrict the information divulged, and thus might be proscribed. If political motives are weak, then the merged entity will want to commit to impartial reporting, so that mergers are not harmful to information dissemination...|$|R

6000|$|The {{two books}} by which Sterne is remembered are Tristram Shandy and A Sentimental Journey through France and Italy. These are termed novels {{for the simple}} reason that we know not what else to call them. The former was begun, in his own words, [...] "with no real idea of how it was to turn out"; its nine volumes, {{published}} at intervals from 1760 to 1767, proceeded in the most aimless way, recording the experiences of the eccentric Shandy family; and the book was never finished. Its strength lies chiefly in its brilliant style, the most remarkable of the age, and in its odd characters, like Uncle Toby and Corporal Trim, which, with all their eccentricities, are so humanized by the author's genius that they belong among the great [...] "creations" [...] of our literature. The Sentimental Journey is a curious combination of fiction, sketches of travel, miscellaneous essays on odd subjects,--all marked by the same brilliancy of style, and all stamped with Sterne's false attitude towards everything in life. Many of its best passages were either adapted or taken bodily from Burton, Rabelais, and a score of other writers; so that, in reading Sterne, one is never quite <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> is his own work, though the mark of his grotesque genius is on every page.|$|E
60|$|I {{looked again}} at Michael Angelo's Fates to-day; but cannot satisfactorily make out {{what he meant by}} them. One of them--she who holds the distaff--has her mouth open, as if uttering a cry, and might be fancied to look {{somewhat}} irate. The second, who holds the thread, has a pensive air, but is still, I think, pitiless at heart. The third sister looks closely and coldly into the eyes of the second, meanwhile cutting the thread with a pair of shears. Michael Angelo, if I may presume to say so, wished to vary the expression of these three sisters, and give each a different one, but did not see precisely how, inasmuch as all the fatal Three are united, heart and soul, in one purpose. It is a very impressive group. But, as regards the interpretation of this, or of any other profound picture, there are likely to be as many interpretations as there are spectators. It is very curious to read criticisms upon pictures, and upon the same face in a picture, and by men of taste and feeling, and to find what different conclusions they arrive at. Each man interprets the hieroglyphic in his own way; and the painter, perhaps, had a meaning which none of them have reached; or possibly he put forth a riddle, without himself knowing the solution. There is such a necessity, at all events, of helping the painter out with the spectator's own resources of feeling and imagination, that you can never be <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of the picture you have yourself made. There {{is no doubt that the}} public is, to a certain extent, right and sure of its ground, when it declares, through a series of ages, that a certain picture is a great work. It is so; a great symbol, proceeding out of a great mind; but if it means one thing, it seems to mean a thousand, and, often, opposite things.|$|E

50|$|With that said, {{there are}} some {{concerns}} related to cause marketing. The issue of trust has emerged as central to {{the potential for the}} impact of cause marketing. Specifically, 78% of consumers reported that a partnership between a nonprofit and a company that they trust makes a cause stand out (2010, Cone Nonprofit Marketing Trend Tracker). If a consumer doesn't trust the business that is behind the cause marketing campaign, it can be seen as an insincere effort to attract more loyalty from consumers. For that reason, {{it is important that the}} cause marketing campaign be authentic to the brand image of the products which are running the marketing campaign. Another potential issue with cause marketing is the possible increase in the price of the cause-related products. In fact, only 19% of consumers would be willing to buy a more expensive brand if it supported a cause (Cone, 2010). Consumers are also not <b>sure</b> about <b>how</b> <b>much</b> money actually gets donated, according to Eikenberry (2009). In the age of social media, it is essential that the business supporting the cause marketing campaign is transparent about how the funds are being used and what amount/percent of funds are donated to the cause.|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. The main {{objective of this}} research project is to understand how people negotiate and what aspects of the situation they use {{as an aid to}} reach an agreement. Any aspect of a bargaining situation that helps bargainers to coordinate their expectations and behaviour so as to reach an agreement is called a 'focal point'. The purpose of this research is to extend our knowledge about focal points in bargaining situations. There are two sub-projects: In some bargaining situations, such as the division of land, allocation of mineral deposits or oil fields, or the division of an inheritance, there may be no division of the valuable resource that equates money earnings and there may be no equitable outcome. What aspects, if any, become focal in such situations? In many bargaining situations negotiators are not <b>sure</b> about <b>how</b> <b>much</b> others stand to gain from any given agreement. How does the absence of such information influence the focality of various divisions of the resource? Real bargaining situations are complex {{and it is difficult to}} find 'clean' data that allows one to isolate the role of particular factors on the observed bargaining behaviour. We shall therefore use lab experiments. This allows us to isolate the role played by a variable of interest while controlling for the influence of other potential factors...|$|R
60|$|Beaton {{scarcely}} {{understood it}} himself, {{perhaps because he}} was not yet twenty-seven. He only knew that his will was somehow sick; that it spent itself in caprices, and brought him no happiness from the fulfilment of the most vehement wish. But he was aware that his wishes grew less and less vehement; he began to have a fear that some time he might have none at all. It seemed to him that if he could once do something that was thoroughly distasteful to himself, he might make a beginning in the right direction; but when he tried this on a small scale, it failed, and it seemed stupid. Some sort of expiation was the thing he needed, he was sure; but he could not think of anything in particular to expiate; a man could not expiate his temperament, and his temperament was what Beaton decided to be at fault. He perceived that it went deeper than even fate would have gone; he could have fulfilled an evil destiny and had done with it, however terrible. His trouble was that he could not escape from himself; and, for the most part, he justified himself in refusing to try. After he had come to that distinct understanding with Alma Leighton, and experienced the relief it really gave him, he thought for a while that if it had fallen out otherwise, and she had put him in charge of her destiny, he might have been better able to manage his own. But as it was, he could only drift, and let all other things take their course. It was necessary that he should go to see her afterward, to show her that he was equal to the event; but he did not go so often, and he went rather oftener to the Dryfooses; it was not easy to see Margaret Vance, except on the society terms. With much sneering and scorning, he fulfilled the duties to Mrs. Horn without which he knew he should be dropped from her list; but one might go to many of her Thursdays without getting many words with her niece. Beaton hardly knew whether he wanted many; the girl kept the charm of her innocent stylishness; but latterly she wanted to talk more about social questions than about the psychical problems that young people usually debate so personally. Son of the working-people as he was, Beaton had never cared anything about such matters; he did not know about them or wish to know; he was perhaps too near them. Besides, there was an embarrassment, at least on her part, concerning the Dryfooses. She was too high-minded to blame him for having tempted her to her failure with them by his talk about them; but she was conscious of avoiding them in her talk. She had decided not to renew the effort she had made in the spring; because she could not do them good as fellow-creatures needing food and warmth and work, and she would not try to befriend them socially; she had a horror of any such futile sentimentality. She would have liked to account to Beaton in this way for a course which she suspected he must have heard their comments upon, but she did not quite know how to do it; she could not be <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> or how little he cared for them. Some tentative approaches which she made toward explanation were met with such eager disclaim of personal interest that she knew less than before what to think; and she turned the talk from the sisters to the brother, whom it seemed she still continued to meet in their common work among the poor.|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] The State-Level Paid Family and Medical Leave {{simulation}} model we developed estimates {{the number of}} family and medical leaves taken or needed in a state {{as well as the}} current employer and employee wage costs associated with those leaves. The model has the capacity to estimate the new and redistributed wage-replacement costs of any new proposed program. The {{simulation model}} relies on information collected from a survey on leave taking behavior conducted by Abt Associates for the US Department of Labor in 2012. Using this information we are able to estimate the probability of who takes a leave, what type, for how long, and based on if they receive employer pay and their own income level the use of a paid leave program. We use these probability estimates to simulate leave taking in Massachusetts using data about individuals from the American Community Survey which allows us to also estimate a host of geographic, employer, and employee characteristics about leave takers and needers. We simulate the decision to use a program versus not to use a program based on several knowable aspects that might go into this decision. These include the generosity of the program compared to employer benefits, length of leave taken, length of leave covered by the program, eligibility requirements, job protection, and individual demographics. But there are decisions to use a program that we cannot model, because these are unknown. These include ease of use, knowledge of the program, and workplace culture in the state. These later aspects will affect the take-up of the program, but we are not <b>sure</b> by <b>how</b> <b>much...</b>|$|R
