After launching, SuomenJoutsen broke her {{moorings}} in the <b>strong</b> <b>breeze</b> and damaged two ships, gunboat Karjala and Osmo, a laid-up full rigged ship built in 1869, before she was brought under control.

500|$|Bungee {{launching}} {{was widely}} used {{in the early days}} of gliding, and occasionally gliders are still launched from the top of a gently sloping hill into a <b>strong</b> <b>breeze</b> using a substantial multi-stranded rubber band, or [...] "bungee". For this launch method, the glider's main wheel rests in a small concrete trough. The hook normally used for winch-launching is instead attached to the middle of the bungee. Each end is then pulled by three or four people. One group runs slightly to the left, the other to the right. Once the tension in the bungee is high enough, the glider is released and the glider's wheel pops out of the trough. The glider gains just enough energy to leave the ground and fly away from the hill.|$|E
500|$|By 1811, the Royal Navy {{enjoyed a}} {{worldwide}} naval supremacy over the French, including the seas immediately off the French coast. To avoid being attacked {{as they left}} Brest, French ships had to attempt to slip out either {{under cover of darkness}} or during storms that drove the British away from the dangerous coastline. This also however forced the French ships to fight against the wind to leave their harbours and as a result, Roquebert's ships only covered [...] in the first 18 days. On 24 February, the squadron captured a Portuguese merchant ship and discovered Lisbon newspapers aboard that announced the British invasion, although not its outcome. On 13 March, Roquebert's ships crossed the Equator and on 18 April they passed the Cape of Good Hope at distance, benefitting from good weather and a <b>strong</b> <b>breeze</b> during the latter stages of the journey. At 23:00 on 6 May, 93 days after leaving Brest, the French convoy arrived off Île de la Passe at the entrance to Grand Port.|$|E

5000|$|Current Cherubs use an {{asymmetric}} spinnaker system but earlier boats used relatively large double luff spinnakers {{and used a}} notably long (9 foot) spinnaker pole.

500|$|Like other elanid kites, black-shouldered kites hunt by {{quartering}} grasslands {{for small}} creatures. This can {{be from a}} perch, but more often by hovering in mid-air. When hunting the kite hovers with its body hanging almost vertically, and its head into the wind. Unlike the Australian kestrel, the black-winged kite shows no obvious sideways movement, even in a <b>strong</b> <b>breeze.</b> One study of a nesting pair noted that the male searched aerially for 82% of the search time. Typically, a kite will hover [...] above a particular spot, peering down intently, sometimes {{for only a few}} seconds, often for a minute or more, then glide swiftly to a new vantage point and hover again. When hunting from a perch, a dead tree is the preferred platform. Like other Elanus kites, The black-shouldered kite grips a vertical branch with a foot on either side, each one above the other and turned inwards, which enables them to maintain a secure footing on relatively small branches. Though hovering is the most common hunting method, the kites have been observed searching the ground beneath a vantage point for periods of up to an hour.|$|E
500|$|The {{weather for}} the race was good, as was the tide, but a <b>strong</b> <b>breeze</b> made for some rough water. [...] Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station, handing the Middlesex {{side of the river}} to Oxford. [...] Making the better start of the two crews, Cambridge were a length ahead by Walden's Wharf and had {{extended}} that by another half-length by the time they passed the Crab Tree pub. [...] Oxford came back into contention {{and by the time the}} crews shot Hammersmith Bridge there was [...] "little or no daylight between the boats." [...] The other side of the bridge the crews hit rough water and as Cambridge had the advantage of shelter on their side of the river, they pulled away quickly to be three lengths clear by Chiswick. [...] As the bend of the river began to favour the Dark Blues, they drew up once again and were almost level by Barnes Bridge when their number seven Douglas McLean broke his oar in two, effectively ending his participation in the race. Cambridge pulled away again and won by two-and-a-half lengths in a time of 20 minutes 52 seconds. [...] It was their second consecutive victory and their fastest time since the 1876 race. The win took the overall record to 2320 in Oxford's favour.|$|E

2500|$|On 21 October 1942 Palatia was sailing off Lindesnes, Norway, {{escorted by}} the {{submarine}} chaser UJ 1704 and a Junkers Ju 88.

One of the escorts had also suffered engine failure. Palatias renewed departure from Kristiansand only occurred at 09:00. This left her in an exposed position in poor weather when, at 15:05, she was discovered by one of four Handley Page Hampden torpedo bombers from No. 489 Squadron RNZAF of the RAF Coastal Command that were patrolling the Norwegian coastline that day.

2500|$|As {{they had}} in the NLDS in 2012 and 2014, the Nationals faced {{elimination}} in Game [...] 4, which took place on a damp and chilly afternoon and evening with a <b>strong</b> <b>breeze</b> from Lake Michigan blowing in from the outfield, knocking down long fly balls for both teams that might have been home runs. Once, again, both teams enjoyed excellent outings by their starting pitchers. [...] Although still recovering from his illness, Strasburg pitched an impressive seven shutout innings in which he threw 106 pitches, 72 of them for strikes, gave up only three hits and two walks, and struck out 12 Cubs, a new Montreal-Washington franchise postseason single-game strikeout record that broke the record Strasburg had set himself in Game 1 on October 6, when he had fanned 10 Cubs. The biggest Cubs scoring threat of his outing came {{in the bottom of the}} second inning, when Chicago third baseman Ben Zobrist [...] doubled with one out, then tagged and advanced to third on shortstop Addison Russell’s fly out. Strasburg then walked center fielder Jason Heyward , but got second baseman Javier Báez to ground out to end the inning without the Cubs scoring. He allowed only one more Cub to reach second base, when catcher Willson Contreras singled and advanced to second on a Strasburg throwing error in the bottom of the fourth inning, but he struck out the side to extinguish that threat as well. Strasburg left the game having struck out 22 Cubs in his two 2017 NLDS appearances, becoming only the third MLB pitcher in history to strike out ten or more batters twice in the same division series and the first National League pitcher to do it in any postseason series since Bob Gibson for the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1968 World Series. In his three career postseason playoff appearances combined - one in 2014 and two in 2017 - Strasburg had posted a 0.49 ERA over 19 innings, striking out 24 and issuing only four walks. [...] In his last ten appearances of 2017 combined, including the two NLDS games, he had pitched to an ERA of 0.69.|$|E
