On a range of general health and occupational safety and health indicators, some three years after joining the European Union, Lithuania is currently a poor performer, and on key indicators the poorest in the European Union. Yet, formally, Lithuania has comprehensive health and safety legislation in line with EU requirements. Survey data suggest, however, a work regime of intensification and an absence of a participative working environment in which employees have a 'voice' in the safety management process. European-style legislative reforms appear to be having only limited positive measurable effects on health and safety performance. Moreover, the new EU occupational safety and health strategy for 2007 to 2012 fails to take account of the deteriorated working environments in the workplaces of post-communist new member states such as Lithuania...|$|R

40|$|This article {{deals with}} a <b>specific</b> <b>legacy,</b> {{concerning}} the labour force, with which transition countries have been burdened while instituting systemic change. The majority of authors have concentrated on what this author calls transition cyclical unemployment, resulting from the permanent excess demand {{and the lack of}} penalty for financial failure under the communist economic system. However, another, more pernicious legacy has been the distorted skill structure in communist economies. This article explains the sources of a bias in favour of low-skilled workers in the past. In consequence, when transition began, these economies were faced with heavy excess supply of low-skilled and high demand for better skilled workers. The latter stemmed from normal requirements of economic development, that is, the need for continuous output quality improvement, technological upgrading and change in the portfolio of goods and services produced. Among the consequences of the sharp downward change in demand for low-skilled labour have been growing wage differentials and the emergence of a large pool of unemployed (and often unemployable) low-skilled labour, which may be called transition structural unemployment. In macroeconomic terms an unusually high unemployment rate was observed for about a decade following the beginning of transition. ...|$|E
50|$|In the United States, {{state law}} determines which {{lifetime}} gifts {{are treated as}} gifts in satisfaction of a bequest. Under the Uniform Probate Code, § 2-609, a lifetime gift is treated as satisfaction of a legacy only if (i) the will provides for deduction of the gift, (ii) the testator indicated in a contemporaneous writing that the lifetime gift was intended to satisfy a legacy in the will, or (iii) the gift recipient acknowledged in writing that the gift was intended to satisfy a legacy in the will. Courts may presume that gifts of money from a parent to a child after {{the execution of the}} parent's will are gifts in satisfaction of the child's legacy under the will, even without a written indication of intent to satisfy the provision under the will. Courts are reluctant to apply the doctrine to certain kinds of legacies, for example, devises of specific real estate or bequests of personal property. These <b>specific</b> <b>legacies</b> are viewed by courts as unique and not able to be replaced with a lifetime gift of money or other property.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the perceptions}} of media freedom and responsibility by journalists and politicians in South Korea during the Presidency of Roh Moo-huyn (2003 - 8). It draws on in-depth interviews with ten journalists and ten politicians with different political affiliations and interests. Findings suggest that both groups had positive appraisals of the country?s media democratisation. For them the media could function as a watchdog on political power without having to fear direct political reprisals for doing so. However, the political press remained partially shackled to <b>specific</b> <b>legacies</b> and economic conditions. The most pressing example {{is the way the}} paternal power of conservative media owners challenged the editorial independence of journalists. While the internet media offered some hope to re-balance the power relationship between the conservative and progressive forces, the sensational and hyper-adversarial media motivated by market and political competition emerged as more worrying concerns for the consolidation of democratic political communication in post-transition South Korea. Setbacks in press freedom since 2008 have undermined some of the positive evaluations of the political communication in South Korea, suggesting that the democratic transition in this country resembles ?a circle rather a straight line?. authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Although some of {{the most}} {{important}} works on multi-agent systems focused on interoperating multi-agent systems with legacy applications, the main results consisted in the definition of two agent communication languages, i. e., KQML and FIPA ACL, and a set of specifications, i. e., the FIPA specifications, for the realization of interoperable multi-agent systems. Nowadays, web services are the primary mean to provide interoperability with legacy applications and the large part of multi-agent applications have been realized without any strong requirement for the interoperability with other multiagent applications. This paper presents the HDS software framework, which provides a software infrastructure to realize multi-agent applications that either take advantage of the specifications for agent-to-agent interoperability or are implemented for optimizing their performance, reducing their development cost and/or simplifying their interaction with some <b>specific</b> <b>legacy</b> applications. Typed messages and message filters are the elements that mainly characterize such a software framework. Besides describing the main features of such a software framework, this paper introduces two different application scenarios designed to exploit HDS features: i) a prototype framework for distributed constraint satisfaction algorithms and ii) a distributed social network system.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedWhen the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) {{was formed in}} 2003, 22 distinct agencies and directorates were consolidated into one organization. The Homeland Security Act of 2002, which mandated DHS’ creation, also required that functions performed by other agencies within the Department—those not related directly to securing the homeland—not be diminished or neglected. DHS has been challenged to produce annual budgets that clearly delineate homeland security and non-homeland security functions, {{making it difficult to}} assess whether legacy functions have been diminished. This thesis utilized a policy analysis research method to review budget exhibits from fiscal years 2004 – 2013 in order to analyze funding levels for DHS components’ <b>specific</b> <b>legacy</b> functions. Findings revealed that some functions have received decreased funding without a commensurate reduction in demand for that service. The need to unequivocally define which DHS activities are considered homeland security-related emerged as a recurring theme in the research as well. Using a multi-goal policy approach, the study assessed potential courses of action and ultimately makes two recommendations: to pursue a pilot test of modified budget submission requirements for a limited number of DHS components, and to benchmark business processes followed by the Departments of Interior and Commerce.

40|$|From a {{detailed}} analysis of the roles of childhood experience, schooling and educational qualifications in the emergence of adult social exclusion, two key patterns emerge: Educational qualifications show a strong relationship to all 36 measures of adult disadvantage (at ages 23 and 33 for both men and women; and the association is generally stronger at age 33 than at age 23. This relationship emerges net of controls {{for a wide range of}} childhood factors. Childhood poverty is the most frequent clear predictor of negative adult outcomes. Additionally: Mother's interest in schooling is more salient for women, whilst father's interest matters more for men; Low parental interest in schooling, frequent absence from school, and low educational test scores are all quite influential on subsequent disadvantage, even net of qualification levels; Early contact with the police is more closely related to adult outcomes for men, but school absences are more influential for women.

Yet Camus’s work is a natural entry point into the EU’s trade relations with the global south, and Algeria’s case is a particularly salient one, given the oft-ignored fact that for five years the Algerian nation {{was a part of}} the European Economic Community. The onset of a free trade regime between the EU and the former colonies or territories of its member states is often touted as the culminating point in a line of constant progress, from dependency to autonomy and from asymmetry to parity. But a closer look at the experience of Algeria reveals that massive trade diversion resulted, in a not so distant past, from the very birth of the Common Market, and that current policies are not adequately redressing the effects of such lopsided arrangements. The point of these pages, linking the 1960 s death of Algeria’s wine exports to the country’s ongoing struggle to diversify its economy, is not to provide generalizable lessons or overarching guidelines for the trade policies of developed nations.

40|$|The {{fall of the}} Berlin Wall in 1989 signalled a {{major change}} for Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries. Despite the {{significant}} benefits gained with the ‘return to Europe’, CEE countries have also been faced with large challenges (Gentile, Tammaru, & van Kempen, 2012; Kornai, 2006; Kovács, 1999; Shleifer & Treisman, 2014). They had to transform their political and economic systems and {{find new ways to}} establish themselves in the context of increasing globalization, liberalization and technological progress. This has led to rapid and significant changes in their socio-spatial organization (Brade, Herfert, & Wiest, 2009; Gentile et al., 2012; Lang, 2011; Lang, Henn, Sgibnev, & Ehrlich, 2015; Schmidt, Fina, & Siedentop, 2015; Smith & Timár, 2010). According to Stanilov (2007), due to the very rapid pace of change, the recent socio-spatial developments in CEE countries {{can be seen as a}} perfect ‘laboratory for observation’. The most significant development trends in the post-socialist countries are population decline and increasing spatial inequalities that started soon after the reforms. Of all the post-socialist countries, it is Lithuania that stands out the most, experiencing an extreme drop in population (Eurostat, 2017; United Nations, 2015). Since the 1990 s, it has lost more than 20 percent of the population, which makes it one of the world’s fastest shrinking countries. Furthermore, in Lithuania in the socialist period, planning policy focused on decentralisation and sought to limit the growth of the major cities (Enyedi, 1998; Šešelgis, 1996; Vanagas, Krišjane, Noorkoiv, & Staniūnas, 2002). Now most of the economic growth and demographic potential is concentrated in a few metropolitan regions, particularly in Vilnius (Burneika & Ubareviciene, 2015; Cirtautas, 2013; Krupickaitė, 2014; Ubarevičienė & Burneika, 2015; Ubarevičienė, Burneika, & Kriaučiūnas, 2011). Extreme population decline and uneven spatial development can be seen as a threat to the economic and social stability of Lithuania. Despite the fact that significant socio-spatial transformations have been occurring for three decades in Lithuania, they have only recently started to attract greater attention. However, many issues related to socio-spatial development still receive little attention in the scientific and political domains. The aim of this thesis is to gain more insight into the recent socio-spatial transformation processes and their consequences in Lithuania.   This thesis investigates the main features and drivers of socio-spatial change. It shows why we should be concerned, despite the growing economy and improvements in the standard of living, as Lithuania is facing major challenges related to extreme population decline and increasing socio-spatial inequality. The results of this study provide a better understanding of the development processes and reveal how the Soviet-designed socio-spatial structures adapted to a market economy environment. This thesis contributes to the existing literature by investigating population decline, migration patterns, processes of segregation and increasing regional inequalities. While the focus is on Lithuania, the results of this study are also of value for other CEE countries, many of which have experienced similar trajectories of change during recent decades.   This thesis focuses on four areas of social-spatial change: population decline, shifting residential patterns, social segregation and increasing regional inequalities. These processes characterised Lithuania in the recent decades. Firstly, due to its exceptional geopolitical situation (the experience of a shift from the Soviet Union to the EU) and, secondly, due to the <b>specific</b> <b>legacy</b> of Soviet planning policy...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the impact of a Sports Mega Event (SME), the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympics Games, and the <b>specific</b> <b>legacy</b> objective that was set to increase grass-root sports participation. This research aimed to investigate the leveraging processes that were used to try to achieve this objective, through National Governing Bodies (NGBs) who were outlined by Sport England (SE) as the main delivery agent to support the participation initiatives associated to the London 2012 Games (Sport England, 2008). Through the community sports delivery system, NGBs have a network of Voluntary Sports Clubs (VSCs) that were utilised as the main delivery agents across the country. The theory of policy implementation was applied to investigate the processes and practices involved for these organisations both 'top down' (NGBs) and 'bottom up' (VSCs), to better understand their attitudes and experiences surrounding the London 2012 Games. Governance of sports organisations is highly correlated to the process of policy implementation within NGBs and their associated networks. The top-down and bottom-up implementation processes, mirror the modification within the governance literature, through an attrition of governmental power, policy delivery and governance shifted towards a bottom-up approach through partnerships and networks (Bevir and Rhodes, 2006; Grix, 2010). This was investigated through two main studies, firstly through a multi case study design, with four non-popular English sports. This study took a bottom-up approach, in which 32 interviews were undertaken primarily with the VSCs (n= 25), the delivery agents of the participation objective, then additionally with NGB head office staff (n= 7) to investigate their opinions of the legacy implementation process within their sport surrounding the legacy objectives. The significance of investigating these non-popular sports, related to the distinctive opportunity that a home Olympic and Paralympic Games provided them. The second study involved a top-down analysis with NGB senior managers, to gain an insight into how they perceive SMEs and the impact this had on leveraging and implementation strategies, which aimed to increase sports participation. An exploratory, in-depth, mixed method online survey was conducted post London 2012 and 105 responses were received from NGB senior and regional managers. These responses accounted for 37 out of 46 Sport England funded sports producing an extensive representative sample within the sector. This provided a more comprehensive understanding of the sports delivery system and the elements that are involved in legacy production. Results provided new insights into the specific attitudes and significant role that these key stakeholders involved with the legacy production process have, which up to this point has been missing within the academic discourse. Across both studies issues surrounding communication, VSC engagement and attitudes were noted, relating to the importance of building partnerships at both a national and local level and the benefits of social media as a leveraging strategy. Principally, NGBs need to ensure they involve Voluntary Sports Clubs (VSCs) in the SMEs planning stages and the current top-down implementation process is leading to a fragmented delivery system. To limit this, NGBs need to develop a clearer understanding of their VSCs characteristics across their network, as findings highlighted the negative feelings and misuse of some clubs, reducing the efficiency of legacy creation. Thus, by allowing flexibility for informal legacies to emerge and by providing support to VSC stakeholders that may need up-skilling, the SMEs can be capitalised on effectively. Results highlighted that external media had a greater impact on participation and interest, than individual participation programmes for VSCs. Valuable findings emerged throughout the thesis and resulted in beneficial recommendations for future SMEs hosts. Critical Realism (CR) was used as a guiding philosophical perspective to aid understanding and analysis of leveraging and legacy conceptualisation...|$|E

40|$|Problems in {{defining}} and studying religion {{are well known}} to us. What we might identify as a <b>specific</b> European <b>legacy,</b> now exported globally, could be more radically challenged by concerted efforts to respond to alternatives more positively and more robustly. This article identifies some problems {{for the study of}} religions: not only an inherited definition that privatises religion as "belief" but also a theological legacy that encourages scholarly ambitions to divine objectivity. In setting out alternatives, I propose that starting "elsewhere" will be helpful. Studies of material, performative, vernacular and lived religion establish some rich possibilities. A reconsideration of Maori tapu /taboo protocols may demonstrate the value of retheorising "religion" beginning "elsewhere" than the still normative refrain of "belief and practice" encourages. In order to more radically indicate the problems of dominant scholarly approaches (rather than solely definitional issues) I say a little about "witchery" in South Africa and the difficulties of knowing how to respond as a scholar of religion. My argument is that we must change our approaches because we have changed our definitions...|$|R
