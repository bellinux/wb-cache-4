50|$|There {{are various}} {{reactions}} patients experience to having spacers placed between their teeth. If {{the patient has}} a relatively small amount of space between their molars (or none at all), then the spacer may irritate the nerves in the gum of the mouth, causing constant pain. In some cases the spacer digs into the gums, causing bleeding and swelling; and would be more uncomfortable than the actual braces. An orthodontist may advise the patient to drink cold drinks or to eat ice cream, producing a similar, although less efficient and <b>short-lasting</b> <b>effect.</b> Spacers are usually painful, although pain relievers can alleviate the pain if needed. Depending on {{the placement of the}} patient's teeth, spacers may not hurt when first applied, then start to hurt after some time, or they may immediately start to hurt. Depending on the type, spacers may cause pain while chewing, making certain foods (usually those that are tough or crispy) difficult to eat. Some people may also experience a sensation similar to having loose milk teeth. Brushing will not cause spacers to be displaced and regular, if not more, brushing while spacers are in place is encouraged.|$|E

To date, pharmacological treatments for AD have limited and <b>short-lasting</b> <b>effects.</b> Therefore, researchers are investigating novel therapies such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) to treat memory impairment and to reduce or stop the progression of it. Clinical and preclinical studies have been performed and stimulations of the fornix, entorhinal cortex and nucleus basalis of Meynert have been carried out. The results of these studies suggest that DBS {{has the potential to}} enhance memory functions in patients and animal models. The mechanisms underlying memory enhancement may include the release of specific neurotransmitters and neuroplasticity. Some authors suggest that DBS might even be disease-modifying. Nevertheless, it is still premature to conclude that DBS can be used in the treatment of AD, and the field will wait for the results of ongoing clinical trials. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Subjects performed letter-string tasks of high vs. low perceptual load (Lavie, N. (1995). Perceptual load as {{a necessary condition for}} selective attention. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Perfomance. 21, 451 – 468.), while ignoring task-irrelevant celebrity faces. Memory for the faces was then assessed using (a) a surprise recognition test for the celebrities' names, and (b) repetition priming in a face familiarity task. The load manipulation strongly influenced explicit recognition memory, but had no effect on repetition priming from the same items. Moreover, faces from the high load condition produced the same amount of priming whether they were explicitly remembered or not. This result resolves a long-standing anomaly in the {{face recognition}} literature, and is discussed in relation to covert processing in prosopagnosia...|$|R
40|$|It is {{notoriously}} {{difficult to predict}} the behaviour of a complex self-organizing system, where the interactions among dynamical units form a heterogeneous topology. Even if the dynamics of each microscopic unit is known, a real understanding of {{their contributions to the}} macroscopic system behaviour is still lacking. Here we develop information-theoretical methods to distinguish the contribution of each individual unit to the collective out-of-equilibrium dynamics. We show that for a system of units connected by a network of interaction potentials with an arbitrary degree distribution, highly connected units have less impact on the system dynamics as compared to intermediately connected units. In an equilibrium setting, the hubs are often found to dictate the long-term behaviour. However, we find both analytically and experimentally that the instantaneous states of these units have a <b>short-lasting</b> <b>effect</b> on the state trajectory of the entire system. We present qualitative evidence of this phenomenon from empirical findings about a social network of product recommendations, a protein-protein interaction network, and a neural network, suggesting that it might indeed be a widespread property in nature.

40|$|How a firm {{utilizes}} {{technological innovation}} to improve operations management {{is an important}} research question in today's knowledge economy but lacks empirical evidence in the literature. We use a dataset of all non-service U. S. public firms from 1976 to 2005 to examine how a firm's innovation performance is associated with its inventory turnover performance. In particular, we measure a firm's innovation performance by the ratio of its patents (either citations or counts) to its research and development (R&D) expenditure. Our fixed-effect panel regression results indicate a positive relation between innovation performance and inventory turnover ratio, and such a relation varies across industries. By differentiating process and product innovation according to patent usages, we find that process innovation has a consistent and long-lasting effect, whereas product innovation has an immediate but <b>short-lasting</b> <b>effect.</b> We also find supporting evidence for industry spillovers by showing that firms in a more innovative industry are likely to better manage their inventory performance. Our results confirm the benefit of using innovation in logistics and operations management and point to the strategic importance of integrating technology and operations management. postprin...|$|E
40|$|Stress urinary {{incontinence}} {{is a highly}} prevalent disorder resulting from weak urethral closure mechanisms. Endoscopic injection of a urethral bulking agent (UBA) under the urethral mucosa increases coaptation, which improves continence. Collagen is an efficient agent, although its effects are limited in time. Other materials still suffer either from a <b>short-lasting</b> <b>effect</b> or migration in distant organs. We evaluated here novel UBAs using an ex vivo model, with respect to criteria of ease of injection, ability to form a high and stable tissue bulking, implant elasticity and tissue reaction. One approach involves solutions of polymers in water-miscible organic solvents that precipitates in situ. In this manner, high and stable bulks were routinely obtained using various commercial polymers. Selected solvents reduced the tissue reaction to the implant. Microsphere suspensions in hydrogels also proved to be efficient UBA, although less stable bulks were obtained. Thermosetting chitosan hydrogels showed promising results with respect to bulk stability and isoelasticity with surrounding tissues. Different strategies have thus been compared and optimised ex vivo. Further experiments are required to compare the ability of these materials to induce a sustained in vivo bulking effect...|$|E

In laboratory bioassays against Culex quinquefasciatus, biological formulations Vectobac 12 AS and Teknar 3000 (Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis) as well as ABG 6262 (B. sphaericus 2362), both in liquid and powder form, were highly effective. Locally produced B. thuringiensis israelensis, formulations also yielded good results. Among chemical larvicides, pyrethroid compounds Pirisa and K-Othrine yielded better results than the organophosphates Lebaycid and Abate. These last formulations yielded responses ten weaker than predicted in other studies. Under field conditions, a dose of 1250 mg/m 2 for biological formulations was considered adequate for routine application because at this level it is possible to overcome physical influences on results. Only B. sphaericus preparations caused important disruption of mosquito colonization in active breeding sites. Up to 39 weeks were tabulated without complete colonization in natural conditions and one month in artificially colonized tanks. This study suggests that biological alternatives should be considered in mosquito control programs.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Intra-articular drug {{delivery}} systems still suffer from too <b>short-lasting</b> <b>effects.</b> Magnetic particles {{retained in the}} joint using an external magnetic field might prolong the local release of an anti-inflammatory drug. For the purpose, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) and dexamethasone 21 -acetate (DXM) were co-encapsulated into biodegradable microparticles. METHODS: Poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) microparticles embedding both SPIONs and DXM were prepared by a double emulsion technique. The formulation was optimized in two steps, a screening design and a full factorial design, aiming at 10 -microm particle diameter and high DXM encapsulation efficacy. RESULTS: The most significant parameters were the polymer concentration, the stirring speed during solvent extraction and the extractive volume. Increasing the polymer concentration from 200 to 300 mg ml(- 1), both the microparticle mean diameter and the DXM encapsulation efficacy increased up to 12 microm and 90 %, respectively. The microparticles could be retained with an external magnet of 0. 8 T placed at 3 mm. Faster DXM release was obtained for smaller microparticles. CONCLUSION: The experimental set-up offered the tools for tailoring a formulation with magnetic retention properties and DXM release patterns corresponding to the required specifications for intra-articular administration...|$|R

OBJECTIVE: In this randomized controlled study, we tested the effects of robot-assisted gait training (RAGT) and compared it to conventional physiotherapy, measuring walking ability, depression, fatigue, and QoL in patients with progressive MS and severe gait disability. METHODS: Fifty-two participants (Expanded Disability Status Scale score 6 - 7) completed the study protocol. They received two sessions/week over 6 weeks of RAGT or conventional walking therapy. Outcome measures were Six-Minute Walk Test, Ten-Meter Walk Test, Timed Up and Go Test, Berg Balance Scale, Fatigue Severity Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire, and Short Form 36. They were performed pre-treatment, post-treatment, and at 3 months. RESULTS: Walking endurance (p < 0. 01) and balance (p < 0. 01) were improved among those in the RAGT group. Positive effects on depression in both treatment groups were highlighted. However, only among those in the RAGT group was perceived physical functioning QoL increased. No significant effects on fatigue were found. CONCLUSION: RAGT is a treatment option in progressive MS patients with severe gait impairments to induce <b>short-lasting</b> <b>effects</b> on mobility and QoL...|$|R
40|$|Monetary {{authorities}} of many open economies have been regularly intervening in foreign exchange markets {{for years to}} limit volatility in exchange rates and/or push exchange rates back to some desired level. Such interventions have taken the form of actual and oral official interventions. Review of studies investigating the effectiveness of interventions reveals one major issue, related to the assumption that interventions are mostly sterilized. This assumption might lead to unreliable results when changes in interest rates and interventions are both used as explanatory variables for exchange rates. One major consistent finding is that intervention has a significant but <b>short-lasting</b> <b>effect</b> on exchange rates. Studies have reached this conclusion by investigating whether intervention has been effective in turning around the exchange rate over the few days, weeks or months following intervention(s). Only {{a few studies have}} investigated and provided evidence that intervention has been effective in limiting long swings in exchange rates. Studies testing for the effectiveness of interventions specifically through the signaling channel also provide evidence on the importance of macroeconomic variables for exchange rates. The significance of official intervention and official communication for exchange rate movements combined with the importance of macroeconomic variables for exchange rates provide a role for official intervention and parity announcement to influence exchange rate movements and limit the magnitude of exchange rate swings. ...|$|E

However, these approaches have limitations ranging from a <b>short-lasting</b> <b>effect</b> to angioma formation. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of using adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors to deliver VEGF genes to mouse myocardium. A cytomegalovirus promoter was used to drive genes for a human VEGF isoform, VEGF 165, and LacZ. A mouse myocardial ischemic model was generated by ligation of the anterior descending coronary artery. Approximately 1011 copies of the AAV-VEGF vector mixed with 1010 copies of AAV-LacZ were injected to one site of normal myocardium and a total of 1011 copies of AAV-VEGF were injected to multiple sites of myocardium around the ischemic region. LacZ gene expression was observed up to 3 months after the vector inoculation. After AAV-VEGF inoculation, neoangiogenesis was observed in the ischemic heart model but not in normal heart tissue. An inflammatory-cell infiltration was not observed in the AAV-VEGF- and AAV-LacZ-inoculated hearts, and angioma-like structure was not observed. These results indicated that injection of the AAV vector directly to myocardium could mediate efficient gene transfer and transgene expression and that VEGF gene delivered by AAV vector can induce angiogenesis in ischemic myocardium...|$|E

This expectation {{may or may not}} convert into an abnormal return. My dissertation identifies this abnormal return and attempts to verify the significance of the same in the short-term. Whether the abnormal returns are significant to the announcement of the merger, determines the success of the merger in the short-term. Though there are many variables involved in determining the overall success of any merger, the immediate market reaction is sufficient to establish a criterion for success. I have chosen cross-border mergers between the Indian acquiring companies and European target companies as the basis of my study. The Indian M&As market is growing at a remarkable speed and has good future prospects. The lack of research on cross-border M&As in India makes my study an interesting addition to the existing literature. An interesting fact that emerged from this study is the significant abnormal gain before the announcement of merger. This indicates the probability of insider trading in the Indian stock markets. This study shows that the announcement effect has a very <b>short-lasting</b> <b>effect</b> and the abnormal gains are only seen {{on the day of the}} announcement. This study also reveals that shareholders do gain abnormal returns around the date of the announcement. However, this gain is due to the price pressure effect and not the announcement effect...|$|E
40|$|Cognitive bias {{modification}} {{has recently}} been discussed as a possible intervention for mental disorders. A specific form of this novel treatment approach is approach-avoidance modification. In order to examine the efficacy of approach-avoidance modification for positive stimuli associated with social anxiety, we recruited 43 individuals with social anxiety disorder and randomly assigned them to a training (implicit training to approach smiling faces) or a control (equal approach and avoidance of smiling faces) condition in three sessions {{over the course of}} a 1 -week period. Dependent measures included clinician ratings, self-report measures of social anxiety, and overt behavior during behavioral approach tasks. No group differences in any of the outcome measures were observed after training. In addition, while individuals in the training group showed increased approach tendency in one of the sessions, this effect was inconsistent across the three sessions and did not result in long-term changes in implicit approach tendencies between the groups over the course of the entire study. These results suggest that approach-avoidance modification might result in <b>short-lasting</b> <b>effects</b> on implicit approach tendencies towards feared positive stimuli, but this modification may not result in meaningful behavioral change or symptom reduction in individuals with social anxiety disorder...|$|R
40|$|Central {{injection}} of the tachykinins (TKs) neurokinin A (NKA), eledoisin (ELE), and kassinin (KASS) produced long-lasting inhibition (up to 6 h) of drinking induced by subcutaneous hypertonic NaCl, while substance P (SP) and physalaemin (PHYS) evoked <b>short-lasting</b> <b>effects.</b> The hypothesis that water retention or increased Na+ excretion by the kidney (induced by TKs) {{may reduce the}} need for water ingestion was tested. The results obtained both in urine collection experiments and in nephrectomized rats showed that the duration of the effect of NKA, ELE, and KASS is not due to water retention or increased Na+ excretion by the kidney. The effect of NKA, but not that of ELE and KASS, was shortened by nephrectomy, even though NKA did not modify urine volume or Na+ excretion. Indomethacin pretreatment, like nephrectomy, reduced the duration of the NKA effect, suggesting that renal prostaglandins are involved in it. On the other hand, the long-lasting effect of the three TKs cannot be easily explained in terms of slow metabolic degradation, particularly for NKA. Alternatively, it might be hypothesized that these TKs produce a modification of osmoreceptor function lasting well beyond the life of the peptide, and/or that they produce Na+ loss through emunctories different from the kidney...|$|R
40|$|The {{formalin}} {{test was used}} to measure the analgesia induced by restraint in male and female rats. Animals were restrained for 30 min or left undisturbed in their cage and then (1) killed immediately to collect blood for hormonal determinations; or (2) subcutaneously injected with formalin in the hind paw (or sham-injected), introduced to an open field for recording of behaviour, and killed {{at the end of this}} procedure. In both experiments, corticosterone was found to be higher in females. In Experiment 1, the ability of restraint to be stressful was confirmed by the increase in corticosterone in both sexes and by the decrease of testosterone in males. In Experiment 2, restraint-treatment induced a reduction in licking and flexing that was limited to the second phase. The reduction occurred in different periods and to a different degree in the two sexes; it was greater in females. Spontaneous behaviours showed sex differences in restraint-treated but not in formalin-treated animals. The results show that the hormonal effects observed after restraint are not present after the {{formalin test}} and that the marked analgesia observed with phasic painful stimuli does not occur with a longer-lasting one such as that induced by formalin, after which only partial and <b>short-lasting</b> <b>effects</b> were observed...|$|R

Hereditary Spastic Paraparesis (HSP) is a rare neurodegenerative disease causing spasticity and paresis of the lower limbs, as well as impairments in gait and balance. Physical therapy {{is one of the}} recommended interventions to manage the condition. Research on this field of expertise is scarce, indicating an area within neurological physical therapy that has been neglected and was in need for further examination. The informants highlighted how community-based physical therapy is characterized by passive strategies, mainly stretching of affected musculature, with has non or <b>short-lasting</b> <b>effect</b> on experienced stiffness. Moving in full range of motion (ROM) was perceived as important of preventing limited mobility in the lower extremities. The least affected informants often included full ROM as a part of active exercise or self-stretching exercises, while the most affected depended on manual stretching by the physical therapist. Intensive activity in weight-bearing positions and with good movement quality is the preferred interventions to maintain function and slow down progression, reflecting aspects of the possibility of motor learning an positive neuromuscular plasticity. It was conducted a part of self-initiated exercise or during in-patient rehabilitation stays in specialist health care. A good interpersonal relationship with the therapist is weighted as important for a positive experience with physical therapy and to maintain motivation to continue. Furthermore, informants report lack of knowledge regarding HSP at local therapists, as well as limitations in availability in both community-based and specialist heath care. This have an impact on both the quality and amount of physical treatment.

40|$|Pain {{perception}} {{and the response}} to opioid analgesics are determined {{by a number of}} factors, among which genetic variability and the activation of the NMDA-receptor for glutamate play an important role. The effects of two clinically available NMDA-receptor antagonists, ketamine (KET) and dextromethorphan (DEX), were evaluated on an animal model of acute nociception, the hot plate test, and on human experimental acute ischemic pain. Neither KET nor DEX induced antinociception, but potentiated morphine (MO) in the animal model. KET combined with MO had a <b>short-lasting</b> <b>effect,</b> whereas DEX induced a dose-dependent, long lasting potentiation of MO in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. In human experimental ischemic pain, continuous intravenous infusion of KET induced significant analgesia, while oral DEX had no effect. Neither of the two drugs had any influence on MO analgesia in humans. The role of genetic factors in pain modulation and the effects of opioid analgesics was studied in four rat strains: SD, Wistar-Kyoto (WK), Spontaneously Hypertensive (SHR) and Dark-Agouti (DA). Significant differences were found in the nociceptive threshold, the response to morphine, development of tolerance and the effect of DEX on MO antinociception among the animal strains. Genetic differences in the development of peripheral neuropathy following unilateral sciatic nerve ischemia were assessed in SD rats from different vendors (BK-SD and DK-SD), SHR, WK and DA rats. Significant variations were found not only in the pain behaviors, but also in the extent of morphological damage in the sciatic nerve, which was less in DAs compared with the other strains. DK-SD showed a rapid development and consistent hyperalgesia on both the injured and the non-injured side ("mirror pain"-like phenomenon). This substrain was further used for evaluating the effect of methadone, an opioid with NMDA-receptor blocking properties, on this peripheral neuropathy in rats. Methadone in single dose administration showed a comparable effect with MO on pain-like behaviors on the lesioned side, but had a more consistent effect on the contralateral side and it also exerted longer-lasting antinociception in all tests. NMDA-receptor antagonists can induce antinociception/analgesia and potentiate the effect of opioids, but the route of administration and the specific pharmacokinetic profile of each drug are essential factors in order to achieve optimal outcome with reduced adverse effects. Genetic traits {{have a significant impact on}} pain-like behaviors, the effects of drugs on acute nociception and in the development of peripheral neuropathy and these factors are important to be taken into account in both pain research and clinical conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{discovery}} of the ocular hypotensive effect of topically applied prostaglandins (PGs) has raised {{a number of questions}} about the mechanisms of action involved. The aim of the present thesis was to answer some of these questions. PGs reduce the intraocular pressure (IOP) by increasing uveoscleral flow through the ciliary muscle, but the exact mechanism is not known. Morphological changes may be involved. PGs are also involved in the inflammatory response. In the first study the aim was to investigate the effect of latanoprost, a prostaglandin F 2 a-analogue, on the blood-aqueous barrier and the IOP restoration after long-term treatment. 26 glaucoma patients were treated with latanoprost (50 pg/ml) once daily for 6 - 12 months. Aqueous protein concentration was followed with a laser flare meter in 16 patients throughout this period. No change was observed. IOP increased slowly after withdrawal of treatment. It was concluded that latanoprost has no clinically significant effect on the permeability of the blood-aqueous barrier and that the IOP will return to pretreatment levels within a few weeks, indicating that any changes in the ciliary muscle morphology are reversible. In 20 healthy volunteers it was attempted to prevent the ocular hypotensive effect of latanoprost by inhibiting uveoscleral flow by a pronounced ciliary muscle contraction. For this purpose a high dose of the cholinergic agonist, physostigmine (1 drop 8 mg/ml alternate hours) was used. However, the effects on IOP of the two drugs were mainly additive most likely due to a <b>short-lasting</b> <b>effect</b> of physostigmine on the ciliary muscle. The progressive IOP reduction by physostigmine in the second study raised the question as to whether the drug reduces aqueous flow apart from enhancing outflow. On the contrary, in the third study repeated administrations of physostigmine, in 20 normal subjects, increased aqueous flow, measured with fluorophotometry, by about 25 %. From studies of patients it is known that latanoprost twice daily has less ocular hypotensive effect than once daily. This was the subject of the two remaining studies. The possibility that latanoprost causes a short-lasting increase in aqueous flow was examined in 18 healthy volunteers. Application of a second drop in the morning would blunt some of the early IOP lowering effect of latanoprost. Once or twice daily applications had similar effect on aqueous flow, a tendency to an increase without any difference between the dose regimens. The next study confirmed the difference in effect on IOP between once and twice daily applications in 40 normal subjects. The difference remained even when one of the two applications was omitted after two weeks’ treatment. The results indicate that applying latanoprost twice daily induces a modest receptor desensitisation. Diss. Umeå : Umeå universitet, 1997, härtill 5 uppsatser. digitalisering@um...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background: Williams-Beuren {{syndrome}} (WBS) {{is a rare}} {{genetic disorder}} caused by the deletion of 26 - 28 genes on chromosome 7. Fifteen percent of WBS patients present with hypercalcaemia during infancy, which is generally mild and resolves spontaneously {{before the age of}} 4 years. The mechanisms underlying the transient hypercalcaemia in WBS are poorly understood. Case: We report a case of severe symptomatic hypercalcaemia in a patient with WBS, in which treatment with mild calcium restriction, hyperhydration and repeated bisphosphonate administration only resulted in <b>short-lasting</b> <b>effects.</b> Long-term lowering of serum calcium was only achieved after reducing calcium and vitamin D intake to the bare minimum. Conclusions: This case illustrates the potential severity of hypercalcaemia in WBS, and demonstrates that both the cause as well as the solution of this problem may be found in the intestinal absorption of calcium. We hypothesise that the phenotypical resemblance between WBS and transient idiopathic infantile hypercalcaemia can be explained by similarities in the underlying genetic defect. Patients suffering from transient infantile hypercalcaemia were recently described to have mutations in CYP 24 A 1, the key enzyme in 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 degradation. In the light of this new development we discuss the role of one of the deleted genes in WBS, Williams syndrome transcription factor (WSTF), in the etiology of hypercalcaemia in WBS...|$|R
40|$|Glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa {{receptor}} inhibitors before primary angioplasty {{in patients}} with ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) are recommended by current guidelines. Thus, {{an increasing number of}} patients receive these drugs before coronary angiography, particularly if a between-hospital transfer is needed. However, when coronary anatomy is unsuitable for angioplasty, emergency coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) under GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor treatment may be needed, with a potential increase in bleeding risk. Abciximab has a long duration of action, because of its high-affinity binding to GP IIb/IIIa receptors. Initial retrospective studies reported a higher incidence of major bleeding during emergency CABG after abciximab administration, leading to the recommendation of delaying surgery > 12 h. However, data from the prospective trials on abciximab do not confirm the increase in bleeding risk, and current evidence shows that emergency surgery can be performed safely soon after abciximab cessation. Monitoring of activated clotting time during surgery and platelet transfusion in case of postoperative relevant bleeding are the only measures needed. No data are available on emergency surgery {{in patients with}} STEMI treated with eptifibatide or tirofiban. However, their <b>short-lasting</b> <b>effects</b> and the results of trials on non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes suggest that they could even reduce postoperative bleeding by preventing platelet consumption during cardiopulmonary bypass.

40|$|Functional {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (fMRI) activation detection within stimulus-based experimental paradigms is conventionally {{based on the assumption}} that activation effects remain constant over time. This assumption neglects the fact that the strength of activation may vary, for example, due to habituation processes or changing attention. Neither the functional form of time variation can be retrieved nor <b>short-lasting</b> <b>effects</b> can be detected by conventional methods. In this work, a new dynamic approach is proposed that allows to estimate time-varying effect profiles and hemodynamic response functions in event-related fMRI paradigms. To this end, we incorporate the time-varying coefficient methodology into the fMRI general regression framework. Inference is based on a voxelwise penalized least squares procedure. We assess the strength of activation and corresponding time variation on the basis of pointwise confidence intervals on a voxel level. Additionally, spatial clusters of effect curves are presented. Results of the analysis of an active oddball experiment show that activation effects deviating from a constant trend coexist with time-varying effects that exhibit different types of shapes, such as linear, (inversely) U-shaped or fluctuating forms. In a comparison to conventional approaches, like classical SPM, we observe that time-constant methods are rather insensitive to detect temporary effects, because these do not emerge when aggregated across the entire experiment. Hence, it is recommended to base activation detection analyses not merely on time-constant procedures but to include flexible time-varying effects that harbour valuable information on individual response patterns.

40|$|Obesity and its {{associated}} complications are a significant health problem in industrialized countries. This fact has generated great interest {{in the role of}} the gut in the regulation of food intake in the past three decades. Especially after the discoveries of gastrin, secretin and cholecystokinin (CCK), it was generally accepted that digestive processes are mainly regulated by hormones, but it has become apparent that there is a complex interplay between neural and hormonal pathways. Several systems seem to be involved in the regulation of bodyweight; one of them is primarily concerned with short-term regulation of food intake. The control circuits include central and peripheral signals. Much insight has been gained into physiological processes of satiety peptides like CCK, glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) and peptide tyrosine-tyrosine (PYY) in the past few years. The informations depicting their mechanism of action and potential interactions between different physiological signals involved in the short-term regulation of satiety are still limited in humans. The main interest of this thesis focuses on the further characterization of some of those signals, especially on the investigation in potential interactions between individual satiety factors. The study set-up applied in the projects was standardized and is similar to experimental conditions used in prior studies. Here are some examples: nearly in every study, volunteers received an intraduodenal (ID) perfusion. To investigate a potential interaction between the stomach and the small intestine, a preload was given or the stomach was distended by a balloon for a short period of time before the test meal was offered. After the preload or the distension of the stomach, a standard meal was presented to the subjects, and they were invited to eat and drink as much as they wished for 60 min. During the study subjects scored their subjective feelings for hunger and fullness for the duration of each experiment using a visual analogue scale (VAS) and blood was drawn in regular intervals. The study was finished 60 min after meal start. The stomach has an obvious role in the regulation of eating behavior, but until recently it was still unclear, if and to what extent pure mechanical distension of the fundus and the antrum can influence food intake. Therefore the first project was designed to further understand the role of a) the gastric fundus and b) the gastric antrum in triggering satiation in healthy male volunteers. From previous study results it was anticipated that distension of the distal stomach could play a role in the generation of satiation. In the first part of our study the fundus was distended by a balloon with increasing volumes. When the fundus was distended, no effect on food intake was observed, but a <b>short-lasting</b> <b>effect</b> on feelings of hunger and fullness. Gastric distension only seems to trigger satiety as long as mechanoreceptors in the stomach are stimulated; the <b>short-lasting</b> <b>effect</b> could indicate that the signals are transmitted via afferent nerves to the central nervous system (CNS). The second part of this study was designed to examine the effect of antrum balloon distension on subsequent food intake; in addition, it was of interest to test whether ID fat could intensify the effect of distal gastric distension. Neither gastric distension alone nor in combination with ID fat reduced the subsequent calorie intake; also no effect was observed on feelings of hunger or fullness. ID fat does not seem to intensify gastric satiety signals induced by pure mechanical distension of the stomach. Neither fundus nor antrum distension altered CCK and PYY plasma concentrations. This fact implies that signals induced by pure mechanical gastric distension are not mediated by circulating CCK or PYY. During ID fat perfusion, CCK and PYY plasma concentrations were significantly increased. The increase of CCK after ID fat confirmed previous study results. However, this study was one of the first which could show an increase of PYY after ID fat in humans. Due to these study results pure mechanical gastric distension of the fundus or the antrum is presumably not a sufficient satiety signal to influence subsequent food intake. An interaction effect on food intake resulting from an intestinal and a gastric satiety signal was already explored for CCK, but not for GLP- 1. It was therefore of interest to find out whether an interaction exists between a preload and intravenous (i. v.) GLP- 1. In the second project GLP- 1 was given i. v. in a dose which mimics physiological GLP- 1 plasma concentrations; the dose reduced calorie intake confirming previous study results. One major observation of this study was the demonstration that a protein-containing preload together with i. v. GLP- 1 enhanced the satiety-inducing effects of GLP- 1 compared to a water preload plus infusion of GLP- 1. This result provides strong evidence that GLP- 1 interacts with gastric signals to modulate food intake and satiety in humans. We inferred that GLP- 1 is an important satiety factor which interacts with other satiety signals in order to control food intake and satiety. However, it still remains unclear whether the satiety effects of GLP- 1 are directly mediated through peripheral or central receptors or indirectly by releasing other satiety peptides. The following study was designed to further understand the potential interaction between protein and fat in regulating food intake in humans. It is known that ID lipid infusions and protein given as an oral preload reduce food intake in humans and from previous study results we inferred that ID fat interacts with gastric signals to regulate food intake. In the third project we were interested in exploring the potential interaction of the stomach and the small intestine; we also wanted to see whether GLP- 1 and PYY are associated with this interaction. ID fat perfusion alone reduced the amount of food eaten and the total calorie intake, but the reduction did not reach statistical significance. Although the design of the present study was similar to previous studies with respect to fat dose, experimental design and duration of fat perfusion, the variability of the individual responses to ID fat was greater than in previous studies and the reduction of food intake did not reach statistical significance. Due to these results it can be speculated that certain individuals have a reduced sensation to ID fat. The effects of ID fat on food intake do not seem to be mediated by changes in plasma GLP- 1 or PYY levels, but they are largely dependent on CCK release, which is in agreement with previous findings. When subjects consumed an oral protein preload, calorie intake was significantly reduced. The increase of premeal plasma concentrations of GLP- 1 and PYY did not differ compared to placebo. Therefore the inhibitory effect of oral protein on eating behavior is not mediated by changes in circulating plasma hormone levels. The simultaneous administration of an oral protein preload and ID fat did not show a synergistic reduction in calorie consumption, rejecting the hypothesis that oral protein and ID fat exert a positive synergistic effect. The fourth project examined the physiological and the pharmacological role of PYY in regulating eating behavior. Due to human study results it was supposed that PYY (3 - 36) is a potent physiological regulator of satiety with a potential for therapeutic application. Because the physiological role of PYY in humans has not been investigated in detail, we first wanted to define a range of physiological PYY plasma levels after two meals differing in their calorie content. The results showed that only large meals are able to stimulate the release of larger amounts of PYY, whereas a low-calorie meal has minimal effects on postprandial hormone plasma levels. In the second part of the study we wanted to examine the effects of graded doses of i. v. PYY (3 - 36) on eating behavior in healthy human subjects. We found a dose-dependent satiety effect of i. v. applied PYY (3 - 36). These results support the hypothesis that exogenously administrated PYY (3 - 36) is able to suppress food intake in humans. However, when the postprandial physiological levels of PYY after the high calorie meal are compared to those obtained after peripheral administration, it can be suggested that the significant satiety effect of PYY (3 - 36) is only seen at plasma concentrations higher than those after a large meal. The smallest administered dose of PYY (3 - 36) did not significantly reduce food intake and showed PYY plasma levels about in the same range as the physiological ones. Due to these results we infer that the PYY satiety effect seen with the middle and the highest dose of exogenous PYY (3 - 36) was rather a pharmacological than a physiological effect. It seems to be unlikely that PYY is a major physiological satiety factor, but still more information is necessary. Dose-dependent side effects of PYY (3 - 36) like nausea and vomiting could be observed. PYY (3 - 36) seems to have a narrow therapeutic window, which could limit its therapeutic potential. In summary it was shown in the present thesis that 1) pure gastric balloon distension of the fundus and the antrum is not a sufficient satiety signal to influence subsequent food intake; 2) the effect of gastric distension on eating behavior is not amplified by ID fat; 3) GLP- 1 is an important satiety factor and seems to interact with gastric signals to modulate food intake and satiety in humans; 4) the satiating effect of protein as an oral preload cannot be amplified by ID fat; 5) the release of physiological PYY is dependent on the calorie content of a meal; 6) exogenous PYY (3 - 36) reduces food intake in a dose-dependent manner; 7) the effect of exogenous PYY (3 - 36) on food intake seems to be a pharmacological rather than a physiological effect; 8) PYY (3 - 36) has a narrow therapeutic window...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Epidural {{clonidine}} produces analgesia {{without motor}} impairment, and {{is associated with}} a local anesthetic-sparing effect during labor. The authors have recently demonstrated that epidural neostigmine initiates selective labor analgesia devoid of adverse effects. Both drugs possess common analgesic mechanisms mediated through spinal acetylcholine release. This study evaluates their epidural combination in parturients. METHODS: At the beginning of labor, parturients were randomly allocated to one of five groups to receive one of the following after a test dose: 150 microg epidural clonidine, 750 microg neostigmine, or 75 microg clonidine combined with 250, 500, or 750 microg neostigmine. A pain score (visual analog scale, 0 - 100) was recorded before administration and at regular intervals until request for a supplemental injection. Subsequent analgesia was provided by continuous epidural infusion of ropivacaine. RESULTS: Parturients did not differ regarding demographic data and initial pain score. Clonidine 150 microg, neostigmine 750 microg, and 75 microg clonidine plus 250 microg neostigmine produced ineffective and <b>short-lasting</b> <b>effects.</b> Clonidine 75 microg plus 500 microg neostigmine and 75 microg clonidine plus 750 microg neostigmine presented comparable durations of 90 +/- 32 and 108 +/- 38 min (mean +/- SD), respectively, and final analgesic efficacies, with 72. 2 % and 84 %, respectively, of the parturients reporting a visual analog scale score of less than 30 out of 100 after 30 min. Ropivacaine use was significantly reduced in all clonidine groups (average, 9. 5 mg/h) in comparison with neostigmine alone (17 +/- 3 mg/h). No adverse effects were observed for 75 mug clonidine combined with any dose of neostigmine while maternal sedation (20 %) and hypotension (33 %) occurred with 150 microg clonidine alone. CONCLUSIONS: Epidural clonidine, 75 microg, with 750 microg neostigmine is an effective combination to initiate selective labor analgesia without adverse effects. Clonidine use further reduces local anesthetic consumption throughout the course of labor...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{further the}} mechanism of the long duration of action of the selective β 2 -adrenoceptor agonist, salmeterol, we have determined the duration of action of some responses to salmeterol which are not mediated throughβ 2 -adrenoceptors. In the presence of propranolol (1 [*]μM), salmeterol (1 – 30 [*]μM) caused concentration-related relaxation of superfused, pre-contracted strips of guinea-pig gastric fundus. On washing the tissues, these relaxant responses were rapidly lost, the time to 50 % recovery being approximately 30 [*]min. In human neutrophils, salmeterol (1 – 100 [*]μM) caused concentration-related inhibition of FMLP-induced O 2 − release. Propranolol (1 [*]μM) {{had little or no}} effect on the inhibitory activity of salmeterol. Washing the cells twice over a 40 [*]min period caused a marked reduction of the inhibitory activity of salmeterol. In guinea-pig superfused trachea, in the absence of propranolol, infusions of (RS) -salmeterol (10 – 30 [*]nM) and the less potent (S) -enantiomer of salmeterol (300 – 3000 [*]nM) inhibited electrically-induced contractile responses. When the infusion was stopped, there was no recovery from the inhibitory responses within 200 [*]min. In the presence of propranolol (1 [*]μM), infusions of (RS) -salmeterol (10 [*]μM) and (S) -salmeterol (10 – 100 [*]μM) also inhibited the contractile responses, but, in contrast, on stopping the infusions differences were observed in recovery times. Thus no appreciable recovery was observed from the responses to (RS) -salmeterol, whereas a rapid loss of inhibition was observed on stopping the infusion of (S) -salmeterol, the time to 50 % recovery being 30 – 35 [*]min. These relatively <b>short-lasting</b> <b>effects</b> of salmeterol which are not mediated through β 2 -adrenoceptors, contrast with the persistence of the responses which are mediated through β 2 -adrenoceptors seen in a variety of tissues, but are similar to the rate of dissociation of salmeterol observed from artificial membranes. These observations suggest that the sustained agonist activity of salmeterol is peculiar to responses mediated by β 2 -adrenoceptors...|$|R
40|$|Pancreatic {{cancer has}} a very poor {{prognosis}} resulting {{in the death of}} 98 % of patients. Pain may be severe and difficult to treat. Management of pain includes chemotherapy, radiotherapy, pharmacologic treatment, and neurolytic celiac plexus block. Recent reviews of the efficacy of neurolytic celiac plexus block however, have reached conflicting conclusions. In this paper, we present two patients with severe pancreatic cancer pain resistant to pharmacologic treatment. Analgesic effect following repeated neurolytic celiac plexus blocks with alcohol was limited in time. Post-mortem neurohistopathologic examination of the celiac plexus revealed an abnormal celiac architecture with a combination of abnormal neurons with vacuolization and normal looking neuronal structures (ganglionic structures and nerve fibers) embedded in fibrotic hyalinized tissue. Our results show that a neurolytic celiac plexus block with alcohol is capable of partially destroying the celiac plexus. These findings may explain the significant but <b>short-lasting</b> analgesic <b>effect</b> following neurolytic celiac plexus block with alcoho...|$|R
40|$|Ammonia-oxidizing {{bacteria}} {{are able to}} maintain a high oxidizing potential during starvation. Nitrite has a <b>short-lasting</b> stimulatory <b>effect</b> on the oxidation of ammonia after starvation when supplied simultaneously with fresh ammonium 9). To examine whether nitrite-oxidizing bacteria as partners in naturally occurring nitrifying communities interfere with this stimulatory effect of nitrite, mixed culture experiments were performed in sand slurries. Following the consumption of ammonium, these mixed cultures were starved for 4 months in their own medium. After the starvation period, ammonium was supplied. In contrast to the former experiments in monocultures of Nitrosomonas europaea, no short-lasting peak in ammonium oxidation activity was observed {{in the presence of}} nitrite-oxidizing cells. When these nitrite-oxidizing cells had been pre-activated with 5 mM nitrite one week before ammonium was supplied to the starving cultures, ammonia-oxidizing activity was weakened for up to four days, depending on the culture examined. The possibility that ammonia-oxidizing cells are repressed in the presence of nitrite-oxidizing cells in natural environments such as nitrifying biofilms is discussed.

40|$|Background: A five-year citywide {{control program}} based on regular {{application}} of temephos significantly reduced Aedes aegypti larval indices {{but failed to}} maintain them below target levels in Clorinda, northern Argentina. Incomplete surveillance coverage and reduced residuality of temephos were held as the main putative causes limiting effectiveness of control actions. Methodology: The duration of temephos residual effects in household-owned water-holding tanks (the most productive container type and main target for control) was estimated prospectively in two trials. Temephos was applied using spoons or inside perforated small zip-lock bags. Water samples from the study tanks (including positive and negative controls) were collected weekly and subjected to larval mortality bioassays. Water turnover was estimated quantitatively by adding sodium chloride to the study tanks and measuring its dilution 48 hs later. Principal Findings: The median duration of residual effects of temephos applied using spoons (2. 4 weeks) was significantly lower than with zip-lock bags (3. 4 weeks), and widely heterogeneous between tanks. Generalized estimating equations models showed that bioassay larval mortality was strongly affected by water type and type of temephos application depending on water type. Water type and water turnover were highly significantly associated.

40|$|Supraglottic airway {{devices are}} {{routinely}} used for airway maintenance in elective surgical procedures where aspiration {{is not a}} significant risk and also as rescue devices in difficult airway management. Some devices now have features mitigating risk of aspiration, such as drain tubes or compartments to manage regurgitated content. Despite this, {{the use of these}} device may be associated with various complications including aspiration. This review highlights the types and incidence of these complications. They include regurgitation and aspiration of gastric contents, compression of vascular structures, trauma, and nerve injury. The incidence of such complications is quite low, but as some carry with them a significant degree of morbidity the need to follow manufacturers’ advice is underlined. The incidence of gastric content aspiration associated with the devices is estimated to be as low as 0. 02 % with perioperative regurgitation being significantly higher but underreported. Other serious, but extremely rare, complications include pharyngeal rupture, pneumomediastinum, mediastinitis, or arytenoid dislocation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the technical possibilities of placing a catheter near the celiac plexus for performance of a celiac plexus block, and to study the efficacy of repeated neurolytic celiac plexus blocks with alcohol in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer pain resistant to opioid treatment. In 12 patients, a neurolytic celiac plexus block with alcohol, administered via an indwelling celiac catheter, was performed. To evaluate the efficacy, visual analog scale scores were recorded every day. Quality of life scores were registered before and 4 weeks following the procedure. Alterations in opioid consumption, and the time between the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and the performance of the block, were registered. All patients were followed until they died. Two patients remained without pain after the first neurolytic celiac plexus block. In all other patients a second block was administered which provided only temporary relief. Additional intermittent administration of bupivacaine through the catheter was necessary to provide adequate pain relief in these patients. Quality of life increased significantly during the treatment. Opioid consumption decreased significantly in all patients. Our study indicates that a neurolytic celiac plexus blockade with alcohol results in a significant but <b>short-lasting</b> analgesic <b>effect.</b> The use of a celiac catheter improves the long-term management of pancreatic cancer pai...|$|R
40|$|Background: For {{the past}} fifty years part the {{population}} has slowly become sedentary to an extent that it is nowadays considered normal behavior. Parallel with sedentary behavior there is an increase in obesity now reaching epidemic level. Metabolic derangements such as diabetes type 2 and cardiovascular diseases has become an economic burden for the modern society. Implementation of training programs for individuals that have been sedentary for years has often been demonstrated inefficient, with few and <b>short-lasting</b> <b>effects.</b> Aim: The primary aim of this thesis was to study effects of increased physical activity at different intensities in distinct sedentary populations. The secondary aim was to investigate if there was a gender difference in adaption to short-term endurance training. Methodology: Study I: Two hundred and twelve (age 45 - 69 years) sedentary overweight men and women were included. They were classified as normal or impaired glucose tolerance, or diabetes type 2. They were randomized into controls or intervention group. The intervention group was instructed to increase their physical activity by walking with poles (Nordic walking) 5 h per week. Questionnaire, blood samples, anthropometric data and results from an exercise test were collected at baseline and after 4 months. Study II: Fourteen healthy (22 - 30 year-old) sedentary normal weight women and men participated in a 3 weeks endurance training program including 2 supervised sessions per day. The training period was followed by 4 weeks of detraining. Blood samples including total antioxidative capacity (TAOC) and oxidative stress (OS), body composition (BC), anthropometric data and evaluation of work capacity were obtained at baseline, after training and after detraining. Result: Study I: Nordic walking improved waist circumference, body weight and body mass index in the intervention group with normal glucose tolerance. Participants that reported > 80 % adherence to training improved work capacity in terms of work load, VO 2 peak, or both, in all groups. Biochemical markers were unaffected. Study II: TAOC levels decreased significantly in women after training, while no change was noted in men. After training both gender showed increased work load, VO 2 peak even adjusted for fat-free mass, and ventilation. After detraining, work load and VO 2 peak decreased in women. Adjusted VO 2 peak decreased also in men but remained higher compared to baseline. Fat-free mass (kg) was higher after detraining compared to baseline in women. Conclusion: Study I: Nordic walking had positive anthropometric effects among those with normal glucose tolerance. It could be applied in clinical practice, but surveillance of training might be necessary to reach optimal results among sedentary individuals. Study II: Female participants were more sedentary and their exercise capacity improved to a greater degree. Their decrease in TAOC might reflect an increased consumption of antioxidants to prevent negative effects of OS. A higher level of daily regular physical activity in men could explain their maintenance of improved VO 2 peak after detraining...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To study anticonvulsive and antiepileptogenic {{effects of}} singe {{levetiracetam}} (LEV) {{administration in the}} model of audiogenic kindling. Methods: Rats of Krushinsky-Molodkina (KM) strain genetically susceptible to severe audiogenic seizures received one intraperitoneal injection of saline, low (6 mg/kg) or high (50 mg/kg) dose of LEV before or after audiogenic kindling. One hour postinjection, an audiogenic seizure was induced to assess anticonvulsive effect of LEV in nonkindled and kindled rats. To examine antiepileptogenic activity of LEV, nonkindled rats injected with the drug or saline were kindled with repeated sound stimulations. Audiogenic kindling development manifested in an appearance and progressive prolongation of an additional seizure phase, post-tonic–clonus. The latency and duration of audiogenic seizures and the duration of every seizure phase (running, tonic, post-tonic–clonic) were measured. Results: One hour posttreatment, LEV dose-dependently lengthened the latency and reduced the duration of audiogenic seizures in both nonkindled and kindled rats. The seizure shortening resulted from selective suppression of tonic and kindled post-tonic–clonic phases. The dose of 50 mg/kg completely blocked tonic and clonic convulsions 1 h postinjection. The anticonvulsive effect of LEV was more pronounced in kindled than in nonkindled rats. Single LEV injection in the dose of 50 mg/kg prior audiogenic kindling significantly suppressed subsequent kindling progression indicating profound antiepileptogenic potency of the drug. Conclusions: The present study shows that LEV exerts both <b>short-lasting</b> anticonvulsive <b>effect</b> on audiogenic seizures and very long-lasting antiepileptogenic effect on audiogenic kindling. Remarkably, a single injection of LEV is enough to significantly suppress kindling progression in KM rats...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Population-based {{screening}} {{for prostate cancer}} is currently being evaluated in randomized clinical trials in the United States and in Europe. Side effects arising from the process of screening and from the earlier treatment of screen-detected prostate cancer may be important factors in the evaluation. To examine health-related quality of life (or health status) among men screened for prostate cancer, we conducted a longitudinal study of 626 attenders to the Rotterdam (The Netherlands) prostate cancer screening program and of 500 nonparticipants. METHODS: Attenders of the screening program and nonparticipants completed self-assessment questionnaires (SF- 36 [i. e., Medical Outcomes Study 36 -Item Short-Form Health Survey] and EQ- 5 D [i. e., EuroQol measure for health-related quality of life] health surveys) to measure generic health status, {{as well as an}} additional questionnaire for anxiety and items relating to prostate cancer screening. RESULTS: Physical discomfort during digital rectal examination and during transrectal ultrasound was reported by 181 (37 %) of 491 men and by 139 (29 %) of 487 men, respectively; discomfort during prostate biopsy was reported by 64 (55 %) of 116 men. Mean scores for health status and anxiety indicated that the participants did not experience relevant changes in physical, psychological, and social functioning during the screening procedure. However, high levels of anxiety were observed throughout the screening process among men with a high predisposition to anxiety. Similar scores for anxiety predisposition were observed among attenders and nonparticipants.
