2500|$|I'd {{learned to}} read Butler's body {{language}} and he was getting a little nervous as we flew {{deeper and deeper into}} Iraqi territory. The reality of what we were about to do had begun to hit him. Duelfer teased him about how the Iraqis could solve everything if they just shot us out of the sky. Butler was not amused. He kept asking probing questions, reassuring himself that these inspection targets were of a legitimate disarmament character. [...] "What makes us go to that site?" [...] he asked. How do I explain it to the Iraqis?...How do I explain this site to the Security Council?...What do we expect to find at this one?...What happens if the Iraqis <b>stop</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> entering?" ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 21, O'Keefe and Giles {{released}} {{video footage}} of their {{visit to the}} Philadelphia office of ACORN at a National Press Club conference. They claimed it was to show they had received help there, after an ACORN spokesman had said that the pair {{had been asked to}} leave the Philadelphia office. The Washington Post [...] "obtained a July 24 police report that showed police were called when O'Keefe and Giles attempted their sting at ACORN's Philadelphia offices—and that the couple were escorted out of those offices." [...] Susan Kinzie of The Washington Post noted that [...] "the heavily edited footage includes audio of the two conservatives but none of the ACORN Housing Corp. worker's responses to their questions." [...] Junette Marcano, a board member of Philadelphia ACORN, said, [...] "This is a targeted assault to disenfranchise our members because ... the right-wing agenda is to <b>stop</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> empowering people of low and moderate incomes.

5000|$|Living Eyes also {{features}} {{the return of}} Robin and Maurice Gibb as a lead vocalist since 1975 in a whole song.

That's what <b>stopped</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> saying, 'Well it's time Robin had a lead.' But now it's no longer a sales point, it's important that Robin's voice get heard. It's equally important that Maurice's voice gets heard. And it's becoming less important that I get heard. And that's the way we work. There's no ego within the three of us, whoever's singing most or whoever has the most hits is irrelevant." ...|$|R
