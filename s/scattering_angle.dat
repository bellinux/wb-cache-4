Such indexing gives the unit-cell parameters, the lengths and angles of the unit-cell, as well as its space group. Since Bragg's law does not interpret the relative intensities of the reflections, however, it is generally inadequate to solve for the arrangement of atoms within the unit-cell; for that, a Fourier transform method must be carried out.|$|E

25|$|The {{relatively}} flat {{phase curve}} of Venus {{is characteristic of}} a cloudy planet. In contrast to Mercury where the curve is strongly peaked approaching phase angle zero (full phase) that of Venus is rounded. The wide illumination <b>scattering</b> <b>angle</b> of clouds, {{as opposed to the}} narrower scattering of regolith, causes this flattening of the phase curve. Venus exhibits a brightness surge near phase angle 170°, when it is a thin crescent, due to forward scattering of sunlight by droplets of sulfuric acid that are above the planet's cloud tops. Even beyond 170° the brightness does not decline very steeply.|$|E
25|$|Compton {{scattering}} is {{the predominant}} interaction between X-rays and soft tissue in medical imaging. Compton scattering is an inelastic scattering of the X-ray photon by an outer shell electron. Part {{of the energy}} of the photon is transferred to the scattering electron, thereby ionizing the atom and increasing the wavelength of the X-ray. The scattered photon can go in any direction, but a direction similar to the original direction is more likely, especially for high-energy X-rays. The probability for different scattering angles are described by the Klein–Nishina formula. The transferred energy can be directly obtained from the <b>scattering</b> <b>angle</b> from the conservation of energy and momentum.|$|E
500|$|In many {{circumstances}} scattering causes radiation to redden because entropy {{results in}} the predominance of many low-energy photons over few high-energy ones (while conserving total energy). Except possibly under carefully controlled conditions, scattering does not produce the same relative change in wavelength across the whole spectrum; that is, any calculated [...] is generally a function of wavelength. Furthermore, scattering from random media generally occurs at many angles, and [...] {{is a function of}} the <b>scattering</b> <b>angle.</b> If multiple scattering occurs, or the scattering particles have relative motion, then there is generally distortion of spectral lines as well.|$|E

Within the experimental uncertainty, no influence of the electron spin was discovered for <b>scattering</b> <b>angles</b> ≤ 30 °. At 15 eV excitation energy and <b>scattering</b> <b>angles</b> ≥ 80 °, increasing spin effects become apparent. The experimental data are compared to theoretical predictions from a first-order full-relativistic distorted-wave model, a five-state Breit-Pauli R-matrix (close-coupling) approach, and a convergent close-coupling model, in which relativistic effects are accounted for by adding non-relativistic amplitudes using known intermediate-coupling coefficients. At <b>scattering</b> <b>angles</b> ≤ 15 °, all of the theories reproduce the experimental data well, whereas the CCC model exhibits the best overall agreement with experiment at large <b>scattering</b> <b>angles...</b>|$|R

[...] However, as the crystal rotates away from the diffraction angle, the elastic (main) peak drops in intensity.

2500|$|Bragg {{diffraction}} {{occurs when}} radiation, with wavelength comparable to atomic spacings, is scattered in a specular fashion by the atoms of a crystalline system, and undergoes constructive interference. For a crystalline solid, the waves are scattered from lattice planes separated by the interplanar distance d.
