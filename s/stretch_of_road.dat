This was the last game of the season for Baylor; even with a win they would not be bowl-eligible.|$|E
5|$|The name of {{the road}} matches its winding route, but {{actually}} derives from the emblem of the Snake Inn, {{one of the few}} buildings on the high <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>road.</b> In turn, the pub's name and sign were derived from the serpent on the Cavendish arms of William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire. In the early 21st century, the inn was renamed the Snake Pass Inn, such that the inn now refers to the road that referred to itself.|$|E

5|$|During the screenwriting process, Parker and Colesberry began {{scouting}} locations. They visited {{eight states}} based on suggestions {{made by the}} location department. The shooting script required that a total of 62 locations be used for filming. In December 1987, Parker and Colesberry traveled to Mississippi to visit the <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>road</b> where Goodman, Chaney and Schwerner were murdered. The filmmakers were initially reluctant about filming in Mississippi; they expressed interest in filming in Forsyth County, Georgia before being persuaded by John Horne, head of the Mississippi's film commission. Parker also met with Mississippi governor Ray Mabus, who voiced his support of the film's production.|$|E

Once SR 3 reaches the town of Hayfork, it travels along Hyampom Road east and snakes through the mountains to Douglas City and the junction with SR 299. From there, SR 3 runs concurrently with SR 299 north to the town of Weaverville. SR 3 then separates from SR 299, providing access to the Whiskeytown-Shasta-Trinity National Recreation Area and Trinity Dam along Lewiston Lake.|$|E
5|$|The current A20, {{which runs}} through the village, was once a turnpike, {{probably}} established between 1780 and 1820 to connect London with Dover. The Turnpike Act of 1744 required that Turnpike trusts set up milestones along these roads. A series of mileposts made in cast-iron appear on the <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>road</b> between Aylesford and Addington; at Ditton, Larkfield and Ryarsh. The one at Larkfield is shown on an 1862 Ordnance Survey map and the Ditton post is shown on a similar map of 1869. Both the Larkfield and Ditton posts are classed as Class II listed buildings.|$|E

5|$|In 1754, a <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>road</b> {{south of}} Altrincham, along the Manchester to Chester route, was turnpiked. Turnpikes were toll roads which taxed {{passengers}} {{for the maintenance}} of the road. Further sections were turnpiked in 1765 from Timperley to Sale, and 1821 from Altrincham to Stockport. The maintenance of roads passed to local authorities in 1888, although by then most turnpike trusts had already declined. The connection of the Bridgewater Canal to Altrincham in 1765 stimulated the development of market gardening, and for many years Altrincham was noted for its vegetables. By 1767, warehouses had been built alongside the canal at Broadheath, {{the first step in the}} development of Broadheath as an industrial area and the beginning of Altrincham's industrialisation. The canal was connected in 1776 to the River Mersey, providing the town not only with a water route to Manchester, but also to the Irish Sea.|$|E
5|$|Upon making landfall, Hudah {{impacted}} {{the same}} regions that were affected {{earlier in the}} year by Cyclone Leon–Eline and Severe Tropical Storm Gloria. The cyclone produced waves at least 8m (26ft) in height, which impacted the coast. Across affected areas, coffee plantations, fruit trees, and rice crops in low-lying areas were damaged. Food warehouses in the northeastern areas of Madagascar were destroyed. In the small town of Antalaha, up to 90percent of all homes were destroyed, and two people were killed. The city's water and electrical systems were cut off. Only eight homes remained intact along a <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>road</b> leading from the town to the local airstrip. As a result, only concrete structures remained standing, while those made of iron sheeting or wood materials were destroyed. Thus, the road was covered in debris, slightly delaying airlift operations to the region in the storm's aftermath. Nearby vanilla fields were also severely damaged.|$|E
5|$|While General Ngô Quang Trưởng {{was still}} busy reorganising South Vietnamese units in I Corps, on March 20 the Tri Thien Command {{finalised}} their plan to capture Huế, {{with the objective}} of preventing South Vietnamese forces from regrouping there. At 2:30pm on the same day, President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu phoned the ARVN 1st Brigade Headquarters, and ordered General Trưởng to defend only Da Nang {{due to the lack of}} resources. Beginning at 5:40am on March 21, the VPA 325th and 324th Divisions attacked South Vietnamese units positioned astride Highway 1. At the same time, elements of the K5 Special Forces Battalion destroyed Thua Luu Bridge, which connected a <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>road</b> on Highway 1 between Huế and Da Nang, forcing thousands of South Vietnamese civilian and military vehicles heading towards Da Nang to turn back. The ARVN 20th Tank Squadron was then sent out to reopen Highway 1, but was defeated by the VPA 203rd Armoured Regiment.|$|E

5|$|Along the Odishan coast, the cyclone {{generated}} a 5–6m (16–20ft) storm surge that brought {{water up to}} 35km (20mi) inland, inundating a large swath of coastal areas. The Indian Ministry of Urban Development estimated a peak storm surge height of 6.7m (22ft). One visually estimated storm surge of 9m (30ft) was reported; however, this estimate was determined to have been too high. Regardless, no in-situ measurement of the peak storm surge exists as all potential instruments were destroyed by the storm. Storm surge was responsible {{for a majority of}} the fatalities linked to the 1999Odisha cyclone, accounting for around 7,000deaths. The intense wave action sank 9,085fishing boats and caused the loss of 22,143fishing nets. Some fishing trawlers were carried and deposited 1.5–2.0km (0.9–1.2mi) inland. A 4km (2.5mi) <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>road</b> leading out of Paradip was covered by sand dunes measuring 1m (3.3ft) in height and 0.5km (0.3mi) in width. Paradip Port sustained severe damage to several components including various warehouses and its power transmission system, though its core infrastructure remained intact. Damage at the port was estimated at around ₹300million (US$6.9million). The storm surge destroyed nearly every house in Paradip near the point of landfall. In Gopalpur, 27villages were submerged by the surge. To the south in southern Andhra Pradesh, 48trawlers sank.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, Hector Duff {{wrote of}} how spotted hyenas in the Mzimba {{district}} of Angoniland would wait at dawn outside people's huts and attack {{them when they}} opened their doors. In 1908–09 in Uganda, spotted hyenas regularly killed sufferers of African sleeping sickness as they slept outside in camps. Spotted hyenas are widely feared in Malawi, {{where they have been}} known to occasionally attack people at night, particularly during the hot season when people sleep outside. Hyena attacks were widely reported in Malawi's Phalombe plain, to the north of Michesi Mountain. Five deaths were recorded in 1956, five in 1957 and six in 1958. This pattern continued until 1961 when eight people were killed. During the 1960s, Flying Doctors received over two dozen cases of hyena attacks on humans in Kenya. An anecdotal 2004 news report from the World Wide Fund for Nature indicates that 35 people were killed by spotted hyenas during a 12-month period in Mozambique along a 20km <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>road</b> near the Tanzanian border.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} shot at Pinewood Studios at its 007 Stage in the UK, as well as Weissensee in Austria. The pre-title {{sequence}} was filmed on the Rock of Gibraltar and although the sequence shows a hijacked Land Rover careering down various sections of road for several minutes before bursting through a wall towards the sea, the location mostly used the same short <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>road</b> {{at the very top}} of the Rock, shot from numerous different angles. The beach defences seen at the foot of the Rock in the initial shot were also added solely for the film, to an otherwise non-military area. The action involving the Land Rover switched from Gibraltar to Beachy Head in the UK for the shot showing the vehicle actually getting airborne. Trial runs of the stunt with the Land Rover, during which Bond escapes by parachute from the tumbling vehicle, were filmed in the Mojave Desert, although the final cut of the film uses a shot achieved using a dummy. Other locations included Germany, the United States, and Italy, while the desert scenes were shot in Ouarzazate, Morocco. The conclusion of the film {{was shot at}} the Schönbrunn Palace, Vienna and Elveden Hall, Suffolk.|$|E
