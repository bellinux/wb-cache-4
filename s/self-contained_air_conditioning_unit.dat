40|$|DE 10235736 A UPAB: 20040331 NOVELTY - As an <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>unit</b> is shut off, a heat {{exchanger}} or other components affected by condensation is/are heated up to a raised temperature. Increasing the temperature kills possible bacteria and mold fungi. At the raised temperature, {{water on the}} surface of the {{heat exchanger}} evaporates so that, e. g., motor vehicle windows are prevented from steaming up as the vehicle starts up. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a motor vehicle <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>unit.</b> USE - For eliminating smells in motor vehicle <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>units.</b> ADVANTAGE - Users are not inconvenienced by a hot air current, because the heat exchanger heats up as the <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>unit</b> shuts off...|$|R

Provided the ceiling fan is properly sized for the room {{in which it is}} operating, its efficiency of moving air far exceeds that of an <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>unit,</b> therefore, for peak efficiency, the air conditioner should be set to a low fan setting and the ceiling fan should be used to circulate the air.|$|R

40|$|Within a {{research}} project at the Fraunhofer Institute for Machine Tools and Forming Technology IWU, vibration description methods are applied using the example of an <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>unit</b> (AC unit) from a railway vehicle. The AC unit consists of several components, where usually the compressors and fans contribute most to the radiated sound power resp. to the transmitted structure-borne sound into the vehicle. In a first step, forces F and accelerations a under steady-state conditions were measured {{on each of the}} six mounting brackets of the <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>unit.</b> Afterwards, all of the dominant vibration sources of the unit were investigated individually concerning their contribution at each of their contact points. Finally, knowing the mobilities Y of the contact points between sources and unit enables detailed analysis of the system itself. Moreover, it also indicates "weak points" which have to be avoided according to an improved vibrational behavior of the complete <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>unit...</b>|$|R

40|$|The <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> (AC) <b>unit</b> {{is one of}} the {{dominant}} sound sources for exterior and interior noise of a railway vehicle. The design of such devices is a compromise between major functions like efficiency, fluid mechanics, thermodynamics and acoustics. The vibrational and acoustical behavior of an <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>unit</b> needs to be quantified in every state of the development process, starting in an early design phase. Therefore preferably simple and fast calculation tools are needed, which can be easily built up and adapted {{in a short period of}} time. Within a research project at the Fraunhofer Institute for Machine Tools and Forming Technology (IWU) an acoustical calculation model, based on transfer matrices of the different components, has been created to give a sufficiently accurate description of the sound power radiated by the <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>unit.</b> In a first step the sound power of relevant sources has been characterized by measurement data. Furthermore the acoustical transfer behavior of ducts, chambers and additional components like condensers or evaporators have been individually investigated and implemented in the model using -port elements. Finally, the sources and transfer components were combined to get a complete representation of the acoustical properties of the <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>unit,</b> which can be used for parameter variation studies...|$|R
