In 1919, she placed both her daughters in a <b>state</b> <b>orphanage,</b> mistakenly believing that they would be better fed there. Alya became ill, and Tsvetaeva removed her, but Irina died there of starvation in 1920. The child's death caused Tsvetaeva great grief and regret. In one letter, she wrote, [...] "God punished me."

2500|$|The Nazis {{kept an eye}} out for Polish {{children}} who possessed Nordic racial characteristics. An estimated total of 50,000 children, majority taken from orphanages and foster homes in the annexed lands, but some separated from their parents, were taken into a special Germanization program. Polish women deported to Germany as forced laborers and who bore children were a common victim of this policy, with their infants regularly taken. If the child passed the battery of racial, physical and psychological tests, they were sent on to Germany for [...] "Germanization". At least 4,454 children were given new German names, forbidden to use Polish language, and reeducated Nazi institutions. Few were ever reunited with their original families. Those deemed as unsuitable for Germanization for being [...] "not Aryan enough" [...] were sent to orphanages or even to concentration camps like Auschwitz, where many perished, often killed by intercardiac injections of phenol. For Polish forced laborers, in some cases if an examination of the parents suggested that the child might not be [...] "racially valuable", the mother was compelled to have an abortion. Infants who did not pass muster would be removed to a <b>state</b> <b>orphanage</b> (Ausländerkinder-Pflegestätte), where many died from the lack of food.|$|E
