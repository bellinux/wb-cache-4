50|$|The {{detachable}} barrel {{is locked}} in place with a dowel at the receiver and a nut at the magazine tube. The barrel and chamber are chrome-coated for increased durability and corrosion protection. The chamber is sealed by rotating the <b>sealing</b> <b>wedge,</b> which locks into the port in the shank of the barrel. Its trigger mechanism is located on a detachable mounting plate. Cartridges are fed from a tubular magazine under the barrel, and shells are ejected {{from the side of}} the receiver. The forearm is located on the magazine, and is connected to the slide frame by two action bars. A blocking lever blocks the forearm when the hammer is cocked. A cross-bolt trigger safety prevents an accidental pull of the trigger from firing the gun.|$|E

Pressures {{to be sealed}} are high and pulsating in nature. Assembly and in situ service requirements necessitate a radial expanding seal design; which is preloaded to generate enough radial pressure {{so that there is}} no leakage {{and at the same time}} control its expansion so as not deform into plastic range and thus hinder seal extraction in service. The objective of this paper is to put forward, a mathematical relationship between clamp load and radial / axial bearing pressure which allows design engineer to assess effect of radial play, friction, <b>seal</b> <b>wedge</b> angle and the preload requirement. A design engineer will be able to decide on dimensions and the taper angle along with the bolt system dimensions at a very early stage of design and be sure of his design concept. Seal size determines the pump throughput and the system maximum pressure and thus the pump rating. Hence importance of this simple and effective evaluation methodology...|$|R

These fames were, however, only floor-to-floor height, screwed to the building on four sides; one string course that reached across the three floors consisted, in fact, of three different sections.

40|$|Roxtec is {{well-known}} {{as a company}} which designs and supplies cable and pipe sealing systems. The purpose of this thesis was to develop new solutions to verify the installed systems. We use some chemistry knowledge and modern technology, such as pressure sensors, etc. {{to meet the needs}} mentioned above. We have added some new function into the original stay plate, too. And it enables the stay plate to tell the tightness of the sealing system by measuring the lateral displacement of the modules. We also assumed that we can compress the system by a torque wrench with certain Nm instead of checking the <b>sealed</b> system by <b>wedge</b> clip. 072772415...|$|R
50|$|The {{water slope}} uses a {{moveable}} gate in a sloping channel. To ascend the slope the moving gate can be opened {{to allow a}} boat to enter the concrete channel. The gate then closes off {{the bottom of the}} channel and <b>seals</b> off a <b>wedge</b> of water on which the boat is floating, within the channel. The moveable gate is drawn up the sloping concrete channel pushing the wedge of water before it until reaching the upper water level. When the water level in the wedge is equalised with that of the upper canal, an upper (non-moving) gate is opened and the boat is then allowed to float free.|$|R
50|$|Softgels are {{produced}} {{in a process}} known as encapsulation using the Rotary Die Encapsulation process invented by Robert Pauli Scherer. The encapsulation process {{has been described as a}} form/fill/seal process. Two flat ribbons of shell material are manufactured on the machine and brought together on a twin set of rotating dies. The dies contain recesses in the desired size and shape, which cut out the ribbons into a two-dimensional shape, and form a seal around the outside. At the same time a pump delivers a precise dose of fill material through a nozzle incorporated into a filling wedge whose tip sits between the two ribbons in between two die pockets at the point of cut out. The wedge is heated to facilitate the <b>sealing</b> process. The <b>wedge</b> injection causes the two flat ribbons to expand into the die pockets, giving rise to the three-dimensional finished product. After encapsulation, the softgels are dried for two days to two weeks depending on the product.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{emergency}} lighting is installed {{in virtually every}} commercial and high occupancy residential building. The lights consist {{of one or more}} incandescent bulbs or one or more clusters of high-intensity light-emitting diodes (LED). The {{emergency lighting}} heads are usually either PAR 36 <b>sealed</b> beams or <b>wedge</b> base lamps. All units have some sort of a device to focus and intensify the light they produce. This can either be {{in the form of a}} plastic cover over the fixture, or a reflector placed behind the light source. Most individual light sources can be rotated and aimed for where light is needed most in an emergency, such as toward fire exits. Modern fixtures usually have a test button of some sort which temporarily overrides the unit and causes it to switch on the lights and operate from battery power even if the main power is still on. Modern systems are operated with relatively low voltage, usually from 6-12 volts. This both reduces the size of the batteries required and reduces the load on the circuit to which the emergency light is wired. Modern fixtures include a small transformer in the base of the fixture which steps-down the voltage from main current to the low voltage required by the lights. Batteries are commonly made of lead-calcium, and can last for 10 years or more on continuous charge. U.S. fire safety codes require a minimum of 90 minutes on battery power during a power outage along the path of egress.|$|R

Kirilyuk Odessa National Medical University, Odessa Abstract Introduction of suture less electro sealing technologies, made its wide use in non-invasive thoracic surgery. Most important use of these methods was seen in performing video thoracoscopic lung resections (VTLR). The aim of the work - to access possibilities of different methods of electro <b>sealing</b> VTLR. Videothoracoscopic <b>wedge</b> resection was performed in 142 patients with different surgical pathologies of chest. Out of which 103 operations were closed methods and 39 were video-assisted. Suture less VTLR were performed with the use of electro sealing complexes: EK- 300 M 1, “LigaSure Valleylab” and electrosurgical instruments. Few patients with suture less methods were additionally sealed with mechanical sutures by using end staplers and traditional stitching apparatus. All the examined patient were discharged from the hospital. Average hospital stay was 7. 8 days. Complications were seen in 7. 7 % cases. Lethality was not registered. High efficiency of VTLR for the diagnosis and treatment of solitary and disseminated lung processes of unknown etiologist and pneumothorax. No evidence in the results and effectiveness of EK 300 M 1 and LigaSure Valleylab in closed and video assisted methods. Criteria for the possibilities of combinations of suture less and mechanical suture in VTLR. Use of VTLR aloe us to minimize the cost of the operation. In the hospital, these methods can be used in closed and video assisted methods in VTLR, but needs further endoscopic electrosealing instruments.
