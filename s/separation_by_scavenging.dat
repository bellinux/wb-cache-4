The heterogeneous photocatalysts employing semiconductor catalysts (TiO 2, ZnO, Fe 2 O 3,) have shown their efficiency in degrading a wide range of pollutants in water. Metal oxides are more suitable, since they are more resistant to poisoning and deactivation.|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} Tursiops truncatus mandibles in the {{collection}} of fossil marine mammals in the Rotterdam Natural History Museum have marks consisting of several parallel linear grooves. These marks are also found on four atlas complexes, a scapula and on one vertebra. The hypothesis that they are bite marks and were caused <b>by</b> <b>scavenging</b> rays (Rajidae, Chondrichthyes) was tested with a real-life experiment using different shark and ray species, allowing them to scavenge on cow ribs as proxies for the dolphin bones. The bite marks of these animals were compared with the fossil marks and show that the fossil marks are most likely caused <b>by</b> <b>scavenging</b> rays...|$|R

5|$|Common ravens are {{omnivorous}} {{and highly}} opportunistic: their diet may vary widely with location, season and serendipity.

50|$|The {{brown hyena}} inhabits desert areas, semi-desert, and open {{woodland}} savannahs. It can survive close to urban areas <b>by</b> <b>scavenging.</b> The brown hyena favors rocky, mountainous areas, as they provide shade {{and it is}} not dependent on the ready availability of water sources for frequent drinking. Home ranges are 233 to 466 km2 in size.|$|R
50|$|The {{yellow-headed caracara}} (Milvago chimachima) is a {{bird of prey}} in the family Falconidae.

It had to be scrapped in 2011, however, after being vandalised <b>by</b> <b>scavenging</b> scrap metal thieves at the SANRASM storage site in Chamdor.|$|R
50|$|Pralidoxime {{chloride}}, {{also known}} as 2-PAM chloride, is also used as an antidote. Rather than counteracting the initial effects of the nerve agent on the nervous system like atropine, pralidoxime chloride reactivates the poisoned enzyme (acetylcholinesterase) <b>by</b> <b>scavenging</b> the phosphoryl group attached on the functional hydroxyl group of the enzyme. Though safer to use, it takes longer to act.|$|R
