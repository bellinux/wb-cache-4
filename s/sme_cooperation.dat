40|$|The {{literature}} on ‘open’ innovation {{emphasizes the need}} to engage in external knowledge relations in order to innovate. Particularly for <b>SMEs,</b> research <b>cooperation</b> and R&D outsourcing can offer possibilities to complement the often limited internal research resources. However, they also bring in their wake requirements in terms of absorptive capacity and managerial skills of the internal R&D personnel. The paper focuses on the different requirements in terms of availability and training of research managers and R&D experts for research cooperation versus R&D outsourcing in SMEs. An empirical analysis of micro-level data provided by the OECD business R&D survey for Belgium reveals that the relation between R&D personnel requirements and research collaboration and R&D outsourcing depends upon the SME’s size. Therefore, to study this subject appropriately a distinction between very small, small, and medium-sized firms is relevant. Very small firms engage significantly less in research cooperation than medium-sized firms and the propensity to engage in research cooperation is positively associated with the share of PhD holders among the research managers and R&D experts. For R&D outsourcing a lower involvement is noted in medium-sized firms, and the propensity to outsource increases with the formal qualification level of the R&D personnel and with R&D training. Among the SMEs, small firms are most engaged in research cooperation and in R&D outsourcing. In the case of research cooperation they rely on highly qualified experts. For R&D outsourcing activities both the presence of research managers and R&D experts is important. status: publishe...|$|R

We sent a questionnaire to 3, 000 {{small and medium-sized}} enterprises (SMEs), whose main business sector is manufacture and which locate in Aichi Prefecture, one of the largest economic regions in Japan. 803 SMEs answered this questionnaire. We asked 53 questions, including firm’s current business condition, relationship with their main banks, financial support from local governments, cooperation with universities and research institutes, and usage of public guarantee scheme. The main feature of this survey is that it focuses on the role of local government in providing financial supports to SMEs. According to the results, approximately 30 % of the respondents currently use financial support programs provided by local governments, such as favorable fixed interest rates loan guaranteed by public guarantee corporations. Over 90 % of the respondents understand outlines of these financial support programs. We find that the support programs are very popular among SMEs. Many respondents that have used the program said that the programs contribute to the improvement of corporate performance and enable them to invest new equipment.

Particularly for <b>SMEs,</b> research <b>cooperation</b> and R&D outsourcing can offer possibilities to complement the often limited internal research resources. However, external knowledge relations potentially bring in their wake a loss of technology assets. This paper focuses on research cooperation and R&D outsourcing in SMEs. Two functions of research cooperation are envisaged: generating new knowledge and exchanging existing knowledge previously developed within the firm. The paper addresses two items that are underdeveloped in the current literature. First, {{attention is paid to}} the heterogeneity in terms of firm size of SMEs. A distinction is made between micro, small-sized, and medium-sized firms. Second, consideration is given to the formal management of R&D activities. This is related to the management of the potential risks inherently involved in external knowledge relations. It is measured by the presence of a formal R&D manager within the SME. A descriptive quantitative empirical analysis is presented based on firm-level data provided by the OECD business R&D survey for Belgium covering the period 2004 - 2005. The starting point is a representative sample of 140 (quasi-) permanent R&D active SMEs. The analysis reveals marked differences in R&D outsourcing behaviour according {{to the size of the}} SME. In this respect, medium-sized firms are found to be significantly less involved in R&D outsourcing (one out of four firms) compared to micro and small-sized firms (one out of two firms is engaged in R&D outsourcing). On average, two-thirds of the (quasi-) permanent R&D active firms have a formal R&D manager and there are no marked differences according to firm size. The presence of an R&D manager turns out to be significantly associated with the firm’s engagement in R&D outsourcing and with knowledge exchange in research cooperation. There is no interaction effect between the presence of an R&D manager and firm size to explain firm engagement in research cooperation and R&D outsourcing. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Small and {{medium-sized}} tourism enterprises (SME) constitute {{the great majority}} of tourism businesses. They are a fundamental component of the tourism product, they affect the image of destinations, and they also act as brokers between tourists and local societies. Scarcity of resources has been identified as one of the features typical of SMEs. National Tourism Organisations (NTO) usually carry the responsibility for marketing countries as tourism destinations and often also have development functions. Although the public sector budgets of NTOs are declining, they may maintain the level of tourism investment by having good cooperation with the private sector. This research was an attempt to explore interorganisational relations between tourism SMEs and NTOs. These relations were surveyed by identifying exchange of resources between organisations. More specifically, the focus of this research was on resource dependence which results from the exchange of resources between <b>SMEs</b> and NTOs. <b>Cooperation</b> was suggested to reduce the resource dependence and, therefore, its influence was also explored. In order to measure the level of resource dependence a survey was carried out in Finland of tourism SMEs using a postal and online instrument. This presented the dependence-defining factors. The level of dependence of the Finnish SMEs on the Finnish Tourist Board, the national tourism organisation of Finland, was reported to be at a moderate level, thereby suggesting that the SMEs retain substantial resource autonomy. Differences in the level of resource dependence were established between different types of enterprises. Size of enterprises, number of their foreign guests, their marketing activities, and their cooperation with others affected the level of resource dependence. The SMEs were most dependent on such FTB resources as destination marketing and marketing knowledge. A factor analysis revealed two factors underlying the resource dependence of SMEs on NTOs.

40|$|This {{working paper}} aims to build {{knowledge}} about how Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander tourism enterprises operating in remote regions of Australia can build their competitiveness {{in the global}} marketplace and ensure their long-term viability and resilience, despite the multiple challenges that operating in remote Australian regions brings. The paper draws on Australian and international research and management practice concerned with building the competitiveness of small and remote enterprises within the global economy. The review shows that improvements in cooperation strategies may enable small- and medium-sized (SME) Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander tourism enterprises to better address the wide range of challenges they contend with while operating in remote Australia. These challenges include, but are not confined to, remoteness and isolation from key resources and support, a lack of critical mass of enterprises to achieve economies of scale, limited capacity to innovate and grow, and constraints within social and cultural realms. In general, these challenges are not unique to Australian operators but are experienced by many Indigenous and other SMEs across the world. Many of these enterprises have been able to reduce their challenges and improve their business success by actively embracing strategies of cooperation. Cooperation in industry value chains is an inherent part of the way many tourism enterprises coordinate and package tourism experiences for visitors and maximise the value experienced by enterprises and customers. However, unrealised opportunities for mutually beneficial cooperation often exist, especially in <b>SMEs.</b> Enterprise <b>cooperation</b> can provide many benefits, including improvements in value chain efficiencies, competiveness and profitability; access to resources, innovation and product development; knowledge and skills transfer; marketing and promotion; investment; and business opportunities.
