40|$|Complex <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> {{of special}} {{interest}} brings various rules and duties that must be followed. The role these objects play {{on a global scale}} is irreplaceable. It concerns complexes of buildings or their parts that secure elementary activities. These activities ensure people's basic needs such as energy and food supplies or services provided by the state administration and other society's needs. On the other hand, {{it is a fact that}} these buildings face various undesirable phenomenons disturbing their functions on the daily basis. Terrorism is a global problem we most frequently rank among these negative phenomenons. Terrorists use various sabotage and bomb attacks that cause high number of casualties and uncountable material damages. Natural threats like hurricanes, floods any many others belong among other phenomenons. Legislative regulations serving for elimination and moderation of the consequences of these undesirable phenomenons belong to the most essential security measures. The fire safety law, regulating one of the domains of complex security, represents one of the basic laws. Other norms are incorporated within the domain of fire protection such as local ordinances or regulations. Construction and technical requirements incorporated in the construction law represent one of the next fields of complex security. Last but not least different practices securing rescue and liquidation works represent very important safety measures. They form the elementary methodics for successful evacuation and many different activities. We can name endless amount of security elements sourcing from technical and mechanical, physically present safety engines. There are for example diverse antifire gadgets, alarming and monitoring systems. We can continue by mentioning protective elements such as regime and control measures for access into the important objects and moving inside, inhibitions and many other security elements and principles. In the research part of the thesis several objectives and hypothesis were established. The aim was to make an effort to find the answer to a hypothetical question asking whether the contemporary valid principles of complex security of important objects are sufficient. The next step is to attempt, based on the ascertained facts, to outline prospective changes and improvements in the domain of buildings' complex security. The qualitative research method in the form of interviews with specialists was employed in order to fulfil these tasks. There were 10 participating respondents from the domain related to the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings.</b> The ascertained results imply several important facts. For instance, one of the major contributions was that the chosen interviewees mentioned an immense number of interesting and inspiring findings in the domain of complex <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings.</b> There were several important findings. In present, security elements and principles are properly technically dealt with but there are many factors going against support of this assertion. One of them are, for example, high financial acquisition and service costs of these safety measures. Another one is quite minor activity exercised by the top management in the field of <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings.</b> All these findings lead to a conclusion that complex <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> {{of special interest}} is insufficient. In my opinion, a possible solution would be to start talking about imminent threats such as the upper-mentioned terrorism etc. It is necessary to realize the fact that ensuring today's security is very costly but important. Desirable outcomes cannot be reached without directing financial resources at arranging complex <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings.</b> By underrating security the society runs increasing risks bringing serious consequences with them as a result...|$|E

40|$|Firstly, {{the paper}} aims to present basic {{analytical}} concepts in researching social aspects of urban neighborhoods: community, social cohesion, social capital, {{as well as}} relationship between physical and social structures within the neighborhood. Secondly, the paper presents empirical research that explores {{if there is a}} process of differentiation in the perception of neighborhood among professionals living in the neighborhoods exposed to significant changes in social and urban structures. By employing a qualitative methodology, based on interviews with 40 professionals in two types of neighborhoods (one exposed to social filtration and the other to the process of gentrification), the study reveals that neighborhood as a community prevails in all localities, that the neighborhood as a commodity develops more distinctively in better quality neighborhoods while the perception of neighborhood as a negative context (social and physical) emerges in lower quality neighborhoods. The importance of network support and reciprocity appeared equally developed in both residential areas enhancing the sense of belonging to the neighborhood. The greatest difference was documented in respondents' safety perception primarily due to differences in neighborhoods' social context (crime, drug abuse and people from the margins in the lower quality area). Spatial characteristics influenced the perceived level of safety too (better equipment and <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> in the higher quality area). Social capital understood as potential resource that can be mobilized through intermediate institutions is generally low, without differences between the observed areas. It is visible in the tendency among all respondents to employ primarily the private sector in solving neighborhood problems instead of demanding institutional support, as well as in preferring the payment of services to participation in neighborhood activities...|$|E

These variants, also the given insurance companies, are compared by using of monocriteria and multicriteria evaluation of variants. It is possible to apprise basic concept in the first part, relating to insurance industry, insurance, enterprise, small and medium sized enterprises, mono and multicriteria evaluation of variants. There is a given company defined in the practical part, what are these variants evaluate for. There are also requests defined, that a company holder determines with a help of insurance broker, and then insurance offers are in this part defined. I used a method of monocriteria evaluation that supposes pessimistic approach for evaluation of variants. The aim of this evaluation was to determine which combination of insurances {{would be for the}} businessman and his company the optimal variant. Variants were evaluated with the help of multicriteria evaluation later, specifically Saaty´ method of weight determination and AHP method for order determination. Criteria, which were evaluated, are for example insurance premium over the discount that was offered through individual insurance companies, requirements for the <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> that provide insurance companies, etc. Four variants were evaluated. Today´s businessmen often solve problem, how they should protect themselves and their business against risks that can threaten. At this moment it is important to realize not only what type of risks threaten the business, but also the extent of its. When a businessman decides to one insurance option, it´s necessary to navigate himself through the offers of insurance companies and even get advice from an insurance broker. He can also for example decide based on personal experience with the insurance company. It´s definitely important to analyse the offers from different insurers...|$|E

Simulation systems enable what-if questions to be posed and the consequences of user actions to be studied in a cost-effective and safe manner. Simulations also enable detailed user behavior to be logged for later study to extract data that may be difficult to capture in real life. This paper describes the development of a multi-user simulation platform that enables certain emergency events to be simulated. All user behavior is logged for later analysis so that user behavior under certain stressful events can be studied. Software agents in the simulation system can be used to model crowds or agents with a particular intent. The system can be used to provide emergency evacuation training.

Time integration is achieved through a conditionally stable explicit scheme. The solving algorithm is completely non-linear, at both geometric level (large displacements; large rotations) and material level (constitutive laws implementing plasticity or damage for example). The program provides a large number of kinematic links between entities, for instance for boundary conditions, contact between structures or fluid-structure interaction. JRC.
