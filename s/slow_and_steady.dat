5|$|By 1948, as {{the purely}} {{occupational}} mission was accomplished, {{troops of the}} corps focused more military training and field exercises designed {{to prepare them for}} combat. Its force was eventually downsized to the 24th Infantry Division on Kyūshū and 25th Infantry Division on mid-Honshū. The US Army continued a <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> <b>steady</b> process of post-war drawdown and demobilization on its own, and on 28 March 1950, the corps was formally inactivated in Japan, and its command consolidated with other units.|$|E
5|$|England {{started their}} second innings with {{a deficit of}} 337 runs and reached 1/54 by the {{premature}} {{end of the second}} day due to bad light. The following morning, they made <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> <b>steady</b> progress as Johnston bowled his finger spin from around the wicket with a well-protected off side. The four men in the off side ring had much work to do as Hutton hit the ball there repeatedly. The English batsmen progressed and Johnston had one confident appeal for lbw against Compton, but there were few scares.|$|E
5|$|For the 1937–38 cricket season, Miller {{transferred}} to the VCA Colts, where he won the team's batting trophy for having the best average. At this stage, his method of playing was <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> <b>steady</b> accumulation of runs. Late in the summer, he made his first-class debut for Victoria and hit 181 against Tasmania at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. In 1938–39, he rejoined South Melbourne and also played four further matches for Victoria, scoring 125 runs {{at an average of}} 25.00. However, he was yet to play in the Sheffield Shield competition, having appeared only in one-off matches.|$|E

50|$|Modified-release dosage and its {{variants}} are mechanisms used in tablets (pills) and capsules {{to dissolve}} a drug {{over time in}} order to be released <b>slower</b> <b>and</b> <b>steadier</b> into the bloodstream while having the advantage of being taken at less frequent intervals than immediate-release (IR) formulations of the same drug. For example, extended-release morphine enables people with chronic pain to only take one or two tablets per day.|$|R
50|$|Bowyangs {{are also}} the straps that pilots, and other flight-crew, wear just below the knee that connects to their ejection-seat {{mechanism}} {{in such a way}} that the seat's ejection stroke hauls both legs back against the seat (to clear the instrument panel above) and restrains them from flailing about in the slipstream before the seat is <b>slowed</b> <b>and</b> <b>steadied.</b> The attachment is released as the pilot is released from the seat during its automatic sequencing. This colloquial use of bowyangs was started in the Royal New Zealand Air Force and spread, via the seat-manufacturer, to other air forces.|$|R
5|$|General Matsui, {{along with}} the Army General Staff, envisaged making a <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> <b>steady</b> march on Nanking, but his {{subordinates}} refused to play along and instead raced eagerly {{with each other to}} be the first to get to the city. Soon all units were roaring to Nanking at the breakneck pace of up to forty kilometers (25 miles) per day. For instance, the 10th Army captured the key town of Guangde on November 30 three days before it was even supposed to start its planned advance, and the SEA captured Danyang on December 2 more than five days ahead of schedule. In order to achieve such speeds, the Japanese soldiers carried little with them except weaponry and ammunition. Because they were marching well ahead of most of their supply lines they had to purchase or loot their food from Chinese civilians along the way.|$|E

It also peaked at twenty on the Top R/Hip-Hop Albums. Within a year, Madonna had sold 2.8million copies in the United States. It placed at number seven on the year-end chart for 1984 and at number25 on the year-end chart for 1985, with Madonna {{becoming}} the top pop artist for the year 1985. After 17 years since its release, the album was certified quintuple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipment of five million copies across United States. With the advent of the Nielsen SoundScan era in 1991, the album sold a further 450,000 copies as of August 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{inhabitants of}} what is now Rwanda were the Twa, a group of aboriginal pygmy hunter-gatherers who settled in the area between 8000 BC and 3000 BC and remain in Rwanda today. Between 700 BC and 1500 AD, a number of Bantu groups migrated into Rwanda, and began to clear forest land for agriculture. The forest-dwelling Twa lost much of their habitat and moved to the slopes of mountains. Historians have several theories regarding the nature of the Bantu migrations; one theory is that the first settlers were Hutu, while the Tutsi migrated later and formed a distinct racial group, possibly of Cushitic origin.

From there, it charted between #20-#50 until January 2003. After a performance at the 53rd Kōhaku Uta Gassen, the song reached #8. It stayed within the top 40 until June. The single charted steadily until next year's Kōhaku Uta Gassen, where Natsukawa, Begin and Ryoko Moriyama performed the song together. The single reached #8 again, and stayed within the top 40 until March. The single still continued to chart slowly, between #50 and #200 before breaking the top 50 once again in 2006, after the release of the Nada Sōsō film.|$|R
5000|$|Nick Crafts, {{along with}} Knick Harley, {{provided}} a very influential reinterpretation of the British industrial {{revolution in the}} 1980s. They measured the growth rates of various industries, and of the different sectors of the economy, {{in order to measure}} the growth of the British economy during the industrial revolution. The found that the overall rate of growth was much lower than had previously been believed, and was heavily concentrated in two industries: cotton and iron. [...] A few historians (though not Crafts himself) used these figures to suggest that it was inappropriate to describe the period as an ‘industrial revolution’. Most, however, argued that although growth rates had been <b>slower</b> <b>and</b> <b>steadier</b> during the industrial revolution than previously imagined, the idea of an ‘industrial revolution’ was still valid.|$|R

5|$|Modern human {{settlement}} {{of what is}} now Rwanda dates from, at the latest, the last glacial period, either in the Neolithic period around 8000 BC, or in the long humid period which followed, up to around 3000 BC. Archaeological excavations have revealed evidence of sparse settlement by hunter gatherers in the late stone age, followed by a larger population of early Iron Age settlers, who produced dimpled pottery and iron tools. These early inhabitants were the ancestors of the Twa, aboriginal pygmy hunter-gatherers who remain in Rwanda today. Between 700 BC and 1500 AD, a number of Bantu groups migrated into Rwanda, clearing forest land for agriculture. The forest-dwelling Twa lost much of their habitat and moved to the mountain slopes. Historians have several theories regarding the nature of the Bantu migrations; one theory is that the first settlers were Hutu, while the Tutsi migrated later to form a distinct racial group, possibly of Nilo-hamitic origin.

5|$|The first geared {{clock was}} invented in the 11th century by the Arab {{engineer}} Ibn Khalaf al-Muradi in Islamic Iberia; it was a water clock that employed a complex gear train mechanism, including both segmental and epicyclic gearing, capable of transmitting high torque. The clock was unrivalled in its use of sophisticated complex gearing, until the mechanical clocks of the mid-14th century. Al-Muradi's clock also employed the use of mercury in its hydraulic linkages, which could function mechanical automata. Al-Muradi's work was known to scholars working under Alfonso X of Castile, hence the mechanism {{may have played a}} role in the development of the European mechanical clocks. Other monumental water clocks constructed by medieval Muslim engineers also employed complex gear trains and arrays of automata. Like the earlier Greeks and Chinese, Arab engineers at the time also developed a liquid-driven escapement mechanism which they employed in some of their water clocks. Heavy floats were used as weights and a constant-head system was used as an escapement mechanism, which was present in the hydraulic controls they used to make heavy floats descend at a <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> <b>steady</b> rate.|$|E

25|$|Singing and {{percussion}} are {{the most}} important aspects of traditional Native American music. Vocalization takes many forms, ranging from solo and choral song to responsorial, unison and multipart singing.

Traditional music usually begins with <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> <b>steady</b> beats that grow gradually faster and more emphatic, while various flourishes like drum and rattle tremolos, shouts and accented patterns add variety and signal changes in performance for singers and dancers.|$|E

Along with revitalization came many changes, including the closing of the Great Western sugar factory in 1955, and a new city charter, adopting a council-manager form of government in 1954. Similarly, Colorado State University's enrollment doubled during the 1960s, making it the city's primary economic force by the end of the century.|$|E

50|$|The {{historical}} {{evidence suggests that}} earlier Irish famines such caused mortality of comparable magnitude to the famine of the 1840s. Some famines, in particular the that of the early 1740s, might have even killed {{a larger proportion of}} the Irish population compared to that of the mid-19th century. Nevertheless, after earlier famines the population recovered relatively quickly if only because most of the survivors did not have the resources to emigrate. By comparison, {{during the first half of}} the nineteenth century the real cost of a transatlantic voyage would fall to a point that by the 1840s even the poorest people could secure passage, albeit under wretched conditions. It seems virtually certain that economic factors alone would have caused considerable emigration from Ireland even without mass starvation. A comparison between the historical populations of Ireland and Scotland proves useful with regards to this point - even though Scotland has not experienced a catastrophic famine in the past two centuries, nevertheless, it has experienced steady emigration over that time, albeit on a <b>slower</b> <b>and</b> <b>steadier</b> pace compared to Ireland. As a result, while the population of Scotland surpassed that of Ireland around the beginning of the 20th century, by the end of the century the population of Ireland once again exceeded that of Scotland.|$|R

While Miller was establishing his base in Big Sur, the Tropic books, then still banned in the USA, were being published in France by the Obelisk Press and later the Olympia Press. There they were acquiring a <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> <b>steady</b> notoriety among both Europeans and the various enclaves of American cultural exiles.

Between 700 BC and 1500 AD, a number of Bantu groups migrated into Rwanda, and began to clear forest land as a way to gain wood for housing and space for their farming/living areas. Historians have several theories regarding the nature of the Bantu migrations: one theory is that the first settlers were Hutu, while the Tutsi migrated later and formed a distinct racial group, possibly of Cushitic origin. An alternative theory is that the migration was <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> <b>steady</b> from neighboring regions, with incoming groups bearing high genetic similarity to the established ones and integrating into rather than conquering the existing society. Under this theory, the Hutu and Tutsi distinction arose later and was not a racial one, but principally a class or caste distinction in which the Tutsi herded cattle while the Hutu farmed the land. The Hutu, Tutsi and Twa of Rwanda share a common language and are collectively known as the Banyarwanda.|$|E
25|$|Air {{brakes on}} the train are {{supplied}} with air from a compressor on each locomotive. When a locomotive is shut off, the compressor no longer supplies the brake system with air. An air brake pipe connects to each car and locomotive {{on the train}}. When air leaks from the various components, the air pressure drops. If {{the system is not}} recharged with air, the locomotive air brakes will become ineffective and provide no braking force. When the air brake control valves sense a drop in pressure in the brake pipe, they are designed to activate the brakes on each car. However, if the rate of leakage is <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> <b>steady,</b> the automatic brakes may not be applied {{as in the case of}} the Lac-Mégantic accident. The train had locomotives that could automatically restart the air-brake system in the event of a brake failure, provided that these locomotives were not shut down as they would be. Also, the TSB found that the “reset safety control” on the lead locomotive was not wired to set the entire train’s brakes in the event of an engine failure.|$|E
40|$|Since 1945, {{a growing}} number of housing experts and {{development}} agencies have come to understand that housing investments {{have a significant impact on}} economic development. The shift in opinion has been <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> fairly <b>steady,</b> occurring with greatest rapidity in the late 1960 s and early 1970 s. It was not prompted by an accumulation of new evidence but by shifts in prevailing economic discourse. New theorisations of human capital made it possible to recognise the full social and economic consequences of housing. New theories of flexible production, including the use of subcontracting, led to a revaluation of the house building industry, a key vehicle of housing policy. The higher policy profile of housing still rests on a weak empirical foundation and is vulnerable to shifts in intellectual fashion...|$|R

40|$|Is there {{a crisis}} in Australian science and {{mathematics}} education? Declining enrolments in upper secondary Science and Mathematics courses have gained much attention from the media, politicians and high-profile scientists {{over the last few}} years, yet there is no consensus amongst stakeholders about either the nature or the magnitude of the changes. We have collected raw enrolment data from the education departments of each of the Australian states and territories from 1992 to 2012 and analysed the trends for Biology, Chemistry, Physics, two composite subject groups (Earth Sciences and Multidisciplinary Sciences), as well as entry, intermediate and advanced Mathematics. The results of these analyses are discussed in terms of participation rates, raw enrolments and gender balance. We have found that the total number of students in Year 12 increased by around 16 % from 1992 to 2012 while the participation rates for most Science and Mathematics subjects, as a proportion of the total Year 12 cohort, fell (Biology (- 10 %), Chemistry (- 5 %), Physics (- 7 %), Multidisciplinary Science (- 5 %), intermediate Mathematics (- 11 %), advanced Mathematics (- 7 %) in the same period. There were increased participation rates in Earth Sciences (+ 0. 3 %) and entry Mathematics (+ 11 %). In each case the greatest rates of change occurred prior to 2001 <b>and</b> have been <b>slower</b> <b>and</b> <b>steadier</b> since. We propose that the broadening of curriculum offerings, further driven by students' self-perception of ability and perceptions of subject difficulty and usefulness, are the most likely cause of the changes in participation. While these continuing declines may not amount to a crisis, there is undoubtedly serious cause for concern...|$|R
