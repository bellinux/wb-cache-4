5|$|Most of Tender Mercies {{was filmed}} in Waxahachie and Palmer, two towns in Ellis County in north central Texas. Beresford largely avoided the Victorian {{architecture}} and other picturesque elements of Waxahachie and instead focused on relatively barren locations more characteristic of West Texas. The town {{portrayed in the}} film is never identified by name. Foote <b>said</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> wrote the script {{he did not have}} the same isolated and lonely vision for the setting Beresford did, but he felt the atmosphere the director captured served the story well.|$|E

25|$|On 21 February 2001, {{police arrested}} Field at his flat in Birmingham. Field {{was held in}} police custody for more than the {{lawfully}} prescribed 24 hours in order to assist the investigation. He denied knowing Tutill or having {{anything to do with}} his death, and whilst admitting to his historic offences against boys said he had put that behaviour behind him. Just before Field was put into his cell for a third night he had been asked to submit DNA samples. Field could not sleep that night and the following day he confessed in detail to the abduction, rape and murder of Tutill. He said he had seen a boy get off a bus and thumb for a lift and that he had picked him up. He said he drove the boy to a layby where he anally raped him over the front seat. He <b>said</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> finished he panicked and then strangled the boy with his own school tie, he kept the body in his car's boot for several days before dumping him in woodland.|$|E

500|$|The game's {{dialogue}} {{system was}} inspired by Shin Megami Tensei (1992), particularly the gameplay mechanic whereby players can talk to monsters to avoid conflict. Fox intended to expand upon this mechanic, as failing to negotiate resulted in a requirement to fight. [...] "I {{want to create a}} system that satisfied my urge for talking to monsters," [...] he <b>said.</b> <b>When</b> <b>he</b> began developing this mechanic, the concept of completing the game without killing any enemies [...] "just evolved naturally". However, he never considered removing the option to fight throughout development. When questioned on the difficulty of playing the game without killing, Fox responded that it is [...] "the crux of one of the major themes of this game", asking players to think about it themselves.|$|E
500|$|Morrissey had {{specific}} {{instructions on how}} he wanted the [...] "Hand in Glove" [...] single to be packaged. He told Rough Trade's art department that the single should have a paper label centre with four vents encircling the middle, in homage to singles from the 1960s. The cover to the single features a photograph of George O'Mara by Jim French, taken from Margaret Walters' history The Nude Male. The sleeve's homoerotic undertones elicited the reaction Morrissey was hoping for of unease and outrage. Rourke <b>said</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> showed the recording to his parents his father was [...] "mortified. He said to me, 'that's a bloke's bum' and I said, 'yeah' but when he asked me why I just didn't {{have an answer for}} him".|$|E
500|$|The {{members of}} the band {{reportedly}} spent afternoons getting stoned and watching Three Stooges reruns. One day, they had a post-Stooges meeting {{to try to come}} up with a name. Kramer <b>said</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was in school he would write the word aerosmith all over his notebooks. The name had popped into his head after listening to Harry Nilsson's album Aerial Ballet, which featured jacket art of a circus performer jumping out of a biplane. Initially, Kramer's bandmates were unimpressed; they all thought he was referring to the Sinclair Lewis novel they were required to read in high school English class. [...] "No, not Arrowsmith," [...] Kramer explained. [...] "A-E-R-O...Aerosmith." [...] The band settled upon this name after also considering [...] "the Hookers" [...] and [...] "Spike Jones." ...|$|E

500|$|Both Willis and Motley {{retired after}} the 1953 season. Willis was 32 {{years old and}} had played eight seasons for the Browns, earning all-pro honors every year he played. He was the best player on a strong defense that was crucial to Cleveland's success in the AAFC and NFL. He was also the {{embodiment}} of what Brown looked for in his players: speed and intelligence instead of size. At around 210 pounds, he was small for a lineman, even in his era. Willis's play as a powerful but quick middle guard influenced the development of the modern linebacker position. [...] "In my opinion Bill ranks as one of the outstanding linemen in the history of professional football", Brown <b>said</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> retired. [...] "He certainly was the fastest and many coaches use his technique as a model in teaching line play." ...|$|E
500|$|Unemployment {{originally}} {{rose from}} 4.2percent in January 2001 to 6.3percent in June 2003, but subsequently dropped to 4.5percent as of July 2007. Adjusted for inflation, {{median household income}} dropped by $1,175 between 2000 and 2007, while Professor Ken Homa of Georgetown University has noted that [...] "Median real after-tax household income went up 2 percent". The poverty rate increased from 11.3percent in 2000 to 12.3percent in 2006 after peaking at 12.7percent in 2004. By October 2008, due to increases in spending, the national debt had risen to $11.3trillion, an increase of over 100percent from 2000 when the debt was only $5.6trillion. Most debt was accumulated {{as a result of}} what became known as the [...] "Bush tax cuts" [...] and increased national security spending. In March 2006, then-Senator Barack Obama <b>said</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> voted against raising the debt ceiling: [...] "The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure." [...] By the end of Bush's presidency, unemployment climbed to 7.2percent.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} on The John and Ken Show on KFI, Headley {{was asked if he}} experienced retaliation from Scientology for speaking critically about the organization. He said that he had been issued a declaration that he was to be considered a [...] "Suppressive Person" [...] by members of the organization, and explained, [...] "That's basically the thing that goes out to anyone and everyone who is in Scientology, saying, 'This person is a Suppressive Person, and you can no longer speak to him ever again.' If you are in Scientology, and you speak to somebody who is a Suppressive Person, you yourself can be declared a Suppressive Person." [...] Headley <b>said</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> left Scientology the organization gave him a [...] "freeloader statement", a bill for US$62,000, for courses he had received in Scientology. [...] "It's actually illegal, because they are basically charging me for on-the-job training – in California you can't charge somebody for on-the-job training. It's of no real value, but you don't know that, when you're in Scientology. You think, 'Are they going to garnish my wages, are they going to sue me?' You don't know," [...] said Headley.|$|E

500|$|According to Cynthia Lennon, {{when the}} group walked past the Maharishi {{on the way to}} their taxis he looked [...] "very biblical and {{isolated}} in his faith". The Maharishi reportedly said, [...] "Wait, talk to me". After leaving the ashram, the taxis kept breaking down, leading the Beatles to wonder if the Maharishi had placed a curse on them. The car that the Lennons were in suffered a flat tyre and the driver left them, apparently to find a replacement tyre, but did not return for hours. After it grew dark the Lennons hitchhiked a ride to Delhi and took the first available flight back to London, during which John drunkenly recounted a litany of his numerous infidelities to Cynthia. The Harrisons were not ready to go home, so they travelled to other Indian cities and spent time with Ravi Shankar. Harrison <b>said</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> got dysentery he thought it might have been due to a spell cast by the Maharishi, but he recovered after Shankar gave him some amulets. Harrison later said he had never intended to stay for {{the second half of the}} course in Kashmir and that he thought Lennon wanted to get back to his relationship with Ono.|$|E
500|$|John Bishop {{has been}} the most vocal {{supporter}} of treating Finnegans Wake absolutely, in every sense, as a description of a dream, the dreamer, and of the night itself; arguing that the book not only represents a dream in an abstract conception, but is fully a literary representation of sleep. On the subject Bishop writes: [...] The greatest obstacle to our comprehension of Finnegans Wake [...] the failure on the part of readers to believe that Joyce really meant what he <b>said</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> spoke of the book as a [...] "reconstruction of the nocturnal life" [...] and an [...] "imitation of the dream-state"; and as a consequence readers have perhaps too easily exercised on the text an unyielding literalism bent on finding a kind of meaning in every way antithetical to the kind of meaning purveyed in dreams [...] Bishop has also somewhat brought back into fashion the theory that the Wake is about a single sleeper; arguing that it is not [...] "the 'universal dream' of some disembodied global everyman, but a reconstruction of the night – and a single night – as experienced by 'one stable somebody' whose 'earwitness' on the real world is coherently chronological." [...] Bishop has laid the path for critics such as Eric Rosenbloom, who has proposed that the book [...] "elaborates the fragmentation and reunification of identity during sleep. The masculine [...] mind of the day has been overtaken by the feminine night mind. [...] The characters live in the transformation and flux of a dream, embodying the sleeper’s mind." ...|$|E
500|$|Since {{the trial}} had {{received}} national attention, Brownsville officials were expecting {{a large crowd}} of spectators and reporters in the courtroom. In order to accommodate them, the trial was moved from the 357th State District Court to the 197th State District courtroom. On February 25, 1994, the jury examined the evidence from the bullet remains, the motel records, and photos of Fischer's corpse. His brother Eric took the stand and described what he saw and heard the morning his brother was killed. He <b>said</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> heard the two gunshots, he looked {{through the window and}} saw a white car driving away. A member of the Cuellar organization, Victor Moreno, testified in court and helped investigators connect the murder to members of the criminal group. He stated that Olivarez, Puentes Pizaña, and Palomares worked for Cuellar and were behind the murder. He also said he spoke with Garza about [...] "a murder" [...] in Brownsville, and claimed to have been with Cuellar when Palomares called him to tell him about the murder of [...] "a boy" [...] in Brownsville. Moreno allegedly gave money to Garza to but the gun in Dallas on Cuellar's behalf. After the purchase, Moreno gave the gun to Cuellar, who then reportedly gave it to the assassins. The defense stated that even if, for argument's sake, Moreno's testimony was true it was inadmissible because he was not involved in the murder. However, the court concluded that he was integral to the process that led to Fischer's murder, and admitted his testimony citing a co-conspirator hearsay exception.|$|E
