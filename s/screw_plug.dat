5000|$|One {{solution}} to this for side-valve engines was to place a <b>screwed</b> <b>plug</b> directly above each valve, and to access the valves through this (illustrated). The tapered threads of the <b>screwed</b> <b>plug</b> provided a reliable seal. For low-powered engines this was a popular solution for some years. It was difficult to cool this plug, as the water jacket didn't extend into the plug. As performance increased, it also became important to have better combustion chamber designs with less [...] "dead space". One solution was to place the spark plug in the centre of this plug, which at least made use of the space. However this also placed the spark plug further away from the main combustion chamber, leading to long flame paths and slower ignition.|$|R
40|$|Augmented Reality (AR) {{points out}} to be a good {{technology}} for training in the field of maintenance and assembly, as instructions or rather location-dependent information can be directly linked and/or attached to physical objects. Since objects to maintain usually contain a large number of similar components (e. g. <b>screws,</b> <b>plugs,</b> etc.) the provision of location-dependent information is vitally important. Another advantage is that AR-based training takes place with the real physical devices of the training scenario. Thus, the trainee also practices the real use of the tools whereby the corresponding sensorimotor skills are trained. ...|$|R

50|$|The burner of the Wells light used a {{vaporiser}} that heated the oil {{before it}} escaped the nozzle, so vaporising immediately. As the lamp {{was intended for}} use with heavy, sooty oils as well, this vaporiser was constructed of a square frame of straight tubes. Each tube was closed with a <b>screwed</b> <b>plug</b> that could be removed for cleaning. For initial lighting, the vaporiser would be preheating by burning a little oil in a tray beneath the burner. The burners were mounted horizontally, although some models were produced with a flexible hose to the burner that allowed it to be rotated vertically.|$|R

50|$|Threaded {{plug valves}} are used {{significantly}} in air-sensitive chemistry {{as well as}} when a vessel must be closed completely {{as in the case}} of Schlenk bombs. The construction of a threaded plug valve involves a plug with a threaded cap which are made so that they fit with the threading on a corresponding piece of female glass. <b>Screwing</b> the <b>plug</b> in part-way first engages one or more O-rings, made of rubber or plastic, near the plug's base, which seals the female joint off from the outer atmosphere. <b>Screwing</b> the <b>plug</b> valve all the way in engages the plug's tip with a beveled constriction in the glass, which provides a second seal. This seal separates the region beyond the bevel and the O-rings already mentioned.|$|R
50|$|Various breech-loading flintlocks were {{developed}} starting around 1650. The most popular action has a barrel which was unscrewed {{from the rest}} of the gun. Obviously this is more practical on pistols because of the shorter barrel length. This type is known as a Queen Anne pistol because it was during her reign that it became popular (although it was actually introduced in the reign of King William III). Another type has a removable <b>screw</b> <b>plug</b> set into the side or top or bottom of the barrel. A large number of sporting rifles were made with this system, as it allowed easier loading compared with muzzle loading with a tight fitting bullet and patch.|$|E
50|$|Fig 4 shows a 10-inch {{studless}} Palliser shell Mk II {{with automatic}} gas-check. The gas-check {{is the same}} as the one in Fig 3. However, in contrast to Fig 3, the protrusion on the base of the shell in Fig 4 is not part of the shell, but is instead a wrought iron disc attached to the shell by the <b>screw</b> <b>plug.</b> Initially, all studless shells 9 - 17.72 inches, including Palliser shells, were made in one piece as in Fig 3. These shells were identified as Mark I. However, it was found that casting Palliser shells in brittle metal in one piece was extremely difficult, especially for smaller calibres, and that the protusions were liable to chipping during handling. As a result, later Palliser shells 9 - 12.5 inches were made in two pieces as in Fig 4, and identified as Mark II. The separate protrusions were made from wrought iron, cast steel or malleable cast iron.|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveBronchopleural fistula is a {{critical}} complication that may occur after pulmonary resection. Early closure of the fistula is required to prevent thoracic empyema or aspiration pneumonia. We have designed a novel procedure for bronchoscopic occlusion of the fistula with a collagen <b>screw</b> <b>plug</b> and assessed its feasibility in an experimental animal model. MethodsAdult beagle dogs underwent right or left pneumonectomy, and the bronchial stump was closed with the Sweet method. A silicone bar (2 mm in diameter) was then placed {{in the middle of}} the bronchial stump. Seven days after the operation, the silicone bar was removed bronchoscopically, and fistula formation was confirmed. A screw-shaped 2 % collagen <b>screw</b> <b>plug</b> (20 mm long and 3 mm in diameter) was mounted at the end of a modified endoscopic cannula and then inserted into the fistula. Autologous platelet-rich plasma was then soaked onto the inserted plug. ResultsNine of 10 beagle dogs with bronchopleural fistula were treated successfully by plug occlusion. One dog died of pneumothorax caused by dislocation of the plug. Pathologic examination revealed that the collagen sponge had been replaced by fibrous tissue and that the fistula was covered with normal epithelium. Although soaking with platelet-rich plasma made the plug airtight immediately, the use of platelet-rich plasma seemed to make no distinct difference with respect to the treatment result or pathologic findings. ConclusionBronchoscopic occlusion with a collagen <b>screw</b> <b>plug</b> is a promising option for treatment of small bronchopleural fistulas after pulmonary surgery...|$|E

40|$|Unbleached {{kraft pulp}} for making sack paper is usually first refined {{in a high}} {{consistency}} process followed by low consistency refining {{in order to achieve}} desired paper properties, such as high strain at break and high tensile energy absorption at low airflow resistance. Conventional atmospheric high consistency refining is compared to treatments using two types of compressive screw equipment, Bivis equipment and the pressure expansion (PREX) <b>plug</b> <b>screw</b> feeder, commonly used in thermo mechanical pulp (TMP) plants. The <b>plug</b> <b>screw</b> pretreatments were performed under atmospheric and steam-pressurised conditions at 120 °C and 130 °C. Treatment in the Bivis equipment was performed under different compressive and shear conditions. After the Bivis and <b>plug</b> <b>screw</b> treatments, the pulp samples were refined in a low consistency process using the Escher-Wyss refiner. Paper properties were evaluated on freely dried sheets which were produced in order to simulate paper made under industrial sack paper drying conditions. The highest levels of the tensile energy absorption index and strain at break were achieved from curled and kinked fibres, pre-treated under the most compressive and highest shear stress conditions before low consistency refining. These results were obtained at very low airflow resistance, which is advantageous for sack paper, and with very low energy consumption during pre-treatment with the <b>plug</b> <b>screw.</b> The pulp samples pre-treated at high consistency in a <b>plug</b> <b>screw</b> feeder under steam-pressurised conditions or in the Bivis equipment showed, after low consistency refining, increased shrinking ability compared to the pulp samples pre-treated in high consistency refining under atmospheric conditions...|$|R

40|$|High {{pressure}} <b>screw</b> <b>plug</b> (also called breech lock) exchangers are {{arguably the}} most complicated bolted connection in a refinery. After traveling around the world helping facilities turn these exchangers from chronic leakers (from internal tubesheet and external diaphragm and B style shell leaks) {{to one of the}} most reliable heat exchangers in the plant, it is very clear to me that manufacturers, engineers and mechanics struggle to correctly understand the interactions between gaskets, internal pressure, the two circles of external push bolts that are part of A style exchangers and all the internal parts. Some manufactuers have given up on trying to make these connections operate leak free, and prefer to weld in the tubesheets and diaphragms. This significantly adds to the cost and time needed to open and close these exchangers, as special equipment is needed to machine out the parts and weld them back together again. There are a handful of equipment manufacturers that build these exchangers, and while there are differences from one manufacturer to the next, once the basic design is understood, the reader should be able understand that they are all basically the same when it comes to the few critical steps that must be followed when opening and closing these exchangers. In order to obtain reliable leak free performance, all the basic sealing tools must be employed, including: 1. A spreadsheet that will easily analyze the critical variables; 2. Correct gasket selection; 3. Correct assembly procedures that focus on important steps including proper spacing of internal parts and obtaining consistent thread friction; 4. And finally hot torqueing the exchangers after startup. The goal of this paper to provide the end-user with a good understanding for how parts interact and how the bolted connections function, so that they might also achieve reliable, leak free performance.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{possibility}} of decreasing the sheet density of paper made from unbleached kraft pulp for the middle layer in board production. The objective was to evaluate how treatments in a compressive screw equipment pressure expansion (PREX) <b>plug</b> <b>screw</b> feeder, atmospheric (HCatm) and pressurised high-consistency refining (HCpress refining) affect both fibre and paper properties and, in particular, how fibre curl affects sheet density. The <b>plug</b> <b>screw</b> pre-treatments and HC refining were performed under atmospheric and steam-pressurised conditions at 100 degrees C, 125 degrees C and 175 degrees C. Even though fibre curl increased considerably during <b>plug</b> <b>screw</b> treatment and HCatm and HCpress refining, {{the density of the}} paper sheets did not decrease, as had been expected. A possible explanation for this result may be that the fibres become more flexible during curl treatment, resulting in increased sheet density. In order to obtain fibres that were both very curly and stiff, three ways of improving the fibre stiffness were tested: 1) lowering the pH during refining, 2) drying the fibres (hornification) and 3) treating the fibres with 1, 2, 3, 4 -ButaneTetraCarboxylic Acid (BTCA). If the fibres are dried (hornified), there is a lowering effect on sheet density. However, fibre curl does not have any lowering effect on sheet density. If the pH is decreased during <b>plug</b> <b>screw</b> treatment, the sheet density may be reduced but, again, the fibre curl does not have any positive effect on sheet density. Fibres treated with BTCA had a marked lowering effect on sheet density. With this treatment, the fibre curl does {{have a positive effect on}} sheet density. The BTCA-treated fibres were also used to lower sheet density. A mixture of 15 % by weight BTCA- treated fibres resulted in an approximately 9 % density reduction...|$|R
