5|$|Propagation is by seed or {{cuttings}} of hardened growth {{less than}} a year old. The seed can be collected from the cones and stored; they are best sown in <b>spring</b> <b>or</b> autumn. The stems and flowers are long-lasting if put in water. The flowers, cones and foliage are used in the cut-flower industry.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} {{coronation}} {{and the establishment}} of Christian institutions would take two years. Internal conflicts persisted; during the <b>spring</b> <b>or</b> summer of 1251, Tautvilas and his remaining allies attacked Mindaugas's warriors and the Livonian Order's crossbow-men in Voruta Castle. The attack failed, and Tautvilas' forces retreated to defend themselves in Tviremet Castle (presumed to be Tverai in Samogitia). Vykintas died in 1251 or 1252, and Tautvilas was forced to rejoin Daniel of Galicia.|$|E

5|$|Archibald {{and colleagues}} {{suggested}} that the behavioural habits for Myrmeciites ants, like that of other extinct Myrmeciinae taxa, may have been similar to its extant relatives. Workers would forage onto trees or vegetation to capture arthropod prey or to feed on nectar, soiling either in the ground or in the trees, making them an arboreal nesting insect. Like other Myrmeciine ants, Myrmeciites most likely did not lay pheromone trails or recruit nestmates to food sources; these ants may have been solitary foragers, relying on their eyes to hunt for prey and for navigational purposes. The nuptial flight of M. (?) tabanifluviensis probably occurred during the late <b>spring</b> <b>or</b> summer, as in extant relatives.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{appear to}} moult {{once a year}} in <b>spring</b> <b>or</b> summer, {{although}} observations have been limited. Young birds spend about a year in juvenile plumage before moulting into adult plumage at around a year old. Juvenile birds have more brown-tinged and uniform plumage; the darker colour around the lores and eyes are less distinct. Their blackish bill is yellow-tipped, and the gape is yellow. Their eyes are brownish, but turn yellow early. The exact timing is unknown but likely to be around four months of age.|$|E

5|$|During {{the winter}} the English murdered Earl William and Robert fitz Richard, the {{custodian}} {{of the new}} castle at York, and trapped William Malet, the first Norman sheriff of York, in the castle. King William went north in the <b>spring</b> <b>or</b> summer of 1069, relieved the siege of Malet, and restored the castle, placing William fitz Osbern in charge. The leaders of the revolt were Edgar the Ætheling (claimant to the English throne), Gospatric of Northumbria, and, among others, Mærle-Sveinn, former sheriff of Lincoln, and many senior Northumbria nobles.|$|E
5|$|In spring 1537, Montejo sent {{reinforcements}} to Cáceres, who {{was still}} in the fertile Valley of Comayagua. By late <b>spring</b> <b>or</b> early summer, the valley had been completely conquered. In December 1537, under orders from Montejo, Alonso de Cáceres founded the town of Santa María de Comayagua; it was sited in a strategic position half-way between the Caribbean and Pacific coasts. Cáceres then distributed the Indian settlements in encomienda. He collected reinforcements from Gracias a Dios, then returned immediately to Comayagua, and began to push eastwards towards Olancho.|$|E
5|$|Large parties trimmed the cut stems, {{and left}} them to dry for days or weeks. As well as stems, the rhizomes—extensions of the trunk {{below the surface of}} the ground shaped like {{enormous}} carrots—were also dug up to be cooked. In the early 1840s, Edward Shortland said Māori preferred rhizomes from trees growing in deep rich soil. They dug them in <b>spring</b> <b>or</b> early summer just before the flowering of the plant, when they were at their sweetest. November was the favourite month for preparing kāuru in the South Island.|$|E

5|$|Lodges {{are grouped}} into {{sections}} that are then grouped into regions. The section chief is the elected youth leader, a volunteer adult is appointed as the section adviser, {{and the area}} director (or his designate) is the professional (staff) adviser. In addition to the section chief, the section has two additional elected officers. The vice chief and secretary are elected immediately following {{the election of the}} section chief at the section's annual business meeting. All sections gather annually at a section conclave held in the late <b>spring</b> <b>or</b> early fall. The section officers lead the planning of this weekend {{with the help of the}} lodge chiefs in the section.|$|E
5|$|Nestlings, fledglings, and juveniles have brown plumage and pink-brown {{bills with}} shorter tails than adults. Young males develop blue tail {{feathers}} and darker bills by late summer or autumn (following a <b>spring</b> <b>or</b> summer breeding season), while young females develop light blue tails. By the subsequent spring, all males are fertile and have developed cloacal protuberances, which store sperm. In contrast, during the breeding season, fertile females develop oedematous brood patches, which are bare areas on their bellies.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} in Eriophorum angustifolium {{begins with}} flowering in <b>spring</b> <b>or</b> early summer (in or around May), when groups of 3–5 brown flowers are produced. Fertilisation usually {{takes place in}} May or June, via anemophily (wind-pollination), and the white bristle-like perianth, composed of achenes with pappi (seeds with hairs) then grows outwards to appear like short tufts of cotton thread. These pappi endure well into summer, lasting from around June to September. Like the pappus of Taraxacum (dandelions), this aids in wind-dispersal, and also serves as thermal insulation, conserving {{the temperature of the}} plant's reproductive organs by trapping solar radiation.|$|E

5|$|The diet of {{the sand}} devil {{consists}} mainly of small teleost fishes and squid, which are captured via ambush attack. This species is viviparous, with the unborn young nourished by their yolk sacs. Females have a multi-year reproductive cycle and give birth to 4–25 pups in <b>spring</b> <b>or</b> early summer, following a 12-month gestation period. The sand devil is not aggressive, but may attempt to bite if harassed or captured. Though not valued economically, it is caught incidentally by commercial bottom trawl fisheries. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks sufficient information to assess the conservation status of this species.|$|E
5|$|The {{rebellion}} {{broke out}} in the <b>spring</b> <b>or</b> summer of 1277 in north-eastern Bulgaria where the Mongol devastation was strongest. In the summer of 1277 Ivaylo confronted and defeated a plundering Mongol unit. Another victory followed soon and by autumn all Mongols were driven out of Bulgarian territory. Having achieved what had eluded the Bulgarian arms for decades, his popularity and reputation rose quickly. Among his followers were an increasing number of nobles who were discontent with the intrigues of Empress Maria. Ivaylo was hailed as Emperor by the people and many regions came under his control.|$|E
5|$|Blacknose sharks feed {{primarily}} on small bony fishes and cephalopods, {{and in turn}} fall prey to larger sharks. Like other members of their family, they exhibit a viviparous mode of reproduction in which the developing embryos are sustained by a placental connection. The females give birth to three to six young in late <b>spring</b> <b>or</b> early summer, either annually or biennually, after a gestation period of eight to 11 months. This species is not known to attack humans, though {{it has been documented}} performing a threat display towards divers. It is of moderate commercial and recreational importance. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this species as Near Threatened. In 2009, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced the populations of the blacknose shark off the United States are being overfished, and proposed new conservation measures.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{election}} loss Dosanjh returned to practicing law {{and let his}} party membership lapse. There had been speculation dating back to October 2002 that Dosanjh was interested in joining the Liberal Party of Canada. New Democratic Party leader Jack Layton approached Dosanjh in 2003 {{to see if he}} was interested in running as a federal candidate but Dosanjh refused. In March 2004, with a federal election expected in the <b>spring</b> <b>or</b> summer, Prime Minister Paul Martin approached Dosanjh to be a candidate for the Liberal Party of Canada. Dosanjh agreed and Martin appointed him to Vancouver South over two other nomination candidates while announcing Dosanjh as part of a team of BC star candidates along with economist David Emerson, union leader Dave Haggard, community activist Shirley Chan and Liberal party organizer Bill Cunningham. The advertising of Dosanjh emphasized the party's socially progressive aspect. In the June election Dosanjh won his riding with 44.5% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|Geastrum triplex is a {{saprobic}} fungus: it derives {{nutrients from}} decomposing organic matter. The fruit bodies are usually found growing singly or more commonly in groups in hardwood forests where much humus has accumulated; in Mexico, {{they have been}} collected in tropical deciduous forest. Fruit bodies are often found around well-rotted tree stumps; they are initially almost buried in the loose duff, but emerge during maturity as the downward curling of the rays exposes the spore sac. Old fruit bodies are persistent, and may survive the winter to be found the following <b>spring</b> <b>or</b> summer. A Dutch study reported a propensity for G.triplex to grow on soil made calcium-rich from washed-out chalk of crushed shells on bicycling paths. It is described as common in North America and Europe. One author states it is commonly found under beech trees.|$|E
5|$|Like other requiem sharks, {{the milk}} shark is viviparous; females {{usually have a}} single {{functional}} ovary (on the left) and two functional uteruses divided into separate compartments for each embryo. The details of its life history vary across different parts of its range. Females generally produce young every year, though some give birth every other year or even every third year. Mating and parturition take place in <b>spring</b> <b>or</b> early summer (April to July) off western and southern Africa, and in winter off India, Alternately, off Oman parturition occurs year-round with a peak in spring. Parturition also occurs continuously in Australian waters; in the Herald Bight of Shark Bay, the number of newborns peaks in April and again in July. One proposed explanation {{for the lack of}} reproductive seasonality in these subpopulations is a lengthier and/or more complex reproductive cycle than has been detected (such as a period of dormancy in embryonic development, though there is presently no evidence of this occurring). Females do not store sperm internally.|$|E
