40|$|Abstract—Electromagnetic {{transducers}} {{have been}} used extensively for active feedback control of mechanical vibration. In this paper, to reduce vibration, we demonstrate a new technique where an electrical impedance {{is connected to the}} terminals of an electromagnetic transducer. By measuring the coil terminal voltage and applying a related current, or vice-versa, vibration in the mechanical host system can be controlled. The task of impedance design is cast as a standard multi-input–multi-output (MIMO) control problem to facilitate synthesis by standard methods such as linear quadratic regulator (LQR) or 2. Potential applications include: vehicle suspension systems, vibration isolation platforms, and the control of enclosed-sound fields. Active admittance or impedance controllers require no external sensors. The presented techniques are verified experimentally through the application to a single-degree-of-freedom (DOF) system.

40|$|Abstract—Piezoelectric {{transducers}} {{are commonly}} used as strain actuators in the control of mechanical vibration. One control strategy, termed piezoelectric shunt damping, involves the connection of an electrical impedance to the terminals of a structurally bonded transducer. When subject to deflection, charge generated in the transducer flows through the external impedance developing a counteractive voltage across the terminals. Many passive, nonlinear, and semiactive impedance designs have been proposed that maximize this counteractive effect. This paper introduces a new technique for the design and implementation of piezoelectric shunt impedances. By considering the transducer voltage and charge as inputs and outputs, the design problem is reduced to a standard linear regulator problem enabling the application of standard synthesis techniques such as 2, and. The resulting impedance is extensible to multitransducer systems, is unrestricted in structure, and is capable of minimizing an arbitrary performance objective. Experimental comparison to a resonant shunt circuit is carried out on a cantilever beam. Previous problems such as ad hoc tuning, limited performance, and sensitivity to variation in structural resonance frequencies are significantly alleviated.

In this paper, an analytical study of parallel passive resistor-inductor (R-L) piezoelectric <b>vibration</b> <b>shunt</b> control on a beam structure by using the Hamilton&# 039;s principle, Galerkin&# 039;s method is presented. However, the efficiency of such vibration control method relies on the optimization of vibration energy transfer between a structure and piezoelectric material. In this paper, the strain energy transfer within the composite material, which is made of two layers of different materials, is analyzed. It indicates that neutral axis of the composite material has some influence on the optimization of the strain energy transfer between the structure and PZT. The passive <b>vibration</b> <b>shunt</b> control is sensitive to frequency shift of structures.

40|$|Electromechanical {{modeling}} {{efforts in}} the research field of vibration-based energy harvesting have been mostly focused on deterministic forms of vibrational input as in the typical case of harmonic excitation at resonance. However, ambient vibrational energy often has broader frequency content than a single harmonic, {{and in many cases}} it is entirely stochastic. As compared to the literature of harvesting deterministic forms of vibrational energy, few authors presented modeling approaches for energy harvesting from broadband random vibrations. These efforts have combined the input statistical information with the single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) dynamics of the energy harvester to express the electromechanical response characteristics. In most cases, the vibrational input is assumed to have broadband frequency content, such as white noise. White noise has a flat power spectral density (PSD) that might in fact excite higher vibration modes of an electroelastic energy harvester. In particular, cantilevered piezoelectric energy harvesters constitute such continuous electroelastic systems with more than one vibration mode. The main component of this thesis presents analytical and numerical electroelastic modeling, simulations, and experimental validations of piezoelectric energy harvesting from broadband random excitation. The modeling approach employed herein is based on distributed-parameter electroelastic formulation to ensure that the effects of higher vibration modes are included. The goal is to predict the expected value of the power output and the mean-square <b>shunted</b> <b>vibration</b> response in terms of the given PSD or time history of the random vibrational input. The analytical method is based on the PSD of random base excitation and distributed-parameter frequency response functions of the coupled voltage output and <b>shunted</b> <b>vibration</b> response. The first one of the two numerical solution methods employs the Fourier series representation of the base acceleration history in a Runge-Kutta-based ordinary differential equation solver while the second method uses an Euler-Maruyama scheme to directly solve the resulting electroelastic stochastic differential equations. The analytical and numerical simulations are compared with several experiments for a brass-reinforced PZT- 5 H cantilever bimorph under different random excitation levels. In addition to base-excited cantilevered configurations, energy harvesting using prismatic piezoelectric stack configurations is investigated. Electromechanical modeling and numerical simulations are given and validated through experiments for a multi-layer PZT- 5 H stack. After validating the electromechanical models for specific experimentally configurations and samples, various piezoelectric materials are compared theoretically for energy harvesting from random vibrations. Finally, energy harvesting from narrowband random vibrationsusing both configurations are investigated theoretically and experimentally. M. S...|$|R

The panel is excited by a rain-on-the-roof broad frequency band stationary disturbance. The absorbers are composed of piezoelectric patches connected to time-varying RL shunt circuits. Continuous, sweeping, variations over time of the shunts are implemented {{in such a way}} as to swing the resonance frequency and damping factor of the absorbers within certain ranges and in this way to reduce the resonant response of multiple flexural modes of the hosting plate. A single patch absorber implementing the sweeping shunt is first presented and its performance is compared to that of a classical patch absorber with time-invariant RL shunt. The same analysis is conducted for a multiple patch system using five shunted absorbers. The control performance is assessed considering the spectrum of the total flexural kinetic energy of the system in the 20 Hz to 1000 Hz frequency band.

40|$|The {{vibrations}} of a Cricket bat {{are traditionally}} passively damped by the inherent damping properties {{of wood and}} flat rubber panels located in {{the handle of the}} bat. This sort of passive damping is effective for the high frequency vibrations only and is not effective for the low frequency vibrations. Recently, the use of Smart materials for vibration control has become an alternative to the traditional vibration control techniques which are usually heavy and bulky, especially at low frequencies. In contrast, the vibration controls with Smart materials can target any particular frequency of vibration. This has advantages such as it results in smaller size, lighter weight, portability, and flexibility in the structure. This makes it particularly suitable for traditional techniques which cannot be applied due to weight and size restrictions.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} the design and implementation of a time-varying <b>shunted</b> electro-magnetic Tuneable <b>Vibration</b> Absorber for broad-band vibration control of thin structures. A time-varying RL-shunt is used to harmonically vary the stiffness and damping properties of the Tuneable Vibration Absorber so that its mechanical fundamental natural frequency is continuously swept in a given broad frequency band whereas its mechanical damping is continuously adapted to maximize the vibration absorption from the hosting structure where it is mounted. The paper first recalls the tuning and positioning criteria for the case where a classical Tuneable Vibration Absorber is installed on a thin walled cylindrical structure to reduce the response of a resonating flexural mode.

40|$|AbstractStructural {{control for}} civil {{structures}} was {{born out of}} a need to provide safer and more efficient designs with the reality of limited resources. The purpose of structural control is to absorb and to reflect the energy introduced by dynamic loads such as winds, waves, earthquakes, and traffic. Today, the protection of civil structures from severe dynamic loading is typically achieved by allowing the structures to be damaged. Semi-active control devices, also called “smart” control devices, assume the positive aspects of both the passive and active control devices. A semi-active control strategy is similar to the active control strategy. Only here, the control actuator does not directly apply force to the structure, but instead it is used to control the properties of a passive energy device, a controllable passive damper. Semi-active control strategies can be used in many of the same civil applications as passive and active control. One method of operating smart cable dampers is in a purely passive capacity, supplying the dampers with constant optimal voltage. The advantages to this strategy are the relative simplicity of implementing the control strategy as compared to a smart or active control strategy and that the dampers are more easily optimally tuned in- place, eliminating the need to have passive dampers with unique optimal damping coefficients. This research investigated semi-active control of civil structures for natural hazard mitigation. The research has two components, the seismic protection of buildings and the mitigation of wind-induced vibration in structures. An ideal semi-active motion equation of a composite beam that consists of a cantilever beam bonded with a PZT patch using Hamilton's principle and Galerkin's method was treated.

The inductive shunt damping is notorious {{for not being}} robust when the natural frequency of the electrical circuit does not match the natural frequency of the structure. In the proposed implementation, the shunted piezoelectric transducer is supplemented with a small additional one (with open electrodes) measuring the mechanical extension of the structure {{at the location of}} the transducer. The adaptation strategy uses the property that, at resonance, the electric charge in the shunted transducer is in quadrature of phase with the mechanical strain at the location of the transducer (i. e. the voltage in the transducer with open electrodes). A Phase Shift to Voltage Converter, inspired from the Phase Locked Loop technique (PLL), is built to evaluate the phase shift between these two signals and to adapt the (synthetic) inductor L via a voltage controlled resistor, involving a photoresistive optoisolator (photoresistor).
