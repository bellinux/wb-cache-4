For these applications to fully engage people they must build trust relationships {{in a natural}} manner. We hypothesize {{that the use of}} an explicit trust model {{in the design of the}} application would improve the rate at which trust is generated. To investigate this hypothesis, we have taken as a case study the design of a <b>shopping</b> <b>guide</b> <b>for</b> a local trading association. We have created an explicit trust model and incorporated this into our design. We have evaluated both our model and our application. The results of this confirmed our hypothesis and provided additional insight into how to model trust in the design of applications...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{gluten-free}} cookbooks on the market, but none like Goodbye Gluten! Roughly one-third {{of people in}} the U. S. are either gluten intolerant or have celiac disease, and for these people, eating gluten can make them sick—very sick. The engaging team of Kim Stanford and Bill Backhaus represents both these audiences, and together they have developed over 200 flavorful and tempting recipes for all types of dishes, from appetizers to desserts. Goodbye Gluten is both a cookbook and <b>shopping</b> <b>guide</b> <b>for</b> people who do not want gluten in their diets and are tired of missing out on their favorite foods. In each recipe the authors use everyday brand names that can be found at your local grocery store, which means you no longer have to check labels to decipher if a product is gluten-free. Another appeal of the book is its use of Texas and Tex-Mex flavors to add a kick to what can be bland fare. Goodbye Gluten makes it easy to live the gluten-free lifestyle, because {{it is not just a}} diet, but a lifestyle. With 30 color photos of the completed dishes, even the most dedicated bread-lover will want to get into the kitchen and start cooking...|$|E
