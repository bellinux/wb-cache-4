5|$|In 1912 Neubronner {{completed}} his task (set in 1909) of photographing the waterworks at Tegel using only his mobile dovecote. Almost 10 years of negotiations {{were scheduled to}} end in August 1914 with a practical test at a maneuver in Strasbourg, followed by the state's acquisition of the invention. These plans were thwarted by {{the outbreak of the}} war. Neubronner had to provide all his pigeons and equipment to the military, which tested them in the battlefield with <b>satisfactory</b> <b>results,</b> but did not employ the technique more widely.|$|E
5|$|Propagation both by {{seed and}} {{cuttings}} is difficult, reducing potential production by plant nurseries. Germination rates of soil-stored seeds {{have been found}} to increase substantially with the application of heat and aqueous solutions of smoke. The most <b>satisfactory</b> <b>results</b> from cuttings can be achieved by using tip growth, taken six weeks after the cessation of flowering, and kept under a fogging system for twenty weeks. Plantsman Neil Marriott recommends semi-hardened cutting material taken in spring and autumn. Roots of cuttings are brittle and easily damaged.|$|E
5|$|In east–west relations, Douglas-Home {{continued}} his policy {{of keeping the}} Soviet Union at bay. In September 1971, after receiving no <b>satisfactory</b> <b>results</b> from negotiations with Gromyko about the flagrant activities of the KGB in Britain, he expelled 105 Soviet diplomats for spying. In addition to the furore arising from this, the Soviets felt that the British government's approach to negotiations on détente in Europe was over-cautious, even sceptical. Gromyko was nonetheless realistic enough to maintain a working relationship with the British government. Within days of the expulsions from London he and Douglas-Home met and discussed the Middle East and disarmament. In this sphere of foreign policy, Douglas-Home was widely judged a success.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{resettlement}} of Svalbard in {{the early}} 20th century, coal mining has been the dominant commercial activity. Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani, {{a subsidiary of the}} Norwegian Ministry of Trade and Industry, operates Svea Nord in Sveagruva and Mine 7 in Longyearbyen. The former produced 3.4 million tonnes in 2008, while the latter uses 35% of its output to Longyearbyen Power Station. Since 2007, there has not been any significant mining by the Russian state-owned Arktikugol in Barentsburg. There have previously been performed test drilling for petroleum on land, but these did not give <b>satisfactory</b> <b>results</b> for permanent operation. The Norwegian authorities do not allow offshore petroleum activities for environmental reasons, and the land formerly test-drilled on has been protected as natural reserves or national parks. In 2011, a 20-year plan to develop offshore oil and gas resources around Svalbard was announced.|$|E

25|$|Heavy {{industry}} received {{major economic}} support during the 1950s. Although {{the labor force}} was traditionally skilled and efficient, inadequate incentives for labor and management contributed to high labor turnover, low productivity, and poor product quality.

40|$|Background: Newborn hearing {{screening}} {{is currently}} replacing the health visitor distraction test (HVDT) conducted at eight months. Our previous {{research indicates that}} recall for further tests following newborn hearing screening can {{have a negative impact}} on the emotional well being of mothers, but it is not known if this is greater than that caused by recall following the distraction test. Objective: To compare the impact on maternal anxiety and satisfaction of recall following newborn hearing screening and the HVDT. Methods: Four groups participated: 27 mothers of babies receiving a <b>satisfactory</b> <b>result</b> and 21 mothers of babies recalled after the HVDT 26 mothers of babies receiving a <b>satisfactory</b> <b>result</b> and 16 mothers of babies recalled after newborn hearing screening. Questionnaires assessing maternal anxiety, worry and certainty about the babies' hearing, satisfaction with and attitudes towards the screening test were sent to mothers three weeks and six months following screening. Results: Comparison of the effects of receipt of different results showed no significant differences in maternal anxiety, worry and certainty between the two tests. Those mothers whose babies had a newborn hearing screening test were significantly more satisfied, regardless of the result received. Those who received a <b>satisfactory</b> <b>result</b> on the newborn hearing screening programme also had more positive attitudes towards that screening test than those receiving a <b>satisfactory</b> <b>result</b> following the HVDT. Conclusion: These results suggest that newborn hearing screening does not have a more negative emotional impact than the HVDT...|$|R

The Ku-band antenna was deployed and the self-test was completed with <b>satisfactory</b> <b>results.</b> CAPCOM astronaut Barry Wilmore radioed the crew from mission control in Houston, reporting that a preliminary analysis found {{no signs of}} any significant debris or impact damage during the ascent. Commander Ferguson and Pilot Hurley also powered up the Shuttle's Robotic Arm and checked its functions ahead of next day's planned thermal protection survey.|$|E
25|$|The {{change to}} colour {{production}} also necessitated {{changes to the}} program's opening titles. Designer Bernard Lodge, who had produced the previous sets of titles used up until Spearhead from Space, originally intended to produce a new set using the same 'howlaround' technique that he had for the previous titles. Tests showed, however, that the technique did not produce <b>satisfactory</b> <b>results</b> when used with colour equipment and so the final set were produced {{in black and white}} before being manually tinted. These were completed in August 1969, a month before work began on the serial.|$|E
25|$|Owing to {{increased}} demands for higher wages by coffee pickers in rural areas, Salvadoran land {{owners in the}} countryside {{felt the need to}} create a special public security force to protect their interests. Previous law enforcement and task force efforts failed to yield <b>satisfactory</b> <b>results.</b> The task forces were patrolling soldiers, commanded by an army officer, scattered throughout the country. They were unprepared in the fight against crime in its various guises, and were thus incapable of stopping thefts, killings, rapes and so on. Criminals of that era were using topographical features to hide from the authorities.|$|E
40|$|Arthroscopic {{decompression}} and cuff debridement {{was performed}} on 47 cases in 45 consecutive patients with either stage II or stage III impingement syndrome: 19 with no actual tear of the cuff (stage II); 13 with a partial thickness tear (stage IIIa); 10 with complete tear less than 3 cm long (stage IIIb); and 5 with complete tear longer than 3 cm (stage IIIc). Patients were classified into impingement syndrome without tear (Group I), impingement syndrome with partial thickness tear (Group II), and impingement syndrome with full thickness tear (Group III). Group I had 19 cases, group II had 13 cases, and group III had 15 cases. Patients were followed up {{for an average of}} 39. 3 months (24 approximately 62 months). In group I, postoperative UCLA ratings improved in 18 cases (95 %) to <b>satisfactory</b> <b>result</b> rate. In group II, 11 patients (85 %) had improvement to <b>satisfactory</b> <b>result</b> rate. In group III, 12 cases (80 %) had improvement to <b>satisfactory</b> <b>result</b> rate. The arthroscopic subacromial decompression and rotator cuff debridement was effective in the treatment of subacromial impingement syndrome...|$|R

25|$|Bell's {{first patent}} {{was for a}} machine to print six colours at once, but, owing {{probably}} to its incomplete development, this was not immediately successful, although {{the principle of the}} method was shown to be practical by the printing of one colour with perfectly <b>satisfactory</b> <b>results.</b> The difficulty was to keep the six rollers, each carrying a portion of the pattern, in perfect register with each other. This defect was soon overcome by Adam Parkinson of Manchester, and in 1785, the year of its invention, Bell's machine with Parkinson's improvement was successfully employed by Messrs Livesey, Hargreaves and Company of Bamber Bridge, Preston, for the printing of calico in from two to six colours at a single operation. Danny Sayers helped.|$|E
25|$|The GameCube, {{released}} in 2001, is another 3D-capable system. With an LCD attachment, it could display true stereoscopic 3D, though only the launch title Luigi's Mansion was ever designed to utilize it. Due to the expensive {{nature of the}} requisite peripheral technology at the time, the GameCube's 3D functionality was never marketed to the public. Nintendo later experimented with a 3D LCD during development of the Game Boy Advance SP, but the idea was shelved after it failed to achieve <b>satisfactory</b> <b>results.</b> Another attempt was made {{in preparation for a}} virtual navigation guide to be used on the Nintendo DS at Shigureden, an interactive museum in Japan. Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi encouraged additional 3D research in an effort to use the technology in the exhibition. Although the project fell short, Nintendo was able to collect valuable research on liquid crystal which would later aid {{in the development of the}} Nintendo 3DS.|$|E

After the failure of Come Closer Tarkan decided to release a new, Turkish album and in the beginning of 2007 he declared that he was working on new songs. However, release dates were continuously being postponed. The Turkish daily Hürriyet reported that the album would be released around Ramadan Fest, the three-day celebration after the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan. It was rumoured that the first single would be called Biraz Nezaket (A Little Courtesy), written by Sezen Aksu. Tarkan denied this in an interview given at the Atatürk International Airport in Istanbul, declaring that release was delayed and the Sezen Aksu song was taken off the track list.|$|E
