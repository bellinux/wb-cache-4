5000|$|<b>Small</b> <b>pondweed</b> is {{a common}} name for several plants and may refer to: ...|$|E
50|$|In Britain, <b>small</b> <b>pondweed</b> {{is common}} and widespread. It is {{probably}} under-recorded {{due to its}} relatively small size and confusion with P. pusillus.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Small</b> <b>pondweed</b> {{was first}} {{named by the}} German {{botanist}} Franz Xaver Fieber in 1838. [...] It is named after the 19th century Czech botanist Friedrich von Berchtold.|$|E
5000|$|Potamogeton pusillus is {{a species}} of aquatic plant known by the common names <b>small</b> <b>{{pondweed}},</b> [...] lesser pondweed or least pondweed. It occurs in standing and slow-flowing freshwater habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere.|$|E
50|$|<b>Small</b> <b>pondweed</b> {{is similar}} to several other Potamogeton species, {{especially}} P. pusillus, and use of a good key such as Preston (1995) is strongly recommended. It could also be confused with P. trichoides and P. obtusifolius.|$|E
50|$|<b>Small</b> <b>pondweed</b> {{is not in}} cultivation, {{though it}} is likely to spontaneously {{colonise}} new ponds, probably via waterfowl. It is unlikely to persist for long in this environment, however, unless competing plants are regularly cleared. Its small stature and noninvasive habit make it suitable for growing in a pond or aquarium.|$|E
50|$|Other {{plant species}} which are {{otherwise}} scarce or absent in the Bristol region but found in high concentrations on the North Somerset Levels are: Flowering-rush (Myles, p. 210), Lesser Water-plantain (Myles, p.210-1), Frogbit (Myles, p. 210-1), Lesser Pondweed (Myles, p.212-3), <b>Small</b> <b>Pondweed</b> (Myles, p. 212-3), Hairlike Pondweed (Myles, p213), Opposite-leaved Pondweed (Myles, p.213) and Horned Pondweed (Myles, p.213).|$|E
50|$|Although it {{does not}} occur in very acid environments, <b>small</b> <b>pondweed</b> is {{otherwise}} tolerant {{of a wide range}} of water chemistry and seems able to survive in eutrophic conditions. However, it is less tolerant of high nutrient levels than the related and very similar P. pusillus. It is the only British fine-leaved pondweed likely to be encountered in oligotrophic lakes, where it generally grows in deeper water with Isoetes and Nitella spp.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Small</b> <b>pondweed</b> is a fine-leaved pondweeds with a bushy habit. It lacks a {{perennial}} rhizome {{and the plants}} die back in winter into {{a large number of}} resting buds known as turions. The stems are very slender and do not usually exceed 60 cm. The leaves are flat, usually 25-50 mm long, and less than 2 mm wide, usually with a broad band of lacunae along each side of the midrib and coloured pale green, olive green or brownish green. [...] The open stipules and shining nodal glands can be important characters in identification.|$|E
