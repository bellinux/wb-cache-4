5|$|As the Philadelphia Council's newly hired field {{executive}} in 1915, one of Goodman's assignments was {{to serve as}} director of the council's summer camp at Treasure Island Scout Reservation on the Delaware River. He believed that the summer camp experience <b>should</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> than just teach proficiency in Scoutcraft skills; rather, the principles embodied in the Scout Oath and Scout Law should become realities in the lives of Scouts. Along with his assistant camp director, Carroll A. Edson, he started an experimental program to recognize those Scouts best exemplifying those traits as an example to their peers.|$|E
5|$|Bart {{attempts}} to reinspire Krusty by showing him old episodes of the show, but {{he picks up}} on the repetitive nature of his own jokes, and binge drinks in anger. He passes out and has a vision of himself in Jewish Heaven, where he meets Rodney Dangerfield. Rabbi Krustofski then appears and tells Krusty that Jews {{do not believe in}} Heaven, and thus he <b>should</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> to help others. An act of kindness does not seem to make him happier, but Bart takes Krusty to the synagogue, where Rabbi Krustofski's favorite Rabbi recites Krusty's jokes on religion. Krusty therefore deduces that his father did find him funny, and sees him again in Jewish Heaven, where Jesus turns Dangerfield's water into a Bloody Mary.|$|E
5|$|The fourth Test, {{in front}} of Hutton's home crowd, was his least {{successful}} of the series. He was bowled second ball by a yorker from Lindwall and England struggled to remain competitive throughout the match. In the fourth innings of the game, Australia needed 177 runs to win, with 115 minutes of play remaining. Hutton used Trevor Bailey to bowl negatively and slow Australia down; his tactics, including time-wasting {{and the use of}} leg theory, meant Australia could not score the runs in the available time and the match was drawn. It is possible that the idea came from Bailey himself, but the Australian press criticised Hutton for his negativity. In contrast, English critics believed the tactics were justified. Amid great public interest for the deciding fifth Test, Hutton lost his fifth successive toss but replying to Australia's first innings of 275, England established a narrow first-innings lead. Surviving an early scare when a bouncer from Lindwall nearly knocked his cap onto his wickets, Hutton scored 82. In reply, Australia collapsed before the England spinners and England scored the necessary 132 runs to win their first series against Australia since 1932–33 and their first such home series win since 1926. Wisden praised Hutton's strategy and tactical sense, and he was widely acclaimed in the press, particularly for the good spirit which he and Hassett, the Australian captain, maintained. Hutton scored 443 runs at an average of 55.37 in the Tests, but found it mentally tiring to lead England. Meanwhile, some Yorkshire observers felt he <b>should</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> to improve discipline at the county. In the whole summer, he scored 2,458 runs at an average of 63.02.|$|E

40|$|Media release: A {{majority}} of Victorians think the State Government <b>should</b> be <b>doing</b> <b>more</b> to address alcohol-related harms and want party leaders to outline {{their plans to}} address alcohol-related harms prior to the upcoming election. Victorians are most concerned by the Government’s failure to address alcohol related violence, with 77 per cent saying the Napthine Government <b>should</b> be <b>doing</b> <b>more</b> to prevent alcohol–related street violence, 76 per cent stating the government <b>should</b> be <b>doing</b> <b>more</b> to reduce alcohol-related family and domestic violence and 73 % believe the Government <b>should</b> be <b>doing</b> <b>more</b> to reduce risky alcohol consumption among underage drinkers. The polling conducted by Galaxy Research, {{on behalf of the}} Foundation for Alcohol Research and Education (FARE), also found that three in four Victorian voters (75 %) would like the party leaders to outline their plan to address alcohol-related harms prior to next month’s State election. However, in an apparent vote of no confidence, Victorians don’t seem to think either of the major parties are up to the task. Only 17 per cent of voters believe the Coalition would be best at reducing alcohol-related harms, 16 per cent the Labor Party, and ten per cent the Greens, with the {{majority of}} Victorians (57 %) uncommitted...|$|R

25|$|Analysis of the 99 {{responses}} to the survey show that the library {{is one of the}} last places that transgender people turn for information due to lack up to date health information, or an unwelcoming environment. Library collections meant to support the needs of transgender individuals were generally less comprehensive than those serving their gay and lesbian counterparts. The authors found that librarians <b>should</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> outreach to transgender communities to communicate a message of welcome, and that the internet could be a potentially powerful tool for outreach to these underrepresented populations.|$|E
