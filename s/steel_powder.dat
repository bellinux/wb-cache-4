This paper focuses on the role of coated and uncoated low carbon stainless <b>steel</b> <b>powders,</b> having d 50  =  7. 3  [mu]m, normal particle size distribution and a shape factor of 1 on additive processes used in micromanufacturing, e. g. micro powder injection moulding ([mu]PIM).

The results clearly show that the coated powders assume an "artichoke" morphology, which significantly increases the surface area. This combined with their nanocrystalline character leads to higher flowability than uncoated powders. However, no improvements have been observed concerning the critical powder volume concentration (CPVC) in feedstocks for [mu]PIM processing. In consolidation processes, the debinding temperatures can attain values higher than 500  °C.

40|$|Stainless steels {{have become}} one of the most popular {{materials}} for the metal injection molding (MIM) process. Due to the poor yield of fine particles in powder production, the cost of relatively fine powders was extremely high. With improvements in the powder processing technique, relatively fine stainless steel powders (mean 10 to 15 micrometers) became available during the 1990 ’s, resulting in a concomitant decrease in the powder price and a rapid increase in the stainless <b>steel</b> <b>powder</b> consumption in the MIM industry. This situation has remained stable till date. However, the demand for finer and finer powders remained quite strong. This demand for ultra-fine powders for MIM (mean around 5 micrometer or less) was fueled by increasing interest in the area of micro-MIM components, the demand for full density parts in the medical field, and the general demand for higher performance stainless steel components. Due to the major improvements (high yields of fine powders) that have been made recently in powder production by Atmix, the use of ultra-fine stainless <b>steel</b> <b>powder</b> has now become a distinct reality. This paper discusses the processing and properties of metal injection molded ultra-fine 316 L stainless steel powders.

40|$|Among many {{engineering}} {{advantages in}} concrete, low thermal conductivity {{is an attractive}} property. Concrete has been widely used for nuclear vessels and plant facilities for its excellent radiation shielding. The heat isolation through low thermal conductivity is actually positive for nuclear power plant concrete; however the property may cause adverse effect when fires and melt-down occur in nuclear vessel since cooling down from outer surface is almost impossible due to very low thermal conductivity. If concrete containing atomic reactor has higher thermal conductivity, the explosion risk of conductive may be partially reduced. This paper presents high thermally conductive concrete development. For the work, magnetite with varying replacements of normal aggregates and <b>steel</b> <b>powder</b> of 1. 5 % of volume are considered, and the equivalent thermal conductivity is evaluated. Only when the replacement ratio goes up to 30 %, thermal conductivity increases rapidly to 2. 5 times. Addition of <b>steel</b> <b>powder</b> is evaluated to be effective by 1. 08 ~ 1. 15 times. In order to evaluate the improvement of thermal conductivity, several models like ACI, DEMM, and MEM are studied, and their results are compared with test results.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to address the anoxic oxidation of metallic iron and stainless <b>steel</b> <b>powder</b> by nitrate, nitrite, and anaerobic mixed cultures. In sterile batch reactors, both nitrate and nitrite(10 mg N/L) could chemically oxidize metallic iron, with a concomitant reduction to ammonium. Nitrate or nitrite reduction coupled to metal corrosion was not observed in the case of stainless <b>steel</b> <b>powder.</b> Combination of an anaerobic mixed culture and metallic iron led to (cathodically produced) Hg consumption and a complete nitrate or nitrite reduction (mainly to NH 4 +). This caused a slightly enhanced metal oxidation. In the case of stainless steel, corrosion caused by denitrifying microorganisms was evidenced by data on nitrate/nitrite ions and solubilized iron. Experiments with increasing nitrite concentrations indicated that nitrite in the range of 50 mg of NO 2 - -N/L inhibited the corrosion processes. Moreover, at concentrations above 140 mg NO 2 - -N/L, a significant production of nitric oxide (NO) was detected. Differences between iron and stainless <b>steel</b> <b>powder</b> at low concentrations of nitrate or nitrite are most probably due to differences in kinetics: metallic iron exhibited faster chemical than biological reactions as opposed to stainless steel. It is postulated that the inhibitory effect of higher nitrite concentrations could partly be due to the chemical formation of NO and its toxic effect on the microorganisms acting at the steel surface...|$|E
