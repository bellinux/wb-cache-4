40|$|The {{release of}} {{biological}} agents, including those {{which could be}} used in biowarfare or bioterrorism in large urban areas, has been a concern for governments for nearly three decades. Previous incidents from Sverdlosk and the postal anthrax attack of 2001 have raised questions on the mechanism of spread of Bacillus anthracis spores as an aerosol or contaminant. Prior studies have demonstrated that Bacillus atrophaeus is easily transferred through <b>simulated</b> <b>mail</b> handing, but no reports have demonstrated this ability with Bacillus anthracis spores, which have morphological differences that may affect adhesion properties between spore and formite. In this study, equipment developed to simulate interactions across three generations of envelopes subjected to tumbling and mixing was used to evaluate the potential for cross-contamination of B. anthracis spores in <b>simulated</b> <b>mail</b> handling. In these experiments, we found that the potential for cross-contamination through letter tumbling {{from one generation to the}} next varied between generations while the presence of a fluidizer had no statistical impact on the transfer of material.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedAsterisk, the open-source PBX, supports various implementations of voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), a popular alternative to public switched telephone networks (PSTN) that offers cost benefits {{and ease of}} management. The Monterey Security Architecture (MYSEA) is a distributed multilevel security (MLS) environment designed to provide secure, collaborative sharing of information. It does not currently support either real-time voice communications or voice mail. The purposes of this thesis are to determine high-level VoIP requirements and to build a minimized version of Asterisk that supports these requirements. This minimized version of Asterisk could then be ported to run within the MYSEA architecture. To achieve this goal, threats were enumerated and requirements were determined. Then the modules within Asterisk were minimized to eliminate unnecessary functionality while still supporting mechanisms required for voice communications and voice <b>mail.</b> <b>Testing</b> showed that voice calls could be placed and voice mail messages could be left and retrieved using the minimized Asterisk server. Asterisk's functionality was successfully minimized {{to meet the requirements}} determined through the VoIP analysis by reducing the number of modules used for the build.

Private well water is not regulated to meet the federal drinking water arsenic Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) of 10 /L, or the more protective 5 /L New Jersey (NJ) state MCL. In the absence of consistent private well regulation, public health efforts have relied on promoting testing in affected communities to various degrees of success.

Through our survey of randomly selected addresses (n= 670) in 17 NJ towns we find higher rates of arsenic testing in areas with a history of testing promotion. However, we also see a stronger correlation of testing behavior with income and education in high promotion areas, suggesting that community engagement activities may be exacerbating socioeconomic status (SES) testing disparities.

Meal equivalent (ME) conversions were most commonly defined as: 2 breakfasts = ME; $ 2. 00 = ME; and 3 or 4 after-school snacks = ME. There was little consistency in use of labor productivity standards and ME conversions in Texas school foodservice operations, which limits their validity for external benchmarking.

40|$|Deciding {{who should}} receive a {{mail-order}} catalog {{is among the}} most important decisions that mail-order-catalog firms must address. In practice, the current approach to the problem is invariably myopic: firms send catalogs to customers who they think are most likely to order from that catalog. In doing so, the firms overlook the long-run implications of these decisions. For example, it may be profitable to mail to customers who are unlikely to order immediately if sending the current catalog increases the probability of a future order. We propose a model that allows firms to optimize mailing decisions by addressing the dynamic implications of their decisions. The model is conceptually simple and straightforward to implement. We apply the model to a large sample of historical data provided by a catalog firm and then evaluate its performance in a large-scale field test. The findings offer support for the proposed model but also identify opportunities for further improvement. dynamic optimization, catalog <b>mailing,</b> field <b>test,</b> Markov decision process...|$|R

40|$|This study {{develops}} and validates {{a measure}} for Jones et al. 's (2007) four other-regarding stakeholder cultures of corporate egoist, instrumentalist, moralist and altruist in the not-for-profit (NFP) context. Jones et al. 's (2007, p. l 37) typology of 'stakeholder culture', defined as "the aspects of organizational culture {{consisting of the}} beliefs, values, and practices that have evolved for solving problems and otherwise managing stakeholder relationships", is the most recent development in the organizational ethics literature. Stakeholder culture provides insight into why organizations deal with stakeholders variably and helps predict how organizations make stakeholder-related decisions. Thus, the typology is particularly relevant to not-for-profit organizations (NFPs), which deal {{with an array of}} stakeholders (Costa et al. 2011; Davison 2007; Murtaza 2012). In Australia, the recent establishment of the sector's regulator, the Australian Charities and Not-for-profit Commission (ACNC), resulted in regulatory reforms with enhanced accountability requirements imposed upon NFPs. An appreciation and understanding of NFPs' stakeholder culture will help improve NFPs' accountability to stakeholders. A 33 -item stakeholder culture scale was developed deductively by undertaking an extensive literature review (Dees 1998; Dolnicar et al. 2008; Victor & Cullen 1987; 1988) and consulting academic colleagues and NFP personnel. Following a pre-test, 26 items were retained for <b>testing.</b> <b>Mail</b> survey data were collected from top management of 621 Australian NFPs, representing a 71. 1 % response rate. The sample was divided into two sub-samples for exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). EFA produced a five-factor structure that was overall congruent with Jones et al. 's (2007) classification of the corporate egoist, instrumentalist, moralist and altruist stakeholder cultures. The only departure was that the altruist items were spilt into two factors (i. e., Altruist_client and Altruist_general). CFA examined a four-factor model according to Jones et al. (2007) by combining the sub-factors of the altruist stakeholder culture. Tests and results indicated good model fit, internal consistency, construct validity and predictive validity. The Study has important methodological, theoretical and practical implications. It makes a significant methodological contribution to the literature by developing a scale to measure Jones et al. 's (2007) stakeholder culture for the first time, providing a foundation for future studies to examine the typology. In terms of its theoretical implications, the study shows that Jones et al. 's (2007) proposed moralist stakeholder culture may be interpreted differently in the NFP context, as opposed to the for-profit setting. The study also investigates the relation between top management's values and an organization's stakeholder culture, adding to the literature on the link between personal and organizational characteristics (Hambrick & Mason 1984; Schein 2004). In terms of its practical implications, the stakeholder culture scale can be used by NFP management to resolve ethical issues relating to stakeholders when and where a conflict arises. It will also assist NFPs in fostering a stakeholder culture that will attract and sustain support from important stakeholders. Moreover, the results indicate the predominance of the altruist stakeholder culture in NFPs, which demonstrates that, even in times of regulatory uncertainty and hostile funding competition, NFPs appear to care for their legitimate stakeholders (i. e., clients). Hence, the ACNC, the sector's regulator, may need to consider the altruistic nature ofNFPs in imposing further accountability requirements on the sector. The new reporting and accountability requirements to be introduced should not undermine NFPs' ability to achieve their mission (Laratta 2011). 2 page(s...|$|R
