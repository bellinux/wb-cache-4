A spread is the difference when one <b>sell</b> <b>side</b> firm sells to a client and then goes on to sell the security to another client. Clients on the <b>sell</b> <b>side</b> can be high-net-worth individuals or institutions that include retirement funds for cities or states, as well as mutual funds. <b>Sell</b> <b>side</b> firms employ research analysts, traders and salespeople who collectively strive to generate ideas and execute trades for buy side firms, enticing them to do business.|$|E

Part of the {{research}} analyst's job includes publishing research reports on public companies, these reports analyze their business and provide recommendations on the purchase or sale of the stock.Many times research analysts on the <b>sell</b> <b>side</b> cover an entire fund with a specific purpose or devoted to a specific sector. Sometimes a different approach is taken where by multiple committees are in charge of different parts of the investment making process. <b>Sell</b> <b>side</b> analysts generally get their information for their reports {{from a variety of sources}} including public and private sources. The research reports ultimately published contain earnings forecasts, future prospects and recommendations as previously mentioned. [...] In addition to the aforementioned, <b>sell</b> <b>side</b> analysts have the responsibility to take time and develop relationships with their clients as well as the companies they are researching. There has been research into the relationship between the quality of the research and the amount of capital that the firm collectively raises for its many clients. Many research analysts focus on one particular sector or industry such as telecom, technology, healthcare, among many others. <b>Sell</b> <b>side</b> analysts are responsible for creating a pitch, usually in the form of a book, that are then presented to prospective clients usually for new stock.|$|E

So far, however, no {{research has}} addressed this issue at the agent level. The question this research seeks to answer is whether specialization in one side of the real estate transaction increases agent income. The most important finding is that specialization has an asymmetric impact on earnings. Specializing in listings positively enhances agent income. In contrast, specialization on the <b>selling</b> <b>side</b> has an adverse affect on agent income.

40|$|We generalise the {{description}} of the dynamics of the order book of financial markets in terms of a Brownian particle embedded in a fluid of incoming, exiting and annihilating particles by presenting a model of the velocity on each <b>side</b> (buy and <b>sell)</b> independently. The improved model builds on the time-averaged number of particles in the inner layer and its change per unit time, where the inner layer is revealed by the correlations between price velocity and change in the number of particles (limit orders). This allows us to introduce the Knudsen number of the financial Brownian particle motion and its asymmetric version (on the buy and <b>sell</b> <b>sides).</b> Not being considered previously, the asymmetric Knudsen numbers are crucial in finance in order to detect asymmetric price changes. The Knudsen numbers allows us to characterise the conditions for the market dynamics to be correctly described by a continuous stochastic process. Not questioned until now for large liquid markets such as the USD/JPY and EUR/USD exchange rates, we show that there are regimes when the Knudsen numbers are so high that discrete particle effects dominate, such as during market stresses and crashes. We document the presence of imbalances of particles depletion rates on the buy and <b>sell</b> <b>sides</b> that are associated with high Knudsen numbers and violent directional price changes. This indicator can detect the direction of the price motion at the early stage while the usual volatility risk measure is blind to the price direction...|$|R
40|$|Complex {{interactions}} between fundamentals and liquidity during unstable periods in financial markets are succinctly modeled with coordination games. We propose a flexible framework to estimate {{such a model}} and use the efficient method of moments as estimation procedure.

The model fits the data well, with evidence of low information disparities, the market is generally very deep, where global volatility {{is more important than}} fundamental uncertainty in the determination of liquidity.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{examines}} the accruals anomaly in an agency context where managers of overvalued firms have incentives to sustain overvaluation. We hypothesize that mangers anticipate the ultimate share price reversals and use high accruals to temporarily sustain overvaluation, {{while at the}} same time sell their shares. There is no incentive to deflate earnings of undervalued firms, leading to the prediction of an asymmetric relationship between trading and accruals. Our results support an agency explanation. Quadratic and binary regressions confirm that relationship between trades and accruals is concentrated on the <b>selling</b> <b>side.</b> The relationship between accruals and trading is only significant within the overvalued, low book-to-market (BM) firms. There is also evidence that low BM firms manage their earnings upward compared to high BM firm...|$|R
5000|$|After the {{bursting}} of {{the dot-com}} bubble, many US <b>sell</b> <b>side</b> firms {{were accused of}} self-dealing in a lawsuit brought by New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer. In addition to the business done with buy side firms as described above, <b>sell</b> <b>side</b> firms also performed investment banking services for corporations, such as stock and debt offerings, loans, etc.The New York Attorney General formally brought these charges against several Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts. These corporate clients generally {{did not like to}} see negative press put out about their own companies. To try to prevent the publishing of negative research, corporate clients would pressure the <b>sell</b> <b>side</b> firms by threatening to withhold lucrative banking business or demanding equally lucrative shares in IPOs - essentially bribing the <b>sell</b> <b>side</b> firm. While the $1.4 billion settlement of this lawsuit made significant progress in cleaning up the industry in the US, it's notable that the lawsuit only went after <b>sell</b> <b>side</b> firms, leaving the arguably equally culpable corporations relatively unscathed.The past few years the role of a research analyst has changed. After the dot-com bubble, more research has been completed to see the actual roles and duties of a research analyst to get a better idea behind their decision making process. Other provisions such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (2002) and other regulations were enacted by the Securities and Exchange Commission in response to public outcry following the legal concerns [...] The Sarbanes- Oxley Act (2002) limits the relationship between investment banking and research analysts and prohibits promises of favorable research as well as restricting and inciting pre-clearance requirements for traders personal trading.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The paper {{examines}} {{the changes in}} the price impact of trades in the major Korean stock market following the introduction of disclosure to all traders of the top five brokers on the buy-side and the top five brokers on the sell-side of trades in real time for each stock in the KOSDAQ market. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses several alternative metrics for the price impact of trades. The study applies estimation methodology that accounts for the potential endogeneity of other market quality proxies, which are used as control variables in price impact regressions, by utilizing two-stage-least-square methods with fixed effect specification. Findings: This study finds that the permanent price impact (information effect) of both buyer- and seller-initiated trades increases, which indicates that information is disseminated quicker in a transparent market. Uninformed trades have a larger permanent price impact than informed trades on both the buy and <b>sell</b> <b>sides.</b> The liquidity price effects are found to be mixed for buys and sells. Research implications: The study supports the current policy of the Korean Exchange to publicly display the five most active broker IDs on both the buy and <b>sell</b> <b>sides,</b> as it attracts both informed and liquidity traders, leading to faster price discovery in a more transparent market. However, a future study which analyzes the change in the market quality in both local markets would provide a complete picture {{of the effects of the}} policy. Originality/value: Earlier studies documenting the effect of broker ID disclosure on market quality used effective spreads, market depth or order book imbalance as market quality measures. This study contributes to the existing literature by examining the changes in direct measures of the private information effect and liquidity effect of trades in a stock market – the Korean Stock Exchange – when the other part of the exchange (the KOSDAQ stock market) shifts to public broker ID transparency at the same transparency level.
