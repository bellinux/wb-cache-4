5|$|Before the First World War, {{having seen}} the cavalry feats of mounted Boers during the Second Boer War, Britain {{increased}} its cavalry reserves. Smaller Cleveland Bays were used to carry British troopers, and larger members of the breed pulled artillery; the British War Office offered premiums on Cleveland Bay stallions. Although the First World War was not the cavalry war the British expected, large numbers of horses were used to pull artillery and losses were high. Because the war caused a depletion in stock, in 1920 and 1921, the British society opened a <b>special</b> <b>register</b> for previously unregistered mares of Cleveland Bay type, including some already registered with the Yorkshire Coach Horse (a Cleveland/Thoroughbred cross) registry, after they had passed an inspection that certified them to be of proper breed type. The subsequent foals of these mares were eligible for registration into the main British Cleveland Bay stud book, and were also eligible to compete in competitions reserved for breed members. Some of this progeny was bred and owned by King George V.|$|E

5000|$|Because <b>special</b> <b>registers</b> {{are closely}} tied to some special {{function}} or status of the processor, {{they might not be}} directly writeable by normal instructions (such as adds, moves, etc.). Instead, some <b>special</b> <b>registers</b> in some processor architectures require special instructions to modify them. For example, the program counter is not directly writeable in many processor architectures. Instead, the programmer uses instructions such as return from subroutine, jump, or branch to modify the program counter. For another example, the condition code register might not directly writable, instead being updated only by compare instructions.|$|R
25|$|Though foreign {{residents}} cannot vote {{in national}} elections (president and vice–president and national legislators), they can vote in provinces which have legislation to allow foreigners {{to vote in}} provincial/municipal elections. To exercise this right it is a preliminary requirement to know the corresponding provincial legislation. Nevertheless, in all cases it is mandatory to have the National Identity Card (D.N.I) and to be enrolled in a <b>special</b> <b>register</b> set up for that purpose.|$|E

Having shown that the data support the assumption that the unrealised object is syntactically active, I propose a novel analysis of missing objects in <b>special</b> <b>registers,</b> guided by recent developments in the generative linguistic theory. Null realisation of the object is considered as an issue of externalisation and intralinguistic variation is attributed to the rules operating at the SM interface which make it possible to extend the application of copy deletion, as assumed within the copy theory of movement...|$|R
