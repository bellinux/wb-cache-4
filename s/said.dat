5|$|Denise Wong, the Calgarian {{actor who}} portrayed Number 18 in the premiere, <b>said</b> that {{the play was}} about the human condition. Evelyn Chew, the Vancouverite actor {{who took over the}} role for the 2012 tour, <b>said</b> that the play is intense because it unabashedly deals with human trafficking, and that builds in {{intensity}} to its climax. Sienna Howell-Holden, who played Mama in the premiere and the 2012 tour, <b>said</b> that many audience members had not been previously familiar with 21st-century human trafficking. The character of Mama calls {{attention to the fact that}} poverty in the Third World fuels sex trafficking. Stephen Waldschmidt <b>said</b> he hoped that the play will educate Canadians about human trafficking and motivate them to act on what they learn, thereby turning them into anti-sexual slavery activists. He also <b>said</b> he hoped that the play will put a face on the million women and children sold into sexual slavery each year worldwide. Because of the play's heavy themes, producers of the first performances issued an advisory for parents. Waldschmidt also stressed the amount of action in the play and <b>said</b> that, if the play was a film, it would receive a PG-13 rating and would be billed a thriller. He also <b>said</b> it was difficult to stage a play that is inherently sexual and extremely violent in nature without making it feel pornographic. Waldschmidt <b>said</b> that he wanted to stage She Has a Name partially to show how horrible human trafficking is and partially because the play is so theatrically gripping.|$|E
5|$|Edward Wadie <b>Said</b> {{was born}} on 1 November 1935, to Hilda <b>Said</b> and Wadie <b>Said,</b> a {{businessman}} in Jerusalem, then part of British-governed Mandatory Palestine (1920–48). Wadie <b>Said</b> was a Palestinian man who soldiered in the U.S. Army component of the American Expeditionary Forces (1917–19), commanded by General John J. Pershing, in the First World War (1914–18). Afterwards, that war-time military service earned American citizenship to <b>Said</b> père and his family. Edward’s mother, Hilda <b>Said</b> was born Lebanese and raised in Nazareth, Palestine.|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{wanted to}} {{describe}} the characteristics, treatment and outcome of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases (<b>SAIDs)</b> associated with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), and conducted a French multicenter retrospective study and a literature review. We included 26 cases of CMML (median age 75 years, 54 % female), 80 % with CMML- 1. CPSS score was low (0 or 1) in 75 % of cases. SAIDS was systemic vasculitis in 54 %. Diagnosis of the 2 diseases was concomitant in 31 % cases, and CMML was diagnosed before <b>SAIDs</b> in 12 cases (46 %). First line treatment for <b>SAIDs</b> consisted mostly of steroid, with 85 % of response. Second-line treatment was needed in 40 % cases. Six patients received hypomethylating agents, with 66 % response on <b>SAIDs.</b> A literature review found 49 cases of CMML-associated <b>SAIDs,</b> in whom <b>SAIDs</b> was systemic vasculitis in 29 % cases. Hence, vasculitis is the most frequent <b>SAIDs</b> associated with CMML. After initial response to steroids, recurrence and steroid-dependence were frequent. Hypomethylating agents may be interesting in this context. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

5|$|IGN <b>said</b> {{that the}} {{difference}} between character classes such as Thief and Jew were disappointingly minimal, offering little variety or incentive to replay as another class. IGN also <b>said</b> some missions and side quests were tedious, and were elevated by their setting rather than their quality, while the reviewer thought the environmental puzzles were a clever option for avoiding combat and were rare enough to be enjoyable when available. However, GameSpot <b>said</b> the puzzles felt scripted and simple. Reviewers <b>said</b> that many of the gameplay functions and controls were poorly explained, making them difficult to activate; others were critical of excessive loading times upon entering new locations and slow menus such as the Facebook panel.|$|E
5|$|In 1698, Zanzibar {{became part}} of the {{overseas}} holdings of Oman, falling {{under the control of the}} Sultan of Oman. In 1832, or 1840 (the date varies among sources), <b>Said</b> bin Sultan moved his capital from Muscat in Oman to Stone Town. He established a ruling Arab elite and encouraged the development of clove plantations, using the island's slave labour. Zanzibar's commerce fell increasingly into the hands of traders from the Indian subcontinent, whom <b>Said</b> encouraged to settle on the island. After his death in 1856, two of his sons, Majid bin <b>Said</b> and Thuwaini bin <b>Said,</b> struggled over the succession, so Zanzibar and Oman were divided into two separate principalities; Thuwaini became the Sultan of Oman while Majid became the first Sultan of Zanzibar. During his 14-year reign as Sultan, Majid consolidated his power around the East African slave trade. His successor, Barghash bin <b>Said,</b> helped abolish the slave trade in Zanzibar and largely developed the country's infrastructure. The third Sultan, Khalifa bin <b>Said,</b> also furthered the country's progress toward abolishing slavery.|$|E
