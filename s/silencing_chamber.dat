50|$|Once {{open to the}} {{elements}} the building deteriorated further. At 6pm on Wednesday 17 February 1836 heavy gales brought down {{the north side of}} the ruin sending a quake like tremor through the town. The remaining east belfry wall was later dismantled to a reduced height. One large <b>silence</b> <b>chamber</b> window with its distinctive reticulated tracery remains in situ.|$|R
60|$|Then {{the sword}} fell from Abi's hand, {{and there was}} <b>silence</b> in that <b>chamber.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Long after I {{had gone}} to bed a sudden <b>silence</b> filled the <b>chamber,</b> and I knew that David had awaked. I lay motionless, and, after what seemed a long time of waiting, a little far-away voice said in a {{cautious}} whisper, [...] "Irene!" ...|$|R
60|$|Instantly I sprang {{toward it}} to wrench it open again, for {{something}} in the uncanny movement of the thing and the tense and almost palpable <b>silence</b> of the <b>chamber</b> seemed to portend a lurking evil lying hidden in this rock-bound chamber within {{the bowels of the}} Golden Cliffs.|$|R
5000|$|Mauna (Sanskrit: मौनम्) or Maunitva (मौनित्व) means - silence, taciturnity, {{silence of}} the mind - as in मौनमुद्रा (the {{attitude}} of silence) and मौनव्रतम् (a vow of silence) or मौनिन् (observing vow of silence). A Sanskrit Dictionary gives many words such as - अनिर्वचनम् (silence, not uttering anything), अभाषणम् (silence, not speaking), अवचन (absence of assertion, silence, taciturnity), अव्याहृतम् (silence), निःशब्दम् (silence, a calm), - as referring to <b>silence.</b> [...] <b>Chambers</b> Twentieth Century Dictionary gives {{the meaning of the}} word, Silence, as absence of sound; abstention from sounding, speech, mention, or communication; a time of such absence or abstention, taciturnity.|$|R
60|$|Of course {{restitution}} {{was out of}} the question; {{and even}} Johnny felt that any merely temporal punishment would be weakly inadequate to the demands of justice. But that night, in the dead <b>silence</b> of his <b>chamber,</b> Johnny registered a great and solemn swear that so soon as he could worry together a little capital, he would fling his feeble remaining energies into the spendthrift business. And he did so.|$|R
60|$|And Caroline also walked silently {{down the}} hill. She {{knew that she}} had given an {{ambiguous}} answer, and was content to let it remain so. In the <b>silence</b> of her <b>chamber,</b> she would think over this thing and make her calculations. She would inquire into her own mind, and learn whether she could afford to love this man whom she could not but acknowledge to be so loveable. As for asking any one else, seeking counsel in the matter from her aunt, that never for a moment suggested itself to Caroline Waddington.|$|R

5000|$|On 14 July 1953, Balfour {{finally broke}} eight years' <b>silence</b> in the <b>chamber</b> {{to make his}} maiden speech in a debate on {{industry}} in Scotland. As he began speaking, {{he explained that he}} had tried to get in to speak in other debates but found it so difficult that it was hardly worthwhile. He then observed [...] "People get up here {{from time to time and}} keep us here for hours on end, and I have said 'What's the use of inflicting another torture upon the House?'" [...] In the main body of his speech he opposed the policy of building new towns when old towns, including those in his constituency, were becoming derelict.|$|R
5|$|The post of a Whip {{normally}} required <b>silence</b> in the <b>chamber</b> of the House of Commons, but in February 1976 Dormand {{was involved}} in a difficult situation which required him to give an explanation. The Conservative opposition had called a vote censuring the Secretary of State for Industry Eric Varley by reducing his salary to £1,000. Dormand was appointed as one of the tellers to count the vote, but both he and his Conservative opposite number miscounted and lost the true count. When Mellish announced the confusion to the Speaker, the Speaker agreed to hold another vote. Embarrassingly for Dormand, many Labour MPs had not stayed to hear the result and were no longer present, resulting in the Conservatives winning the vote by a majority of five. The Government decided that the result was not a true indication of the House's opinion and overturned the vote a few days later.|$|R
60|$|In the evening, Adrian and I {{proceeded}} to Westminster. As we went {{he reminded me}} of what I was to say and do, yet, strange to say, I entered the chamber without having once reflected on my purpose. Adrian remained in the coffee-room, while I, in compliance with his desire, took my seat in St. Stephen's. There reigned unusual <b>silence</b> in the <b>chamber.</b> I had not visited it since Raymond's protectorate; a period conspicuous for a numerous attendance of members, for the eloquence of the speakers, and the warmth of the debate. The benches were very empty, those by custom occupied by the hereditary members were vacant; the city members were there--the members for the commercial towns, few landed proprietors, and not many of those who entered parliament {{for the sake of a}} career. The first subject that occupied the attention of the house was an address from the Lord Protector, praying them to appoint a deputy during a necessary absence on his part.|$|R
40|$|Eternal Father, in {{this moment}} of prayer, when there is <b>silence</b> in this <b>Chamber,</b> may there not be silence in Your presence. May our prayers be heard. May no short {{circuits}} be made by our lack of faith, our high professions jointed to low attainment, our fine words hiding shabby thoughts or friendly faces masking cold hearts. Out of the same old needs, conscious of the same old faults, we pray on the same old terms for new mercies and new blessings. We pray to the One who has always given us assurance that You will hear and answer our prayers. AMEN. Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag. Senator Horsford moved that further reading of the Journal be dispensed with, and the President and Secretary be authorized {{to make the necessary}} corrections and additions. Motion carried. Mr. President announced that if there were no objections, the Senate would recess subject to the call of the Chair. Senate in recess at 11 : 26 a. m...|$|R
6000|$|Another {{cause of}} the mild kind of {{happiness}} I now experienced was the consciousness {{of a change in}} my own mental disposition, which made me less of an alien in the house; for I was now able, I imagined, to appreciate the beautiful character of my friends, their crystal purity of heart and the religion they professed. Far {{back in the old days}} I had heard, first and last, a great deal about sweetness and light and Philistines, and not quite knowing what this grand question was all about, and hearing from some of my friends that I was without the qualities they valued most, I thereafter proclaimed myself a Philistine, and was satisfied to have the controversy ended in that way, so far as it concerned me personally. Now, however, I was like one to whom some important thing has been told, who, scarcely hearing and straightway forgetting, goes about his affairs; but, lying awake at night in the <b>silence</b> of his <b>chamber,</b> recalls the unheeded words and perceives their full significance. My sojourn with this people--angelic women and mild-eyed men with downy, unrazored lips, so mild in manner yet in their arts [...] "laying broad bases for eternity"--above all the invalid hours spent daily in the Mother's Room, had taught me how unlovely a creature I had been. It would have been strange indeed if, in such an atmosphere, I had not absorbed a little sweetness and light into my system.|$|R
60|$|And {{the upshot}} {{of all this is}} that the Squire was not {{altogether}} wrong when he declared in the <b>silence</b> of /his/ <b>chamber</b> that Edward Cossey was not quite a gentleman. He showed it when he allowed himself to be guided by the arts of Mr. Quest into the adoption of the idea of obtaining a lien upon Ida, to be enforced if convenient. He showed it again, and what is more he committed a huge mistake, when tempted thereto by the opportunity of the moment, he made a conditional bargain with the said Ida, whereby she was placed in pledge for a sum of thirty thousand pounds, well knowing that her honour would be equal to the test, and that if convenient to him she would be ready to pay the debt. He made a huge mistake, for had he been quite a gentleman, he would have known that he could not have adopted a worse road to the affections of a lady. Had he been content to advance the money and then by-and-bye, though even {{that would not have been}} gentlemanlike, have gently let transpire what he had done at great personal expense and inconvenience, her imagination might have been touched and her gratitude would certainly have been excited. But the idea of bargaining, the idea of purchase, which after what had passed could never be put aside, would of necessity be fatal to any hope of tender feeling. Shylock might get his bond, but of his own act he had debarred himself from the possibility of ever getting more.|$|R
60|$|Week after week, {{month after}} month elapsed, without making any change in my circumstances. The vital flame, which had seemed nearly extinct when first I met my father, kept {{fluttering}} on without any apparent diminution. I watched him constantly, faithfully--I had almost said patiently. I knew that his death alone would set me free; yet I never at any moment wished it. I felt too glad {{to be able to}} make any atonement for past disobedience; and, denied as I had been all endearments of relationship in my early days, my heart yearned towards a father, who, in his age and helplessness, had thrown himself entirely on me for comfort. My passion for Bianca gained daily more force from absence; by constant meditation it wore itself a deeper and deeper channel. I made no new friends nor acquaintances; sought none of the pleasures of Naples which my rank and fortune threw open to me. Mine was a heart that confined itself to few objects, but dwelt upon those with the intenser passion. To sit by my father, and administer to his wants, and to meditate on Bianca in the <b>silence</b> of his <b>chamber,</b> was my constant habit. Sometimes I amused myself with my pencil in portraying the image that was ever present to my imagination. I transferred to canvas every look and smile of hers that dwelt in my heart. I showed them to my father in hopes of awakening an interest in his bosom for the mere shadow of my love; but he was too far sunk in intellect to take any more than a child-like notice of them.|$|R
5000|$|A {{description}} of the Golovins’ {{way of life in}} the house on the Moyka (from V. A. Zhukovskaya’s notes about G. Rasputin): “It was in 1914, soon after I had made the acquaintance of R. (Rasputin), when I came to them on Munya’s invitation. It was an old dark house with entresols on the Mojka. The house had inner oak staircases laid over with thick carpets, a silent boy servant in a big cool anteroom, a white living-room with Venetian mirrors and lacquered furniture, a silk boudoir with a monster dog of bulldog breed sleeping in the corner of a low quilted sofa. There was also a marvelous old portrait by Levitsky in a carved frame, cracked chinaware and eerie <b>silence</b> of forsaken <b>chambers,</b> occasionally sharply broken by telephone ring. When I made acquaintance of them the father had already died, and the three women were living there: Lub. Val. with her daughters. The elder daughter - Olga Evgenjevna - was a hospital nurse and seldom came home. The grandmother - Olga Vasiljevna Karnovich - was nicknamed “an eagle” by R. She lived separately and came {{from time to time in}} her silk two-seater carriage drawn by two dark bay horses; more often the family came to visit her. She treated R. with disapproval - as she told me herself - but tenderly loving Munya, she concealed her animosity and sometimes even acknowledged meekly, that “it is not for us to judge” and asked R. to pray. The whole way of life in the house was nearly cloistral: strictly established time of dinner and breakfast, resigned respectfulness of Lub. Val. to her mother and of her daughters to herself. Orders were given in a low voice, nearly in whisper, servants slid silently. There were icon-lamps in front of sacred images, subtle smell of hothouse flowers, candles, old fabric, perfume and frankincense losing their fragrance - the smell like the one in Father Superiors’ monastic cells and manor houses, where one and the same people have lived for a long time. And along with it, there was R.’s unbridled liberty, his rollicking words and dancing mania, and Munya’s belief in his holiness, and Lub. Val.’s sincere commitment to him. And at the same time there was Lokhtina’s wild shouting: «Prostrate yourselves in adoration! The god himself has descended on the Earth!» - her hysterical tricks and absurd clothes with waving ribbons…” ...|$|R
