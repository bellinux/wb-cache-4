5|$|Meanwhile, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Jim Halpert's (John Krasinski) pranking {{has caused}} Cathy Simms (Lindsey Broad) to ask Andy {{to move her}} to a {{different}} desk. In turn, Andy orders Dwight and Jim to quit their childish behavior. He tells them that the next one to pull a prank will lose their Christmas bonus, and {{the target of the}} prank will get the prankster's share. Wanting to double their bonuses, both Dwight and Jim attempt to frame the other. Jim loudly releases his credit card information hoping Dwight will steal it and buy something ridiculous. However, Dwight orders a $200 bouquet of flowers for Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer). Dwight then puts a porcupine in his desk and blames Jim. However, a verbal slip-up causes him to inadvertently reveal his intentions. Jim, in retaliation, defaces a picture of his daughter CeCe, and blames Dwight. After Andy <b>says</b> <b>such</b> vandalism is grounds for termination, Jim admits he staged the crime. Acknowledging that his plan has backfired, Andy tells Jim that he will not touch their bonuses, and just wants their behavior to not interfere with their job performances. Jim assures him he will tell Dwight, but purposefully neglects to do so. Dwight thus continues to pull pranks on himself, to Jim's amusement.|$|E

But {{the location of}} the plant, 14 kilometres from the Sundarbans, violates one of the basic preconditions which <b>says</b> <b>such</b> projects must be outside a 25-kilometer radius from the outer periphery of an ecologically sensitive area.|$|E
25|$|Older {{cases had}} held {{that if a}} {{contract}} had already been performed, or a misrepresentation had become a term of the contract, this would preclude rescission. This inflexible position was amended by the Misrepresentation Act 1967 s 1, which simply <b>says</b> <b>such</b> bars no longer exist. However, it must still be remembered that one cannot ask both for rescission and for recovery of expectation damages for breach of contract.|$|E

And yet the chief characters did exist, and the incidents did happen.|$|R

500|$|CJ DeLuzio Chasin {{states in}} Reconsidering Asexuality and Its Radical Potential that {{academic}} research on asexuality [...] "has positioned asexuality {{in line with}} essentialist discourses of sexual orientation" [...] which is troublesome as it creates a binary between asexuals and persons who {{have been subjected to}} psychiatric intervention for disorders such as Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder. Chasin says that this binary implies that all asexuals experience a lifelong (hence, enduring) lack of sexual attraction, that all non-asexuals who experience a lack of sexual desire experience distress over it, and that it pathologizes asexuals who do experience such distress. As Chasin <b>says</b> <b>such</b> diagnoses as HSDD act to medicalize and govern women's sexuality, the article aims to [...] "unpack" [...] problematic definitions of asexuality that are harmful to both asexuals and women alike. Chasin states that asexuality has the power to challenge commonplace discourse of the naturalness of sexuality, but that the unquestioned acceptance of its current definition does not allow for this. Chasin also argues there and elsewhere in Making Sense in and of the Asexual Community: Navigating Relationships and Identities in a Context of Resistance that is important to interrogate why someone might be distressed about low sexual desire. Chasin further argues that clinicians have an ethical obligation to avoid treating low sexual desire per se as pathological, and to discuss asexuality as a viable possibility (where relevant) with clients presenting clinically with low sexual desire.|$|E
2500|$|Tiffin University {{psychologist}} Jonathan Appel, who co-authoured a 2007 {{paper in}} the International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction on the rising popularity of salvia, expressed reluctance to draw any firm conclusions about Brett Chidester's death. [...] "I wouldn’t feel comfortable saying it caused him to commit suicide," [...] he <b>says.</b> <b>Such</b> explanations are, [...] "a {{way to try to}} make sense of something that's pretty senseless. We're always looking for rationalizations and reasons, particularly when there aren't any." ...|$|E

On April 10, 1862, as the United States Marshal for Southern California, Henry D. Barrows, wrote to the commander of Union Army Department of the Pacific in San Francisco, complaining of anti-Union sentiment in Southern California. The letter <b>says</b> <b>such</b> sentiment [...] "permeates society here among both the high and the low," [...] and reports: ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Platonism" [...] {{is a term}} {{coined by}} {{scholars}} {{to refer to the}} intellectual consequences of denying, as Plato's Socrates often does, the reality of the material world. In several dialogues, most notably the Republic, Socrates inverts the common man's intuition about what is knowable and what is real. While most people take the objects of their senses to be real if anything is, Socrates is contemptuous of people who think that something has to be graspable in the hands to be real. In the Theaetetus, he <b>says</b> <b>such</b> people are eu amousoi (εὖ ἄμουσοι), an expression that means literally, [...] "happily without the muses" [...] (Theaetetus 156a). In other words, such people live without the divine inspiration that gives him, and people like him, access to higher insights about reality.|$|E
2500|$|On 20 November 2012, Creasy {{demanded an}} apology {{from the company}} after The Guardian {{reported}} that abusive tweets were sent to her by Wonga employees. Further investigation of the Creasy case showed that computers registered to Wonga.com's London office were used to abuse Creasy over Twitter, and delete criticism, {{as well as the}} reference to [...] "usury" [...] from the English Wikipedia's Wonga.com page. Wonga.com admitted that a [...] "junior employee" [...] may have sent the tweets and defended what it regards as its right to correct [...] "inaccurate" [...] Wikipedia articles, though Wikipedia policy on conflict of interest <b>says</b> <b>such</b> edits are [...] "strongly discouraged." [...] Wonga.com later apologised to Creasy and condemned the Twitter comments, saying they were posted without the knowledge of the company and disciplinary action would be taken.|$|E
2500|$|Bennett {{suggests}} that if Christians and Muslims accept that their formulations {{about the nature of}} God are wholly true but do not express the whole truth about God, they might both say something important about God. [...] "Paradox", he <b>says,</b> <b>such</b> as that God is One but also a Trinity, [...] "could be … essential to the nature of God, who is at one and the same time transcendent and immanent, just and merciful, simple yet complex, singular yet possessing plural attributes, distinct from creation yet intimately involved in, and even present within, creation." [...] Thus, God might speak differently though different religions not [...] "because God is playing a game or authoring confusion but to remind us that we cannot, while remaining human, grasp the totality of who God is." [...] Bennett refers to what he calls his [...] "flirtation with Unitarianism" [...] although states that [...] "over the years" [...] his [...] "faith has become firmly Trinitarian." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sacrifices were ritualistic and {{symbolic}} acts accompanying huge feasts and festivals, and were {{a way to}} properly honor the gods. Victims usually died in the [...] "center stage" [...] amid the splendor of dancing troupes, percussion orchestras, elaborate costumes and decorations, carpets of flowers, crowds of thousands of commoners, and all the assembled elite. Aztec texts frequently refer to human sacrifice as neteotoquiliztli, “the desire {{to be regarded as}} a god”. These members of the society became an ixiptla—that is, a god's representative, image or idol.For each festival, {{at least one of the}} victims took on the paraphernalia, habits, and attributes of the god or goddess whom they were dying to honor or appease. Through this performance, it was said that the divinity had been given 'human form'—that the god now had an ixitli (face). [...] Duran <b>says</b> <b>such</b> victims were 'worshipped... as the deity' or 'as though they had been gods'. Even whilst still alive, ixiptla victims were honored, hallowed and addressed very highly. Particularly the young man who was indoctrinated for a year to submit himself to Tezcatlipoca's temple was the Aztec equivalent of a celebrity, being greatly revered and adored.|$|E
