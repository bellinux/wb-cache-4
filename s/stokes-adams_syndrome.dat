Stokes' sign is a severe throbbing in the abdomen, {{at the right}} of the umbilicus, in acute enteritis. Stokes law is that a muscle situated above an inflamed membrane is often affected with paralysis.|$|E
50|$|In early July, {{the couple}} sailed for Cape Coast, where they arrived on 16 August. Two months later, on 15 October, Landon was found dead, {{a bottle of}} prussic acid in her hand. However, that she was {{poisoned}} thereby was a gross assumption. There is ample evidence that she showed symptoms of <b>Stokes-Adams</b> <b>syndrome</b> for which the dilute acid was the standard remedy. No autopsy was carried out and from the eye-witness accounts it seems, in retrospect, almost certain that Mrs McLean suffered a fatal convulsion. Hence her death arose from a pre-existing condition and was independent of her location. Moreover, her having that syndrome without a heart pacemaker made a premature demise more or less inevitable.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Stokes-Adams</b> <b>{{syndrome}}</b> (alternative eponyms include Adams-Stokes syndrome, Gerbezius-Morgagni-Adams-Stokes {{syndrome and}} Gerbec-Morgagni-Adams-Stokes syndrome) is a periodic fainting spell {{in which there}} is a periodic onset and offset of blockage of heart due to disorder of heart rhythm that may last for seconds, hours, days, or even weeks before the conduction returns. Named after two Irish physicians, Robert Adams (1791 - 1875) and William Stokes (1804 - 1877), the first description of the syndrome was published in 1717 by the Carniolan physician of Slovene descent Marko Gerbec, which was 44 years after its publication quoted by Giovanni Battista Morgagni. It is characterised by decrease in cardiac output and loss of consciousness due to a transient arrhythmia. For example, bradycardia due to complete heart block.|$|E
40|$|A {{prospective}} study {{was carried out}} to determine the prognostic factors in patients with second-degree and complete heart block following acute myocardial infarction and to re-examine the indications for artificial transvenous pacing. Of the 117 consecutive patients with proved acute myocardial infarction, 15 developed advanced heart block (second degree and complete). The presence of the following factors, either alone or in combinations, were attended with poor prognosis: preceding <b>Stokes-Adams</b> <b>syndrome,</b> cardiogenic shock, congestive heart failure, complications secondary to cardiac arrest, anterior infarction and wide QRS complex. In the nine cases requiring artificial transvenous pacemaker because of Stokes-Adams attacks, congestive heart failure or frequent multifocal ventricular ectopic beats, there were five deaths. The remaining six patients, who were without complications and were not paced, all survived; these patients had normal QRS duration with heart rates above 60 per minute. This study indicates that prophylactic transvenous catheter insertion in acute heart block does not appear justified unless specific indication(s) arise. Postmortem studies revealed significant narrowing of all the major coronary vessels in all five fatalities. The overall mortality in this series of cases of acute heart block was 33 %...|$|E
