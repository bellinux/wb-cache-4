It has further pledged to invest £2.5 billion into the police service, promising to recruit 10,000 more officers. In addition, the group would reform education policy by aiming to cut school class sizes and scrapping tuition fees for UK students attending British universities; conversely, all foreign <b>students</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> required to pay in full.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1984 the New Order {{government}} used Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI as {{a propaganda}} vehicle, showing it annually on 30 September. The film was broadcast by the state-owned network TVRI, {{and later on}} private television stations after they were established. It was also shown at schools and government institutions; <b>students</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> taken to open fields to view the film in a group. Because of this use, Sen and Hill suggest that Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI is the most-broadcast and most-watched Indonesian film of all time. A 2000 survey by the Indonesian magazine Tempo found 97percent of the 1,101 students surveyed had seen the film; 87percent of them had seen it more than once.|$|E
5|$|For several centuries, {{education}} {{at one of}} the Inns of Chancery was the first step towards becoming a barrister. A student would first join one of the Inns of Chancery, where he would be taught in the form of moots and rote learning. He would also be taught by Readers sent from the Inn of Court that his Inn of Chancery was attached to, who would preside over the moots and discuss cases with the students. At the end of each legal term, particularly promising <b>students</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> transferred to the parent Inn of Court and begin the next stage of their education. By 1461 there were approximately 100 students studying at the Inns of Chancery at any one time.|$|E

50|$|Paul Pimsleur, {{also known}} for the Pimsleur {{language}} learning system, spent time researching four factors that he believed {{to be related to}} language learning aptitude. Pimsleur included grade point average as an indication of general academic achievement as well as motivation in his factors. In addition, the verbal ability factor indicated how well a <b>student</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> able to handle the mechanics of learning a foreign language and the auditory factor indicated how well a <b>student</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> able to listen to and produce phrases in a foreign language. To test these four factors, Pimsleur developed the Pimsleur Language Aptitude Battery.|$|R

5|$|On the {{day after}} the killings, the head of the State Treasury, Pekka Syrjänen, said that <b>students</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> able to seek {{compensation}} from the state for physical and psychological damage caused by the shootings. This was in accordance with the Crime Damage Act, which also stipulated that payments were to be adjusted in relation to other forms of compensation that the students received. Claimants were able to apply if they had suffered a loss of earnings, pain and suffering, or damage or loss to personal belongings {{as a consequence of the}} attack. Relatives were also able to gain compensation for costs incurred whilst caring for those affected, or funeral or hospital bills.|$|E
5|$|Prime Minister Harper's apology {{excluded}} Newfoundland and Labrador as it {{was argued}} {{that the government should}} not be held accountable for pre-Confederation actions. Residential schools in Newfoundland and Labrador were located in St. Anthony, Cartwright, North West River, Nain and Makkovik. These schools were run by the International Grenfell Association and the German Monrovian Missionaries. The government argued that because these schools were not created {{under the auspices of the}} Indian Act, they were not true residential schools. More than 1000 survivors disagreed and filed a class action lawsuit against the government for compensation in 2007. By the time the suit was settled in 2016, almost a decade later, dozens of plaintiffs had died. It was expected that up to 900 former <b>students</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> compensated.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary goal}} of the planned University of New England {{extension}} program was to provide opportunities for people to obtain a university degree who could not easily travel to attend lectures, often because they lived in rural areas. At this time, most Australian universities were opposed to external degree programs because, among other reasons, they considered that they diluted academic standards and provided a sub-standard education. Madgwick felt that these potential issues could be overcome by careful administration and appropriate financial support from the government. In setting up the program, Madgwick directed that the program's instructors also participate in internal education and should be considered {{on a par with}} their internal colleagues. The examinations given to external <b>students</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the same as those given to internal attendees. External students were required to attend some residential courses as part of their degree programs.|$|E

5|$|Zahorchak {{spearheaded the}} {{establishment}} of the Keystone Exams, state-created math, science and social studies tests that high school <b>students</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> required to pass a majority of in order to graduate. The measure was met with criticism by the Pennsylvania School Boards Association and others who felt the plan would be expensive and would undermine local school boards' authority to set graduation requirements. The PSBA agreed to support the Keystone Exams under a compromise that schools might not have to give the tests if their own final exams are rigorous enough. The Keystone Exams were approved in 2009 and will first take effect starting with the class of 2015. Zahorchak also established the state's Standards Aligned System, which created a standardized set of diagnostic tests and curriculum guides for local school districts. The standards were aligned to six components: a curriculum framework, assessment systems, best teaching practices, emotional support practices, proven research resources and best interventions for accommodations for children who struggle. Within two years, most public school districts within Pennsylvania were using Standards Aligned System in some form.|$|E

When the founders worried how <b>students</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> selected after their deaths, Godric Gryffindor took his hat off and they each added knowledge to it, allowing the Sorting Hat to choose the students by judging each student's qualities and placing them in the most appropriate house.

The northern states either refused to adopt a three-language formula, or wherever a three-language formula was implemented in the north, an option for taking Sanskrit was implemented, defeating the purpose of the policy itself.|$|E

The financial support they obtained from the Beijing government attracted even more students from Hunan, including Mao Zedong. Cai and Li told student leaders {{that the government had}} little money but would lend them transportation funds, in return, <b>students</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> expected to teach laborers in France.

25|$|Tucker {{initially}} arranged {{his classes}} into winter and summer sessions to avoid conflict with his judicial service. Originally, Tucker scheduled three-hour lectures {{three times a}} week during both sessions, but by 1798 he had added two lectures to the winter session and eliminated the summer session, since not all <b>students</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> in Williamsburg then. During sessions, Tucker's students usually read during the times they did not attend lectures. Students were also expected to study outside of sessions by reading the great treatises on English law. Tucker usually had students numbering in the mid-teens, even in the later part of the 1790s, when the College's total attendance was only about 50. Under Tucker's professorship, the College awarded its first Bachelor of Law (LL.B.) degree to William H. Cabell, who would become Governor of Virginia, then General Court judge, and finally a justice on the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia.|$|E
50|$|A {{minority}} of schools also designated the slipper as their official punishment implement {{instead of the}} cane, for more serious misbehaviour, especially infractions committed outside the classroom, such as smoking.
