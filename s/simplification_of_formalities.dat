The formalization in the role of chambers of commerce as issuing agencies for certificates of origin (CO) can be traced back to the 1923 Geneva Convention relating to the <b>Simplification</b> <b>of</b> Customs <b>Formalities</b> (Article 11) and has been reinforced with the updated Kyoto Convention.|$|R

It is a qualitative nature study on simplifying the legal language as a means of democratizing/pluralize access to justice, in the view of scholars and Law Course teachers. There is great difficulty by society in the understanding of legal terms, which hinders access to justice. Similarly, the legal field is not far, <b>of</b> their traditional <b>formalities,</b> which indicates the existence of a parallel where, on one hand, is society, with its problems of understanding, and the other the law, its inherent and intrinsic procedures. However, the company may not have access to the judiciary hampered on account <b>of</b> <b>formalities</b> arising from the law and its flowery language. Preliminary results indicate <b>simplification</b> <b>of</b> legal language as essential to real democratization of access to Law/Justice...|$|R

40|$|The {{incremental}} beautification of hand-drawn diagrams is {{a process}} that is poorly understood. Thus implementation of beautification techniques in computer-based sketch tools is ad hoc, with most only supporting the ends of the spectrum: handdrawn and fully formalized. Hand-drawn diagrams are more effective for early design and review but users are more satisfied with formal designs. This suggests that there may be applications for intermediate levels <b>of</b> <b>formality.</b> By understanding the attributes <b>of</b> visual <b>formality</b> it is possible to beautify a diagram progressively, thereby achieving visually consistent intermediate levels <b>of</b> <b>formality.</b> Here we present a taxonomy of the attributes <b>of</b> visual <b>formality</b> and the implementation of this taxonomy into a sketch tool...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects <b>of</b> {{increasing}} <b>formality</b> via tax reduction and simplification schemes on micro-firm performance. It uses the 1997 Brazilian SIMPLES program. We develop a simple theoretical model {{to show that}} SIMPLES has an impact only on {{a segment of the}} micro-firm population, for which the effect <b>of</b> <b>formality</b> on firm performance can be identified, and that can be analyzed along the single dimensional quantiles of the conditional firm revenues. To estimate the effect <b>of</b> <b>formality,</b> we use an econometric approach that compares eligible and non-eligible firms, born before and after SIMPLES in a local interval about the introduction of SIMPLES. We use an estimator that combines both quantile regression and the regression discontinuity identification strategy. The empirical results corroborate the positive effect <b>of</b> <b>formality</b> on microfirms' performance and produce a clear characterization of who benefits from these programs.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the impact <b>of</b> <b>formality</b> <b>of</b> employment on the utilisation of financial services, {{using data from}} the October 2000 Income and Expenditure Survey and the September 2000 Labour Force Survey. The presence of an employed member in the household is seen to be important for the utilisation of both bank accounts and funeral insurance, even after controlling for income. Furthermore there are strong links between the nature of this employment and utilisation of financial services. Employees are more likely to utilise financial services than the self-employed. Among employees, the probability of utilising financial services increases with the degree <b>of</b> <b>formality</b> <b>of</b> employment. These effects are stronger for formal banking services than for funeral insurance which includes informal burial societies. ...|$|R
40|$|Rejecting the {{conventional}} story that formalities in copyright law were abolished by the Berne Convention, this Article demonstrates that privately administered systems <b>of</b> <b>formalities</b> {{play a significant}} role in the administration of copyright law worldwide. Indeed, they must because copyright is designed to support a transaction structure which requires rightsholders who seek to attract licensing partners to go through some formal step to identify themselves and the works in which they have a legal or beneficial interest. Canvassing the landscape of mandatory and voluntary public and private systems <b>of</b> <b>formalities,</b> this article argues that: (1) national policymakers retain more policy authority under Berne to impose certain formal requirements on rightsholders than those with a formalist understanding <b>of</b> public <b>formalities</b> argue; (2) private systems <b>of</b> <b>formalities</b> are extensive, economically significant, but are not interoperable with each other in many cases and with voluntary registries and other voluntary public formalities systems; and (3) policymakers should use a mix of approaches to improve the functioning of both public and private formalities systems by promoting or requiring transparency, efficiency, and interoperability in their design and administration...|$|R
