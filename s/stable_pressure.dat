25|$|A {{demand valve}} detects when the diver starts inhaling and {{supplies}} the diver with {{a breath of}} gas at ambient pressure. This is done by a mechanical system linking a pressure differential sensor (diaphragm) to a valve which is opened to an extent proportional to the displacement of the diaphragm difference. The pressure difference between {{the inside of the}} mouthpiece and the ambient pressure outside the diaphragm required to open the valve is known as the cracking pressure. This cracking pressure difference is usually negative but may be slightly positive on a positive pressure regulator (a regulator that maintains a pressure inside the mouthpiece, mask or helmet, which is slightly greater than the ambient pressure). Once the valve has opened, gas flow should continue at the smallest <b>stable</b> <b>pressure</b> difference reasonably practicable while the diver inhales, and should stop as soon as gas flow stops. Several mechanisms have been devised to provide this function, some of them extremely simple and robust, and others somewhat more complex, but more sensitive to small pressure changes.|$|E

5000|$|An {{elastic bandage}} is a [...] "stretchable bandage {{used to create}} {{localized}} pressure". Elastic bandages are commonly used to treat muscle sprains and strains by reducing {{the flow of blood}} to a particular area by the application of even <b>stable</b> <b>pressure</b> which can restrict swelling at the place of injury. Elastic bandages are also used to treat bone fractures. Padding is applied to the fractured limb, then a splint (usually plaster) is applied. The elastic bandage is then applied to hold the splint in place and to protect it. This is a common technique for fractures which may swell, which would cause a cast to function improperly. These types of splints are usually removed after swelling has decreased and then a fiberglass or plaster cast can be applied.|$|E

5000|$|Nothing {{illustrates}} {{better the}} fundamental {{weakness of the}} Confederate command system than the weary series of telegrams exchanged in May and early June between Davis, Bragg, Beauregard, and Lee. Beauregard evaded his responsibility for determining what help he could give Lee; Davis and Bragg shirked their responsibility to decide, when he refused.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} was tested that pressure and pressure pulsation modulate vascular remodeling. Arterioles (similar to 200 mum lumen diameter) were dissected from rat cremaster muscle and studied in organoid culture. In the first series, arterioles were kept at a <b>stable</b> <b>pressure</b> level of either 50 or 100 mmHg for 3 days. Both groups showed a progressive increase in myogenic tone during the experiment. Arterioles kept at 50 mmHg showed larger endothelium-dependent dilation, compared with vessels kept at 100 mmHg on day 3. Remodeling, {{as indicated by}} the reduction in maximally dilated diameter at 100 mmHg, was larger in arterioles kept at 50 mmHg compared with 100 mmHg: 34 +/- 4. 5 versus 10 +/- 4. 8 mum (P < 0. 05). In the second series, arterioles were subjected to a <b>stable</b> <b>pressure</b> of 60 mmHg or oscillating pressure of 60 &PLUSMN; 10 mmHg (1. 5 Hz) for 4 days. Pressure pulsation induced partial dilation and was associated with less remodeling: 34 &PLUSMN; 4. 0 versus 19 &PLUSMN; 4. 5 μm (P < 0. 01) for <b>stable</b> <b>pressure</b> versus oscillating pressure.

In conclusion, these results indicate that remodeling is not enhanced by high pressure. Pressure pulsation causes partial dilation and reduces inward remodeling.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} outflow {{facility in}} isolated porcine eyes after {{creation of an}} intrascleral canal by injection of stabilized, nonanimal, hyaluronic acid gel (NASHA; Q-Med AB, Uppsala, Sweden). METHODS: Outflow facility of 60 porcine eyes was measured after creation of an intrascleral canal into the anterior chamber by injection of NASHA gel using six different combinations of needle size (21, 23, and 27 gauge) and canal length (4. 6 mm). Ten eyes were tested {{in each of the}} six subgroups and an additional 10 were control eyes. After cannulation of the anterior chamber and adjustment of the inflow rate to achieve a <b>stable</b> <b>pressure</b> of 10 mm Hg, an intrascleral channel was created by injection of NASHA gel. The inflow rate was then increased to achieve a <b>stable</b> <b>pressure</b> of 20 mm Hg and then again adjusted to maintain a <b>stable</b> <b>pressure</b> of 30 mm Hg. RESULTS: A significant increase in outflow facility was found between the control group and the NASHA gel-injected group (60 eyes) for both the 10 - to 20 -mm Hg and the 20 - to 30 -mm Hg pressure change (P < 0. 001). Increase in outflow facility was independent of the canal lengths and the needle sizes used for both the 10 - to 20 -mm Hg (P = 0. 82) and 20 - to 30 -mm Hg (P = 0. 99) pressure change. CONCLUSIONS: A single ab externo intrascleral canal created by injection of NASHA gel increases the outflow facility in isolated porcine eyes. This is a potentially promising new technique for lowering intraocular pressure. It {{remains to be seen whether}} these positive results can be reproduced for significant periods in humans...|$|E

40|$|It {{is shown}} {{theoretically}} that LHD has potentiality toward the high beta plasma confinement. The chaotic field line-layer, which surrounds {{the outside of}} the outermost magnetic surface, plays a key role for an efficient plasma confinement in LHD. The plasma in the chaotic field line region prevents an immediate cooling of the core plasma caused by neutral atoms in the vacuum vessel.

Previous work related to ExoMars Raman studies by Sobron and Wang [20] estimated that the rover operation temperature range would be between 243  K and 283  K during Raman measurements and we await final operating conditions to be released by ESA.

In addition, rapid changes in temperature would subject the optics of space instruments to thermal stresses. Therefore, it was required to control the rate of heating or cooling of different parts of the MASC. To fully assess the effect of low pressure on the instrument performance, it was desirable to design a chamber with the flexibility to produce <b>stable</b> <b>pressures</b> from a vacuum (~ 4 × 10 − 5  mbar) to a pressure of a 6 – 10  mbar of CO 2 as expected on Mars.
