25|$|After {{returning}} to Fitzroy Crossing, Oscar worked in state government community welfare and health departments, before becoming the Junjuwa Community Women’s Resource Officer in 1989. She then became the Chairperson of the Marra Worra Worra Aboriginal Corporation, one of Australia’s {{oldest and most}} respected Aboriginal community centres, until 1991, when she was appointed Commissioner of the Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Commission for a 2-year term. When she was 29 years old, Oscar {{received a phone call}} from Aboriginal Affairs Minister Robert Tickner asking her to join the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. <b>She</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> the phone because she thought the call was a hoax but then decided to call him back.|$|E
2500|$|Following the 2008 elections, then President-elect Barack Obama rang Ros-Lehtinen {{to congratulate}} {{her on her}} re-election. <b>She</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> on him, believing {{that it was a}} prank call from a radio station. [...] She did the same to Obama's chief of staff Rahm Emanuel when he rang to confirm the {{original}} call was genuine, and only accepted the call after Congressman Howard Berman managed to speak to her.|$|E
2500|$|Stephanie Leonidas as Helena Campbell, a young circus {{performer}} and aspiring artist who is {{drawn into a}} mysterious world of masked people and monsters shortly after her mother is hospitalized. It is eventually revealed that the world she entered was created through her own drawings that <b>she</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> {{on the walls of}} her room. Leonidas stated that she expected that filming would be difficult because most of the scenes were done with one or two other actors just with a bluescreen in the background, but also said that [...] "it all came alive" [...] for them when they started working.|$|E
60|$|Christie walked rapidly {{into the}} house, {{and by the}} time she got there the absurdity of her fancy struck her, and she stifled a laugh {{in the depths of the}} little pumpkin-hood, as <b>she</b> <b>hung</b> it <b>up.</b> Then, {{assuming}} her gravest air, she went to give the finishing touches to dinner.|$|R
6000|$|The {{poor girl}} she had serv'd with them [...] Some half-a-year, or more, [...] When <b>she</b> was found <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> one day [...] Stiff as a corpse and cold as clay [...] Behind that stable door! ...|$|R
25|$|On Mount Royals {{launch date}} of April 9, 1902, <b>she</b> got <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> during the launch, and {{after two hours}} was freed, only {{to get caught up}} again, this time {{swinging}} into the bank. It would be several more days before she was successfully launched into the bay. A bad launch was considered to be an ill omen and, in this case, was one that would be fulfilled.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> the {{receiver}} thoughtfully, paused a moment, {{and went back}} to the drawing-room. Brent looked up.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> the {{receiver}} quickly, to cut short a fresh outburst of protest. And {{as she turned}} away a voice spoke behind her.|$|E
60|$|Mary Louise hesitated; then <b>she</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> the {{receiver}} without reply. It {{occurred to her}} that the hotel office was a public place and that the telephone girl would be likely to yell out the number for all to overhear.|$|E
50|$|On May 16, 2016, the Pirates {{promoted}} Hanson to {{the major}} league club after Starling Marte went on paternity leave. Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said that Hanson {{would return to the}} minors when Marte returned. Hurdle noted that Hanson would likely be recalled again later in the season, but still had yet to prove himself in Triple-A. Hanson said that, when he called his mother to tell her the news, <b>she</b> accidentally <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> and celebrated, while Hanson waited in silence for nearly 10 minutes.|$|R
5000|$|... "The Bozo" [...] made {{national}} headlines when {{he helped}} to catch a robber at a convenience store in Camilla, Georgia. Sommers was talking live {{on the air with}} regular caller Linda Driskill, known as [...] "Mississippi Lady" [...] to listeners, when he heard Driskill admonish someone not to come behind her counter. <b>She</b> then <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> the phone. Sommers was concerned for her safety, so he called the Camilla police (who knew Driskill from Sommers' show). The police responded to Driskill's store and quickly apprehended the robber.|$|R
50|$|At {{the age of}} eighteen, Davies called time on {{the first}} stage of her {{swimming}} career to build her television profile and a career in modelling. In 1989, and training at Bracknell & Wokingham Swimming Club, she returned to the pool, where she picked up two more medals at the 1990 Commonwealth Games. By the time <b>she</b> finally <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> her swimsuit for good in 1994, she had been a British champion on twenty occasions and had broken two hundred British swimming records and 5 World Masters records (eligible to those over 30).|$|R
6000|$|... "All right," [...] {{said the}} girl, [...] "I'll be there. You {{tell him that}} he simply must come." [...] <b>She</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> the {{receiver}} and then called a taxi. She gave a number on a side street about a half block away, where she knew it would be reasonably dark, and consequently less danger of detection.|$|E
60|$|She {{would not}} come. Overpowered by wind and sea, <b>she</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> {{for a few}} moments, and then fell off on her {{previous}} course. They tried it twice, not daring to wear her round the opposite way; and afterward {{they sat in the}} slight shelter of the coaming, conscious that there was nothing more they could do.|$|E
6000|$|AND <b>she</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> {{all sorts}} and sizes of clothes-- small brown coats of mice; and one velvety black mole-skin waist coat; {{and a red}} tail-coat with no tail {{belonging}} to Squirrel Nutkin; and a very much shrunk jacket belonging to Peter Rabbit; and a petticoat, not marked, that had gone lost in the washing --and at last the basket was empty! ...|$|E
50|$|John and Barbara Walker {{divorced}} in 1976. Their marriage {{was marked by}} physical abuse and alcohol. By 1980 Barbara had begun regularly abusing alcohol and was very fearful for her children. She wanted the children not {{to become involved in}} the spy ring, and that led to constant disagreement with John. Barbara tried several times to contact the Boston office of the FBI, but <b>she</b> either <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> or was too drunk to speak. In November 1984 she again contacted the Boston office and in a drunken confession reported that her ex-husband spied for the Soviet Union. She did not then know that Michael had become an active participant, and later admitted she would not have reported the spy ring had she known her son was involved.|$|R
2500|$|Then in 1900, Cunningham sent Bonser down to Victoria {{to design}} a sternwheeler. This would become the Hazelton, and under Bonser’s command she soon proved to be {{superior}} to the other boats on the Skeena. In her first season, she went to Hazelton thirteen times, making the trip upstream in forty hours and downstream in ten. Realizing that the Strathcona and the Caledonia could not compete, the HBC built a third sternwheeler, the Mount Royal and hired Captain Johnson as her pilot. On her launch date, April 9, 1902, <b>she</b> got <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> during her launch, and after two hours was freed, only {{to get caught up}} again. A bad launch was considered to be an ill omen and, in this case, was one that would be fulfilled.|$|R
50|$|While eating out, the Solis family discovers John {{owns the}} {{restaurant}} and Gaby finds out that John is now divorced. Later, John visits Carlos at work {{to see if it}} was alright if Ana worked as a hostess at his restaurant. Gaby refuses to let Ana work there but Carlos knows <b>she</b> is still <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> and revealed that he said Ana could work there to test Gaby. Gaby reminds Carlos that she stood by him all these years and does not need to be worried about her.|$|R
60|$|She went {{directly}} to her apartment and presently took down the telephone-receiver, and after calling a public phone in a building down-town, she listened intently while the operator was getting her connection, and before the connection was made <b>she</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> the receiver with a smile, for she had distinctly {{heard the sound of}} a man's breathing over the line, and she knew that in all probability O'Donnell had tapped in immediately on learning that she had been released from jail.|$|E
60|$|The {{young girl}} entered the house, {{followed}} by the old man, passing an old woman seated by the window, {{who seemed to be}} nursing her resentment and a large Bible which she held clasped against her shawled bosom at the same moment. Going to the wall, <b>she</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> her large hat and slightly shook the red dust from her skirts as she continued her explanation, in the same deep voice, with a certain monotony of logic and possibly of purpose and practice also.|$|E
6000|$|A click. No {{answer to}} Claire's urgent hellos. <b>She</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> the {{receiver}} very, very carefully. She hated {{to turn and}} face her audience of Mr. Henry B. Boltwood, Mr. James Barmberry, Mrs. James Barmberry, and four Barmberry buds averaging five and a quarter in age. She {{tried to ignore the}} Barmberrys, but their silence was noisy and interested while she informed her father, [...] "It's Jeff Saxton! Out here to see copper mines. Telephoned along road to catch us. Says we're to wait dinner till he comes." ...|$|E
5000|$|Both {{her father}} and her elder brother, John, were called up {{to fight in the}} {{trenches}} of [...] "The Great War". She left school at the age of fourteen and, from 1914 to 1918, worked full-time at Waverley Cabinet Works as an apprentice French polisher, and became an active member of her trade union. Her one disagreement with the manager was over a discarded picture of Our Lady she found amongst the junk of the cabinet works. <b>She</b> <b>hung</b> it <b>up</b> over her workplace. The manager took it down and each morning she restored it to its place. Margaret, and her sister Bella, struggled to support their mother with their minimal wages and also worked an allotment. It was a cruel struggle to pay the rent and to feed themselves. Whenever her mother broke down and wept, Margaret had one unvarying answer, [...] "Dinnae give in".|$|R
50|$|In November 2011, a new doctor, Maggie Wurth, {{comes to}} General Hospital {{and it is}} {{revealed}} {{that she was the}} girl Steven proposed to. When she first shows up in town, she is dressed as a clown, wearing a mask and lurking around the hospital. We see her spying on Steve, and others while in disguise. It is later revealed that in Memphis, Steve killed a prisoner, who was his patient, when Maggie came to him needed the prisoner's heart to save a little girl she was treating. Olivia is originally suspicious of Maggie, and assumes <b>she</b> is still <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> on Steve; but Steve assures there that she has nothing to worry about.|$|R
50|$|Sheik Omar Al Sayed (Maurizio Rasti) He and {{his brother}} are very {{powerful}} players in the racing world. He purchases the best horses to race. He originally came to Raintree to see if Wildfire qualified to race in the Gold Cup, then returned wanting to purchase Wildfire. Later on, {{he came back to}} town to host the Bristol Stakes and had a brief flirtation with Dani. She did not reciprocate the feelings because <b>she</b> was still <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> on RJ. He then proceeded to organize an illegal match race between Raintree and Davis Farms with a purse of two million dollars, with some of his investors. He is not heard from again after the season 3 finale.|$|R
60|$|She {{had been}} a week in town before Morrison telephoned her and added his welcome. Despite the gay gladness of his voice, it irritated her. Really, she {{scarcely}} wanted to see him. But a meeting was inevitable, and besides, going out with him was {{in accordance with the}} plan she had adopted. So she made an engagement to meet him at the Plaza for dinner. When with slow and pondering action <b>she</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> the receiver {{it occurred to her that}} she resented the idea of going to the Plaza. She did not dwell on the reason why.|$|E
6000|$|When Anne {{reached the}} school that morning [...] . {{for the first time}} in her life she had traversed the Birch Path deaf and blind to its beauties [...] . all was quiet and still. The {{preceding}} teacher had trained the children to be in their places at her arrival, and when Anne entered the schoolroom she was confronted by prim rows of [...] "shining morning faces" [...] and bright, inquisitive eyes. <b>She</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> her hat and faced her pupils, hoping that she did not look as frightened and foolish as she felt and that they would not perceive how she was trembling.|$|E
60|$|Joan of Arc, who {{had never}} been {{defeated}} by the enemy, was defeated by her own King. She had said once that all she feared for her cause was treachery. It had struck its first blow now. <b>She</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> her white armor in the royal basilica of St. Denis, and went and asked the King to relieve her of her functions and let her go home. As usual, she was wise. Grand combinations, far-reaching great military moves were at an end, now; for the future, when the truce should end, the war would be merely a war of random and idle skirmishes, apparently; work suitable for subalterns, and not requiring the supervision of a sublime military genius. But the King would not let her go. The truce did not embrace all France; there were French strongholds to be watched and preserved; he would need her. Really, you see, Tremouille wanted to keep her where he could balk and hinder her.|$|E
60|$|She {{never went}} {{more than a}} few yards from the house, and indeed never put her foot over the {{threshold}} without looking carefully out of each window in order to be sure that there was nobody about. By this I knew that she suspected that her fellow-countryman was still in the neighbourhood, and feared that he might attempt to carry her off. She did something else which was significant. I had an old revolver with some cartridges, which had been thrown away among the rubbish. She found this one day, and at once proceeded to clean it and oil it. <b>She</b> <b>hung</b> it <b>up</b> near the door, with the cartridges in a little bag beside it, and whenever I went for a walk, she would take it down and insist upon my carrying it with me. In my absence she would always bolt the door. Apart from her apprehensions she seemed fairly happy, busying herself in helping Madge when she was not attending upon me. She was wonderfully nimble-fingered and natty in all domestic duties.|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "Scream For Me", Sydney is {{changing}} in the Rosewood High locker rooms when Emily approaches her. Emily couldn't watch practice because <b>she</b> got <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> {{in the language}} lab before thanking Sydney for helping Hanna sober up the night before. She questions Sydney about what Hanna might've said and whether she mentioned New York. Sydney says she didn't and wonders why Emily really came into the locker rooms. Sydney discloses to Emily the team wants her to be the assistant coach, but Emily says she already has a lot going on. Walking into Emily’s bedroom, Sydney hands Emily the hooded sweatshirt and says she got ahead of herself. She explains that since they've stopped training together, Driscoll just wanted to have someone in the bleachers cheering for her, since her boyfriend is off in college and her parents aren't into it. Sydney lets it slip that she knows Emily and her friends were in New York, but covers when Emily points out her lie by saying she must've been mixed up from {{too much time in}} the pool.|$|R
2500|$|In October 1918, the King & Winge {{was present}} {{at one of the}} great tragedies of Alaskan {{maritime}} history, the wreck of the Princess Sophia.

6000|$|The Kaatsberg or Catskill {{mountains}} {{have always}} been a region full of fable. The Indians considered them the abode of spirits, who influenced the weather, spreading sunshine or clouds over the landscape, and sending good or bad hunting seasons. They were ruled by an old squaw spirit, said to be their mother. She dwelt on the highest peak of the Catskills, and had charge of the doors of day and night to open and shut them at the proper hour. <b>She</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> the new moons in the skies, and cut up the old ones into stars. In times of drought, if properly propitiated, she would spin light summer clouds out of cobwebs and morning dew, and send them off from the crest of the mountain, flake after flake, like flakes of carded cotton, to float in the air; until, dissolved by the heat of the sun, they would fall in gentle showers, causing the grass to spring, the fruits to ripen, and the corn to grow an inch an hour. If displeased, however, she would brew up clouds black as ink, sitting in the midst of them like a bottle-bellied spider in the midst of its web; and when these clouds broke, woe betide the valleys! ...|$|E
60|$|Marjorie's mind leapt {{very rapidly}} to the {{possibilities}} of this little establishment. The panelling must be done and done well, anyhow; that {{would be no more}} than a wise economy, seeing it might at any time help them to re-let; it would be painted white, of course, and thus set the key for a clean brightness of colour throughout. The furniture would stand out against the softly shining white, and its line and proportions must be therefore the primary qualities to consider as she bought it. The study was much narrower than the dining-room, and so the passage, which the agent called the hall, was much broader and more commodious behind the happily wide staircase than in front, and she was able to banish out of the sight of the chance visitor all that litter of hat-stand and umbrella-stand, letters, boxes arriving and parcels to post, which had always offended her eye at home. At home there had been often the most unsightly things visible, one of Theo's awful caps, or his school books, and not infrequently her father's well-worn and all too fatally comfortable house slippers. A good effect at first is half the victory of a well done house, and Marjorie accomplished another of her real economies here by carpeting hall and staircase with a fine-toned, rich-feeling and rather high-priced blue carpet, held down by very thick brass stair-rods. <b>She</b> <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> four well-chosen steel engravings, put a single Chippendale chair in the hall, and a dark old Dutch clock that {{had turned out to be}} only five pounds when she had expected the shopman to say eleven or twelve, on the half-landing. That was all. Round the corner by the study door was a mahogany slab, and the litter all went upon a capacious but very simple dark-stained hat-stand and table that were out of the picture entirely until you reached the stairs.|$|E

60|$|Strangely enough, Cissy did not hail this {{corroboration}} of her dislike {{to young}} Masterton with the liveliness {{one might have}} expected. Perhaps it was because Piney Tibbs was no longer present, having left Cissy at the parsonage and returned home. Still she enjoyed her visit after a fashion, romped with the younger Windibrooks and climbed a tree in the security of her sylvan seclusion and the promptings of her still healthy, girlish blood, and only came back to cake and tea and her new hat, which <b>she</b> had prudently <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> in the summer-house, as the afternoon was waning. When {{they returned to the}} house, they found that Mr. Windibrook had gone out with his visitor, and Cissy was spared the advertisement of a boisterous escort home, which he generally insisted upon. She gayly took leave of the infant Windibrook and his mother, sallied out into the empty road, and once more became conscious of her new hat.|$|R
