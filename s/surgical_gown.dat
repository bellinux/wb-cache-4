40|$|<b>Surgical</b> <b>gowns</b> are {{considered}} non active medical devices. They can be single-use or reusable and during an operation {{they are in}} constant contact with the human skin. Interaction with human senses is therefore an important performance property. When touched by the human hand, friction {{is one of the}} first feelings and therefore friction coefficient is an important parameter. A parameter laboratory instrument was designed at the University of Minho based on an innovative method of acessing friction coefficient of 2 D surfaces (fabrics, nonwovens, soft papers). Unlike other methods, the instrument FRICTORQ is based on a rotary movement and therefore on the measurement of a friction reaction torque. A short description of the FRICTORQ instrument will be given as well as its fundamentals and working principle followed by a study, where a comparison of the coefficient of friction between three different materials for manufacturing <b>surgical</b> <b>gowns</b> was performed.

In this study, nonwoven fabrics spunbond polypropylene, polyester basis weight of 25  g/m 2 and microporous PTFE film were used to develop tri-laminate antiviral <b>surgical</b> <b>gown.</b> The outer layer of spunbond polypropylene was treated with plasma enhanced fluorocarbon. The plasma treated polypropylene was also treated with titanium nano dispersion finish in a single bath pad-dry-cure method. The pore sizes of nonwoven fabrics were characterized using tri-nocular microscope. The titanium nano finished polypropylene was characterized by scanning electron microscope. The tri-laminate <b>surgical</b> <b>gown</b> was developed with outer layer of plasma treated polypropylene, middle layer of PTFE and inner layer of polyester nonwoven. Liquid barrier properties of surgical performance were analyzed by viral penetration, antibacterial, spray impact penetration, hydrostatic resistance, tensile properties and moisture vapour permeability to estimate their suitability for antiviral <b>surgical</b> <b>gown.</b> It is observed that plasma treated gown shows 99.04 % bacterial reduction as compared to untreated, thus providing barrier against microbes. The plasma treatment does not alter the weight and tensile properties of <b>surgical</b> <b>gown.</b> The developed plasma enhanced flurocarbon treated tri-laminate <b>surgical</b> <b>gown</b> offer sufficient liquid barrier properties for level 4 protection as per Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation classification. Moisture vapour transfer rate of plasma treated tri-laminate gown decreased by 21 % in comparison with untreated nonwoven gown.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} thermal comfort properties of surgical gowns made of dual functional finish cotton and nonwoven fabrics which have barrier properties of blood and micro-organism. Four types of surgical gowns, which were made of nonwoven fabrics with finish or without and were made of cotton with finish or without, were tested. The thermal insulations of four surgical gowns were measured with thermal manikin. Subjective experiments on thermal comfort, skin temperature and clothing microclimate were conducted. Six male subjects, between 26 and 28 years age old, participated in the wear trials tests. Typical activities for surgeons in the operation theater were simulated during the experimental sessions. Air temperature in a climate chamber was kept at 22 ℃ and its humidity was 60 %RH. Air velocity was controlled at less than 0. 15 m/s. Inner radiant temperature was almost equal to the air temperature. Basic thermal insulation of the dual functional finished nonwoven <b>surgical</b> <b>gown</b> was 0. 87 clo, which was slightly higher than that of untreated (0. 84 clo). However, the skin temperature of the subj ect wearing a dual functional finished <b>surgical</b> <b>gown</b> was significantly lower at P. 05. When the subject wears the dual functional finished gown, the amount of sweating was less than that when wearing untreated. Microclimate temperature and humidity of dual functional finished <b>surgical</b> <b>gown</b> were lower than untreated and it was statistically significant. There was no significant difference in subjective humid and overall comfort sensation between finished and untreated ones. Thermal sensation of dual functional finished one was significantly different from untreated one only during the first exercise. The results of this study indicate that the dual functional finish <b>surgical</b> <b>gown</b> allowed heat to be transferred from the skin of subject to the atmosphere better than untreated. The nonwoven <b>surgical</b> <b>gown</b> showed no difference in comfort properties from cotton one...|$|E

Nonwoven disposable materials now in use range from those which remain impermeable to moist bacterial permeation through all tests while some remain impermeable for limited periods of time, and others almost immediately permeable to moist bacterial penetration. The same situation holds for woven materials. Under conditions of our test, Quarpel treated Pima tight-woven cotton cloth was impermeable to moist bacterial strike-through, through up to 75 washing and sterilizing cyclings, while ordinary linen and untreated Pima cloth permitted bacterial permeation almost immediately.

30|$|Spun bond {{polypropylene}} and polyester nonwoven fabrics {{were obtained}} from Mogul nonwoven industry, Turkey. The diameter of the individual polypropylene filament was approximately 0.2 microns and diameter of the individual polyester filament was 0.8 microns. The basis weights of the both nonwoven fabrics were 25 grams per square meter. The prime components of this research are polypropylene and polyester nonwoven fabrics. As polypropylene fibre has stereo-regular isotactic molecular structure, due to its high degree of crystallinity, good handling, strength and a high enough melting point for normal use, it is being used in many industrial applications, {{as well as in}} healthcare protective clothing. It has non polar and hydrophobic nature which is a good liquid repellent property. Considering its liquid barrier protection PP nonwoven is used as an outer layer in the developed <b>surgical</b> <b>gown.</b> Polyester nonwoven fabric is used as an inner layer in the developed <b>surgical</b> <b>gown</b> because of its wickability characteristics.
