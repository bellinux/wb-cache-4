2500|$|A {{rogue wave}} {{is a natural}} ocean {{phenomenon}} that is not caused by land movement, only lasts briefly, occurs in a limited location, and most often happens far out at sea. Rogue waves are considered rare but potentially very dangerous, since they can involve the spontaneous formation of massive waves far beyond the usual expectations of ship designers, and can overwhelm the usual capabilities of ocean-going vessels which are not designed for such encounters. Rogue waves are therefore distinct from tsunamis. Tsunamis are caused by massive displacement of water, often resulting from sudden movement of the ocean floor, after which they propagate at high speed over a wide area. They are nearly unnoticeable in deep water and only become dangerous as they approach the shoreline and the ocean floor becomes shallower; therefore tsunamis do not present a threat to shipping at sea (the only ships lost in the 2004 Asian tsunami were in port). They are also distinct from megatsunamis, which are single massive waves caused by sudden impact, such as meteor impact or landslides within enclosed or limited bodies of water. They are also different from the waves described as [...] "hundred-year waves", which is a purely <b>statistical</b> <b>prediction</b> of the highest wave {{likely to occur in}} a hundred-year period in a particular body of water.|$|E

50|$|Techniques such as branch {{prediction}} and speculative execution {{are used to}} lessen these branch penalties. Branch prediction is where the hardware makes educated guesses on whether a particular branch will be taken. In reality {{one side or the}} other of the branch will be called much more often than the other. Modern designs have rather complex <b>statistical</b> <b>prediction</b> systems, which watch the results of past branches to predict the future with greater accuracy. The guess allows the hardware to prefetch instructions without waiting for the register read. Speculative execution is a further enhancement in which the code along the predicted path is not just prefetched but also executed before it is known whether the branch should be taken or not. This can yield better performance when the guess is good, with the risk of a huge penalty when the guess is bad because instructions need to be undone.|$|E

Such markets, which may be operated publicly or as an internal market, are just one of several promising frontiers in predictive futures research.|$|E
