40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel method to {{identify}} the power-in regions of long flexible cylinders subjected to vortex-induced vibration (VIV). It also attempts to address a practical problem: “Will a secondary power-in region appear after the primary power-in region is covered with suppression devices?” The source of data is a recent model test on a 38 meter long flexible cylinder, densely instrumented with fiber optic strain gauges and accelerometers. For pipes with partial coverage of <b>suppression</b> <b>devices</b> in uniform flow, the bare region {{would be expected to}} be a power-in region and the section with <b>suppression</b> <b>devices</b> {{is expected to be a}} power-out region. Experimental data from these types of tests are used to benchmark the proposed power-in zone identification method. The method is then used {{to identify the}} power-in zones on a bare cylinder in a sheared flow. This paper also explores the occurrence of secondary power-in regions that may exist, when <b>suppression</b> <b>devices</b> are placed in the primary power-in zone. Secondary power-in regions were observed.

Two passive noise <b>suppression</b> <b>devices</b> located on the flaps produced moderate to large noise reductions at reduced separation distances. Consideration of the static aerodynamic performance data obtained for the configurations tested suggests that specific broadband noise suppression characteristics may be obtained through a trade-off with aerodynamic performance penalties by the careful selection of <b>suppression</b> <b>devices...</b>|$|R

40|$|A spray-suppression {{model that}} captures {{the effects of}} liquid {{suppressant}} on a turbulent combusting flow is developed and applied to a turbulent diffusion flame with water <b>spray</b> <b>suppression.</b> The <b>spray</b> submodel {{is based on a}} stochastic separated flow approach that accounts for the transport and evaporation of liquid droplets. Flame extinguishment is accounted for by using a perfectly stirred reactor (PSR) submodel of turbulent combustion. PSR pre-calculations of flame extinction times are determined using CHEMKIN and are compared to local turbulent time scales of the flow to determine if local flame extinguishment has occurred. The PSR flame extinguishment and spray submodels are incorporated into Sandia's flow fire simulation code, VULCAN, and cases are run for the water <b>spray</b> <b>suppression</b> studies of McCaffrey for turbulent hydrogen-air jet diffusion flames. Predictions of flame temperature decrease and suppression efficiency are compared to experimental data as a function of water mass loading using three assumed values of drop sizes. The results show that the suppression efficiency is highly dependent on the initial droplet size for a given mass loading. A predicted optimal suppression efficiency was observed for the smallest class of droplets while the larger drops show increasing suppression efficiency with increasing mass loading for the range of mass loadings considered. Qualitative agreement to the experiment of suppression efficiency is encouraging, however quantitative agreement is limited due to the uncertainties in the boundary conditions of the experimental data for the water spray...|$|R
40|$|Small {{scale model}} {{acoustic}} experiments {{were conducted to}} measure the noise produced in the flyover and sideline planes by an engine under the wing externally blown flap configuration in its approach attitude.

Experiments were also conducted to determine the noise suppression effectiveness in comparison with a reference configuration of three passive types of devices that were located on the jet impingement surfaces of the reference configuration. These devices produced noise reductions that varied up to 10 dB at reduced separation distances. In addition, a qualitative estimate of the noise suppression characteristics of the separate devices was made.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of this chapter are {{to review and}} summarize the jet noise suppression technology, to provide a physical and theoretical model to explain the measured jet noise suppression characteristics of different concepts, {{and to provide a}} set of guidelines for evolving jet noise suppression designs. The underlying principle for all jet noise <b>suppression</b> <b>devices</b> is to enhance rapid mixing (i. e., diffusion) of the jet plume by geometric and aerothermodynamic means. In the case of supersonic jets, the shock-cell broadband noise reduction is effectively accomplished by the elimination or mitigation of the shock-cell structure. So far, the diffusion concepts have predominantly concentrated on jet momentum and energy (kinetic and thermal) diffusion, in that order, and have yielded better noise reduction than the simple conical nozzles. A critical technology issue that needs resolution is the effect of flight on the noise suppression potential of mechanical suppressor nozzles. A more thorough investigation of this mechanism is necessary for the successful development and design of an acceptable noise <b>suppression</b> <b>device</b> for future high-speed civil transports...|$|R
