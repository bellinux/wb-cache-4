40|$|Instability in the {{propagation}} of nonlinear electro-chemical waves in the heart is responsible for life-threatening disease. This thesis describes {{an investigation of the}} effects of boundaries on cardiac wave propagation that arises from a site where an electrical stimulus is applied or from boundaries beyond which current does not flow. It is generally believed that the spatial scale for boundary effects is approximately equal to the passive length constant, lambda, of the tissue, the distance over which a a voltage pulse decays when it is below the threshold for wave generation. From the results of in vitro experiments with bullfrog cardiac tissue and through numerical simulations, I find that boundaries affect wave propagation over a much larger spatial scale and that the spatial variation in some cardiac restitution properties is correlated statistically with the onset of alternans, a possible precursor to fibrillation in the human heart. An optical imaging system using novel illumination based on LEDs is used to determine the spatial dependence of action potential duration (APD) and the slope of the dynamic restitution curve <b>S</b> <b>DRC,</b> which describes the relationship between steady-state APD and diastolic interval. For tissue with nearly identical cells, I find that APD is longest near the stimulus and shortest near the physical boundary with significant changes (~ 100 ms) over a distance of ~ 10 lambda. <b>S</b> <b>DRC</b> decreases with distance from the stimulus at a constant rate (~ 0. 1 - 1. 5 /mm) over the surface of the tissue. Simulations using a two-variable cardiac model confirm that spatial patterns of APD and <b>S</b> <b>DRC</b> can be induced by boundaries. Additional measurements with the simultaneous impalement of two microelectrodes are used to determine the spatial differences of other restitution properties. These studies indicate that APD and <b>S</b> <b>DRC,</b> as well as the slopes of the constant-BCL and S 1 S 2 restitution curves, vary in space and that the spatial differences and onset of alternans at rapid pacing are correlated. If similar correlations are evident in humans, such measurements may identify patients who are susceptible to arrhythmias and allow for early treatment. Dissertatio...|$|E
40|$|The TOR kinase, {{which is}} present in the {{functionally}} distinct complexes TORC 1 and TORC 2, is essential for growth but associated with disease and aging. Elucidation of how TOR influences life span will identify mechanisms of fundamental importance in aging and TOR functions. Here we show that when TORC 1 is inhibited genetically in C. elegans, SKN- 1 /Nrf, and DAF- 16 /FoxO activate protective genes, and increase stress resistance and longevity. SKN- 1 also upregulates TORC 1 pathway gene expression in a feedback loop. Rapamycin triggers a similar protective response in C. elegans and mice, but increases worm life span dependent upon SKN- 1 and not DAF- 16, apparently by interfering with TORC 2 along with TORC 1. TORC 1, TORC 2, and insulin/IGF- 1 -like signaling regulate SKN- 1 activity through different mechanisms. We conclude that modulation of SKN- 1 /Nrf and DAF- 16 /FoxO may be generally important in the effects of TOR signaling in vivo and that these transcription factors mediate an opposing relationship between growth signals and longevity.

40|$|The use of Streptococcus diacetylactis as {{a flavor}} {{producer}} in dairy fermentations {{is dependent upon}} its ability to produce diacetyl from citrate. Treatment of S. diacetylactis strains 18 - 16 and DRC 1 with acridine orange resulted in the conversion of approximately 2 % of the DRC 1 population and 20 % of the 18 - 16 population to citrate negative, which {{is indicative of the}} involvement of plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Growth in the presence of acridine orange also resulted in the appearance of 2 % lactose-negative derivatives in S. diacetylactis 18 - 16 and 99 % lactose-defective, proteinase-negative derivatives in <b>S.</b> diacetylactis <b>DRC</b> 1. Cesium chloride-ethidium bromide equilibrium density gradients of cleared lysate material from each strain revealed the presence of covalently closed circular DNA. Samples of this covalently closed circular DNA were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis to determine the plasmid composition of each strain. S. diacetylactis 18 - 16 was found to possess six plasmids, of approximately 41, 28, 6. 4, 5. 5, 3. 4, and 3. 0 megadaltons (Mdal). <b>S.</b> diacetylactis <b>DRC</b> 1 contained six plasmids, of approximately 41, 31, 18, 5. 5, 4. 5, and 3. 7 Mdal. Variants of S. diacetylactis 18 - 16 which failed to produce acetoin plus diacetyl from citrate (citrate negative) were missing a 5. 5 -Mdal plasmid. Lactose-negative mutants of the same strain were devoid of a 41 -Mdal plasmid. Lactose-defective, proteinase-negative mutants of <b>S.</b> diacetylactis <b>DRC</b> 1 were missing a 31 -Mdal plasmid. The citrate-negative mutants of <b>S.</b> diacetylactis <b>DRC</b> 1 isolated in this study did not possess a 5. 5 -Mdal plasmid.

40|$|Journal articleThe {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to analyse the evolving living conditions across the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) between 1970 and 2010. In the mid- 1970 <b>s,</b> the <b>DRC</b> (Zaire) entered a long downward spiral, which can be read as a textbook example of state failure and economic regress: the 1973 nationalization policy of Mobutu formed the starting point; the first African world war (1998 - 2003) was a brutal low. Over this period, the average Congolese saw his income decrease to only one fifth of the level he attained in the 1970 s. Surprisingly enough, this economic decay of the country did not seem to have much affected the survival chances of its population: both life expectancy and mortality rates even improved a bit. In short, viewed through a macro-economic telescope everybody must have been moribund, but through a microscope many seemed to be alive and kicking. To solve this “Congo puzzle”, five hypotheses will be put forward. Whereas the first focuses on the validity of this livelihood paradox itself, all other hypotheses are formulated as genuine coping strategies. In order to address each of them, the present paper will rely on various (national) survey data, coming in total from about fifty thousand different households. IFPRI 3 WCAOPR 19 page...|$|R
40|$|Christianity {{can be a}} {{force for}} good in this world, but too many times Christians have used their {{religion}} as justification for the persecution of others. The apartheid regime in South Africa {{is a prime example}} of how Christians, specifically the people of the Dutch Reformed Church (DRC), used the Bible as a way to help create and support a system of oppression. In this paper, I explain how the DRC utilized Social Movement Framing to interpret the Bible in a way that supported the apartheid regime. I begin by laying out a brief history and explanation of Apartheid, followed by an explanation of the DRC’s role in the development and execution of apartheid. I then outline Social Movement Framing and the particular frames used by the DRC in order to mobilize support for apartheid. In the mid 1900 <b>s,</b> the <b>DRC</b> insisted that the government implement apartheid policy. The DRC then supported the implementation of the regime, despite organizations such as the World Council of Churches and the World Alliance of Reformed Churches intervening and accusing the DRC of heresy. The DRC was convinced that apartheid was a good and helpful solution for everyone. Even when it became clear that the DRC had been misinterpreting the Bible, they refused to adjust their position. Therefore, this paper explains how the DRC utilized social movement framing techniques to mobilize support for the apartheid regime and begins to address how Christians can avoid using such frames that lead to persecution in the future...|$|R

40|$|The {{economic}} potential for cassava a crop crucial for food security, especially in Africa remains largely untapped, despite constant growth in output. Nevertheless, {{a range of}} markets, including consumer, industrial, local and international, are important as this tuber strives to become competitive. Which crop grown in Africa produces {{twice as much as}} maize and three times as much as millet or sorghum? And which crop has seen Africa emerge as overall leader, accounting {{for more than half of}} the world output, with Nigeria as the biggest producer? Which same crop has seen production levels triple on the continent over the past 50 years? And now covers one-third of the dietary needs of its population? The answer is cassava. In the past few decades, this tuber has quietly taken over thousands of hectares and become the staple food of over 200 million Africans, or more than one-quarter of the continent s population. According to FAO figures, Africa produced 103 mt of cassava tubers on 18 million ha of land in 2004. This shrub, with its long stems and parasol-shaped leaves is now as common in Sahelian countries as it is in the more humid climes of Central Africa and the Gulf of Guinea, where it has traditionally thrived. Output varies greatly between regions, ranging from 1. 8 t/ha in Sudan to an average of 10. 6 t in Nigeria (which still falls way behind the yields achieved in the Caribbean: 16. 6 t in Barbados alone). Well established in countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which for a long time was Africa s leading producer, the crop has now spread to southern Africa (Malawi, Zambia) at the expense of maize. Here, where HIV/AIDs is killing many farmers, families are turning to crops which require less labour. Insuring against famine A number of other factors explain this rapid expansion, especially on smallholdings run by poor farmers, where cassava is often grown together with other crops. Cassava has the advantage of being relatively undemanding, and will thrive on poor and even tired soils, where few other crops will grow. In places where land is scarce, it also serves as food security for many villagers vulnerable to malnutrition. With cassava, they can be more confident of having a low-cost, plentiful supply of calories than they would have had they grown cereals. For farmers living close to towns, it is a valuable cash crop, with a flourishing market. In West Africa, its development has been further helped by the rapid expansion of towns and by an initiative launched by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), which has distributed new, more productive varieties that are resistant to a number of diseases as well as to drought. Cassava, fuel of the future? At a time when oil prices are soaring and global reserves dwindling, the spotlight is turning to ethanol made from fermented cassava starch, a particularly promising resource. Similar to other types of ethanol obtained from agricultural products, it can be used to substitute between 10 % and 25 % of petrol in vehicles with standard engines, and up to 100 % in vehicles whose engines have been adapted. Brazil, the world s leading producer of these substitute fuels or biofuels, makes more than 120 million hl per year from sugarcane and cassava. In Thailand and China, several projects for manufacturing cassava-based biofuel on an industrial scale are under way. In Africa, Nigeria is following suit and in early 2006, a law is expected to approve the use of 10 % biofuel in petrol, thereby cutting both the country s oil bill and pollution levels. In the short term, the fuel will be imported from Brazil, but in the longer term it will be manufactured locally. The flip side of the coin is that when this crop vitally important to a number of regions is hit by disease, the result is famine. That was seen all too clearly when the cassava mosaic virus devastated production in Uganda during the 1990 <b>s.</b> Burundi, <b>DRC</b> and Rwanda are currently grappling with the same disease and programmes to distribute resistant varieties are attempting to curtail the epidemic before it takes hold. This plant has long been neglected by research in favour of cereals, but its recent rapid success and its key role in feeding a number of regions go a long way towards explaining the renewed attention it is enjoying today. In partnership with the IITA, The New Partnership for Africa s Development (NEPAD) has launched the Pan-African Cassava Initiative to encourage projects based on the use of cassava as a food security crop and as a weapon against poverty. However, the economic importance of cassava is still disproportionately low given the major role it plays in agriculture and food supply. Once the hydrocyanic acid has been removed from the bitter varieties, the edible leaves are rich in protein and the tubers lend themselves to a wide range of preparations: chips, flour, semolina and cassava meal (gari, attiéké, foufou, chikwangue) to name a few. According to the IITA, close to one-third of all cassava is eaten fresh. The remainder needs to be processed quickly, as the tubers keep for barely 2 days under normal storage conditions. The Collaborative Study of Cassava in Africa (COSCA), conducted in the 1990 s, found that only 20 % of cassava-producing villages can be reached by motorised transport. Generally, farmers have to travel more than 10 km to take their heavy loads to market. In <b>DRC,</b> Africa <b>s</b> second largest producer, that is the case for seven out of ten villages. Long preparations Before cassava can be conserved and sold, it must first be processed. This task generally falls to women, who soak and grate it, then dry the roots. It is a long and tedious job, especially in rural areas where there are no machines, and the high input in terms of labour is not reflected in the often low price fetched by the finished product. Small businesses equipped with machinery are springing up in some towns, especially in countries around the Gulf of Guinea, and this encourages a steady flow of production from farmers in the outlying areas. COSCA has estimated that a mechanical grater cuts the processing time by half and therefore increases profits. In West Africa, the IITA has developed and distributed a number of machines, but they are still not sufficient, especially in the villages, to increase the commercial viability of a sector which in any case suffers from poor organisation. Beyond production Between 1996 and 2003, cassava production doubled to reach a total output of 3. 9 mt in Benin, while the per-ha yield increased by 25 %. This strong performance was largely the result of the government scheme a billion for cassava which offered credits, fertiliser and cuttings of improved varieties to producers in a bid to encourage them to increase production. But nothing was done to improve marketing at the same time. Poorly organised and lacking in processing equipment, the cassava sector proved unable to absorb the extra tonnes of cassava, and farmers found themselves forced to sell their crops off cheaply in some cases, they were unable to sell them at all. Exports of cassava chips to Europe for livestock fodder, have also been falling since 2002 as European farmers have turned to less costly cereal-based feed. In 2004, cassava production suddenly fell by half, with the result that the ethanol factory built by a Chinese group was unable to find enough raw material. Farmers say they are now ready to restart production if they can be assured of sales for their crop. But markets exist in the increasingly populated urban areas, as do technologies offering consumers cassava-based products that are easy to use. Good examples can be found in the Caribbean, the Pacific and South America, above all in Brazil, which has long been the world s leading cassava producer. Here, cassava is prepared in a host of different ways, often on an industrial scale, and the products chips, cakes, frozen dishes are sold in shops. In Brazil, one chain of stores sells cassava cheese bread. Cassava flour is used as a partial substitute for wheat flour to make traditional bread. In 2002, the Brazilian Congress even passed a law making it mandatory for bread to contain at least 20 % cassava flour and 40 % in the case of pizza. The idea was to reduce costly wheat imports and develop the commercial potential of local crops. Africa still lags way behind in this respect, though Nigerian bakers are now required to use 10 % of cassava flour in their bread (see Spore 117). A number of techniques developed in Latin America could be used in Africa. Colombian researchers have managed to extend the shelf-life of fresh cassava roots to 3 or 4 weeks by dipping them in wax or paraffin. Livestock fodder also offers interesting potential. In Africa, less than 2 % of cassava is used to feed animals, compared with 30 % in Latin America. In Cameroon, researchers estimate that poultry farmers could cut production costs by 40 % if they used cassava as part of their chickens diet. On a global scale, animal feed represents the main outlet for cassava. Thailand exports an annual 4 to 5 mt of it, mostly to the European Union. Finally, there are the many industrial uses to which this tuber lends itself. Starch, the main product to be made from cassava, is used in the food and textile industries as well as in the pharmaceutical and rubber sectors. In Africa, few companies make starch, and production does not even supply domestic needs. With the rise in oil prices, the manufacture of cassava-based ethanol, already widely used in Brazil to replace additives in petrol or as a biofuel, could constitute another interesting outlet. Multiple markets Market prospects for cassava have increased. But these have yet to be accessed by African farmers, some of whom have difficulty in selling their crops, as is the case in Benin where production has increased significantly. Large-scale production of food or industrial products requires a steady supply of good quality raw material. That is the first pre-condition, and Africa has yet to fulfil it since most of its cassava output is sold by large numbers of small-scale producers with no quality control whatsoever. The second requirement is that production costs be sufficiently attractive, for local as well as for international markets. Improving processing technologies is crucial if production costs are to fall significantly and both producers and processors are to earn enough income. On the world market, cassava starch faces competition from less costly maize starch. In 2002 for example, maize starch imported from Europe to Nigeria cost three times less than local cassava starch. While small groups of fairly well organised processors do exist, they are not always big enough to take advantage of economies of scale. What is more, cultivation and harvesting are still done entirely by hand. According to COSCA, this is partly explained by the considerable variation in size between one cassava plant and another, and between the size of their roots, which makes it difficult to mechanise crop cultivation. Major developments in both technologies and in organising markets are therefore essential if African cassava is to become competitive on local and international markets. When these conditions are met cassava will not only play a role in ensuring food security; it will also become a force for rural development. A just reward for producers who have worked so hard to expand production.
