40|$|Objective: To {{validate}} {{the usefulness of}} a diffusional anisotropic capillary array phantom and to investigate the effects of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameter changes on diffusion fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) using the phantom. Materials and Methods: Diffusion tensor imaging of a capillary array phantom was performed with imaging parameter changes, including voxel size, number of sensitivity encoding (<b>SENSE)</b> <b>factor,</b> echo time (TE), number of signal acquisitions, b-value, and number of diffusion gradient directions (NDGD), one-at-a-time in a stepwise-incremental fashion. We repeated the entire series of DTI scans thrice. The coefficients of variation (CoV) were evaluated for FA and ADC, and the correlation between each MR imaging parameter and the corresponding FA and ADC was evaluated using Spearman’s correlation analysis. Results: The capillary array phantom CoVs of FA and ADC were 7. 1 % and 2. 4 %, respectively. There were significant correlations between FA and <b>SENSE</b> <b>factor,</b> TE, b-value, and NDGD, as well as significant correlations between ADC and <b>SENSE</b> <b>factor,</b> TE, and b-value. Conclusion: A capillary array phantom enables repeated measurements of FA and ADC. Both FA and ADC can vary when certain parameters are changed during diffusion experiments.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-two patients treated with Guglielmi detachable coils for 54 cerebral aneurysms were evaluated at 3 T MRA. 3 D TOF MRA (TR/TE 23 / 3. 5; <b>SENSE</b> <b>factor</b> 2. 5) and CE-MRA by using a 3 D ultrafast gradient-echo sequence (TR/TE 5. 9 / 1. 8; <b>SENSE</b> <b>factor</b> 3) enhanced with 0. 1 -mmol/kg gadobenate dimeglumine were performed in the same session. Source images, 3 D maximum intensity projection, 3 D shaded surface display, and/or 3 D volume-rendered reconstructions were evaluated in terms of aneurysm occlusion/patency and artifact presence. RESULTS: In terms of clinical classification, the 2 MRA sequences were equivalent for 53 of the 54 treated aneurysms: 21 were considered fully occluded, whereas 16 were considered to have a residual neck and 16 were considered residually patent at follow-up MRA. The remaining aneurysm appeared fully occluded at TOF MRA but had a residual patent neck at CE-MRA. Visualization of residual aneurysm patency was significantly (P. 001) better with CE-MRA compared with TOF MRA for 10 (31. 3 %) of the 32 treated aneurysms considered residually patent with both sequences.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a 1. 5 T MRI scanner and prototype 18 -channel peripheral vascular (PV) coil designed for highly accelerated parallel imaging, geometry (g) -factor maps were determined. SNR-maximized protocols considering the two-dimensional sensitivity encoding (2 D <b>SENSE)</b> <b>factor,</b> TE, TR, bandwidth (BW), and flip angle (FA) were precalculated and stored. For each exam, a small aortic timing bolus was performed, followed by dynamic three-dimensional (3 D) -MRA of the calf. Using this information, the aorta to pedal artery and calf arteriovenous transit times were measured. This enabled estimation of the maximum upper and middle station acquisition duration to allow lower station acquisition to begin prior to venous arrival. The appropriately succinct SNR-optimized protocol for each station was selected and moving-table pCE-MRA was performed using thigh venous compression and high-relaxivity contrast material. RESULTS: The protocol was successfully applied in 15 patients and all imaging demonstrated good SNR without diagnosis-hindering venous enhancement.

This study investigates the effectiveness of reverse gradient susceptibility correction methods on spin echo (SE) and gradient echo (GE) EPI. In addition, the effects of varying bandwidth, <b>SENSE</b> <b>factor</b> and slice thickness on the corrected images were measured. Undistorted, anatomically accurate images are necessary in relating EPI images to anatomical MRI scans. This is particularly important for diffusion weighted imaging, perfusion imaging and fMRI. Due to the ever-increasing need for better temporal resolution with existing hardware, effective artefact correction in post-processing is necessary, as is appropriate sequence optimisation. This investigation was accomplished using normalised mutual information to compare the images pre and post correction to an anatomical image {{as a measure of}} anatomical accuracy.

It was found that, in most situations, the EPIC susceptibility correction tool was the most effective tool at correcting geometric distortions without the generation of new artefacts.

My research analyzes the terrain in which this question is precipitated, and I will evaluate stigma as a lens for understanding broader questions of politics and care that are embedded with American notions of self-hood. The national history of HIV/AIDS, Goffman’s work on stigma, and neoliberal policies, laws, and education measures have converged to create certain imaginations of attribution and individuality for those who live with the disease. People who are HIV-positive are feared, seen as immoral and tainted, and they are blamed for contracting the virus and failing to receive the proper care. The dominant discourse creates feelings of isolation and has led to beliefs that stigma is permanent and universally affects HIV/AIDS patients, so one must remain confidential about a diagnosis for protection from stigma. From policies that move towards privatized healthcare to the rationale that stigma can be localized to a body, these aspects of life rely on ideals of self-help and have precipitated perceptions of HIV/AIDS as solely individual experiences. Instead of seeking ways to confront these perceptions, society ultimately advocates for concealing diagnoses to mitigate stigma. The localization of stigma ignores the social construction of stigma that is informed by history, culture, and power, and in this very context, my participants have demonstrated agency by disclosing their stories. By illuminating social ties through dialogue, they have contested the dominant discourse that they are secluded from the rest due to their mark of stigma.

40|$|PURPOSE: Magnetic {{resonance}} diffusion-weighted imaging (MR-DWI) {{is useful}} to assess proton motion by the computation of an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). This property {{could be used to}} assess renal damage, with special regard to unilateral dysfunction. The aim {{of this study was to}} estimate the correlation between ADC and the stage of chronic renal failure (CRF) using a spin-echo echo-planar imaging (SE-EPI) sequence with the sensitivity encoding (SENSE) technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients (nine men and five women, mean age 49 years, range 22 - 66 years) underwent an MR examination on a 1. 5 -T system. Seven patients had a history of hypertension or CRF, one had Takayasu disease and one had nephrovascular hypertension. Five subjects without known kidney disease were used as controls. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) assessed by Cockcroft-Gault's equation was used as a functional marker. The imaging protocol consisted of T 1 - and T 2 -weighted sequences followed by a SE-EPI acquisition with a diffusion gradient of 600 s/mm(2) and <b>SENSE</b> <b>factor</b> 2 and pixel-by-pixel ADC map reconstruction. In five patients, the SE-EPI-DWI sequence was repeated after i. v. administration of 1 mg of furosemide. RESULTS: ADC was of 2. 44 +/- 0. 24 x 10 (- 3) mm(2) /s in patients with normal GFR and of 2. 05 +/- 0. 33 x 10 (- 3) mm(2) /s (p< 0. 05) in subjects with altered GFR; a significant difference was found between stage III and IV (p< 0. 01), whereas no differences were found between stage I and II (p= 0. 27) and between stage II and III (p= 0. 39). A good correlation was found between GFR and ADC (r= 0. 79; p< 0. 01), with no significant change after furosemide administration (p= 0. 7).

40|$|The {{study of}} blood flow is {{essential}} in understanding the physiology and pathophysiology of the cardiovascular system. Small disturbances of the blood flow may over time evolve and contribute to cardiovascular pathology. While the blood flow in a healthy human appears to be predominately laminar, turbulent or transitional blood flow {{is thought to be}} involved in the pathogenesis of several cardiovascular diseases. Wall shear stress is the frictional force of blood on the vessel wall and has been linked to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and aneurysms. Despite the importance of hemodynamic factors, cardiovascular diagnostics largely relies on the indirect estimation of function based on morphological data. Time-resolved three-dimensional (3 D) phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), often referred to as 4 D flow MRI, is a versatile and non-invasive tool for cardiovascular blood flow assessment. The use of 4 D flow MRI permits estimation of flow volumes, pressure losses, wall shear stress, turbulence intensity and many other unique hemodynamic parameters. However, 4 D flow MRI suffers from long scan times, sometimes over 40 minutes. Furthermore, the accuracy of the many different 4 D flow MRI-based applications and estimates have not been thoroughly examined. In this thesis, the accuracy of 4 D flow MRI-based turbulence intensity mapping and wall shear stress estimation was investigated by using numerical simulations of MRI flow measurements. While the results from the turbulence intensity mapping agreed well with reference values from computational fluid dynamics data, the accuracy of the MRI-based wall shear stress estimates was found to be very sensitive to different parameters, especially to spatial resolution, and wall shear stress values over 5 N/m 2 were not well resolved. To reduce the scan time, a 4 D flow MRI sequence using spiral k-space trajectories was implemented and validated in-vivo and in-vitro. The scan time of 4 D flow MRI was reduced by more than two-fold compared to a conventional Cartesian acquisition already accelerated using <b>SENSE</b> <b>factor</b> 2, and the data quality was maintained. For a 4 D flow scan of the human heart, the use of spiral k-space trajectories resulted in a scan time of around 13 min, compared to 30 min for the Cartesian acquisition. By combining parallel imaging and spiral trajectories, the total scan time of a 4 D flow measurement of the entire heart may be further reduced. This scan time reduction may also be traded for higher spatial resolution. Numerical simulation of 4 D flow MRI may act as an important tool for future optimization and validation of the spiral 4 D flow sequence. The scan-time reductions offered by the spiral k-space trajectories can help to cut costs, save time, reduce discomfort for the patient as well as to decrease the risk for motion artifacts. These benefits may facilitate an expanded clinical and investigative use of 4 D flow MRI, including larger patient research studies...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} is to study as a model the gelation phase transition of agarose solutions with transverse relaxation (T 2) quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI). The {{focus is on the}} reduction of T 2 of agarose solution upon gelation. The sol-to-gel phase transition of agarose may provide a useful and controllable experimental model of tissue formation. Furthermore, it may provide the basis for exact mathematical models useful for understanding the much reduced transverse relaxation times (T 2) observed in solid tissues relative to simple liquids. In this context, the {{purpose of this}} work was to monitor dynamically with T 2 quantitative MRI the liquid-to-gel phase transition of pure agarose as a function of gel concentration. Samples of agarose at various concentrations were allowed to cool down while scanning dynamically with T 2 qMRI, 32 x 10 milliseconds (ms) echoes, CarrPurcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG), 3 Tesla. T 2 versus; (temperature). curves of each agarose solution show a distinct phase transition region characterized by a sharp T 2 reduction. Four agarose solutions were sequentially prepared by dissolving agarose powder in distilled water at concentrations of 1 %, 2 %, 3 %, and 4 % by weight/volume. Immediately after preparation and boiling at 98 °C, each liquid agarose solution was poured into a plastic container and scanned dynamically at 3. 0 T as it cooled down with a whole body MRI scanner (Achieva, Philips Medical Systems, Cleveland, OH). A single axial slice multi spin echo CPMG pulse sequence with the following parameters was used: 32 echoes, 10 ms echo spacing, 1. 5 s repetition time (TR), 160 x 160 matrix size, and 2 <b>SENSE</b> <b>factor.</b> The time per dynamic scan was 1 minute. The DICOM images were further processed with an adaptive T 2 qMRI algorithm programed in Mathcad (Parametric Technology Corporation, Needham, MA) whereby the number of echoes used in the semi-logarithmic linear regression varies automatically from pixel to pixel depending on noise level. The T 2 values of agarose gels have been measured during the entire gelation phase transition process at four different concentrations. The T 2 versus time (temperature) curves of all the four concentrations shows a rapid drop at about 24 minutes (T~ 40 °C) at which time the gelation phase transition begins. At all temperatures, T 2 decreases as a function of increasing agarose concentration. The data shows similar behaviors for all concentrations with a phase transition characterized by a drastic drop in T 2 occurring while the temperature drops by approximately 8 °C. These results may be useful for testing theoretical models of the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) T 2 relaxation properties during tissue formation. Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) differs sharply from conventional directly acquired MRI in that objective measures [such as the trio of the basis MR properties: longitudinal relaxation (T 1), T 2 and Proton Density (PD) ] are used for analysis as well as further post-processing rather than relative signal intensities.

40|$|In {{the late}} 1970 s, during a program set to {{identify}} potential mitogenic components of serum, thrombin {{was shown to}} be a powerful mitogen for fibroblasts and to induce fibroblast migration in wound scratch assays via a direct mechanism requiring thrombin’s catalytic activity and involving receptor activation. The quandary as to how coagulation factors influenced cellular responses, which was suspected since the observation of Trousseau and the eponym syndrome, was elucidated by the identification of the thrombin receptor PAR- 1 in 1991. PAR- 1 represented the first member of a fundamentally unique subclass within the seven transmembrane domain protein superfamily, as receptors in this subclass are activated by proteolytic cleavage. At the approximately the same time the structural homology of tissue factor (TF) with the class 2 cytokine receptor superfamily led to the hypothesis that binding of FVIIa to TF would induce intracellular signaling as well. Indeed, FVIIa binding to TF triggers signaling pathways. The interaction of FVIIa with TF is essential for signaling as the binding induces a major structural change in the serine protease domain allowing its full activity. Interestingly, TF/FVIIa signaling appears to be mediated via PAR- 2 activation, reuniting the different components of the coagulation signaling-associated plasma membrane-localized components. Over the last decade, a plethora of studies established the pleiotropic role of FVIIa and thrombin in health and disease (e. g. inflammation, cancer, angiogenesis, but also wound healing and bone development for thrombin. However, as an intermediate in the coagulation cascade, FXa has long been considered a passive bystander only, and consequently its role in cell biology remained relatively unexplored. It is now clear that FXa plays a crucial non-haemostatic role. Thus, it has become clear that vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors in general and factor X in particular are principal players in pathophysiology. Hence understanding its biology better as well as its role in pathophysiology my provide exiting insights in both the understanding of human and animal physiology in general and provide clues to improved therapy in particular. In thesis I explore the biology of factor X and its associated signaling components, in particular factor VII. To this end, following a literature study on the molecular genetics and pathophysiology of coagulation FVII and FX inherited deficiencies (chapter 2), I start in the nucleus with a study on the regulation of splice site selection in the FVII gene as its intron 7 provides an excellent for such a study, with repetition of the intron 7 splice donor site (chapter 3). Next, I investigate the effects of coagulation FVIIa and FXa on signaling and their functional consequences on cell biology. Subsequently it turned out that factor VII is a relatively minor player in pathophysiology (chapter 4) and its downstream target, factor X (which acts as the point of convergence of the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of coagulation; chapter 5) should actually be the focus point of relevant research. Hence, I decided to mainly explore factor X biology, firstly addressing of this signalling to cell survival (of obvious relevance for cancer cell biology; chapter 6) and migration (chapter 7) and this notion was confirmed in detailed comparisons of the biochemical changes induced by the three major vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors (chapter 8). It appeared, however, that the effects in the clinically highly relevant –but underexplored- phenomenon of fibrosis were a more rewarding of research and the research of these efforts are described in the remaining chapters. Finally I conclude that factor X is essential mediator of tissue repair, whose inappropriate activation may lead to fibrotic responses. In this <b>sense,</b> <b>factor</b> X as a passive mediator of coagulation has been hijacked by the body to mediate repair. ...|$|E
40|$|We are {{developing}} web-based software to provide diffusion MRI-derived in vivo {{information about the}} connections between cortical regions in human and animal subjects, and present {{the latest version of}} our software, piconmat. com version 2. 0. By measuring the diffusivity of water along white matter fibre bundles, diffusion MRI and probabilistic tractography allow in vivo inferences to be made about the presence of connections between regions of the brain 1. Tractography results are useful to a range of communities, from those working in MR, through biologists, psychologists and physicians. However, tractography requires access to MR scanning facilities, and the use of appropriate MR sequences and tractography software. To answer many questions of interest it is necessary to characterise connectivity with respect to a population of subjects and across species. For many investigators, such experiments are impractical. One approach is to provide anatomical connection information online, e. g., the CoCoMac database summarises over 400 literature reports on invasive tracer experiments on macaques 2. These methods are an accepted gold standard, but cannot be used in humans. In vivo HARDI-based approaches do not suffer from this drawback. Fig. 1 illustrates a typical tractography result. Version 2. 0 of piconmat. com improves substantially upon the previous version that debuted at the 2009 ISMRM meeting. WEB-BASED INTERFACE Conventionally, the strength of connection between all pairs of cortical regions is represented as a symmetrical matrix, which can be visualised as a colour-coded array plot. Our software is based around an interactive connection matrix (Fig. 2), which displays the mean connection strengths between all pairs of regions, where the averaging is performed over all individuals in the piconmat. com dataset that meet certain criteria. As the user moves the mouse across the connection matrix, a display is updated to show information about the corresponding region pair; this includes: the names of the regions, the mean connection strength, and a coarse histogram of the distribution of strengths. The information about a region pair can be added to a list by clicking on that region pair’s matrix element. Associated with each individual is certain metadata (e. g., age, sex, handedness). Controls are provided to allow the user to include or exclude individuals {{on the basis of these}} characteristics; the connection matrix and list of selected regions update to reflect changes in the set of individuals of interest. Multiple connection matrices can be simply added to the page, such that visual comparisons of the connection strengths between groups—e. g., males and females aged 25 – 50 —can be made. Finally, once information about interesting region pairs has been selected, the underlying data can be obtained in a format that can be copied and pasted into Excel or statistics software for further analysis. ACQUISITION TRACKING For the human brain data held at piconmat. com, high angular resolution diffusion data were acquired in human volunteers on a 3 T Philips Achieva scanner using an 8 -element head coil. PGSE EPI with TE= 59 ms, cardiac gating, Gmax= 62 mT/m, partial Fourier factor 0. 679, 112 × 112 matrix reconstructed to 128 × 128, reconstructed resolution 1. 875 × 1. 875 mm 2, slice thickness 2. 1 mm, 60 contiguous slices, 61 directions at b= 1200 s/mm 2, 1 at b= 0, <b>SENSE</b> <b>factor</b> = 2. 5, correction for susceptibility and eddy current-induced distortion 3. Tractography connection maps were produced between the aparc+aseg regions defined by FreeSurfer 4, 5, using the multi-fibre Probabilistic Index of Connectivity (PICo) method 6. At each voxel, diffusion probability density functions—generated using constrained spherical deconvolution and a model-based residual bootstrapping method 7, 8 —describe fibre bundle orientation uncertainty. We used 1000 streamlines and a step size of 0. 5 mm. Streamlines were terminated on doubling back or on leaving the brain volume. A voxel’s connection is defined as the proportion of all streamlines that pass through it. DISCUSSION CONCLUSIONS We have outlined a significant enhancement to previously reported software, piconmat. com, which we have made publicly available at no cost, as a service to the scientific community. The software uses standard web technologies (HTTP, XHTML, CSS and JavaScript) and requires a highperformance modern browser such as Mozilla Firefox v 3. 5, Apple Safari v 4, Opera v 10 or Google Chrome v 3. Future work will include improving performance under Microsoft Internet Explorer, the addition of more connection data, and releasing the source code under an open source license.

40|$|A density <b>sensing</b> <b>factor</b> {{has been}} {{isolated}} from Dictyostelium discoideum {{and is known}} as conditioned media factor (CMF). CMF {{has been shown to}} cause starved vegetative Dictyostelium cells to differentiate into one of two cell types, stalk or spore cells. One interesting aspect of CMF concerns its release: CMF mRNA is present in vegetative Dictyostelium cells, yet secretion of the CMF protein only occurs during early and late development. My research reveals evidence that CMF is sequestered in the plasma membrane of vegetative cells. Further experiments show that CMF anti-sense transformants are motile but do not form cell aggregates. I suggest that CMF may have a role in chemotaxis which could involve interactions with components of the cytoskeleton. I have identified a few cytoskeletal components in vegetative and developing Dictyostelium cells which may provide useful information concerning the developmental process...|$|R
40|$|AbstractConstitutive {{inhibition}} of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) in Dictyostelium cells blocks cell aggregation and development. We investigated {{the cause of}} the aggregation defect in transformants overexpressing dominant-negative PKA regulatory subunits (PKA-RM) under an actin 15 promoter. These mutants could not relay pulses of the chemoattractant cAMP, due to a defect in expression of the aggregative adenylyl cyclase (ACA) gene. Unstimulated and cAMP pulse-induced expression of other aggregative genes encoding the cAMP receptor cAR 1, adhesive contact sites A and cAMP-phosphodiesterase were also strongly reduced in the mutants. Additionally, the expression of the discoidin I gene, that is expressed early in development in response to cell density <b>sensing</b> <b>factors,</b> was almost completely absent. These data are in interesting contrast with observations that cAMP relay and aggregative gene expression are normal in null mutants for the PKA catalytic (C) subunit and suggest the presence of multiple C subunit genes in Dictyostelium and an almost universal requirement for PKA activity in developmental gene expression...|$|R
