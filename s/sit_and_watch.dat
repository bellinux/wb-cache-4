5|$|Margret Reed {{had managed}} to save enough food for a Christmas pot of soup, {{to the delight of}} her children, but by January they were facing {{starvation}} and considered eating the oxhides that served as their roof. Margret Reed, Virginia, Milt Elliott, and the servant girl Eliza Williams attempted to walk out, reasoning {{that it would be better}} to try to bring food back than <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> the children starve. They were gone for four days in the snow before they had to turn back. Their cabin was now uninhabitable; the oxhide-roof served as their food supply, and the family moved in with the Breens. The servants went to live with other families. One day, the Graveses came by to collect on the debt owed by the Reeds and took the oxhides, all that the family had to eat.|$|E
500|$|The ski jumping, {{cross-country}} skiing and Nordic combined events {{were held at}} Holmenkollbakken, [...] from the city center. Although upgraded several times since its opening in 1892, the former wooden superstructure was replaced with a concrete tower and in-run ahead of the Olympics, with the out-run being extended to [...] Stands were erected to seat 13,000 people, with capacity for an additional 130,000 standing spectators {{at the base of}} the hill. Cross-country races started and ended {{at the base of the}} ski hill. A switchboard was posted at the start and finish lines to help spectators monitor the progress of the competitors during the races. Most of the stands built for the ski jumping competition had to be removed for the cross-country races. As a result, there was little room for spectators to <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> the cross-country events. Spectators were therefore allowed to walk within the course.|$|E
500|$|Owing to {{the scale}} of the atrocities, US embassy staff had sent telegrams {{indicating}} that a genocide was occurring. One, which became known as the Blood telegram, was sent by Archer Blood, the US Consul General in Dhaka, and was signed by him as well as US officials from USAID and USIS who at the time were serving in Dhaka. In it, the signatories denounced American [...] "complicity in Genocide". In an interview in 1972, Indira Gandhi, the Indian prime minister, justified the use of military intervention, saying, [...] "Shall we <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> their women get raped?" [...] The events were discussed extensively in the British House of Commons. John Stonehouse proposed a motion supported by a further 200 members of parliament condemning the atrocities being carried out by the Pakistani armed forces. Although this motion was presented twice before parliament, the government did not find time to debate it.|$|E

500|$|In 2013, Paul {{established}} the [...] "Ron Paul Channel", an Internet broadcast. Its slogan is [...] "Turn Off Your TV. Turn On the Truth." [...] Speaking about the channel, Paul said, [...] "I {{was at a}} debate one time a couple years ago, where I didn't think I got a fair shake. In a two-hour debate, I had 89 seconds. I thought, maybe there's {{something wrong with the}} media. Maybe they're not covering us fairly. I'm just using it as a pun, but there’s a bit of truth to this. We don't get a fair shake. The people who believe in liberty and limited government don't expect it from the ordinary media." [...] Speaking about his youth appeal, he noted, [...] "They don’t <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> TV and turn the programs on at seven o'clock to watch us like that – so I thought the technology was there. The country is ripe for the continuation of this revolution." ...|$|E
500|$|At the 2009 NHL General Managers' Meeting, it was {{discussed}} whether the rule should be eliminated {{as a solution}} to the increasing number of injuries on defenseman who were being hit hard by forechecking forwards. The forecheckers were no longer impeded by defencemen holding them up because of the crackdown on interference, which created situations where defencemen were being hit at high speeds. Brodeur believed that revoking the trapezoid could result in more scoring and more exciting games. He explained, [...] "If you give the liberty to the goalies to play the puck, they'll mess up more than they're successful." [...] He also expressed his concern for defencemen, [...] "It's a no-brainer if they want to start to eliminate these huge hits for the defencemen... Whenever my defencemen or somebody was getting a big hit, I felt guilty that I let that guy get hit like that. Now, I've got to <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> all the time... You've got to try to find something because so many guys are getting hurt." [...] At the time of his statement, Devils defencemen Paul Martin, Johnny Oduya and Bryce Salvador were all out with injuries.|$|E
500|$|PhilipIV's first wife, Elizabeth of France, died in 1644; {{and their}} only son, Balthasar Charles, {{died two years}} later. Lacking an heir, Philip married Mariana of Austria in 1649, and Margaret Theresa (1651–1673) was their first child, and their only one {{at the time of}} the painting. Subsequently, she had a {{short-lived}} brother Philip Prospero (1657–1661), and then Charles (1661–1700) arrived, who succeeded to the throne as CharlesII at the age of three. Velázquez painted portraits of Mariana and her children, and although Philip himself resisted being portrayed in his old age he did allow Velázquez to include him in Las Meninas. In the early 1650s he gave Velázquez the Pieza Principal ("main room") of the late Balthasar Charles's living quarters, by then serving as the palace museum, to use as his studio. It is here that Las Meninas is set. Philip had his own chair in the studio and would often <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> Velázquez at work. Although constrained by rigid etiquette, the art-loving king seems to have had an unusually close relationship with the painter. After Velázquez's death, Philip wrote [...] "I am crushed" [...] in the margin of a memorandum on the choice of his successor.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first single}} from {{the album was}} the dance track [...] "I Can See Clearly", which reached no.23 in the UK.

500|$|Some {{critics have}} commended {{the show for}} its {{widespread}} appeal, while others have argued the opposite and criticized it for catering solely to preschoolers. In an interview with The New York Times, Tom Ascheim said that [...] "the show's quirky appeal extended far beyond Noggin's target audience. 'The simplicity is really understandable by my two-year-old, but my ten-year-old really giggles at Oobi. Andrew Dalton of The Stir stated {{that he was a}} fan of the show himself, adding that Oobi is [...] "just happy to be simple and gleeful, and that actually makes it more appealing to <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> as a grown-up." [...] The San Diego Union-Tribunes Jane Clifford felt that it could be enjoyed by viewers of all ages, remarking that [...] "if as a kid you ever drew eyes or a mouth on your hand and then 'talked' to a friend, you'll relate to this show." [...] Oppositely, Rebecca Brayton of WatchMojo.com felt that while Oobi [...] "had the intentions to build academic skills in children ... it left their parents empty-handed." [...] Evan Levine of The Star Democrat stated in his review that [...] "it is certainly fun for preschoolers {{to be able to make}} their own Oobis, and they’ll no doubt relate to some of the issues discussed … parents, however, may find that the show wears thin quickly and feels a little forced." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the timing}} of {{introducing}} the new characters, the showrunners decided to introduce the Punisher immediately and hold back on Elektra briefly, with Ramirez explaining that [...] "one of the pitfalls when we have this many great characters to play with is wanting to throw them at the wall", but {{it was important to}} take the time to introduce the new characters properly to the audience, particularly to the people who weren't already familiar with them. Elaborating on the aim to keep the story focused on Murdock, Petrie revealed that the writers would often come up with [...] "amazing stuff" [...] for the season, but then realize that they had forgotten about Murdock and had to [...] "completely turn it over and look at how this affects Matt and filter it through that prism." [...] Ramirez added,It could easily become The Punisher story or the Elektra story that Matt cameos in, and not vice versa. So, we built it like a Matt story, in terms of what we wanted to put him through, where we wanted to get him, by the end of the season, and what we wanted to have him learn about himself, and we used an Elektra and Frank story throughout, to get him there... we talked about when we watch shows in 13 episode stretches, how do we watch them? What is an exciting structure that we would like to think about here? Do we divide it right down the middle? Do we do a three-act structure?...If you were to <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> 13 episodes, you would absolutely feel a structure, much like in the comics. That’s what we did this season.|$|E

2500|$|One of his hits, in the 1865 Surrey-Middlesex {{match at}} Islington, was {{measured}} {{and found to}} be 119 yards. 34 years later, it was recalled: [...] "A good deal was made {{of it in the}} reports at the time, but although, of course, it wasn't nearly equal to many of Thornton's best, I think in the present day you might <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> cricket for a long time without seeing a hit as good." ...|$|E

[...] Asked for an example, the Doctor replies [...] "You know the Golden Rule of the Time Lords – just to <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> <b>watch</b> but never actually do anything? He and I are different.

Kath encouraged Sharon to chase her roots in the last season, which led her to meet her obnoxious (almost Kim's reflection) half sister Karen (played by Matt Lucas).
