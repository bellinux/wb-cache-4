In case of interference in the selected frequency channel, the mobile terminal (possibly from suggestion by the base station) can initiate either intracell handover, selecting another channel/transmitter on the same base, or intercell handover, selecting a different base station altogether. For this purpose, DECT devices scan all idle channels at regular 30 s intervals to generate a RSSI (Received <b>Signal</b> <b>Strength</b> <b>Indication)</b> list.

Without loss of generality, we consider that the user has an RFID reader and that he has to locate himself based solely on it and on the coordinates of RFID tags nearby (this RFID reader is not used to measure distances), where each tag is attached to a point with a known location (this is known as a handset-based approach). It should be clear that there are not time, angles, received <b>signal</b> <b>strength</b> <b>indications</b> (RSSI) or any other quantities being measured.

What is more, the RFID-based approach proposed in this article is independent from other location technologies and it might locate emergency calls in real time using the pre-existing lamp-posts and indoor lamps structure. This greatly diminishes the implementation’s labor, which comprises the measurement of each RFID tag coordinates and their individual installation—analogous to the installation of lamps over the streets and indoors. It also simplifies the tags periodic replacement, as it is likely that unified operations to simultaneously replace lamps and RFID tags will be feasible. And there is more, the energy supply of the lamps could serve as the tags main power, dismissing the use of batteries and allowing a continuous transmission of the signals along the great ranges required by this approach.|$|R

40|$|The {{accurate}} localization of end-users {{and resources}} {{is seen as}} one of the main pillars toward the successful implementation of context-based applications. While current outdoor localization mechanisms fulfill most application requirements, the design of accurate indoor localization mechanisms is still an open issue. Most research efforts are focusing on the design of mechanisms making use of the receiver <b>signal</b> <b>strength</b> <b>indications</b> generated by WLAN (wireless local area network) devices. However, the accuracy and robustness of such mechanisms can be severely compromised due to the random and unpredictable nature of radio channels. In this article, we develop a methodology incorporating various algorithms capable of coping with the unpredictable nature of radio channels. Following a holistic approach, we start by identifying the wireless equipment parameter setting, better meeting the implementation requirements of a robust indoor localization mechanism. We then make use of RANdom SAmple Consensus paradigm: a robust model-fitting mechanism capable of smoothing the data captured during the space survey.

40|$|Most {{existing}} indoor localization algorithms {{based on}} Wi-Fi signals mainly rely on wireless access points (APs), i. e. hotspots, with fixed deployment, which are easily {{affected by the}} non-line of sight (NLOS) factors and the multipath effect. There also exist many other problems, such as positioning stability and blind spots, which can cause decline in positioning accuracy at certain positions, or even failure of positioning. However, it will increase the hardware cost by adding more static APs; if the localization mechanism integrates different wireless signals is adopted, it tends to cause high cost of positioning and long complex positioning process, etc. In this paper, we proposed a novel hybrid Wi-Fi access point-based localization algorithm (HAPLA), which utilizes the received <b>signal</b> <b>strength</b> <b>indications</b> (RSSI) from static APs and dynamic APs to determine location scenes. It flexibly selects available AP signals and dynamically switches the positioning methods, thus to achieve efficient positioning.

The proposed method can also be able to effectively prevent interference from different signal sources. In our test scenario, we deployed typical indoor scenes with the NLOS factors and the multipath effect for experiments. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method and the results show that, compared with the classic K nearest neighbor-based location algorithm (KNN) and the variance-based fingerprint distance adjustment algorithm (VFDA), HAPLA has better adaptability and higher positioning accuracy, and can effectively solve the problem of positioning blind spots...|$|R

40|$|Large {{industrial}} boilers {{continue to}} grow in size. In the largest ones, the measurement systems no longer reach the inner parts of the combustion chambers. In addition, new measurement solutions are needed due to tightened regulations, new technology and use of renewable energy sources, such as biofuels. To measure in the inner parts of combustion chambers and to find new measurement methods, sensor ball propagating inside the combustion chamber was invented and patented. This research focused on the challenges {{in the implementation of}} such a sensor ball. There are many technological issues to be solved before final use of the sensor ball. They concern communication possibilities inside the combustion chamber, the hovering of the sensor ball in different types of combustion, and the operating time of sensor balls in harsh environments such as combustion chambers and flames. The preliminary research done and documented in this thesis concerns the following questions: What is the attenuation of radio and microwave signals inside the combustion chamber? What kind of electromagnetic noise is present in the chamber? What could be the operation time of a sensor in flames and what are the conditions for the hovering and propagation of the sensor ball inside the combustion chamber? Important issues such as receiving antennas, positioning of the sensor ball and feasible measurement solutions, which, can be interlinked with this kind of sensor, are mainly excluded from the study {{due to a lack of}} time and a need to limit the topic area. The investigations done by calculations, modelling, simulations, and practical tests, yielded a number of results. First, the operation time of sensors balls in the boilers can be minutes. However, if the enclosure of the sensor ball is made from very good thermal insulation and the dissipation power of sensor electronics is not limited, the sensor can be destroyed more likely due to self-heating than an external high temperature. In addition, wires through the enclosure to sensor electronics can dramatically shorten the operation time of a thermally well-protected sensor. The hovering and free propagation of the sensor ball is possible in CFB boilers. If an operation time of about tens of seconds can be seen adequate, the sensor ball can also hover in many other types of boilers having adequate upward flows and suspension densities. Further, it was stated that communication is possible in the combustion environments, but demands special solutions. The main limitations to the communication are noise for wideband communication systems and attenuation for all wireless systems. It was theoretically observed that at least in the combustion area of a kraft recovery boiler there exists weak plasma due to strong ionization originating obviously from alkaline. As a preliminary result, it was seen that due to the effects of flames and ionization on the radio and microwave signals, the positioning methods and techniques, which are based on flight times and <b>signal</b> <b>strength</b> <b>indications,</b> do not suit the mobile sensor operating in the combustion area. In the combustion area, the sensor must position itself.
