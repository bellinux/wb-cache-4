5|$|Friday Night Lights {{is unusual}} for using actual {{locations}} rather than stage sets and <b>sound</b> <b>stage.</b> These factors together with reliance on filming hundreds of locals as extras, gives the series an authentic feel and look.|$|E
5|$|The Blackbird was {{redesigned}} {{and increased}} in virtual size from 60 feet to 85 feet. John Myhre {{served as the}} production designer on the first film, but Singer hired Guy Hendrix Dyas for X2, which was his first film as a production designer. For scenes involving Stryker's Alkali Base, Vancouver Film Studios, the largest <b>sound</b> <b>stage</b> in North America, was reserved.|$|E
50|$|In March 2012, Mayor Michael Bloomberg {{unveiled}} {{five new}} <b>sound</b> <b>stages</b> (a total of 30500 sq ft) at Steiner Studios. The new <b>sound</b> <b>stages</b> all feature {{two or three}} wall cycloramas.|$|R
50|$|In an {{adjoining}} building {{there are also}} two <b>sound</b> <b>stages</b> which are used for dramas, soaps etc. such as RTÉ's flagship soap Fair City, and the award winning drama Love/Hate. The <b>sound</b> <b>stages</b> are named A and B and both measure 5865 sq ft.|$|R

5|$|After {{listening}} to the song, Barber was inspired to create a video around the Beatles' appearance on Sullivan's show based on the song's musical structure, but André 3000 had never seen this footage. Barber showed the footage to André 3000 {{and came up with}} the idea of reversing the British Invasion, by having the American band the Love Below becoming popular on a British television program. The music video was filmed in two days in August 2003 on a <b>sound</b> <b>stage</b> at Universal Studios in Los Angeles, California.|$|E
5|$|Aronofsky {{originally}} planned to direct The Fountain on a $70 million budget with Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett {{in the lead}} roles, but Pitt's withdrawal and cost overruns led Warner Bros. to shut down his production. The director rewrote the script to be sparser, {{and was able to}} resurrect the film with a $35 million budget with Jackman and Weisz in the lead roles. Production mainly took place on a <b>sound</b> <b>stage</b> in Montreal, Quebec, and the director used macro photography to create key visual effects for The Fountain at a low cost.|$|E
5|$|The Blood Beast alien costume {{was also}} {{previously}} {{used in the}} Roger Corman film Teenage Caveman (1958), which was filmed just two weeks earlier. Art director Daniel Haller, who built the rocket-ship and other props, slept at the <b>sound</b> <b>stage</b> between work sessions. Following dissatisfaction with his treatment by the Cormans, Varno pursued two successful arbitration cases, {{one of which was}} for underpayment. The other was in response to Gene Corman's original story writing credit, even though Varno claimed to have written the entire story himself.|$|E

5000|$|Because war {{restrictions}} did {{not permit}} filming at sea, the film was shot entirely on Warner Brothers studio <b>sound</b> <b>stages</b> and back lots. According to Bill Collins Presents the Golden Years of Hollywood, the ships sets were built in halves on two <b>sound</b> <b>stages,</b> with the tanker sinking sequence shot first on the studio's [...] "Stage Nine".|$|R
5|$|The ESL {{is renowned}} for sonic {{transparency}} and very low distortion. Its midrange performance is usually described in superlative terms, common to other electrostatic designs. Its sound is tonally neutral, exceptionally spacious, and transient response very fast. A properly configured stereo pair would generate {{a very small}} 'sweet spot' where the <b>sound</b> <b>stage</b> snaps into focus. This led to criticisms of the speaker's directionality which in practice was rarely a problem and {{had the benefit of}} reducing the effects of room resonances.|$|E
5|$|The missile silo {{used for}} the episode's climactic scene was {{incomplete}} when the scene was filmed, as the crew {{did not have enough}} time or money left to complete the set. The crew built the incomplete silo on a <b>sound</b> <b>stage</b> around a completed spacecraft prop, and were able to digitally extend the set with computer generated interiors to give the impression of a much larger silo. Exterior shots of the silo building were also enhanced digitally, with various buildings and machinery created with computer generated imagery and composited into the exterior shots.|$|E
5|$|Fast {{transient}} response and low distortion are both characteristic of electrostatics. The driver, being only 0.00137-inch thick and weighing only 3mg, is thus capable of stopping and starting seemingly instantaneously with no damping {{necessary to the}} drive units. However, the design also limits bandwidth to between 40Hz and 10kHz. Kohli of TNT noted that upper register starts to taper above 10kHz and then falls off severely beyond 13kHz, and is 15-20dB down at 20kHz. The speaker's design makes them extremely directional, and the general practice is to toe in the speakers to point directly to the listener. Although a slight deviation {{did not seem to}} make a difference, it is in practice not possible for more than one person to enjoy a reasonably balanced <b>sound</b> <b>stage</b> with the ESL.|$|E

5|$|Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel is a {{situation}} comedy radio show starring two of the Marx Brothers, Groucho and Chico, and written primarily by Nat Perrin and Arthur Sheekman. The series was originally broadcast in the United States on the National Broadcasting Company's Blue Network beginning November 28, 1932, and ended May 22, 1933. Sponsored by the Standard Oil Companies of New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Louisiana and the Colonial Beacon Oil Company, it was the Monday night installment of the Five-Star Theater, an old-time radio variety series that offered a different program each weeknight. Episodes were broadcast live from NBC's WJZ station in New York City and later from a <b>sound</b> <b>stage</b> at RKO Pictures in Los Angeles, California, before returning to WJZ for the final episodes.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Sharman {{reunited with}} O'Brien to do Shock Treatment, a {{stand-alone}} feature {{that was not}} a direct sequel to the original film. This film reunites characters Brad and Janet and was originally conceived and written to depict the characters filmed in normal settings until the production changed to work around a Screen Actor's Guild strike. The eventual production would now entail the full film being shot entirely within a <b>sound</b> <b>stage</b> and purposely blending that into the story line. Shock Treatment has a cult following but not nearly as strong as the first film, and was a commercial failure in no small part due to the principal cast of Curry, Sarandon and Bostwick not returning.|$|E
5|$|Principal filming {{took place}} in Vancouver, British Columbia, with the crash scene being filmed on an old airport space with flat roads. However, other key {{sequences}} occurred in the studio. Because the fight scene between the Winchesters and Azazel at the climax was meant {{to take place in}} a secluded, forest-enclosed cabin, production built the set on a <b>sound</b> <b>stage.</b> Production designer Jerry Wanek felt the set was extremely important, as viewers would become uninterested if the forest looked fake. With Morgan rendered blind by the yellow contact lenses required to depict his character's demonic possession, the production crew placed sandbags on the floor to help the actor locate his marks.|$|E
50|$|Metro Orlando {{alone is}} {{home to more than}} 10 {{state-of-the-art}} <b>sound</b> <b>stages,</b> {{making it one of the}} largest working production facility centers outside of Los Angeles and New York. Complete studio and production services are available throughout Florida, including backlots that can double for just about any national or international locale, production office space and <b>sound</b> <b>stages</b> totaling more than 160000 sq ft.|$|R
50|$|The final {{six weeks}} of {{production}} moved operations to Ren-Mar Studios in Hollywood where two floors of {{the interior of the}} Monrovia house were recreated on <b>sound</b> <b>stages.</b> This included sets for the living room, staircase, den and three upstairs bedrooms. On a separate adjacent set the jungle exteriors for the Vietnam flash-back scenes were also built on <b>sound</b> <b>stages,</b> taking three days to put together.|$|R

5|$|Principal {{photography}} for {{the pilot}} took place in Los Angeles, though subsequent episodes of the series are filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia to save money. The bridge sequences were shot at Lake Piru, near a War of the Worlds filming location, and the library and phone booth scenes were filmed at an elementary school. Triplet babies portrayed Sam in the episode's teaser, and production {{found it difficult to}} get them to cry on cue. Though a real house served as the first-story level in the teaser, the upstairs was constructed on a <b>sound</b> <b>stage</b> because of the special effects required for Mary's fiery death. Script rewrites for the opening sequence—a better introduction for Sam was needed—required reshoots on the set of The O.C. two months after principal photography.|$|E
5|$|Several of the show's filming {{sets were}} changed between episodes. The Psych office was {{expanded}} and refurnished, afterwards becoming {{the second largest}} stage for the show. The house for Henry Spencer was changed, {{in order to be}} closer to the ocean. The set for Chief Vick's office was also changed, and was repainted to brighten the scenes shot in it. Much of the episode was filmed on a <b>sound</b> <b>stage,</b> while several other scenes were filmed {{in the basement of the}} facility. Much of the installment was written to take place in Santa Barbara's Arlington Theater. Several of the episode's scenes were written by Franks while filming the pilot episode.|$|E
5|$|The barren desert {{surface of}} Ceti Alpha V was {{simulated}} on stage 8, the largest <b>sound</b> <b>stage</b> at Paramount's studio. The set was elevated 25 {{feet off the}} ground and covered in wooden mats, over which tons of colored sand and powder were dumped. A cyclorama was painted and wrapped around the set, while massive industrial fans created a sandstorm. The filming was uncomfortable for actors and crew alike. The spandex environmental suits Koenig and Winfield wore were unventilated, and the actors had to signal by microphone when they needed air. Filming equipment was wrapped in plastic to prevent mechanical troubles and everyone on set wore boots, masks, and coveralls as protection from flying sand.|$|E

5|$|The day of filming in the salvage yard, {{which took}} place at LA Japanese Auto Parts in Sun Valley, California, was {{abnormally}} hot according to Lauren Vélez. The Airstream trailer in which Dexter's victim is found was brought into the salvage yard for filming externally, but was assembled on a studio <b>sound</b> <b>stage</b> for shooting scenes inside the trailer. Erik King remarked that the trailer was dirty, odorous and humid—"all the things we needed it to be". Other filming locations included a waterfront house on Hibiscus Island in Biscayne Bay, Florida as the Castillos' home, an empty field next to Sun Valley's Tujunga Wash where a young Debra practices shooting with Harry's pistol, and {{a house in a}} residential neighborhood of Long Beach, California which stands in for Dexter's childhood home.|$|E
5|$|The film's locations, {{with the}} {{exception}} of scenes filmed at a museum and at a farmhouse, were built on the Montreal <b>sound</b> <b>stage.</b> Production designer James Chinlund and his crew built sets for The Fountain in a large warehouse in Montreal. The sets included the 16th century jungle settings and the bubble-shaped spacecraft containing the tree of life and its garden. The spacecraft set was placed against greenscreen, and the crew hung colored reflective material, which included green, black, gold, and silver, on three circular tracks around the set. One material would be moved into place instead of the heavy equipment, and with the other materials partitioned off, a light source was used with the preferred material. Silver was used for scenes in which the spacecraft moved through the stars, and gold was used for when it entered the nebula.|$|E
5|$|The film, {{produced}} through 20th Century Fox, is a co-production of the United States and the United Kingdom. Producer Simon Kinberg began {{developing the}} film after Fox optioned the novel in March 2013, which Drew Goddard adapted into a screenplay and was initially attached to direct, {{but the film}} did not move forward. Scott replaced Goddard, and with Damon in place as the main character, production was approved. Filming began in November 2014 and lasted approximately seventy days. Twenty sets were built on a <b>sound</b> <b>stage</b> in Budapest, Hungary, {{one of the largest}} in the world. Wadi Rum in Jordan was also used as a backdrop for filming.|$|E

50|$|In 1974, {{following}} the BBC's departure, a charitable trust formed by Hammersmith and Fulham Council {{took control of}} the building, and two large multi-purpose spaces designed by Michael Reardon were created from the Studio's two main <b>sound</b> <b>stages.</b> During the building's conversion in 1974-75, an amateur West London music group called The Strand illicitly used one of the <b>sound</b> <b>stages</b> for several months to rehearse. They went on to become The Sex Pistols.|$|R
