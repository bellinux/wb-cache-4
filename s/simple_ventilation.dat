5000|$|Hydrogen {{is locked}} up in {{enormous}} quantities in water, hydrocarbons, and other organic matter. One of the challenges of using hydrogen as a fuel comes {{from being able to}} efficiently extract hydrogen from these compounds. Currently, steam reforming, or combining high-temperature steam with natural gas, accounts {{for the majority of the}} hydrogen produced. [...] Hydrogen can also be produced from water through electrolysis, but this method is much more energy intensive. Once extracted, hydrogen is an energy carrier (i.e. a store for energy first generated by other means). The energy can be delivered to fuel cells and generate electricity and heat, or burned to run a combustion engine. In each case hydrogen is combined with oxygen to form water. The heat in a hydrogen flame is a radiant emission from the newly formed water molecules. The water molecules are in an excited state on initial formation and then transition to a ground state; the transition unleashing thermal radiation. When burning in air, the temperature is roughly 2000 °C. Historically, carbon has been the most practical carrier of energy, as more energy is packed in fossil fuels than pure liquid hydrogen of the same volume. The carbon atoms have classic storage capabilities and releases even more energy when burned with hydrogen. However, burning carbon base fuel and releasing its exhaust contributes to global warming due to the greenhouse effect of carbon gases. Pure hydrogen is the smallest element and some of it will inevitably escape from any known container or pipe in micro amounts, yet <b>simple</b> <b>ventilation</b> could prevent such leakage from ever reaching the volatile 4% hydrogen-air mixture. So long as the product is in a gaseous or liquid state, pipes are a classic and very efficient form of transportation. Pure hydrogen, though, causes metal to become brittle, suggesting metal pipes may not be ideal for hydrogen transport.|$|E

Relative to natural ventilation, air conditioning, with or without humidification, was consistently associated with a statistically {{significant increase in the}} prevalence of one or more SBS symptoms. Prevalences were typically higher by approximately 30 % to 200 % in the air conditioned buildings. In two of three assessments from a single study, symptom prevalences were also significantly higher in air conditioned buildings than in buildings with <b>simple</b> mechanical <b>ventilation</b> and no humidification. In approximately half of assessments, SBS symptom prevalences were significantly higher in buildings with <b>simple</b> mechanical <b>ventilation</b> than in buildings with natural ventilation. Insufficient information was available for conclusions about the potential increased risk of SBS symptoms with humidification. The statistically significant associations of mechanical ventilation and air conditioning with SBS symptoms are much more frequent than expected from chance and also not likely to be a consequence of confounding by several potential personal, job, or building related confounders. The reasons for the increases in symptom prevalences with mechanical ventilation and particularly with air conditioning remain unclear. Multiple deficiencies in HVAC system design, construction, operation, or maintenance, including some which cause pollutant emissions from HVAC systems, may contribute to the increases in symptom prevalences...|$|R

In this context, a growing interest for heat recovery ventilation has been observed during the last decades. The present paper focuses on a new single room ventilation with heat recovery. Double flow ventilation is achieved through {{the integration of the}} unit into windows ledges. The developed device is particularly suitable compared to traditional centralized heat recovery ventilation units for retrofitted houses due to the absence of air extracting and air pulsing ducts through the house. The first part of the paper consists in describing the characteristics and properties of the developed device (volume, components, flow configuration, advantages and drawbacks). In {{the second part of the}} paper, an experimental approach is presented to characterize the unit. The criteria of performance are based on: - Thermal effectiveness of the unit (testing of a recovery heat exchanger), - Hydraulic aspects (flows delivered by the unit vs energy supplied to the unit), - Acoustic aspects.

40|$|AbstractThe {{requirement}} of a minimum air flow rates in dwellings is {{new in the}} Spanish regulation. The value of the minimum air flow rate for each room of the dwelling depends {{on the type of}} room, its occupation or its dimensions. To achieve these air flow rates, in the houses built in the Basque Country, mechanical ventilation systems are installed, usually: simple flow with continuous extraction, hygrorregulated simple flow or double flow with heat recovery ventilation systems. The permeability of the envelope is a very important parameter, that must be cared for the correct performance of the ventilation system installed. This performance must be measured in terms of energy consumption, but also in terms of indoor air quality, because the objective of the ventilation system is to ensure an adequate indoor air quality.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{motivated}} by the difficulty of cultivating crops in very hot countries and by the tendency for some such countries to become dependent on imported food. Liquid desiccation with solar regeneration is considered {{as a means of}} lowering the temperature in evaporatively-cooled greenhouses. Previous studies demonstrated the technical feasibility of the desiccation-evaporation process, but mainly in the context of human dwellings. In the proposed cycle, the air is dried prior to entering the evaporative cooler. This lowers the wet-bulb temperature of the air. The cooling is assisted by using the regenerator to partially shade the greenhouse. The heat of desiccation is transferred and rejected at the outlet of the greenhouse. The cycle is analysed and results given for the climate of the The Gulf, based on weather data from Abu Dhabi. Taking examples of a temperate crop (lettuce), a tropical crop (tomato) and a tropical crop resistant to high temperatures (cucumber) we estimate the extension in growing seasons relative to (i) a greenhouse with <b>simple</b> fan <b>ventilation</b> (ii) a greenhouse with conventional evaporative cooling. Compared to option (ii), the proposed system lowers summers maximum temperatures by 5 degrees C.

The results show that the equivalent heat recovery effectiveness for these systems is low. Based on the results presented, we conclude that a thorough assessment of the specific boundary conditions is necessary to assess the potential of exhaust air heat pumps in every single project...|$|R
40|$|Since thermal {{environment}} affects production, egg quality and laying hens' mortality rates, {{it is highly}} relevant to control the {{thermal environment}} within poultry houses so that the best financial profits could be obtained. Three commercial poultry houses with different climatization systems are analyzed in current research: a poultry house with tunnel-like ventilation and pad cooling; a poultry house with natural ventilation and nebulization; a poultry house with <b>simple</b> natural <b>ventilation.</b> Their thermal environment, production, egg quality and laying hens' mortality rates among different poultry houses and at {{different areas of the}} same poultry house are compared. Economic profits based on difference in electric energy consumption by climatization systems and on the laying hens' productivity of each poultry house are calculated. Electricity meters were installed within the electrical circuits of the climatization and light systems of the three poultry houses. Data were registered between December 2011 and March 2012 and results showed that all the poultry houses featured heterogeneity in internal thermal environment with faults in the climatization systems. Important differences were reported in egg production and quality caused by overheating. The poultry house with tunnel-like ventilation and pad cooling had the best thermal isolation from the external environment that resulted in a 12. 04 % improvement in production, decrease between 30 and 40 % in laying hens' mortality rates and the best economic result. © G.
