25|$|The vacuum {{ultraviolet}} (VUV) band (100–200nm) can {{be generated}} by non-linear 4 wave mixing in gases by sum or difference frequency mixing of 2 or more longer wavelength lasers. The generation is generally done in gasses (e.g. krypton, hydrogen which are two-photon resonant near 193nm) or metal vapors (e.g. magnesium). By making one of the lasers tunable, the VUV can be tuned. If one of the lasers is resonant with a transition in the gas or vapor then the VUV production is intensified. However, resonances also generate wavelength dispersion, and thus the phase matching can limit the tunable range of the 4 wave mixing. Difference frequency mixing (lambda1 + lambda2 − lambda3) has an advantage over <b>sum</b> <b>frequency</b> mixing because the phase matching can provide greater tuning. In particular, difference frequency mixing two photons of an ArF (193nm) excimer laser with a tunable visible or near IR laser in hydrogen or krypton provides resonantly enhanced tunable VUV covering from 100nm to 200nm. Practically, the lack of suitable gas/vapor cell window materials above the lithium fluoride cut-off wavelength limit the tuning range to longer than about 110nm. Tunable VUV wavelengths down to 75 nm was achieved using window-free configurations.|$|E

In the case of broadband spectrometers, one laser (typically the visible laser) is kept at a fixed narrow wavelength, and the other laser produces a spectrally broad beam. These laser beams again overlap at the interface being studied, but can cover a wider range of resonances at once than a spectrometer operating in scanning mode and hence spectra can be acquired much faster, allowing the ability to perform time-resolved measurements with interfacial sensitivity [...]|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that in visual lexical decision response latencies to simplex nouns are shorter when these nouns have large morphological families, i. e., when they appear as constituents in large numbers of derived words and compounds. This study presents the results of four experiments that show that verbs have a Family Size effect independently of nominal conversion alternants, that this effect is a strict type frequency effect and not a token frequency effect, that the effect is co-determined by the morphological structure of the inected verb, and that it occurs irrespective of the orthographic shape of the base word. It is well known that various token frequency counts affect response latencies to simplex and complex words in visual lexical decision.

The radio receiver is responsive to any signal at its designed IF frequency, including unwanted signals.

A signal broadcast at 100 MHz (the wanted signal), and mixed with the 110 MHz LO will create the <b>sum</b> <b>frequency</b> of 210 MHz (ignored by the receiver), and the difference frequency at the desired 10 MHz.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{a critical}} issue in psycholinguistics, of whether the fundamental unit of representation in the mental lexicon is the morpheme. Are complex words, such as darkness, processed as whole forms or are they decomposed into their component morphemes dark and -ness? Research on this topic has provided preliminary evidence for decomposition by showing that response times to polymorphemic words such as darkness are influenced by <b>summed</b> <b>frequency</b> of the other words in the language containing the root morpheme (e. g. darken, darkly, darkish, etc). This thesis uses multivariate regression techniques to explore in greater depth than previously, {{both in terms of}} numbers of items and numbers of variables, the role of morphology in lexical access. It explores not only whether words are influenced by the <b>summed</b> <b>frequency</b> of the morpheme but also whether whole word frequency is important. It also asks whether for singular nouns the word-form frequency (the frequency of the form itself) or the lemma <b>frequency</b> (the <b>summed</b> <b>frequency</b> of all inflectional variants) is the better predictor of response times. Additionally, the role of meaning relationships between words sharing a morpheme {{and the role of the}} productivity of the suffix (the likelihood that a new form will be coined with a suffix) are investigated. Results showed that for singular nouns in standard lexical decision, the frequency of the form itself was a better predictor of response times than the lemma frequency. The semantic relationships between items and the complex forms in which they are root morphemes were also shown to be predictive of response times. However, when sampled at an earlier time point in processing, using lexical decision with a response deadline, lemma frequency was the better predictor and semantic effects were not significant. Response times to derived words were influenced both by the frequency of the root morpheme and the frequency of the form itself. The productivity of the suffix was also important. Productive items showed significantly stronger effects of morphemic frequency and of the semantic relatedness between the derived form and its stem. Distributed connectionist modelling captured important aspects of the behavioural data indicating that some aspects of morphology may be an emergent property of regularities in the mapping between form and meaning in morphologically complex forms.
