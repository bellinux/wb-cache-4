By either adding or subtracting the resulting signals, a lower or upper sideband signal results. A benefit of this approach is to allow an analytical expression for SSB signals, which can be used to understand effects such as synchronous detection of SSB.|$|E

5000|$|In a radio receiver, a beat {{frequency}} oscillator or BFO is a dedicated oscillator used to create an audio frequency signal from Morse code radiotelegraphy (CW) transmissions to make them audible. The signal from the BFO is mixed with the received signal to create a heterodyne or {{beat frequency}} which is heard as a tone in the speaker. BFOs are also used to demodulate single-sideband (<b>SSB)</b> <b>signals,</b> making them intelligible, by essentially restoring the carrier that was suppressed at the transmitter. BFOs are sometimes included in communications receivers designed for short wave listeners; they are almost always fitted to amateur radio station receivers, which often receive CW and <b>SSB</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|R
50|$|For the {{reception}} of single-sideband (<b>SSB)</b> <b>signals,</b> the circuit is also set to oscillate. The BFO signal is adjusted {{to one side of}} the incoming signal, and functions as the replacement carrier needed to demodulate the signal.|$|R
2500|$|Note {{that there}} are two choices for : 43000Hz and 47000Hz, called [...] {{low-side}} and high-side injection. With high-side injection, the spectral components that were distributed around 45000Hz will be distributed around 2000Hz in the reverse order, also known as an inverted spectrum. That is in fact desirable when the IF spectrum is also inverted, because the BFO inversion restores the proper relationships. One reason for that is when the IF spectrum is the output of an inverting stage in the receiver. Another reason is when the <b>SSB</b> <b>signal</b> is actually a lower sideband, instead of an upper sideband. But if both reasons are true, then the IF spectrum is not inverted, and the non-inverting BFO (43000Hz) should be used.|$|E
2500|$|One {{method of}} {{producing}} an <b>SSB</b> <b>signal</b> {{is to remove}} one of the sidebands via filtering, leaving only either the upper sideband (USB), the sideband with the higher frequency, or less commonly the lower sideband (LSB), the sideband with the lower frequency. Most often, the carrier is reduced or removed entirely (suppressed), being referred to in full as single sideband suppressed carrier (SSBSC). Assuming both sidebands are symmetric, which {{is the case for}} a normal AM signal, no information is lost in the process. [...] Since the final RF amplification is now concentrated in a single sideband, the effective power output is greater than in normal AM (the carrier and redundant sideband account for well over half of the power output of an AM transmitter). Though SSB uses substantially less bandwidth and power, it cannot be demodulated by a simple envelope detector like standard AM.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA well known problem associated with suppressed-carrier single sideband (SSP) communications is {{the difficulty of}} accurately tuning a receiver to the suppressed-carrier frequency of the transmitter is this frequency is not known a priori at the receiver. Although {{it is possible to}} tune a receiver to within 20 to 30 Hz of the correct frequency by tuning for the most natural voice timbre (in the case of radiotelephone voice transmissions), this is an unacceptably subjective and inexact method to use in signal and frequency monitoring applications. This report describes an aural-visual method of tuning a SSB receive to within 3 Hz of the suppressed-carrier frequency of a <b>SSB</b> voice <b>signal</b> containing no discernible carrier. This tuning method supplements the familiar aural technique (tuning for most natural voice quality) with a visual oscilloscope display which facilitates an order of magnitude improvement in the accuracy of frequency measurement compared with aural tuning alone. A theoretical analysis is presented which shows that <b>SSB</b> speech <b>signals</b> contain information sufficient to determine the suppressed-carrier frequency. Also described are experiments which were conducted to indicate the effectiveness of this tuning method in determining the carrier frequency of <b>SSB</b> <b>signals</b> when the <b>SSB</b> message is human speech.
