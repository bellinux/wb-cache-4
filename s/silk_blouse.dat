500|$|On 9 July 1957, O'Hara filed a $5 million {{lawsuit against}} Confidential {{magazine}} over allegations it made over her being engaged {{in sexual activity}} with Parra during a screening of a film at the Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. One of the allegations was [...] "Maureen had entered Grauman's wearing a white <b>silk</b> <b>blouse</b> neatly buttoned. Now it wasn't", and that when the usher shone a flashlight towards them {{she was forced to}} sit up and play innocent. O'Hara proved her innocence by presenting a passport showing that she was in Spain shooting Fire Over Africa at the time. She claimed in her autobiography that she became the first actress to win a case against an industry tabloid when Confidential were apparently found guilty of libel and conspiring to publish obscenity, but Malone notes that the trial dragged on for six weeks and the case was actually eventually settled out of court in July 1958.|$|E
500|$|The video {{opens with}} a bird's-eye view of Mumbai, with Azalea's name and [...] "Bounce" [...] in large yellow text. Scenes with local {{residents}} include a young Indian boy and children playing cricket. Azalea, in a gold bodysuit and Indian inspired clothing, slouches atop an Indian elephant. The song begins with Azalea and a troupe of female Indian dancers entering a darkened Bollywood set for a traditional Indian wedding. Azalea and the dancers, in traditional red saris with bindis, begin belly dancing and modernised Indian dance routines. The scene is intercut with snippets of Azalea walking and dancing in Mumbai's slums. On the Bollywood set, a large Indian family are seen celebrating, drinking and dancing. Azalea (in a green sari) dances in a garden, rides an elephant along city streets and travels in an auto rickshaw, wearing a printed <b>silk</b> <b>blouse,</b> with the wind blowing through her hair. Now in a blue sari, she lies on the elephant, gesturing with her hands and dancing next to Indian children on a cluttered platform.|$|E

5000|$|Also notable is {{the return}} of Coco Chanel (who detested the [...] "New Look") to the fashion world. Following the closure of her salons in the war years, in 1954, aged over seventy, she staged a {{comeback}} and on February 5 she presented a collection which contained {{a whole range of}} ideas that would be adopted and copied by women all over the world: her famous little braided suit with gold chains, shiny costume jewelry, <b>silk</b> <b>blouses</b> in colors that matched the suit linings, sleek tweeds, monogrammed buttons, flat black silk bows, boaters, quilted bags on chains, and evening dresses and furs that were marvels of simplicity.|$|R
60|$|She {{was small}} and active and sallow; her yellow hair was faded, and looked dry; her blue <b>silk</b> <b>blouses</b> and modest lace collars and high black shoes and sailor hats were as literal and uncharming as a schoolroom desk; but her eyes {{determined}} her appearance, revealed her as a personage and a force, indicated her faith in the goodness and purpose of everything. They were blue, and they were never still; they expressed amusement, pity, enthusiasm. If she had been seen in sleep, with the wrinkles beside her eyes stilled and the creased lids hiding the radiant irises, she would have lost her potency.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Morel {{sat in her}} rocking-chair, {{wearing her}} black <b>silk</b> <b>blouse.</b> Her grey-brown hair was taken smooth back from her brow and her high temples; her face was rather pale. Clara, suffering, {{followed}} Paul into the kitchen. Mrs. Morel rose. Clara thought her a lady, even rather stiff. The young woman was very nervous. She had almost a wistful look, almost resigned.|$|E
60|$|Miss Haldin {{mentioned}} {{her name}} and also the name of Peter Ivanovitch. The girlish, elderly woman nodded and puckered her face into a momentary expression of sympathy. Her black <b>silk</b> <b>blouse</b> was old and even frayed in places; the black serge skirt was short and shabby. She continued to blink at close quarters, and her eyelashes and eyebrows seemed shabby too. Miss Haldin, speaking gently to her, as if to an unhappy and sensitive person, explained how it was that her visit could not be an altogether unexpected event to Madame de S--.|$|E
60|$|She sat {{and talked}} about the dinner on the train, which had been so poor; about London, about dances. She was really very nervous, and chattered from fear. Morel sat all the time smoking his thick twist tobacco, {{watching}} her, and listening to her glib London speech, as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black <b>silk</b> <b>blouse,</b> answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess. Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups, the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange, not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them. William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.|$|E
5000|$|According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, Rabbit played [...] "a thumping {{brand of}} {{commercial}} glam-boogie (somewhere between US groups like Kiss and Brownsville Station) {{and the members}} decked themselves out in bare-chested <b>silk</b> <b>blouses,</b> spandex leggings and stack-heeled boots... The climax of the band's shows came with Screen's spectacular fire-breathing displays." [...] The group relocated to Sydney where they signed with CBS Records Australia. Rabbit's debut single, [...] "Lady La Di Da", was a cover version of a track by a Swedish group, New Quidesty Blaise (a.k.a. NQB), which was written by that band's guitarist-vocalist, Elisabeth Åhlander. A music video was supplied to promote the track. Its B-side, [...] "Marvel Man", was co-written by Evans and Tinson.|$|R

"Her {{official}} {{task was}} to bring her eccentric style to accessories and jewellery, and she duly came up with often-chunky designs incorporating large colourful stones, enamel work or rock crystal". La Falaise also inspired Saint Laurent with her inventive wardrobe: [...] "one week she was Desdemona in purple velvet flares and a crown of flowers, the next Marlene Dietrich with plucked crescent-shaped eyebrows". In 2002, when Saint Laurent retired, La Falaise began producing her own clothing and jewellery designs. As reported in The New York Times by fashion writer Cathy Horyn, [...] "The clothing line captured much of her rare taste—well-cut blazers in the best English tweeds, French sailor pants in linen, striped <b>silk</b> <b>blouses</b> with cheeky black lace edging, masculine walking coats with fur linings, and gorgeous knits in perfectly chosen colors".|$|R

Therefore Susan had all the comfortable consciousness of a well-dressed woman as she opened her copy of the Daily Enterprise and prepared to read the Glen [...] "Notes" [...] which, as Miss Cornelia had just informed her, filled half a column of it and mentioned almost everybody at Ingleside. There was a big, black headline {{on the front page}} of the Enterprise, stating that some Archduke Ferdinand or other had been assassinated at a place bearing the weird name of Sarajevo, but Susan tarried not over uninteresting, immaterial stuff like that; she was in quest of something really vital. Oh, here it was--"Jottings from Glen St. Mary." [...] Susan settled down keenly, reading each one over aloud to extract all possible gratification from it.|$|E
60|$|He {{sat down}} at his desk, but his blood was warm, and he read the typewritten words of the topmost letter of the pile {{without so much as}} {{grasping}} the meaning of them. From time to time he glanced up at Janet as she flitted about the room. By George, she was more desirable than he had ever dared to imagine! He felt temporarily balked, but hopeful. On his way to the mill he had dwelt with Epicurean indulgence on this sight of her, and he had not been disappointed. He had also thought that he might venture upon more than the mere feasting of his eyes, yet found an inspiring alleviation in the fact that she by no means absolutely repulsed him. Her attitude toward him had undergone a subtle transformation. There could be no doubt of that. She was almost coquettish. His eyes lingered. The china <b>silk</b> <b>blouse</b> was slightly open at the neck, suggesting the fullness of her throat; it clung to the outline of her shoulders. Overcome by an impulse he could not control, he got up and went toward her, but she avoided him.|$|E

[...] The following day, on July 15, Olga and her sisters appeared in good spirits as they joked {{with one another and}} moved the beds in their room so visiting cleaning women could scrub the floor.

The boy had actually been sent to a hotel across the street because the guards did not want to kill him {{along with the rest of}} the Romanov party. The family, unaware of the plan to kill them, was upset and unsettled by Sednev's absence. Dr. Eugene Botkin and Tatiana went that evening to Yurovsky's office, for what was to be the last time, to ask for the return of the kitchen boy who kept Alexei amused during the long hours of captivity. Yurovsky placated them by telling them the boy would return soon, but the family was unconvinced.|$|R
60|$|Cecilia {{had on a}} Persian-green <b>silk</b> <b>blouse</b> with sleeves {{that would}} have hidden her slim hands, but for silver buttons made in the {{likeness}} of little roses at her wrists; on her brow was a faint frown, {{as though she were}} wondering what her thoughts were all about. She sat there every morning catching those thoughts, and placing them in one or other of her little books. Only by thus working hard could she keep herself, her husband, and daughter, in due touch with all the different movements going on. And that the touch might be as due as possible, she had a little headache nearly every day. For the dread of letting slip one movement, or of being too much taken with another, was very real to her; there were so many people who were interesting, so many sympathies of hers and Stephen's which she desired to cultivate, that {{it was a matter of}} the utmost import not to cultivate any single one too much. Then, too, the duty of remaining feminine with all this going forward taxed her constitution. She sometimes thought enviously of the splendid isolation now enjoyed by Blanca, of which some subtle instinct, rather than definite knowledge, had informed her; but not often, for she was a loyal little person, to whom Stephen and his comforts were of the first moment. And though she worried somewhat because her thoughts WOULD come by every post, she did not worry very much--hardly more than the Persian kitten on her lap, who also sat for hours trying to catch her tail, with a line between her eyes, and two small hollows in her cheeks.|$|E

The finding of Cannabis in a container near the body let to suppose this drug was used to relieve the chronic pains of the woman. She may have had the elevated status of a priestess in her community based upon the items found in her chamber.

There were remains of coriander seeds in a stone dish that may have been provided for the Maiden’s medicinal use.|$|R

True to the style of the music, Revolution is extremely fast-paced and performed with an aggression that neither had displayed before.
