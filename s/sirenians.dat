5|$|The Sirenia, {{commonly}} referred to as sea cows or <b>sirenians,</b> are an order of fully aquatic, herbivorous mammals that inhabit swamps, rivers, estuaries, marine wetlands, and coastal marine waters. The Sirenia currently comprise the families Dugongidae (the dugong) and Trichechidae (manatees) with a total of four species. The Protosirenidae (Eocene <b>sirenians)</b> and Prorastomidae (terrestrial <b>sirenians)</b> families are extinct. <b>Sirenians</b> are classified in the clade Paenungulata, alongside the elephants and the hyraxes, and evolved in the Eocene 50 million years ago. The Dugongidae diverged from the Trichechidae in the late Eocene or early Oligocene.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sirenians</b> first {{appeared}} in the fossil record in the Early Eocene and significantly diversified throughout the epoch. They inhabited rivers, estuaries, and nearshore marine waters. <b>Sirenians,</b> unlike other marine mammals such as cetaceans, lived in the New World. The earliest aquatic sirenian discovered is Prorastomus which dates back to 40 million years ago, and the first known sirenian, the quadruped Pezosiren, lived 50 million years ago. Prorastomidae and Protosirenidae, the earliest sirenian families, consisted of pig-like amphibious creatures who died {{out at the end of}} the Eocene. When the Dugongidae appeared at this time, <b>sirenians</b> had evolved the characteristics of modern variety, including an aquatic streamlined body with flipper-like front legs with no hind limbs, and a powerful tail with horizontal caudal fins which uses an up-and-down motion to move them through the water.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sirenians,</b> the sea cows, became aquatic around 40 {{million years}} ago. The first {{appearance}} of <b>sirenians</b> in {{the fossil record}} was during the early Eocene, and by the late Eocene, <b>sirenians</b> had significantly diversified. Inhabitants of rivers, estuaries, and nearshore marine waters, {{they were able to}} spread rapidly. The most primitive sirenian, †Prorastomus, was found in Jamaica, unlike other marine mammals which originated from the Old World (such as cetaceans). The first known quadrupedal sirenian was †Pezosiren from the early Eocene. The earliest known sea cows, of the families †Prorastomidae and †Protosirenidae, were both confined to the Eocene, and were pig-sized, four-legged, amphibious creatures. The first members of Dugongidae appeared {{by the end of the}} Eocene. At this point, sea cows were fully aquatic.|$|E
50|$|In December 2000, the Sea Shepherd ship, <b>Sirenian,</b> {{was sent}} to the Galápagos to assist in patrolling the 130,000 square {{kilometre}} marine reserve around the Islands. Sea Shepherd had signed a five-year agreement with the Galápagos National Park Directorate to provide the <b>Sirenian,</b> with some crew, as a patrol vessel. Under the agreement, the <b>Sirenian</b> had an Ecuadorian captain, engineer, and carries Park Service officers. The <b>Sirenian</b> is a 95-foot former United States Coast Guard Cutter and is now permanently stationed in the Galápagos.|$|R

5|$|The {{evolution}} of <b>sirenians</b> {{is characterized by}} the appearance of several traits, which are found in all <b>sirenians</b> (monophyly). The nostrils are large and retracted, the upper-jaw bone contacts the frontal bone, the sagittal crest is missing, the mastoid fills the supratemporal fenestra (an opening {{on the top of the}} skull), a drop-like ectotympanic (a bony ring that holds the ear drum), and pachyosteosclerotic (dense and bulky) bones.|$|E
5|$|While breathing, {{they hold}} just their {{nostrils}} above the surface, sometimes standing on their tails to do so. <b>Sirenians</b> typically inhabit warm, shallow, coastal waters, or rivers. They are mainly herbivorous, {{but have been}} known to consume animals such as birds and jellyfish. Males typically mate with more than one female (polygyny), and may participate in lek mating. <b>Sirenians</b> are K-selectors, and display parental care.|$|E
5|$|Fully aquatic mammals, the {{cetaceans}} and <b>sirenians,</b> {{have lost}} their legs and have a tail fin to propel themselves through the water. Flipper movement is continuous. Whales swim by moving their tail fin and lower body up and down, propelling themselves through vertical movement, while their flippers are mainly used for steering. Their skeletal anatomy allows them to be fast swimmers. Most species have a dorsal fin to prevent themselves from turning upside-down in the water. The flukes of <b>sirenians</b> are raised {{up and down in}} long strokes to move the animal forward, and can be twisted to turn. The forelimbs are paddle-like flippers which aid in turning and slowing.|$|E

5|$|Environmental hazards {{induced by}} humans also puts <b>sirenians</b> at risk. <b>Sirenians,</b> {{especially}} the West Indian manatee, face high mortality from watercraft collision, {{and about half}} of all West Indian manatee deaths are caused by watercraft collisions. An increased usage of hydroelectric power and subsequent damming of rivers increase waterway traffic, which can lead to vessel collisions, and manatees may become entangled in navigational locks. The urbanized coastline of areas such as the Caribbean and Australia can result in the decline of seagrass populations. Reliable areas of warm water in Florida are generally the result of discharge from power plants, but newer plants with more efficient cooling systems may disrupt the pattern of warm water refuges, and an increased demand for artesian springs for water, the natural source of warm water, decreases the number of warm water refuges. <b>Sirenians</b> can be caught as bycatch from fisheries, and they can be seen as pests with the interference of local fishermen and the destruction of their nets. African manatees have also been known to venture into rice paddies and destroy the crops during the rainy season, and these confrontations with locals may lead to intentional culling of the manatees.|$|E
5|$|Sirenia, {{commonly}} <b>sirenians,</b> {{are also}} referred to by the common name sirens, deriving from the sirens of Greek mythology. This comes from a legend about their discovery, involving lonely sailors mistaking them for mermaids. Seekoei (sea cow) is also the name for a hippopotamus in Afrikaans.|$|E
5|$|All <b>sirenians</b> are {{protected}} by the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), the Endangered Species Act (ESA), and the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). In addition to this, the four species are further protected by various specialty organizations. The Dugong is listed in the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Convention on Migratory Species, and the Coral Triangle Initiative. In Florida, manatees {{are protected}} by the Florida Manatee Sanctuary Act of 1978, which implements actions such as the limitation or prohibition of watercraft speeds where manatees exist.|$|E

5|$|Despite being mostly solitary, <b>sirenians</b> congregate {{in groups}} while females are in estrus. These groups usually include one female with {{multiple}} males. <b>Sirenians</b> are K-selectors, so, despite the longevity, females give birth {{only a few}} times during their life and invest considerable parental care in their young. Dugongs generally gather in groups of less than a dozen individuals for one to two days. Since they congregate in turbid waters, little is known about their reproductive behavior. The males are often seen with scars, and the tusks on dugongs grow in first for males, suggesting they are important in lekking. They have also been known to lunge at each other. The age when a female first gives birth is disputed, ranging anywhere from six to seventeen years. The time between births is unclear, with estimates ranging from 2 to 7 years. Manatees can reach sexual maturity as early as two to five years of age. Manatee gestation length is around one year, and then they lactate for one to two years. West Indian manatees and African manatees can breed year-round, and a female will mate with multiple male partners. Amazonian manatees have a breeding season, usually mating when the river levels begin to rise, which varies from place to place.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} indicates that megalodon preyed upon many cetacean species, such as dolphins, small whales, cetotheres, squalodontids, sperm whales, bowhead whales, and rorquals. In addition to this, they also targeted seals, <b>sirenians,</b> and large sea turtles. However, the shark was also an opportunist and piscivorous, {{and it would have}} also gone after smaller fish and other sharks. Many whale bones have been found with deep gashes most likely made by their teeth. Various excavations have revealed megalodon teeth lying close to the chewed remains of whales, and sometimes in direct association with them.|$|E
5|$|Most {{amphibians}} today remain semiaquatic, {{living the}} first stage of their lives as fish-like tadpoles. Several groups of tetrapods, such as the snakes and cetaceans, have lost some or all of their limbs. In addition, many tetrapods have returned to partially aquatic or fully aquatic lives throughout the history of the group (modern examples of fully aquatic tetrapods include cetaceans and <b>sirenians).</b> The first returns to an aquatic lifestyle may have occurred as early as the Carboniferous Period whereas other returns occurred as recently as the Cenozoic, as in cetaceans, pinnipeds, and several modern amphibians.|$|E

40|$|Postcranial {{remains of}} Sirenia {{from the early}} Middle Eocene (late Lutetian) Urbasa-Andia Formation of Navarre (Western Pyrenees) are described. The {{material}} consists of two partial atlas vertebrae, one humerus and several dorsal ribs (from Arrasate, Urbasa plateau), and partial dorsal ribs (from Lezaun, Andia plateau). The morphology of the fossils is consistent with referral to Dugongidae, the only <b>sirenian</b> clade known {{so far in the}} Middle Eocene of Europe. Moreover, the histological study of the ribs shows that the pachyosteosclerosis of extant Sirenia was definitively present by the early Middle Eocene. The oldest <b>sirenian</b> remains reported to date in the Pyrenean Realm were assigned to the Biarritzian, a regional stage that is currently ascribed either to the middle or to the lower-middle Bartonian. Therefore, the <b>sirenian</b> remains of Lezaun, reliably dated as late Lutetian (SBZ 16 zone) in age, are definitively the earliest <b>sirenian</b> fossils known in Western Europe and are among the oldest sea cow records of Europe...|$|R
5|$|Sirenia is {{an order}} of fully aquatic, herbivorous mammals that inhabit rivers, estuaries, coastal marine waters, swamps and marine wetlands. <b>Sirenians,</b> {{including}} manatees and dugongs, possess major aquatic adaptations: arms used for steering, a paddle used for propulsion, and remnants of hind limbs (legs) {{in the form of}} two small bones floating deep in the muscle. They look ponderous and clumsy but are actually fusiform, hydrodynamic and highly muscular, and mariners before the mid-nineteenth century referred to them as mermaids.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sirenians</b> are {{classified}} within the cohort Afrotheria in the clade Paenungulata, alongside Proboscidea (elephants), Hyracoidea (hyraxes), Embrithopoda, Desmostylia, and Afroinsectiphilia. This clade was first established by George Gaylord Simpson in 1945 based on anatomical evidence, such as testicondy and similar fetal development. The Paenungulata, {{along with the}} Afrotheria, {{are one of the}} most well-supported mammalian clades in molecular phylogeny. Sirenia, Proboscidae, and Desmotylia are grouped together in the clade Tethytheria. Based on morphological similarities, Tethytheria, Perissodactyla, and Hyracoidea were considered to be grouped together as the Altungulata, but this has been invalidated by molecular data.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} indicates the Enhydra lineage became {{isolated in the}} North Pacific approximately 2 Mya, giving rise to the now-extinct Enhydra macrodonta and the modern sea otter, Enhydra lutris. The sea otter evolved initially in northern Hokkaidō and Russia, and then spread east to the Aleutian Islands, mainland Alaska, and down the North American coast. In comparison to cetaceans, <b>sirenians,</b> and pinnipeds, which entered the water approximately 50, 40, and 20 Mya, respectively, the sea otter is a relative newcomer to a marine existence. In some respects, though, the sea otter is more fully adapted to water than pinnipeds, which must haul out on land or ice to give birth.|$|E

50|$|In November 2000, the fishers {{reacted to}} new catch limits on lobster by ransacking the Park Service offices, the {{facilities}} of the Darwin Research Centre and trashing the Park Director's home, burning his possessions in the street.

The <b>Sirenian</b> captured four illegal boats {{in the first three}} weeks of March, 2001.|$|R
5000|$|On September 8, 2016, Norwegian gothic metal band Sirenia {{announced}} that Zoldan is their new official vocalist, after the Spanish singer Ailyn Gimenez was dismissed without her being noticed.

She contributed with lead vocals on a cover of Leonard Cohen [...] "First We Take Manhattan", included in the EP <b>Sirenian</b> Shores (2004).|$|R
5|$|Marine mammal {{adaptation}} to an aquatic lifestyle varies considerably between species. Both cetaceans and <b>sirenians</b> are fully aquatic and therefore are obligate water dwellers. Seals and sea-lions are semiaquatic; they spend {{the majority of}} their time in the water, but need to return to land for important activities such as mating, breeding and molting. In contrast, both otters and the polar bear are much less adapted to aquatic living. Their diet varies considerably as well; some may eat zooplankton, others may eat fish, squid, shellfish, sea-grass and a few may eat other mammals. While the number of marine mammals is small compared to those found on land, their roles in various ecosystems are large, especially concerning the maintenance of marine ecosystems, through processes including the regulation of prey populations. This role in maintaining ecosystems makes them of particular concern as 23% of marine mammal species are currently threatened.|$|E
25|$|The closest living {{relatives}} of elephants are the aquatic <b>sirenians,</b> while their next relatives are hyraxes, which {{look more like}} well-fed guinea pigs.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} known proboscideans, the clade {{that contains}} the elephants, existed about 55 million years ago around the Tethys Sea area. The closest relatives of the Proboscidea are the <b>sirenians</b> and the hyraxes. The family Elephantidae {{is known to have}} existed six million years ago in Africa, and includes the living elephants and the mammoths. Among many now extinct clades, the mastodon is only a distant relative of the mammoths, and part of the separate Mammutidae family, which diverged 25 million years before the mammoths evolved.|$|E
