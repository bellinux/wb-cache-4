40|$|Background: One of {{the most}} studied pro-angiogenic factors {{involved}} {{in the development of}} colorectal cancer is the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor <b>semaxanib</b> (SU 5416) is one of the several agents targeting the VEGF signaling pathway, and its development centered mostly in the treatment of colorectal cancer. Methods: We designed and conducted an NCI-sponsored trial to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of <b>semaxanib</b> given twice weekly in combination with weekly irinotecan in patients with advanced colorectal cancer who had failed at least one prior treatment. The irinotecan dose was fixed at 125 mg/m 2 given weekly for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks of rest. Patients with prior pelvic irradiation received a reduced dose of 100 mg/m 2. The <b>semaxanib</b> dosewas escalated, going from 85 to 110 mg/m 2 and finally to 145 mg/m 2. Results: Ten patients were treated in our study and all were evaluable for toxicity. There were no drug-related Grade 4 toxicities. There was one episode of Grade 3 headache and one episode of Grade 3 vomiting. The most common Grades 1 and 2 toxicities included diarrhea, abdominal cramping, anemia and nausea. Nine patients completed at least one 6 week cycle of treatment and were considered evaluable for response. Among those nine, two had a partial response, three had stable disease and four had progressive disease after the first cycle. Conclusions: Both irinotecan and <b>semaxanib</b> could be given at their full single-agent recom-mended doses without significant toxicity, and the combination showed signs of clinical activity. However, owing to discouraging results from Phase III trials, it is unlikely that this combination will be further explored.

To compare the severity of experimental PH between male and female athymic rats. Methods. PH was induced in 11 male and 11 female athymic rats (resp., SU_M and SU_F groups) using an inhibitor of VEGF-receptors I and II, <b>semaxanib</b> (40 [*]mg/kg). After 28 days, right ventricular (RV) remodeling, systolic function, and hemodynamics were measured using echocardiography and a pressure-volume admittance catheter.

Males developed marked RV enlargement and systolic dysfunction compared to females. Impairment of RV-PA coupling efficiency was observed only in SU_M. The smooth muscle cells of the pulmonary arteries switched from a contractile state to a dedifferentiated state only in males. Conclusions. Female athymic rats were protected against the development of severe PH. RV-PA coupling was preserved in females through limitation of pulmonary artery muscularization.

40|$|AbstractMolecular {{signaling}} {{of messages}} emanating from cellular membranes through receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) {{is a major}} mechanism for intercellular communication and transduction during development and metabolism, {{as well as in}} disease-associated processes. The phosphorylation status and signaling activity of RTKs are determined by a dynamic equilibrium of the activity of both RTKs and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). RTKs are essentially a class of cell-surface receptors for growth factors and other extracellular ligands, the most conspicuous perhaps are members of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene family, which plays a fundamental role in the growth and differentiation of vascular, as well as lymphatic endothelial cells. In particular, VEGF is a major regulator of normal (physiologic) and abnormal (cancerous) angiogenesis, including that associated with tumors and cancer. Blockers/inhibitors and regulators of RTKs are indeed promising cancer interventions, their specific mechanisms are yet to be unraveled. In this cutting-edge synopsis, I elaborate on breakthroughs/advances and current concepts of RTK regulation, further shedding light on exploring the role of potential regulators, particularly the RTK inhibitor <b>Semaxanib,</b> and the mechanisms associated with tumorigenesis in an effort to understand a potentially alleviating pharmacologic therapeutic intervention. This survey also tackles the loopholes and shortcomings of the aforementioned inhibitory role of <b>Semaxanib,</b> especially its inefficacy and ultimate discontinuation of relevant clinical trials...|$|E

A key structural motif retained throughout medicinal chemistry efforts during sunitinib 2 ̆ 7 s development was the indoline- 2 -one group. In the search for new anti-angiogenic scaffolds, we previously reported that non-indoline- 2 -one-based derivatives of <b>semaxanib</b> (SU 5416, a structurally simpler sunitinib predecessor that underwent Phase III trials) are active as angiogenesis inhibitors, indicating that the group is not essential for activity. This Letter describes the synthesis and structure-activity relationships of another class of non-indoline- 2 -one angiogenesis inhibitors related to sunitinib/semaxanib; the 5, 7 -dimethyl- 2 -aryl- 3 H-pyrrolizin- 3 -ones. A focussed library of 19 analogues was prepared using a simple novel process, wherein commercially available substituted arylacetic acids activated with an amide coupling reagent (HBTU) were reacted with the potassium salt of 3, 5 -dimethyl- 1 H-pyrrole- 2 -carbaldehyde in one-pot. Screening of the library using a cell-based endothelial tube formation assay identified 6 compounds with anti-angiogenesis activity. Two of the compounds were advanced to the more physiologically relevant rat aortic ring assay, where they showed similar inhibitory effects to <b>semaxanib</b> at 10 μg/mL, confirming that 5, 7 -dimethyl- 2 -aryl- 3 H-pyrrolizin- 3 -ones represent a new class of angiogenesis inhibitors...|$|E

Previously, SU 5205 was used as a radiolabelled inhibitor (as surrogate for SU 5416) and a radiotracer for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, but the compound exhibited poor stability and only a moderate IC 50 toward VEGFR 2. In the current work, the relationship between the structure and activity of these drugs as VEGFR 2 inhibitors was studied using 3 D-QSAR, docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. First, comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) was performed using 48 2 -indolinone derivatives and their VEGFR 2 inhibitory activities. The best CoMFA model was carried out over a training set including 40 compounds, and it included steric and electrostatic fields. In addition, this model gave satisfactory cross-validation results and adequately predicted 8 compounds contained in the test set. The plots of the CoMFA fields could explain the structural differences between <b>semaxanib</b> and SU 5205. Docking and molecular dynamics simulations showed that both molecules have the same orientation and dynamics inside the VEGFR 2 active site. However, the hydrophobic pocket of VEGFR 2 was more exposed to the solvent media when it was complexed with SU 5205. An energetic analysis, including Embrace and MM-GBSA calculations, revealed that the potency of ligand binding is governed by van der Waals contacts. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Clinical {{and animal}} studies {{implicate}} erythropoietin (EPO) and EPO receptor (EPOR) signaling in angiogenesis. In the eye, EPO {{is involved in}} both physiological and pathological angiogenesis in the retina. We hypothesized that EPOR signaling is important in pathological angiogenesis and tested this hypothesis using a rat model of oxygen-induced retinopathy that is representative of human retinopathy of prematurity. We first determined that EPOR expression and activation were increased and that activated EPOR was localized to retinal vascular endothelial cells (ECs) in retinas at postnatal day 18 (p 18), when pathological angiogenesis {{in the form of}} intravitreal neovascularization occurred. In human retinal microvascular ECs, EPOR was up-regulated and activated by VEGF. Lentiviral-delivered shRNAs that knocked down Müller cell–expressed VEGF in the retinopathy of prematurity model also reduced phosphorylated EPOR (p-EPOR) and VEGFR 2 (p-VEGFR 2) in retinal ECs. In human retinal microvascular ECs, VEGFR 2 -activated EPOR caused an interaction between p-EPOR and p-VEGFR 2; knockdown of EPOR by siRNA transfection reduced VEGF-induced EC proliferation in association with reduced p-VEGFR 2 and p-STAT 3; however, inhibition of VEGFR 2 activation by siRNA transfection or <b>semaxanib</b> (SU 5416) abolished VEGFA-induced proliferation of ECs and phosphorylation of VEGFR 2, EPOR, and STAT 3. Our results show that VEGFA-induced p-VEGFR 2 activates EPOR and causes an interaction between p-EPOR and p-VEGFR 2 to enhance VEGFA-induced EC proliferation by exacerbating STAT 3 activation, leading to pathological angiogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Pulmonary {{arterial}} hypertension (PAH) {{is characterized by}} elevated pulmonary arterial pressure with lumen-occluding neointimal and plexiform lesions. Activation of store-operated calcium entry channels promotes contraction and proliferation of lung vascular cells. TRPC 4 is a ubiquitously expressed store-operated calcium entry channel, but its role in PAH is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that TRPC 4 promotes pulmonary arterial constriction and occlusive remodeling, leading to right ventricular failure in severe PAH. Severe PAH was induced in Sprague–Dawley rats and in wild-type and TRPC 4 -knockout Fischer 344 rats by a single subcutaneous injection of SU 5416 [SU (<b>semaxanib)</b> ], followed by hypoxia exposure (Hx; 10 % O 2) for 3 weeks and then a return to normoxia (Nx; 21 % O 2) for 3 to 10 additional weeks (SU/Hx/Nx). Although rats of both backgrounds exhibited indistinguishable pulmonary hypertensive responses to SU/Hx/Nx, Fischer 344 rats died within 6 to 8 weeks. Normoxic and hypertensive TRPC 4 -knockout rats recorded hemodynamic parameters {{similar to those of}} their wild-type littermates. However, TRPC 4 inactivation conferred a striking survival benefit, due in part to preservation of cardiac output. Histological grading of vascular lesions revealed a reduction in the density of severely occluded small pulmonary arteries and in the number of plexiform lesions in TRPC 4 -knockout rats. TRPC 4 inactivation therefore provides a survival benefit in severe PAH, associated with a decrease in the magnitude of occlusive remodeling...|$|E

40|$|AbstractMesenchymal {{stem cells}} are potent {{candidates}} in stroke therapy due {{to their ability to}} secrete protective anti-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors. We investigated the neuroprotective effects of human placental mesenchymal-like adherent stromal cells (PLX) using an established ischemic model of nerve growth factor (NGF) -differentiated pheochromocytoma PC 12 cells exposed to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by reperfusion. Under optimal conditions, 2 × 105 PLX cells, added in a trans-well system, conferred 30 – 60 % neuroprotection to PC 12 cells subjected to ischemic insult. PC 12 cell death, measured by LDH release, was reduced by PLX cells or by conditioned medium derived from PLX cells exposed to ischemia, suggesting the active release of factorial components. Since neuroprotection is a prominent function of the cytokine IL- 6 and the angiogenic factor VEGF 165, we measured their secretion using selective ELISA of the cells under ischemic or normoxic conditions. IL- 6 and VEGF 165 secretion by co-culture of PC 12 and PLX cells was significantly higher under ischemic compared to normoxic conditions. Exogenous supplementation of 10 ng/ml each of IL- 6 and VEGF 165 to insulted PC 12 cells conferred neuroprotection, reminiscent of the neuroprotective effect of PLX cells or their conditioned medium. Growth factors as well as co-culture conditioned medium effects were reduced by 70 % and 20 % upon pretreatment with 240 ng/ml <b>Semaxanib</b> (anti VEGF 165) and/or 400 ng/ml neutralizing anti IL- 6 antibody, respectively. Therefore, PLX-induced neuroprotection in ischemic PC 12 cells may be partially explained by IL- 6 and VEGF 165 secretion. These findings may also account for the therapeutic effects seen in clinical trials after treatment with these cells...|$|E
40|$|Localised {{delivery}} of cancer therapy is an approach used {{to overcome the}} serious side effects associated with the systemic treatment of many anticancer drugs which is the main route of administration. Low molecular weight gelators have received great attention {{in recent years as}} a drug delivery strategy for localised targeted therapy. These are small molecules, which self-assemble into a 3 D network fibre via non-covalent interactions to create macroscopically a gel. Studies on this drug delivery platform provide an alternative to the extensively investigated gel delivery systems based on polymers. One of the approaches of low molecular weight gelators is the development of gelators based on anticancer drugs, i. e. self-assembled anticancer prodrug gelators that form a gel. Indeed, there are {{only a limited number of}} studies which investigate the gelation ability of anticancer drugs. Therefore, this project intends to search for an anticancer agent which demonstrates gelation. This has been achieved by preliminary screening of selected members of two categories of cancer treatments which are five benzothiazole-based quinols and four tyrosine kinase inhibitors (sorafenib, linifanib, <b>semaxanib</b> and orantinib). These anticancer drugs have significant anticancer activity but suffer from systemic toxicity. Therefore, the development of LMWGs based on these drugs is a useful approach for localised drug delivery helping improve the toxicity profile. Preliminary screening showed that only linifanib out of the compounds investigated formed gels. Therefore, it was decided to focus on this potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor as the main part in this project. Further characterisation and analysis showed that the urea functional group and the fluorine substitution on the adjacent aromatic ring are key elements in promoting self-assembly. Also, oscillatory rheology showed that linifanib has superior mechanical strength to gels of structurally related analogues. The prodrug approach was then progressed with linifanib to provide more controlled {{delivery of}} the drug. The first library of potential linifanib prodrugs were carbamate derivatives. Unfortunately, all of these compounds failed in inducing gel formation in the preliminary screening regardless of the length and nature of side chain. The second linkage used for creating linifanib prodrugs was the amide conjugation with aliphatic carboxylic acids, single amino acid and dipeptides. With regard to the derivatives with aliphatic carboxylic acid side chain, gels were formed for compounds with clog P between 3. 98 and 4. 72 which means that there is a correlation between hydrophobicity and gel formation. Preliminary screening of dipeptide derivatives of linifanib were negative for all compounds except the proline-proline derivative which formed a gel after 7 days. Stability study in DMSO – water mixtures of these compounds showed that proline-containing dipeptides degraded to linifanib, at a quicker cleavage rate than other compounds, with the highest cleavage rate for the proline-proline analogue. This has led to the conclusion that the gel observed for this analogue was due to the gelation of linifanib. Finally, the single amino acid derivatives gelation screening revealed that the serine analogue of linifanib was the most stable gel. Further characterisation of this compound showed that the formation of gel and its mechanical strength are affected mainly by changes in pH and possibly the buffer composition. The highest mechanical strength was observed with the concentration of 0. 5...|$|E
40|$|To this day, cancer {{remains the}} leading cause of {{mortality}} worldwide 1. A major contributor to cancer progression and metastasis is tumor angiogenesis. The formation of blood vessels around a tumor is facilitated by the complex interplay between cells in the tumor stroma and the surrounding microenvironment. Understanding this interplay and its dynamic interactions is crucial to identify promising targets for cancer therapy. Current methods in cancer research involve the use of two-dimensional (2 D) monolayer cell culture. However, cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions that are important in vascularization and the three-dimensional (3 D) tumor microenvironment cannot accurately be recapitulated in 2 D. To obtain more biologically relevant information, it is essential to mimic the tumor microenvironment in a 3 D culture system. To this end, we demonstrate the utility of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) hydrogels modified for cell-mediated degradability and cell-adhesion to explore, in 3 D, the effect of various tumor microenvironmental features such as cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions, and dimensionality on tumor vascularization and cancer cell phenotype. In aim 1, PEG hydrogels were utilized to evaluate the effect of cells in the tumor stroma, specifically cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), on endothelial cells (ECs) and tumor vascularization. CAFs comprise a majority of the cells in the tumor stroma and secrete factors that may influence other cells in the vicinity such as ECs to promote the organization and formation of blood vessels. To investigate this theory, CAFs were isolated from tumors and co-cultured with HUVECs in PEG hydrogels. CAFs co-cultured with ECs organized into vessel-like structures as early as 7 days and were different in vessel morphology and density from co-cultures with normal lung fibroblasts. In contrast to normal lung fibroblasts (LF), CAFs and ECs organized into vessel-like networks that were structurally similar to vessels found in tumors. This work provides insight on the complex crosstalk between cells in the tumor stroma and their effect on tumor angiogenesis. Controlling this complex crosstalk can provide means for developing new therapies to treat cancer. In aim 2, degradable PEG hydrogels were utilized to explore how extracellular matrix derived peptides modulate vessel formation and angiogenesis. Specifically, integrin-binding motifs derived from laminin such as IKVAV, a peptide derived from the α-chain of laminin and YIGSR, a peptide found in a cysteine-rich site of the laminin β chain, were examined along with RGDS. These peptides were conjugated to heterobifunctional PEG chains and covalently incorporated in hydrogels. The EC tubule formation in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo in response to the laminin-derived motifs were evaluated. Based on these previous aims, in aim 3, PEG hydrogels were optimized to function as a 3 D lung adenocarcinoma in vitro model with metastasis-prone lung tumor derived CAFs, HUVECs, and human lung adenocarcinoma derived A 549 tumor cells. Similar to the complex tumor microenvironment consisting of interacting malignant and non-malignant cells, the PEG-based 3 D lung adenocarcinoma model consists of both tumor and stromal cells that interact together to support vessel formation and tumor cell proliferation thereby more closely mimicking the functional properties of the tumor microenvironment. The utility of the PEG-based 3 D lung adenocarcinoma model as a cancer drug screening platform is demonstrated with investigating the effects of doxorubicin, <b>semaxanib,</b> and cilengitide on cell apoptosis and proliferation. The results from drug screening studies using the PEG-based 3 D in vitro lung adenocarcinoma model correlate with results reported from drug screening studies conducted in vivo. Thus, the PEG-based 3 D in vitro lung adenocarcinoma model may serve as a better tool for identifying promising drug candidates than the conventional 2 D monolayer culture method.
