5|$|Although {{crystallography}} {{can be used}} {{to characterize}} the disorder in an impure or irregular crystal, crystallography generally requires a pure crystal of high regularity to solve the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> complicated arrangement of atoms. Pure, regular crystals can sometimes be obtained from natural or synthetic materials, such as samples of metals, minerals or other macroscopic materials. The regularity of such crystals can sometimes be improved with macromolecular crystal annealing and other methods. However, in many cases, obtaining a diffraction-quality crystal is the chief barrier to solving its atomic-resolution structure.|$|E
5|$|An inscribed stone {{listing the}} gifts {{donated by the}} pharaoh for Abuwtiyuw's funeral was {{discovered}} by Egyptologist George A. Reisner in October 1935.

The white limestone tablet measures 54.2×28.2×23.2cm (21.3×11.1×9.1in). The inscription is composed of ten vertical rows of hieroglyphs, separated by vertical lines.|$|E

5|$|As a manifesto, this {{paragraph}} became {{significant for the}} amalgamation of symphonic and dramatic elements in the same musical composition. Musicologist Hugh MacDonald writes that as Berlioz kept the idea of symphonic construction closely in mind, he allowed the orchestra to express {{the majority of the}} drama in instrumental music and set expository and narrative sections in words. Fellow musicologist Nicholas Temperley suggests that, in Roméo, Berlioz created a model for how a dramatic text could guide the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> choral symphony without circumventing that work from being recognizably a symphony. In this sense, musicologist Mark Evans Bonds writes, the symphonies of Liszt and Mahler owe a debt of influence to Berlioz.|$|E
5|$|Examination of the {{wreckage}} revealed that large portions of the wings' skin were badly glued and {{that a number of}} rib caps and stringers were not glued at all. Many panel pins were not connected to the structure at all and many of the bradawl holes necessary to equalize pressure between the inside of the wing and the outside were missing entirely. The crash of such an advanced aircraft shocked the entire industry and caused a six-month hiatus in design work. Polikarpov overreacted to its loss and built the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> number of his subsequent aircraft stronger, and thus, heavier, than it needed to be. All further work on the project was abandoned following the crash, nominally for lack of a suitable engine.|$|E
5|$|Little says Rosenberg was {{influenced}} by Erich Fromm, George Albee, and George Miller to adopt a community focus in his work, moving away from clinical psychological practice. The central ideas influencing this shift by Rosenberg were that: (1) individual mental health depends on the social <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> community (Fromm), (2) therapists alone are unable to meet the psychological needs of a community (Albee), and (3) knowledge about human behavior will increase if psychology is freely given to the community (Miller).|$|E

5|$|Metalloids usually {{look like}} metals but behave largely like nonmetals. Physically, they are shiny, brittle solids with {{intermediate}} to relatively good electrical conductivity and the electronic band <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> semimetal or semiconductor. Chemically, they mostly behave as (weak) nonmetals, have intermediate ionization energies and electronegativity values, and amphoteric or weakly acidic oxides. They can form alloys with metals. Most of their other {{physical and chemical}} properties are intermediate in nature.|$|E
5|$|Phototrophic archaea use {{light to}} produce {{chemical}} {{energy in the}} form of ATP. In the Halobacteria, light-activated ion pumps like bacteriorhodopsin and halorhodopsin generate ion gradients by pumping ions out of the cell across the plasma membrane. The energy stored in these electrochemical gradients is then converted into ATP by ATP synthase. This process is a form of photophosphorylation. The ability of these light-driven pumps to move ions across membranes depends on light-driven changes in the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> retinol cofactor buried {{in the center of the}} protein.|$|E
5|$|Recently, free {{electron}} lasers {{have been developed}} for use in X-ray crystallography. These are the brightest X-ray sources currently available; with the X-rays coming in femtosecond bursts. The intensity of the source is such that atomic resolution diffraction patterns can be resolved for crystals otherwise too small for collection. However, the intense light source also destroys the sample, requiring multiple crystals to be shot. As each crystal is randomly oriented in the beam, hundreds of thousands of individual diffraction images must be collected {{in order to get a}} complete data-set. This method, serial femtosecond crystallography, has been used in solving the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> number of protein crystal structures, sometimes noting differences with equivalent structures collected from synchrotron sources.|$|E

5|$|Riemannian {{manifolds}} are manifolds whose tangent {{spaces are}} endowed with a suitable inner product.
