Graphite was the material chosen by ORNL because of its low neutron absorption, compatibility with the molten salts, high temperature resistance, and sufficient <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> <b>integrity</b> to separate the fuel and blanket salts. The effect of neutron radiation on graphite is to slowly shrink and then swell the graphite to cause an increase in porosity and a deterioration in physical properties. Graphite pipes would change length, and may crack and leak. ORNL chose not to pursue the two-fluid design, and no examples of the two-fluid reactor were ever constructed.|$|E

The main {{purpose of this study}} is to improve the <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> to determine the optimum resin spread rate for oil palm stem plywood manufacture. The study comprised (1) the establishment of veneer density profile and (2) the effects of resin consumption and lay-up pattern on the <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> bond <b>integrity</b> of the plywood. The method used to determine the veneer density was a standard oven-dry method. The OPS veneer were fabricated into 5 -ply plywood panels using UF (urea formaldehyde) resin adhesive. Three types of OPT veneer were classified which were 100 % from outer veneer, 100 % from inner veneer and mix (2 -ply of outer veneer as face and Three-ply of inner veneer as core material) with four different glue spread rate (250, 300, 350 and 400 g m- 2 ). The results show the veneer density of the OPS can be categorized into three classes: 400 - 500, 300 - 400 and 200 - 300 kg m- 3 . The outer-layer veneers have density between 358 to 442 kg m- 3 , whilst the densities of the inner-layer veneer were 272 to 446 kg m- 3 . Segregating the oil palm veneers by density classes prior to plywood manufacture improved the <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> bond <b>integrity</b> of the OPS plywood greatly...|$|R

40|$|Abstract】With the {{increase}} of elderly population, more and more implant operations need to be performed in osteoporotic bone, while different forms of microdamage will be produced in peri-implant bone intraoperatively, in-cluding high- and low-density diffuse damages, as well as linear cracks. The length and location of the microcracks are the main factors in affecting the biomechanical performance of bone. Suppression of bone remodeling by bisphosphonates may lead to microdamage accumulation, which is often accompanied with the decrease of bone <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> {{the increase}} of bone fragility. Microdamage can be repaired by bone remodeling or mineralization to maintain the <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> structural <b>integrity.</b> Both remo-deling <b>and</b> mineralization can affect the bone quality and long-term implant stability.
