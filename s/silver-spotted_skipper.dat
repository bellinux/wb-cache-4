500|$|The male Lulworth skipper has a {{wingspan}} of , and {{the female}} 25 to 28mm. This makes it one of Britain's smallest butterflies and, in Europe, the smallest member of the Thymelicus genus. Of Britain's five [...] "golden" [...] skippers—the others being the <b>silver-spotted</b> <b>skipper</b> (Hesperia comma), large skipper (Ochlodes sylvanus), small skipper (Thymelicus sylvestris) and Essex skipper (Thymelicus lineola)—the Lulworth is both the smallest and darkest. Beyond its small size, it is distinguished particularly by its dark, dun-coloured wings that appear with tinges of olive-brown; this darkening especially apparent in males.|$|E

50|$|The park {{contains}} {{thousands of}} {{species in the}} life domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. There may be over 200 fungus species in the park, including artist's fungus, black locust shelf fungus, hedge-hog fungus, hen-of-the-woods, pear-shaped puffball, and turkey-tail fungus. Its trees include ashleaf maples, American beeches, American elms, black haws, cottonwoods, eastern redbuds, eastern sycamores, princesstrees, spicebushes, trees-of-heaven, tuliptrees, and white oaks. Its spring ephemerals include spring-beauties and cutleaf toothworts. Other wildflowers in the park are asters, elephant's-foot, wingstem, and yellow jewelweed. Two native plant species that are evidently now extinct in the park are round-lobed hepatica and trailing arbutus. Both ground and climbing forms of poison-ivy are common in Glover Archbold Park. In about 2000, highly pestiferous Asian tiger mosquitoes {{first appeared in the}} park. In 2004, adult 17-year cicadas were common there. A rare harvester butterfly was seen in the park. Some of its other insects are black swallowtails, Chinese mantids, eastern carpenter bees, eastern-tailed blues, eastern tiger swallowtails, Andrena erigeniae bees, false honey ants, impatient bumblebees, imperial moths, monarchs, Peck's skippers, Pennsylvania soldier beetles, sachem <b>skippers,</b> <b>silver-spotted</b> <b>skippers,</b> spicebush swallowtails, spring azures, summer azures, western honey bees, and zebra swallowtails. The park has a significant invasion of nonnative plants, including Asiatic bittersweet, bamboo, common periwinkle, English ivy, garlic-mustard, gill-over-the-ground, Japanese honeysuckle, lesser celandine, wild-garlic, and wintercreeper. Once a 2-foot tall, nonnative, tropical papaya seedling grew in the stream bed. Because people have altered the park's landscape so much, native fish are no longer in the stream. Eastern box turtles, frogs, and toads are rare or extinct in the park, not to mention American black bears, American elk, bison, and timber wolves which once lived in the Washington, D.C. area. Its birds include American robins, barred owls, blue jays, Carolina wrens, catbirds, common crows, fish crows, northern cardinals, northern mockingbirds, and wood thrushes. Mammals in the park include common raccoons, coyotes, domestic cats, domestic dogs, gray foxes, humans, short-tailed shrews, Virginia opossums, white-footed mice, and white-tailed deer.|$|R

50|$|The chalk {{grassland}} here supports large butterfly populations, including very {{large numbers of}} Chalkhill Blue, and a colony of <b>Silver-spotted</b> <b>Skipper.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{butterflies}} Long-tailed Skipper, <b>Silver-spotted</b> <b>Skipper,</b> Marine Blue, Zarucco Duskywing and {{the moth}} Cuphodes wisteriae use Wisteria frutescens as a larval host.|$|E
50|$|Epargyreus clarus, the <b>silver-spotted</b> <b>skipper,</b> is a {{butterfly}} {{of the family}} Hesperiidae. It is {{claimed to be the}} most recognized skipper in North America.|$|E
50|$|The {{reserve is}} home to plants and {{butterflies}} of chalk grassland. The flowers include a number of orchids and the Chiltern gentian; the butterflies include the <b>silver-spotted</b> <b>skipper</b> and the Adonis blue.|$|E
50|$|The adult <b>silver-spotted</b> <b>skipper</b> {{occurs in}} fields, gardens, and at forest edges. It ranges from {{southern}} Canada {{throughout most of}} the United States to northern Mexico; it is absent in the Great Basin and western Texas.|$|E
50|$|The plant {{grows in}} woods, prairies, and {{disturbed}} habitat, such as roadsides. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant. It is a larval host plant for butterflies {{such as the}} eastern tailed-blue, <b>silver-spotted</b> <b>skipper,</b> and hoary edge.|$|E
50|$|The chalk {{grassland}} habitat is particularly attractive to {{many species of}} butterflies such as the Adonis blue, the chalkhill blue, marbled white, <b>silver-spotted</b> <b>skipper,</b> the dark green fritillary, and the silver-washed fritillary. Over 30 species of butterflies have been recorded on the reserve.|$|E
50|$|The site's {{butterfly}} fauna in {{mentioned as}} in its citation sheet. Twenty-five species {{are known to}} breed, including colonies of <b>silver-spotted</b> <b>skipper</b> and Duke of Burgundy, together with comparatively large populations of brown argus, green hairstreak, chalkhill blue, marbled white and dingy skipper.|$|E
5000|$|Hesperia comma, the <b>silver-spotted</b> <b>skipper,</b> is a {{butterfly}} of the Hesperiidae family. It {{is also known}} as the common branded skipper or Holarctic grass skipper in North America, where the butterfly Epargyreus clarus, a spread-winged skipper, also has the common name of [...] "silver-spotted skipper".|$|E
50|$|Concerted {{conservation}} {{efforts in the}} UK, backed by government agencies, have seen this once-threatened species thriving in certain areas. Numbers have increased by some 1500% over the last twenty years; the number of sites has increased from just 68, with 202 new sites established. Conservation schemes have focussed on providing the <b>silver-spotted</b> <b>skipper</b> with suitable habitats, with positive results.|$|E
50|$|Chalk {{grassland}} {{also supports}} a rich fauna, particularly insects. Notable butterfly species include Adonis blue (Lysandra bellargus) and <b>silver-spotted</b> <b>skipper</b> (Hesperia comma) {{which may be}} found on warm, sheltered, south facing slopes. The chalk downland above the Stour Valley is the only British site for the black-veined moth (Siona lineata). Other notable moth species that occur on the North Downs include the fiery clearwing moth (Bembecia chrysidiformis) and the straw belle moth (Aspitates gilvaria).|$|E
50|$|The main chalk {{grassland}} communities are CG4 Brachypodium pinnatum and CG5 Bromus erectus - Brachypodium pinnatum. The reserve supports a rich flora and is notable for its orchids {{which include the}} nationally scarce Burnt Orchid (Neotinea ustulata) and Early Spider Orchid (Ophrys sphegodes). The {{chalk grassland}} is an important site for insects. It is the only site in Kent for the Wart-biter (Decticus verrucivorus) and also supports the <b>Silver-spotted</b> <b>Skipper</b> (Hesperia comma), Adonis Blue (Polyommatus bellargus) and Chalkhill Blue (Polyommatus coridon).|$|E
5000|$|The male Lulworth skipper has a {{wingspan}} of 24 to 27 mm, and {{the female}} 25 to 28 mm.

Of Britain's five [...] "golden" [...] skippers—the others being the <b>silver-spotted</b> <b>skipper</b> (Hesperia comma), large skipper (Ochlodes sylvanus), small skipper (Thymelicus sylvestris) and Essex skipper (Thymelicus lineola)—the Lulworth is both the smallest and darkest. Beyond its small size, it is distinguished particularly by its dark, dun-coloured wings that appear with tinges of olive-brown; this darkening especially apparent in males.|$|E
50|$|Butser Hill SSSI {{has been}} {{proposed}} by the Government as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC), recognising its importance from a European perspective. This {{is due to the}} rich variety of flora and fauna located upon the hill. Butser Hill is in the top twenty Hampshire chalk grassland sites for its rich vascular flora, and is the richest chalk grassland site in Hampshire in terms of its bryophyte (125 species) and lichen (82 species) flora. As well as this, over 30 species of butterfly have been recorded, including populations of Duke of Burgundy and the <b>Silver-spotted</b> <b>Skipper,</b> making the area an important conservation area for many butterfly species.|$|E
50|$|Often {{confused}} with the large skipper Ochlodes venata, this species is easily distinguished by the numerous white spots on the underside hindwings, and {{the tips of the}} upper forewings tend to be darker than those of the large skipper. Also their flight periods rarely overlap; in Britain the large skipper has all but finished when the silver-spotted takes to the wing in August. The <b>silver-spotted</b> <b>skipper</b> prefers warm calcareous sites and has a wide distribution as far south as North Africa, northwards throughout Europe to the Arctic and eastwards across Asia to China and Japan. It also has subspecies in North America. In the UK it is rare and restricted to chalk downlands of southern England.|$|E
50|$|The hill is the Site of Special Scientific Interest and a National Nature Reserve {{managed by}} Natural England. This {{unimproved}} chalk downland {{is home to}} a number of butterfly species, including the Adonis blue, chalkhill blue, common blue, dark green fritillary, Essex skipper, marbled white, meadow brown, <b>silver-spotted</b> <b>skipper,</b> small heath, small skipper, and the speckled wood. There is also a diverse bird population, including the European green woodpecker, commonly seen feeding amongst the many anthills (which are also very important for the lifecycle of the Lycaenidae butterflies) and the turtle dove. Many species of orchid {{can be found on the}} hill or in the immediate vicinity including the fly, bee and frog orchids.|$|E
40|$|The <b>silver-spotted</b> <b>skipper</b> (Epargyreus clarus), {{having become}} {{increasingly}} more destructive to Maryland Eastern Shore soybeans, is being studied {{as a candidate}} for biocontrol. Nordin (1975) described a possible viral pathogen isolated from a decayed skipper. Without a clear knowledge of the micro-flora population of a live insect it is difficult to conclude, from the presence of a microorganism on a dead insect, that a pathogen exists, since numerous species of bacteria multiply rapidly in dead insects...|$|E
