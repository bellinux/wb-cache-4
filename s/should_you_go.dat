6000|$|... "Why {{should he}} be turned out? Why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> not <b>go</b> to him? <b>You</b> love him;--and as for him, he is more in love than any man I ever knew. Go to Plaistow Hall, and {{everything}} will run smooth." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> alone?" [...] I asked. [...] "We might {{remain in}} a body, and thus save just so much time. If one can do the trick, then may it be {{possible}} for two, or a dozen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In what way?" [...] she demanded. [...] "I judge {{only by the}} facts, {{the things}} you have said to me, your accusations against Captain Granet. Why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> out of your way to {{investigate}} cases of suspected espionage?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It's all {{nonsense}} your going away, you know," [...] he said {{a little}} awkwardly. [...] "You can't wonder that I am surprised.
