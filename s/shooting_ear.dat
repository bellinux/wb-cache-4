40|$|The {{temporal}} {{expression of}} two major antioxidant gene-enzyme systems, catalases and superoxide dismutases, has been characterized in the husk leaf, silk, pistillate flower, whole kernel, and cob of the maize <b>ear</b> <b>shoot.</b> The catalase activity, CAT- 2 and CAT- 3 protein levels, and the steady-state mRNA levels {{of each of the}} three Cat genes reveal differential expression of these transcripts in tissues of the <b>ear</b> <b>shoot.</b> Although Call and Cat 3 expression is observed in all the aforementioned tissues, Cat 2 expression is detected only at the late stages of whole kernel maturation. Because silk exhibits the same pattern of Cat gene expression as the pericarp, and both tissues share an identical histological origin, catalase gene expression might be associated with cell lineage.

The phloem-immobile Sr flowed mainly to the leaf lamina and to the glumes via the xylem. The Sr transport was not sensitive to steam-girdling. In contrast, the phloem-mobile Rb accumulated during the incubation time mainly in the stem and the leaf sheath. The Rb transport to the grains was impaired by steam-girdling {{as well as by}} elevated Ni and Co concentrations in the incubation solution indicating that Rb was transported via the phloem to the maturing grains and that this transport was affected by the heavy metals.

Three doses of the regulators IAA, MH, GA 3, eee, Ethrel and Kinetine were used. Each plant reeeíved four applications of the hormonal treatment at the following development stages: Tassel diferentiation, <b>ear</b> <b>shoot</b> diferentiation, tassel emergence and silk emergence. The regulator capacity to induce increment {{on the development of the}} second, third and fourth <b>ear</b> <b>shoots</b> in the prolific corn as well as on the second and third <b>ear</b> <b>shoot</b> of the non prolific corn was studied. In the two genotypes "secundary" <b>ear</b> <b>shoots</b> were completely developpedwhich were diferenciated on the peduncule of the main <b>ear</b> <b>shoot.</b> The general effect was an increment of the prolificity as follows: In the MB 510 corn: IAA (100 ppm) resulted in an increment of 0. 82; MH (100 ppm), 0. 85; GA 3 (600 ppm), 1. 13; eee (200 ppm), 0. 65; Ethrel (100 ppm), 0. 33 <b>ear</b> <b>shoots</b> per planto In the MB 513 corn: IAA (200) increased 0. 66; Ethrel (500 ppm), 0. 39; GA 3,(30 ppm) 0. 66 ear shootsper planto The vaious treatments also modified the grain numbers per plant 'and the accumulation of biomass in them. However, the absense of signifíeance in the mayority of results is believed to be related to the degree of regularity in the plant responses to the various treatments or, perhps a redistribution of the accumulated matter among the grainsand the formed <b>ear</b> <b>shoots</b> took place without a sígníficant increase of accumulated dry matter. It is possible to assume that the similar responses to different treatments are related to the modífícation that those treatments could have produced on the auxin content of the plant. Con el propósito de determinar los efectos de diferentes reguladores sobre el crecimiento y desarrollo de mazorcas en el maíz prolífico MB 510 y en el no prolífico MB 513, se realizaron cuatro ensayos bajo un diseño de bloques completos al azar, con tres réplicas. Se emplearon tres concentraciones de: AIA e HM; AG 3 y CCC; Ethrel y Kinetina. Las plantas recibieron cuatro aplicaciones del tratamiento hormonal respectivo, en las edades en las que se efectuaban: La diferenciación de la espiga, diferenciación de mazorcas, emergencia de la espiga y pistilos respectivamente. En la mayoría de los ensayos se comprobó la capacidad de los reguladores para aumentar el número de mazorcas desarrolladas totalmente como fueron: la segunda, tercera y cuarta en el maíz prolífico y la segunda y tercera en el no prolífico. En ambos genotipos se desarrollaron mazorcas "secundarias" diferenciadas sobre el pedúnculo de las mazorcas principales. El efecto general fue el incremento del grado de prolificidad, así: en MB 510, AlA (100 ppm), aumentó 0. 82; HM (100 ppm), 0. 85; AG 3 (600 ppm), 1. 13; CCC (200 ppm), 0. 65; Ethrel+(100 ppm), 0. 33 mazorcas por planta. En MB 513, AlA (200 ppm), aumentó 0. 66; AG 3 (30 ppm), 0. 66; Ethrel (500 ppm), 0. 39 mazorcas por planta. Los diferentes tratamientos también modificaron el número de granos por planta y la acumulación de biomasa en ellos. Sin embargo, la falta de signíficancía en la mayoría de los resultados, se relaciona con la regularidad en las respuestas de las plantas a los tratamientos o que quizá se presentó una redistribución de los asimilados entre el total de los granos y mazorcas formadas sin que se incrementara significativamente la materia seca en ellos acumulada. Tal vez, las respuestas similares obtenidas con los diferentes tratamientos se relacionan con la modificación que estos últimos pudieron haber ejercido sobre el contenido de auxina en las plantas. ...|$|R

The plants were grown with no wa-ter or nutrient restrictions. Results showed that earlier thinning was associated with greater stem, leaf, <b>shoot</b> and <b>ear</b> dry weight accumulation, ear kernel weight (EKW) and kernel number per ear row (KNER). In this ways the greatest of these characteristics were obtained in thinning at sowing i. e. 6. 67 plants m- 2 throughout. Delay in thinning un-til the 12 -leaf stage reduced stem dry weight and EKW significantly. Thinning at tasseling also resulted in significantly lower stem dry weight accumulation compared to thinning at sowing. At final harvest, the stem dry weight of plants thinned at tasseling was 20. 47 % (P< 0. 05) lower than those thinned at sowing. Similar effects were found upon delay in thinning until tasseling on leaf, <b>shoot,</b> and <b>ear</b> dry weight accumulation. Delay in thinning until the 12 -leaf stage or later, also reduced EKW significantly compared to plants thinned at sowing. This reduction was attributable to decreased KNER and 1000 -kernel weight.

40|$|Although millet {{is known}} to be adapted to very dry conditions, little is known about its canopy water relations. The control of water loss and {{dehydration}} tolerance were studied during the grain filling for two cultivars presumed resistant and sensitive to moisture deficit at this stage. Two experiments were conducted in the dry hot season at Niamey, using crops based on the traditional system of hill sowing at low density : a preliminary trial with low leaf area (index of 0. 7 at flowering); and a main trial with higher leaf area (index of 1. 8) induced by tillering where parameters were recorded at a short time scale. The preliminary trial with small initial leaf area revealed a less apparent leaf water deficit according to leaf water potential and stomatal regulation but the main results were in agreement with those of the main trial. The cultivars were similar in their water relations. During drought, water losses declined quickly due essentially to a large decrease in the green leaf area through senescence. The potential effect of stomatal regulation was reduced by a natural decline of 50 % after earing. The water deficit was relatively small and osmotic adjustement was absent in the upper leaves of <b>eared</b> <b>shoots,</b> which stayed green. These results reveal for millet, that rapid control of leaf area by senescence is the predominant mechanism at this stage, inducing long-term avoidance of dehydration of the upper leaves on <b>eared</b> <b>shoots.</b> The quick adjustment of canopy conductance to the reduction of soil water availability is an hypothesis advanced.

40|$|ABSTRACT This article {{presents}} an algorithm for performing {{early detection of}} disease outbreaks by searching a database of emergency department cases for anomalous patterns. Traditional techniques for anomaly detection are unsatisfactory for this problem because they identify individual data points that are rare due to particular combinations of features. Thus, these traditional algorithms discover isolated outliers of particularly strange events, such as someone accidentally <b>shooting</b> their <b>ear,</b> that are not indicative of a new outbreak. Instead, {{we would like to}} detect groups with specific characteristics that have a recent pattern of illness that is anomalous relative to historical patterns. We propose using an anomaly detection algorithm that would characterize each anomalous pattern with a rule. The significance of each rule would be carefully evaluated using the Fisher exact test and a randomization test. In this study, we compared our algorithm with a standard detection algorithm by measuring the number of false positives and the timeliness of detection. Simulated data, produced by a simulator that creates the effects of an epidemic on a city, were used for evaluation. The results indicate that our algorithm has significantly better detection times for common significance thresholds while having a slightly higher false positive rate...|$|R

A pot experiment at the Plant Environment Laboratory, The University of Reading, UK, in 1996 examined whether wheat cultivars differ {{in response to}} these stresses, if any stage during reproductive development was more sensitive than another, and whether the effects of B deficiency and cold temperature were reversible. The experiment comprised a full four-factor combination of two cultivars of spring wheat with different field responses to B and cold temperature (Annapurna- 3 and NL- 683), three B treatments (no B added, 20 ?M B L? 1 from sowing to maturity and 20 ?M B L? 1 from flag leaf first visible (GS 37) to maturity), two temperature regimes (ambient UK temperatures and 8 ?/ 2 ?C day/night temperatures in growth cabinets), and three stages for different temperature regimes to be applied [flag leaf ligule visible (GS 39) to awn first visible (GS 49), from GS 49 to full ear emergence (GS 59) or from GS 59 to the completion of anthesis (GS 69) ]. Control plants remained outdoors throughout. An additional B treatment was also applied in which 20 ?M B L? 1 was supplied only until GS 37 without any cold treatments. NL- 683 was more sensitive to cold temperature, producing > 80 % sterility, than Annapurna- 3 (40 % sterility). In contrast, Annapurna- 3 was more susceptible to B deficiency (22 % sterility compared to only 14 % in NL- 683). The principal effect of cold was to impair pollen viability: anthers were poorly developed, small, shrivelled and rarely dehisced. More than 75 % of pollen grains were dead in NL- 683 compared to about 25 % in Annapurna- 3. All periods from GS 39 to GS 69 were vulnerable to cold damage although the first stage (GS 39 ? 49) was relatively more sensitive. The adverse effect of cold was irreversible even if ear emergence and anthesis of the stressed plants was in ambient temperatures. Cold temperature significantly reduced the response of plants to B and when cold stressed the cold susceptible cultivar (NL- 683) accumulated less B. The effect of added B in terms of improved fertility was smaller in the main <b>shoot</b> <b>ear</b> but the fertility of tillers was greatly enhanced. Plants were more responsive to added B after the emergence of the penultimate leaf: the interruption of B supply during this stage led to a similar degree of sterility, as in plants grown without B throughout. However, resupply of B at this stage in the plants initially grown without B led to similar B concentrations and grain set as in plants grown with adequate B throughout. Boron concentrations in the flag leaf and ear also increased considerably from GS 39 to GS 60 indicating that these are the most sensitive stages for B nutrition and wheat plants can recover all of their B requirements if supply is not restricted from GS 37 onwards.

40|$|Head smut {{caused by}} Sphacelotheca reiliana (S. reiliana) is a devastating disease of maize {{that has been}} {{reported}} to account for up to 80 % yield loss in fields. This disease exists in many major maize growing regions and the disease incidence is rising. It has become a major constraint in seed production areas as the spores it produces adhere to and contaminate seeds. The fungus infects systemically during the seedling stage and usually does not produce symptoms until the plant reaches its reproductive stages when the fungus replaces the inflorescences with large black masses of teliospores known as sori. When the sori rupture spores contaminate soil and seed which will then serve as a source of inoculum and a dispersal unit for the fungus. Disease management options include host resistance and fungicidal seed treatments but both of these strategies need improvement; resistance in most commercial hybrids is not complete and more seed treatments need to be tested for efficacy against this disease. The strategies for evaluating both of these options require considerable time expenditure, as the plant does not show symptoms of infection throughout the growing season. With this in mind a seedling assay for the evaluation of host resistance and seed treatment efficacy would be advantageous. A seedling assay was developed using two novel inoculation techniques to consistently and efficiently infect maize seedlings with S. reiliana. Seeds were planted in a growth chamber under controlled conditions that were conducive to infection. Presence of the fungus within seedling tissue was detected by a sensitive and specific real-time polymerase chain reaction. Seed inoculation provided more consistent results than soil infestation. Five commercially available fungicidal seed treatments were tested for their efficacy against head smut infection, using the seedling assay. Infection rates of inoculated, mock-treated controls varied between 60 - 80 % Incidence of infection. Tebuconazole, fludioxonil and sedaxane seed treatments reduced incidence of seedling infection by S. reiliana (p= 0. 01) whereas azoxystrobin did not. Three rates, representing the ranges of rates on the product labels of both tebuconazole and sedaxane, were also tested. No differences in seedling infection were detected among the rates (p= 0. 01). Sedaxane (0. 1 mg*seed- 1) eliminated detectable seedling infection when teliospores of S. reiliana were applied at a rate of 10 spores*seed- 1. The assay was effective for seed treatment efficacy testing and can be a useful tool to screen experimental fungicides for their efficacy against head smut. The seedling assay was used to evaluate five maize inbred lines for their ability to resist infection by S. reiliana. Inbreds included A 619, B 68, B 73, Mo 17 and Va 26. Mo 17 had lower incidence of infection compared to the other four inbreds (p= 0. 01) but no other significant differences between inbreds were detected. We also evaluated maize tissue from a susceptible hybrid in field trials (in California and Texas) with inoculated seed and non-inoculated seed planted into S. reiliana infested soil. Seedling and <b>ear</b> <b>shoot</b> tests showed that S. reiliana DNA was present at rates as high as 54 % of seedlings in Texas and 11 % in California and 30 % of <b>ear</b> <b>shoots</b> in Texas and 8 % in California; despite these rates of infection no symptoms were observed by field scouting. This assay may be useful to compare initial infection of among maize genotypes, but the lack of symptom development indicates that seedling and <b>ear</b> <b>shoot</b> infection are not predictive of disease incidence. A high percentage of maize plants infected with S. reiliana may not exhibit any symptoms and this knowledge is important for designing management strategies. Further work is needed to better understand the implications of this result on the epidemiology of this disease and the mechanisms for resistance...|$|R

After several close calls, Mike, who is also Ferguson's bodyguard, discovers their whereabouts when he spots a pair of boots that Rose had stolen from his dead partner. Tony is ambushed in the bathroom and nearly drowned in the bathtub by Mike, but he turns the tables and accidentally <b>shoots</b> Mike's <b>ear</b> off before the three of them escape the hotel. Ferguson and Mike pursue them in a high-speed chase through the streets of London until Mike loses control and crashes the car, sending the pair to the hospital.|$|R
40|$|We have {{examined}} the expression of three alternative oxidase (aox) genes in two types of maize mitochondrial mutants. Nonchromosomal stripe (NCS) mutants carry mitochondrial DNA deletions that affect subunits of respiratory complexes and show constitutively defective growth. Cytoplasmic male-sterile (CMS) mutants have mitochondrial DNA rearrangements, but they are impaired for mitochondrial function only during anther development. In contrast to normal plants, which have very low levels of AOX, NCS mutants exhibit high expression of aox genes in all nonphotosynthetic tissues tested. The expression pattern is specific {{for each type of}} mitochondrial lesion: the NADH dehydrogenase–defective NCS 2 mutant has high expression of aox 2, whereas the cytochrome oxidase–defective NCS 6 mutant predominantly expresses aox 3. Similarly, aox 2 and aox 3 can be induced differentially in normal maize seedlings by specific inhibitors of these two respiratory complexes. Translation-defective NCS 4 plants show induction of both aox 2 and aox 3. AOX 2 and AOX 3 proteins differ in their ability to be regulated by reversible dimerization. CMS mutants show relatively high levels of aox 2 mRNAs in young tassels but none in <b>ear</b> <b>shoots.</b> Significant expression of aox 1 is detected only in NCS and CMS tassels. The induction pattern of maize aox genes could serve as a selective marker for diverse mitochondrial defects...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to explore systemic infection by the Aspergillus flavus group into corn ears via the stalk. An A. parasiticus mutant which produces norsolorinic (NOR) acid (a visible orange intermediate of the aflatoxin biosynthetic pathway) was used in field studies to monitor systemic infection of corn stalk and ear tissues. Corn hybrids resistant and susceptible to aflatoxin contam-ination were grown in the field and inoculated prior to tasseling by inserting A. parasiticus infested tooth-picks into stalks between the 5 th and 6 th node below the lowest <b>ear</b> <b>shoot.</b> Beginning 2 weeks after inoc-ulation, systemic infection by the NOR mutant was assessed weekly by collecting ear shank tissue and stalk tissue from the nodes between the infection sites and the developing ears. Ears were collected {{at the end of the}} growing season to determine the level of kernel infection by the NOR mutant. In two separate studies, the A. parasiticus NOR mutant was isolated from stalk tissues at all of node positions and ear shank tissue from several susceptible corn hybrid plants at the first harvest date 2 weeks after inocu-lation. The NOR mutant was also isolated from stalk and ear tissue of a resistant hybrid. The NOR mutant was only isolated from kernels of susceptible hybrids in 2003 and 2004. Infection rates of kernels in infected ears were very low (...|$|R

[...] He had high black boots (mostly outside the trousers) and a decorated sombrero, a black shirt - neither blue nor red - although most drawings show a white shirt (on the Scandinan covers blue), with a black (sometimes shown as red or blue) silk scarf or a red tie. He also had a broad black silk belt (sometimes illustrated as a red silk one - although mostly as an American brown belt), plus two holstered revolvers hanging low on a [...] "double" [...] ammunition belt. Some illustrations show only one revolver with ammunition belt and holster - others two revolvers on one holster. He also had a knife - and a rifle, a lasso and a Mexican sarape on his horse - and he wore gloves. The mask covered more of his upper face than shown {{on most of the}} fine drawings by Francisco Batet (and especially by several others). The Scandinavian covers presented a relatively large mask (illustrated by Harald Damsleth).

40|$|Objetivando avaliar a viabilidade agronômica e econômica da associação inhame e milho doce, foi desenvolvido um trabalho em área da horta de pesquisas da Universidade Federal de Viçosa, em sistema de consórcio (associação aditiva), utilizando-se inhame (Colocasia esculenta) 'Chinês' como cultura {{principal}} e milho doce (Zea mays) 'Doce Cristal' como cultura contrastante. O inhame foi plantado em sulcos de 12 cm de profundidade, no espaçamento de 100 x 30 cm, e o milho doce em covas de 3 cm de profundidade, na fileira de plantio, entre as plantas de inhame, 40 dias após plantio do inhame. O delineamento experimental foi de blocos ao acaso, com quatro repetições, no esquema fatorial (3 x 2) + 2 (três arranjos de plantas: uma planta de milho a cada 30 cm; duas plantas de milho a cada 60 cm e três plantas de milho a cada 90 cm x dois manejos das plantas de milho: sem e com corte e retirada da parte aérea das plantas de milho no momento da colheita das espigas verdes + dois controles: monoculturas de inhame e de milho doce). Foram avaliadas características de crescimento e de produção das culturas, além dos índices de eficiência dos consórcios. As duas espécies são adequadas para plantio em sistema de consórcio. O arranjo com uma planta de milho a cada 30 cm propiciou maiores produtividades e índices de eficiência dos consórcios. Com exceção do arranjo com três plantas de milho/cova a cada 90 cm com corte da parte aérea das plantas de milho na colheita das espigas, no qual ocorreram menores índices de eficiência dos consórcios e rendimento financeiro total inferior ao da monocultura do inhame, as demais associações estudadas demonstraram-se viáveis agronômica e economicamente. An {{experiment was}} conducted to evaluate some crop production characteristics and economic viability of intercropping systems using taro (Colocasia esculenta) 'Chinês', as major crop, and sweet corn (Zea mays) 'Doce Cristal' as minor crop. Taro corms were planted in 12 -cm-deep furrows in a 100 x 30 cm spacing. Sweet corn seeds were sowed in the row between the taro plants 40 days after the main crop planting. Corn plants were distributed in three arrays, as follows: one corn plant 30 cm apart; two corn plants 60 cm apart, and three corn plants 90 cm apart; and two growing systems (with and without removing the corn <b>shoot</b> when the <b>ears</b> were harvested at 110 days after sowing - soft kernel stage), comprising six treatments of intergrown and two control treatments (i. e., single crops). The experiments were organized in four random blocks, in a factorial array design (3 x 2) + 2 (three distribution of plants: one corn plant 30 cm apart; two corn plants 60 cm apart, and three corn plants 90 cm apart by two systems of corn growth: with and without removal of <b>shoot</b> when the <b>ears</b> were harvested + two control: single crop of either taro or sweet corn). Data for plant growth, production and the efficiency for the different planting systems arrays were collected. Both crops were suitable for intergrowing systems. Higher values for crop production and intergrowing efficiency index were obtained in treatment with one corn plant 30 cm apart. Lower intergrowing efficiency index and economical return were observed in the treatment where each three corn plants were 90 cm apart and shoots were removed just after the harvest at the soft kernel stage. The others intercrop systems were both agronomically and economically viable...|$|R

30|$|In 2009, maize (Zea mays L. cv. Yumeno-corn) was {{cultivated}} {{in the long-term}} fertilizer experimental field. This field was established in 1914, and five fertilizer treatments, complete fertilization (+NPK), without N (−N), without P (−P), without K (−K), and no fertilization (−NPK, started in 1921), have been continuously applied for 95  years. The cultivation history of the field is described in Additional file 1 : Table S 1. N, P, and K fertilizers were applied as ammonium sulfate, superphosphate, and potassium sulfate, respectively (100  kg N, P 2 O 5, K 2 O ha− 1), once before sowing. Each plot was 5.25  ×  18.5  m in size, and the soil type was classified as a brown lowland soil (Haplic Fluvisols). General properties of the field soils were shown elsewhere (Cheng et al. 2013). Seeds of maize were sown on May 27 and plant <b>shoots</b> (leaf, stem, <b>ear,</b> and flower) were sampled on July 23 at the early flowering stage with 3 replications from at least 3 plants each. The row and hill spacing was 50  ×  50  cm. After determination of fresh weight of shoots, leaves were separated from shoots, dried in an oven at 70  °C for 72  h, weighed, and ground with a vibrating sample mill (TI- 100; CMT, Saitama, Japan) for mineral analysis. Soil samples were collected with 3 replications after harvest (September 18) from at least 5 points each (0 – 15  cm) and mixed in each replication. Although plant and soil samples were collected at different times because of various reasons in cultivation, seasonal variations in available concentration of minerals, except for N, P and K, in soils were negligible (data not shown). Soil samples were dried at room temperature and passed through a sieve with round holes of 2 -mm diameter for mineral analysis.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} in the context of ideotype breeding, and was pan of a major project which has as a main objective the development of a maize ideotype adapted to conditions of high temperature and low moisture. A previous research culminated in the description of the plant model; it called for important morphological modifications, but the most prominent involved the transfer of the site of grain production from a lateral position to the apex of the plant, associated with the complete suppression of the tassel. A mutant was also identified as a potential source to develop the ideotype. To decide on the suitability of this genetic material, several experiments were designed to characterize its morphology and to obtain information on the genetic nature of the different plant attributes associated with it;In average, the typical mutant plant was 85 cm tall, with 27 to 30 leaves from which 18 to 20 remained functional at maturity. It developed one or more apical female inflorescences; a tassel was usually present although suppressed at variable degrees. Ears were small, with few rows and gram. Gram yield per plain was low (+/- 30 g). Lateral <b>ear</b> <b>shoots</b> frequently appeared. Little improvement in the level of expression of these plant attributes was accomplished after backcrossing, possibly because of an undesirable linkage between the presence of apical ears and a short, leafy plant;Preliminary evidence suggested that the apical ear characteristic may be a threshold trait. Generation mean analysis indicated that penetrance of the trait was controlled by additive, dominance, additive x additive and additive x dominance gene effects. Models including one to three digenic epistatic effects explained the inheritance of other plant attributes. Information from a biparental progenies experiment revealed that in the population derived from the maintenance of the mutant, genetic variation existed for most traits, although its magnitude was small;It is concluded that some selection could be practiced in the mutant population, but that the most recommendable course of action is to continue with the backcross process and to explore new germplasm sources...|$|R
