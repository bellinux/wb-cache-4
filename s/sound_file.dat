Love Hina Original <b>Sound</b> <b>File</b> was released on September 21, 2000 and contains all of the background music for the series {{as well as many}} vocal songs. Love Hina— Winter Special Soundtrack was released on January 24, 2001 and was followed by Love Hina— Spring Special Soundtrack on June 6, 2001. Love Hina Again Soundtrack was released on April 3, 2002. Two collections of vocal songs featuring the female cast members were released: Love Hina – Hinata Girls Song Best was released on March 16, 2001 and Love Hina – Hinata Girls Song Best 2 was released on October 3, 2001. Many of the songs featured on these two albums were written by Ritsuko Okazaki, who released the self cover album Love Hina Okazaki Collection on December 16, 2001. Two live concerts called Love Live Hina were performed by the Japanese cast members. The Tokyo Bay performance was bundled on DVD with Love Hina Final Selection, and the Osaka Performance was available separately.|$|E

500|$|Final Fantasy X {{features}} {{innovations in}} the rendering of characters' facial expressions, achieved through motion capture and skeletal animation technology. This technology allowed animators to create realistic lip movements, {{which were then}} programmed to match the speech of the game's voice actors. Nojima has revealed that the inclusion of voice acting enabled him to express emotion more powerfully than before, and he was therefore {{able to keep the}} storyline simple. He also said that the presence of voice actors led him to make various changes to the script, in order to match the voice actors' personalities with the characters they were portraying. The inclusion of voice, however, led to difficulties. With the game's cutscenes already programmed around the Japanese voice work, the English localization team faced the difficulty of establishing English-oriented dialogue and the obstacle of incorporating this modified wording with the rhythm and timing of the characters' lip movements. Localization specialist Alexander O. Smith noted that they had to keep the localized <b>sound</b> <b>file</b> within the duration of the original Japanese, as longer files would cause the game to crash. He described the process of fitting natural-sounding English speech into the game as [...] "something akin to writing four or five movies' worth of dialogue entirely in haiku form [...] of course the actors had to act, and act well, within those restraints." ...|$|E

YTMND is generally a humor website, owing its tone and culture to the original YTMND and its early imitators. Other YTMNDs, however, are artistic or political.|$|E
2500|$|The music {{system in}} San Andreas is {{enhanced}} from previous titles.

This system would be used in Grand Theft Auto IV. WCTR, rather than featuring licensed music and DJs, features spoken word performances by actors such as Andy Dick performing as talk show hosts and listener callers in a parody of talk radio programming.|$|E

In the March 2006 issue of Stuff magazine, there is a mention of the original [...] "You're the Man Now Dog" [...] website. YTMND was again mentioned in the magazine in June 2006 when a link to timetraveler.ytmnd.com was printed. In May, Current TV host and producer Max Lugavere was spotted wearing a YTMND T-shirt on the network. In the August 2006 issue of WIRED, an article under the [...] "Expert" [...] column by the name of [...] "1 Web Site, 250,000 Idiotic Clips. LOL!" [...] was printed. In the article, five of Goldberg's favorite YTMNDs (You're the Man Now, Dog; Vader Coaster; Lohan Facial; LOL Internet; Blue Ball Machine) were mentioned, along with commentary from Max himself for each one. [...] The article's writer, James Lee, can be quoted as saying [...] "Repeat an image loop and a <b>sound</b> <b>file</b> – as 24-year-old Max Goldberg with You're the Man Now, Dog – and pretty soon you'll have 4 million visitors a month and 120,000 contributors uploading their own clips."

A name is univocal, or applied univocally, with respect to all things of which it can be predicated in the same sense; it is æquivocal, or applied æquivocally, as respects those things {{of which it is}} predicated in different senses. It is scarcely necessary to give instances of a fact so familiar as the double meaning of a word. In reality, as has been already observed, an æquivocal or ambiguous word is not one name, but two names, accidentally coinciding in <b>sound.</b> <b>File</b> meaning a steel instrument, and file meaning a line of soldiers, have no more title to be considered one word, because written alike, than grease and Greece have, because they are pronounced alike.
