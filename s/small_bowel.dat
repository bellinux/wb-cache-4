5|$|Gastroenteritis {{is defined}} as {{vomiting}} or diarrhea due to infection of the small or large bowel. The changes in the <b>small</b> <b>bowel</b> are typically noninflammatory, while {{the ones in the}} large bowel are inflammatory. The number of pathogens required to cause an infection varies from as few as one (for Cryptosporidium) to as many as 108 (for Vibrio cholerae).|$|E
5|$|Turbinellus floccosus is {{poisonous}} to {{some people}} who eat it, but has been consumed without incident by others. Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea may occur, though are sometimes delayed by up to 8–14 hours. A tricarboxylic acid known as α-tetradecylcitric acid {{may be responsible for}} the extreme gastrointestinal symptoms. Laboratory experiments showed it increased tone of guinea pig smooth muscle of the <b>small</b> <b>bowel</b> (ileum), and that when given to rats, it led to mydriasis, skeletal muscle weakness, and central nervous system depression. Turbinellus floccosus contains more than double the amount of this acid than the related T. kauffmanii.|$|E
5|$|Serum copper is low, {{which may}} seem {{paradoxical}} given that Wilson's {{disease is a}} disease of copper excess. However, 95% of plasma copper is carried by ceruloplasmin which is often low in Wilson's disease. Urine copper is elevated in Wilson's disease and is collected for 24 hours in a bottle with a copper-free liner. Levels above 100 μg/24h (1.6 μmol/24h) confirm Wilson's disease, and levels above 40 μg/24h (0.6 μmol/24h) are strongly indicative. High urine copper levels are not unique to Wilson's disease; they are sometimes observed in autoimmune hepatitis and in cholestasis (any disease obstructing the flow of bile from the liver to the <b>small</b> <b>bowel).</b>|$|E
30|$|We report here {{a case of}} PCI in an 88 -year-old {{man with}} a {{provisional}} diagnosis of perforated viscus and possible ischaemic bowels based on CT findings of pneumoperitoneum. The patient {{was found to have}} extensive PCI on his <b>small</b> <b>bowels.</b> We then systematically search the PubMed database for case reports for articles containing ‘pneumatosis intestinalis’ in their titles or key words.|$|R
50|$|A low-fiber/low-residue diet is a diet whose goal is {{fewer and}} <b>smaller</b> <b>bowel</b> {{movements}} each day. The diet {{may be used}} as part of the bowel preparation before a diagnostic procedure such as colonoscopy or as a short-term therapy for acute stages of gastrointestinal illnesses such as Crohn's Disease, diverticulitis, bowel obstruction, and ulcerative colitis. In addition, a low-fiber diet is often prescribed before and/or after abdominal surgery or cancer treatments.|$|R
50|$|The {{inflammatory}} process, {{mediated by}} T cells, leads to {{disruption of the}} structure and function of the <b>small</b> <b>bowel's</b> mucosal lining and causes malabsorption as it impairs the body's ability to absorb nutrients, minerals, and fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K from food. Lactose intolerance may be present due to the decreased bowel surface and reduced production of lactase but typically resolves once the condition is treated.|$|R
5|$|Copper {{enters the}} body through the {{digestive}} tract. A transporter protein on {{the cells of}} the <b>small</b> <b>bowel,</b> copper membrane transporter 1 (Ctr1; SLC31A1), carries copper inside the cells, where some is bound to metallothionein and part is carried by ATOX1 to an organelle known as the trans-Golgi network. Here, in response to rising concentrations of copper, an enzyme called ATP7A releases copper into the portal vein to the liver. Liver cells also carry the CMT1 protein, and metallothionein and ATOX1 bind it inside the cell, but here it is ATP7B that links copper to ceruloplasmin and releases it into the bloodstream, as well as removing excess copper by secreting it into bile. Both functions of ATP7B are impaired in Wilson's disease. Copper accumulates in the liver tissue; ceruloplasmin is still secreted, but in a form that lacks copper (termed apoceruloplasmin) and is rapidly degraded in the bloodstream.|$|E
5|$|Homozygous FH {{is harder}} to treat. The LDL receptors are {{minimally}} functional, if at all. Only high doses of statins, often {{in combination with other}} medications, are modestly effective in improving lipid levels. If medical therapy is not successful at reducing cholesterol levels, LDL apheresis may be used; this filters LDL from the bloodstream in a process reminiscent of dialysis. Very severe cases may be considered for a liver transplant; this provides a liver with normally functional LDL receptors, and leads to rapid improvement of the cholesterol levels, but at the risk of complications from any solid organ transplant (such as rejection, infections, or side-effects of the medication required to suppress rejection). Other surgical techniques include partial ileal bypass surgery, in which part of the <b>small</b> <b>bowel</b> is bypassed to decrease the absorption of nutrients and hence cholesterol, and portacaval shunt surgery, in which the portal vein is connected to the vena cava to allow blood with nutrients from the intestine to bypass the liver.|$|E
5|$|LeMond {{had planned}} to defend his title in the 1987 Tour de France with La Vie Claire, but {{he was unable to}} participate. Earlier that year, while riding in the Tirreno–Adriatico spring tune-up race, LeMond fell and {{fractured}} his left wrist. He returned to the United States to recover from the injury. The week before returning to Europe, he went turkey hunting on a ranch co-owned by his father in Lincoln, California – in the Sacramento Valley of Northern California. LeMond was with Rodney Barber and Patrick Blades, his uncle and brother-in-law. The trio had become separated when Blades, who heard movement behind him, turned and fired through a bush. The movement had come from LeMond, who was hit in his back and right side with a devastating blast of approximately 60 No. 2-sized pellets. LeMond's injuries were life-threatening, but fortunately, a police helicopter was already airborne near the scene and transported LeMond on a 15-minute air medical flight to the Medical Center at University of California-Davis. LeMond was taken for emergency surgery. He had suffered a pneumothorax to his right lung and extensive bleeding, having lost some 65 percent of his blood volume. A physician informed LeMond later that he had been within 20 minutes of bleeding to death. The operation saved his life, but four months later he developed a <b>small</b> <b>bowel</b> obstruction due to adhesions that had formed following the shooting. He underwent another surgery to relieve the obstruction and take down the adhesions. Concerned that his team would drop him if they knew the shooting accident required a second surgery, LeMond asked the surgeons to remove his appendix at the same time. He then informed his team that he had had his appendix removed, {{but the rest of the}} story was left somewhat vague. The events effectively ended his 1987 season, and in October he announced he would return to serious competition the following February, with the Dutch PDM team.|$|E
30|$|Measurement of SBL is a {{very common}} {{practice}} in abdominal surgery and sometimes surgeons do repeated SBL measurements to be clearer on the exact bowel distances before an anastomosis, resection or creating a stoma. However, this prudent attitude can cause some involuntary mismeasurements. We have demonstrated {{for the first time}} that the measured SBL is dramatically shortened after a repeated measurement, with this shortening reaching up to 14  %. We observed that there was obvious contractions of the <b>small</b> <b>bowels</b> after the first measurement and this resulted to a shorter measurements in the second.|$|R
40|$|Gastroschisis (gastroshisis) {{represents}} evisceration of {{the abdominal}} organs, most commonly <b>small</b> <b>bowels,</b> stomach and gonads {{through the front}} abdominal wall defect, almost always {{to the right of}} the umbilicus (90 %) from which it is separated by thin skin bridge. The incidence of this anomaly is 0. 5 to 4 per 10. 000 liveborn babies. We presented a patient, aged 27 years, who had gastroschisis of the fetus in the 13 th week of gestation diagnosed by ultrasound. Ultrasound examination is the method of choice for prenatal detection of fetal anomalies. By differential diagnosis, the possible existence of omphalocele should be eliminated using (2 D, 3 D) and power Doppler technology which significantly makes the assessment of gynecologist easier during establishment of the final diagnosis...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Vaginal cuff {{dehiscence}} (VCD) and evisceration (VCDE) {{are rare}} but rather serious complications of hysterectomy procedures. We aimed {{to report a}} case of VCDE happening eleven years after the initial surgery and review a treatment protocol of this rare complication. Case: A 68 years old Tunisian female patient In 2004, the patient underwent concomitant chemoradiation followed by total abdominal radical hysterectomy for a squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. Eleven years later, after an abdominal thrust due to a strong cough the patient had a protrusion of the two <b>small</b> <b>bowels.</b> Patient was surgically treated following a combined approach. The follow-up did not show any sign of relapse. Conclusion: VCDE is a rare complication of hysterectomy that carries a lot of mobimortality if not treated on time. Surgery without delay is usually a guarantee for a god outcome...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Mesenteric {{thrombosis}} {{related to}} trauma is an uncommon entity and has poor prognosis when have low flow and hemorrhagic shock. It usually presents with a challenging diagnosis and high mortality rates, despite appropriate treatment. CASE REPORT: Patient with blunt trauma was admitted and initial treatment, complementary exams showed ribs and humerus fractures. Computerized tomography showed aerial distension in <b>small</b> <b>bowels</b> along with gastric stasis and hidropneumothorax. The patient had hypotension during clinical observation and cardiopulmonary arrest, responding to reanimation. Taken to surgery for damage control, {{it was found}} extensive necrosis of right colon, which was excised and performed primary anastomosis. He was admitted {{in the intensive care}} unit, evolving with oliguria, miosis, convulsion, and pulseless electric activity, dying three days after hospital admission. CONCLUSION: Although uncommon, mesenteric ischemia with venous thrombosis might be secondary to systemic hypotension, frequently followed by fatal outcomes...|$|R
25|$|Small {{intestine}} {{bacterial overgrowth}} (SIBO), also termed bacterial overgrowths, or <b>small</b> <b>bowel</b> bacterial overgrowth syndrome (SBBOS), is a disorder of excessive bacterial {{growth in the}} small intestine. Unlike the colon (or large bowel), which is rich with bacteria, the <b>small</b> <b>bowel</b> usually has fewer than 10,000 organisms per millilitre. Patients with bacterial overgrowth typically develop symptoms including nausea, bloating, vomiting, diarrhea, malnutrition, weight loss and malabsorption, which {{is caused by a}} number of mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|Crohn's disease {{typically}} affects {{fairly well}} demarcated segments of bowel in the colon and often affects {{the end of}} the <b>small</b> <b>bowel.</b>|$|E
25|$|Enteroclysis {{has shown}} to be very {{accurate}} in diagnosing <b>small</b> <b>bowel</b> diseases, with a sensitivity of 93.1% and specificity of 96.9%. It permits detection of lesion {{which may not be}} seen with other imaging techniques. There is no significant difference in terms of detection of clinically significant findings, sensitivity or specificity between enteroclysis and CT enterography. Enteroclysis compares favorably with wireless capsule endoscopy and double-balloon endoscopy in the diagnosis of mucosal abnormalities of the <b>small</b> <b>bowel.</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{is a case}} of a 95 year {{lady who}} was brought to the {{accident}} and emergency department with vague right hip pain. She was deaf and mute and taking history from her was like “mission impossible”!. She was conformable in bed and initial examination was documented “unremarkable ” apart from right hip tenderness on movement. Her old notes indicated that she had intramedullary nail for femoral neck fracture in the past; Therefore, pelvic and right hip X-rays were requested to rule out any fracture. No fracture was found but, surprisingly, pelvic X-ray (figure 1) showed dilated small intestinal loops. On re-examination, her bowel sounds were exaggerated and she had a tender small swelling in the right groin. Her plain abdominal X-ray and CT scan (figure 2) confirmed the presence of <b>small</b> <b>bowels</b> obstruction [1, 2] due to an obstructed right femoral hernia...|$|R
30|$|The {{mean age}} was 35.4  ±  13.0 (median and range 33 and 19 – 67) and 18 were male (64.3  %).

40|$|A preterm male neonate was {{diagnosed}} as having microvillus inclusion disease based {{on the characteristics of}} histological and ultrastructural findings. The peripheral blood sample also revealed MYO 5 B mutation. He had been on long-term parenteral nutrition. However, a bowel segment was seen in the baby's diaper during hospitalization when he was 5 months old. Serial abdominal ultrasound demonstrated progressive dissection of the bowel wall with detached mucosa in real-time. Small intestinal epithelia were seen on the histology of the detached bowel segment. He died 2 weeks after the episode; postmortem autopsy showed diffuse detachment of mucosa of <b>small</b> <b>bowels</b> without perforation. This is the first report of an infant with microvillus inclusion disease that presented with bowel “dissection”.
