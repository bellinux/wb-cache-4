This paper {{analyses}} {{the relationship}} between financial <b>stress</b> <b>indicator</b> variables and monetary policy in South Africa with emphasis on how robust these variables {{are related to the}} monetary policy interest rate. The financial <b>stress</b> <b>indicator</b> variables comprise a set of variables from the main segments of the South African financial market that include the bond and equity securities markets, the commodity market and the exchange rate market. The empirical results show that the set of financial <b>stress</b> <b>indicator</b> variables from the bond and equity securities markets as well as those from credit markets and property markets are robustly associated with the monetary policy interest rate, while the set of financial <b>stress</b> <b>indicator</b> variables from commodity markets and the exchange rate market are weakly associated with the monetary policy interest rate.

Fieldwork generated a suite of primary stream health indicators. Geographic information system techniques generated spatially-explicit metrics of land cover and a lumped metric of nearby population that put stress on stream health. Stream health indicators were aggregated into a stream health index, and land-use <b>stress</b> <b>indicators</b> were aggregated into a land-use stress index, using data envelopment analysis (DEA). DEA was then applied to these indices to create an ecological performance index. Dominator analysis generated a set of practical role models for each ecologically underperforming site.

In this study, the presence of cribra orbitalia and enamel hypoplasia was observed in 294 adult individuals (111 women, 135 men and 48 undetermined individuals) from the Early Mediaeval (9 th - 10 th century) Slavic skeletal series at Mikulčice (Great Moravia), IIIrd church.

Smoltified salmon were acclimatized in 30 % saltwater and exposed to high levels of lice infestation. The number of copepods per fish ranged from 15 to 285, with a mean of 106. The infested salmon were sampled 6 times over the 29 -day experimental period and examined for alterations in primary and secondary <b>stress</b> <b>indicators,</b> including plasma concentrations of cortisol, glucose, electrolytes, thyroid hormones T 3 and T 4, and haematocrit level.

From this data, a mathematical model was designed and then assessed by testing its reliability when applied to HR variation versus different types of stress indicators (EMG, GSR, Work Load, questionnaires such as STAI-S, ALES).

Stress {{in a country}} {{is defined as the}} difference between the country’s actual short-term interest rate and the interest rate that would prevail if that country was able to follow an “optimal” monetary policy.
