50|$|Middle school cheerleading evolved {{shortly after}} high school <b>squads</b> were created. In middle school, cheerleading <b>squads</b> serve the same purpose, and follow the same rules as high school <b>squads.</b> <b>Squads</b> cheer for {{basketball}} teams, football teams, and other sports teams in their school. <b>Squads</b> also perform at pep rallies and compete against other local schools from the area.

These stunts range from preps, thigh stands, and extensions, to harder one-legged stunts.|$|R
