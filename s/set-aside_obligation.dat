40|$|The <b>set-aside</b> <b>obligation</b> {{under the}} Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) brought {{widespread}} benefits for wild farmland species. Shortly {{after it was}} abolished in 2008, the national political process in Finland {{replaced it with a}} targeted agri-environment scheme for environmental fallow. Though potentially highly valuable, the value of the current scheme for securing biodiversity is yet to be confirmed. This study evaluates the importance of set-asides established under CAP to all birds of open farmland based on national monitoring data from 2001 to 2006. The set-aside fields supported 25 - 40 % more species and held 60 - 105 % more pairs of birds typical of open farmland in comparison with cereal fields within a similar landscape setting. The estimated effect of set-aside presence in farmland on the studied bird species is large enough to trigger considerable changes in bird populations on the national scale. The relevance of the results to the novel agri-environment scheme is discussed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceChanges of {{agricultural}} land use often induce changes in hydrological behavior of watersheds. Hence, effective information regarding runoff responses to future land use scenarios provides useful support for decision-making in land use planning and management. The objective {{of this study is}} to develop a methodology to assess land use change scenario impacts on runoff at the watershed scale. This objective implies translating qualitative information from scenarios into quantitative input parameters for biophysical models. To do so, qualitative information from scenarios should be quantified and spatialized. The approach is based on the combination of 2015 local land use change scenarios (SYSPHAMM method) based on local stakeholders expertise, a model of spatio-temporal allocation of crops to fields (LandSFACTS model) and a watershed runoff model (STREAM model). The study was conducted for regions underlain by silty loamy soils scattered across Northern Europe. It was applied on the Saussay watershed in Upper Normandy (France). The approach is illustrated through runoff assessment of one of the land use change scenarios (characterized by the ending of the <b>set-aside</b> <b>obligation</b> and the disappearance of dairy farming). This scenario appeared relevant for local stakeholders. The methodology presented suggests that assessing local land use scenarios in terms of runoff requires taking into account crop allocation diversity allowed by farmers' decision rules. This requirement accounts for runoff variability at the watershed outlet since crops spatial distribution throughout the watershed, depending on farmers' specific decision rules (i. e. cropping systems), strongly condition runoff phenomenon. Besides, choices regarding scenario implementation (quantification and spatialization) should to be made according to those cropping systems. Accordingly, taking into account crop allocation diversity due to farmers' cropping systems shows that there is a variability in terms of runoff at the watershed outlet (from 19 478 m 3 to 35 004 m 3 for the winter period and a low-intensity rainfall event for example). This variability can then be explored with local decision makers with the aim of finding solutions reducing runoff risks. The proposed approach provides a useful source of information for assessing the responses of surface runoff of future land use changes. Such scenarios providing impact assessment on runoff should encourage both local policy makers and local actors to actively discuss the future of land use in Upper Normandy...|$|E
40|$|The {{proposals}} for reforming the Common Agricultural Policy within the Mid Term Review of the European Commission fueled {{the discussion about}} the future of direct payments to farmers. The EU Commission recommends a decoupling of animal and area payments from the production by granting these direct payments as a payment claim per hectare of eligible farm land. However, introducing area tied payments the intended shift of payments â€œfrom the produce to the producerâ€ will not take place, but instead an increased transfer of payments to land owners seems likely. This study therefore analyses the impacts of changing the area payments for grand cultures into person-tied payments on the cereals market of the European Union. For the assessment of impacts homogenous natural locations are clustered. The clustering is based on the regional reference yields for cereals and the share of arable land of total agricultural area in different farm types of the regions. For these production locations total production costs for cereals, oilseeds, and protein crops are calculated {{as a function of the}} farm size in order to estimate a cost reduction potential subject to structural changes within agriculture. The main results are the following: 1) Prerequisites are good for the EU to cultivate cereals since a major part of the production is located in highly competitive regions. Thus the EU would remain a net exporter of cereals even producing under world market conditions. However, maintaining the intervention price system while abolishing the <b>set-aside</b> <b>obligation</b> could lead to an uncontrolled increase of cereal stocks. 2) Even on highly competitive locations a significant structural change is required in order to reduce costs and to yield profits without area payments. Depending on the development of the world market prices for cereals the model calculations find a reduction of the work force between 20 000 and 50 000 labor units. 3) Without area payments the profits per hectare and thus the rents would decrease notably and therefore result in a corresponding income loss for land owners. An exclusive granting of payment claims to the producers would in particular affect former farmers, whose rental incomes contribute substantially to their pension plans.

40|$|Water and {{wildlife}} {{on a commercial}} farm: multifunctional management of set-aside and other natural resources in lowland England C. Stoate Natural resource management on farmland can often be multifunctional. At Loddington, the Allerton Project’s research and demonstration farm in Leicestershire, England, the set-aside area necessary to qualify for Arable Area Payments is used to achieve environmental benefits. These include planting of crops for wildlife, {{and the creation of}} a riparian buffer strip that protects watercourses from pollutants from arable land while also providing a wetland habitat. These habitats are exploited by wild gamebirds, as well as other wildlife. At Loddington, a management system integrating commercial farming, <b>set-aside</b> <b>obligations,</b> game management and other environmental objectives has also resulted in increases in numbers of nationally declining songbird species. This principle could be applied more widely in Europe. Objectives and implementation vary from field to farm and landscape/catchment scale, requiring varying levels of collaboration between farmers, according to farm size in different regions. However, this project demonstrates that a range of environmental objectives can be integrated into a farm business, satisfying current Rural Development objectives for multifunctional management and use of natural resources...|$|R
