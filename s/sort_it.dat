5|$|Despite its short life, {{the first}} Disraeli {{government}} succeeded in passing {{a number of}} pieces of legislation of a politically noncontentious <b>sort.</b> <b>It</b> ended public executions, and the Corrupt Practices Act did much to end electoral bribery. It authorised {{an early version of}} nationalisation, having the Post Office buy up the telegraph companies. Amendments to the school law, the Scottish legal system, and the railway laws were passed. Disraeli sent the successful expedition against Tewodros II of Ethiopia under Sir Robert Napier.|$|E
5|$|The {{circumstances}} in which the Crosby Garret helmet was buried are still unclear, but the discoveries made by the post-discovery Tullie House/PAS excavations have provided much more detail about its context. It was clearly deposited within an artificial feature that had been specially constructed; Stuart Noon of the Museum of Lancashire suggests that the feature may have been intended as a memorial of some <b>sort.</b> <b>It</b> was not buried in an isolated spot but within a long-occupied Romano-British farming settlement that had clearly adopted aspects of Roman culture. Given the settlement's proximity to Roman military locations, it is very possible that some of its inhabitants served with the Roman army, which often recruited mounted auxiliaries from among native peoples. The helmet may well already have been a valuable antique {{at the time of}} its burial; if the coins found nearby reflect when it was buried, it could have been over a century old by the time it was deposited. It was deliberately broken before being buried in what may have been intended as a ritual sacrifice. The identity of its owner will never be known, but it could have been that a local inhabitant who had formerly served with the Roman cavalry was responsible for the helmet's deposition.|$|E

25|$|Repington (whom Wilson {{thought a}} “dirty brute” and “lying brute”) {{attacked}} the current standards of British staff officers in The Times on 27 September 1910, arguing that Wilson had educated staff officers to be “sucking Napoleons” and that Robertson was a “first rate man” who would <b>sort</b> <b>it</b> out. Wilson wrote to Lord Loch (27 September 1910) “we can comfort ourselves with the reflexion {{that to be}} abused by Repington is the highest praise an honest man can get”.|$|E

This film does nothing of the <b>sort.</b> <b>It</b> draws out from the {{historical}} objectivity of the Gospel narratives sentiments of forgiveness, mercy, and reconciliation. It captures the subtleties and the horror of sin, as well as the gentle power of love and forgiveness, without making or insinuating blanket condemnations against one group. This film expressed the exact opposite, that learning from the example of Christ, there should never be any more violence against any other human being.|$|E

25|$|Heapsort is a {{much more}} {{efficient}} version of selection <b>sort.</b> <b>It</b> also works by determining the largest (or smallest) element of the list, placing that at the end (or beginning) of the list, then continuing {{with the rest of the}} list, but accomplishes this task efficiently by using a data structure called a heap, a special type of binary tree. Once the data list has been made into a heap, the root node is guaranteed to be the largest (or smallest) element. When it is removed and placed at the end of the list, the heap is rearranged so the largest element remaining moves to the root. Using the heap, finding the next largest element takes O(log n) time, instead of O(n) for a linear scan as in simple selection sort. This allows Heapsort to run in O(n log n) time, and this is also the worst case complexity.|$|E
25|$|The {{stand by}} diver will be {{prepared}} {{in the same}} way as the working diver, but will not enter the water until needed. He will usually be prepared to the stage of readiness to enter the water, and then will remove his mask, or have his helmet removed and will then sit in as comfortable a place as can be found, so that in case of an emergency he can be readied for action in as short a time as possible. This often means setting up some form of shelter from the weather, and heat and sunshine are usually more of a problem than cold and wet. It is frequently necessary to cool the standby diver to avoid overheating, and dehydration can also be a problem. When the working diver is using a helmet, the standby diver may use a full face mask or bandmask, as this makes it quicker to get into the water in an emergency. The stand by diver's job is to wait until something goes wrong, and then be sent in to <b>sort</b> <b>it</b> out. For this reason a stand by diver should be one of the best divers on the team regarding diving skills and strength, but does not have to be expert at the work skills for the specific job. When deployed, the standby diver will normally follow the umbilical of the diver who is in trouble, as unless it has been severed, it will reliably lead to the correct diver. The standby diver must maintain communications with the supervisor throughout the dive and is expected to give a running commentary of progress so that the supervisor and surface crew know as much as possible what is happening and can plan accordingly, and must take the necessary steps to resolve incidents, which may involve supply of emergency air or locating and rescuing an injured or unconscious diver. In bell diving, the bellman is the standby diver, and may have to recover a distressed diver to the bell and give first aid if necessary and possible.|$|E
500|$|The {{population}} of Cassel grew to about 4,200 {{people by the}} mid-19th century. Benjamin Disraeli, later to become Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, stayed there for a month in September–October 1845 and {{wrote in a letter}} to his sister Sarah that he considered it [...] "an extremely savage place; few of the inhabitants, & none of the humbler classes, talk French, there is no library, bookseller's shop, nor newspaper of any <b>sort</b> ... <b>It</b> is quite French Flanders, their provisions come from Holland, the Hotel de Ville was built by the Spaniards, the carillons are perpetually sounding, & religion is supreme." ...|$|E

500|$|Paiyaa (...) is a 2010 Indian Tamil-language romantic road action film written, {{produced}} {{and directed by}} N. Linguswamy. It stars Karthi and Tamannaah, with Milind Soman, Sonia Deepti and Jagan appearing in supporting roles. The film follows the journey of two strangers – a jobless carefree man, living in Bangalore, and a woman {{with whom he has}} fallen in love. Upon the woman's request, he drives her to Mumbai, while a group of gangsters follow them, planning to kidnap the woman. Meanwhile, the man also has a past in the city and he goes there to <b>sort</b> <b>it</b> out.|$|E
500|$|He {{returned}} to his pre-war clerical job at the Sydney Town Hall, but soon switched to a job with motor parts distributor Stack & Company, which allowed him more time for cricket commitments. Morris was automatically restored to the Sheffield Shield team in 1946–47 upon the resumption of competition. He made 27 and 98 in his first match against Queensland, and was selected for an Australian XI match against Wally Hammond's touring MCC team when first-choice opener Bill Brown was injured. In what was effectively a trial for the Test team, Morris scored 115 and featured in a 196-run partnership with Test captain Don Bradman, who scored 106. It was {{the beginnings of a}} productive cricketing relationship. Morris said of Bradman: [...] "He was marvellous. If you had a problem, you could go to him and <b>sort</b> <b>it</b> out. I found him relaxed and straightforward".|$|E
500|$|The cast was {{receptive}} to the finale storyline. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, actor John Noble noted he liked how the story ultimately ended with having the two Walters [...] "perhaps negotiate a truce and put their minds together" [...] through a [...] "very inventive intervention by Peter, who basically took control of destiny and forced his two fathers to look {{each other in the}} eye, as if telling them: <b>Sort</b> <b>it</b> out, gentlemen.'" [...] He later noted, [...] "We finish [...] in a very dramatic place." [...] Joshua Jackson praised the role-reversal of his character with Walter's, [...] "You had Peter wracked with guilt over the circumstances tied to the decision he made [...] and clinging to hope that there might be some way out. I can’t have made a cosmically bad decision! There must be some way to put this right! Which is fascinating, because that’s basically been Walter for as long as we’ve known him. So I loved how Peter ceases to be so stubborn when it comes to Walter, comes to understand him and even begins to see things the way he does." ...|$|E

However, this is more often an advantage for insertion <b>sort</b> in that <b>it</b> runs much more efficiently if the array is already sorted or [...] "close to sorted." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{dominant}} {{performance by}} the Mercedes cars sparked controversy in the paddock. Daniel Ricciardo issued apologies to the Australian fans after what he felt was a [...] "boring" [...] race. Red Bull quarreled with their engine manufacturer Renault and lamented the dominance of their rivals, calling for the FIA {{to step in and}} apply rule changes to level the field, fearing that the public would lose interest in the sport if nothing happened. Mercedes chief Toto Wolff reacted furiously, telling his rivals to [...] "get your fucking head down and work to <b>sort</b> <b>it</b> out", but later {{made it clear that he}} [...] "didn't mean the f-word in relation to him" [...] regarding the comments by Christian Horner. Nico Rosberg voiced hopes that their rivals would get closer over the course of the season, saying during the post-race press conference: [...] "I hope we can have a good fight. That would be awesome." [...] This statement caused amusement from Sebastian Vettel, who replied: [...] "Be honest. Do you really hope so? Seriously? You finished 30 seconds ahead of us and you hope it's going to be closer? So you hope you slow down? Is that what you're saying?" ...|$|E
500|$|Before the Clash began {{recording}} {{their second}} album, CBS requested that they adopt a cleaner sound {{than its predecessor}} {{in order to reach}} American audiences. Sandy Pearlman, known for his work with Blue Öyster Cult, was hired to produce the record. Simonon later recalled, [...] "ecording that album was just the most boring situation ever. It was just so nitpicking, such a contrast to the first album... it ruined any spontaneity." [...] Strummer agreed that [...] "it wasn't our easiest session." [...] Although some listeners complained about its relatively mainstream production style, Give 'Em Enough Rope received largely positive reviews upon its November release. It hit number 2 in the UK, but it was not the American breakthrough CBS had hoped for, reaching only number 128 on the Billboard chart. The album's first UK single, the hard rocking [...] "Tommy Gun", rose to number 19, the highest chart position for a Clash single to date. In support of the album, the band toured the UK supported by the Slits and the Innocents. The series of concerts—there were more than thirty, from Edinburgh to Portsmouth—was promoted as the <b>Sort</b> <b>It</b> Out Tour. The band subsequently undertook its first, largely successful tour of North America in February 1979.|$|E
500|$|Although his age {{made him}} ineligible {{to enter the}} 2005 AFL Draft, Selwood's accomplishments during the year led to AFL Talent Manager Kevin Sheehan rating him [...] "the best 17-year-old in Australia". Bendigo Pioneers {{regional}} manager Ray Byrne noted that [...] "ability-wise, Joel was streets ahead of everyone. Even at an early age, he was a standout". Byrne praised Selwood's professionalism, noting that he had [...] "never seen a kid prepare in the TAC Cup like Joel (Selwood). He had a fantastic football brain, he could <b>sort</b> <b>it</b> out within 10 minutes of a game who should be where and (doing) what". Selwood received an array of accolades and honours as a bottom-aged player, winning mid-year State honours for Victoria Country in the AFL National Championships. His performances in the championships earned him end-of-year All-Australian honours and the Most Valuable Player award for Victoria Country. In addition, he was named in the TAC Cup Team of the Year, awarded a scholarship within the prestigious AIS-AFL Academy, and subsequently captained his older teammates in the annual under-18s International Rules Series in Ireland. His performances in Ireland earned him the Ron Barassi Medal, as the adjudicated Most Valuable Player of the tour. Selwood's achievements in local football were recognised when he was listed as a finalist in the 2006 Bendigo Sports Star of the Year Award.|$|E
