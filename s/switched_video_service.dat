40|$|In {{this article}} the author adjusts data from studies {{conducted}} at Carnegie-Mellon University into the comparative costs of local exchange carrier (LEC) and cable television (CATV) provision of <b>switched</b> <b>video</b> <b>service</b> by applying more realistic {{assumptions about the}} treatment of LEC embedded copper plant. He finds that, contrary to the conclusion of those earlier studies, {{in the long run}} an integrated broadband and narrowband network supplied by an LEC would be cheaper than separate stand-alone LEC and CATV production processes for their respective services. However, these long-run savings could be jeopardized if inappropriate policy decisions are taken in the near future. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract–Third {{generation}} of mobile communication systems brought new packet <b>switched</b> realtime <b>video</b> <b>services.</b> To detect errors {{in a video}} packet, parity bits are used at different layers of the protocol stack. If an error occurs, the whole UDP packet is usually discarded. Still, it can happen that the major part of such a packet might have been correct and the detailed information about correctness of the packet segments is known at lower layers. In this article an error detection mechanism using information from lower layers at the decoder is proposed and its benefits and implementation costs are analyzed. Key words: RLC CRC, streaming video, error resilience...|$|R

40|$|Even if {{all legal}} entry {{barriers}} were eliminited, telephone companies would face dim prospects for competing with cable television operators in {{the transport of}} <b>video</b> <b>services,</b> at least during this decade. This situation arises because the economic characteristics of fibre-based integrated broadband networks of interest to telephone companies are not promising. Unless the demand for <b>switched</b> <b>video</b> is strong, households {{will continue to be}} served separately by cable television networks and by switched narrowband networks during the 1990 s. ...|$|R

50|$|<b>Switched</b> <b>video</b> or <b>switched</b> digital <b>video</b> (SDV), {{sometimes}} referred to as switched broadcast (SWB), is a telecommunications industry term for a network scheme for distributing digital video via a cable. <b>Switched</b> <b>video</b> sends the digital video in a more efficient manner so that additional uses may be made of the freed up bandwidth. The scheme applies to digital video distribution both on typical cable TV systems using QAM channels, or on IPTV systems. Users of analog video transmitted on the cable are unaffected. See diagram to the right for an illustration of how <b>switched</b> <b>video</b> saves bandwidth on a cable company's cables in the last mile where channels are transmitted via coaxial cable.|$|R
50|$|For a <b>switched</b> <b>video</b> {{system to}} work on cable systems, all digital {{television}} users in a subscription group must have devices capable of communicating to the distribution hub in a compatible manner. Unlike other features dependent on two-way communication such as video on demand, the requirement to upgrade all digital set-top boxes within a group makes conversion to <b>switched</b> <b>video</b> extremely expensive. CableLabs proposed in the CableCARD 2.0 specification that two-way communication be supported with a scheme which required more powerful hardware capable of running Java programs. Many cable companies have indicated they will build lower cost devices {{that do not require}} this OCAP programming environment, so that upgrading to a <b>switched</b> <b>video</b> system would not be as costly. Consumer electronics companies also prefer a more light weight solution for two-way communication, and so absent a standard for two-way communication, the conversion to <b>switched</b> <b>video</b> may require many years to complete.|$|R

(This applies to one-way devices only; two-way devices are capable of receiving and viewing <b>switched</b> <b>video.</b> The ability for one-way devices to receive and view <b>switched</b> <b>video</b> has changed with the addition of the Tuning Resolver Interface Specification. Tuning adaptors and tuning adaptor interfaces have been added to provide communication back to the headend needed for <b>switched</b> <b>video.)</b> CableCARDs are not necessary for viewing unscrambled digital cable channels if the user has a QAM tuner—a feature in some televisions and DVRs. CableCARD support is most common on higher end televisions that include a special slot for the CableCARD and a built-in cable tuner. The card acts like a unique [...] "key" [...] to unlock the channels and services to which the cable customer has subscribed, and the television's remote-control will also control the cable channels. Televisions that support CableCARD should be labeled by the manufacturer as [...] "digital cable ready" [...] (DCR).|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to seek input for a new online {{audiovisual}} heritage service. In doing so, we assess comparable online <b>video</b> <b>services</b> to gain insights into the motivations and perceptual innovation characteristics of the <b>video</b> <b>services.</b> The research is based on data from a Dutch survey held among 1, 939 online <b>video</b> <b>service</b> users. The results show that online <b>video</b> <b>service</b> held overlapping antecedents but does show differences in motivations and in perceived innovation characteristics. Hence, in general, one can state that in comparison, online <b>video</b> <b>services</b> comply with different needs and have differences in perceived innovation characteristics. This implies that one can design online <b>video</b> <b>services</b> for different needs. In addition to scientific implications, the outcomes also provide guidance for practitioners in implementing new online <b>video</b> <b>service...</b>|$|R

40|$|Present-day {{communication}} systems rely moreheavily on video compression than ever before. As broadband services increase in avail-ability, <b>video</b> <b>services</b> such as user-generated con-tent sites increase in popularity. Despite these recent advances, <b>video</b> <b>services</b> over the Internet still must choose between host-ing lower-quality videos that need less band-width or hosting higher-quality video downloads that aren’t available in real time. Two broad cat-egories classify {{the quality of}} <b>video</b> <b>services</b> and user experience: video over the Internet and broadcast <b>video</b> <b>services.</b> Broadcasters deliver <b>video</b> over the Internet through Internet Protocol (IP) networks, which isn’t the same as video over IP (IPTV) that telecom-munications companies deploy {{as an alternative to}} cable TV services. IPTV guarantees the quality of <b>service</b> while Internet <b>video</b> <b>services</b> do not. The nature of the <b>service</b> influences the <b>video</b> compression algorithms used. Online services require low complexity and low bit rate video codecs, while broadcast <b>video</b> <b>services</b> value qual-ity as the most important criterion. Online users widely employ VP 6, WMV, Real video, MPEG- 4, H. 264, and H. 263 as the most popular video codecs. However, the MPEG- 2 video compression standard dominates broadcast services today with applications that include digital TV, HDTV, and DVD.
