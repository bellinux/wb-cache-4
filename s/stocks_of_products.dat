40|$|The {{management}} of the <b>stocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> derived from the blood processing collected in blood banks {{is a problem for}} health services in Brazil and the world. Quantify the stocks of these products in order to equalize the demand and supply is not a simple task. It's necessary ensure that the product is available when needed and in due time. However, there is no how overestimate these stocks given that the product is perishable and it is not easy the availability of raw material (blood) for processing. There are few studies in Brazil, however, that discuss this issue. This study will focus on one Brazilian Hemocentro, which has faced the challenge of measure the demand for haemotherapic's products and establish parameters to control their stocks. Thus, it was sought to adapt a recent study realized out of the country, about sizing of stocks of a inventory for blood banks, combined with a forecast model of demand for blood derivatives subclassified by blood type. This control aims to increase the availability of the transfusion service, as it intends to reduce shortages and wastage of the blood collected...|$|E
40|$|<b>Stocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> in use are {{the pivotal}} engines that drive {{anthropogenic}} metal cycles: They support {{the lives of}} people by providing services to them; they are sources for future secondary resources (scrap); and demand for in-use stocks generates demand for metals. Despite their great importance and their impacts on other parts of the metal cycles and the environment, the study of in-use stocks has heretofore been widely neglected. Here we investigate anthropogenic and geogenic iron stocks in the United States (U. S.) by analyzing the iron cycle over the period 1900 – 2004. Our results show the following. (i) Over the last century, the U. S. iron stock in use increased to 3, 200 Tg (million metric tons), which is the same order of magnitude as the remaining U. S. iron stock in identified ores. On a global scale, anthropogenic iron stocks are less significant compared with natural ores, but their relative importance is increasing. (ii) With a perfect recycling system, the U. S. could substitute scrap utilization for domestic mining. (iii) The per-capita in-use iron stock reached saturation at 11 – 12 metric tons in ≈ 1980. This last finding, if applicable to other economies as well, could allow a significant improvement of long-term forecasting of steel demand and scrap availability in emerging market economies and therefore has major implications for resource sustainability, recycling technology, and industrial and governmental policy...|$|E

According to data on {{norms of}} {{consumption}} of vegetable production {{of scientific research}} institute of Food of the Russian Academy of Medical Science, potatoes win first place with norm of 120 kg {{a year on the}} person. In this regard much attention is paid to processing of potatoes that allows to prolong the term of its validity, and also to reduce the capacity of storages and to reduce transport transportations as 1 kg of a dry potatoes produсt is equivalent 7 - 8 kg of fresh potatoes. Thus industrial processing of potatoes on dry mashed potatoes allows to reduce losses of potatoes at storage and transportation, there is a possibility of enrichment of products vitamins and other useful components, its nutrition value remains better, conditions for complex processing of raw materials with full recycling and creations of <b>stocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> from potatoes on a crop failure case are created. Dry mashed potatoes are a product of long storage.

40|$|Anthropogenic metal cycles today confront three {{interconnected}} large challenges: {{an increasing}} global demand due to rising population and escalating industrialization and urbanization, a profound {{change of the}} global supply chain induced by globalization process, and growing pressures on climate change mitigation in a carbon constraint world. For example, the global demand for aluminum, the currently second most used metal worldwide, is anticipated to triple by 2050, by which time global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are advised to be cut by 50 %- 85 % to avoid catastrophic climate impacts. Process efficiency improvement and recycling can contribute to reducing emissions per material output; however, long-term material demand and scrap availability for recycling depend fundamentally on the dynamics of societies’ <b>stocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> in use. Meanwhile, on a country level, growing trade of aluminum products leads to cross-boundary leakages of both GHG emissions and secondary materials. This thesis aims to address these interconnected sustainability challenges using a systems approach that characterizes material flows both along their technological life cycle and across national boundaries, that enables an integrated analysis of the materialenergy- emissions nexus, and that considers both system feedbacks and time lags. We are essentially rolling out the anthropogenic aluminum cycles to understand their dynamics from a temporal perspective, to explore the trade links and interdependencies of individual country cycles from a geographical perspective, and to investigate the environmental consequences and mitigation strategies from a GHG emissions perspective. We endeavor to support industry and government in strategic decisionmaking related to aluminum production, trade, and climate change mitigation. Simulation {{results show that the}} contemporary global aluminum stock in use (0. 6 Gt or 90 kg/capita) has reached about 10 % of that in known bauxite reserves and represents an embodied energy amount that is equivalent to three quarters of the present global annual electricity consumption. The largest proportions of in-use stock are located in the U. S. (28 %), China (15 %), Japan (7 %), and Germany (6 %) and in sectors of building and construction (40 %) and transportation (27 %). Industrialized countries have shown similar patterns of aluminum in-use stock growth: once the per-capita stocks have grown to a threshold level of 50 kg, they kept a near linear annual growth of 5 - 10 kg/capita; no clear signs of saturation can be observed yet. The present aluminum stocks in use vary widely across countries: approximately 100 - 600 kg/capita in industrialized countries and below 100 kg/capita in developing countries. The growing global aluminum in-use stock has significant implications on future aluminum demand and provides important recycling opportunities that will be critical for GHG emissions mitigation in the aluminum industry in the coming decades. The trade-linked multilevel contemporary global aluminum cycle reveals several important features of the aluminum production, trade, and use patterns. (i) While the Southern hemisphere is the main primary resource supplier, aluminum production and consumption concentrate in the Northern hemisphere, where we thus also find the largest potential for recycling; (ii) The varying magnitudes of aluminum stocks and flows at the country level strongly reflect the availability of resources, the state of development, the structure of industry and economy, and the wealth and lifestyle of the country; (iii) The global aluminum cycle depends substantially on international trade of aluminum in all forms, but trade patterns vary significantly by commodity and country; (iv) The major industrialized countries tend to have a substantial and increasing presence throughout the stages from aluminum production on, while developing countries rarely create value added in later stages after bauxite refining; (v) A small group of countries {{play a key role in}} the global redistribution of aluminum and in the connectivity of the network. These results provide potential insights to inform government and industry policies in resource and supply chain security, value chain management, and cross-boundary environmental impacts mitigation. Strategies to decarbonize the anthropogenic aluminum cycle can be divided into process technology improvements (e. g., best available technology, new technologies such as inert anode and wetted cathode) and system-wide improvements (e. g., electricity decarbonization, improvement of post-consumer scrap recycling and processing and manufacturing yield). Taking the U. S. aluminum cycle for example, the reduction potentials that may be theoretically achieved for all process technology improvements add up to a 61 % reduction relative to the baseline in 2006, the majority of which lies within the smelting process. Low emission energy, which implies that all electricity and fuels for the aluminum cycle can be produced with near-zero emissions, shows the highest theoretical reduction potential (83 %) of all system-wide strategies. If we can recover the aluminum lost in landfills, scrap export, and obsolete product stock accumulation and export, significant reductions (in territorial emissions) can be achieved (81 %, 47 %, and 15 %, respectively). Maximizing yield of semi-manufacturing and manufacturing processes (i. e., yield loss completely eliminated) can each reduce emissions by about 10 %. However, combination of these strategies does not lead to additive reductions due to system interactions; challenges are likely to arise while approaching these theoretical potentials in practice. The global model results show that future aluminum in-use stock patterns set essential boundary conditions for future emission pathways and mitigation priorities. Higher stock saturation levels result in higher aluminum demand and higher emissions, and earlier saturation times lead to earlier emission peaks and higher cumulative emissions until 2050. If developing countries follow industrialized countries in their aluminum stock patterns, a 50 % emission reduction by 2050 below 2000 levels cannot be reached even under very optimistic recycling and technology assumptions. The target can only be reached if future global per-capita aluminum stocks saturate at a level much lower than that in current major industrialized countries (200 kg/capita). As long as global inuse stocks are growing rapidly, radical new technologies in primary production (e. g., inert anode and carbon capture and storage) have the greatest impact in emission reduction; however, their ‘window of opportunity’ is closing once the stocks begin to saturate and the largest reduction potential shifts to post-consumer scrap recycling.

40|$|In {{business}} cycle analysis {{the development of}} inventories still plays a crucial role. The strong movements over time have a large effect particularly on {{the growth rate of}} GDP. Quantitative data on inventories are generally of rather low quality. As a complement to quantitative statistics, business tendency surveys (BTS) offer actual data on <b>stocks</b> <b>of</b> different categories and on order books (often called negative inventories) to estimate actual values. However, the qualitative data do not show up in the empirical analysis. One reason could be that the aggregation process in BTS of these two items is often not adequate. Three alternative weighting methods were applied at firm level: no weighting, weighting with the number of employees, weighting with the number of employees plus the ratio of order books/stock to sales. These were compared with the current weighting method which includes stratification and branch weights by value added. The four indicators for each of the BTS questions had a statistically different variance, mean or distribution in most cases. The comparison of these four versions of weighting with the reference series – growth rate of order books and <b>of</b> <b>stocks</b> <b>of</b> finished <b>products</b> – produced quite different results. For the growth rate of order books, the best fit was with the non-weighted responses of the firms to the question on changes of order books.
