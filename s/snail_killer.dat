5000|$|Red cherry shrimp are {{primarily}} biofilm and algae eaters. They will eat any food intended for aquarium use, but some will prefer compressed algae discs (algae wafers). Blanched (boiled until soft) vegetables such as zucchini (courgette), baby carrots, peas and spinach {{can be used}} as a supplemental food, but should be fed sparingly. Uneaten vegetables can very quickly decompose and create water quality problems.To keep a clean substrate, some shrimp keepers put a glass bowl or glass plate on the bottom for the food. If feeding commercial fish/shrimp food ensure that there is no copper added (some breeders avoid only pure/elemental copper [...] ) as this is dangerous for shrimp. Many breeders think copper sulfates, found in most fish food, are tolerated in low amounts. Copper sulfates found in <b>snail</b> <b>killer</b> are in high amounts and will kill shrimp.|$|E
40|$|A {{follow-up}} to a population-based case-control study of pediatric brain tumors in Los Angeles County, California, involving mothers of 224 cases and 218 controls, investigated {{the risk of}} household pesticide use from pregnancy to diagnosis. Risk was significantly elevated for prenatal exposure to flea/tick pesticides -odds ratio (OR) = 1. 7; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 1 - 2. 6 -, particularly among subjects less than 5 years old at diagnosis (OR = 2. 5; CI, 1. 2 - 5. 5). Prenatal risk was highest for mothers who prepared, applied, or cleaned up flea/tick products themselves (OR = 2. 2; CI, 1. 1 - 4. 2; for subjects < 5 years of age, OR = 5. 4; CI, 1. 3 - 22. 3). A significant trend of increased risk with increased exposure was observed for number of pets treated (p = 0. 04). Multivariate analysis of types of flea/tick products indicated that sprays/foggers were the only products significantly related to risk (OR = 10. 8; CI, 1. 3 - 89. 1). Elevated risks were not observed for termite or lice treatments, pesticides for nuisance pests, or yard and garden insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, or <b>snail</b> <b>killer.</b> Certain precautions,if ignored, were associated with significant increased risk: evacuating the house after spraying or dusting for pests (OR = 1. 6; CI, 1. 0 - 2. 6), delaying the harvest of food after pesticide treatment (OR = 3. 6; CI, 1. 0 - 13. 7), and following instructions on pesticide labels (OR = 3. 7;CI, 1. 5 - 9. 6). These findings indicate that chemicals used in flea/tick products may increase risk of pediatric brain tumors and suggest that further research be done to pinpoint specific chemicals involved...|$|E
