40|$|The {{conventional}} {{command and}} control based spectrum management has led to substantial underutilization of some spectrum bands while severely crowding others due to the uneven and dynamic needs that vary over time and at different locations. <b>Spectrum</b> <b>trading</b> {{has emerged as a}} promising management approach to substantially improve spectrum utilization and user experience in wireless communications by taking advantage of market-based mechanisms. This article presents an overview of <b>spectrum</b> <b>trading,</b> including the fundamental characteristics of <b>spectrum</b> <b>trading</b> markets, the state-of-the-art techniques for modeling and resolving various <b>spectrum</b> <b>trading</b> issues, and trading based dynamic spectrum sharing and access.

30|$|By this way, {{we can use}} the {{spectrum}} resource to enhance the system performance. We consider spectrum sharing as a <b>spectrum</b> <b>trading</b> process; therefore, price not only acts an important role in <b>spectrum</b> <b>trading</b> but also is an effective way to improve system utilization and performance to maximize the primary users' profits. The <b>spectrum</b> <b>trading</b> process indicates the values of both spectrum pricing and purchasing by allowing the <b>spectrum</b> <b>trading</b> between secondary users (SUs) and primary users (PUs). The price paid by SU to PU depends on the satisfaction to use that spectrum, while the price determines the PU's revenue.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Spectrum trading {{creates more}} {{accessing}} opportu-nities for secondary users (SUs) and economically benefits the primary users (PUs). However, {{it is challenging to}} implement <b>spectrum</b> <b>trading</b> in multi-hop cognitive radio networks (CRNs) due to harsh cognitive radio (CR) requirements on SUs ’ devices and complex conflict and competition relationship among dif-ferent CR sessions. Unlike the per-user based <b>spectrum</b> <b>trading</b> designs in previous studies, in this paper, we propose a novel session based <b>spectrum</b> <b>trading</b> system, spectrum clouds, in multi-hop CRNs. In spectrum clouds, we {{introduce a new}} service provider, called secondary service provider (SSP), to harvest the available spectrum bands and facilitate the accessing of SUs without CR capability. The SSP also conducts <b>spectrum</b> <b>trading</b> among CR sessions w. r. t. their conflicts and competitions. Lever-aging a 3 -dimensional (3 -D) conflict graph, we mathematically describe the conflicts and competitions among the candidate sessions for <b>spectrum</b> <b>trading.</b> Given the rate requirements and bidding values of candidate trading sessions, we formulate the optimal <b>spectrum</b> <b>trading</b> into the SSP’s revenue maximization problem under multiple cross-layer constraints in multi-hop CRNs. In view of the NP-hardness of the problem, we have also developed heuristic algorithms to pursue feasible solutions. Through extensive simulations, we show that the solutions found by the proposed algorithms are close to the optimal one. I...|$|E

The dream of open market for new entrants and their coexistence with giant operators can be realized by the fancy concept of virtualization, which will be one of the key technologies in the future networks specially in the wireless part. Future virtualized mobile networks will comprise of a large number of (small) operators all competing for the spectrum resources. Such a scenario motivates and provisions the dynamic resource trading framework. This paper aims at presenting the realization concept of a dynamic <b>spectrum</b> <b>trade</b> market of future. We use the virtualized Long Term Evolution (LTE) as a realization framework for the proposed auctioned based dynamic spectrum sharing. We also investigate the profit function of spectrum broker and operators. We also study the realization of dynamic spectrum allocation on very small time instances (seconds) and investigate how the reservation price tunes the stake-holders’ profit and resource allocation efficiency.

Nonetheless, an important factor when envisioning a successful <b>spectrum</b> <b>trading</b> environment is to consider how comparable an available frequency is to the frequency an spectrum user prefers. With this aim, we consider the fungibility scores previously determined in [1] in order to explore further parameters that can influence this quantification of the level of fungibility.

40|$|<b>Spectrum</b> <b>trading</b> allows incumbents of {{spectrum}} {{to increase}} their profit margins by selling portions of unused spectrum to secondary systems. While being a spectrally efficient process; interference from secondary usage degrades {{the performance of the}} incumbent network. We propose distributed power control algorithms with incumbent protection for secondary systems which is incorporated in the incumbent's pricing mechanism. Pricing is a fundamental part of the <b>spectrum</b> <b>trading</b> economic model; it indicates the value of spectrum to both buyers (SSP) and sellers (PSP) and influences the forces of demand and supply. There exist a compromise between the accrued revenue from <b>spectrum</b> <b>trading</b> and the resultant QoS degradation caused by SSPs to PSPs. interference from SSPs may increase churn within the PSP network, therefore, pricing algorithms need to be efficiently designed to capture PSPs profit in relation to the magnitude of SSPs interference. We consider distributed power control algorithms (PCA) for the SSP network and allow secondary <b>spectrum</b> <b>trading</b> in TV white spaces (TVWS) and demonstrate that a PSP can profit from secondary <b>spectrum</b> <b>trading</b> without obtrusive interference from SSPs. The power control algorithm introduced therefore ensures that the incumbent's interference threshold is never violated, leading to increased profit and reduced churn for the incumbent operator and improved quality of service for the secondary system due to spectrum buy. © 2013 IEEE...|$|E

40|$|<b>Spectrum</b> <b>trading</b> is a {{promising}} method to improve spectrum usage efficiency. Several issues must be addressed, however, to enable <b>spectrum</b> <b>trading</b> {{that goes beyond}} conservative trading idle bands and achieve cooperation between primary and secondary users. In this paper, we argue that spectrum holes should be explicitly endogenous and negotiated by <b>spectrum</b> <b>trading</b> participants. To this end, we proposed an a Vickery auction based, coopetive framework to foster cooperation, while allowing competition for spectrum sharing. Incentive schemes and penalty for revocable spectrum are proposed to increase the spectrum access opportunities for SUs while protecting PUs spectrum value.

40|$|<b>Spectrum</b> <b>trading</b> {{markets are}} of growing {{interest}} to many spectrum management agencies. They {{are motivated by}} their desire to increase the use of market based mechanisms for spectrum management and reduce their emphasis on command and control methods. Despite the liberalization of regulations on <b>spectrum</b> <b>trading</b> in some countries, spectrum markets have not yet emerged as a key spectrum assignment component. The lack of liquidity in these markets is sometimes cited as a primary factor in this outcome. This work focuses on determining the conditions for viability of <b>spectrum</b> <b>trading</b> markets by considering scenarios with different market structures, number of trading participants and amount of tradable spectrum.

Here, the strategies of the primary users are coevolving. They are characterized by the spectrum prices and cooperation intensity levels. The primary users interact indirectly by means of the demand stimulation of the secondary users and an insurance pool, which is provided by the spectrum exchange management system. The existence of the insurance pool is motivated by the needs of avoidance of the financial losses. The simulation results indicate the reliability of the insurance mechanism. In addition, several notable phenomena have emerged from the interactions of agents. The price increase resulting from the spontaneously formed oligopolistic practices of agents is considered as the most emergent feature of the model.|$|R
