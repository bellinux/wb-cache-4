5000|$|The clutch is {{typically}} disengaged by a thrust bearing that makes contact with pressure petals on the <b>clutch</b> <b>ring</b> plate and pushes them inward {{to release the}} clutch pad friction. Normally the bearing remains retracted away from the petals and does not spin. However, the bearing can be [...] "burned out" [...] and damaged by using the clutch pedal as a foot rest, which causes the bearing to spin continuously from touching the clutch plates.|$|R

50|$|In a {{synchromesh}} gearbox, {{to correctly}} match {{the speed of}} the gear to that of the shaft as the gear is engaged the collar initially applies a force to a cone-shaped brass clutch attached to the gear, which brings the speeds to match prior to the collar locking into place. The collar is prevented from bridging the locking rings when the speeds are mismatched by synchro rings (also called blocker rings or baulk rings, the latter being spelled balk in the U.S.). The synchro ring rotates slightly due to the frictional torque from the cone clutch. In this position, the dog clutch is prevented from engaging. The brass <b>clutch</b> <b>ring</b> gradually causes parts to spin at the same speed. When they do spin the same speed, there is no more torque from the cone clutch and the dog clutch is allowed to fall into engagement. In a modern gearbox, the action of all of these components is so smooth and fast it is hardly noticed.|$|R

40|$|Tapered I-section {{members have}} been {{employed}} widely {{for the design of}} long-span structures such as large clear-span buildings, stadiums, and bridges because of their structural efficiency. For optimized member design providing maximum strength and stiffness at minimum cost, general non-prismatic (tapered and/or stepped cross-sections) as well as singly-symmetric cross-sections have been commonly employed. Fabricators equipped to produce web-tapered members can create a wide range of optimized members from a minimal stock of different plates and coil. Linearly tapered web plates can be nested to minimize scrap. In many cases, the savings in material and manufacturing efficiencies lead to significant cost savings relative to the use of comparable rolled shapes. To employ Design Guide 25 (DG 25) which provides guidance for the application of the provisions of the AISC Specification to the design of frames composed of general non-prismatic members, designers need a robust and general capability for determining the elastic buckling loads. Furthermore, robust tools are needed to facilitate the selection of optimum non-prismatic member designs based on minimum cost. 	This research addresses the calculation of the elastic buckling loads for general non-prismatic members subjected to general loadings and bracing conditions (typically involving multiple brace points along a given member). This research develops an elastic buckling analysis tool (SABRE 2) {{that can be used to}} define general geometries, loadings and bracing conditions and obtain a rigorous calculation of the elastic buckling load levels. The three-dimensional finite element equations using open section thin-walled beam theory are derived and formulated using a co-rotational approach including load height effects of transverse loads, <b>stepped</b> <b>flange</b> dimensions, and bracing and support height effects. In addition, this research addresses an algorithmic means to obtain automatic optimized member and frame designs using the above types of members based on Genetic Algorithms (GA). These capabilities are implemented in the tool SABRE 2 D, which provides a graphical user interface for optimized member and frame design based on updated DG 25 provisions and the elastic buckling load calculations from SABRE 2.

50|$|On {{a routine}} trip to Yokohama, the Soroe Maersk had to cease {{operations}} {{on the outskirts of}} East China Sea because the 4th engineer was seriously scalded when he was cleaning a drain pipe. This incident took place on 4 November 2008, and resulted in the 4th engineer getting life flighted off the ship by the Japanese Coast Guard. The engineer was doing his normal rounds when he noticed that the dirty water drain was clogged and not working properly. The next day, he made the 2nd engineer aware of the problem at which point they both decided to clean the pipe. After a couple basic <b>steps,</b> the <b>flange</b> that they loosened stopped bleeding. After the flange was completely taken apart the 4th engineer proceeded to clean the pipe for ten seconds, at which point hot steam and oil shot out the pipe covering the engineer. As a result, the 4th engineer was scalded by the hot oil and steam.|$|R
40|$|The basic {{physics of}} the seam sealing process in vehicle {{construction}} has been worked out. Thereyby, modeling by computer simulation has played an important role. The rheological behavior of the highly viscous PVC and PUR sealing fluids, e. g., shear thinning, influence of temperature, yield stress, and thixotropy has been studied. Important conclusions {{with regard to the}} development of meaningful methods for material testing can be deduced. Another area of investigation was concerned with the heating behavior of the flow in hoses, tubes and in the nozzle. From the VOF simulations important information on the application on substrate <b>steps</b> and hem <b>flanges</b> can be obtained. The model that has been developed will be used for the development and design of improved equipment and materials as well as for a better matching of equipment and materials. This will have a direct impact on the ecological and economical aspects of the seam sealing process...|$|R
50|$|Synchromesh {{transmission}} {{was introduced}} by Cadillac in 1928. If the dog teeth {{make contact with the}} gear, but the two parts are spinning at different speeds, the teeth will fail to engage and a loud grinding sound will be heard as they clatter together. For this reason, a modern dog clutch in an automobile has a synchronizer mechanism or synchromesh, which consists of a cone <b>clutch</b> and blocking <b>ring.</b> Before the teeth can engage, the cone clutch engages first, which brings the selector and gear to the same speed using friction. Until synchronization occurs, the teeth are prevented from making contact, because further motion of the selector is prevented by a blocker (or baulk) ring. When synchronization occurs, friction on the blocker ring is relieved and it twists slightly, bringing into alignment certain grooves or notches that allow further passage of the selector which brings the teeth together. The exact design of the synchronizer varies among manufacturers.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Wear loss {{is defined}} as volume, weight and length {{difference}} due to the wear process. In practice, measurement of wear loss is difficult because {{most parts of the}} machine have no simple shape and are not easy or even impossible to measure the changes of volume, weight or length. In this paper, a particular method of wear loss measurement based on computer image collection and analysis was developed to measure the length changes of some particular parts such as ball grooves of the muster <b>clutch’s</b> release <b>ring</b> of a type of tracked vehicle. Macro-surface profiles of a worn surface of a groove on a release ring were taken by a digital camera first and were demarcated. Then worn scars of these digital photos were scaled in length by a computer image processing software of DT vision foundry. The geometrical relationship between wear length and depth was analyzed so that the wear depth was available as well. Results show that the length of the scar is 15. 9 mm and the depth is 1. 48 mm. Then the surface of the wear scar was measured by a type of 3 D laser scanning machine and the points cloud was rearranged and edited by a reverse software of Surfacer. Results of 3 D scanning show that the length of the scar is 15. 7 mm and the depth is 1. 56 mm, which is well consistent with the results of the method mentioned above. It demonstrates the effectiveness and economy of using the method of computer image collection and analysis for wear loss measurement. ...|$|R
40|$|Rotary forging is an {{attractive}} incremental metal forming with many advantages over any other processes, requiring smaller deformation force and providing high accuracy (near-net-process). The main applications of rotary forging process include families of bevel and helical gears, and flanged components for transmissions such as disk, rollers, wheels, etc. The main aim of this work is to study the impact of rotary forging process on the microstructural and texture evolution of high-strength materials, and martensitic stainless steels in particular, during cold rotary forging process. Jethete M 152 alloy is a cold formable 13 %-Cr martensitic stainless steel used in the aerospace industry. Jethete M 152 flanged test-pieces were rotary forged at room temperature. The process was interrupted at 4 intermediate <b>steps,</b> providing <b>flange</b> reductions of 25, 30, 50, 65 and 70 %. A complex grain flow and inhomogeneous deformation patterns are developed during rotary forging, characterized mainly by {{the formation of a}} strong deformation band which run parallel to the bottom die. A transition from asymmetrical bulging (inverted mushroom) to symmetrical bulging was observed {{as a result of the}} initial lower contact area of the preform with the bottom die. From microstructural analysis by EBSD, the lath structure of Jethete M 152 is gradually reoriented and changes it shape in a direction parallel to the compression plane, developing a lamellar/pancake structure in those positions with maximum deformation. These microstructural changes are accompanied with the development of a strong texture formed by a duplex + fibers aligned with the compression axis, being the fiber the stronger one. These findings are in good agreement with uniaxial compression for bcc metals. The analysis of the Orientation Distribution Figures (ODF) reveals that 4 main texture components are formed in the course of the rotary forging process: Brass { 110 }〈 112 〉, L { 110 }〈 110 〉, I { 112 }〈 110 〉, and Cube { 001 }〈 100 〉. In contrast with reported literature for bcc metals, no texture component associated to the γ-fiber ({ 111 } ‖ ND) was found...|$|R
