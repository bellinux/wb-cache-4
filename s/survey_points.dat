2500|$|At {{the same}} time, {{significant}} differences, unique issues, and deceptive myths are typically present. Lehman, regarding his 1997 <b>survey,</b> <b>points</b> to added discrimination and fears that {{gay and lesbian}} individuals may face. This includes potential dismissal by police and some social services, a lack of support from peers, fear of attracting negative stigma toward the gay community, the impact of HIV/AIDS status in keeping partners together (due to health care insurance/access, or guilt), threat of outing, and encountering supportive services that are targeted, or structured {{for the needs of}} heterosexual women, and may not meet the needs of gay men or lesbians. This service structure can make LGBTQ victims feel even more isolated and misunderstood than they may already because of their minority status. Lehman, however, stated that [...] "due to the limited number of returned responses and non-random sampling methodology the findings of this work are not generalizable beyond the sample" [...] of 32 initial respondents and final 10 who completed the more in-depth survey. Particularly, sexual stressors and HIV/AIDS status have emerged as significant differences in same-sex partner violence.|$|E

50|$|The {{improvement}} of GPS positioning doesn't require simultaneous measurements {{of two or}} more receivers in any case, but can also be done by special use of a single device.

5000|$|In surveying, free {{stationing}} (also {{known as}} resection) {{is a method}} of determining a location of one unknown point in relation to known points. There is a zero point of reference called a Total station. The instrument can be freely positioned so that all <b>survey</b> <b>points</b> are at a suitable sight from the instrument. Setting up the Total station on a known point, often {{it is not possible}} to see all <b>survey</b> <b>points.</b> With the Total Station, bearings and distances are measured to at least two known points of a control network. This with a handheld computer [...] recorded data is related to local polar coordinates, defined by the Horizontal Circle of the total station. By a geometric transformation, these polar coordinates are transformed to the coordinate system of the control network. Errors are distributed by least squares adjustment.

Results indicate that the maximum flow angle variation was + or - 3 degrees except when vortex generators were installed in the subsonic diffuser. The amplitude of these flow angle fluctuations was directly related to the amplitude of the total pressure fluctuations at the probe <b>survey</b> <b>point.</b> Flow angle fluctuations as high as + or - 11 degrees were recorded when vortex generators were installed near the probe <b>survey</b> <b>point...</b>|$|R

50|$|In 2009, Queensland celebrated Q150, its 150th anniversary as an {{independent}} colony and state.

5000|$|Survey markers, {{also called}} survey marks, survey monuments, or {{geodetic}} marks, are objects placed to mark key <b>survey</b> <b>points</b> on the Earth's surface.

Informally, such marks {{are referred to as}} benchmarks, although strictly speaking the term [...] "benchmark" [...] is reserved for marks that indicate elevation.

50|$|The {{directing}} point (DP) was a {{term used}} in the U.S. Coast Artillery to identify a precisely <b>surveyed</b> <b>point</b> that {{was used as the}} point of reference for preparing the firing data used to aim the guns of a given Coast Artillery battery.|$|R
50|$|<b>Survey</b> <b>points</b> {{are usually}} {{marked on the}} earth's surface by objects ranging from small nails driven into the ground to large beacons {{that can be seen}} from long distances. The {{surveyors}} can set up their instruments on this position and measure to nearby objects. Sometimes a tall, distinctive feature such as a steeple or radio aerial has its position calculated as a reference point that angles can be measured against.|$|E
50|$|Reduced Level in {{surveying}} {{refers to}} equating elevations of <b>survey</b> <b>points</b> {{with reference to}} a common assumed datum. It is a vertical distance between survey point and adopted datum plane. Thus it is considered as the base elevation which is used as reference to reckon heights or depths of other important places. Reduced here means equating and Level means Elevations. Datum may be real or imaginary location with a nominated elevation of straight zero.|$|E
50|$|The tunnel was mined by {{hand through}} shale, coal and sandstone, then lined with six courses of bricks (using over 23 million bricks in all) {{to form the}} {{horseshoe}} shape. It was aligned by drilling fourteen vertical shafts to provide <b>survey</b> <b>points</b> on the hillside above: after the tunnel was completed two shafts were closed and the remaining twelve were used as blast relief shafts to vent steam from the locomotives that passed through.|$|E
50|$|Few survey {{positions}} {{are derived from}} first principles. Instead, most <b>surveys</b> <b>points</b> are measured relative to previous measured points.
