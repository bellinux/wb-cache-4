5|$|Churchill's {{return to}} the prime ministership meant Lord Cherwell's {{return to the}} post of Paymaster General. He was a strong {{supporter}} of the atomic energy programme, but while he agreed with its size and scope, he was critical of its organisation, which he blamed for slower progress than its Soviet counterpart. In particular, the programme had experienced problems with Civil <b>Service</b> <b>pay</b> and conditions, which were below those for comparable workers in industry. The Treasury had agreed to some flexibility in exceptional cases, but the procedure for doing so was absurdly slow. Hinton in particular was concerned at the low remuneration his senior staff were receiving compared with those with similar responsibilities at ICI. When he attempted to bring Frank Kearton in as his successor, the Treasury refused to adjust the salaries of his other two deputies to match. Rather than ruin his organisation's morale, Hinton had dropped the proposal to appoint Kearton. Nor could any reorganisation be carried out without Treasury approval. Within a month of assuming office, Cherwell had prepared a memorandum proposing that responsibility for the program be transferred from the Ministry of Supply to an Atomic Energy Commission.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, {{while serving}} as torpedo officer on the depot ship , Scott learned of the {{financial}} calamity that had overtaken his family. John Scott, having sold the brewery and invested the proceeds unwisely, had lost all his capital and was now virtually bankrupt. At the age of 63, and in poor health, {{he was forced to}} take a job as a brewery manager and move his family to Shepton Mallet, Somerset. Three years later, while Robert was serving with the Channel squadron flagship , John Scott died of heart disease, creating a fresh family crisis. Hannah Scott and her two unmarried daughters now relied entirely on the <b>service</b> <b>pay</b> of Scott and the salary of younger brother Archie, who had left the army for a higher-paid post in the colonial service. Archie's own death in the autumn of 1898, after contracting typhoid fever, meant that the whole financial responsibility for the family rested on Scott.|$|E

Objections to paying for an excessive number of troops were raised, and some of the sums charged from 1942 onwards were never paid; however, the income tax rose from 10d to 5/- in Guernsey and from 1/6 to 5/- in Jersey. Surtax and purchase taxes was introduced and civil <b>service</b> <b>pay</b> reduced, but even so, the islands ended the war with a debt of £9,000,000, roughly the total value of every house in the islands.|$|E
500|$|When the Alamo Cenotaph {{was created}} by Pompeo Coppini in 1939, the 187 defender names on the {{monument}} came from the research of Amelia Williams, considered the leading Alamo authority of her day. [...] Her work is still used {{by some as a}} benchmark, although skepticism has been voiced. Lindley's 2003 Alamo Traces: New Evidence and New Conclusions is the result of his 15-year study of the battle, and upended much of what was previously accepted as fact. He devoted a chapter to deconstructing Williams' research as [...] "misrepresentation, alteration, and fabrication of data", criticizing her sole reliance on the military land grants without checking through the muster lists to identify the combatants. In lieu of <b>service</b> <b>pay,</b> the cash-poor Republic of Texas adopted the system of military land grants. Issuance was dependent upon the military muster lists and either the veterans or their heirs filing a claim, a process that required an upfront fee to complete. Lacking a completed claim, proof of service would appear only on a muster list.|$|E

50|$|It is the Government's {{established}} {{policy to}} offer sufficient remuneration to attract, retain and motivate staff of a suitable calibre {{to provide the}} public with an effective, efficient and high quality service. In {{order to ensure that}} civil <b>service</b> <b>pay</b> is regarded as fair and reasonable by both civil servants who provide the service and the public who foot the bill, the Government adopts the principle that the level of civil <b>service</b> <b>pay</b> should be broadly comparable with private sector pay. In 2003, the CSB embarked on an exercise to develop an improved civil <b>service</b> <b>pay</b> adjustment mechanism for long-term adoption in the civil service. The exercise has stemmed from the recommendations arising from the Review of Civil <b>Service</b> <b>Pay</b> Policy and System. Under the improved civil <b>service</b> <b>pay</b> adjustment mechanism, the conduct of periodic pay level surveys will be the principal means to ascertain whether civil <b>service</b> <b>pay</b> is broadly comparable to private sector pay and thus, in compliance with the established civil <b>service</b> <b>pay</b> policy. The CSB issued a consultation paper in November 2004, setting out the methodology of the pay level survey as recommended by a consultant and the proposals on the application of the survey results to the civil service. The field work of the pay level survey was to be carried out on the basis of April 2005 private sector pay, but implementation was delayed a year. In April 2007, the results were announced: 20 years after the previous such Pay Level Survey, none of the jobs in the public sector was found to be paid more than 5% above or below its private sector equivalent.|$|E
