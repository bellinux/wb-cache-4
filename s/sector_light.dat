5|$|At {{the dawn}} of the Industrial Revolution, {{development}} of the mining and metallurgical industries transformed the country from an agricultural society into an industrial nation; the South Wales Coalfield's exploitation caused a rapid expansion of Wales' population. Two-thirds of the population live in south Wales, mainly in and around Cardiff (the capital), Swansea and Newport, and in the nearby valleys. Now that the country's traditional extractive and heavy industries have gone or are in decline, Wales' economy depends on the public <b>sector,</b> <b>light</b> and service industries and tourism. Wales' 2010 gross value added (GVA) was £45.5 billion (£15,145 per head, 74.0% of the average for the UK, and the lowest GVA per head in Britain).|$|E

2500|$|The northernmost {{settlement}} is the seaside resort of Norddorf with a decoy pond and a <b>sector</b> <b>light.</b> Amrum's largest village, Nebel, is {{located near the}} eastern coastline. Notable sights there include the church of St. Clement with its [...] "talking gravestones", the Öömrang Hüs - a museum of local history, a wind mill and the Cemetery of the Homeless. Süddorf, today a district of Nebel, is the island's oldest hamlet. The Amrum Lighthouse is located there. Steenodde, also a neighbourhood of Nebel, had long been Amrum's only port until Wittdün, founded 1890, had taken over as the island's major ferry terminal. Of the three municipalities, Wittdün is most clearly influenced by tourism.|$|E

40|$|The {{proposal}} {{of a new}} display of depth contours and <b>sector</b> <b>lights</b> symbols on paper navigational charts published by the Hydrographic Institute of the Republic of Croatia (HHI) in Split is presented in this paper. Since the symbols on the HHI paper charts are defined in the publication entitled “Symbols and Abbreviations Used on Charts”, which is produced by each Member State for its charts by {{the recommendations of the}} International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), the proposed displays are in accordance with the specified publication. By studying all versions of the mentioned publication, the historical development of depth contours and <b>sector</b> <b>lights</b> display is presented. By comparing clips from the official paper chars scale of 1 : 100 000 with a classic display of these symbols and clips from the created samples of paper charts with the proposed display of these symbols, the impact on the readability of other symbols is analyzed and improvements of depth contours and <b>sector</b> <b>lights</b> display are shown...|$|R

50|$|Another {{example is}} the PEL <b>sector</b> <b>light</b> at Diego Garcia. The PEL <b>sector</b> <b>light</b> was {{constructed}} to guide US Navy vessels into the Diego Garcia port through a narrow entrance in the lagoon. The PEL <b>sector</b> <b>light</b> produces 3.5 million candela and is visible for 10 nautical miles (18.5 km) by day. The beam with 3 colors is narrow at 1.6°. This was required because the PEL <b>sector</b> <b>light</b> was built over 7NM (13 km) from the atoll entrance {{and it had to}} illuminate a safe entrance which is only 228 meters wide.|$|E

50|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{was further}} modernised in 1914: a new revolving optic was installed (which remained in use for 99 years), {{and a new}} additional light was installed along with fixed lenses at a level below the lantern, so the <b>sector</b> <b>lights</b> now shone from windows on the tower. The lighthouse was electrified in 1959, and in 1964 it became the first lighthouse to be monitored by telemetry from Harwich, ushering {{in a process of}} lighthouse automation which continued around England over the next 35 years. The keepers were withdrawn from Orfordness the following year.|$|R

5000|$|The MS-DOS {{version of}} PowerSlave {{features}} many differences from the console versions. The MS-DOS version {{was built on}} the Build engine, licensed from 3D Realms. The version used is a slightly earlier version of the engine, made sometime before the version used in Duke Nukem 3D.

50|$|The {{commercial}} sector consists of retail stores, offices (business and government), restaurants, {{schools and other}} workplaces. Energy in this sector has the same basic end uses as the residential sector, in slightly different proportions. Space conditioning is again the single biggest consumption area, but it represents only about 30% of the energy use of commercial buildings. Lighting, at 25%, plays a much larger role than {{it does in the}} residential <b>sector.</b> <b>Lighting</b> is also generally the most wasteful component of commercial use. A number of case studies indicate that more efficient lighting and elimination of over-illumination can reduce lighting energy by approximately fifty percent in many commercial buildings.|$|R
50|$|The 1895 {{lighthouse}} is a round brick tower, 128 ft high, painted {{black and}} white. It {{was designed by}} Thomas Matthews. Its main light had a range of , and in addition there were separate <b>sector</b> <b>lights,</b> two of which marked particular shoals or sandbanks, while another indicated the main channel along the Humber. Due to improvements in navigation, the light was discontinued in 1985. Since then, the lighthouse has remained empty. In 2013, however, Yorkshire Wildlife Trust was awarded a £470,500 grant to restore the lighthouse {{with a view to}} its being reopened as a visitor centre.

50|$|According to the {{national}} state owned energy center Motiva banning of incandescent lightbulbs will save 5.8% of households electricity (1.1 TWh) in Finland. The lightbulbs banning is not restricted in households but concern also other <b>sectors</b> <b>lighting,</b> like industry, service, agriculture and public lighting, making the total national percentage lower and total energy savings higher than the above given numbers 5.8% of electricity 1.1 TWh. Motiva calculation may have used average year consumption instead of the specific year e.g. 2006. According to the statistics of Finland, in 2006 the electricity used in households was 10.6 TWh excluding the electricity warming that was 9.1 TWh. Thus 1.1/19.7 would be ca 5.6% in 2006. Excluding electric warming it would be 10.4% of household electricity.|$|R

50|$|The PEL <b>sector</b> <b>light</b> is a {{projector}} style marine beacon {{which is}} used to guide maritime vessels. It does this by projecting a colored sector out to sea with very sharp color changes as the mariner transitions from one sector to the next. Typical PEL sector lights will have a complete color change over 1 meter (sideways movement) when the mariner is 5 km from the beacon. The PEL's application becomes relevant to the mariner when combined with a local marine chart as each application of a PEL varies greatly. They are used for guiding vessels into harbor, traffic separation or to illuminate hazards. The main advantage to a PEL <b>sector</b> <b>light</b> is that it has very sharp transitions between colors (typical 0.05°) and is bright enough to be used in daylight with up to 10 Nautical Miles or 18.5 km visibility.|$|E

40|$|A {{search is}} {{presented}} for decays beyond {{the standard model}} of the 125 GeV Higgs bosons {{to a pair of}} light bosons, based on models with extended scalar <b>sectors.</b> <b>Light</b> boson masses between 5 and 62. 5 GeV are probed in final states containing four tau leptons, two muons and two b quarks, or two muons and two tau leptons. The results are from data in proton-proton collisions corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19. 7 inverse femtobarns, accumulated by the CMS experiment at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. No evidence for such exotic decays is found in the data. Upper limits are set on the product of the cross section and branching fraction for several signal processes. The results are also compared to predictions of two-Higgs-doublet models, including those with an additional scalar singlet. Comment: Replaced with the published version.
