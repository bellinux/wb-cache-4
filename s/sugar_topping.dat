5000|$|Chouquettes, {{named for}} the {{diminutive}} of [...] "choux," [...] are small, round, hollow choux pastry covered with large-grain sugar. Craquelins are covered in a [...] "crackly" [...] <b>sugar</b> <b>topping</b> - and often filled with pastry cream, much like eclairs.|$|E
40|$|The {{harvest and}} {{transport}} of sugar beet leaves during harvesting {{can be considered}} a current task in the area of sugar beet growing system development. A rotary sugar beet leaf cutting mechanism is used for achieving the significant increase in the harvester forward speed during harvest. This leads to intensive vibrations of the topping mechanism in the longitudinal vertical plane causing the decrease of harvest quality. Therefore, it is necessary to analytically determine the effect of kinematic and design parameters of the <b>sugar</b> beet <b>topping</b> mechanism front-mounted on the tractor and to discover the value of the amplitude of oscillations in the longitudinal vertical plane of its <b>sugar</b> beet <b>topping</b> mechanism. We have constructed a mathematical model of the estimated motion of this machine by means of dynamics equations in Lagrange II-kind form. A system consisting of two non-linear differential equations was obtained by developing the equivalent scheme of selected generalized coordinates and by performing the necessary mathematical transformations. This system describes the vibrations of the <b>sugar</b> beet <b>topping</b> mechanism in the longitudinal vertical plane. The optimal design and kinematic parameters of the sugar beet topper mechanism front-mounted on the tractor were determined by means of our own software and numerical solution of the differential equation system, which allows the reduction of mentioned vibrations...|$|R

50|$|The cooked slices may {{be covered}} with <b>sugar</b> or sweet <b>toppings</b> such as jam, honey, fruit, or maple syrup, or served as a savory dish with ketchup or another sauce.|$|R
50|$|Another classic egg custard dish, crème brûlée {{tends to}} be {{prepared}} and served in a ramekin without any pastry or fruit topping and is given a fully caramelised top (by grilling a <b>sugar</b> <b>topping</b> until it is a hard, solid glaze).|$|E
5000|$|The Hertzog Koekie {{inspired}} {{supporters of}} Hertzog's political rival and contemporary Jan Smuts to bake {{a version of}} their own called [...] "Jan Smuts cookies". This confection also became popular in the 1920s and 1930s. Jan Smuts cookies have a creamed butter and <b>sugar</b> <b>topping</b> instead of the paler meringue topping of the Hertzog Koekie.|$|E
5000|$|In Mexico buñuelos {{are made}} from a yeasted dough {{with a hint of}} anise that is deep-fried, then drenched in a syrup of brown sugar, cinnamon, and guava. Buñuelos are {{commonly}} served in Mexico and other Latin American countries with powdered sugar, a cinnamon and <b>sugar</b> <b>topping,</b> or hot sugar cane syrup (piloncillo) and are sold in fairs, carnivals, and Christmas events such as Las Posadas.|$|E
50|$|The Indonesian pancake serabi is {{made from}} rice flour and coconut milk. The dish is often served with kinca, a thick, brown-colored coconut <b>sugar</b> syrup. Other <b>toppings</b> may include <b>sugar,</b> ground peanuts, sliced bananas, jackfruit, and other fruits, and chocolate. Other {{variations}} include cheddar cheese, corned beef, shredded chicken, and sausage.|$|R
50|$|A Dutch baby pancake, {{sometimes}} called a German pancake, a Bismarck, or a Dutch puff, is a sweet popover that is normally served for breakfast. It {{is derived from}} the German Pfannkuchen. It is made with eggs, flour, sugar and milk, and usually seasoned with vanilla and cinnamon, although occasionally fruit or another flavoring is also added. It is baked in a cast iron or metal pan and falls soon after being removed from the oven. It is generally served with fresh squeezed lemon, butter, and powdered <b>sugar,</b> fruit <b>toppings</b> or syrup. A basic batter incorporates 1/3 cup flour and 1/3 cup liquid per egg.|$|R
50|$|A {{cookbook}} {{from the}} 1890s called for lemon peel to be grated into the cake's batter. The batter was firm {{enough to be}} stretched with a rolling pin and cut into rounds with a dough cutter. This version used a sprinkling of almond meal and <b>sugar</b> as a <b>topping</b> for the cake prior to cooking, and did not call for rum.|$|R
5000|$|Sour {{cream is}} used {{primarily}} in the cuisines of Europe and North America, often as a condiment. It is a traditional topping for baked potatoes, added cold along with chopped fresh chives. It is used as the base for some creamy salad dressings and {{can also be used}} in baking, added to the mix for cakes, cookies, American-style biscuits, doughnuts and scones. It can be eaten as a dessert, with fruits or berries and <b>sugar</b> <b>topping.</b> Also, it is sometimes used on top of waffles in addition to strawberry jam [...] In Central America, crema (a variation of sour cream) is a staple ingredient of a full breakfast.|$|E
50|$|Fillings for pasticciotti {{include the}} {{traditional}} lemon-flavored custard or ricotta, and variant fillings such as almond, chocolate, pistachio or vanilla custard; fruit preserves; or gianduja or Nutella chocolate-hazelnut spreads. An unusual variation filled with ground veal and almonds but topped with sugar, pasticciotti di carne, {{is a local}} favorite in the Sicilian town of Patti. Pasticciotti di carne {{are similar to the}} Moroccan pastilla which also combines a meat filling with a <b>sugar</b> <b>topping.</b> In Italy, ricotta-filled pasticciotti are the typical variety in Sicily, while the custard filling is more commonly seen in the Apulia region of southeastern mainland Italy, particularly in the province of Lecce, where the city of Lecce named the pasticciotto its typical cake. In Naples, in southwestern Italy between Apulia and Sicily, custard fillings are common but the pasticiotto napoletano also includes cherries. Both custard and ricotta fillings {{can be found in the}} United States.|$|E
5000|$|Massialot {{describes}} {{himself in his}} preface as [...] "a cook who dares to qualify himself royal, {{and it is not}} without cause, for the meals which he describes...have all been served at court or in the houses of princes, and of people of the first rank." [...] Places where Massialot served banquets included the Château de Sceaux, the Château de Meudon, and Versailles. An innovation in Massialot's book was the alphabetisation of recipes, [...] "a step toward the first culinary dictionary" [...] Barbara Wheaton observes; Wheaton has compared the changes made in the various editions of Massialot: a glass of white wine in a fish stock makes a surprisingly late appearance, in 1703. Meringues make their first appearance under their familiar name in Massialot, who is also credited with Crème brûlée, in which the <b>sugar</b> <b>topping</b> was melted and burnt with a red-hot fire shovel.|$|E
50|$|This pie is also {{traditionally}} {{baked in}} large batches at the Appleby Horse Fair. At the fair {{large numbers of}} men would traditionally bring the pie <b>toppings</b> (<b>sugar,</b> mutton, parsley, haribo) and present them to women they were planning to court. Available women would generally wear a piece of their preferred topping (e.g. a sprig of parsley) in their hair.|$|R
40|$|Micro{{particles}} {{are small}} (< 1 µm), nonbiological particles {{that are used}} in many areas of daily life. As food additive they are used as anticaking agents or food colorants. The most common food-derived ingested compounds are aluminium silicate and titanium dioxide (TiO(2)), the latter being a white pigment used in toothpaste or <b>sugar</b> <b>toppings.</b> The increasing abundance of microparticles in the Western diet raises the question of the potential risks associated with gastrointestinal diseases such as Crohn's disease (CD). Accumulation of particles has been shown in cells of Peyer's patches, {{but it is not clear}} whether this also has pathological effects. NLRP 3 is a member of the intracellular pattern recognition receptor family and it is part of the inflammasome, a multiprotein complex containing caspase- 1 which activates the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL) - 1 β and IL- 18. With regard to recent findings identifying small particles such as asbestos and monosodium urate as NLRP 3 activators, TiO(2) may be another potential target for inflammasome studies. We found that macrophage-like cells readily take up TiO(2) after 6 h. Incubation of cells with TiO(2) resulted in the assembly of NLRP 3 with caspase- 1. This inflammasome assembly correlated with secretion of IL- 1 β. In intestinal epithelial cells, TiO(2) also was found to be ingested. The counting of particles localized intracellularly revealed a dose-dependent increase of TiO(2) -positive cells. This points to the fact that in humans with a leaky intestinal barrier (such as IBD patients), TiO(2) microparticles may be taken up by macrophages and intestinal epithelial cells, may activate the inflammasome and induce IL- 1 β and IL- 18 secretion. This may aggravate inflammation in susceptible individuals...|$|R

5000|$|A {{cousin of}} the {{croissant}} is the Italian cornetto (in the Center and South) or brioche (in the North). These variants are often {{considered to be the}} same, but that is not completely true: the French version tends to be crispy and contains a lot of butter, whereas an Italian cornetto or brioche is usually softer. Furthermore, the cornetto vuoto (Italian: [...] "empty cornetto") is commonly accompanied by variants with filling, which include crema pasticciera (custard), apricot jam or chocolate cream. They often come covered with powdered <b>sugar</b> or other <b>toppings.</b> Cornetto with cappuccino at the bar is considered to be the most common breakfast in Italy.|$|R
5000|$|The French, Austrians and Central Europeans produce elderflower syrup, {{commonly}} {{made from}} an extract of elderflower blossoms, which {{is added to}} Palatschinken filling instead of blueberries. People throughout much of Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe use a similar method to make a syrup which is diluted with water and used as a drink or as a flavoring in several food products. In Germany, yoghurt desserts are made with both the berries and the flowers. Fruit pies and relishes are produced with berries. In Italy (especially in Piedmont), Germany and Austria, the umbels of the elderberry are batter coated, fried and then served as a dessert or a sweet lunch with a <b>sugar</b> and cinnamon <b>topping,</b> known as [...] "Hollerküchel".|$|R
5000|$|Pulla ( [...] ; Swedish bulle or kanelbulle) is a mildly-sweet Finnish sweet roll or dessert bread {{flavored with}} crushed {{cardamom}} seeds and occasionally raisins or sliced almonds. Braid loaves (pitko) are formed from {{three or more}} braided strands of dough. The braids may also be formed into a ring. These braided strands or rings are typically coated with melted butter and then sprinkled with white sugar or almonds. Other types of pulla include small round ones that resemble English scones but have a <b>sugar</b> and butter <b>topping,</b> and larger cinnamon rolls called korvapuusti. The outside typically has a shiny brown glaze, formed by a coating of egg white, milk or a mixture of sugar and brewed coffee.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{research}} {{problem of the}} paper concerned verification whether applicable or known methods of post-harvesting evaluation of the roots of sugar beet may {{be applied to the}} assessment of the quality of work of technically varied new machinery for sugar beet har-vesting. Tests of machines of varied solutions of working units, in particular a topping unit, were carried out in order to accomplish the objective of the paper. Two self-propelled combine harvesters of Ropa euro-Tiger V 8 - 3 type and Kleine Beetliner Large and two sets for 2 -stage harvesting by M. A. C. E (Spain) and Amity (USA) companies were used in the study. Ropa euro-Tiger and Kleine Beetliner Large combine harvesters and M. A. C. E. set were equipped with a beet topper but of a varied topping system, whereas, only a defoliator was used in the set by Amity company. Field research of machines included assessment of the topping quality, losses caused by the broken tip of roots and damages of the lateral surface of roots. Research assumptions were assumed according to the method of the International In-stitute for Beet Research (I. I. R. B.). Moreover, assessment of the topping quality with the method of the Netherlands Institute of Sugar Beet Research (IRS) and the Institute of Agri-cultural Engineering of the Bonn University was carried out. Assessment of roots after defo-liation was carried out based on the Roller's classification (2010). Based on the research re-sults and analyses which were carried out, it was proved that the methods of measurement of the quality of beet harvesting machines operation are not fully useful for assessment of the introduced technical and technological changes. It mainly concerns the assessment of the roots topping. Thus, two modified methods of assessment of the quality of roots topping were suggested. They may be used both for machines equipped with a topping device and a defo-liator. Key words: harvesting <b>sugar</b> beet, <b>topping,</b> defoliation, quality of root...|$|R
