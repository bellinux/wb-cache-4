500|$|In May 1928, the KCA {{launched}} a Kikuyu-language magazine, Muĩgwithania (roughly translated as [...] "The Reconciler" [...] or [...] "The Unifier"), {{in which it}} published news, articles, and homilies. Its purpose was to help unify the Kikuyu and {{to raise funds for}} the KCA. Kenyatta, now described as Secretary of the KCA, was listed as the publication's editor, although Murray-Brown suggested that he was not the guiding hand behind it and that his duties were largely confined to translating things into Kikuyu. Kenyatta's approach to campaigning was cautious; he was aware that Thuku had been exiled for his activism. In Muĩgwithania, he expressed support for the churches, district commissioners, and chiefs. He also praised the British Empire, stating that: [...] "The first thing [...] is that all people are governed justly, big or small – equally. The <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that nobody is regarded as a slave, everyone is free to do what he or she likes without being hindered." ...|$|E
2500|$|For Tilghman, Princeton has two {{essential}} missions. [...] "One is {{to ensure}} that our doors are open as wide as possible to every talented student in the world who is capable of doing the hard work we ask of them. [...] And that means maintaining our commitment to financial aid, which is the tool – the critical tool – to get those students to Princeton. [...] And the <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that we must address the most critical issues, and push back the frontiers of knowledge, and not just in science and technology, but in social policy, and in public policy, and in understanding the nature of the human condition." ...|$|E
6000|$|Second. The <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> how to apply, {{or to make}} {{application}} of this Christ to the soul. And for this there are to be considered the following particulars-- ...|$|E
60|$|One <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> clear--the wheel must {{be removed}} from the block. A <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> equally clear--while the wheel was being removed the car would have to be {{fastened}} to the cable by the rope he had brought.|$|R
50|$|The {{elders and}} {{religious}} people advised the ruler that, two thing happened here, {{one is that}} the kings daughter was touched by a Muslim the <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> a boy gave pudava to his daughter (by giving boys mundu to the girl), meaning that the daughter cannot enter the palace anymore and also she got married by the Muslim boy.|$|R
5000|$|... "Lynne from Floydian_Hemptress asks: Would {{you agree}} that the instrumental, Let's Get Metaphysical, on your About Face cd, was a precurser to the later alleged phenomenon, known as Pink Floyd's Publius Enigma? sicDavid Gilmour: No {{it had nothing to}} do with it, there was no connection. The <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> some silly record company thing that they thought up to puzzle people with." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The {{first thing}} I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she wandered {{about in the}} wood, 'is to grow to my right size again; and the <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> to find my way into that lovely garden. I {{think that will be}} the best plan.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Messires," [...] said Sir Tristram, [...] "I {{have only}} to demand two things of you. One {{of them is that}} you give me your word that you will go to Cornwall and confess to King Mark that you have been overthrown by a Cornish knight; and the <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that you tell me if you saw Sir Bleoberis de Ganys pass this way?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The <b>SECOND</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> an [...] "Ohio Company" [...] has got {{together}} in Virginia; Governor there encouraging; Britannic Majesty giving Charter (March, 1749), {{and what is}} still easier, [...] "500,000 Acres of Land" [...] in those Ohio regions, since you are minded to colonize there in a fixed manner. Britannic Majesty thinks the Country [...] "between the Monongahela and the Kanahawy" [...] (southern feeders of Ohio) will do best; but is not particular. Ohio Company, we shall find, chose at last, as the eligible spot, the topmost fork or very Head of the Ohio,--where Monongahela River from south and Alleghany River from north unite to form [...] "The Ohio;" [...] where stands, in our day, the big sooty Town of Pittsburg and its industries. Ohio Company was laudably eager on this matter; Land-Surveyor in it (nay, at length, [...] "Colonel of a Regiment of 150 men raised by the Ohio Company") was Mr. George Washington, whose Family had much promoted the Enterprise; and who was indeed a steady-going, considerate, close-mouthed Young Gentleman; who came to great distinction in the end.|$|E
60|$|Our <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> then <b>is</b> to inquire, {{with what}} righteousness a man must be righteous, {{before he can}} do that which in a gospel-sense is called righteousness.|$|R
6000|$|<b>SECOND.</b> A <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> to <b>be</b> {{spoken to}} is this: {{to show what}} it is to be under the law as it is a Covenant of Works; to which I shall speak, and that thus-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... [Second.] But I pass this, {{and come}} to the <b>second</b> <b>thing,</b> which <b>is,</b> the cause of their being in a sad condition, which is by reason of their being in their {{particular}} persons under it.|$|R
6000|$|... "But suppose, ma'am," [...] {{continued}} Joe, {{without waiting}} for a reply; [...] "suppose that the house is alight. Well, the first thing you've got to do, is not {{to get into a}} fluster. That can't do no good, you know, and is sure to do mischief. Keep cool. That's the first thing, ma'am; and be deliberate in all ye do. The <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> to wrap a blanket round ye, an' {{get out of the house}} as fast as ye can without stoppin' to dress. It's of no use lookin' put out, ma'am; for it's better to escape without yer clo'es than to be burnt alive in 'em. Then be careful to shut all doors after ye as ye go. This keeps the air from gittin' at the fire, and so smothers it down till the ingines come up. Also keep all windows shut. If the smoke is like to choke ye, git yer nose as near the ground as possible, an' go along on yer hands and knees. A bit o' flannel or a worsted sock held over yer mouth an' nose, will help you to bear it better.|$|E
5000|$|... "In politics, it's {{what you}} {{perceive}} to be true that's true, not truth. If I {{tell you one thing}} is true, you will believe the <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> true. A good politician will tell you a few things that are true before he will tell you a few things that are untrue, because you will then believe all the things he has said, true and untrue." [...] (2011 speech in Prague) ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> our team. We {{are going}} to invest {{millions}} in this space. And we are assembling what I think is a dream team to go after core gamers on mobile, and we haven't even announced half the folks that are working on our first project. In the coming months we {{hope to be able}} to talk about more of the people who are working on it. And I think that's one of the most fundamental things about it, is the talent.|$|E
6000|$|... [Second.] The <b>Second</b> <b>thing</b> to <b>be</b> {{learned from}} these words, {{as they have}} a {{relation}} to them going before, is encouragement to those that are yet in the storm; and that from three great arguments.|$|R
6000|$|Second. But to the <b>second</b> <b>thing,</b> which <b>is</b> this, How far may such an one go? To {{what may}} such an one attain? Whither may he arrive, and yet be an undone man, under this covenant? [1] answer-- ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with The Guardian Byatt says: [...] "I started {{with the idea that}} writing children's books isn't good for the writers' own children. There are some dreadful stories. Christopher Robin at least lived. Kenneth Grahame's son put himself across a railway line and waited for the train. Then there's JM Barrie. One of the boys that Barrie adopted almost certainly drowned himself. This struck me as something that needed investigating. And the <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was,</b> I was interested in the structure of E Nesbit's family — how they all seemed to be Fabians and fairy-story writers." [...] The book has so many fictional and historical characters that Byatt had to create a spreadsheet in Excel to keep track of them all.|$|R
50|$|We {{are born}} into a social world, into families, and only later become individuals. The system of the founders institutionalizes this in three steps. First it recognizes that all right-thinking people of {{goodwill}} do not hold the same moral vision. The <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> to differentiate “between and individual and a person.”(p63) “Personhood entails the right--the vocation--to be different. Third, it calls for a secular or civic faith. Thus the US Constitution: “a practical, rather than creedal, vision of the good society.”(p66) It does less than command the socialist virtues; it does more than license =mere interest group horse-trading.|$|E
5000|$|... "Another {{thing is}} that I never liked {{fighting}} in the cage. I always liked {{to fight in the}} ring. The <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that I liked fighting in Japan. Japan is like my second home—I feel like I'm home in Japan. All those reasons brought me here, and I'm very happy that I'm going to fight here in Japan. But of course, one day, I don't know when, but definitely I'll be back in the UFC to show that it was just a bad period for me. Now I'm fully recovered, physically and mentally, most important mentally." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2008, {{the group}} {{received}} the MTV Legend award by MTV Russia. The {{group is the}} most successful Russian musical export of all time. Katina stated to Billboard Magazine; [...] "People will remember us for great songs, being free, taking life as it is and not being afraid of anything, [...] provocative images of two girls kissing each other, but the <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> the really great music." [...] In 2006, both Lena and Yulia were awarded [...] "Woman of the Year" [...] by GQ's Person of the Year Awards, but were not awarded under the band name.|$|R
60|$|Another {{fine day}} was striding in triumphant. The first <b>thing</b> Siegmund did <b>was</b> to salute the morning, {{because of its}} brightness. The <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> to call to mind the aspect of that bay in the Isle of Wight. 'What would it just be like now?' said he to himself. He had to give his heart some {{justification}} for the peculiar pain left in it from his sleep activity, so he began poignantly to long for the place which had been his during the last mornings. He pictured the garden with roses and nasturtiums; he remembered the sunny way down the shore, and all the expanse of sea hung softly between the tall white cliffs.|$|R
5000|$|In August 2013, Leslie {{released}} his fourth studio album, Black Mozart, through his #Renegades music club. In subsequent months, musicians such as 50 Cent, Raphael Saadiq, and Talib Kweli {{would use the}} underlying technology to launch their respective upcoming studio albums and power their own music membership clubs. Kweli spoke about the experience in an interview, “The first thing that appeals {{to me is the}} direct contact with the fans and the fact that I receive their e-mails...The <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> the fact that the money comes directly to me when you buy the album from me. It goes directly to my account. There is nobody taking their cut.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Webber won the {{previous}} race in Germany from pole position, to claim his first win at the 130th attempt. Despite an early drive-through penalty assessed for a dangerous manoeuvre {{to keep the}} Brawn GP car of Barrichello behind him at the start, the Australian driver had enough time in hand to rejoin out front and win by nearly ten seconds from Red Bull Racing team-mate Vettel. [...] "I don't really care what all the people say, I just do my work. I do what I know, to be honest. I am here because Red Bull just asked me to, as I do Formula 3 or World Series or GP2, I don't care. I just drive the cars. That's my job and that's what I enjoy doing in life. I'm here because Red Bull just sent me a message telling me that I have to drive this car so I'm here. I don't care what other people say, that's the main thing, first of all. And the <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that I know what my expectation is, I know what my target is. I know that today I didn't make any mistakes and I hope tomorrow I don't {{and even in the}} race and that's how I work at the end. My target here is to drive the car and not make mistakes. Then we will talk about times and about speed. But I don't feel I am a danger, not really." [...] Jaime Alguersuari, who was unfazed by the criticism directed at him for being too inexperienced for Formula One. Felipe Massa was third, to earn his first podium of the 2009 season to date. Championship leader Button could only muster a fifth-place finish, after being overhauled by the one-stopping Williams of Nico Rosberg, who finished fourth having started fifteenth.|$|E

60|$|Second, But to {{pass this}} {{and come to the}} <b>second</b> <b>thing,</b> which <b>is,</b> to show you how the Lord Jesus manages this his office of an Advocate before his Father against the adversary; for he pleadeth with the Father, but pleadeth against the devil; he pleadeth with the Father law and justice, but against the adversary he letteth out himself.|$|R

Researching part is focused on disassembly of the conveyor's options: it's driving force, pre-installed sensors. The first thing in the practical patr is about designe and describition of the hardware, which is used for automation of the conveyor.

First, open directly the RTSP streams transmitted from the IP camera using the library FFmpeg as opening a video file. The <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> to extract the background images from video signal using Gaussian mixture model. Then the foreground images are obtained through subtracting operation between the input image and the background image.

It doesn’t happen quickly. It’s not her fault, it’s just the way the system is. The <b>second</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> there’s really no way {{to get in touch with}} your nephrologist there or any of the nephrologists that you have seen, except through the nurse coordinator. If you say to have them give me a call, then they don’t ever give me a call, they give a message to my coordinator and then she calls and tells me what they said.
