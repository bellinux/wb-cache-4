The SB squad allegedly responsible for the crime had nine members, and acted on the direct instructions of the commander of an UPA regiment based in a nearby forest. All of the executions had been perpetrated under orders.

[...] While targets of SB violence were certainly not exclusively women and girls, {{a close look at}} patterns of rebel violence against local citizens suggests that reprisals against [...] "collaborators" [...] was a euphemism for violence against ethnic Poles during World War II and the first two postwar years, when three quarters of the violence against [...] "locals" [...] was directed against ethnic Poles.|$|E

According to the writing of one slain Ukrainian rebel, [...] "the Bolsheviks tried to take us from within...you can never know exactly in whose hands you will find yourself. From such a network of spies, the work of whole teams is often penetrated...". In November 1948, the work of Soviet agents led to two important victories against the UPA: the defeat and deaths of {{the heads of the}} most active UPA network in Western Ukraine, and the removal of [...] "Myron", the head of the UPA's counter-intelligence <b>SB</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|E

The substitution of one Tl by Sb, which occurs when the countercation is changed from potassium in K 6 Tl 2 Sb 3 to sodium, yielding only Na 6 TlSb 4, is driven by a distinctly tighter packing, a corresponding increase in the Madelung energy, and binding of the excess pair of electrons in the new conduction band...|$|R

40|$|Introduction We {{propose a}} {{conservative}} extension of Oz that adds futures and by-need synchronization. Futures are read-only views of logic variables {{that make it}} possible to statically limit the scope in which a variable can be constrained. For instance, one can express with futures safe streams that cannot be assigned by their readers. By-need synchronization makes it possible to synchronize a thread on the event that a thread blocks on a future. It is used to express dynamic linking and lazy functions. We also introduce variable assignment and distinguish between simple and complex variables. The idea is that programs should distinguish between the use of logic variables for concurrency and the use of logic variables for constraint programming. Variable assignment is an asymmetric operation that eliminates a simple variable by binding it to a given <b>unit.</b> <b>SB's</b> version of Mozart will provide for the distribution of ports, futures, and simple variables.

40|$|A pair of {{magnetic}} atoms with canted spins Sa, Sb can {{give rise to}} an electric dipole moment P. Several forms for the behavior of such a moment {{have appeared in the}} theoretical literature, some of which have been invoked to explain experimental results found in various multiferroic materials. The forms specifically are P 1 ~ R x (Sa x Sb); P 2 ~ Sa x Sb, and P 3 ~ Sa (R. Sa) - Sb (R. Sb), where R is the relative position of the atoms and Sa, <b>Sb</b> are <b>unit</b> vectors. To unify and generalize these various forms we consider P as the most general quadratic function of the spin components that vanishes whenever Sa and Sb are collinear, i. e. we consider the most general expressions that require spin canting. The study reveals new forms. We generalize to the vector P, Moriya's symmetry considerations regarding the (scalar) Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya energy D. Sa x Sb (which led to restrictions on D). This provides a rigorous symmetry argument which shows that P 1 is allowed no matter how high the symmetry of the atoms plus environment, and gives restrictions for all other contributions. The analysis leads to the suggestion of terms omitted in the existing microscopic models, suggests a new mechanism behind the ferroelectricity found in the 'proper screw structure' of CuXO 2, X=Fe, Cr, and predicts an unusual antiferroelectric ordering in the antiferromagnetically and ferroelectrically ordered phase of RbFe(MoO 4) 2. Comment: 11 pages, 2 figures. The present work is a considerable generalization of the earlier version. It corrects the statement in the abstract as to the generality of the expression for Delta.

40|$|The three-regime {{threshold}} autoregressive (TAR) {{model with}} a unit root process in the middle regime and the structural breaks (SB) model with level shifts are important and popular models for studying economic theories such as purchasing power parity (PPP) and economic variables with regime shifts. These nonlinear models have a significant influence on unit root tests. It {{is possible that the}} persistence of a variable becomes higher {{and the power of the}} unit root tests develops distortions if the form of the regime shifts is misspecified. This paper investigates the ability of unit root tests to detect stationarity in misspecified SB and three-regime TAR models. We show that the misspecified SB model has high persistence, similar to an autoregressive (AR) model, when the true process is a three-regime TAR process. On the other hand, unlike the AR model, the misspecified three-regime TAR model does not have persistence, when the true process is one with SB. The results of the Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that a unit root test performed in the misspecified three-regime TAR model has more power even under processes with <b>SB,</b> whereas a <b>unit</b> root test undertaken in the misspecified SB model does not perform well under three-regime TAR processes. We also provide some instances of applications in economic variables that would have regime shifts. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{contains}} two main parts: {{the first part}} focusses on an electron diffraction study on unsupported antimony (Sb) clusters, while {{in the second part}} the design and development of a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOFMS) is discussed. Electron diffraction is an ideal tool to study the structure of clusters entrained in a beam. The main advantage of this technique is the ability to study the clusters in situ and in an interaction-free environment. It is therefore not necessary to remove the particles from the vacuum system which would lead to oxidation. Since the particles {{do not have to be}} deposited on a sample for further investigation, there is also no substrate which could influence the cluster structure. An additional advantage is the short exposure to the electron beam, thereby minimising the likelihood of damaging the particles. Sb clusters were produced using an inert-gas aggregation source. To control the cluster properties the source temperature, pressure and type of cooling gas can be adjusted. In the range of source parameters tested, Sb clusters with three different structures were observed: a crystalline structure corresponding to the rhombohedral structure of bulk Sb, an amorphous structure equivalent to the structure of amorphous Sb thin films, and a structure with the same diffraction signature as Sb 4 (Sb evaporates mainly as Sb 4). This last structure was found to belong to large particles consisting of randomly oriented <b>Sb</b> 4 <b>units.</b> In order to study the size distributions and morphologies of the Sb clusters, the clusters were deposited onto substrates and studied under an electron microscope. The crystalline particles showed a wide variety of strongly faceted shapes. Depending on source conditions, the average cluster diameters ranged from 15 to 130 nm. There was a considerable disagreement between these values and the size estimates from the diffraction results with the latter being smaller by an order of magnitude. This might be due to the existence of domains inside the clusters. The amorphous particles were all found to be spherical with mean sizes between 27 and 45 nm. The Sb 4 particles showed a liquid-like morphology and tended to coalesce easily. Their sizes ranged from 18 to 35 nm. To obtain an independent method for determining the cluster size, a TOFMS was designed and developed in collaboration with Dr Bernhard Kaiser. However, the TOFMS failed to detect a cluster signal in the original set-up which is most likely due to a defective ioniser and underestimated cluster energies. Further tests were performed in a new vacuum system and mass spectra for palladium clusters were successfully recorded...|$|R
40|$|Multiple-collector {{inductively coupled plasma}} mass {{spectrometry}} (MC-ICP-MS) {{has been used for}} the precise measurement of Sb isotopic composition in geological samples, as well as Sb(III) and Sb(V) species in aqueous samples. Sb is chemically purified prior to analysis by using cation-exchange resin and cotton impregnated with thioglycollic acid (TCF). Purification through cation-exchange resin is required for the removal of matrix interfering elements such as transitional metals, whereas TCF is required for the separation of other hydride-forming elements such as Ge and As. The analyte is introduced in the plasma torch using a continuous flow hydride generation system. Instrumental mass fractionation is corrected with a "standard-sample bracketing" approach. Using this technique, the minimum Sb required per analysis is as low as 10 ng for an estimated external precision calculated for the 123 Sb/ 121 Sb isotope ratio of 0. 4 var epsilon <b>units</b> (2 sigma). <b>Sb</b> isotope fractionation experiments reported here indicate strong fractionation (9 var epsilon units) during Sb(V) reduction to Sb(III). Seawater, mantle-derived rocks, various environmental samples, deep-sea sediments and hydrothermal sulfides from deep-sea vents have been analyzed for their Sb isotope composition. We define a continental and oceanic crust reservoir at 2 ± 1 var epsilon units. Seawater var epsilon 123 Sb values do not vary significantly with depth and yield a restricted range of 3. 7 ± 0. 4 var epsilon <b>units.</b> <b>Sb</b> deposited in hydrothermal environments has a significant range of Sb isotopic composition (up to 18 var epsilon units). These variations may reflect not only contributions from different Sb-sources (such as seawater and volcanic rocks), but also kinetic fractionation occurring at low temperature in aqueous media through the reduction of seawater-derived Sb(V) in more reducing environment. Our results suggest that Sb isotopes can be extremely useful tracers of natural processes and may be useful as paleoredox tracers in oceanic systems...|$|R
40|$|Se analizan los depósitos de tormenta de dos secciones estratigráficas de la Formación Vaca Muerta (Tithoniano-Valanginiano) en el área de Bardas Blancas, sur de la provincia de Mendoza. Estos depósitos incluyen: a) depósitos con estratificación entrecruzada de bajo ángulo; b) depósitos con estratificación entrecruzada hummocky de pequeña y gran escala; y c) depósitos laminados con gradación normal intralámina. Las secuencias completas con HCS están compuestas por tres unidades (Sa, Sb y Sc) asociadas al evento de tormenta y una unidad que incluye depósitos de post-tormenta y de buen tiempo (Sd). La comparación con ejemplos actuales y ejemplos del registro, permite estimar un rango batimétrico de 25 a 50 m para los depósitos con estratificación entrecruzada hummocky. Asimismo se discuten posibles orígenes alternativos relacionados con inestabilidades en la interfase de la picnoclina y los efectos de la compactación sobre la preservación de las texturas y estructuras primarias de los depósitos de la Formación Vaca Muerta. Storm {{deposits}} (tempestites) {{have been}} extensively {{studied in the}} sedimentary record, particularly those deposits with hummocky cross-stratification, knowing their bathymetric ranks, facies models and their hydrodynamic conditions (Harms et al., 1975; Dott y Burgeois, 1982; Dumas y Arnott, 2006). However, detailed studies in carbonate sediments are relatively scarce. Recently, other types of interference generated at the picnocline interface (internal waves) were proposed to interpret similar deposits without being controlled by {{the position of the}} of storm-wave level (Pomar et al., 2012). The Tithonian - Valanginian deposits in the southern Mendoza - Neuquén Basin are particularly interesting because of their association with a homoclinal carbonate ramp system. During the Late Jurassic - Early Cretaceous a series of marine sequences were developed throughout the basin that are grouped under the Mendoza Group. In the southern Mendoza area it includes the Vaca Muerta Formation (early Tithonian - early Valanginian), the Chachao Formation (early Valanginian) and the Agrio Formation (early Valanginian - early Barremian) (Figs. 1 and 2). The Vaca Muerta Formation is widely distributed over the entire Neuquén Basin. It consists of dark bituminous shales, marls and limestones deposited in response to a rapid and widespread marine transgression originated from the Pacific Ocean, as consequence of a tectonic phase of compressional relaxation (Legarreta and Uliana, 1991). While initial studies show significant variations in the proportions of different lithologies, sedimentological knowledge is still general, with the exception of contributions from the south of the basin (Spalletti et al., 2000, 2008; Scasso et al., 2002, 2005) and southern Mendoza area (Doyle et al., 2005; Kietzmann et al., 2008, 2011). Storm deposits are well developed in the Vaca Muerta Formation. Based on tempestites characteristics and their associated beds four distinct deposits have been identified in the Bardas Blancas area (Fig. 3) : (1) packstones with low-angle cross-stratification, (2) packstones/grainstones with large scale hummocky cross-stratification, (3) rudstones/grainstones with small scale hummocky cross-stratification, and (4) laminated wackestones/ packstones with intralaminar normal gradation (Figs. 5 and 6). Packstones with low-angle cross-stratification can be interpreted as anisotropic hummocks deposits or low relief megaripples generated under combined flows during major storms in the middle ramp. A complete sequence of HCS consists of three divisions (Sa-Sc) associated with the storm event, and an upper unit (Sd) that represents the fair-weather period between major storm events. Unit Sa starts with an erosion base and consists in low angle cross-stratified rudstones/grainstones. <b>Unit</b> <b>Sb</b> The <b>unit</b> begins with a second order surface and is composed by packstones and grainstones with hummocky cross-stratification. Unit Sc is represented by peloidal packstones with ripple marks, and finally the unit Sd consists of laminated wackestones/packstones. Laminated wackestones/packstones with intra-laminar normal gradation consist of bioclastic wackestones/packstones composed of saccocomids remains or a rhythmic alternation of peloidal packstones and sandy layers with current ripple marks, which probably represents the distal expression of the storms. Variations from this sequence allow us to make some comparison with other ancient carbonate storm deposits (Kreisa, 1981; Monaco 1992, Sami y Descorchers, 1992; Molina et al., 1997; Zhou et al., 2011). Although deposits of the Vaca Muerta Formation are compositionally similar to those described by Molina et al. (1997), the ideal sequence is similar to that recognized by Monaco (1992) (Fig. 10). The division proposed by Monaco (1992) seems to be the most accurate, since {{it is based on the}} recognition of structures generated under different hydrodynamic conditions rather than genetic interpretations associated with the phases of the storm. Comparing the described storm-influenced deposits with ancient and modern storm deposits examples, a relative water depth of 25 to 50 m is estimated for the formation of the HCS limestone facies. Even assuming its origin from internal waves, the position of the pycnocline in warm seas and small basins would be found within the same depth range (Nordberg et al., 2000), so that the deposits described in this paper may be important in future palaeogeographical studies in the Neuquén Basin...|$|R
40|$|Artificial {{lighting}} on {{sea turtle}} nesting beaches repels adult females searching for nest sites and disrupts hatchling seafinding, with potentially substantial effects on nesting activity and hatchling survival. Artificial lighting {{is one of}} a host of anthropogenic threats, including intentional harvest, bycatch in fisheries, interaction with marine debris, and habitat degradation, that have contributed to global sea turtle population declines. Because artificial light on nesting beaches has the potential to impact sea turtle life history stages that are essential to reproductive success, managing artificial lighting is a vital component of nesting beach protection. Furthermore, identifying nesting beach habitat vulnerable to the effects of artificial lighting is critical to guiding conservation efforts that aim to protect sea turtle populations. Green turtles (Chelonia mydas) are classified as endangered globally by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Tortuguero Beach in Costa Rica supports the largest green turtle nesting population in the Western Hemisphere, with more than one hundred thousand green turtle nests laid on the beach every year. The Sea Turtle Conservancy (STC) has monitored and worked to protect the nesting population since 1959, and since 2004, the organization has conducted surveys to monitor artificial lighting on the beach. The primary objective of this project was to support the Sea Turtle Conservancy’s efforts by: 1) Assessing the effect of artificial lighting from adjacent development on green turtle nesting in Tortuguero, 2) Mapping artificial lighting on the beach in order to identify the brightest areas as appropriate targets for light pollution reduction efforts, and 3) Developing a geographic information system (GIS) database to facilitate future monitoring and beach protection by STC. Between June and August 2014, I conducted walking surveys to map the nesting beach and light sources using a Trimble Juno <b>SB</b> GPS <b>unit,</b> and I developed a GIS database that formed the basis for subsequent analyses and data visualization. I built STC’s monitoring data from 2004 through 2014 into a polygon layer of the beach subdivided into mile sections defined by mile markers erected by STC. During the new moon in June and July 2014, I conducted brightness surveys in concert with STC’s light surveys and measured brightness in units of luminance at 50 -meter intervals along the beach using a Unihedron Sky Quality Meter. Using spatial data of the beach and light sources, luminance data from brightness assessments, and monitoring data from STC, I determined a mean luminance value for each mile section, examined the relationship between luminance and nesting activity, and mapped light pollution on the beach. I found that mean luminance and the total number of green turtle emergences per mile section were significantly negatively correlated. Mean luminance exceeded the minimum threshold for light pollution in 6 of the 43 mile sections, and there were significantly fewer emergences in mile sections experiencing light pollution. Mean luminance was highest in mile sections adjacent to Tortuguero Village, where sources of artificial light were concentrated. These findings were consistent with STC’s light survey data, and mean light count and the total number of green turtle emergences per mile section from 2004 to 2014 were also significantly negatively correlated. Cumulatively, these results suggest that artificial lighting from adjacent development impacts green turtle utilization of nesting habitat and changes the spatial distribution of green turtle nesting activity on Tortuguero Beach. These results were consistent with the findings of previous studies conducted on sea turtle nesting beaches and support the need for a turtle-friendly lighting initiative in Tortuguero. Successful management of light pollution on Tortuguero Beach will require a coordinated effort between the Sea Turtle Conservancy, the Costa Rican Electricity Institute (ICE), and local stakeholders. I made the following recommendations for addressing light pollution in Tortuguero: 1) Light pollution management efforts should focus on Tortuguero Village, where the majority of light sources are found and luminance was highest. 2) Light pollution management should involve both restoration of native beachfront vegetation and improvements in lighting technology. 3) Future brightness surveys to document reduction of light pollution in response to STC’s efforts could focus on mile sections adjacent to Tortuguero Village. Brightness data from this study provide a baseline against which to compare future brightness levels on the beach. 4) Targeted monitoring of hatchling disorientation near Tortuguero Village would provide additional insight into artificial lighting impacts on the nesting population and help identify specific lights that continue to be problematic after management actions are taken. </p...|$|R
40|$|Thermoelectric energy (TE) {{conversion}} {{can be used}} {{to create}} electricity from temperature gradients. Hence power can be generated from waste heat using TE materials, e. g. from the exhaust in automotives. This power in turn may lead to a reduction of gas consumption by reducing the alternator load on the engine. Because of the increasing demand and limited availability of energy sources, there is strong and renewed interest in advancing thermoelectric materials. Past research shows that the best TE materials are narrow band gap semiconductors composed of heavy elements, exhibiting a large Seebeck coefficient, S, combined with high electrical conductivity, σ, and low thermal conductivity, κ. Various research projects have been attempted during the past four years of my Ph. D. studies. These include the synthesis, crystal structure studies, electronic structure calculations and thermoelectric properties of transition metal oxides and thallium main group chalcogenides. Because of the good thermal stability, lack of sensitivity to the air, and non-toxicity, transition metal oxides are potential candidates for commercial thermoelectric applications. During the investigation of oxides for thermoelectric application, several interesting features of different transition metal oxides have been discovered: 1. A new quaternary layered transition-metal oxide, Na 2 Cu 2 TeO 6, has been synthesized under air using stoichiometric mixtures of Na 2 CO 3, CuO and TeO 2. Na 2 Cu 2 TeO 6 crystallizes in a new structure type, monoclinic space group C 2 /m with a = 5. 7059 (6) Å, b = 8. 6751 (9) Å, c = 5. 9380 (6) Å,  = 113. 740 (2) °, V = 269. 05 (5) Å 3 and Z = 2, as determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The structure is composed of[Cu 2 TeO 6] layers with the Na atoms located in the octahedral voids between the layers. Na 2 Cu 2 TeO 6 is a green nonmetallic compound, in agreement with the electronic structure calculation and electrical resistance measurement. 2. An n-type narrow band gap semiconductor, LaMo 8 O 14, exhibiting the high Seebeck coefficient of - 94 μVK- 1 at room temperature has been investigated. 3. Pb 0. 69 Mo 4 O 6 with a new modulated structure and stoichiometry was determined from single-crystal X-ray diffraction data. The compound crystallizes in the tetragonal super space group, P 4 /mbm(00 g) 00 ss, with a = 9. 6112 (3) Å, c = 2. 8411 (1) Å, q = 0. 25 c*, which is different from the previously reported structure. As for the research of thermoelectric properties of thallium main group chalcogenides, three new ternary thallium selenides, Tl 2. 35 Sb 8. 65 Se 14, Tl 1. 97 Sb 8. 03 Se 13 and Tl 2. 04 Bi 7. 96 Se 13, have been discovered. All three compounds crystallize in the same space group P 21 /m with different cell parameters, and in part different Wyckoff sites, hence different structure types. The three selenides with similar structures are composed of distorted edge-sharing (Sb,Bi) Se 6 octahedra, while the distorted Tl/(Sb, Bi) sites are coordinated by 8 - 9 Se atoms. Electronic structure calculations and physical property measurements reveal they are semiconductors with high Seebeck coefficient but low electrical conductivity, and therefore not good thermoelectrics. On the other hand, our transport property measurements on the unoptimized Tl 2 SnTe 3 sample show interesting thermoelectric properties of this known compound. Advanced thermoelectrics are dominated by antimonides and tellurides so far. The structures of the tellurides are mostly composed of NaCl-related motifs, hence do not contain any Te–Te bonds. All of the antimonide structures containing Sb–Sb bonds of various lengths are much more complex. The Sb atom substructures are Sb 24 – pairs in β-Zn 4 Sb 3, linear <b>Sb</b> 37 – <b>units</b> in Yb 14 MnSb 11, planar Sb 44 – rectangles in the skutterudites, e. g., LaFe 3 CoSb 12, and Sb 8 cubes interconnected via short Sb–Sb bonds to a three-dimensional network in Mo 3 Sb 5 Te 2. The results of electronic structure calculations suggested that these interactions {{have a significant impact on}} the band gap size as well as on the effective mass around the Fermi level, which represent vital criteria for advanced thermoelectrics. The crystal structure and electronic structure investigation for the unique T net planar Sb–Sb interactions in Hf 5 Sb 9 will be also presented, although Hf 5 Sb 9 is metallic compound with poor thermoelectric performances...|$|R
