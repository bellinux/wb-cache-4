40|$|Diagonal bracing is {{a common}} method used in South Africa for the bracing of timber trussed roofs with spans of less than 9 m. In the typical diagonally braced roof system, the brace {{is placed on the}} {{underside}} of the compression chord, which is as far as it can be placed away from the battens that brace the trusses not directly connected to the diagonal brace. Some of the stiffness of the bracing is lost because the low torsional rigidity of the top chord as well as the batten to top chord nailing is all part of the structural system. In this paper the authors investigate bracing of the entire roof system and contend that it is better to connect the bracing member closer to the battens as this improves the stiffness and bracing ability of the system. The authors study both the diagonal brace as well as the alternative bracing method that uses criss-cross metal strapping, sometimes called <b>speed</b> <b>brace.</b> The <b>speed</b> <b>brace</b> is nailed to the top of the compression chord and is therefore much closer to the battens. Two different truss spans were studied to ascertain the buckling length of the top chord for both the diagonal bracing as well as speed bracing. By moving the bracing system closer to the battens the authors show that the <b>speed</b> <b>brace</b> gives a stiffer system which thereby reduces the buckling length of the top compression chord.

40|$|The paper {{critically}} {{reviews the}} literature concerning {{the effect of}} ankle bracing and taping on vertical jump, agility, running speed, and broad jump performance. MEDLINE, CINAHL and SPORTDiscus were searched for papers published between 1988 and June 2003. The following keywords were used: performance, running, jump, agility, <b>speed,</b> <b>brace,</b> orthotic devices, tape, taping, ankle. References of retrieved articles were screened for additional relevant studies. Studies were eligible if they reported {{on the effect of}} an ankle support on vertical jump, running, agility or broad jump. Only studies that were written as full reports and had been published in the English language were included. Data on the effect of the ankle support on vertical jump, running speed, agility and/or broad jump performance were abstracted from the text and tables. Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Of twelve studies looking at vertical jump, four found a negative effect on the vertical jump using different types of ankle braces or adhesive tape. One study found a negative effect on running speed; three studies found a negative effect on time to complete an agility course. In one study, broad jump performance was shown to be adversely affected while wearing a brace. In two studies subjects with ankle injuries completed the agility course faster when wearing an ankle brace. The majority of studies indicated that ankle bracing or taping has no effect or only a minor effect on vertical jump height, running speed, agility and broad jump in athletes with stable ankles. Further study is necessary to examine the effect of prolonged ankle brace use on athletic performance. In addition, more research is necessary to investigate the effect of an ankle support in subjects with an ankle injury. Keywords: Bot S, Verhagen E, van Mechelen...|$|E
30|$|The {{drive shaft}} is very {{important}} in many fields, such as robotic design, force measurement system, and vessel [1 – 5]. It is an indispensable part of an automotive transmission system with the feature of high rotation <b>speed,</b> and less <b>bracing</b> transmits torque in the operation of a vehicle. When the vehicle starts, runs, decelerates, and brakes, the greater the torque of the shaft is, the more serious it has an influence on the performance of the vehicle. Accordingly, real-time monitoring of the status of the torque of the shaft has a great influence on the finding out the faults of the drive shaft in time.|$|R
5000|$|Both the {{turbocharged}} 16v/4cylinder and 20v/5cylinder (4v per cyl.) versions were {{equipped with}} a very efficient Viscodrive limited-slip differential to counter the understeer that plagues most powerful front wheel drive cars. Additionally, the coupe featured independent suspension all round: at the front MacPherson struts and lower wishbones anchored to an auxiliary crossbeam, offset coil springs and anti roll bar; at the rear, trailing arms mounted on an auxiliary subframe, coil springs and an anti roll bar.1998 saw {{the release of the}} Limited Edition which featured red Brembo brake calipers at the front and standard red calipers at the back, a body kit, push-button start, six <b>speed</b> gearbox, strut <b>brace</b> to make the chassis more rigid and Recaro seats with red leather inserts which offered better support than the standard 20VT seats.|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} a knee brace {{to measure the}} knee angle and implicitly the flexion/extension (f/e) of the knee joint during daily activities. The goal {{of this study is}} to classify and validate a limited set of physical activities on ten young healthy subjects based on knee f/e. Physical activities included in this study are walking, ascending and descending of stairs, and fast locomotion (such as jogging, running, and sprinting) at self-selected <b>speeds.</b> The knee <b>brace</b> includes 2 accelerometers for static measurements and calibration and an inductive sensor for dynamic measurements. Aswe focus on physical activities, the inductive sensorwill provide the required information on knee f/e. In this study, the subjects traversed a predefined track which consisted of indoor paths, outdoor paths, and obstacles. The activity classification algorithm based on peak detection in the knee f/e angle resulted in a detection rate of 95. 9 % for walking, 90. 3 % for ascending stairs, 78. 3 % for descending stairs, and 82. 2 % for fast locomotion. We conclude that we {{developed a}} measurement device which allows long-termand ambulatorymonitoring. Furthermore, it is possible to predict the aforementioned activities with an acceptable performance. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Background: we {{investigated}} how ruptured Achilles tendons are loaded in a brace. There {{is an ongoing}} discussion whether patients should be recommended to bear weight on the injuredlimb. However, {{little is known about}} the effects of bracing on tensional loading of the healing Achilles tendon: it is uncertain if load-bearing actually stresses the Achilles tendon inside a brace. Methods: we measured plantar flexion moment inside the brace, in order to estimate tensional loading of the tendon, by use of an insole with pressure transducers. Results: after wearing the brace for 1 hour, young healthy individuals reduced their maximum flexion moment during gait by half. Patients with Achilles tendon rupture showed no measurable flexion moment during gait with the brace, 4 or 7 weeks after injury. Only when specifically instructed, they could produce a considerable plantar flexion moment. We noted that gait <b>speed</b> with the <b>brace</b> at 4 weeks correlated with a heel-raise functional test at 1 year: the higher the spontaneous gait speed, the less the functional difference between the injured and the uninjured leg (r 2 = 0. 68; p= 0. 002). Conclusion: the correlation with gait speed suggests that the patients’ general physical aptness has an impact on the end result...|$|R
5000|$|After the Blades 2-0 {{defeat at}} home to Charlton Athletic on 1 March 2008, Blackwell was {{critical}} of his team's performance, describing it as [...] "insipid" [...] and [...] "embarrassing" [...] {{in an interview on}} BBC Radio Sheffield. Since then, the team went on a five-game unbeaten run drawing at Ipswich Town and winning four in a row against Plymouth Argyle, Coventry City, Norwich City and Barnsley to improve his chances of landing the job permanently. The 4-match winning streak ended to a 3-1 defeat against Preston North End. The team responded with a 3-0 victory against Leicester City, James Beattie scored his first hat-trick of the club in that game. In his first Sheffield derby as manager, the Blades showed much improved passion levels as they came from 2-0 down against Sheffield Wednesday to draw 2-2 with Beattie scoring a stunning free kick very late in the game to rescue a point. This was followed by a 2-1 victory at Burnley, with another superb Beattie free kick, and a 2-0 victory over Hull when United went down to ten men after skipper Chris Morgan was sent off. In the penultimate game of the season, the Blades won 2-1 against Bristol City with <b>Speed</b> scoring a <b>brace.</b> With one game remaining in the season, United remained in with a chance of making the play offs, a considerable achievement after the Robson era. Sheffield United lost 3-2 {{on the last day of}} the season against Southampton and finished ninth, four points off the final playoff place.|$|R
