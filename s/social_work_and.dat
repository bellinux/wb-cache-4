He was relieved of his directorship at Boston Psychopathic and named director of the Massachusetts Psychiatric Institute, a unit of Boston Psychopathic. Free of his previous hospital administration duties, Southard was able to concentrate on research. Southard delineated several priorities for his scientific work and writing. He hoped to publish four books; the first would cover observations from his research laboratory made between 1906 and 1919. The second book, on clinical work he had done at Boston Psychopathic since 1912, he hoped would increase enthusiasm for psychiatric hospitals. The third would report on the expansion of psychiatric <b>social</b> <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> the final work (a requirement for his academic post) would be an overview of neuropathology.|$|E

40|$|In 2011, Advances in <b>Social</b> <b>Work</b> {{published}} {{results from}} {{an investigation into}} the explicit use of “prevention” language within the <b>social</b> <b>work</b> profession. Findings from this study highlighted a gap in the knowledge and integration of prevention-focused <b>social</b> <b>work</b> education <b>and</b> practice. A recommendation was made to examine additional indicators that illustrate the extent to which “prevention” is an accepted and growing subfield within the <b>social</b> <b>work</b> academy. This second paper continues the inquiry by examining three additional indicators for integration of prevention content, including: 1) CSWE accredited MSW programs; 2) <b>social</b> <b>work</b> textbooks; <b>and</b> 3) abstracts accepted at two national <b>social</b> <b>work</b> conferences. Although findings demonstrate that about a quarter of MSW programs integrate prevention content into their curriculum {{there is a lack of}} prevention content available within <b>social</b> <b>work</b> textbooks <b>and</b> professional conferences for <b>social</b> <b>work</b> scholars <b>and</b> practitioners.

40|$|The {{multicultural}} {{reality in}} the United States entails a harsh reality of oppressions and various forms of socio-economic injustice.

40|$|Page 131 is blank {{from the}} {{original}} copyThe research project involved an analysis of <b>social</b> <b>work</b> education <b>and</b> training policies and programmes within a statuatory welfare agency in New Zealand (the Department of Social Welfare). A functionalist epistemology and methodology {{was used to examine}} the Department's inservice <b>social</b> <b>work</b> training policies <b>and</b> programmes. It is argued that there are four central elements to address in <b>social</b> <b>work</b> education <b>and</b> training: the theoretical base, the knowledge base, skills training, and personal development. It is also argued that <b>social</b> <b>work</b> education <b>and</b> training should be informed by empirical study of the nature of <b>social</b> <b>work</b> practice. The thesis states that an analysis of inservice <b>social</b> <b>work</b> education <b>and</b> training policies and programmes would reveal that <b>social</b> <b>work</b> training within the Department of Social Welfare is: reactive to Issues of the day; comprised of a 'patchwork' of unco-ordinated elements; and is centred on meeting the needs of the agency, rather than systematically preparing social workers for practice. It was found that inservice <b>social</b> <b>work</b> training policies <b>and</b> programmes within the Department of Social Welfare were not based on an explicit theoretical perspective, nor were they grounded in empirical study of the nature of <b>social</b> <b>work</b> practice. Further, the analysis indicated that the four elements of <b>social</b> <b>work</b> education were unevenly covered on training courses and that theory and practice were not integrated.
