5|$|On 28 December 1963, {{submarine}} activity 2.5km (1.5mi) to {{the northeast}} of Surtsey caused {{the formation of a}} ridge 100m (328ft) high on the sea floor. This seamount was named Surtla, but never reached <b>sea</b> <b>level.</b> Eruptions at Surtla ended on 6 January 1964, and it has since been eroded from its minimum depth of 23m (75ft) to 47m (154ft) below <b>sea</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{exposure}} of Kiribati {{to changes in}} <b>sea</b> <b>levels</b> is exacerbated by the Pacific decadal oscillation, which is a climate switch phenomenon that results in changes from periods of La Niña to periods of El Niño. This {{has an effect on}} <b>sea</b> <b>levels.</b> For example, in 2000 there was a switch from periods of downward pressure of El Niño on <b>sea</b> <b>levels</b> to an upward pressure of La Niña on <b>sea</b> <b>levels,</b> which upward pressure causes more frequent and higher high tide levels. The Perigean spring tide (often called a king tide) can result in seawater flooding low-lying areas of the islands of Kiribati.|$|R
5|$|Over {{the last}} twelve {{thousand}} years {{the most significant}} new geological features have been the deposits of peat {{and the development of}} coastal alluvium. Post-glacial rises in <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> have been combined with isostatic rises of the land resulting in a relative fall in <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> in most areas. In some places, such as Culbin in Moray, these changes in relative <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> have created a complex series of shorelines. A rare type of Scottish coastline found largely in the Hebrides consists of machair habitat, a low lying dune pasture land formed as the <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> dropped leaving a raised beach. In the present day, Scotland continues to move slowly north.|$|E

The species has been {{captured}} from depths between 400 and 750 meters below <b>sea</b> <b>level,</b> and a 2009 study found the species most heavily concentrated between 400 and 600 meters below <b>sea</b> <b>level.</b> V. togatas conservation status has not been assessed.|$|E
50|$|The {{landscape}} of Lebanon has {{been subject to}} volcanic eruptions, tectonic plate movement, and the rising and dropping of <b>sea</b> <b>levels.</b> The Late Cretaceous was characterized by very high <b>sea</b> <b>levels.</b> During that time fossil-bearing limestone was formed.|$|R
40|$|While <b>sea</b> <b>levels</b> {{are known}} to {{oscillate}} with multi-decadal periodicities worldwide up to quasi- 60 years, the most part {{of the literature on}} <b>sea</b> <b>levels</b> computes apparent rates of rise of <b>sea</b> <b>levels</b> much larger than the legitimate by using short time windows covering only part of a valleyto- peak quasi- 60 year multi-decadal oscillation. It is shown that along the North Atlantic coast of the United States the <b>sea</b> <b>levels</b> oscillate closely to the AMO index, and the rate of rise of <b>sea</b> <b>levels</b> computed by linear fitting of the last 30 - 36 years of data is much higher than the true value. It is also shown that similar minimum requirement of 60 years of recording is needed along the North Pacific coast of the US, where the longer periodicity of the oscillations is not clearly defined; possibly for the strong ENSO signal covering a quasi- 60 years oscillation...|$|R

5|$|Chatteris is {{situated}} between Huntingdon, St Ives, Peterborough, March and Ely, {{in the middle}} of The Fens—the lowest-lying area in the United Kingdom—with most of the land surrounding the town being below <b>sea</b> <b>level,</b> although the highest point in the Fens (36 feet above <b>sea</b> <b>level)</b> is within Chatteris's parish boundaries. The peaty land surrounding the town is largely used for agriculture, drained by numerous ditches and dykes, and there are two large drainage rivers near the town – the Forty Foot Drain, also known as Vermuyden's Drain, and the Sixteen Foot Drain.|$|E
5|$|Darwin's theory {{followed}} {{from his}} understanding that coral polyps {{thrive in the}} clean seas of the tropics where the water is agitated, but can only live within a limited depth of water, starting just below low tide. Where {{the level of the}} underlying land stays the same, the corals grow around the coast to form what he called fringing reefs, and can eventually grow out from the shore to become a barrier reef. Where the land is rising, fringing reefs can grow around the coast, but coral raised above <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> dies and becomes white limestone. If the land subsides slowly, the fringing reefs keep pace by growing upwards on a base of dead coral, and form a barrier reef enclosing a lagoon between the reef and the land. A barrier reef can encircle an island, and once the island sinks below <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> a roughly circular atoll of growing coral continues {{to keep up with the}} <b>sea</b> <b>level,</b> forming a central lagoon. Should the land subside too quickly or <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> rise too fast, the coral dies as it is below its habitable depth.|$|E

50|$|Over {{the last}} million years <b>sea</b> <b>levels</b> have changed significantly. 800,000 years ago <b>sea</b> <b>levels</b> {{were likely to}} have been 35m higher than now.

5|$|East Antarctica {{is a cold}} {{region with}} a ground base above <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> and {{occupies}} most of the continent. This area is dominated by small accumulations of snowfall which becomes ice and thus eventually seaward glacial flows.

However, increased ice outflow has been suggested in some regions.|$|E

These headwaters are located a short distance south of County Route 650 (Libertyville Road) roughly halfway between the hamlet of Libertville in Wantage Township and Sussex Borough. The stream flows into Lake Neepaulin located at 509ft (155 m) above <b>sea</b> <b>level.</b> The man-made lake, created through damming, is the centre of a private residential development. It flows southeast from the lake's dam in the southeast direction for another 1.5 miles (2.4km) before flowing into Papakating Creek. It enters Papakating Creek at 395 feet (120 m) above <b>sea</b> <b>level</b> approximately 2.5 miles (4km) upstream of that creek's junction with the Wallkill River at a location directly south of Sussex Borough along County Route 565 near the hamlet of Lewisburg in Wantage Township and near Sussex Airport.|$|E
