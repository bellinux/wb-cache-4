40|$|Among {{various factors}} {{affecting}} the space weather {{effects of a}} coronal mass ejection (CME), its propagation trajectory in the <b>interplanetary</b> <b>space</b> {{is an important one}} determining whether and when the CME will hit the Earth. Many direct observations have revealed that a CME may not propagate along a straight trajectory in the corona, but whether or not a CME also experiences a deflected propagation in the <b>interplanetary</b> <b>space</b> is a question, which has never been fully answered. Here by investigating the propagation process of an isolated CME from the corona to <b>interplanetary</b> <b>space</b> during 2008 September 12 [...] 19, we present solid evidence that the CME was deflected not only in the corona but also in the <b>interplanetary</b> <b>space.</b> The deflection angle in the <b>interplanetary</b> <b>space</b> is more than 20 degrees toward the west, resulting a significant change in the probability the CME encounters the Earth. A further modeling and simulation-based analysis suggest that the cause of the deflection in the <b>interplanetary</b> <b>space</b> is the interaction between the CME and the solar wind, which is different from that happening in the corona.

5000|$|The Turbo-Toilet 2000 - A giant toilet {{created by}} George and Harold, who was accidentally {{brought into the}} real world with a {{modified}} photocopier. His plan was to devour Captain Underpants and conquer the world with his army of vicious Talking Toilets, but he was defeated and flown to Uranus; in the fourth book, in the newspaper Professor Poopypants was holding, one of the articles states that there were talking toilets found on Uranus and the [...] "Piqua Order Of Professional <b>Space</b> <b>Interplanetary</b> Explorers" [...] (POOPSIE) later discovered the talking toilets on Uranus yet again In Book 7. It is also a running gag in the book series that bad guys get sent to Uranus. He came back to life and he gets defeated by two different people in two different universes. In the first universe, George, Harold, and Captain Underpants were on a big adventure traveling through time with Tippy Tinkletrousers. Melvin enjoyed this until the Turbo Toilet 2000 arrived and ruined his experiment. Angered, after Melvin yells at him to be quiet, the Turbo Toilet 2000 chases Melvin all the way over to the school, where Melvin finds one of Mr. Krupp's recently clipped-off toenails from the day before. He gets the idea of extracting it into DNA and transferring Mr. Krupp (Captain Underpants)'s superpowers to himself. He ends up doing so and defeating the Turbo Toilet 2000. In the second universe, George and Harold have created duplicates of themselves and have three of Crackers' and Sulu's eggs. When the Turbo Toilet 2000 arrives, The Georges and Harolds run to the asylum to try to get to Mr. Krupp, but after having been unsuccessful, the group take some cardboard boxes and outdoor grills to create talking toilet disguises. George and Harold climb in the disguises, which fools the Turbo Toilet 2000, and manage to convince him to break down the wall of the asylum. With the snap of every finger, George then turned Mr. Krupp back into Captain Underpants, who prepared to fight against the Turbo Toilet 2000. Captain Underpants ends up winning the fight, but after that the Turbo Toilet 2000 starts crying and his giant tears fall on his head, he turns back into Mr. Krupp once again. After being grabbed by the Turbo Toilet, Mr. Krupp decides to direct the planetary privy towards George and Harold's treehouse, where Yesterday George and Yesterday Harold are. After making it there, the Turbo Toilet opens his mouth and swallows Mr. Krupp whole, and then proceeds to ram the base of the treehouse. In the chaos, Cracker's eggs fall to the ground with a sonic boom and a terrible [...] "CRASH!" [...] As Yesterday George and Yesterday Harold sift through the broken eggshell fragments, they discover that Cracker's children are half-pterodactyl, half-hamster. The Turbo Toilet grabs Yesterday George and Harold, but the hamster-pterodactyl children save them by lifting the Turbo Toilet up, and shattering him with a deafening [...] "BOOM!" [...] The hamsterdactyls are later called Orlando, Tony and Dawn. A variation of the Turbo Toilet 2000 appears in the movie created by Melvin, and modified by Professor Poopypants.|$|E

40|$|Future {{exploration}} missions will be {{the first}} time humanity travels beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO) since the Apollo program, taking us to cis-lunar <b>space,</b> <b>interplanetary</b> space, and Mars. These long-duration missions will cover vast distances, severely constraining opportunities for emergency evacuation to Earth and cargo resupply opportunities. Communication delays and blackouts between the crew and Mission Control will eliminate reliable, real-time telemedicine consultations. As a result, compared to current LEO operations onboard the International Space Station, exploration mission medical care requires an integrated medical system that provides additional in-situ capabilities and a significant increase in crew autonomy. The Medical System Concept of Operations for Mars Exploration Missions illustrates how a future NASA Mars program could ensure appropriate medical care for the crew of this highly autonomous mission.

40|$|This work {{involves}} a conceptual assessment {{for using the}} toroidal fusion reactor for deep <b>space</b> <b>interplanetary</b> and interstellar missions. Toroidal thermonuclear fusion reactors, such as tokamaks and stellarators, are unique for space propulsion, allowing for a design with the magnetic configuration localized inside toroidal magnetic field coils. Plasma energetic ions, including charged fusion products, can escape such a closed configuration at certain conditions, {{a result of the}} vertical drift in toroidal rippled magnetic field. Escaping particles can be used for direct propulsion (since toroidal drift is directed one way vertically) or to create and heat externally confined plasma, so that the latter can be used for propulsion. Deuterium-tritium fusion neutrons with an energy of 14. 1 MeV also can be used for direct propulsion. A special design allows neutrons to escape the shield and the blanket of the tokamak. This provides a direct (partial) conversion of the fusion energy into the directed motion of the propellant. In contrast to other fusion concepts proposed for space propulsion, this concept utilizes the natural drift motion of charged particles out of the closed magnetic field configuration...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} an experimental scenario for testing a novel method to measure distance and proper motion of astronomical sources. The method {{is based on}} multi-epoch observations of amplitude or intensity correlations between separate receiving systems. This technique is called Interferometric Parallax, and efficiently exploits phase information that has traditionally been overlooked. The test case we discuss combines amplitude correlations of signals from deep <b>space</b> <b>interplanetary</b> spacecraft with those from distant galactic and extragalactic radio sources {{with the goal of}} estimating the interplanetary spacecraft distance. Interferometric parallax relies on the detection of wavefront curvature effects in signals collected by pairs of separate receiving systems. The method shows promising potentialities over current techniques when the target is unresolved from the background reference sources. Developments in this field might lead to the construction of an independent, geometrical cosmic distance ladder using a dedicated project and future generation instruments. We present a conceptual overview supported by numerical estimates of its performances applied to a spacecraft orbiting the Solar System. Simulations support the feasibility of measurements with a simple and time-saving observational scheme using current facilities...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an unusual tuning fork chopper {{in the development}} of which several significant advances were made. The specific application was in an infrared radiation experimental package on a deep <b>space</b> (<b>interplanetary)</b> -vehicle. However similar devices can be applied generally in other optical systems, wherever it is desired to modulate incoming radiation while sequentially directing the beam to two or more instruments. Radiation need not be in the infrared portion of the spectrum but can be any wavelength capable of being reflected by a mirror. The basic requirement for the infrared package was a device which could modulate the incoming radiation by chopping a direct path to one instrument and provide a reflected path of image quality to a second instrument. The tuning fork device described hereafter ac-complishes this dual function. It is basically a tuning fork chopper which, in addition to the usual modulating function, also serves as a beam splitter. In place of the usual blackened vanes this chopper carries a pair of vanes which have a high quality mirror surface. Because the radiation level would often be very low it was essential that very precise control of the aperture be maintained and that heat input to the vanes be avoided. Also, reactive forces to the experiments ' optical bench had to be minimized and the device's mag-netic field shielded. The unit described herein is basically similar to Bulova's proprietary Type L 40 tuning fork choppers with modifications to meet the optical requirements and operation in a deep space environment. It was made for Texas Instrument Corporation for incorporation in an infrared interferometer-spectrometer package in the Mariner space vehicle for the Jupiter /Saturn /Uranus mission.

40|$|The Sun is at {{the centre}} {{of our solar system}} and it is {{constantly}} ejecting a flow of plasma outward into interplanetary space. This flow can take the form of two primary types; the fast solar wind; and the slow solar wind. The Sun may also eject plasma with more dynamic events which cause high density clouds of plasma to travel alongside the solar wind. In the modern world, a number of different techniques have been developed to study the solar wind from the Earth and also in interplanetary <b>space.</b> <b>Interplanetary</b> scintillation (IPS) is a technique that has been applied at Aberystwyth University to observe the continual density variations in the solar wind by observing a distant astronomical radio source and the scintillation of its radio waves as they pass through the solar wind. To perform this, a number of radio sites around the world have been used such as the European Incoherent SCATter radar (EISCAT) in northern Scandinavia, and the ever growing LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) based in the Netherlands. The IPS technique has also proved to be highly complementary with Heliospheric Imagers (HIs) onboard the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) spacecraft which detect the white light which has been scattered by the solar wind particles. This thesis investigates the solar wind using a wide variety of techniques to observe the small- and large-scale structures which form in the solar wind. A study of IPS in 2007 and 2008 detected numerous events of rapid velocity variations which occurred in the slow solar wind. This showed evidence that the slow solar wind may have a ?blobular? nature formed of many small-scale transients as well as the large-scale transients which are already well known to us. In November 2011 LOFAR observed its first coronal mass ejection (CME) while observing IPS. This event proved to become of interest as it was successfully detected by a number of different techniques and could modeled and tracked accurately as it propagated outward to Earth?s orbit and even interacted with the Earth?s magnetosphere. A technique which could be applied to coronagraph observation separated the dynamic and quiescent solar wind structures from the images. The quiescent component became the basis {{for the development of a}} new solar wind model which could quickly and accurately map the background quiescent solar wind free from any of the complexities cause by CMEs...|$|E

They record impacts of micrometeoroids in the ecliptic plane at heliocentric distances from 0. 7 to 5. 4 AU and in a plane almost perpendicular to the ecliptic from - 79 deg to + 79 deg ecliptic latitude. The combination of both Ulysses and Galileo measurements yields information about the radial and latitudinal distributions of micron- and sub-micron-sized dust in the Solar System. Two types of dust particles were found to dominate the dust flux in interplanetary <b>space.</b> <b>Interplanetary</b> micrometeoroids covering a wide mass range from 10 ^- 16 to 10 ^- 6 g are recorded mostly inside 3 AU and at latitudes below 30 deg. Interstellar grains with masses between 10 ^- 14 and 10 ^- 12 g have been positively identified outside 3 AU near the ecliptic plane and outside 1. 8 AU at high ecliptic latitudes (> 50 deg). Interstellar grains move on hyperbolic trajectories through the planetary system and constitute the dominant dust flux (1. 5 x 10 ^- 4 m^- 2 sec^- 1) in the outer Solar System and at high ecliptic latitudes. To compare and analyze the Galileo and Ulysses data sets, a new model is developed based on J. Geophys. Res. 98, 17029 - 17048, Divine's (1993, ``five populations of interplanetary meteoroids'' model. Both models describe the interplanetary meteoroid environment in terms of dust populations on distinct orbits. Taking into account the measured velocities {{and the effect of}} radiation pressure on small particles (described by the ratio of radiation pressure force to gravity, beta), we define four populations of meteoroids on elliptical orbits and one population on hyperbolic orbit that can fit the micrometeoroid flux observed by Galileo and Ulysses. Micrometeoroids with masses greater than 10 ^- 10 g and negligible radiation pressure (beta = 0) orbit the Sun on low to moderately eccentric orbits and with low inclinations (<= 30 deg). Populations of smaller particles with mean masses of 10 ^- 11 g (beta = 0. 3), 10 ^- 13 g (beta = 0. 8), and 5 x 10 ^- 15 g (beta = 0. 3), respectively, have components with high eccentricities and have increasingly wider inclination distributions with decreasing mass. Similarities among the orbit distributions of the small particle populations on bound orbits suggest that all are genetically related and are part of an overall micrometeoroid complex that prevails in the inner Solar System. The high-eccentricity component of the small particle populations may actually be beta-meteoroids which are not well characterized by our measurements. Our modeling suggests further that the interstellar dust flux is not reduced at Ulysses' perihelion distance (1. 3 AU) and that it contributes about 30 % of the total dust flux observed there...|$|E
