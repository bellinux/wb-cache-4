50|$|The main {{breeding}} {{areas are}} the north German heathland and moors of the Lüneburg Heath. That said, this sheep, which {{is easy to}} look after, may nowadays be found {{in all parts of}} Europe, mainly because of its meat which has a gamey flavour. Some breeds are classed as domestic <b>species</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>with</b> <b>extinction</b> so their preservation is subsidised within the European Union.|$|E

5000|$|The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) also affords {{the birds}} protection.

Besides establishing obligations for each State joining the Convention, CMS promotes concerted action among the Range States {{of many of these}} species.|$|E
50|$|Peristeria elata is the {{national}} flower of Panama and is extremely over-collected in its native habitat. This over collection has led to {{its status as a}} <b>species</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>with</b> <b>extinction</b> delineated in Appendix I of CITES. In its native habitat, Peristeria can usually be found growing near the edge of hardwood forests. In the fall, after the trees in the hardwood forest lose their leaves, the plants are exposed to full sun throughout the cool, dry winter. Species in this genus are either epiphytic or terrestrial in growth habit.|$|E
5000|$|On {{a global}} level, the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS, or the [...] "Bonn Convention") is a {{multilateral}} treaty {{specializing in the}} conservation of migratory species, their habitats and migration routes. CMS has listed the North Atlantic right whale on Appendix I, which identifies it as a migratory <b>species</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>with</b> <b>extinction.</b> [...] This obligates member nations to strive towards strict protection of these animals, habitat conservation or restoration, mitigation of obstacles to migration, and control of other factors that might endanger them.|$|E

50|$|With over 2500 {{indigenous}} {{plant species}} the Peninsula is exceptionally rich even by Cape Floral standards. By comparison, the United Kingdom has 1200 species of plants, the Kruger National Park has about 1980 species and Namibia has 3960 species. Additionally {{there are very}} few cities on earth with 150 plant <b>species</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>with</b> <b>extinction,</b> let alone in a single vegetation type within their borders (Cape Flats Sand Fynbos). Despite its remarkable species richness in a small area, Tokai Park is adjacent to a large conservation area, the World Heritage Site Table Mountain National Park (SANParks), and thus is not an isolated fragment and avoids associated management problems.|$|E
50|$|Procellariiformes {{have had}} a long {{relationship}} with humans. They have been important food sources for many people, {{and continue to be}} hunted as such {{in some parts of the}} world. The albatrosses in particular have been the subject of numerous cultural depictions. Procellariiformes are one of the most endangered bird taxa, with many <b>species</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>with</b> <b>extinction</b> due to introduced predators in their breeding colonies, marine pollution and the danger of fisheries by-catch. Scientists, conservationists, fishermen, and governments around the world are working to reduce the threats posed to them, and these efforts have led to the signing of the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels, a legally binding international treaty signed in 2001.|$|E
50|$|Until recently, most of Tokai Park {{was under}} plantation. However the lease of Tokai Park by MTO Forestry expires in 2025, and {{the removal of}} the last of the {{commercial}} plantations has been followed by restoration efforts by South African National Parks and other conservation organisations. Today Tokai Park has over 110 plant <b>species</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>with</b> <b>extinction</b> or extinct in the wild and restored at Tokai. Perhaps the best known example of a species that is extinct in the wild, but which is recovering at Tokai Park is Erica verticillata. More than 300 plant species have already naturally returned. Additionally wildlife such as Cape Fox, Porcupine and Caracal are now recorded here.|$|E

50|$|Today many animal <b>species</b> are <b>threatened</b> <b>with</b> <b>extinction</b> to a {{great extent}} because of {{increasing}} threats to their natural habitat.Zoos do not only keep such species in their custody with a view to maintaining ex situ reserve populations, but they increasingly link their ex situ activities with conservation projects in the field (“in situ”).|$|R
50|$|Twycross Zoo has around 500 {{animals of}} almost 150 species, {{including}} many endangered species. Renowned as a specialist primate zoo, {{it is the}} only zoo in the UK where you can see the bonobo, and the only place with all four types of great ape: gorilla, orangutan, chimpanzee and bonobo. The zoo currently houses four orangutans, five gorillas, 20 chimpanzees and 13 bonobos. Twycross Zoo has one of the largest collections of gibbons in Europe, and 37% of their animal collection is classed as near threatened, vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered by the IUCN. Many of the animals at Twycross Zoo are part of conservation breeding programmes which help ensure a future for <b>species</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>with</b> <b>extinction.</b>|$|E
50|$|Under the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES), species {{listed under}} Appendix I are {{threatened}} with extinction, and commercial trade in wild-caught specimens, or products derived from them, is prohibited. This rule {{applies to all}} <b>species</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>with</b> <b>extinction,</b> except in exceptional circumstances. Commercial trade of endangered species listed under Appendix II and III is not prohibited, although Parties must provide non-detriment finding {{to show that the}} species in the wild is not being unsustainably harvested for the purpose of trade. Specimens of Appendix I species that were bred in captivity for commercial purposes are treated as Appendix II. An example of this is captive-bred saltwater crocodiles, with some wild populations listed in Appendix I and others in Appendix II.|$|E
50|$|Since 2015, EKOSPOL {{has been}} the general sponsor of ZOO Tabor. This ZOO is {{focusing}} on animal <b>species</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>with</b> <b>extinction</b> either in Czech Republic or all over the world.

EKOSPOL is cooperating {{on one of the}} pilot projects of Česká krajina, which is the intention to return the European bison into wild nature. EKOSPOL is also supporting a civic association Společnost pro zvířata which is focusing on animal protection - especially help for animals in need, prevention of animal suffering, etc. Společnost pro zvířata is also trying to make a contribution to leading the human society to better relationship with animals and more considerate approach towards animals in general.|$|E

50|$|By 1970 it was {{apparent}} that federal responsibility was required for further wildlife management issues, such as mammals crossing the International Boundary with the United States, as well as Canada's maritime borders with France (St. Pierre and Miquelon), Denmark (Greenland), Russia and Norway. There were also serious problems mounting whereby increasing numbers of wildlife <b>species</b> were <b>threatened</b> <b>with</b> <b>extinction.</b>|$|R
50|$|Loss of {{biodiversity}} {{can be attributed}} largely to the appropriation of land for agroforestry {{and the effects of}} climate change. The 2008 IUCN Red List warns that long-term droughts and extreme weather puts additional stress on key habitats and, for example, lists 1,226 bird <b>species</b> as <b>threatened</b> <b>with</b> <b>extinction,</b> which is one-in-eight of all bird species.|$|R
