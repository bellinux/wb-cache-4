500|$|But Shankly soon regretted his {{decision}} {{and tried to}} continue his involvement with the club, mainly by turning up for team training at Melwood. He said he still wanted the involvement as the club had become his life. He soon stopped going to Melwood because he felt there was some resentment and people were asking {{what he was doing}} there. He felt unwanted, but [...] "I never resented the club after I left, as <b>some</b> <b>stupid</b> person wrote in the paper." [...] He still attended matches, but sat in the stand away from the directors and staff. He was especially annoyed that Liverpool did not invite him to attend away matches as the club's guest. When, finally, he was invited to travel with them to the away leg of the 1976 UEFA Cup Final in Bruges, he was accommodated in a separate hotel and said he found that insulting. Shankly contrasted Liverpool's attitude with what he encountered at other clubs, including Liverpool's great rivals Everton and Manchester United, where he was received warmly. He recalled Manchester United manager Tommy Docherty's reply to a Liverpool director: [...] "Aye, Bill's welcome here". About Everton, once his greatest rivals, he wrote: [...] "I have been received more warmly by Everton than I have by Liverpool. It is a scandal that I must write these words about the club I helped to build".|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{stated that}} Moore [...] "has the {{superficial}} attributes for the job: The urbanity, the quizzically raised eyebrow, the calm under fire and in bed". However, {{he felt that}} Moore wasn't satisfactory in living up to the legacy left by Sean Connery in the preceding films. He rated the villains [...] "a little banal", adding that the film [...] "doesn't have a Bond villain worthy of the Goldfingers, Dr. Nos and Oddjobs of the past." [...] Chris Nashawaty similarly argues that Dr. Kananga/Mr. Big is the worst villain of the Roger Moore James Bond films. BBC Films reviewer William Mager praised the use of locations, but said that the plot was [...] "convoluted". He stated that [...] "Connery and Lazenby had an air of concealed thuggishness, clenched fists at the ready, but in Moore's case a sardonic quip and a raised eyebrow are his deadliest weapons". Reviewer Leonard Maltin rated the film {{two and a half}} stars out of four, describing it as a [...] "barely memorable, overlong James Bond movie" [...] that [...] "seems merely an excuse to film wild chase sequences". Danny Peary noted that Jane Seymour portrays [...] "one of the Bond series's most beautiful heroines" [...] but had little praise for Moore, whom he described as making [...] "an unimpressive debut as James Bond in Tom Mankiewicz's unimaginative adaptation of Ian Fleming's second novel…The movie stumbles along most of the way. It's hard to remember Moore is playing Bond at times – in fact, if he and Seymour were black, the picture could pass as one of the black exploitation films of the day. There are few interesting action sequences – a motorboat chase is trite enough to begin with, but the filmmakers make it worse by throwing in <b>some</b> <b>stupid</b> Louisiana cops, including pot-bellied Sheriff Pepper." ...|$|E

I don't want them to be fans." [...] The statue was removed by the club's new owners in 2013; Al-Fayed blamed the club's subsequent relegation from the Premier League on the 'bad luck' brought by its removal. Al-Fayed then donated the statue to the National Football Museum.|$|E

Rozanov's daughter, Tatyana, stated in her memoirs: [...] "Suslova mocked him, saying {{that what he was}} writing were just <b>some</b> <b>stupid</b> books, she insulted him, and finally dumped him". Suslova broke up with Rozanov twice, but he always forgave her and begged to return home. After they finally parted, Rozanov admitted: [...] "There was something brilliant (in her temperament) that made me love her blindly and timidly despite all the suffering." ...|$|E
2500|$|At Wittgenstein's insistence, Moore, {{who was now}} a Cambridge don, {{visited him}} in Norway in 1914, reluctantly because Wittgenstein {{exhausted}} him. David Edmonds and John Eidinow write that Wittgenstein regarded Moore, an internationally known philosopher, {{as an example of}} how far someone could get in life with [...] "absolutely no intelligence whatever." [...] In Norway it was clear that Moore was expected to act as Wittgenstein's secretary, taking down his notes, with Wittgenstein falling into a rage when Moore got something wrong. When he returned to Cambridge, Moore asked the university to consider accepting Logik as sufficient for a bachelor's degree, but they refused, saying it wasn't formatted properly: no footnotes, no preface. Wittgenstein was furious, writing to Moore in May 1914: [...] "If I am not worth your making an exception for me even in <b>some</b> <b>STUPID</b> details then I may as well go to Hell directly; and if I am worth it and you don't do it then—by God—you might go there." [...] Moore was apparently distraught; he wrote in his diary that he felt sick and could not get the letter out of his head. The two did not speak again until 1929.|$|E

2500|$|Though {{the fight}} was {{initially}} kept under wraps, both Russell and Clooney eventually gave official statements saying that the argument had blown over and neither harbored any ill will towards the other. However, Clooney continued to describe the event in later interviews, {{as well as the}} cover story of the October 2003 issue of Vanity Fair, in which he states: [...] "I would not stand for him humiliating and yelling and screaming at crew members, who weren't allowed to defend themselves. I don't believe in it and it makes me crazy. So my job was then to humiliate the people who were doing the humiliating." [...] Executive producer and production manager Gregory Goodman later stated about Clooney's comments in the media, [...] "It doesn't reflect well on [...] It's like <b>some</b> <b>stupid</b> sandbox quarrel." [...] In early 2012, Clooney indicated that he and Russell had mended their relationship, saying [...] "We made a really, really great film, and we had a really rough time together, but it's a case of both of us getting older.
