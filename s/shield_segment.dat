Publications concerning the transmission properties of these 4. 5 -mm thick stainless steel (AISI number 303 / 304) <b>shielding</b> <b>segments</b> are scarce and not compatible for implementation in treatment planning. Therefore the effect of shielding on dose distribution is unknown. The effective transmission factor has been measured and implemented in the planning computations. Screening efficacy was evaluated on 20 actual treatment plans, analyzing dose reduction to critical tissue and comparing dose distribution in planes relevant for this particular application. Due to high transmission (effective transmission factor = 0. 85), stainless steel screening segments only provide low, local dose reductions of maximum 15 %. A new approach with regard to optimization and source configuration is needed to reduce dose to vulnerable tissue, exploiting the screening segments to a maximum extent.

In the classical embodiment of an electrodynamic tether, the ambient magnetic field exerts a Lorentz {{force on the}} current along the tether, the ambient plasma providing circuit closure for the current. A suggested propulsion scheme would hypothetically eliminate tether performance dependence on the plasma density by using a full wire loop to close the current circuit, and a superconductor to <b>shield</b> a loop <b>segment</b> from the external uniform magnetic field and cancel the Lorentz force on that segment. Here, we use basic electromagnetic laws to explain how such a scheme cannot produce a net force. Because there is no net current in the superconducting shield, the circulation of the magnetic field along a closed line outside the full cross section, in its plane, is just due to the current flowing in the loop segment. The presence of the superconducting shield simply moves the Lorentz force from the <b>shielded</b> loop <b>segment</b> to the <b>shield</b> itself and, as a result, the total magnetic force, acting on full loop plus shield, remains zero...|$|R

40|$|To {{develop and}} verify a multisegment {{technique}} for prostate irradiation {{that results in}} better sparing of the rectal wall compared to a conventional three-field technique, for patients with a concave-shaped planning target volume (PTV) overlapping the rectal wall. Five patients have been selected with various degrees of overlap between PTV and rectal wall. The planned dose to the ICRU reference point is 78 Gy. The new technique consists of five beams, each having an open segment covering the entire PTV and several smaller segments in which the rectum is <b>shielded.</b> <b>Segment</b> weights are computer-optimized using an algorithm based on simulated annealing. The score function to be minimized consists of dose-volume constraints for PTV, rectal wall, and femoral heads. The resulting dose distribution is verified for each patient by using point measurements and line scans made with an ionization chamber in a water tank and by using film in a cylindrical polystyrene phantom. The final number of segments in the five-field technique ranges from 7 to 9 after optimization. Compared to the standard three-field technique, the maximum dose to the rectal wall decreases by approximately 3 Gy for patients with a large overlap and 1 Gy for patients with no overlap, resulting in a reduction of the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) {{by a factor of}} 1. 3 and 1. 2, respectively. The mean dose to the PTV is the same for the two techniques, but the dose distribution is slightly less homogeneous with the five-field technique (Average standard deviation of five patients is 1. 1 Gy and 1. 7 Gy for the three-field and five-field technique, respectively). Ionization chamber measurements show that in the PTV, the calculated dose is in general within 1 % of the measured dose. Outside the PTV, systematic dose deviations of up to 3 % exist. Film measurements show that for the complete treatment, the position of the isodose lines in sagittal and coronal planes is calculated fairly accurately, the maximum distance between measured and calculated isodoses being 4 mm. We developed a relatively simple multisegment "step-and-shoot" technique that can be delivered within an acceptable time frame at the treatment machine (Extra time needed is approximately 3 minutes).

40|$|Resolving {{molecular}} {{determinants of}} mechanical stability of proteins {{is crucial in}} the rational design of advanced biomaterials for use in biomedical and nanotechnological applications. Here we present an interdisciplinary study combining bioinformatics screening, steered molecular dynamics simulations, protein engineering, and single-molecule force spectroscopy that explores the mechanical properties of a macro domain protein with mixed α + β topology. The unique architecture is defined by a single seven-stranded β-sheet {{in the core of}} the protein flanked by five α-helices. Unlike mechanically stable proteins studied thus far, the macro domain provides the distinct advantage of having the key load-bearing hydrogen bonds (H bonds) buried in the hydrophobic core protected from water attacks. This feature allows direct measurement of the force required to break apart the load-bearing H bonds under locally hydrophobic conditions. Steered molecular dynamics simulations predicted extremely high mechanical stability of the macro domain by using constant velocity and constant force methods. Single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments confirm the exceptional mechanical strength of the macro domain, measuring a rupture force as high as 570  pN. Furthermore, through selective deletion of <b>shielding</b> peptide <b>segments,</b> we examined the same key H bonds under hydrophilic environments in which the β-strands are exposed to solvent and verify that the high mechanical stability of the macro domain results from excellent shielding of the load-bearing H bonds from competing water.

The shielding of an axisymmetric induction heating device is studied {{as a function}} of frequency, number of perforations and dimensions of the perforations. From the numerical point of view, the perforations cause the numerical model to be 3 D. A numerical optimisation is carried out to find the optimal geometry with respect to the shielding factor and the volume of the shield. For the optimisation, two approaches are presented. The first approach is fast and easy-to-implement, but has limited accuracy. It uses a classical 2 D axisymmetric model where the perforations are approximated by ‘axisymmetric air gaps’ resulting in a <b>segmented</b> <b>shield.</b> It is shown how to modify the 2 D model to obtain results that are similar to the ones of a 3 D model.

The cryopump is toroidally continuous to minimize inductive voltages and avoid electrical breakdown during disruptions. The cryopump consists of a 25 mm Inconel tube cooled by liquid helium and is surrounded by nitrogen cooled <b>shields.</b> A <b>segmented</b> ambient temperature radiation/particle shield protects the nitrogen shields. The pump is subjected to a steady state heat load of less than 10 W due to conduction and radiation heat transfer. The helium tube will be subjected to Joule heating of less than 300 J due to induced current and a particle load of less than 12 W during plasma operation. The thermal design of the cryopump requires that it be cooled by 5 g/s liquid helium at an inlet pressure of 115 kPa and a temperature of 4. 35 K. Thermal analysis and tests show that the helium tube can absorb a transient heat load of up to 100 W for 10 s and still pump deuterium at 6. 3 K. Disruptions induce toroidal currents in the helium line and nitrogen shields. These currents cross the rapidly changing magnetic fields, applying complex dynamic loads on the cryopump. The forces on the pump are extrapolated from magnetic measurements from DIII-D plasma disruptions and scaled to a 3 MA disruption. The supports for the nitrogen shield consist of a racetrack design, which are stiff for reacting the disruption loads, but are radially flexible to allow differential thermal displacements with the vacuum vessel.

This is the major rationale for the use of polymers which are highly crystalline and stiff namely expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) and Dacron in particular, as arterial bypass grafts. While this is immaterial in high-flow states, it becomes critically important at lower flows with a greater need for more compliant vessels. Polyurethanes being one of the most compliant polymers known are as such, the natural choice to build such constructs. However, concerns regarding their resistance to degradation have limited their use as vascular prostheses and in order to augment their strength, herein a novel polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane integrated poly(carbonate-urea) urethane (POSS-PCU) nanocomposite was synthesised by our group.

40|$|Electrostatic probes {{are widely}} used to measure spatial plasma {{parameters}} of the quasi-neutral plasma in Hall thrusters and similar ExB electric discharge devices. Significant perturbations of the plasma, induced by such probes, can mask the actual physics involved in operation of these devices. In Hall thrusters, probe-induced perturbations can produce changes in the discharge current and plasma parameters {{on the order of}} their steady state values. These perturbations are explored by varying the material, penetration distance, and residence time of various probe designs. A possible cause of these perturbations appears to be the secondary electron emission, induced by energetic plasma electrons, from insulator ceramic tubes in which the probe wire is inserted. A new probe in which a low secondary electron emission material, such as metal, shields the probe ceramic tube, is shown to function without producing such large perturbations. A segmentation of this shield further prevents probe -induced perturbations, by not shortening the plasma through the conductive shield. In a set of experiments with a <b>segmented</b> <b>shield</b> probe, the thruster was operated in the input power range of 500 - 2. 5 kW and discharge voltages of 200 - 500 V, while the probe-induced perturbations of the discharge current were below 4 % of its steady state value in the region in which 90 % of the voltage drop takes place...|$|R

Moderate illumination of the eye causes the melanin granules to move from a region within a PE cell body into numerous fingerlike extensions of the cell which interdigitate with the receptor outer segments. This migration takes many minutes and is reversed when the light falling on the eye decreases in intensity. Several reviews are concerned with the early descriptions of this phenomenon (6, 30) and with more recent experiments (1, 5, 19). The mechanism of the pigment granule motion is undetermined although there are studies concerning PE ultrastructure (8, 23, 31), scanning electron microscopy of the fingerlike extensions of the PE cells (27), the role of the PE in photoreceptor phagocytosis (32), the nature of the pigment granules (19), and the action spectrum of the light which induces the migration (16). This study reports the presence of a system of microfilaments associated with the pigment granules in the fingerlike processes of the PE cells.

U–Pb (zircon) dating has yielded an age of 2080 Ma for the intrusion. Two characteristic magnetic components, A and B, were isolated by thermal and alternating-field demagnetization. Component A was obtained from granites and quartz syenites (11 samples) and has a mean direction of D= 229 °, I= 28 °, and a pole position at 12 °N, 172 °E. This pole is close to a contemporary mean pole (9 °N, 187 °E) for the Ukrainian Shield, which implies that the Voronezh Massif and the Shield constituted a single entity at 2. 06 Ga. These poles diVer from contemporaneous poles of the Fennoscandian Shield, indicating that the relative positions of the two shields were diVerent from their present configuration about 2100 Myr ago.

AP- 3. 12 Q, ''Design Calculations and Analyses'' (Ref. 1) is used to perform the calculation and develop the document. The DS is classified as Quality Level 1 (Ref. 5, p. 7). Therefore, this calculation is subject to the Quality Assurance Requirements and Description (Ref. 4). The information provided by Attachment I is that of the potential design of the type of DS considered in this calculation, and provides the potential dimensions and materials for the DS design. Designs of the 21 -PWR (Pressurized Water Reactor) waste package (WP) and emplacement pallet (pallet, for brevity, throughout the document) used in this calculation are those defined in References 24 and 22, respectively. All obtained results are valid for these designs only...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction We {{describe}} the tagmatization {{pattern of the}} anterior region of the extant stomatopod Erugosquilla massavensis. For documentation we used the autofluorescence capacities of the specimens, resulting in a significant contrast between sclerotized and membranous areas. Results The anterior body region of E. massavensis can be grouped into three tagmata. Tagma I, the sensorial unit, comprises the segments of the eyes, antennules and antennae. This unit is set-off anteriorly from the posterior head region. Ventrally this unit surrounds a large medial sclerite, interpreted as the anterior part of the hypostome. Dorsally the antennular and antennal segments each bear a well-developed tergite. The dorsal shield is part of tagma II, most of the ventral part of which is occupied in the midline by the large, partly sclerotized posterior part of a complex combining hypostome and labrum. Tagma II includes three more segments behind the labrum, the mandibular, maxillulary and maxillary segments. Tagma III includes the maxillipedal segments, bearing five pairs of sub-chelate appendages. The dorsal sclerite {{of the first of}} these tagma-III segments, the segment of the first maxillipeds, is not included in the <b>shield,</b> so this <b>segment</b> is not part of tagma II as generally thought. The second and third segments of tagma III form a unit dorsally and ventrally. The tergites of the segments of tagma III become progressively larger from the anterior to the posterior, possibly resulting from a paedomorphic effect during evolution, which caused this reversed enlargement. Conclusions The described pattern of tagmosis differs from current textbook knowledge. Therefore, our re-description of the anterior body area of stomatopods is of considerable impact for understanding the head evolution of Stomatopoda. Likewise, it has a bearing upon any comparisons with fossil stomatopods, as mainly sclerotized areas are fossilized, and, on a wider scale, upon larger-scale comparisons with other malacostracans and eucrustaceans in general. </p...|$|R
40|$|The US 3 gene {{of human}} {{cytomegalovirus}} (HCMV) is expressed at immediate-early (IE) times in permissive HF cells, {{but not in}} nonpermissive rodent cells, and encodes several proteins that {{have been reported to}} have regulatory characteristics, although they are dispensable for growth in cell culture. Both spliced and unspliced forms of US 3 IE transcripts are associated with the second of only two known large and complex upstream enhancer domains within the 229 -kb HCMV genome, which we refer to as the IES cis-acting control region. Only the 260 -bp proximal segment (from - 313 to - 55) of the 600 -bp IES control domain, which contains multicopy NF-kappaB binding sites, proved to be necessary to transfer both high basal expression plus phorbol ester- and okadaic acid-inducible characteristics to heterologous promoters in transient assays in U- 937 and K- 562 cells. However, the IES control region contains a distinctive 280 -bp distal domain, characterized by the presence of seven interspersed repeats of a 10 -bp TGTCGCGACA palindromic consensus motif that encompasses a NruI site. This far upstream Nru repeat region (from - 596 to - 314) imparted up to 20 -fold down-regulation effects onto strong basal heterologous promoters as well as onto the IES enhancer plus minimal promoter region in both U- 937 and K- 562 cells. Functional Nru repressor elements (NREs) could not be generated by multimerizing either the palindromic (P) Nru motifs alone or adjacent degenerate interrupted (I Nru motifs alone. However, multimerized forms of the combined P plus I elements reconstituted the full 20 -fold cis-acting down-regulation phenotype of the intact NRE domain. The P and I forms of the Nru elements each bound independently and specifically to related cellular DNA-binding factors to form differently migrating A or B complexes, respectively, whereas the combined P plus I elements bound cooperatively to both the A and B complexes with high affinity. Interestingly, nuclear extracts from U- 937, K- 562, HeLa, and Vero cells all formed both the A and B NRE binding factor complexes, whereas those from HF cells produced only A complexes, and Raji, HL 60, and BALB/c 3 T 3 cells lacked both types of binding factor complexes. The core pentameric CGACA and CGATA half sites present in both the P and I Nru motifs are related to recently described Drosophila chromosomal insulator binding sites. Therefore, in addition to its cis-repression or silencer characteristics, the NRE domain appears likely to act to <b>shield</b> adjacent <b>segments</b> of the viral genome from the chromatin-reorganizing effects of the IES-inducible enhancer. We speculate that differential expression and regulation of the IES enhancer-controlled US 3 protein, either in concert with or separately from the major IE (MIE) enhancer-controlled IE 1 and IE 2 transactivator proteins, may {{play a critical role in}} determining HCMV permissiveness in some cell types and perhaps also in the establishment of or reactivation from latency...|$|R
