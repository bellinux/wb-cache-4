The review found that oral antioxidants given to [...] men in couples with male factor or unexplained <b>subfertility</b> may improve live birth rates, but more evidence is needed.|$|E
2500|$|Traditionally, {{the herd}} has been {{regarded}} as having a [...] "king bull" [...] system whereby one bull sires all calves {{during the period of}} his [...] "reign" [...] which lasts maybe 2–3 years until he is deposed, usually violently, by a challenger. While this may well have been the case when herd numbers were low, it is less likely to have been in effect when the herd has been numerous. Such a system has been claimed to have retarded inbreeding by preventing a bull from mating with his daughters but such an effect would have been very slight over the 67 generations which is the minimum duration over which inbreeding is likely to have taken place. There is some evidence of testicular hypoplasia which might suggest male <b>subfertility.</b>|$|E
2500|$|... "Demographers tend {{to define}} {{infertility}} as childlessness {{in a population}} of women of reproductive age," [...] whereas [...] "the epidemiological definition refers to [...] "trying for" [...] or [...] "time to" [...] a pregnancy, generally in a population of women exposed to" [...] a probability of conception. Currently, female fertility normally peaks at age 24 and diminishes after 30, with pregnancy occurring rarely after age 50. A female is most fertile within 24 hours of ovulation. [...] Male fertility peaks usually at age 25 and declines after age 40. [...] The time needed to pass (during which the couple tries to conceive) for that couple to be diagnosed with infertility differs between different jurisdictions. Existing definitions of infertility lack uniformity, rendering comparisons in prevalence between countries or over time problematic. Therefore, data estimating the prevalence of infertility cited by various sources differs significantly. A couple that tries unsuccessfully {{to have a child}} after {{a certain period of time}} (often a short period, but definitions vary) is sometimes said to be subfertile, meaning less fertile than a typical couple. Both infertility and <b>subfertility</b> are defined as the inability to conceive after a certain period of time (the length of which vary), so often the two terms overlap.|$|E
50|$|Most {{of these}} {{conditions}} are associated with <b>subfertility</b> and/or infertility. Therefore, high FSH levels are an indication of <b>subfertility</b> and/or infertility.|$|E

5000|$|The uterus, vagina, and oviducts are normal. The ovary {{is normal}} prior to puberty, {{and there is}} still no gross {{aberrant}} phenotype during adulthood. However, there is partial anovulation and <b>subfertility,</b> which is due to ovarian defects, namely compromised follicular maturation via loss of estradiol signaling in ovarian granulosa cells.|$|E
5000|$|Folate is {{necessary}} for fertility in both men and women. It contributes to spermatogenesis. Therefore, it {{is necessary}} to receive sufficient amounts through the diet to avoid <b>subfertility.</b> [...] Also, polymorphisms in genes of enzymes involved in folate metabolism could be one reason for fertility complications in some women with unexplained infertility.|$|E
5000|$|Without {{technological}} intervention, a non-motile or abnormally-motile sperm is {{not going}} to fertilize. Therefore, the fraction of a sperm population that is motile is widely used as a measure of semen quality [...] Insufficient sperm motility is a common cause of <b>subfertility</b> or infertility. Several measures are available to improve sperm quality.|$|E
50|$|The {{presence}} of anti-thyroid antibodies {{is associated with}} an increased risk of unexplained <b>subfertility</b> (odds ratio 1.5 and 95% confidence interval 1.1-2.0), miscarriage (odds ratio 3.73, 95% confidence interval 1.8-7.6), recurrent miscarriage (odds ratio 2.3, 95% confidence interval 1.5-3.5), preterm birth (odds ratio 1.9, 95% confidence interval 1.1-3.5) and maternal Postpartum thyroiditis (odds ratio 11.5, 95% confidence interval 5.6-24).|$|E
50|$|There {{is no cure}} or {{treatment}} for testicular microlithiasis, however, patients may be monitored via ultrasound {{to make sure that}} other conditions do not develop. Emphasis on testicular examination is the recommended follow up for asymptomatic men incidentally identified with testicular microlithiasis. For men with risk factors for testicular germ cell tumor such as <b>subfertility</b> however, individualized discussion with their urologists is necessary.|$|E

50|$|Vitamin E helps counter {{oxidative}} stress, {{which is}} associated with sperm DNA damage and reduced sperm motility. A hormone-antioxidant combination may improve sperm count and motility. However there is only some low quality evidence from few small studies that oral antioxidants given to males in couples undergoing in vitro fertilisation for male factor or unexplained <b>subfertility</b> result in higher live birth rate. It in unclear {{if there are any}} adverse effects.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} genes wherein {{mutation}} causes female infertility, {{as shown in}} table below. Also, there are additional conditions involving female infertility which {{are believed to be}} genetic but where no single gene {{has been found to be}} responsible, notably Mayer-Rokitansky-Küstner-Hauser Syndrome (MRKH). Finally, an unknown number of genetic mutations cause a state of <b>subfertility,</b> which in addition to other factors such as environmental ones may manifest as frank infertility.|$|E

50|$|Historically Lipiodol {{was often}} used as a {{contrast}} medium at hysterosalpingography (HSG: a procedure to determine tubal patency, used {{in the investigation of}} <b>subfertility).</b> It became less commonly utilised in the 1960s to 1980s because the more modern water-soluble media give images that are easier to interpret. There is also an important safety issue with Lipiodol in that intravasation (leakage) of the fluid into the venous system has caused complications in the past.|$|E
50|$|<b>Subfertility</b> is {{associated}} with preterm birth. Couples who have tried more than 1 year versus those who have tried less than 1 year before achieving a spontaneous conception have an adjusted odds ratio of 1.35 (95% confidence interval 1.22-1.50) of preterm birth. Pregnancies after IVF confers {{a greater risk of}} preterm birth than spontaneous conceptions after more than 1 year of trying, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.55 (95% CI 1.30-1.85).|$|E
50|$|A survey {{study has}} {{indicated}} that the LEEP procedure {{does not appear to}} affect fertility. On the other hand, a case-control study has found an association between surgical treatment of CIN lesions and risk of infertility or <b>subfertility,</b> with an odds ratio of approximately 2. Scarring of the cervix is a theoretical mechanism of causing trouble conceiving. This scar tissue can be massaged or broken up in a number of ways, thus allowing the cervical opening to dilate back to normal size.|$|E
50|$|Increasing {{body weight}} is also {{thought to be}} linked to the {{development}} of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). There are specific aspects associated with PCOS allowing an indication of diagnosis of the syndrome including hyperandrogenism (hirsutism), irregular periods, anovulation and <b>subfertility.</b> Obesity in PCOS sufferers amplifies hormonal and metabolic decline, therefore damaging fertility and oocyte quality in women. PCOS can also have an effect if conception is successful through assisted reproductive technology (ART) in obese patients, leading to an increase in miscarriage rates.|$|E
5000|$|WNT4 is {{involved}} in a couple features of pregnancy as a downstream target of BMP2. For example, it regulates endometrial stromal cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. [...] These processes are all necessary for the development of an embryo. Ablation in female mice results in <b>subfertility,</b> with defects in implantation and decidualization. For instance, there is a decrease in responsiveness to progesterone signaling. Furthermore, postnatal uterine differentiation is characterized by a reduction in gland numbers and the stratification of the luminal epithelium.|$|E
50|$|This gene encodes {{a member}} of the dynein heavy chain family. It is a microtubule-dependent motor ATPase and has been {{reported}} {{to be involved in the}} movement of respiratory cilia. Mutations in this gene have been implicated in causing primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD, formerly called 'immotile cilia syndrome') and Kartagener syndrome (PCD with situs inversus totalis). Males with PCD are not sterile, but are infertile due to lack of sperm motility. There are reports of <b>subfertility</b> and increased risk of ectopic pregnancy in women with PCD.|$|E
5000|$|For {{processes}} such as cellular or pronuclear injection {{the target}} cell is positioned under the microscope and two micromanipulators—one holding the pipette and one holding a microcapillary needle usually between 0.5 and 5 µm in diameter (larger if injecting stem cells into an embryo)—are used to penetrate the cell membrane and/or the nuclear envelope. [...] In this way the process {{can be used to}} introduce a vector into a single cell. Microinjection can also be used in the cloning of organisms, in the study of cell biology and viruses, and for treating male <b>subfertility</b> through intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI, [...] ).|$|E
50|$|The {{association}} {{was founded in}} 1936 as the Hong Kong Eugenics League (香港優生學會). In 1950, it changed its name officially to the Family Planning Association of Hong Kong. It {{became one of the}} founding members of the International Planned Parenthood Federation in 1952. At the beginning, FPAHK used individual contacts to do its task, spreading the Family Planning message. Subsequently, it started a clinic service. In 1956, it set up the first <b>subfertility</b> clinic. In 1955, the Hong Kong government began subsidising FPAHKs activities. From 1964 on, FPAHK received financial support by the International Planned Parenthood Federation. In 1967, FPAHK ran the first Hong Kong Family Planning Knowledge, Attitude & Practice (KAP) Survey (「香港家庭計劃知識、態度及實行調查」) and started sex education.|$|E
50|$|Testicular microlithiasis is {{an unusual}} {{condition}} diagnosed on testicular ultrasound. It is found in between 1.5 to 5% of normal males, and {{may be found in}} up to 20% of individuals with <b>subfertility.</b> It is an asymptomatic, non-progressive disease. The cause is unknown, but this condition has been associated with testicular cancer in a small group of individuals, cryptorchidism, mumps, infertility and intraepithelial germ cell neoplasia. Classic testicular microlithiasis is defined as five or more echogenic foci per view in either or both testes, and limited testicular microlithiasis defined as one or more echogenic foci that do not satisfy the criteria for classic testicular microlithiasis. In 80% of cases, both testicles are affected.|$|E
