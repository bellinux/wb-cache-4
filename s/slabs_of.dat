5|$|Bacon did {{not return}} to the crucifixion theme until his 1962 Three Studies for a Crucifixion. That {{depiction}} is a far more oblique and less literal utilisation of the iconography of the biblical scene, but a more direct invocation of imagery of the slaughterhouse and <b>slabs</b> <b>of</b> meat.|$|E
5|$|Stream downcutting {{continued}} {{along with}} canyon-forming {{processes such as}} mass wasting; sediment-rich and abrasive flood stage waters would undermine cliffs until vertical <b>slabs</b> <b>of</b> rock sheared away. This process continues to be especially efficient with the vertically jointed Navajo Sandstone.|$|E
5|$|The {{new process}} {{referred}} to in the announcement was the use of dry <b>slabs</b> <b>of</b> transparent gelatin, used as an adhesive layer for the fixation of the silver salts over the paper.|$|E
50|$|DNG {{can provide}} phase {{compensation}} {{due to their}} negative index of refraction. This is accomplished by combining a <b>slab</b> <b>of</b> conventional lossless DPS material with a <b>slab</b> <b>of</b> lossless DNG metamaterial.|$|R
50|$|Joining a <b>slab</b> <b>of</b> ENG {{material}} and <b>slab</b> <b>of</b> MNG material resulted in properties such as resonances, anomalous tunneling, transparency and zero reflection.

5|$|Coalhouse Fort is {{exceptionally}} well-preserved; {{it provides}} {{one of the}} finest surviving examples of a mid-Victorian armoured casemate fort. It has twelve casemates arranged in a semi-circle facing south and east towards the river, with an annexed open battery facing south-west. The casemates are faced with massive <b>slabs</b> <b>of</b> granite and have iron gun ports to protect the gunners from splinters dislodged by incoming fire.|$|E
5|$|The vestibule's {{interior}} decoration is also described by Procopius: {{the walls were}} decorated with <b>slabs</b> <b>of</b> multi-colored marble, while the ceilings were covered with mosaics, which depicted Justinian and his empress Theodora flanked by the Senate, {{as well as the}} victories of Belisarius in the Vandalic and Gothic wars and his triumphal return bearing spoils, defeated kings and kingdoms to his emperor.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of stelae {{have been}} {{recorded}} in the Maya region, displaying a wide stylistic variation. Many are upright <b>slabs</b> <b>of</b> limestone sculpted on one or more faces, with available surfaces sculpted with figures carved in relief and with hieroglyphic text. Stelae in a few sites display a much more three-dimensional appearance where locally available stone permits, such as at Copán and Toniná. Plain stelae {{do not appear to}} have been painted nor overlaid with stucco decoration, but most Maya stelae were probably brightly painted in red, yellow, black, blue and other colours.|$|E

5|$|In Philadelphia itself, the {{combination}} of snow and sleet closed many of the schools, delayed flights, trains and buses. The school district parochial schools were closed on the 14th, as were the regional and central administrative offices. During the midday hours on the 14th, giant <b>slabs</b> <b>of</b> ice slid off tops of buildings in Center City and crashed to the ground. Chunks of ice as large as three feet wide {{made their way to}} the pavement from high up. Police started to block off areas where the ice was falling, however one man was hit in the head by the falling ice and was knocked to the ground.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} {{that there was a}} facade in front of the chamber, as is evident at other chambered tombs in Britain, such as West Kennet Long Barrow and Wayland's Smithy. It is also possible that there was a portal stone atop the chamber, as was apparent at Kit's Coty House and Lower Kit's Coty House. Many of the larger <b>slabs</b> <b>of</b> stone that have fallen down the slope on the eastern end of the monument may have been parts of this facade or portal.|$|E
5|$|Silver birch wood is pale in colour with no {{distinct}} heartwood {{and is used}} {{in making}} furniture, plywood, veneers, parquet blocks, skis, kitchen utensils and in turnery. It makes a good firewood that produces a good heat when burnt but is quickly consumed by the flames. <b>Slabs</b> <b>of</b> bark are used for making roof shingles and wooden footwear. Historically, the bark was used for tanning. Bark can be heated and the resin collected; the resin is an excellent waterproof glue and useful for starting fires. The thin sheets of bark that peel off young wood contain a waxy resin and are easy to ignite even when wet. The dead twigs are also useful as kindling for outdoor fires.|$|E

5|$|The pyramid {{does not}} have {{internal}} chambers, the chambers being located underground. These were constructed in a deep open ditch dug before the pyramid construction started and only later covered by the pyramid. The entrance to the underground chambers is located north of the pyramid from a pavement in the court {{in front of the}} pyramid face. This is different from the 4th dynasty pyramids for which the entrance to the internal chambers is located on the pyramid side itself. The entrance was hewn into the bedrock and floored and roofed with large <b>slabs</b> <b>of</b> white limestone, most of which have been removed in modern times.|$|E
5|$|Structure E4 is a {{platform}} located behind Pyramid E1 and encloses {{the eastern side}} of the Group E plaza. It faces west onto the plaza and has two access stairways, both flanked by ramps built from small <b>slabs</b> <b>of</b> stone and with cornices at the top. The platform walls are of fine workmanship, being built with well-cut and carefully fitted pumice. The front portion of the upper platform was paved with stone slabs, and a bench ran the entire length of the back of the platform. The clay floor between the paving and the bench was found to have been burnt. An offering was excavated from the central axis of the platform's base, it consisted of two ring-shaped clubs placed on either side of a stone ball.|$|E
5|$|The Olmec colossal {{heads are}} at least {{seventeen}} monumental stone representations of human heads sculpted from large basalt boulders. The heads date from at least before 900 BC and are a distinctive feature of the Olmec civilization of ancient Mesoamerica. All portray mature individuals with fleshy cheeks, flat noses, and slightly crossed eyes; their physical characteristics correspond to a type that is still common among the inhabitants of Tabasco and Veracruz. The backs of the monuments often are flat. The boulders were brought from the Sierra de los Tuxtlas mountains of Veracruz. Given that the extremely large <b>slabs</b> <b>of</b> stone used in their production were transported over large distances, requiring {{a great deal of}} human effort and resources, it is thought that the monuments represent portraits of powerful individual Olmec rulers. Each of the known examples has a distinctive headdress. The heads were variously arranged in lines or groups at major Olmec centres, but the method and logistics used to transport the stone to these sites remain unclear.|$|E

5|$|The {{seasonal}} frosting {{of areas}} near the southern ice cap {{results in the}} formation of transparent 1-metre-thick <b>slabs</b> <b>of</b> dry ice above the ground. With the arrival of spring, sunlight warms the subsurface and pressure from subliming CO2 builds up under a slab, elevating and ultimately rupturing it. This leads to geyser-like eruptions of CO2 gas mixed with dark basaltic sand or dust. This process is rapid, observed happening {{in the space of a}} few days, weeks or months, a rate of change rather unusual in geology – especially for Mars. The gas rushing underneath a slab to the site of a geyser carves a spiderweb-like pattern of radial channels under the ice, the process being the inverted equivalent of an erosion network formed by water draining through a single plughole.|$|E
5|$|Diamond is hard, {{chemically}} inert, and {{has high}} thermal conductivity {{and a low}} coefficient of thermal expansion. These properties make diamond superior to any other existing window material used for transmitting infrared and microwave radiation. Therefore, synthetic diamond is starting to replace zinc selenide as the output window of high-power CO2 lasers and gyrotrons. Those synthetic polycrystalline diamond windows are shaped as disks of large diameters (about 10cm for gyrotrons) and small thicknesses (to reduce absorption) and can only be produced with the CVD technique. Single crystal <b>slabs</b> <b>of</b> dimensions of length up to approximately 10mm are becoming increasingly important in several areas of optics including heatspreaders inside laser cavities, diffractive optics and as the optical gain medium in Raman lasers. Recent advances in the HPHT and CVD synthesis techniques have improved the purity and crystallographic structure perfection of single-crystalline diamond enough to replace silicon as a diffraction grating and window material in high-power radiation sources, such as synchrotrons. Both the CVD and HPHT processes are also used to create designer optically transparent diamond anvils {{as a tool for}} measuring electric and magnetic properties of materials at ultra high pressures using a diamond anvil cell.|$|E
5|$|Mesolithic humans {{arrived in}} the Firth of the Clyde during the fourth {{millennium}} BC, probably from Ireland. This {{was followed by a}} wave of Neolithic peoples using the same route and {{there is some evidence that}} the Firth of Clyde was a significant route via which mainland Scotland was colonised at this time. A particular style of megalithic structure developed in Argyll, the Clyde estuary and elsewhere in western Scotland that has become known as the Clyde cairn. They are rectangular or trapezoidal in shape with a small enclosing chamber faced with large <b>slabs</b> <b>of</b> stone set on end and sometimes subdivided into smaller compartments. A forecourt area may have been used for displays or rituals associated with the interment of the dead, who were placed inside the chambers. They are concentrated in Arran, Bute and Kintyre and it is likely that the Clyde cairns were the earliest forms of Neolithic monument constructed by incoming settlers although few of the 100 or so examples have been given a radiocarbon dating. An example at Monamore on Arran has been dated to 3160 BC, although it was almost certainly built earlier than that, possibly c. 4000BC. There are also numerous standing stones dating from prehistoric times, including six stone circles on Machrie Moor, Arran and other examples on Great Cumbrae and Bute.|$|E

5|$|The lithosphere, which rides {{atop the}} asthenosphere, {{is divided into}} a number of tectonic plates that are {{continuously}} being created and consumed at their opposite plate boundaries. Oceanic crust and tectonic plates are formed and move apart at mid-ocean ridges. Abyssal hills are formed by stretching of the oceanic lithosphere. Consumption or destruction of the oceanic lithosphere occurs at oceanic trenches (a type of convergent boundary, also known as a destructive plate boundary) by a process known as subduction. Oceanic trenches are found at places where the oceanic lithospheric <b>slabs</b> <b>of</b> two different plates meet, and the denser (older) slab begins to descend back into the mantle. At the consumption edge of the plate (the oceanic trench), the oceanic lithosphere has thermally contracted to become quite dense, and it sinks under its own weight in the process of subduction. The subduction process consumes older oceanic lithosphere, so oceanic crust is seldom more than 200 million years old. The overall process of repeated cycles of creation and destruction of oceanic crust is known as the Supercontinent cycle, first proposed by Canadian geophysicist and geologist John Tuzo Wilson.|$|E
