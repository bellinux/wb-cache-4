50|$|Shaft collars saw few {{improvements}} until 1910 through 1911, when William G. Allen and Howard T.

His <b>safety</b> <b>set</b> collar was soon copied by others and became an industry standard.

50|$|As {{standard}} the Mauser M 98 rifle {{features the}} traditional Mauser 98 three-position safety attached {{at the rear}} of the bolt which operating lever can be flicked from right (safety on, bolt locked) to middle (safety on, bolt can be opened for reloading), to left (ready to fire) but only when the rifle is cocked, otherwise the safety will not move. The safety secures the firing pin. The safety can only be released by firing the rifle with the <b>safety</b> <b>set</b> in the ready to fire position or by closing the cocked bolt with a previously pulled trigger that must be kept pulled back during the closing operation. Disengaging the safety by closing the bolt is only possible with the <b>safety</b> <b>set</b> in the ready to fire position. The safety catch lever is quite large, making it easy to operate but posing a problem for mounting telescopic sights very low above the receiver whilst retaining good operability of the safety catch leaver.The Mauser M 98 rifle series can also be ordered with an optional Mauser horizontal 3-position safety with locking lever to ensure good operability of the safety catch leaver with low mounted aiming optics.|$|E

The fuze may be activated also by action of a bar which Is fitted on the fuze after laying of the mine, with a force of 13-17 N (2-4 lbf). The fuze has an ejection charge of black powder which breaks the weakened part of the mine body, ejecting the top part with tuze, removing the clod and clearing {{the way to the}} penetrating disc to obtain a higher penetration.|$|E

50|$|On 25 November 1984, an East Rail Line Metro Cammell EMU train derailed between Sheung Shui and Lo Wu station. The {{incident}} {{occurred when the}} driver, preparing to back the train up to Sheung Shui station, failed to follow a speed/stop signal while the train was exceeding the speed limit. The train crashed into a boulder buffer with the first two cars piling {{on top of each}} other. The degree of damage was so extensive that the cars never returned to service. Passengers were unloaded prior to the crash while the driver sustained only minor injuries. However, the accident caused train services to be suspended {{for the rest of the}} day and the incident spurred a series of public outcries concerning railway <b>safety.</b> <b>Set</b> E45 (which was 233-234-235) was hence commissioned as a result of the accident to replace the damaged cars.|$|E
50|$|The HK79 is {{fitted with}} an internal, single-action firing {{mechanism}} {{that has a}} charging mechanism located {{at the rear of}} the frame (the mechanism is cocked manually after loading the weapon) and a trigger mechanism with a button-type trigger located on the left-hand side of the handguard. Safe operation is ensured by means of a cross-bolt manual safety catch (installed in the frame, forward of the cocking mechanism). The safety mechanism’s “safe” and “ready” positions are marked with red and white rings respectively; the weapon can be loaded and cocked with the <b>safety</b> <b>set</b> at either position. A quadrant sight is provided for aiming, fitted to the right side of the grenade launcher, providing a rotating frame with a post and notch sight, graduated for distances from 50 to 350 m, every 50 m. The launcher weighs 1.5 kg unloaded; the muzzle velocity using standard ammunition is approx. 76 m/s. The HK79A1 is a variant specially designed for installation on the HK33 assault rifle.|$|E

5000|$|In his autobiography, {{the founder}} of the Standard Pressed Steel Company (SPS; now SPS Technologies, Inc.), Howard T. Hallowell Sr, {{presents}} a version of events in which SPS developed a hex socket drive in-house, independently of Allen, circa 1911. From this came the [...] line of products. This account from Hallowell does not mention the Allen patent of 1910, nor the Allen <b>safety</b> <b>set</b> screw product line. Hallowell does describe, however, the same inspiration also mentioned in connection with Allen for a wave of adoption of the hex socket head, beginning with set screws and followed by cap screws. This was an industrial safety campaign, part of the larger Progressive Movement, to get headless set screws onto the pulleys and shafts of the line shafting that was ubiquitous in factories of the day. The headless set screws {{would be less likely to}} catch the clothing of workers and pull them into injurious contact with the running shaft.|$|E
50|$|A Public Health Inspector (also {{known as}} an Environmental Health Officer) investigates health hazards {{in a wide variety}} of settings, and will take action to {{mitigate}} or eliminate the hazards. Usually the public perception of a health inspector is someone who examines restaurants and ensures they maintain sanitary standards for food <b>safety</b> <b>set</b> by the regulating authority. However, public health inspectors have much broader job duties, including inspecting swimming pools, substandard housing conditions, public schools, day cares, nursing homes, and personal service establishments such as tattoo parlours. Depending on their jurisdiction, Registered Environmental Health Officers often permit and inspect wells, private water systems, and individual subsurface sewage disposal (septic) systems. Other tasks include: campground inspections, tanning salon inspections, beauty salon inspections, correctional facility inspections and mobile home park inspection. The public health inspector (environmental health officer) also plays a vital role in community projects such as those concerning health promotion, tobacco reduction, healthy built environments/healthy communities, food security, and emergency preparedness. They may also respond to complaints such as animal bites, garbage complaints, odor complaints, or sewage overflows. Due to their educational background they can provide information and referrals with regards to; lead, radon, mold, and emerging diseases such as West Nile Virus and Avian Flu. The field also overlaps with hazardous materials (Hazmat) and many Hazmat responders are also Licensed Environmental Health Practitioners or Registered Environmental Health Specialists.|$|E
