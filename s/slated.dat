50|$|The <b>slate</b> {{industry}} is the industry {{related to the}} extraction and processing of <b>slate.</b> <b>Slate</b> is either quarried from a <b>slate</b> quarry or reached by tunneling in a <b>slate</b> mine. Common uses for <b>slate</b> include as a roofing material, a flooring material, gravestones and memorial tablets, and for electrical insulation. <b>Slate</b> mines are found {{around the world and}} the major <b>slate</b> mining region in the United Kingdom is Wales: in Cornwall {{there are a number of}} <b>slate</b> quarries (famously the village of Delabole) and in the Lake District there are numerous <b>slate</b> mines and quarries.|$|R
50|$|<b>Slate.</b> A <b>slate</b> {{can be made}} up {{in three}} ways: all {{candidates}} submitting a <b>slate</b> before the primary or caucuses, the winning candidate submitting their <b>slate</b> after the primary or caucuses, or the State Committee or Convention making up the <b>slates</b> before the primary or caucuses. The allocated delegates are then selected from these <b>slates.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{primary means}} of failure in a <b>slate</b> roof is when {{individual}} <b>slates</b> lose their peg attachment and begin to slide out of place. This can open up small gaps above each <b>slate.</b> A secondary mode of failure is when the <b>slates</b> themselves begin to break up. The lower parts of a <b>slate</b> may break loose, giving a gap below a <b>slate.</b> Commonly the small and stressed area above the nail hole may fail, allowing the <b>slate</b> to slip as before. In the worst cases, a <b>slate</b> may simply break in half and be lost altogether. A common repair to <b>slate</b> roofs is to apply 'torching', a mortar fillet underneath the <b>slates,</b> attaching them to the battens.13 This may applied as either a repair, to hold slipping <b>slates,</b> or pre-emptively on construction.|$|R

5000|$|... {{published}} in the Budgerigar Bulletin, Mr Bowman described {{the establishment of the}} <b>Slate</b> mutation. After breeding a few <b>Slates</b> of the blue series, he deliberately paired a Cobalt split <b>Slate</b> cock to a Light Yellow hen to produce <b>Slates</b> of the green series, and in 1937 he succeeded in breeding both Light Green <b>Slates</b> and a Dark Green <b>Slate.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Dark {{mutation}} {{produces a}} more noticeable effect {{in combination with}} <b>Slate</b> than it does with Grey, but these darker <b>Slate</b> shades differ from one another very much less than Skyblue, Cobalt and Mauve differ. The Cobalt <b>Slate</b> and Mauve <b>Slate</b> are distinctly darker than the Skyblue <b>Slate,</b> with the Mauve <b>Slate</b> being very dark. When Violet is also introduced the resulting Violet Mauve <b>Slate</b> {{is said to be}} extremely dark, of a dense blue-black colour.|$|R

50|$|The Baltoro Formation {{consists}} of thin-bedded black, foliated shales often grading into black <b>slates.</b> The <b>slates</b> are highly cleaved and metamorphosed {{as high as}} lower greenschist facies.

The <b>slates</b> of the Baltoro Formation is part of a thick sequence of well-cleaved black shales and <b>slates</b> that are exposed along almost the entire length of the Karakoram.

50|$|<b>Slate</b> {{itself had}} been in use as a {{building}} material long before it was used for writing. The use of <b>slate</b> as a roofing material {{can be traced back}} to at least the Roman era in Wales, from the first to the fourth century AD. The <b>slate</b> used in roofing had to be of very high quality, as the material is prone to cracking and can break if not handled with great care. <b>Slate</b> used for writing <b>slates</b> also had to be of good quality because of the thinness required. Mining <b>slate</b> of this quality is a straightforward process since <b>slate</b> splits into nearly perfectly flat surfaces. The difficult part of the mining process is sorting out the quality <b>slate</b> from <b>slate</b> with “cats” or flaws. Properly sorted <b>slate</b> can be made into any required size. Roofing <b>slate</b> is still in use, primarily for the restoration of eighteenth and nineteenth century buildings, as it is fairly expensive.|$|R
50|$|In 1938 Mr Bowman paired a <b>Slate</b> to a Cinnamon, {{producing}} split Cinnamon <b>Slate</b> Type II cocks, and in 1939 {{he intended}} breeding from these to produce Cinnamon <b>Slates,</b> but no results {{appear to have}} been reported. It was, however, reported that Cinnamon <b>Slates</b> had been bred in 1939 by both W G Roderick of Purley and Len Trevallion of Loughton in Essex. Mr Roderick paired a Light Green split dilute cinnamon <b>slate</b> cock to a Cinnamon Cobalt split dilute hen and they produced a Cinnamon Dilute <b>Slate</b> in the first round. Mr Trevallion paired a Skyblue split cinnamon <b>slate</b> cock to a Dilute Mauve hen and they produced a Cinnamon <b>Slate</b> Cobalt split dilute hen. These <b>Slates</b> are likely to have been obtained from Mr Bowman, as he reported that several other breeders had <b>Slates.</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{conventional}} <b>slate</b> roof {{consists of}} thin <b>slates,</b> hung over wooden laths. <b>Slates</b> are hung {{in place by}} wooden pegs through a hole {{at the top of}} each <b>slate.</b> The peg stops the <b>slate</b> slipping downwards, the weight of the <b>slates</b> above it hold the <b>slate</b> down. Later roofs replaced the peg by an iron nail driven into the lath, but the nail is always primarily a hook and it is the weight of the <b>slates</b> above that hold the roof covering down onto the frame. Lead nails were also used, long enough to be bent over the laths from the inside. In time these developed into strips cut from lead sheet.|$|R
