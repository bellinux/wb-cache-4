40|$|Onsite, {{small-scale}} and decentralised {{wastewater treatment}} systems {{are widely used}} around the world (for example serving {{a quarter of the}} population in the United States), and are perhaps symbolised by the septic tank and associated soak well or leach drain as used for domestic wastewater treatment in rural areas. More recent innovations have taken advantage of our growing understanding of the fundamental physical, chemical and biological processes of wastewater treatment. Innovation has also been driven by a desire to recycle the water and nutrients to achieve environmental sustainability. Onsite, small scale and decentralised systems assist with achieving the recycling objective. IWAﾒs 6 th <b>Specialised</b> <b>Conference</b> on Small Water and Wastewater Systems and 1 st <b>Specialised</b> <b>Conference</b> on Onsite Wastewater Treatment and Recycling drew well over two hundred delegates to discuss these issues, and from over 150 platform and poster papers 40 have been selected for these proceedings following peer review...|$|E

40|$|More {{often than}} not, discussions {{taking place in}} <b>specialised</b> <b>conferences</b> dealing with {{computers}} and design tend to focus mostly on the tool itself. What the computer can do that other tools cannot, how computers might improve design and whether a new aesthetic would result from the computer, {{these are among the}} most recurrent issues addressed in those forums. But, by placing the instrument {{at the center of the}} debate, we might be distorting the nature of design.   In the course KEYWORDS, carried out in the years 1992 and 1993 at the ETH Zurich, the goal was to transcend the discourses that concentrate on the computer, integrating it in a wider theoretical framework including principles of modern art and architecture.

40|$|This thesis aims at {{contributing}} to the research on academic conference paper presentations, particularly to the discussion sessions that follow them. The main {{purpose of this study}} is to explore the speaker's expression of evaluation in the discussion session of two <b>specialised</b> <b>conference</b> paper presentations in Linguistics and Chemistry from a multimodal approach. I set out to investigate evaluation in spoken academic discourse beyond the traditional linguistic approach to foreground the role of kinesics and paralanguage that co-occur with the linguistic expression of evaluation. To meet the objective of the thesis, the theoretical framework was embedded in techniques of genre analysis (Bhatia 1993, Swales 1990) and discourse analysis, including the theoretical orientations of systemic functional linguistics (Halliday 1978, 1985 a), conversation analysis (Schegloff & Sack 1973), pragmatics (Brown & Levinson 1978, 1987), and multimodal discourse analysis (Kress & van Leeuwen 2001). This framework allowed me to identify the structure of the interaction, the rhetorical moves in which the interaction is organised, and finally the linguistic and multimodal expression of evaluation that articulates the rhetoric of the interaction...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{special issue}} of the journal of Cleaner Production focuses on "Energy for Sustainable Future". It is {{designed}} to mirror the increasing relevance of renewable energy sources and improved efficiency as crucial topics for practitioners in industry, for governmental policy makers, as well as for civic service providers, researchers, and educators. The purpose of this special issue is to serve as a catalyst for dialogue. The global warming related to CO 2 emissions, coupled with steeply rising energy prices and the recent global financial institutional melt-down are causing massive societal concerns and give rise to increasing demand for ways to improve societal and individual energy efficiency and for ways to shift increasingly to alternative, low or non-carbon based energy systems. Until recently, industrial energy efficiency improvements have focused on improvements on efficiency rather than on the integration of renewable sources. The aim of this special issue is the identification of policies to support {{the development and implementation of}} technologies and management approaches we can employ to make the transition to more sustainable societies. The collection of papers in this special issue provide a foundation for students, researchers, scholars, practitioners and policy makers interested in making sustainable development more than a metaphor. The papers include focus upon ways for:(a) Improving industrial process to achieve improvements in energy efficiency. (b) Minimising waste disposals and reducing their impact through better management. (c) Reducing CO 2 emissions by making progress toward lower carbon, renewable energy based systems,(d) Improving production of biofuels and hydrogen production systems, facilitated by employing cleaner production and novel LCA tools. (e) Improving integration of advanced materials and energy efficient equipment in different industrial sectors. Current and future developments in national and world economies are closely connected to sustainable, efficient and safe usage of raw materials and upon energy based on cleaner production concepts and approaches that are ecologically and economically appropriate for the short and for the long-term future of society. These challenges have received considerable attention in the media and scientific journals over the last several years. The idea of developing a <b>specialised</b> <b>conference</b> focussed upon them was put forward on various occasions. Focus upon them became reality on the 5 th and 6 th May 2008 in the historic Castle of Veszprem, Hungary, the current premises of the Hungarian Academy of Science which hosted the Workshop. The Workshop was a stimulating event and an overwhelming success, with nearly 100 contributors from Africa, North America, Asia and Europe, representing 28 countries. After a comprehensive selection and thorough reviewing procedure 11 papers were selected for this special issue. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{title of}} the Bachelor´s thesis is "The nurse and her work in the prison service of the Czech Republic. The nurse´s work always starts from the patient´s needs and shall provide the patient with the feeling of surety. The nurse´s work is focused {{not only on the}} nursing care but also on the support of the health and healthy living standard. It is a set of {{measures}} and particular activities which the nurse carries out, is qualified to carry them out and is responsible for them. The nursing care depends entirely upon the patient's condition and the surroundings where the patient is found. It is beneficial for the nurse working in the prison service to have experience in more nursing specialisations as her work is large-scale and the nursing care is not just focused on one body organ and its associated complications. The main objective was to map out the specifics of the work of the nurse working in the prison service of the Czech Republic whether within outpatient or inpatient wards. We were interested in what had motivated the nurses to work in the prison service of the Czech Republic, what her duties were and how the nursing care was carried out in the prison service of the Czech Republic. The research was done using qualitative research methods. The selected research technique was a semi-structured interview, which was developed based on valid standards and legislation and according to specialized literature related to the problems of the prison service of the Czech Republic. The results of the interviews were analysed by means of casuistries which then became the base for categorised charts and graphs. The research sample composed of six respondents who work as a general nurse in the prison service of the Czech Republic. By means of the research, we found out that the interviewed nurses work in compliance with valid standards and legislation. The nursing care is carried out {{in the form of a}} nursing process and the work of the interviewed nurses working in the prison service of the Czech Republic has its own specifics and differs especially in the approach to the prisoner/patient and in the communication with him/her. The most frequent specific facts of the work of the interviewed nurses were accompanying the prison service officers whether accompanying the respondents or a prisoner/patient, day-and-night locking, more administrative work. The motivation of the nurses to work in the prison service appeared to be an interesting salary, new experience and curiosity. The job description of the interviewed nurses in the prison service of the Czech Republic is defined by a given specialisation of a particular facility and internal rules of the facility where the interviewed nurses work. The thesis concluded that the interviewed nurses working in the prison service of the Czech Republic have got a different and specific job which is mainly influenced by the structure of the patients and the surroundings where the patients are located. It is a mentally-demanding job. In practice the results of the research could be used at the <b>specialised</b> <b>conference</b> for non-medical professions in healthcare or published in a specialised journal of health care...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The paper {{seeks to}} explore the ongoing {{development}} of an array of interdisciplinary specialist research areas in the accounting research community and its literature. It sets out to explore developments over the last 25 years with the aim to identify {{a number of important}} trends for the accounting scholarly community and to consider the role of AAAJ and various interdisciplinary accounting conferences and other journals. Design/methodology/approach – This paper employs a literature-based analysis, critique and argument. The paper's scope includes the trend towards specialisation by interdisciplinary accounting scholars in a contemporary context, where mainstream technical accounting research has privileged positivist research. Findings – In sharp contrast with the successful emergence of interdisciplinary research in the 1980 s, a trend towards at least a proportion of specialist research groupings is now seen, such as accounting historians, opting to retreat behind closed doors. Some researchers are increasingly exhibiting a trend towards seeking their own company focusing on attending only their <b>specialised</b> <b>conferences,</b> and publishing their work in their special interest journal. This carries a risk of retreating from engagement with the broader and particularly interdisciplinary accounting research community outside their own specialised confines. This could lead to fragmentation and fellow specialist researchers are invited to return to “the coming-out parade” and re-engage with the wider scholarly community. Research limitations/implications – Accounting scholars not only need to engage with their interdisciplinary specialised research areas, but also should connect with the wider scholarly community {{in order to maintain the}} pursuit of significant contribution to knowledge. Practical implications – The paper focuses on personal values of accounting academic scholars as well as the importance of specialised and more generalised interdisciplinary research scholarly groups. Originality/value – The paper alerts researchers to significant issues associated with the retreat into specialised groups and scholarly activities. It offers a practical illustration of a 25 -year history of accounting history research and calls for the coming-out of accounting scholars from specialist groups to an engagement with the broader accounting interdisciplinary research community. 12 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the necessity to}} consider the role of private rule making and the increasing importance of national regulatory agencies, {{in the process of}} European legal integration. It then focuses on the legislative design and process implementation of EPL. Its departing assumption is that EPL is and will remain a multilevel system where national implementation of European legislation generates intentional and unintentional spillover effects to be ‘governed’ through horizontal devices. The author underlines that the current legislative and judicial trend towards total harmonization is the wrong response to normative differentiation occurring in the process of national implementation. He analyses in particular the areas of unfair contract terms and commercial practices, providing examples of divergent implementation which can not be tackled only at legislative level, claiming that governance is a better response. He examines traditional modes of governance and then considers the applicability of new modes of governance to EPL. He makes several reform proposals; most of them do not require legislative intervention. At the legislative level, given that the competences are organised around policy areas while private law, following the national traditions, is conceptually organised around institutions, he proposes different ways to improve coordination at the Commission level, concerning legislative draft. Legislative drafting can also be improved by considering the different impacts of new legal categories in national legal systems, especially the general clauses. At the implementation level he emphasizes the role of judicial governance and the lack of coordination among national judiciaries proposing the establishment of a permanent judicial <b>conference</b> <b>specialised</b> in EPL to be coordinated with TFI and ECJ. He then proposes the institution of committees operating according to subjects (contract, property, tort) that would cut across directorates competences and would analyse the impact of European legislation on private law national systems. Finally he proposes the use of OMC, adequately redefined to evaluate the policy effects of implementation especially when it involves national regulatory agencies. governance...|$|R
