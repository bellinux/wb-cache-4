25|$|During construction, {{questions}} were publicly {{raised about the}} stability of the building's foundations in light of the water table on the site and the presence of a <b>subterranean</b> <b>stream.</b> Liebe conferred with the architect and engineers before developing a revised design which featured drains to divert running water. Liebe presented the modified plans to Molloy and proceeded with them, assuming that he had the consent of Molloy. Construction progressed, and the building was completed on schedule. When the time finally came for Molloy to pay Liebe for the construction, a dispute arose as to who should be liable for the extra £17,000 incurred in remedying the structural defect. Molloy was reputed {{to be one of the}} most litigious businessmen in Perth, and refused to pay higher than the original agreed price, on the basis that the contract required his written approval for extra work to be carried out. Liebe pursued him through the courts all the way to the High Court and Privy Council. The Privy Council eventually ruled in favour of Liebe, however the legal costs he had incurred were exorbitant.|$|E

50|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{administering}} water rights, California categorizes groundwater as either a <b>subterranean</b> <b>stream</b> flowing through a known and definite channel or percolating groundwater. Groundwater that is a <b>subterranean</b> <b>stream</b> {{is subject to the}} same water right permitting requirements as surface water. California has no statewide water right permit process for regulating the use of percolating groundwater. A <b>subterranean</b> <b>stream</b> meets the following four characteristics: (1) A subsurface channel must be present; (2) The channel must have relatively impermeable bed and banks; (3) The course of the channel must be known or capable of being determined by reasonable inference; and (4) Groundwater must be flowing in the channel.|$|E

5000|$|The cave {{which houses}} Ruby Falls was formed with the {{formation}} of Lookout Mountain. About 200 to 240 million years ago (in the Carboniferous Period, {{at the end of the}} Paleozoic Era) the eastern Tennessee area was covered with a shallow sea, the sediments of which eventually formed limestone rock. [...] About 200 million years ago, this area was uplifted and subsequent erosion has created the current topography. The limestone in which the cave is formed is still relatively horizontal, just as it was deposited when it was below sea level. The Lookout Mountain Caverns, which includes Ruby Falls Cave, is a limestone cave. These caves occur when slightly acidic groundwater enters <b>subterranean</b> <b>streams</b> and slowly dissolves the relatively soluble limestone, causing narrow cracks to widen into passages and caves in a process called chemical weathering. The stream which makes up the Falls entered the cave sometime after its formation.|$|R

40|$|The endemic Japanese frog Rana tagoi {{is unique}} among Holarctic brown frogs {{in that it}} breeds in small <b>subterranean</b> <b>streams.</b> Using {{mitochondrial}} 16 S ribosomal RNA and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 genes, we investigated genealogical relationships among geographic samples of this species together with its relative R. sakuraii, {{which is also a}} unique stream breeder. These two species together form a monophyletic group, within which both are reciprocally paraphyletic. Rana tagoi is divided into two major clades (Clade A and B) that are composed of 14 genetic groups. Rana sakuraii is included in Clade A and split into two genetic groups, one of which forms a clade (Subclade A- 2) with sympatric R. tagoi. This species-level paraphyly appears to be caused by incomplete taxonomy, in addition to introgressive hybridization and/or incomplete lineage sorting. Rana tagoi strongly differs from other Japanese anurans in its geographic pattern of genetic differentiation, most probably in relation to its unique reproductive habits. Taxonomically, R. tagoi surely includes many cryptic species...|$|R

A karst fenster is born from a caving in of portions of the roof of <b>subterranean</b> <b>stream,</b> thus making some of the underground stream visible from the surface (Ritter). Theories in the creation of karst topography and karst fensters involve vadose water above the water table and deep circulating phreatic water (water in the zone of saturation) eroding away subsurface rock.

50|$|Right away, {{the project}} ran into {{unexpected}} problems {{when it was}} discovered that the soil under the Velika Srbija inn is full of hardened loam as well as underground springs and <b>subterranean</b> <b>streams,</b> creating additional budgetary needs. Eighty-two wooden beams, 5m in length and 30 cm thick, were placed in the palace's foundation followed by 30 wagons of boiling iron in 9-meter long rods, and 10 wagons of hard Ripanj stone. A 2.2m thick concrete panel was then placed over the foundation. The brick-laying hadn't started until spring 1906. The construction work was performed by the civil engineer Karlo Knol and the bricklayers from Crna Trava while the supervising engineer was the project design architect Ilkić himself. Reinforced concrete part of the job was managed by architect Matija Šnajder. The surface of the outer walls from the second floor to the roof was lined with yellowish tiles decorated with green-coloured ornaments. The ceramic lining was brought in from the Zsolnay factory in Pécs, Austria-Hungary that reportedly to this day keeps the casts used to mold it.|$|R
5000|$|The cave {{was formed}} {{as a result of}} the marble formation's erosion during the Toarcian age of the Early Jurassic epoch, dating back to around 180 Ma. It {{consists}} of three interconnected caves and has three entrances, arranged into two separate floors. Each cave is different in hydrologic properties, stalactites and stalagmites. The total length of the Dupnisa Cave is 3200 m. Two caves, named [...] "Kuru" [...] ("Dry") and [...] "Kız" [...] ("Maiden"), are situated on the upper level running 2720 m, of which the lower cave, called [...] "Sulu" [...] ("Wet"), is located 60 m underneath. The [...] "Kuru" [...] is extremely rich in terms of stalactites, stalagmites, stalagnates and wall dripstones, reaching massive proportions. It is the source of the spring water flowing into Rezve Creek, the frontier between Turkey and Bulgaria. In contrast, the lower cave contains <b>subterranean</b> <b>streams</b> and lakes with draperies and boxworks over the lakes. The lower cave is at an elevation of 345 m AMSL.

50|$|The {{local economy}} was {{devastated by the}} mine's closure in 1993-94, which caused much bitterness. Like most Nottinghamshire mines, Cotgrave had {{continued}} working through the National Union of Mineworkers-declared 1984-85 miners' strike. Many took the view that this allegiance to the then Conservative government was betrayed. On its closure, {{it was reported that}} the seams had millions of tons of coal reserves but these were of insufficient quality. Local residents, however, recount that the mine was shut because of geological faults, the encounter of a <b>subterranean</b> <b>stream</b> and subsequent flood problems, and the growing remoteness of the seam face from the shaft, which drastically increased the cost of bringing the coal to the surface. The shafts were filled with concrete on closure and all associated buildings demolished.|$|E
50|$|The Aire starts {{its journey}} at Malham Tarn. It becomes a <b>subterranean</b> <b>stream</b> at 'Water Sinks' about 1 mile (1.6 km) before {{the top of}} Malham Cove, it then flows {{underground}} to Aire Head, just below Malham, in North Yorkshire, and then flows through Gargrave and Skipton. After Cononley, the river enters West Yorkshire where it passes through the former industrial areas of Keighley, Bingley, Saltaire and Shipley. It then passes through Leeds {{and on to the}} villages of Swillington and Woodlesford. At Castleford is the confluence of the Aire and Calder; just downstream of the confluence was the ford where the ancient British road, used by the Romans, crossed on its way north to York. The river re-enters North Yorkshire near Knottingley and in its lower reaches forms part of the boundary between North Yorkshire and the East Riding of Yorkshire.|$|E
50|$|Today {{the water}} course {{is marked by}} a stream that flows out of Malham Tarn 1.5 mi north of the cove. It becomes a <b>subterranean</b> <b>stream</b> at 'Water Sinks' about 1 mi before the top of the cove. Another stream named Malham Beck emerges from a cave {{at the bottom of the}} cove. The two streams were once thought to be one and the same. However, {{experiments}} with dyes have shown that they are two separate waterways that go underground at different locations. Their paths cross without mixing behind the limestone cliff re-emerging a few miles apart. The experiments show that there is complex system of caves and tunnels within the limestone cliff. The system is estimated to be about 50,000 years old. Cave divers, entering the system through the cave at the base of the cove, have so far explored about 1 mi.|$|E

50|$|Much of {{the parish}} is {{dominated}} by Carboniferous deposits deposited on the submarine platform of the Askrigg Block, which was a relatively high area forming a shelf sea buoyed up by Devonian Wensleydale Granite. It is separated from the Craven Basin {{to the south and}} west by the Craven Fault system. The lower Carboniferous deposits are dominated by the 200 m thick Great Scar limestones laid down during the Viséan stage. A mature karst landscape has formed where it outcrops, with bare limestone pavements, <b>subterranean</b> <b>streams,</b> and major solutional cave systems such as White Scar Caves and Meregill Hole. Scales Moor on the Whernside flanks of Chapel-le-Dale has one of the largest exposures of pavement in the Dales, measuring some 4 km long 800 m wide. On Whernside and Ingleborough above the flat plateau formed by the top of the Great Scar limestone, are the Brigantian and Namurian aged Yoredale cyclothem sequences of sandstone, limestone, and shales which were deposited {{on the edge of a}} huge delta. The upper ramparts of these hills are capped by thick beds of Grassington Grit, a course poorly-sorted sandstone laid down in shallower water as the delta prograded south.|$|R
60|$|It {{went down}} at an acute angle for some fifty feet, the floor being covered with broken stone. Thence there {{extended}} a long, straight passage {{cut in the}} solid rock. I am no geologist, but the lining of this corridor was certainly of some harder material than limestone, for there were points where I could actually see the tool-marks which the old miners had left in their excavation, as fresh {{as if they had}} been done yesterday. Down this strange, old-world corridor I stumbled, my feeble flame throwing a dim circle of light around me, which made the shadows beyond the more threatening and obscure. Finally, I came to a spot where the Roman tunnel opened into a water-worn cavern--a huge hall, hung with long white icicles of lime deposit. From this central chamber I could dimly perceive that a number of passages worn by the <b>subterranean</b> <b>streams</b> wound away into the depths of the earth. I was standing there wondering whether I had better return, or whether I dare venture farther into this dangerous labyrinth, when my eyes fell upon something at my feet which strongly arrested my attention.|$|R
