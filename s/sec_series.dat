Another carryover streak was that of Whit Merrifield, who set a USC record when he hit safely in his 26th game in a row during the March 10 contest against Valparaiso.

Mike Minor of Vanderbilt struck out eleven Razorback batters, only to be one-upped by Caleb Cotham's striking out twelve the following day. The two losses {{marked the first time}} Arkansas dropped consecutive games in 2009 as well as the first lost series for the Hogs.

The Razorbacks then caught a break by getting to host the Fayetteville Super Regional at Baum Stadium because Missouri State, the No. 8 national seed, couldn't host because it shares Hammons Field with the Springfield Cardinals. It took all three games of the best-of-3 series, but Arkansas defeated the Bears to clinch Van Horn's sixth trip to Omaha overall and fourth with the Razorbacks, tying him with former coach Norm DeBriyn.|$|E

The Sunday game was tied 2-2 until the eighth inning, when Brian McKinney cut and missed on a 3-2 pitch {{that went into the}} dirt. The runner advanced to first, when he unintentionally kicked the ball out of UF catcher Buddy Munroe's range. This allowed Ben Tschepikow to score from third base giving the Hogs the lead.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{characterize}} the socioeconomic profile of various geographic units, it is common practice to use aggregated indices. However, the process of calculating such indices requires {{a wide variety of}} variables from various data sources available concurrently. Using a number of administrative databases for 2001 and 2003, this study examines the question of whether dwelling prices in a given locality can serve as a proxy for its socioeconomic level. Based on statistical and geographic criteria, we developed a Dwelling Price Ranking (DPR) methodology. Our findings show that the DPR can serve as a good approximation for the socioeconomic cluster (SEC) calculated by the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics for years when the required data was available. As opposed to the SEC, the suggested DPR indicator can easily be calculated, thus ensuring a continuum of socioeconomic index series. Both parametric and nonparametric statistical analyses have been carried out in order to examine the additional social, demographic, location, crime and security effects that are exogenous to SEC. Complementary analysis on recently published <b>SEC</b> <b>series</b> for 2006 and 2008 show that our conclusions remain valid.

40|$|International audienceThe oceanic {{circulation}} {{entering the}} tropical southwest Pacific (SWP) {{is dominated by}} the broad westward flow of the South Equatorial Current (SEC), which is forced by the trade winds. It has been argued that the numerous islands of the SWP are able to restructure the <b>SEC</b> into a <b>series</b> of deep and narrow zonal jets, which control important pathways connecting equatorial and extraequatorial signals. The primary objective {{of this paper is to}} improve the understanding of the structure and dynamics of SWP zonal jets, giving special attention to topographic effects. This study is based on the use of a high-resolution regional oceanic model, whose solution is compared with observations, as well as with solutions from global models and the Sverdrup relation. The model used here indicates that the regional topography drives a general equatorward shift of the SEC, which is beneficial to the North Fiji, North Vanuatu, and North Caledonian jets. A depth-integrated vorticity budget shows that this topographic effect is considerably attenuated by baroclinicity and advection processes, but not to the point of total compensation as often admitted for the interior ocean. The effect of nonlinear advection is to allow flow rectification of the jets fluctuations, taking the form of zonally elongated dipole circulations in the leeward side of the islands...|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} {{a test of}} the market valuation impact of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) enforcement actions for foreign firms. I examine the SEC enforcement policy towards foreign firms under its jurisdiction. In contrast to Siegel (2005) who examines earlier years, I find that the SEC 2 ̆ 7 s current (post- 2002) enforcement intensity is considerable and has increased dramatically by comparison. I construct a novel test using the burgeoning <b>series</b> <b>SEC</b> enforcement events as changes to the legal environment that circumvents the issues associated with firm-level exchange-listing events (e. g. self-selection and simultaneous changes to firm traits). The tests focus on stock returns of foreign firms not targeted by the SEC during event windows surrounding SEC announcements of enforcements against foreign firms. This isolates the effect of a changing enforcement environment. I find that when the SEC takes action against a foreign firm, non-target foreign firms experience positive stock returns. Returns are amplified for firms from weaker home legal environments, suggesting that the returns are due to a perceived increase in SEC scrutiny. Finally, consistent with the market adjusting to the new enforcement regime, the magnitude of non-target firm returns declines with each sequential SEC enforcement action. The overall results provide evidence that SEC oversight plays a significant role in increasing the value of foreign firms, which supports the legal bonding hypothesis discussed in prior literature. ...|$|R
40|$|Two {{series of}} {{experiments}} were performed in nine healthy subjects. In series I, 96 single breath tests were performed in two subjects. The inspired gas contained 90 % O 2, 5 % He and 5 % SF 6 and {{the slope of the}} alveolar plateau for N 2, He and SF 6 was computed. The following experimental conditions were considered variable: inspired volume with preinspiratory lung volume equal to residual volume or functional residual capacity (FRC), both with and without 10 <b>sec</b> breath-holding. In <b>series</b> II, each of the other 7 subjects performed 12 single breath N 2 tests in which the subject inspired both 1 L and an inspiratory capacity (IC) of O 2 from FRC with and without 10 sec breath holding. The main experimental observation is that without breath-holding the absolute value of the slope of the alveolar plateau is larger for 1 L inspiration than for an IC inspiration, whereas this volume dependence was small after 10 sec of breath-holding. Based on Milic-Emili model of the lung and on simulations of a multibranch point model of the acinus we conclude that, in so far as these models adequately describe gas distribution in the lung, intraregional parallel units presenting a sequential convective flow {{play an important role in}} the genesis of the alveolar plateau.
