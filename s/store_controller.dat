5000|$|A {{copy of the}} 4690 OS is {{maintained}} in each <b>store</b> <b>controller.</b> The 4690 POS terminals (registers) load a copy of 4690 from the <b>store</b> <b>controller</b> into memory when they Initial Program Load (IPL). The 4690 controllers provide terminal support {{in the form of}} terminal loading, price lookup, and transaction logging. Non-volatile memory is utilized to ensure that data is not lost in transit from the terminals to the <b>store</b> <b>controller.</b> Terminals are assigned to a primary <b>store</b> <b>controller,</b> and that controller is typically backed up by another controller. If the primary controller fails, the terminals automatically access the backup controller, providing uninterrupted sales at the POS terminal. If both the primary and backup controllers are unavailable, the terminal can go into a standalone state, or, some of the applications are capable of supporting a [...] "Terminal Offline" [...] (TOF) state wherein terminals run offline using a terminal-based item file and logging stored within their own memory.|$|E

50|$|Early {{electronic}} cash registers (ECR) were controlled with proprietary software and were limited in function and communication capability. In August 1973, IBM released the IBM 3650 and 3660 store systems that were, in essence, a mainframe computer {{used as a}} <b>store</b> <b>controller</b> that could control up to 128 IBM 3653/3663 point of sale registers. This system was the first commercial use of client-server technology, peer-to-peer communications, local area network (LAN) simultaneous backup, and remote initialization. By mid-1974, it was installed in Pathmark stores in New Jersey and Dillard's department stores.|$|E
5000|$|IBM {{provides}} a [...] "Controller Matrix" [...] document {{with a list}} of compatible IBM servers for use with 4690 OS as <b>store</b> <b>controllers</b> and controller/terminals. These servers represent current and formerly available devices which continue to be supported by 4690.|$|R
50|$|The 2980 was {{initially}} {{the most powerful}} of ICL's New Range mainframe computers. In addition to the OCPs, it consisted of a <b>store</b> multiple access <b>controller</b> (SMAC) and one or more <b>store</b> access <b>controllers</b> (SAC), a general peripheral controller (GPC), one or more disc file controllers (DFC) and a communications link controller (CLC), together with disc drives (a typical configuration would have eight EDS 200 drives), tape decks, an operating station (OPER), line printers and card readers. It supported the VME/B, VME/K and Edinburgh Multiple Access System (EMAS) operating systems. A typical 2980 configuration would cost about £2 million.|$|R
5000|$|The {{controllers}} are {{a joystick}} without a base; {{the main body}} is a large hand grip with a triangular [...] "cap" [...] on top, the top being the portion that actually moved for eight-way directional control. It {{could be used as}} both a joystick and paddle (twist), and not only could it be pushed down to operate as a fire button it could be pulled up as well. The model 1 unit contained a small compartment for <b>storing</b> the <b>controllers</b> when moving it. The System II featured detachable controllers and had two holders at the back to wind the cable around and to <b>store</b> the <b>controller</b> in. Zircon later offered a special control which featured an action button {{on the front of the}} joystick. It was marketed by Zircon as [...] "Channel F Jet-Stick" [...] in a letter sent out to registered owners before Christmas 1982.|$|R
5000|$|... 4690 {{supports}} {{a number of}} Point of Sale (POS) terminal devices, <b>store</b> <b>controller</b> servers, and combination controller/terminals. The 4690 documentation contains a list of supported POS devices, including devices {{that have been in}} use over 20 years. The family of IBM USB POS devices that 4690 supports includes keyboards, displays, and cash drawers. 4690 also supports other I/O devices that are designed to and conform to IBM's USB POS device interface specifications. IBM makes interface specifications available to third-party vendors to enable them to connect their devices to POS terminals using RS485, RS232, and USB connections.|$|E
5000|$|Perhaps {{the most}} notable feature of the 4690 OS {{is its ability to}} provide a [...] "redundancy infrastructure". IBM {{designed}} the 4690 OS to work either as a single server, or with one or more other 4690 servers. These servers are commonly called [...] "store controllers". When connected in a LAN, these 4690 store controllers provide redundant backup using mirrored data files. Using a system of [...] "master controller", [...] "alternate master", [...] "file server", and [...] "alternate file server" [...] designations, the controllers preserve data integrity and allow file backup in the event that a <b>store</b> <b>controller</b> fails and needs to be replaced.|$|E

Workloa& often require predictable quality of service, deslite {{the fact that they have}} to compete with other rapidly-changing workloads for access to common storage resources. We present a novel approach to providing performance guarantees in this highly-volatile scenario, in an efficient and cost-effective way. Facade, a virtual <b>store</b> <b>controller,</b> sits between hosts and storage devices in the network, and throttles individual I/ 0 requests from multiple clients so that devices do not saturate. We implemented a prototype, and evaluated it using real workloads on an enterprise storage system. We also instantiated it to the particular case of emulating commercial disk arrays. Our results show that Facade satisfies performance objectives while making efficient use of the storage resources [...] -even in the presence of of failures and bursty workloads with stringent performance requirements...|$|E

The system is entirely contactless, with validation activated by holding the ticket {{a short distance}} {{in front of the}} reader for about a second. Teams of ticket inspectors make random checks across the network with hand-held ticket readers.|$|R

40|$|Energy {{consumption}} {{is the biggest}} issue in wireless sensor network and mobile devices. In this proposed model, available radio signals {{in the region are}} converted to DC supply and stored in a battery. This power RF harvesting conversion is done by P 2110. From the <b>stored</b> energy, <b>controllers</b> which operate at 5 V can be powered. Microcontroller measures environmental parameter and transmits it to the co-ordinator.

50|$|The controller's main {{function}} is to switch the circulating pump on or off. The pump is usually switched on when the solar panel is hotter than {{the water in the}} store's heat exchanger and off when the panel is colder. Switching the pump on transfers the heat in the panel to the store. Switching it off when the panels cool prevents a reversal of the process and loss of heat from the <b>store.</b> The <b>controller</b> measures and compares the temperatures in the panel and the heat exchanger every few seconds.|$|R

Next, there is also the actual start of the application, which shows what is to be run on the start screen or immediately after the application starts.|$|R
50|$|TRS's {{have greater}} risks to {{overcome}} than conventional radio systems in that {{a loss of}} the <b>store</b> manager (site <b>controller)</b> would cause the system's traffic to no longer be managed. In this case, {{most of the time}} the TRS will automatically switch to an alternate control channel, or in more rare circumstances, conventional operation. In spite of these risks, TRS's usually maintain reasonable uptime.|$|R
40|$|Different {{paint and}} {{hardening}} components are meter fed from supply containers (1, 6) through the respective separate changeover units (2, 5) of a mixer unit (8) {{and then through}} an applicator (9) {{by means of a}} <b>stored</b> programmable <b>controller</b> controlled by feed units (7). The piping system, the changeover units, the feed units and mixing unit can be cleaned by flushing by a fluid prepared in a container (4).

30|$|The {{geographic}} location representation and related information dissemination protocol proposed in PolyViNE {{is inspired by}} the previous proposals of geographic addressing and routing in IPv 6 networks [14, 20] {{as well as the}} predominant global routing protocol in the Internet, BGP [21]. However, unlike these works, PolyViNE does not use the information for addressing or routing purposes; rather it uses the location information to find candidate InPs that will be able to embed part or whole of the remaining unmapped VN request. Moreover, such location information is disseminated between and <b>stored</b> in <b>Controllers</b> instead of border routers as in BGP or GIRO [14]. The concepts of Controllers in InPs and controller network connecting multiple InPs’ Controllers are discussed in the iMark framework [10].|$|R
50|$|A typical {{use for a}} small {{rechargeable}} battery (in coin or other format) is {{to back up the}} settings of equipment which is normally permanently mains-powered, in the case of power failure. For example, many central heating <b>controllers</b> <b>store</b> operation times and similar information in volatile memory, lost in the case of power failure. It is usual for such systems to include a backup battery, either disposable in a holder (current drain is extremely low and life is long) or soldered-in rechargeable.|$|R
50|$|In Ethernet networks, each network {{interface}} controller has a unique Media Access Control (MAC) address—usually <b>stored</b> in the <b>controller's</b> permanent memory. To avoid address conflicts between network devices, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) maintains and administers MAC address uniqueness. The size of an Ethernet MAC address is six octets. The three most significant octets are reserved to identify NIC manufacturers. These manufacturers, using only their assigned prefixes, uniquely assign the three least-significant octets of every Ethernet interface they produce.|$|R

The new protocol was incompatible with the earlier version but Central Station could be set to send either protocol to any decoder so older locomotives could be controlled alongside mfx equipped locomotives. The Central Station incorporated all functionality of the earlier keyboard, memory, and interface modules as well as being able to control up to 8 automatic shuttle (point to point) trains.|$|R

30|$|The {{methodology}} for {{management of resources}} in Eucalyptus is predominantly reliant upon establishing a control structure between nodes, such that one cluster is managed by one second-tier controller, which is managed by a centralized cloud controller. In the case of Eucalyptus, there are five controller types: cloud controller, cluster controller, block-based storage controller (EBS), bucket-based storage controller (S 3), and node controller. The cloud controller is responsible for managing attributes of the cloud, such as the registration of controllers, access control management, as well as facilitating user interaction through command-line and, in some cases, web-based interfacing. The cluster controller is responsible for managing a cluster of node controllers, which entails transmission of control messages for instantiation of virtual machine images and other necessities required for compute nodes. Block-based storage controllers provide an abstract interface for creation of storage blocks, which are dynamically allocated virtual storage devices that can be utilized as persistent storage. Bucket-based storage controllers are not allocated as block-level devices, but instead are treated as containers by which files, namely virtual machine images, may be <b>stored.</b> Node <b>controllers</b> are responsible for hosting virtual machine instances and for facilitating remote access via RDP [22], SSH [23], VNC [24], and other remote access protocols.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we report}} robot {{experimental}} results of balance control and torque pattern learning under the influ-ence of periodic external force. In the previous paper, we propose {{not only a}} control method for keeping balance based on the feedback of ground reaction forces but also a learning method of torque pattern for balancing in such a stationary environment as a periodic external force is exerted. In {{order to maintain the}} balance, the feedback of ground reaction forces is essential. As a result of learning, however, the information on them become unnecessary because the torque pattern for balancing is <b>stored</b> in the <b>controller</b> and thus the balancing is achieved in a feedforward manner. Here, we aim at verifying this control and learning scheme by experiments with a simple robot. I...|$|R
50|$|Over {{the past}} decades {{different}} instruments (either laboratory built or commercially available) to measure bacterial concentration using impedance microbiology have been built. One {{of the best}} selling and well accepted instruments in the industry is the Bactometer by Biomerieux.

The system is composed of a thermoregulated incubation chamber where the sample under test is <b>stored</b> and a <b>controller</b> for thermoregulation and impedance measurements.|$|R
40|$|Optimal {{coordination}} of traffic signals requires proper activation of timing plans to match current traffic conditions. One {{of the greatest}} challenges in configuring a traffic responsive plan selection control mode is how to select only n number of timing plans (restricted by traffic controller memory limitations) to address possibly all traffic conditions/states that can be encountered in the field, for a specific site, but most importantly, how to associate each of these traffic conditions to one of the n timing plans stored in the traffic controller. This paper uses a multiobjective non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm to (1) select the best n timing plans to be <b>stored</b> in the <b>controller</b> and (2) group traffic states into m number of clusters, and associate each of the m clusters with one of the stored timing plans. A new performance measure, degree of detachment, developed by the writers to address the clustering requirements, is described in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} a fuzzy error correction control system used to navigate a robot along an easily modifiable path in a well-structured environment. An array of Hall sensors {{mounted on the}} bottom of a robot gathers sensory information from a path of ferromagnetic disks placed on the ground. This sensory input is processed by an analog-to-digital converter and the output signals are then inputted into a fuzzy logic engine. The fuzzy engine out-puts commands for the robot wheels. These commands determine the necessary angle of rotation to correct the direction of travel in order for the robot to remain on the path. The fuzzy logic <b>controller</b> <b>stores</b> prior disk information to predict a path trajectory when no path is detected. If the controller then senses a path, it anchors on it and starts following it.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / September 28 - 30, 1976 / Hyatt House Hotel, Los Angeles, CaliforniaWe {{consider}} a communication medium, {{such as a}} satellite communication channel, which is shared {{by a number of}} sources on a time-division multiple-access (TDMA) basis. Sources require real-time transmission over the channel. A central <b>controller</b> <b>stores</b> the requests for transmission by the sources and assigns the freed slots within the time-frame to the appropriate sources, following a dynamic demand-assignment access control discipline. Sources are further assumed to require real-time transmission at different information rates, and thus require different number of slots per frame. Two access-control disciplines are studied, structurally optimized, and compared. A fixed-assignment discipline divides the frame slots among the various source classes on a predetermined basis. A priority-assignment discipline dynamically modifies the latter division by allowing one class of requests to utilize the freed slots of the other. The analysis demonstrates {{the extent to which the}} second scheme is preferrable, incorporating a message maximal waiting-time objective function and adaptability considerations...|$|R
40|$|Because of {{increasingly}} demanding energy programs and initiatives, it {{is required to}} maintain high efficiency in various DC-DC converter applications over wide ranges of operating conditions. To achieve these efficiency goals, this thesis introduces an efficiency optimization approach, which {{can be applied to}} given power stages. In the proposed optimization approach, power stage design parameters and controller parameters are concurrently optimized over a range of operating conditions based on power loss models and multi-variable non-linear constrained optimization. A digital controller facilitates on-line efficiency optimization by <b>storing</b> the optimum <b>controller</b> parameters in a look-up table. A flyback DC-DC converter, commonly used in low output power applications, is adopted for experimental verifications of the proposed optimization approach. A valley switching technique is employed to significantly decrease MOSFET turn-on switching loss in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM), and solutions to a problem related to undesirable frequency hopping, commonly observed in other valley switching schemes, are proposed and discussed. A gain-scheduled compensator and a new control scheme, named k-control, are implemented for consistent transient responses over different operating conditions. Finally, simplified sensing and analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion techniques are proposed, targeting a low-cost, small-size and low-pin-count (≤ 8) digital controller IC chip implementation...|$|R
40|$|Controller {{synthesis}} for aerospace applications {{is typically}} complex, also said multi-objective. It {{is not unusual}} to combine different design techniques, where each one must be tuned appropriately in order {{to comply with the}} required specifications. Furthermore, if one considers gain scheduling, then the same set of procedures must be repeated for each single operating point, with additional constraints on controller interpolation. The resulting complexity can even increase once that robustness and fault tolerance are mostly necessary, which confirms the challenging nature of the entire conception and development of such systems. By the other side, the combination of observer-based approaches with intelligent computation provides some answers to this difficult task, as it will be shown in this work. Firstly, a robust controller is automatically designed by computational intelligence, with a genetic algorithm that searches a parameter space of considerable dimensions, according to the ratings given by a fuzzy system, where the specifications are <b>stored.</b> Subsequently, the <b>controller</b> found undergoes an internal reorganization following its observer-based form, where the state variables are meaningful (= physical) estimates. A faulty operation in a launcher attitude control system demonstrates the appeal of the proposed techniques...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{develops the}} theory of symmetry for constrained linear systems. We use symmetry to design model predictive controllers for constrained linear systems with reduced complexity. The dissertation {{is divided into three}} parts. In the first part we review the relevant results from model predictive control and group theory. In particular we present algorithms and data structures from computational group theory used to efficiently search groups. In the second part we develop {{the theory of}} symmetry for constrained linear systems and model predictive control problems. Symmetries of constrained linear systems are linear transformations that preserve the dynamics and constraints. A symmetry of a model predictive control problem is a symmetry of the underlying constrained system that also preserves the cost. We use a group theoretic formalism to derive properties of symmetric constrained linear systems and symmetric model predictive control problems. We prove conditions under which the model predictive controller is symmetric and present a procedure for efficiently computing the symmetries of constrained linear systems and model predictive control problems. Our method transforms the problem of finding generators for the symmetry group into a graph automorphism problem. These symmetries are used to design model predictive control algorithms with reduced complexity. We also present two novel explicit model predictive control designs. Both reduce memory requirements by discarding symmetrically redundant pieces of the control-law. The control-law in the eliminated pieces can be reconstructed online using symmetry. We show that storing the symmetries of the problem requires less memory than <b>storing</b> the <b>controller</b> pieces. In the third part of this dissertation we apply our symmetry theory to the battery balancing problem. We use symmetry to reduce the memory requirements for explicit model predictive controllers for seven battery-balancing hardware designs proposed in the literature. This application demonstrates that our symmetric controller designs can significantly reduce the memory requirements of explicit model predictive control. In particular for four out of seven of the designs in our numerical study, the number of pieces in the symmetric controller did not increase as the battery pack-size was increased...|$|R
