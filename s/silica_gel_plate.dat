30|$|CAMAG TLC system {{consist of}} a CAMAG Linomat V (Muttenz, Switzerland) sample {{applicator}} and CAMAG TLC Scanner 3 controlled by WinCats software (1.4. 3.6336); CAMAG glass twin-trough chambers (20 [*]×[*] 10 [*]×[*] 4  cm 3); 100 -μl Hamilton syringe; <b>Silica</b> <b>gel</b> <b>plates</b> (G 60 F 254, 20 [*]×[*] 10  cm) were procured from E-Merck Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai, India. For extraction of vanillin, Buchi evaporator system was used consisting of Buchi evaporator R- 124, Buchi water bath B- 480, and Buchi vacuum controller B- 721.|$|R
40|$|From the alkalised crude extract of Symphytum cordatum (L.) W. K. roots, pyrrolizidine {{alkaloids}} (PAs) were extracted as free tertiary bases and polar N-oxides in a merely one-step liquid-liquid partitioning (LLP) in separation funnel and subsequently pre-fractionated by preparative multiple-development (MD) thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on <b>silica</b> <b>gel</b> <b>plates.</b> In this way three alkaloid fractions of different polarities and retention on <b>silica</b> <b>gel</b> <b>plates</b> were obtained as: the most polar N-oxides {{of the highest}} retention, the tertiary bases of medium retention, and diesterified N-oxides of the lowest retention. The former fraction was reduced into free bases by sodium hydrosulfite and purified by LLP on Extrelut-NT 3 cartridge. It was further analysed together with the two other fractions by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) -ion-trap mass spectrometry with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCl) interface on XTerra C- 18 column using a gradient elution. Based on MSn spectra, 18 various alkaloids have been tentatively determined {{for the first time}} in this plant as the following types of structure: echimidine-N-oxide (three diasteroisomers), 7 -sarracinyl- 9 -viridifloryiretronecine (two diasteroisomers), echimidine (two diasteroisomers), lycopsamine (two diasteroisomers), dihydroechinatine-N-oxide, dihydroheliospathuline-N-oxide, lycopsamine-N-oxide (three diasteroisomers), 7 -acetyllycopsamine-N-oxide, symphytine-N-oxide (two diasteroisomers) and 2 '', 3 ''-epoxyechiui-nine-N-oxide.
