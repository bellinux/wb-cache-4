50|$|The {{most common}} measure of roller chain's {{strength}} is tensile strength. Tensile strength represents how much load a chain can withstand under a one-time load before breaking. Just {{as important as}} tensile strength is a chain's fatigue strength. The critical factors in a chain's fatigue strength {{is the quality of}} steel used to manufacture the chain, the heat treatment of the chain components, the quality of the pitch hole fabrication of the linkplates, and the type of shot plus the intensity of <b>shot</b> <b>peen</b> coverage on the linkplates. Other factors can include the thickness of the linkplates and the design (contour) of the linkplates. The rule of thumb for roller chain operating on a continuous drive is for the chain load to not exceed a mere 1/6 or 1/9 of the chain's tensile strength, {{depending on the type of}} master links used (press-fit vs. slip-fit). Roller chains operating on a continuous drive beyond these thresholds can and typically do fail prematurely via linkplate fatigue failure.|$|E

In {{order to}} develop {{surfaces}} that have the proper curvature for aerospace structures, it is sometimes necessary to use <b>shot</b> <b>peen</b> forming, also known as contour forming, to create the desired shape {{in a piece of}} metal. Since the preferred metal in aerospace continues to be aluminum and its alloys, this study will concentrate on the effects of shot peening on aluminum. Typically, shot intensity is measured using standard Almen strips made from cold rolled SAE 1070 spring steel. Since the effects of the shot on aluminum is the chief concern of this study, aluminum strips of the same size and thickness will be used to determine the intensity of the shot on aluminum parts. These strips will be exposed for different amounts of time to different intensities, measured using the steel Almen strips, and then the intensity (or arc height) will be measured on the aluminum strips. The residual stresses in these strips will then be measured using the hole drill method (ASTM E 837). The stresses from the residual stress test will then be used to develop a finite element model that simulates the aluminum strips and the deformation in them. The model will then be calibrated with the empirical data. From there, it will be the goal of this study to be able to predict the deformation of aluminum parts when exposed to certain <b>shot</b> <b>peen</b> intensities. This will enable more efficient contour forming processes with less rework. Furthermore, the trial and error of a manual process can be avoided with the use of robotics.

Such a model was generated through the application of statistical inference methods – multivariable regression and neural networks – to a set of experimental data concerning the application of peen forming processes to a group of 215 aluminium 7050 alloy rectangular plates.

40|$|The {{nature and}} scope of this thesis {{can be divided into}} three categories, namely stress {{distribution}} modelling in coil springs; fatigue and failure analysis, an investigation into measurement of residual stresses and the relation to fatigue life. The operation of springs is directly concerned with the theories of torsion and bending which makes the better understanding of these theories essential. The first part of the thesis is involved with a mathematical evaluation of these theories and a case study of an isolated loop of a coil spring. The mathematical modelling is verified by measuring the strain levels in a coil spring with the aid of strain gauges located at different positions in the coil spring. This evaluation gave {{a better understanding of the}} operational stress distribution for input into the two methods currently used by industry for the fatigue testing, namely isolated loop and complete coil spring samples. The remaining part of the thesis revolves around the understanding of the relationship between fatigue life, process effects and residual stresses. The relationship between fatigue failures and process effects was investigated to reveal the mechanism responsible for component fatigue failure in a 55 Cr 3 automotive suspension spring steel. This was done by subjecting coil springs, withdrawn from different stages of the manufacturing process, to fatigue tests, ensuring that all possible sources of fatigue initiation in this material batch have been identified, including those not dominant in the finished component. Failures prior to <b>shot</b> <b>peen</b> process was mainly surface relate as where those withdrawn after this process were subsurface (inclusions) related.

40|$|Fretting fatigue is a damage {{process that}} may arise in {{engineering}} applications where small cyclic relative displacements develop inside contacts leading to detrimental {{effects on the}} material fatigue properties. Fretting is located in regions not easily accessible, which makes it a dangerous phenomenon. It is therefore important {{to be able to make}} reliable predictions of the fretting fatigue lives. The work presented in this thesis has its focus on different aspects related to fretting fatigue in the titanium alloy Ti- 17. A fretting experiment was developed which allowed for separate control of the three main fretting loads. Initially, the evolution of the coefficient of friction inside the slip region was investigated experimentally and analytically. Subsequently, 28 fretting tests were performed in which large fatigue cracks developed. The fretting tests were firstly evaluated with respect to fatigue crack initiation through five multiaxial fatigue criteria. The criteria predicted a too high fretting fatigue limit. A possible clue to the discrepancy was found in the fretting induced surface roughness with the asperity-pit interactions. The fatigue growth of the large fretting cracks was numerically modelled through a parametric crack growth procedure. The predicted lives were compared to the experimental outcome. The numerical simulations showed that linear elastic fracture mechanics was an appropriate tool for the prediction of fretting fatigue propagation lives in the long crack regime. Fatigue cracks spend most of their propagation life in the small crack regime. The possibility of modelling the small crack behaviour is therefore very important from the engineering point of view. The fatigue growth of through thickness short cracks was studied experimentally and numerically in the four-point bend configuration. It was found that linear elastic fracture mechanics and closure-free material growth data furnished conservative estimates for cracks longer than 50 μm. One method to improve fretting fatigue life is to <b>shot</b> <b>peen</b> the contact surfaces. Experimental results on fretting life with or without shot peening were simulated.

Fatigue crack aspect ratio (a/c) evolution {{in the early stages}} of crack growth in polished and <b>shot</b> <b>peened</b> cases was found to be quite different: the former was more microstructure dependent (e. g. stringer initiation) while the crack morphology in the <b>shot</b> <b>peened</b> cases was more related to the <b>shot</b> <b>peening</b> process (i. e. surface roughness, position with respect to the compressive stress and strain hardening profiles). Under similar strain range conditions, the beneficial effect of <b>shot</b> <b>peening</b> (in the T 0 condition) was retained even at a high strain level (?? 11 = 0. 68 %), Nf, ground< Nf, T 1 < Nf, polished < Nf, T 0. The a/c evolution effects were incorporated in K-evaluations and used in calculating da/dN from surface replica data. Apparent residual stress (based on crack driving force ?K difference) was applied to describe the benefit of <b>shot</b> <b>peening</b> and was seen to extend significantly below the measured residual stress profile, indicating the importance of the strain hardening layer and stress redistribution effects during crack growth...|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{performed}} at Scania CV AB and aimed {{to optimize the}} effect of <b>shot</b> <b>peening</b> {{in order to increase}} the bending fatigue limit of planetary gears. In this project three parameters affecting the performance of the <b>shot</b> <b>peening</b> were examined in more detail, specifically the hardness of the <b>shot</b> <b>peening</b> media, the hardness of the material and the amount retained austenite. <b>Shot</b> <b>peening</b> and measurements were performed on carburized gears consisting of ss 92506 steel. In order to find out how the fatigue limit is affected by the material hardness, a number of gears were tempered whereas other remained untempered. Similarly the retained austenite content was altered in some of the gears with a cryotreatment. The <b>shot</b> <b>peening</b> of these gears {{was performed}} by dual <b>shot</b> <b>peening</b> using media of two different hardness. The fatigue limit was evaluated by a servo hydraulic material testing machine. The results show that the fatigue limit is enhanced when the <b>shot</b> <b>peening</b> was performed with hard media. This was expected since the harder media can cause larger plastic deformation in the material giving rise to larger compressive residual stresses which is known to increase the fatigue limit. The fatigue limit was also improved for samples with lower surface hardness. The amount of retained austenite does not seem to affect the fatigue limit for samples <b>shot</b> <b>peened</b> with media of sufficient hardness in order to cause adequate plastic deformation. The surface roughness remained unchanged for samples <b>shot</b> <b>peened</b> by different media, which indicates that this parameter should not hinder a change of media...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we propose a new method for {{improving}} the surface strength and reliability of ceramics that combines <b>shot</b> <b>peening</b> with crack-healing ability. We used Si 3 N 4 /SiC composite ceramics with high crack-healing ability and subjected the specimens to <b>shot</b> <b>peening</b> and crack healing. To evaluate the effect of our method, we investigated the residual stress after <b>shot</b> <b>peening</b> and crack healing and examined the specimens’ mechanical properties, including apparent fracture resistance, contact strength and bending strength. We found that <b>shot</b> <b>peening</b> and crack healing is effective to increase apparent fracture resistance, contact strength and bending strength...|$|R
