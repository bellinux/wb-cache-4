50|$|The biggest {{point of}} {{difference}} between the first record and this one <b>is</b> the time <b>we</b> took preparing. The preparation time for the first album was like, {{a couple of years}} on the road. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>basically</b> like a garage pop band who went into a studio. Dennis didn't really give us the chance to develop or grow beyond that. It <b>was</b> like what <b>we</b> knew went onto the record. This time it was... like an exam. We studied way harder; just the preparation was far more intense. Once we had {{a pretty good idea of}} what everything was going to sound like, we didn't need much time in the studio, because we had spent six months working on the demos.|$|R
5000|$|Some reviews {{were less}} positive. Film critic Roger Ebert gave Scanners {{two out of}} four stars and wrote, Scanners <b>is</b> <b>so</b> lockstep that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>basically</b> reduced to {{watching}} the special effects, which are good but curiously abstract, because we don't much care about the people they're happening around". In his review for The New York Times, Vincent Canby wrote, [...] "Had Mr. Cronenberg settled simply for horror, as John Carpenter did in his classic Halloween (though not in his not-so-classic The Fog), Scanners {{might have been a}} Grand Guignol treat. Instead he insists on turning the film into a mystery, and mystery demands eventual explanations that, when they come in Scanners, underline the movie's essential foolishness".|$|R

"I <b>was</b> {{thinking}} that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>basically</b> taking the Burt Ward Robin and sticking {{him in the}} Batmobile with the Zack Snyder/Ben Affleck Batman, or the Frank Miller Batman. And putting these two different energies together. Somebody who’s like the grumpiest, dark grittiest, broodiest Batman with the most positive, indefatigable kid." ...|$|R
5000|$|It's {{about the}} {{fleeting}}, fickle nature {{of love and}} romance. It's also about the fleeting nature of fame, especially in the music business. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>basically</b> saying, 'Look, <b>we</b> know we're red hot right now but {{we also know that}} somebody's going to come along and replace us — both in music and in love.' ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2011, {{despite having}} {{an annual budget}} of close to $10 million, Gregg (then being {{referred}} to as the Director of Finance) denied that the business was very profitable. In an interview with Canadian Sailings, he stated: [...] "There is not {{a lot of money to}} <b>be</b> made... <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>basically</b> paid a management fee to operate the vessels for the government." ...|$|R
5000|$|During a podcast {{featuring}} vocalist Cristina Scabbia, she {{was questioned}} {{about the concept}} of the album and responded with; [...] "We just realized it <b>was</b> a concept <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>basically</b> living in." [...] She also elusively detailed a personal incident involving mental illness that happened within her family which thereby initiated visits to modern day mental health facilities and stated she was [...] "really, really close to this matter".|$|R
50|$|<b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>basically</b> a Beatles band {{to start}} with. We did all Beatles tunes. Then we started {{branching}} out. We {{also liked the}} Byrds and the Animals. It wasn’t long after our first show at Everett High School that we played Waverly Junior High School — we nearly started a riot. It was {{like something out of}} ‘Hard Day’s Night.’ We had a big local following; there were about 300 kids in our fan club.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>basically</b> {{discussing}} on a {{class of}} Baranchik type shrinkage estimators of the vector parameter in a location model, with errors belonging to a sub-class of elliptically contoured distributions. We derive conditions under Schwartz space in which the underlying class of shrinkage estimators outperforms the sample mean. Sufficient conditions on dominant class to outperform the usual James-Stein estimator are also established. It is nicely presented that the dominant properties {{of the class of}} estimators are robust truly respect to departures from normality...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{approach}} for normalizing Arabic Dictionaries. This approach {{is used to}} transform non structured Arabic dictionaries into LMF (Lexical Markup Framework) based-normalized ones. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>basically</b> exploiting Arabic Islamic dictionaries of hadith. An ontology will be then constructed from these normalized dictionaries. This ontology will contain explicit and formal knowledge about information in hadith. It will be used later by an information retrieval system for Word Sense Disambiguation of Arabic terms of hadith either in the formulated user query or in the texts of hadith...|$|R

Stacy said [...] "I think <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>basically</b> pretty certain {{this is the last}} tour of this type we'll be doing in the States. There might be the odd sort of one-off here and there. We're not saying this is absolutely, {{definitely}} the end." ...|$|R

5000|$|The event's {{organizers}} {{insisted on}} the timing being a mere coincidence, with Coogler explaining the date was chosen because it falls on the last weekend of this year's Black History Month. Nevertheless, the event has been regarded as an alternative for those disappointed with this year's Oscars. In an interview with Katie Couric, co-initiator DuVernay said: [...] "I guess I can see how people are making the connection, but we didn’t {{have anything to do}} that night. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> free. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>basically</b> saying on this night, there are other things going on around issues of justice and dignity." ...|$|R

The interview description given for the first interview sequence applies here as well. An interview begins with the grand tour question, 2 ̆ 2 If there is any kind of order in the world, where do people fit in that order? 2 ̆ 2 The informant 2 ̆ 7 s response is followed with three elicitation devices...|$|R
5000|$|However, {{throughout}} the 2007 season the team {{suffered from the}} in-fighting between Alonso and Hamilton. In the Alonso vs. Hamilton conflict, Dennis always advocated treating his two drivers equally. However, after the 2007 Chinese Grand Prix, he said [...] "We weren't racing Kimi, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>basically</b> racing Fernando." [...] The Times said his comments [...] "made a nonsense of his claims to be treating his drivers equitably in the World Championship run-in" [...] but the team's insistence on parity until the very final race in Brazil underlined Dennis's core philosophy even if it ultimately lost the team the world championship.|$|R

40|$|The {{contribution}} {{presents an}} approach for motion capturing (MoCap) of dressed people. A cloth draping method {{is embedded in}} a silhouette based MoCap system and an error functional is formalized to minimize image errors with respect to silhouettes, pose and kinematic chain parameters, the cloth draping components and external wind forces. We report on various experiments with two types of clothes, namely a skirt {{and a pair of}} shorts. Finally we compare the angles of the MoCap system with results from a commercially available marker based tracking system. The experiments show, that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>basically</b> within the error range of marker based tracking systems, though body parts are occluded with cloth...|$|R
40|$|The {{human body}} {{involves}} the complex interaction between many feedback systems. This is certainly indicative that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>basically</b> a nonlinear organism. Recent {{developments in the}} understanding of nonlinear systems suggest that fractal (power law) relationships may be the rule, not the exception. In this article it is shown that the performance of male and female superior athletes exhibits a fractal relationship between world record running and swimming times and the distance of the event. Furthermore, the precision of this relationship is so accurate that the small deviations exhibited by data from a fractal fit might be explained using the dominant interplay between aerobic and anaerobic energy expenditure...|$|R
