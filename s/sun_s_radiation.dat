40|$|Over 40 years ago, NASA {{developed}} Radiant Barrier {{technology to}} protect astronauts in the Apollo Program from temperatures {{that ranged from}} 250 F above to 400 F below zero Fahrenheit. This feat in temperature control technology enabled the astronauts to work inside the Apollo Command Module wearing short-sleeve shirts, with temperatures {{similar to those of}} a regular business office. The Radiant Barrier has been applied to virtually all spacecraft since then, including unmanned spacecraft with delicate instruments that need protection from temperature extremes. It is also applied to the astronauts space suits, protecting them during space walks. Made of aluminized polymer film, the Radiant Barrier both bars and lets in heat to maintain a consistent temperature in an environment where ordinary insulation methods will not suffice. The aluminization of the material provides a reflective surface that keeps more than 95 percent of the radiated energy in space from reaching the spacecraft s interior. In space suits, the thin and flexible material reflects the astronauts body heat back to them for warmth, {{while at the same time}} reflecting the <b>sun</b> <b>s</b> <b>radiation</b> away from them to keep them cool.

40|$|Abstract The key {{to success}} of replantation of totally avulsed teeth is {{periodontal}} ligament activity. Improving the activity of periodontal ligament cell is beneficial to the success rate of tooth replantation. Objectives: To observe the changes in proliferation of human periodontal ligament fibroblasts cultured in vitro after Er:YAG laser irradiation. Methods: Conventional immumohistochemical staining was performed on human periodontal ligament fibroblasts cultured in vitro which was obtained from teeth root surface to identify the cell source. The fifth generation of human periodontal ligament fibroblasts collected were randomly divided into 5 groups, with group A as the control group receiving no laser irradiation, and experimental groups receiving different energies of Er:YAG laser radiation, respectively. The parameters were 50 mJ, 10 Hz and 1 <b>s</b> <b>radiation</b> in B group; 100 mJ, 10 Hz and 1 <b>s</b> <b>radiation</b> in C group; 150 mJ, 10 Hz and 1 <b>s</b> <b>radiation</b> in D group; 200 mJ, 10 Hz and 1 <b>s</b> <b>radiation</b> in E group. Cell growth was detected by CCK- 8 method on Day 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9, respectively, and the changes in cell proliferation were analyzed. Result: The cell proliferation rates in experimental groups were higher than that in the control group, and there were statistical differences. Conclusion: Er:YAG laser irradiation with low energy and short time can promote the proliferation of periodontal ligament fibroblasts. Further {{studies are needed to}} determine whether the success rate of tooth replantation can be improved...|$|R

40|$|We {{focus on}} two solar aspects related to flight dynamics. These are the solar dynamo and {{long-term}} solar activity predictions. The {{nature of the}} solar dynamo is central to solar activity predictions, and these predictions are important for orbital planning of satellites in low earth orbit (LEO). The {{reason is that the}} solar ultraviolet (UV) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectral irradiances inflate the upper atmospheric layers of the Earth, forming the thermosphere and exosphere through which these satellites orbit. Concerning the dynamo, we discuss some recent novel approaches towards its understanding. For solar predictions we concentrate on a solar precursor method, in which the <b>Sun</b> <b>s</b> polar field {{plays a major role in}} forecasting the next cycle s activity based upon the Babcock- Leighton dynamo. With a current low value for the <b>Sun</b> <b>s</b> polar field, this method predicts that solar cycle # 24 will be one of the lowest in recent times, with smoothed F 10. 7 radio flux values peaking near 130 + 30 (2 4, in the 2013 timeframe. One may have to consider solar activity as far back as the early 20 th century to find a cycle of comparable magnitude. Concomitant effects of low solar activity upon satellites in LEO will need to be considered, such as enhancements in orbital debris. Support for our prediction of a low solar cycle # 24 is borne out by the lack of new cycle sunspots at least through the first half of 2007. Usually at the present epoch in the solar cycle (- 7 + years after the last solar maximum), for a normal size following cycle, new cycle sunspots would be seen. The lack of their appearance at this time is only consistent with a low cycle # 24. Polar field observations of a weak magnitude are consistent with unusual structures seen in the <b>Sun</b> <b>s</b> corona. Polar coronal holes are the hallmarks of the <b>Sun</b> <b>s</b> open field structures. At present, it appears that the polar coronal holes are relatively weak, and there have been many equatorial coronal holes. This appears consistent with a weakening polar field, but coronal hole data must be scrutinized carefully as observing techniques have changed. We also discuss new solar dynamo ideas, and the SODA (Solar Dynamo Amplitude) index, which provides the user with the ability to track the <b>Sun</b> <b>s</b> hidden, dynamo magnetic fields throughout the various stages of the <b>Sun</b> <b>s</b> cycle. Our solar dynamo ideas are a modernization and rejuvenation of the Babcock-Leighton original idea of a shallow solar dynamo, using modem observations that appear to support their shallow dynamo viewpoint. We are in awe of being able to see an object the size of the Sun undergoing as dramatic a change as our model provides in a few short years. The Sun, however, has undergone changes as rapid as this before! The weather on the Sun is at least as fickle as the weather on the Earth...|$|R

40|$|Large scale flows {{within the}} solar {{convection}} zone {{are the primary}} drivers of the <b>Sun</b> <b>s</b> magnetic activity cycle. Differential rotation can amplify the magnetic field and convert poloidal fields into toroidal fields. Poleward meridional flow near the surface can carry magnetic flux that reverses the magnetic poles and can convert toroidal fields into poloidal fields. The deeper, equatorward meridional flow can carry magnetic flux toward the equator where it can reconnect with oppositely directed fields in the other hemisphere. These axisymmetric flows are themselves driven by large scale convective motions. The effects of the <b>Sun</b> <b>s</b> rotation on convection produce velocity correlations that can maintain the differential rotation and meridional circulation.

40|$|The "Solar Dynamo" {{method of}} solar {{activity}} forecasting is reviewed. Known generically as a 'precursor" method, {{insofar as it}} uses observations which precede solar activity generation, this method now uses the Solar Dynamo Amplitude (SODA) Index to estimate future long-term solar activity. The peak amplitude of the next solar cycle (# 24), is estimated at roughly 124 in terms of smoothed F 10. 7 Radio Flux and 74 {{in terms of the}} older, more traditional smoothed international or Zurich Sunspot number (Ri or Rz). These values are significantly smaller than the amplitudes of recent solar cycles. Levels of activity stay large for about four years near the peak in smoothed activity, which is estimated to occur near the 2012 timeflame. Confidence is added to the prediction of low activity by numerous examinations of the <b>Sun</b> <b>s</b> weakened polar field. Direct measurements are obtained by the Mount Wilson Solar Observatory and the Wilcox Solar Observatory. Further support is obtained by examining the <b>Sun</b> <b>s</b> polar faculae (bright features), the shape of coronal soft X-ray "holes," and the shape of the "source surface" - a calculated coronal feature which maps the large scale structure of the <b>Sun</b> <b>s</b> field. These features do not show the characteristics of well-formed polar coronal holes associated with typical solar minima. They show stunted polar field levels, which are thought to result in stunted levels of solar activity during solar cycle # 24. The reduced levels of solar activity would have concomitant effects upon the space environment in which satellites orbit. In particular, the largest influences would affect orbit determination of satellites in LEO (Low Earth Orbit), based upon the altered thermospheric and exospheric densities. A decrease in solar activity would result in smaller satellite decay rates, as well as fewer large solar events that can destroy satellite electronic functions. Other effects of reduced solar activity upon the space environment include enhanced galactic cosmic rays and more space debris at low altitudes (from the decay of old satellite parts, etc.). The reasons are well known: namely, solar activity serves to sweep the inner heliosphere of galactic cosmic rays, and lower exospheric densities result in decreased drag on LEO debris, allowing longer lifetimes...|$|R
