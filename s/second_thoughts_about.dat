40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a Bayesian {{approach}} to model double bounded contingent valuation data. The double bounded elicitation method is interpreted as a two tier iterated process in which the subject is allowed to have a <b>second</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> his/her valuation for the environmental good. Prior information is modelled from the answers to the first dichotomous choice question. The model is Quasi-Bayesian (Q-B) in that the prior distribution refers to mean willingness to pay while the likelihood function refers to the proportions of a multinomial distribution. This model is applied to empirical data from a contingent valuation survey involving the valuation expressed by European tourists for access to natural areas in the Canary Islands. Results show that point estimate of consumer surplus computed with the Q-B model does not differ substantially from single bounded model estimation. In addition, double bounded seems to be quite robust to the choice of the prior model of willingness to pay responses. Comparison with open ended suggests that the Q-B model might be useful to control for strategic response and starting point biases.

The relationship remains non-committal until 1983, when another man competes for Mavis's hand, the artistic Victor Pendlebury (Christopher Coll).

Satellite communications being activities that intrinsically have a global outreach, mutatis mutandis they require legal rules that would not focus on purely regional or local interests. National and international space law have for the past decade encountered criticism with respect to obvious insufficiencies that in turn affected space activities. The first reaction of learned space lawyers was to call for some redrafting of international space law. A <b>second</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> it had them take into account national legislation in this possible harmonization process, but in any case this was to primarily be of concern for States.

40|$|Background: Psychiatrists {{are indeed}} measurers and thinkers, {{but they are}} first and {{foremost}} people—and they make the same fundamental error that everyone does. That mistake, {{a function of the}} way the brain works, is to think about things and concrete entities rather than looking in the gaps between these things and entities. Here, we attempt to sort out this problem. Objectives: This keynote address aims to explicate a new science of gaps. Gaps are weightless, colourless and odourless—something you rarely recognise, and don’t give a <b>second</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> when you do. And yet they structure your life, your relationships, your beliefs, and the universe. There are far more gaps than things, and far more gaps between ideas, and concepts, than we ever imagine. Methods: We will look through world history, examining some of the great minds who were gap-thinkers. We will see what we can learn from these intellectual leaders, and look to whether we, too, can become accomplished gap-thinkers. Findings: Looking at gaps where others don’t represents a novel and rewarding {{way of looking at the}} world. I hope we will find that such an approach, on detailed inspection, is useful for Congress participants. Conclusions: Welcome to the world of gaps. Becoming a gap-thinker requires a little bit of effort, but, more importantly, a willingness to take a new slant on what is already seen, naturally, because of our hard-wired cognitive architecture. But it might be exceedingly rewarding to make the transition. 2 page(s...|$|R

40|$|New Historicism {{provides}} a critical {{method of interpretation}} of a literary work of art, which came into being as a reaction against New Criticism just as New Criticism came into being as a reaction against historical and biographical methods of literary criticism. The new critics consider a literary text as an autonomous entity. They are suspicious of history and consider the discipline as enemy of literature. The new historicists like its British counterpart cultural materialists, reject the new critical precept. They see literature and history {{as a part of}} dynamic exchange. New Historicism {{is based on the assumption}} that a literary work is the product of the time, place, and circumstances of its composition. The new historicists, therefore, reject the autonomy of both an artist and work of art and argue that literary texts cannot be read and understood in isolation. They emphasize that literary texts must be read and interpreted in its biographical, social and historical contexts. New Historicism as a pedagogical tool for the purpose of understanding and interpreting literary work which took shape in late 1970 s and the early 1980 s, especially in the study of English Renaissance Texts.

40|$|We {{are living}} in a {{multicultural}} society where people from other countries and other cultures are coming to Sweden, including children. Regardless of reasons why these students have come to Sweden, it is common that they are newly arrived and have to learn a second language, in this case Swedish. This will be a challenge, opportunities and difficulties for the student, students’ families and for the school and their staff. The purpose of this essay has been to illumine the teaching methods, models and what materials are used by teachers today to contribute to the best possible second language learning for newly arrived students. In this essay the focus has been on one theory and several model-based approaches. I have used qualitative methods where I did both observations and interviews. The observations took place in six different teaching opportunities in two different schools and classes. The interviews were done by two teachers in two different schools. The result showed that teachers were more inventive compared to the theory. The teachers chose to produce their own material often instead of using ready material, which meant that they could adapt the material to match the students’ level in the class. The result also showed that the Southern school was working with an intercultural approach and was active with the students’ teachers for the mother language compared with the Northern school. In both schools the teachers was working with the perspective of newly arrived pupils with Swedish as second language and that its newly arrived students often have different cultures and experiences which are essential. During my essay I found a disadvantage within these two schools, that preparatory classes were not integrated {{with the rest of the}} school.
