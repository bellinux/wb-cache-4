25|$|The {{original}} deck of {{the bridge}} was built at the lowest possible cost due to Civil War inflation, but the stone towers were designed to carry a much heavier load than was originally demanded. In 1896, the bridge received {{a second set of}} main cables, a wider <b>steel</b> <b>deck,</b> and a longer northern approach. The reconstruction significantly altered the appearance of the bridge, but the new 30-ton weight limit extended its usefulness through the 20th century and beyond. In 1976, in honor of America's bicentennial, the bridge was painted blue (rather than brown).|$|E
25|$|Despite {{its modern}} conveniences, one problem on Pentowna was vibration. One account even {{says that it}} was so bad that ketchup from {{uncapped}} bottles would shoot up from the table in the small dining room. Because of these deficiencies and because new highways and modes of transportation meant fewer passengers, Pentowna was converted into a cargo tug in 1937. The job was given to North Vancouver Shipyards Ltd., who installed a new <b>steel</b> <b>deck</b> and towing machinery and stripped off Pentowna's upper structures. The galley was moved to the top deck and the life boats were raised. After a two-month layover, Pentowna went back into service as a freight ship.|$|E
30|$|The {{composite}} action between the <b>steel</b> <b>decking</b> and the hardened concrete {{is dependent on}} the transmission of horizontal shear stresses acting on the interface between the concrete slab and the <b>steel</b> <b>decking</b> (Abdullah and Easterling 2009; Bradford 2010; Ferrer et al. 2006; Gholamhoseini et al. 2014 a). Composite action and the transmission of horizontal shear stresses at the concrete–steel interface are necessary for the <b>steel</b> <b>decking</b> to perform its role as the tension reinforcement for the system. The {{composite action}} between the concrete and the <b>steel</b> <b>decking</b> is achieved, not only by chemical bonding between the decking and the concrete, but also by mechanical interlock between the concrete and the embossments on the profiled <b>steel</b> <b>decking.</b> Further composite action can be attained by attaching shear studs or similar shear devices.|$|R
30|$|Each slab was 6900  mm long, with a cross section  150  mm {{deep and}} 1200  mm wide, and {{contained}} no bottom reinforcement (other than the external <b>steel</b> <b>decking).</b> The decking was formed from 0.75  mm thick grade G 500 steel with a Z 275 coating produced according to (Standards Australia 2011). The composite slabs were cast with the profiled <b>steel</b> <b>decking</b> as permanent formwork and the concrete was then cured for 7  days under wet hessian. For each specimen, the <b>steel</b> <b>decking</b> was completely {{supported on the}} laboratory floor during casting of the concrete to minimise initial stress or deformation in the <b>steel</b> <b>decking</b> and the deck was cleaned thoroughly before placing concrete.|$|R

25|$|Production of the {{suspension}} cables {{was done by}} Thyssen of Germany, while the vertical suspenders were built by Bridon Ropes in England. The 24 <b>steel</b> <b>deck</b> boxes were built by Kværner Eureka in Moss. The first wire of {{the suspension}} cable was placed between the pylons on 1 July 1991. The three auxiliary roads on Askøy were completed by December 1991. Work was ahead of schedule, and the planned opening date was on 1 April 1992 moved from May 1993 to 12 December 1992. The last deck section was lifted in place on 4 April 1992. The first tube of the Damsgård Tunnel opened on 10 December, while the second was scheduled for 1 May 1993. West-bound traffic along National Road 555 was in the mean time routes via Laksevåg. Only one tube of the Lyderhorn Tunnel was open, but it instead had one lane in each direction.|$|E

30|$|Composite one-way {{concrete}} slabs with profiled <b>steel</b> <b>decking</b> as permanent formwork {{are commonly used}} in the construction industry. The <b>steel</b> <b>decking</b> supports the wet concrete of a cast in situ reinforced or post-tensioned concrete slab and, after the concrete sets, acts as external reinforcement. In this type of slab, longitudinal shear failure between the concrete and the <b>steel</b> <b>decking</b> {{is the most common}} type of failure at the ultimate load stage. Design codes require the experimental evaluation of the ultimate load capacity and longitudinal shear strength of each type of <b>steel</b> <b>decking</b> using full-scale tests on simple-span slabs. There is also no procedure in current design codes to evaluate the ultimate load capacity and longitudinal shear strength of continuous composite slabs and this is often assessed experimentally by full-scale tests. This paper presents the results of three full-scale tests up to failure on continuous composite {{concrete slabs}} cast with trapezoidal <b>steel</b> <b>decking</b> profile (KF 70) that is widely used in Australia. Slab specimens were tested in four-point bending at each span with shear spans of span/ 4. The longitudinal shear failure of each slab is evaluated and the measured mid-span deflection, the end slip and the mid-span steel and concrete strains are also presented and discussed. Redistribution of bending moment in each slab is presented and discussed. A finite element model is proposed and verified by experimental data using interface element to model the bond properties between <b>steel</b> <b>decking</b> and concrete slab and investigate the ultimate strength of continuous composite concrete slabs.|$|R
30|$|The {{complete}} stress–strain curve, {{elastic modulus}} Es and yield stress fyp of the <b>steel</b> <b>decking</b> were also measured from tests on three coupons {{cut from the}} sheet of decking.

Similarly, from tests on three samples of the reinforcing bars, the average values were fy =  495  MPa and Es =  205  GPa, respectively.|$|R
30|$|In {{the partial}} shear {{connection}} method, the flexural {{capacity of the}} composite slab at full shear connection stage is calculated by simple plastic analysis of the section and by employing rectangular stress blocks for the concrete and profiled <b>steel</b> <b>decking.</b> Due to interface slip occurrence, to evaluate the ultimate longitudinal shear stress between <b>steel</b> <b>decking</b> and concrete slab, full-scale tests are also required in this method to determine the degree of shear connection.|$|R

50|$|The {{bridge is}} usually built on falsework.

40|$|Orthotropic <b>steel</b> <b>decks,</b> {{directly}} {{subjected to}} traffic loads in road bridges, {{are very sensitive}} to fatigue: in most cases, fatigue defects appear as fatigue cracks, which affect top plates, longitudinal ribs and cross-beams of the deck. The main causes of fatigue in <b>steel</b> <b>decks</b> are inappropriate structural details adopted, welding defects included at the time of fabrication, unforeseen stresses and deformations at the joints. The case study examined in this paper regards an Italian highway bridge, built in 1992, and located on the "Milan- Venice" A 4 highway. It has an orthotropic steel structure, composed by two separated box girder decks with three spans, for a total length of 152 m, the central one being 70 m long. The trapezoidal steel boxes have a constant height, about 3. 50 m. Recent inspections revealed that the deck is affected by a diffuse cracking in the top plate and longitudinal ribs.

500|$|Located at {{the north-south}} and east-west roadway {{section of the}} {{riverside}} town of Cornwall, Connecticut, numerous bridges have been built at this location. As early as 1762, a bridge {{may have been in}} service here. The lifespan of these bridges was not a long term one, for floods and ice would demolish them frequently. Peter Vermilyea, author of Hidden History of Litchfield County, states that wooden bridges had typical life spans of seven to ten years. Town records list expenditures for repair and placement. For many decades the current West Cornwall bridge was believed to have been constructed in 1841, as a replacement for an earlier bridge that washed away in the flood of 1837. The 1841 date was even included on the National Register of Historic Places nomination and was claimed to have been supervised by Ithiel Town himself. At least one, but possibly several incarnations of these earlier bridges were known as the Hart Bridge, after a settler of West Cornwall. Local tradition states that Selectman Marcus Smith traveled to North Adams, Massachusetts to choose the timber for the bridge. The 1841 bridge may have been overseen by Ithiel Town, but the current bridge dates to about 1864 according to research by Michael R. Gannett for the Cornwall Historical Society. The center pier which supports of the middle bridge was likely reused from the previous bridge. In 1968, the State of Connecticut added the bridge to the state system and considered replacing it. A local committee in West Cornwall was created and organized to save the covered bridge, through their efforts the Connecticut Department of Transportation decided to renovate the bridge. The bridge was raised up an additional two feet and steel supports were inserted to support the roadway. [...] In 1973, the roadway was reinforced {{with the addition of a}} concealed <b>steel</b> <b>deck</b> to support the weight of traffic.
