5000|$|A penalty {{paid for}} the {{efficiency}} of suspension preheaters is their tendency to block up. Salts, such as the sulfate and chloride of sodium and potassium, tend to evaporate in the burning zone of the kiln. They are carried back in vapor form, and re-condense when a sufficiently low temperature is encountered. Because these salts re-circulate back into the rawmix and re-enter the burning zone, a recirculation cycle establishes itself. A kiln with 0.1% chloride in the rawmix and clinker may have 5% chloride in the mid-kiln material. Condensation usually occurs in the preheater, and a <b>sticky</b> <b>deposit</b> of liquid salts glues dusty rawmix into a hard deposit, typically on surfaces against which the gas-flow is impacting. This can choke the preheater {{to the point that}} air-flow can no longer be maintained in the kiln. It then becomes necessary to manually break the build-up away. Modern installations often have automatic devices installed at vulnerable points to knock out build-up regularly. An alternative approach is to [...] "bleed off" [...] some of the kiln exhaust at the kiln inlet where the salts are still in the vapor phase, and remove and discard the solids in this. This is usually termed an [...] "alkali bleed" [...] and it breaks the recirculation cycle. It can also be of advantage for cement quality reasons, since it reduces the alkali content of the clinker. However, hot gas is run to waste so the process is inefficient and increases kiln fuel consumption.|$|E

40|$|The use {{of brown}} coal can cause severe {{problems}} in combustion systems {{as far as}} fouling and slagging are concerned. Especially alkali metals that are released during combustion {{are responsible for the}} formation of <b>sticky</b> <b>deposits</b> in the boiler. In order to tackle this problem, an increased understanding of the combustion chemistry of brown coal is necessary. For this reason, laboratory combustion experiments with seven different German brown coals from the Rheinland area were conducted at temperatures of 800 and 1200 degrees C. High pressure mass spectrometry was used for the on-line analysis of the combustion products such as HC 1, NaCl, KCl, SO 2 and Na 2 SO 4. The results show that the release of HCl, NaCl and KCI is strongly dependent on the Cl-content of the coals. Furthermore, at temperatures of 1200 degrees C, NaCl and SO 2 were released in two steps, whereas at 800 degrees C these species were released in one step only. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Prey up to the size of a small rabbit would probably have been swallowed more or less whole, while carrion would have been fed on {{in a manner similar}} to that of condors or vultures. The large number of finds in the La Brea Tar Pits were usually considered to be from teratorns which were attracted by Pleistocene megafauna that became stuck and died in the viscous asphalt while trying to drink from pools of water that gathered on the surface, with the teratorns subsequently falling victim to the <b>sticky</b> <b>deposits</b> too. Merriam's Teratorn probably played an important role in opening up the body cavities of carcasses for smaller birds like eagles and ravens which are also known to have frequented the locality, as mammalian predators, being unable to fly, could hardly reach most carcasses without getting mired in the asphalt themselves.|$|R

METHODS: Validated translated {{versions of the}} Hiroshima University-Dental Behavioural Inventory (HU-DBI) questionnaire were administered to 1, 096 final-year dental students in 17 countries. Hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted within the data to detect patterns and groupings. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 72 %. The cluster analysis identified two main groups among the countries. Group 1 consisted of twelve countries: one Oceanic (Australia), one Middle-Eastern (Israel), seven European (Northern Ireland, England, Finland, Greece, Germany, Italy, and France) and three Asian (Korea, Thailand and Malaysia) countries. Group 2 consisted of five countries: one South American (Brazil), one European (Belgium) and three Asian (China, Indonesia and Japan) countries. The percentages of 'agree' responses in three HU-DBI questionnaire items were significantly higher in Group 2 than in Group 1. They include: "I worry about the colour of my teeth.

40|$|Formation of {{pitch and}} <b>sticky</b> <b>deposits</b> through the destabilisation of {{colloidal}} material present in paper manufacture {{continues to be}} a challenge in improving machine efficiency in newsprint manufacture from a furnish comprising thermo-mechanical pulp (TMP) and recycled fibre (RCF), and in an environment where water usage efficiency is at best practice. Findings from laboratory studies that have investigated colloid structure, impact of multiple and multi-valent cations, pH, temperature, shear and dissolved organic matter on Pinus radiata extractive colloid stability have been used, along with observations of process conditions in Norske Skog’s Albury mill to determine which properties are most important in maintaining colloid stability. Developments in our understanding of wood extractive colloid structure have led to an explanation as to why pitch deposition is more likely during summer months. A parameter called the “ester to acid ratio” has been shown to exhibit both short and long-term trends when applied to process stream extractive levels. This greater propensity for deposition during summer months is exacerbated by elevated soluble calcium levels during summer time. Dissolved organic wood polymers also affect colloid stability and their behaviour is further modified by the presence of soluble calcium. More stable colloids are obtained under conditions of neutral pH, avoidance of downward temperature shocks and avoidance of shear forces...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{trends in}} {{papermaking}} like closed water systems or higher use of recovered paper as raw material, {{a large number}} of contaminants are accumulated in the system as dissolved and colloidal material (DCM). When the DCM is destabilized by a sudden change in the system conditions, it produces <b>sticky</b> <b>deposits</b> called secondary <b>stickies</b> that affect the papermaking processes {{and the quality of the}} final product. The laboratory methods existing to predict DCM destabilisation have limitations as low reproducibility or they do not distinguish between sticky and non-sticky materials and/or high volumes are necessary to perform the test, etc. In order to solve these problems, a methodology to predict the depositability potential of DCM has been developed by the Complutense University of Madrid. The methodology is based, first, on the destabilisation of the DCM by polymer addition, second, on its deposition on the collector surfaces and, third, on the quantification of the formed deposits by image analysis. Results show that the methodology has a good reproducibility with an error below 10 %. Validation was carried out by application of the method to different cases.

MethodsThe English-language version of the 20 -item HU-DBI was distributed to all preclinical and clinical students at the College of Dentistry, University of Dammam, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Dichotomized (agree/disagree) responses to 12 HU-DBI items were used in this study, with a maximum possible score of 12. Responses to the remaining eight statements reflected general oral health attitudes and {{were excluded from the}} analysis. Data were analyzed statistically. ResultsThe overall response rate was 72. 2 % (preclinical, 72. 5 %; clinical, 72 %). The mean HU-DBI score was significantly higher among clinical than among preclinical dental students (7 vs. 5. 8; P< 0. 05). Higher proportions of preclinical than clinical students did not worry about visiting the dentist but postponed dental visits until they experienced toothache. Furthermore, more preclinical than clinical students reported that their gums bled upon brushing, used a child-sized toothbrush, had observed white, <b>sticky</b> <b>deposits</b> on their teeth, and used strong strokes for toothbrushing. More clinical than preclinical students reported that they did not feel that the condition of their teeth was worsening despite brushing, worried about the color of their teeth, brushed each of their teeth carefully, and checked their teeth in the mirror after brushing. ConclusionsDental health awareness programs should be implemented and information about positive oral health attitudes should be provided to the students at an initial stage of dental training...|$|R

30|$|In recent years, {{many new}} APMP and P-RC APMP lines (preconditioning {{followed}} by refiner chemical treatment alkaline peroxide mechanical pulping lines) have been installed in China, {{and a large}} amount of APMP effluent has been produced. Although the yield of pulp is 90  %, which still has about 10  % organic and inorganic matters dissolved in the effluent and a small amounts of them is adsorbed on the pulp [1]. In previous studies, researchers have paid more attention to their negative impact on the pulp and paper mill process, which may cause production and environmental problems in the pulp and paper industry. In the pulping process, these organic matters, especially wood extractives and lignin degradation products, are difficult to remove in the washing stages and may lead to <b>sticky</b> <b>deposits</b> on process equipment. The accumulation of small amounts of these substances can result in blockages, which are responsible for reduced production levels, higher equipment maintenance costs, higher operational cost, and increased incidence of quality defects [2]. Once, these extractives or lignin enter into wet end together with the pulp, most of which are in the form of colloidal and dissolved particles [3]. Only fatty and resin acids and sterols are found in dissolved form in these waters [4]. In colloidal resin particles, steryl esters and triglycerides, which are the most hydrophobic components of the extractives, form the hydrophobic core while fatty and resin acids and sterols form the thin surface layer of the particles. The carboxyl groups of fatty and resin acids are orientated toward the aqueous phase [5 – 8]. The particles are negatively charged in the pH 2 – 11. Carboxyl and hydroxyl groups on the surface of colloidal resin particles stabilized them electrostatically, while hemicelluloses especially mannans stabilize them sterically. In wet end, {{with a high degree of}} white-water system closure, these organic matters can have a negative impact on paper machine runnability and product quality. Problems and distances such as pitch depositions on the paper, specks in the paper, decreased wet strength, interference with cationic process chemicals, and impaired sheet brightness and paper strength are often caused.|$|R

40|$|Pulp from {{recycled}} paper products contains various waxes, glues, adhesives, filler, and inorganics that are collectively {{referred to as}} contaminants. Contaminants that are not drained out during the forming process are trapped in the sheet and carried down the paper machine. These contaminant particles and contaminants in solution can become deposited on the dryer cylinders. The contaminants which deposit on the dryer cylinders lead to reduced quality and production of paper on the machine. The process by which contaminants are deposited on a dryer cylinder has not been explored at a fundamental level. Rather, quick industrial fixes have been tested to try and eliminate the contaminant deposition and only reductions in deposition have been achieved. The literature reviewed does not relate the flow of particle suspensions through porous media to the heat transfer and fluid dynamics processes associated with drying paper. The experiments in the literature showed the general trends of particle and dye distributions across the thicknesses of different porous media during forming or filtration processes. Filler and fines distribution {{were not able to}} be changed by flows induced by pressing a sheet. The mechanisms for how particles move through porous media found in the literature were a basis for what kind of phenomena would be expected in the particle flow experiments. A means of completely eliminating <b>sticky</b> <b>deposits</b> could be found by examining the parameters which contribute to the deposition process. The hypothesis proposed in this thesis is that contaminant particles and liquid containing contaminants are transported to the dryer can surface by liquid flows induced by the drying process. By performing particle flow experiments during drying, bounds for the particle size, initial drying surface temperature, drying time, and initial solids content will be determined for which the hypothesis is true. The particle and dye transport studies performed showed an array of processes at work simultaneously. The results from the particle and dye transport studies show that a particle diameter of ~ 1. 0 and # 956;m or less, handsheet solids content of less than 30 %, open sheet structure and a high surface drying temperature (200 C) were needed to create a significant change in filler and dye distribution across the thickness of a handsheet.

When these ants are in close proximity, the bees produce and <b>deposit</b> <b>sticky</b> barriers to obstruct their path.

40|$|We {{consider}} the business strategy of some banks that provide relationship loans (where they have loan origination and monitoring advantages relative to capital markets) with core deposit funding (where they can pass along {{the benefit of}} a <b>sticky</b> price on <b>deposits).</b> These "traditional banks" tend to lend out less than the deposits they take in, so they have a "buffer stock" of core deposits. This buffer stock of core deposits can be used to mitigate the full effect of tighter monetary policy on their bank-dependent borrowers. In this manner, the business strategy of "traditional banks" acts as a "core deposit mitigation channel" to provide funds to bank-dependent borrowers when there are monetary shocks. In effect, there is no bank lending channel of monetary policy associated with these traditional banks.; In contrast, other banks mainly rely on managed liabilities that are priced at market rates. These banks do not have to shift from insured deposits to managed liabilities in response to tighter monetary policy. At the margin, their loans are already funded with managed liabilities. For these banks as well, there is no unique bank lending channel of monetary policy.; The only banks that are likely to raise loan rates substantially in response to an increase in the federal funds rate are banks with a high proportion of relationship loans that are close to a loan-to-core deposit ratio of one. These banks must substitute higher cost nondeposit liabilities, which have an external finance premium, for core deposits, which do not because of deposit insurance. Some of these banks may also face higher marginal costs as their loan-to-core deposit ratio approaches one because of the costs associated with lending to default-prone relationship borrowers. It is among these banks (which we refer to as high relationship lenders), and only these banks, that we find evidence of a bank lending channel - they significantly reduce lending in response to a monetary contraction. Importantly, these banks hold {{only a small fraction of}} U. S. banking assets. Thus, in the United States, the bank lending channel seems limited in scope and importance, mainly because so few banks that specialize in relationship lending switch from core deposits to managed liabilities in response to changes in interest rates.

40|$|In recent years, {{the world}} has {{expressed}} an increasing interest in the recycling of waste paper to supplement the use of virgin fiber {{as a way to}} protect the environment. Statistics show that major countries are increasing their use of recycled paper. For example, in 1991 to 1996, the U. S. increased its recovered paper utilization rate from 31 % to 39 %, Germany went from 50 % to 60 %, the UK went from 60 % to 70 %, France increased from 46 % to 49 %, and China went from 32 % to 35 % [1]. As recycled fiber levels and water system closures both increase, recycled product quality will need to improve in order for recycled products to compete with products made from virgin fiber [2]. The use of recycled fiber has introduced an increasing level of metal, plastic, and adhesive contamination into the papermaking process which has added to the complexity of the already overwhelming task of providing a uniform and clean recycle furnish. The most harmful of these contaminates is a mixture of adhesives and polymeric substances that are commonly known as stickies. Stickies, which enter the mill with the pulp furnish, are not easily removed from the repulper and become more difficult the further down the system they get. This can be detrimental to the final product quality. Stickies are hydrophobic, tacky, polymeric materials that are introduced into the papermaking system from a mixture of recycled fiber sources. Properties of stickies are very similar to the fibers used in papermaking, viz. size, density, hydrophobicity, and electrokinetic charge. This reduces the probability of their removal by conventional separation processes, such as screening and cleaning, which are based on such properties. Also, their physical and chemical structure allows for them to extrude through screens, attach to fibers, process equipment, wires and felts. Stickies can break down and then reagglomerate and appear at seemingly any place in the mill. When subjected to a number of factors including changes in pH, temperature, concentration, charge, and shear forces, <b>stickies</b> can <b>deposit</b> [3]. These deposits can lead to decreased runnability, productivity and expensive downtime. If the stickie remains in the stock, then machine breaks can be common. Finally, if the stickie is not removed or deposited, it will either leave in the final product causing converting and printing problems or recirculate within the mill. It has been estimated that stickies cost the paper industry between $ 600 and $ 700 million a year due to the cost of control methods and lost production attributed to stickies [3]. Also, of the seven recycling mills opened in the United States between 1994 and 1997, four have closed citing stickies as the main reason responsible for the closure [4]. Adhesives are widely used throughout the paper and paperboard industry and are subsequently found in the recycled pulp furnish. Hodgson stated that even the best stock preparation process can only remove 99 % of the contaminants, of which the remaining 1 % is usually adhesives of various types which are usually 10 - 150 microns in effective diameter [5]. The large particles are removed by mechanical means such as cleaners and screens, and the smaller, colloidal particles can be removed with washing. The stickies that pass through the cleaning and screening processes cause 95 % of the problems associated with recycling [6]. The cleaners will remove most of the stickies that have a density varying from the pulp slurry ({approx} 1. 0 g/cm 3) and will accept stickies with densities ranging from 0. 95 - 1. 05 g/cm 3 [2]. The hydrophobicity of the material is also an important characteristic of the stickie [7]. The hydrophobicity causes the stickies to agglomerate with other hydrophobic materials such as other stickies, lignin, and even pitch. The tacky and viscous nature of stickies contributes to many product and process problems, negatively affecting the practicality of recycled fiber use. The source of stickies that evade conventional removal techniques are usually synthetic polymers, including acrylates, styrene butadiene rubber, vinyl acetates, and polypropylene [5, 6, 8 - 12]. Sources of these adhesives are usually broken down into categories based on application...|$|R
