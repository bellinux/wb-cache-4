40|$|There {{are very}} rich archival {{materials}} in our country, but unfortunately these sources {{have not been}} collected, preserved, classified and presented for use properly. One {{of the main reasons}} for this is that the lack of statutory regulations that would solve the problems and bring order to the state archives. For a full and better archival services one of the first necessary conditions is the legislations. From {{the early years of the}} Republican period different statutory regulations have been prepared in order to organize the management and put the services in an order, and also to provide the necessary conditions and trained staff for the public archives. Many legislations made until 1984 have been abolished due to their ineffective usage. Today, two legislations and one regulation meet the needs of the state archives. These <b>statutory</b> <b>legislations</b> require state archives to discharge many responsibilities. The aim of this study is to investigate the conditions of the archives of the state institutions and to identify the problems, and thus offer some solutions to these problems within the limitations of the existing legislations...|$|R

In contrast, regulations have been altered on numerous occasions in the twentieth century. The paper also shows that the regulatory process has been the result of the interplay between economic as well as political economy forces.

40|$|This paper {{examined}} the unserviceable assets disposal practices of five (5) Polytechnics(tertiary educational institutions) in Ghana. The {{aim was to}} determine the extent of statutory compliance, and the degree to which value for money (VfM) was achieved in actual disposals. A survey was conducted using interviewer administered questionnaires containing five point Likert scale test items. Descriptive statistics and a one-way ANOVA were employed to analyse the data. The study results showed that a limited number of Polytechnics had internal policies to operationalise the <b>statutory</b> procurement <b>legislation.</b> Top management demonstrated very clear understanding of the procurement law while senior level managers displayed mixed levels of understanding. The section of the law dealing with disposals and the procedures thereto is perceived to be difficult to implement and does not promote Value for Money. Top management’s interference in auctions was the toughest challenge in the process, while public auction was the predominant method used in assets disposal...|$|R
