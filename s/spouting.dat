5|$|Flamethrower, {{double piston}} and gunpowder-activated: Although the single piston {{flamethrower}} was first {{developed in the}} Byzantine Empire during the 7th century, the 10th-century Chinese flamethrower, or Pen Huo Qi, boasted a continuous stream of flame by employing double piston syringes (which had been known since the Han Dynasty) <b>spouting</b> Greek fire which had been imported from China's maritime trade contacts in the Middle East. It was first used in battle 932 during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (907–960), and the earliest illustration {{is found in the}} early Song Dynasty military manuscript Wujing Zongyao of 1044, which also described the device in full. Unlike the Greek model which employed a furnace, the Pen Huo Qi was ignited by an incendiary gunpowder fuse.|$|E
5|$|Hadji Ali (c.1887–92– November5, 1937) was a {{vaudeville}} performance artist, {{thought to}} be of Egyptian descent, who was famous for acts of controlled regurgitation. His best-known feats included water <b>spouting,</b> smoke swallowing, and nut and handkerchief swallowing followed by disgorgement in an order chosen by the audience. Ali's most famous stunt, and the highlight of his act, was drinking copious amounts of water followed by kerosene, and then acting by turns as a human flamethrower and fire extinguisher as he expelled the two liquids onto a theatrical prop. While these stunts were performed, a panel of audience members was invited to watch the show up close to verify that no trickery was employed.|$|E
5|$|Mechanical theater (driven by {{carriage}} wheels): The inventors of {{the field}} mill mentioned above, Xie Fei and Wei Mengbian of the Later Zhao (319–351 AD), also invented an intricate mechanical theater mounted on a carriage, its figures operated by motive power (i.e. simply advancing the carriage forward). From 335 to 345 AD, they worked at the court of the ethnic-Jie emperor Shi Hu (334–349). The vehicle they crafted was a four-wheeled and 6m (20ft) long carriage that was about 3m (10ft) wide. On it rested a large golden Buddha statue with a Daoist statue continually rubbing his front with his mechanical hand. The Buddha was also surrounded by ten wooden Daoists who rotated around him in a circuit, periodically bowing to him, saluting him, and throwing incense into a censer. Above the Buddha were nine dragon-headed faucets which spouted water. Like the field mill and the pounding cart of these two inventors, when the carriage halted, so did all of its moving components of mechanical statues and <b>spouting</b> faucets.|$|E
40|$|The dynamic {{characteristics}} of gas-particle <b>spout</b> fluidized {{bed in a}} pulsed <b>spouted</b> microwave-vacuum drying system (PSMVD) were investigated. The <b>spout</b> fluidization process in a pseudo- 2 -D <b>spout</b> fluidized bed was simulated by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) using the inviscid two-fluid theory method (TFM) based on the kinetic theory of granular flow. The {{dynamic characteristics}} of the <b>spout</b> fluidized bed {{and the effect of}} <b>spout</b> elevation on the particle movement were revealed, which could be used to improve the uniformity of particle mixing and microwave heating. The mathematical model demonstrated that the <b>spout</b> fluidization process includes isolated, merged and transitional jets and the fluidization at a specific <b>spout</b> gas velocity has a start-up stage and a quasi-steady fluidization stage. The <b>spout</b> velocity was an important factor controlling particle status in the <b>spout</b> fluidized bed and a critical velocity was identified for effect transition of the flow pattern. There was an approximately linear correlation between the jet penetration depth and the <b>spout</b> velocity. When the <b>spout</b> gas velocity increased up to the critical velocity region, the pressure drop tended to convert from negative pressure to positive pressure...|$|R

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model developed by Nellist et al. (1987) was adopted in this continuous two dimensional <b>spouted</b> bed dryer (2 DSB) configuration. The {{objective of this}} research was to predict air temperature, grain temperature, absolute humidity and moisture content during the drying process in 2 DSB. In simulation, <b>spouted</b> bed was divided into two regions which were <b>spout</b> and downcomer regions. Air and grains in <b>spout</b> and downcomer were assumed to be moving with co- and counterflow principles. During experiments, drying air temperature at 80 oC and different paddy initial moisture contents (at 41 % db, 36 % db and 30 % db) were used. Based on data, the air temperature profiles in <b>spout</b> region showed that air temperature dropped significantly with the axial positions while downcomer regions resulted fluctuated value. The average deviation of the air temperature in the <b>spout</b> was less than 4. 5 % and within downcomer was less than 4. 2 %. Grain temperature and absolute humidity in <b>spout</b> region increased slowly whilst decreasing in steps in downcomer regions with axial position. The moisture content decreased both in <b>spouted</b> and downcomer regions. Moisture reduction in <b>spout</b> region was higher than downcomer regions because of the high air flow rate in <b>spout</b> region...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{presents}} {{the influence of}} geometrical characteristics {{of the system and}} material properties upon the main dynamic parameters of the granular material in <b>spouted</b> bed. It is used inorganically materials with different sizes, shapes and densities. The materials are classified in group D, according with Geldart classification, adequate to the <b>spouted</b> bed processing. The main dynamic parameters studied were: the minimum <b>spouted</b> velocity, the minimum pressure drop, maximum <b>spouted</b> bed height. By experimental data processing it was obtained empirical relationships specific to the studied system. The obtained relations can be used at <b>spouted</b> bed apparatus design...|$|R
40|$|In Experiment 1, rats {{living in}} {{chambers}} containing bedding material were injected with a toxicosis-producing dose of lithium chloride shortly after their initial taste of sweetened condensed milk. They consumed no additional milk {{and used the}} bedding to bury the <b>spout</b> through which the milk had been delivered, although they did not bury a concurrently available water <b>spout.</b> In another control condition, rats did not bury a <b>spout</b> containing a novel solution (saccharin) not paired with toxicosis. In Experiment 2, rats did not bury a milk <b>spout</b> until milk consumption was followed by toxicosis. In Experiment 3, rats buried a <b>spout</b> containing Tabasco pepper sauce but not a concurrently available water <b>spout.</b> Thus, burying the food source {{appears to be an}} integral component of the rat's defensive reaction to noxious food...|$|R
25|$|Angiogenesis also {{contributes}} {{to the complexity of}} the initial network; <b>spouting</b> endothelial buds form by an extrusion-like process which is prompted by the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). These endothelial buds grow away from the parent vessel to form smaller, daughter vessels reaching into new territory. Intussusception, the phenomenon of a single tube splitting to form two branching tubes, {{also contributes}} to angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is generally responsible for colonizing individual organ systems with blood vessels, whereas vasculogenesis lays down the initial pipelines of the network. Angiogenesis is also known to occur during vascular remodelling.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the prime}} {{examples}} of early western architecture was the Rokumeikan, a large two-story building in Tokyo, completed in 1883, which {{was to become a}} controversial symbol of Westernisation in the Meiji period. Commissioned for the housing of foreign guests by the Foreign Minister Inoue Kaoru, it was designed by Josiah Conder, a prominent foreign government advisors in Meiji Japan (o-yatoi gaikokujin). The Ryōunkaku was Japan's first western-style skyscraper, constructed in 1890 in Asakusa. However traditional architecture was still employed for new buildings, such as the Kyūden of Tokyo Imperial Palace, albeit with token western elements such as a <b>spouting</b> water fountain in the gardens.|$|E

One of her hands (the younger added) kept feeling her dress, {{as if trying to}} discover why it was wet. These men took my sixty-six year old mother by the arms and tried to lead her toward a nearby farmhouse; but she threw them off, strode straight to my father's body, and directed a group of scared spectators to cover him.

The interaction between gas and particles was modeled by the Gidaspow drag model. The overall flow behavior within the <b>spouted</b> bed was predicted well by the above model. A stable <b>spouted</b> region, a fountain region, an annular region and typical flow characteristics of <b>spouted</b> bed were correctly predicted using the model. Distribution of particle concentration, particle velocity and pressure obtained can provide important information on the flow field within the <b>spouted</b> bed for process design and scale-up.

25|$|Like {{the largest}} fish today, the whale sharks and basking sharks, Leedsichthys problematicus derived its {{nutrition}} as a suspension feeder, using {{an array of}} specialised gill rakers lining its gill basket to extract zooplankton, small animals, from the water passing through its mouth and across its gills. It is less clear whether also phytoplankton, algae, {{were part of the}} diet. Leedsichthys could have been a ram feeder, making the water pass through its gills by swimming, but could also have actively pumped the water through the gill basket. In 2010, Liston suggested that fossilised furrows discovered in ancient sea floors in Switzerland and attributed to the activity of plesiosaurs, had in fact been made by Leedsichthys <b>spouting</b> water through its mouth to disturb and eat the benthos, the animals dwelling in the sea floor mud.|$|E
25|$|Europa {{has much}} {{indirect}} evidence for its sub-surface ocean. Models of how Europa {{is affected by}} Tidal heating require a subsurface layer of liquid water or warm ice in order to accurately reproduce the linear fracturing of the surface. Indeed, observations by the Galileo spacecraft of how Europa's magnetic field interacts with Jupiter's field strengthens {{the case for a}} liquid, rather than solid, layer; an electrically conductive fluid deep within Europa would explain these results. Observations from the Hubble Space Telescope in December 2012 appear to show an ice plume <b>spouting</b> from Europa's surface, which would immensely strengthen the case for a liquid subsurface ocean. As was the case for Enceladus, vapour geysers would allow for easy sampling of the liquid layer. Unfortunately, there appears to be little evidence that geysering is a frequent event on Europa {{due to the lack of}} water in the space near Europa.|$|E
