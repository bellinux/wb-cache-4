5000|$|Cadenza is a mixed-voice {{chamber choir}} based in Edinburgh, Scotland. The choir {{was formed in}} 1992 and quickly gained a {{reputation}} for a high standard of performance, winning the Scotland and North England heat of the Sainsbury's Choir of the Year competition in both 1996 and 1998. [...] The current musical director is Jenny <b>Summerling.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Summer Hugglemonster (voiced by Hynden Walch) is {{the sister}} of Henry who is over 7 years old. She is pink and she wears red shoes, or {{occasionally}} blue ones. Her hobbies are putting on plays, singing, dancing, writing and composing music and songs and cheerleading. She is flexible enough to do a left front split. She is also called <b>Summerling</b> but it is unclear if this is her full forename or a nickname. In the book, her name was Lola Hugglewug. Her friends include Izzy and Meg.|$|E
40|$|We {{conducted}} a preliminary study {{to evaluate the}} capacity of <b>summerling</b> Astacus astacus to consume the American waterweed (Elodea canadensis Michx.). under artificial rearing conditions. <b>Summerling</b> A. astacus (initial b. w. : 0. 32 ± 0. 02 g) were cultured (50 crayfish/m 2) in 600 l tanks for 89 days. The experimental design was composed of three treatments as follows: control diet (D) (crude protein: 40. 9 % DM; ether extract: 7. 4 % DM), elodea (E) (crude protein: 25. 8 % DM; ether extract: 1. 4 % DM) and control diet + elodea (D + E) with three replicates per treatment. Temperature, dissolved oxygen, and other water parameters were measured weekly (T: 20. 1 °C; O 2 : 7. 2 mg/l; pH: 7. 5; N-NH 4 : 0. 05 mg/l; N-NO 2 : 0. 01 mg/l; N-NO 3 : 29. 9 mg/l). The relative growth rate was significantly (P < 0. 01) higher in treatment D + E (195 %) and D (143 %) than in E (65 %). The reduced growth observed in crayfish fed elodea only can probably {{be due to the}} lower dietary lipid level of the plant respect to the standard crayfish requirements. At the end of the experiment, the survival rate of A. astacus was higher (P < 0. 05) for the treatment D + E (87 %) and D (81 %), compared to E (56 %). Our results suggest that E. canadensis {{can be used as a}} non-expensive supplemental food in order to increase growth and survival in <b>summerling</b> noble crayfish. They also showed that A. astacus has the potential to consume this macrophyte in nature...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{research}} {{has been carried out}} on fanning of the narrow-clawed crayfish larvae in ponds and cages in the TPP waste water. It was shown that farming in such conditions during the first vegetation period was more effective, than in water bodies with natural temperature regime. In ponds in polyculture with fish crayfish <b>summerlings</b> reached 4. 4 - 4. 6 cm length and 2. 69 - 3. 34 g mass; when grown in cages with natural forage resources - 3. 4 - 3. 7 cm and 1. 25 - 1. 53 g, accordingly. Survival rate in the ponds amounted to 2. 9 - 3. 0 %, in cages - 22. 0 - 37. 3 %. Density of seeding should be about 70 specimens/m 2. Cages of the open-air type have been recommended...|$|R
40|$|Lake Bourget (4400 ha), {{located in}} France, {{is a deep}} peri-alpine lake. In {{the middle of the}} XX century, populations of {{whitefish}} (Coregonus lavaretus) with a littoral spawning (< 10 m) and of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) with a deep spawning (40 - 80 m) collapsed in relation with the eutrophication, but without totally disappearing. Important environmental measures provoked reoligotrophication, P dropping from 120 to 25 μg/L between the initial phase and the beginning of final phase of reoligotrophication. A programme of stocking with the two species was undertook by managers, starting {{in the middle of the}} eighteen’s and using local spawners to produce F 1 alevins. Thanks to original large scale marking campaigns of small fishes, the present work evaluates the respective contribution of stocking and natural recruitment in the catches during the reoligotrophication process. Some recapture rates were also evaluated. In the initial phase of reoligotrophication, in the eighteens –beginning of the nineteens the stocking with fed alevins have had a very important contribution (88 - 91 % at the dominant 3 + age) allowing to avoid the disappearance and even permitting the rehabilitation of the populations and their associated fisheries (professional, sportive and even spawning stocks). Those results showed that some limitant factors at precocious stages were acting before the stage of fed alevins (presummerlings for whitefish and <b>summerlings</b> for Arctic charr). In the beginning of the final stage of reoligotrophication, the situation and the dymamic of the evolution of catches was quite different for the two species:For the whitefish, the catches strongly increase during reoligotrophication. The contribution of stockings (with 100 - 320 000 just-fed 14 - 18 mm alevins) is small, near 10 %, but however the recapture rates by the professional fishery are good (2, 3 - 7, 8 kg/ 1000 just-fed alevins). The study demonstrates a strong expansion of the functionality of natural recruitment of the population of whitefish. For the Artic charr, the contribution of stocking is always dominant (80 - 90 %) in the catches by the fisheries. On the contrary the recapture rates have decreased during reoligotrophication, from 23 - 56 to 12 - 18 kg/ 1000 <b>summerlings.</b> On the contrary to the whitefish, there is no recovery of an efficient natural recruitment for the Arctic charr. These differential evolutions between the two species during reoligotrophication are discussed using comparative ecology. Practically, in a lake with both natural and artificial recruitment, the present study demonstrated that mass marking campaigns are very useful to evaluate the evolution of the two components of recruitment both in catches by fisheries and at spawner stage...|$|R
40|$|The white-clawed crayfish, Austropotamobius pallipes, is {{the only}} native species of {{freshwater}} crayfish in Spain. This species sustained a first-magnitude inland fishery {{up to the end}} of 1970 's, when the crayfish plague struck the Spanish waters. It is detected an overall loss of distribution area of populations inhabiting the medium and lower reaches of the main river catchments, especially in Southern and Central Spain. The number of surviving populations can be estimated in ca. 700. Remaining native crayfish populations currently inhabit marginal areas. The populations are very fragmented, occupy short stretches, and are frequently isolated from the main river system. The current distribution {{is the result of a}} sum of different factors, i. e. crayfish plague, habitat alterations, extreme climatic drought, etc. The incidence and relative importance of each one varied during the last 15 years, with crayfish plague being a predominant negative factor in the seventies and eighties, and climatic drought in the nineties. The current trend of disappearance is a sufficient reason to consider the native crayfish as at risk of extinction. However neither the national legislation nor most of the regional government legislations have listed this species as endangered. An analysis of the legislation dealing with freshwater crayfish in Spain shows : (a) an uneven and generally low level of protection given to the native species and (b) a very complex fishing and commercialization regulations for crayfish that show significant changes from one region to another. This complex legislation, complemented with a general lack of data on crayfish populations, low levels of management and public involvement, and different strategies in regional governments regarding restocking programs with exotic species, makes a confusing situation. In order to decrease the general tendency of regression of A. pallipes a conservation program for this species needs to be implemented in Spain. This program should include a number of regulations to be followed for the particular autonomous regions of Spain. This program should include measures : (a) to restore native crayfish populations, i. e. by translocations or stocking with farm raised of <b>summerlings,</b> in designated areas where the risk for crayfish plague outbreaks is low, (b) to control the spread of introduced species, by controlling their means of dispersal which usually occurs by human activities, i. e. trade of live crayfish, exotic crayfish stocking programs, crayfishing, aquaculture purposes, etc., and by developing eradication methods for unwanted crayfish populations; (c) to increase the surveillance of remaining native populations by providing the areas with native crayfish the protection level required by the European Community Directives for the Conservation of Natural Habitats and Wild Flora and Fauna (92 / 43 /EEC and 97 / 62 /EU); and finally (d) to improve public and administration awareness...|$|R
