The decision was upheld in July 2009 by the Upper Administrative Court of Berlin-Brandenburg which ruled that the poster violated Scientologists' basic religious rights.|$|E

25|$|But in 1951 I {{found myself}} in serious difficulty. I had been {{commissioned}} by the National Broadcasting Company to write an opera for television, with Christmas as deadline, and I simply didn't have one idea in my head. One November afternoon as I was walking rather gloomily through the rooms of the Metropolitan Museum, I chanced to <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the Adoration of the Kings by Hieronymus Bosch, and as I was looking at it, suddenly I heard again, coming from the distant blue hills, the weird song of the Three Kings. I then realized they {{had come back to}} me and had brought me a gift.|$|E

2500|$|At about 12:40p.m., Oswald {{boarded a}} city bus but (probably due to heavy traffic) {{requested}} a transfer {{from the bus}} driver and got off two blocks later. Oswald took a taxicab to his rooming house, at 1026 North Beckley Avenue, arriving at about 1:00p.m. He entered {{through the front door}} and, according to his housekeeper, Earlene Roberts, immediately went to his room, [...] "walking pretty fast." [...] Roberts said that Oswald left [...] "a very few minutes" [...] later, zipping up a jacket he was not wearing when he had entered earlier. As Oswald left, Roberts looked out of the window of her house and last saw him standing at the northbound Beckley Avenue bus <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> her house.|$|E
2500|$|After {{working all}} day, Parks boarded the Cleveland Avenue bus, a General Motors Old Look bus {{belonging}} to the Montgomery City Lines, around 6p.m., Thursday, December 1, 1955, in downtown Montgomery. She paid her fare and sat in an empty seat {{in the first row}} of back seats reserved for blacks in the [...] "colored" [...] section. Near the middle of the bus, her row was directly behind the ten seats reserved for white passengers. Initially, she did not notice that the bus driver was the same man, James F. Blake, who had left her in the rain in 1943. As the bus traveled along its regular route, all of the white-only seats in the bus filled up. The bus reached the third <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the Empire Theater, and several white passengers boarded.|$|E

2500|$|SpongeBob cries hopelessly {{but then}} sees that Patrick has the key; in fact, {{he found it}} while he cleaned SpongeBob's pants. They {{go back into the}} train and {{are on their way to}} the bank. Eventually, Plankton steals the key and bats them out of a window then they must chase the train. SpongeBob morphs himself into a hang glider and he and Patrick fly back onto the train to pursue him. Once they return, SpongeBob and Patrick chase Plankton. But, Plankton {{disconnects}} the cars of the train, leaving SpongeBob and Patrick in the front car. SpongeBob and Patrick try to stop the train but Patrick stupidly breaks the brake of the train causing the train to go out of control. He makes several (but stupid) futile attempts to stop the train, including putting a heavy boulder on the tracks. This only causes the train to flip and move forward while some of the wheels are off the track. The two manage to bring all wheels back in place when they <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> a retirement home. Then, Patrick stupidly breaks the throttle. Meanwhile, Plankton is seen trying to steal the formula but is stopped by Mr. Krabs. However, he secretly escapes with it, but the train comes into the bank and stops Plankton before he could leave. Plankton's plan fails again, and Mr. Krabs has to pay the damage to the bank with his bank account. 75 years later, SpongeBob, shown as an elderly, finishes the story of the [...] "Great Train Caper". His grandson responds with a cheer in excitement over his video game.|$|E

[...] for, since quitting London he had never seen himself as others saw him, having been too hurried, on both occasions of passing through Canadian cities, to note the mirrors there. In the backwoods, of course, there was nothing large enough in the way of mirror to show more than his good-looking face.|$|E
60|$|So Mr. Burke was {{looked upon}} {{not only as}} a man of wealth and {{superior}} tastes in regard to food and personal comfort, but as a man of a liberal and generous disposition. Furthermore, there was no pride about him. Often on his return from his drives, his barouche and pair, which Mr. Williams had obtained in Harrington for his guest's express benefit, would <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> Mrs. Cliff's modest residence; and two or three times he had taken that good lady and Willy Croup to drive with him.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Cliff now {{began her}} life as a rich woman. The Thorpedykes were {{established}} in the new building; her carriage and horses, with a coachman in plain livery, were seen upon the streets of Plainton; she gave dinners and teas, and subscribed in a modestly open way to appropriate charities; she extended suitable aid to the members of Mrs. Ferguson's family, both living and departed; {{and the fact that she}} was willing to help in church work was made very plain by a remark of Miss Shott, who, upon a certain Sunday morning at the conclusion of services, happened to <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> Mrs. Cliff, who was going out of the church.|$|E

60|$|MY {{aunt was}} a little more {{imperious}} and stern than usual, but I observed no other token of her preparing herself to receive the visitor so much dreaded by me. She sat at work in the window, and I sat by, with my thoughts running astray on all possible and impossible results of Mr. Murdstone's visit, until pretty late in the afternoon. Our dinner had been indefinitely postponed; but it was growing so late, that my aunt had ordered it to be got ready, when she gave a sudden alarm of donkeys, and to my consternation and amazement, I beheld Miss Murdstone, on a side-saddle, ride deliberately over the sacred piece of green, and <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the house, looking about her.|$|E
6000|$|One evening, as {{they were}} together, after {{his work in the}} garden was over, the horse said to him: 'To-morrow a large company of princes and great lords are coming to your king's palace. They are coming from far and near, as wooers for the three princesses. They will all stand in a row in the {{courtyard}} of the palace, and the three princesses will come out, and each will carry a diamond apple in her hand, which she will throw into the air. At whose-soever feet the apple falls he will be the bridegroom of that princess. You must be close by in the garden at your work. The apple of the youngest princess, who is much the most beautiful of the sisters, will roll past the wooers and <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> you. Pick it up at once and put it in your pocket.' ...|$|E

As soon as he has taken them up he will drive off and give them into the charge of our mother, who has promised you to have {{everything}} in readiness for them; the skins for beds, drinking vessels, food, and everything else necessary was taken there two days ago. My sisters will see to the comfort of the young lady, and you can rely upon my mother to carry out all the orders you have given her. Our hut lies so deeply in the forest that there is little chance of anyone going near it, especially as the whole of the men of the tribe are away." ...|$|E

[...] {{he exclaimed}} mentally, [...] "he {{said he was}} The Oskaloosie Kid, 'n' that he shot a man last night; but what I'd like to know is how I'm goin' to shadder him from this here book. Here it says: 'If the {{criminal}} gets on a street car and then jumps off at the next corner the good detective will know that his man is aware that he is being shadowed, and will stay on the car and telephone {{his office at the}} first opportunity.' 'N'ere it sez: 'If your man gets into a carriage don't run up an' jump on the back of it; but simply hire another carriage and follow.' How in hek kin I foller this book?" [...] wailed Willie. [...] "They ain't no street cars 'round here.

I reckon I threw away my four-bits on this book--it don't tell a feller nothin' 'bout false whiskers, wigs 'n' the like," [...] and he tossed the book disgustedly into a corner, rose and descended to the barnyard. Here he busied himself about some task that should have been attended to a week before, and which even now was not destined to be completed that day, since Willie had no more than set himself to it than his attention was distracted by the sudden appearance of a touring car being brought to a <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the gate.|$|E
60|$|The cavalcade {{passed out}} by the lower gate of Phoenix park saluted by obsequious policemen and {{proceeded}} past Kingsbridge along the northern quays. The viceroy was most cordially greeted on {{his way through the}} metropolis. At Bloody bridge Mr Thomas Kernan beyond the river greeted him vainly from afar Between Queen's and Whitworth bridges lord Dudley's viceregal carriages passed and were unsaluted by Mr Dudley White, B. L., M. A., who stood on Arran quay outside Mrs M. E. White's, the pawnbroker's, at the corner of Arran street west stroking his nose with his forefinger, undecided whether he should arrive at Phibsborough more quickly by a triple change of tram or by hailing a car or on foot through Smithfield, Constitution hill and Broadstone terminus. In the porch of Four Courts Richie Goulding with the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward saw him with surprise. Past Richmond bridge at the doorstep of the office of Reuben J Dodd, solicitor, agent for the Patriotic Insurance Company, an elderly female about to enter changed her plan and retracing her steps by King's windows smiled credulously on the representative of His Majesty. From its sluice in Wood quay wall under Tom Devan's office Poddle river hung out in fealty a tongue of liquid sewage. Above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel, gold by bronze, Miss Kennedy's head by Miss Douce's head watched and admired. On Ormond quay Mr Simon Dedalus, steering his way from the greenhouse for the subsheriff's office, stood still in midstreet and brought his hat low. His Excellency graciously returned Mr Dedalus' greeting. From Cahill's corner the reverend Hugh C. Love, M.A., made obeisance unperceived, mindful of lords deputies whose hands benignant had held of yore rich advowsons. On Grattan bridge Lenehan and M'Coy, taking leave of each other, watched the carriages go by. Passing by Roger Greene's office and Dollard's big red printinghouse Gerty MacDowell, carrying the Catesby's cork lino letters for her father who was laid up, knew by the style it was the lord and lady lieutenant but she couldn't see what Her Excellency had on because the tram and Spring's big yellow furniture van had to <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> her on account of its being the lord lieutenant. Beyond Lundy Foot's from the shaded door of Kavanagh's winerooms John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness towards the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland. The Right Honourable William Humble, earl of Dudley, G. C. V. O., passed Micky Anderson's all times ticking watches and Henry and James's wax smartsuited freshcheeked models, the gentleman Henry, dernier cri James. Over against Dame gate Tom Rochford and Nosey Flynn watched the approach of the cavalcade. Tom Rochford, seeing the eyes of lady Dudley fixed on him, took his thumbs quickly out of the pockets of his claret waistcoat and doffed his cap to her. A charming soubrette, great Marie Kendall, with dauby cheeks and lifted skirt smiled daubily from her poster upon William Humble, earl of Dudley, and upon lieutenantcolonel H. G. Heseltine, and also upon the honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C. From the window of the D. B. C. Buck Mulligan gaily, and Haines gravely, gazed down on the viceregal equipage over the shoulders of eager guests, whose mass of forms darkened the chessboard whereon John Howard Parnell looked intently. In Fownes's street Dilly Dedalus, straining her sight upward from Chardenal's first French primer, saw sunshades spanned and wheelspokes spinning in the glare. John Henry Menton, filling the doorway of Commercial Buildings, stared from winebig oyster eyes, holding a fat gold hunter watch not looked at in his fat left hand not feeling it. Where the foreleg of King Billy's horse pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked her hastening husband back from under the hoofs of the outriders. She shouted in his ear the tidings. Understanding, he shifted his tomes to his left breast and saluted the second carriage. The honourable Gerald Ward A.D.C., agreeably surprised, made haste to reply. At Ponsonby's corner a jaded white flagon H. halted and four tallhatted white flagons halted behind him, E.L.Y'S, while outriders pranced past and carriages. Opposite Pigott's music warerooms Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, gaily apparelled, gravely walked, outpassed by a viceroy and unobserved. By the provost's wall came jauntily Blazes Boylan, stepping in tan shoes and socks with skyblue clocks to the refrain of My girl's a Yorkshire girl.|$|E
