5|$|Aarhus {{is known}} for its musical history. In the 1950s many jazz clubs <b>sprang</b> <b>up</b> around the city, fuelled by the young population. By the 1960s, the music scene diversified into rock and other genres. In the 1970s and 1980s, Aarhus became the centre for Denmark's rock music {{fostering}} many iconic bands such as TV-2 and Gnags. Aarhus is home to the annual eight-day Aarhus International Jazz Festival, the SPoT Festival and the NorthSide Festival.|$|E
5|$|Beaver Meadow CCC Camp S-71was {{built in}} May 1933near the {{abandoned}} village of Beaver Mills, {{and was one}} of the first to expand recreational facilities in Pennsylvania. Over 200young men moved in and began the work of conserving soil, water, and timber in the area. They cut roads through the growing forest to aid in fighting the wildfires that <b>sprang</b> <b>up,</b> and planted many acres of Red Pines as part of the reforestation effort.|$|E

5|$|Gold rush–related boomtowns <b>sprang</b> <b>up</b> near Mono Basin in the 19th {{century to}} exploit bonanzas. The largest of these, Bodie (north of Mono Lake), {{was founded in}} the late 1870s and grew large enough to need a tree mill, which was located at Mono Mills, {{immediately}} northeast of Mono Domes. Trees directly around the domes and on their slopes were felled to provide timber for the mill.|$|E
5|$|H.M.S. Pinafore was so {{successful}} that Carte soon sent two additional companies out to tour in the provinces. The opera ran for 571 performances in London, the second-longest run in musical theatre history up to that time. Over 150 unauthorised productions <b>sprang</b> <b>up</b> in America alone, but because American law then offered no copyright protection to foreigners, Carte, Gilbert and Sullivan {{were not able to}} demand royalties from, or to control the artistic content of, these productions.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, {{through an}} {{advertisement}} {{in the national}} press, contact was made between former paratroopers in Wiesbaden and four English ex-servicemen in Royal Tunbridge Wells. Through this contact the friendship that now exists between the two towns <b>sprang</b> <b>up,</b> leading to the signing in 1989 of the official Twinning Charter. Also through this the Tunbridge Wells Twinning and Friendship Association (TWTFA) was formed.|$|E

5|$|In late 1818, however, {{demand for}} U.S. goods fell sharply in Europe. Land values {{also began to}} fall, {{touching}} off the Panic of 1819. Many persons in the state were unable to repay their loans. A struggle began between creditors seeking to collect money owed to them and debtors seeking relief from obligations they could not meet. A Debt Relief Party <b>sprang</b> <b>up</b> in the state, which had long been a single-party bastion.|$|E
5|$|In the 9th century, {{a legend}} <b>sprang</b> <b>up</b> {{to the effect}} that an ancient column at the Forum of Taurus had an {{inscription}} predicting that Constantinople would be conquered by the Rus. This legend, well known in Byzantine literature, was revived by the Slavophiles in the 19th century, when Russia was on the point of wresting the city from the Ottomans.|$|E
5|$|One legend {{states that}} when Andrew the Apostle visited the {{uninhabited}} {{mountains in the}} mid-stream of the Dnieper River (today's Andriyvskyy Descent area), he put up a cross atop of the hill where the descent starts and prophesied a foundation of a great Christian city. Since that time, wooden churches <b>sprang</b> <b>up</b> around in the vicinity, completing his prophecy.|$|E

This confuses some disciples including Maitreya, but the Buddha affirms that he has taught all of these bodhisattvas himself.|$|R
5|$|Prisoners {{would often}} take their {{families}} with them, {{which meant that}} entire communities <b>sprang</b> <b>up</b> inside the debtors' jails. The community created its own economy, with jailers charging for room, food, drink and furniture, or selling concessions to others, and attorneys charging fees in fruitless efforts to get the debtors out. Prisoners' families, including children, often had to find employment simply {{to cover the cost}} of the imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|The {{architecture}} of Denmark has {{its origins in}} the Viking period, richly revealed by archaeological finds. It became firmly established in the Middle Ages when first Romanesque, then Gothic churches and cathedrals <b>sprang</b> <b>up</b> throughout the country. It was during this period that, {{in a country with}} little access to stone, brick became the construction material of choice, not just for churches but also for fortifications and castles.|$|E
5|$|The city of Klamath Falls (southeast of Yamsay) <b>sprang</b> <b>up</b> in the 1920s and {{featured}} the fastest-growing population in Oregon.

This opened the area for logging and timber business, which became the focus of the profit of the area.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of gold near Barnette's trading post {{caused him to}} turn {{what had been a}} temporary stop into a permanent one. The gold caused a stampede of miners to the area, and buildings <b>sprang</b> <b>up</b> around Barnette's trading post. In November 1903, the area's residents voted to incorporate the city of Fairbanks. Barnette became the city's first mayor, and the city flourished as thousands of people came in search of gold during the Fairbanks Gold Rush.|$|E
5|$|The {{towns and}} cities along the lower basin of the river {{are some of the}} oldest in Florida, and their {{histories}} have centered on the river. Both Palatka and Green Cove Springs have been popular tourist destinations in the past. Several smaller locations along the river <b>sprang</b> <b>up</b> around ferry landings, but when rail lines and then Interstate highways were constructed closer to the Atlantic Coast, many of the towns experienced significant economic decline, and ferry landings were forgotten.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, Barre's regime had become {{increasingly}} unpopular. The authorities became ever more totalitarian, and resistance movements, encouraged by Ethiopia's communist Derg administration, <b>sprang</b> <b>up</b> across the country. This eventually led in 1991 to {{the outbreak of}} the civil war, the toppling of Barre's government, and the disbandment of the Somali National Army. Many of the opposition groups subsequently began competing for influence in the power vacuum that followed the ouster of Barre's regime. Armed factions led by United Somali Congress commanders General Mohamed Farah Aidid and Ali Mahdi Mohamed, in particular, clashed as each sought to exert authority over the capital.|$|E

5|$|During the {{afternoon}} of 12 October, a gale <b>sprang</b> <b>up</b> which inflicted further damage to the battered ships and caused water to gush through the many shot holes in the ships' hulls. Aboard the Dutch ships, the situation was especially dangerous. Casualties had been significantly higher, particularly on Vrijheid, than on board the British vessels and the small numbers of British sailors placed aboard as prize crews were unable to cope alone, and in the high winds many masts collapsed to the deck and huge quantities of water leaked into the hulls.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{advocate}} for the many thousands of returned servicemen and women many ex-services organisations <b>sprang</b> <b>up.</b> The most prominent of these was probably the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia which had been established in 1916 by representatives from many state-based organisations already in existence. Following the war this organisation grew in its political influence as its numbers grew and was very active in the repatriation process, advocating for financial entitlements for veterans and securing concessions for soldiers returning to civilian employment. By 1919 it was estimated to have 150,000 members although this fell dramatically in the mid-1920s.|$|E
5|$|The first {{industrial}} canal in Wales {{was built}} in 1768 to convey coal from the Gwendraeth Valley to the coast, and the following year, the earliest tramroad bridge was on the tramroad built alongside the canal. During the Napoleonic Wars (1799–1815) there was increased demand for coal, iron and agricultural goods, and the county prospered. The landscape changed as much woodland was cleared {{to make way for}} more food production, and mills, power stations, mines and factories <b>sprang</b> <b>up</b> between Llanelli and Pembrey. Carmarthenshire was at the centre of the Rebecca Riots around 1840, when local farmers and agricultural workers dressed as women and rebelled against higher taxes and tolls.|$|E
