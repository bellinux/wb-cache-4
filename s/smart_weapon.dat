40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 27 - 30, 1997 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaThe Army’s {{continuing}} {{effort to}} develop self-guided, anti-tank weapon systems has been fueled by successful development of an earlier generation of smart weapons. These self-guided systems, also labeled “brilliant weapons,” will present a natural progression to “smart” weapons development and testing. What has been {{critical to the success}} of these smart weapons development programs has been an end-to-end testability provided by on-board telemetry methods. The end-to-end test procedures can be efficiently performed in a static laboratory environment where space is available. On board the <b>smart</b> <b>weapon,</b> end-to-end testability is less feasible due to space and bandwidth limitations. The STAFF XM 943 projectile development program makes use of a dual telemetry link to transmit an array of measurements which characterize the performance of the projectile in and end-to-end fashion. The dual telemetry systems provide analog measurement capability to evaluate system component-level functions and digital measurement capability to evaluate a system processor which lends itself to computer processing. The digital data is intrinsic to <b>smart</b> <b>weapon</b> systems since they typically employ embedded microprocessors for projectile system control. The STAFF XM 943 electronic system is controlled by a TMS 320 C 30 microprocessor.

40|$|A {{physical}} {{method to}} alter the trajectory of a projectile is a critical element of any <b>smart</b> <b>weapon.</b> Creation of an appropriate controlmechanism is often one of themore difficult parts of the overall design due to size, durability, and control authority requirements. The work reported here considers a vibrating internal mass control mechanism applicable to both fin- and spin-stabilized configurations. To investigate the potential of this control mechanism, a 7 -degree-of-freedom flight dynamic model of a projectile equipped with an internal translating mass is generated. By vibrating the internal translating mass normal to the axis of symmetry and at the roll rate frequency, significant control authority can be attained with a relatively small internal mass {{on the order of}} a percent or so of the total projectile mass. Interestingly, control authority increases proportionally with increasing roll rate and also with increasing station-line cavity offset from the mass center. Trajectory changes are not caused by lateral mass center offset and drag but rather by dynamic coupling between internal mass vibration and the projectile body.

40|$|Presentation date: 2006 - 06 - 13 Graduation date: 2007 Smart weapons {{promise to}} provide leap ahead {{capability}} {{with regard to}} accuracy and engagement range for medium and large caliber projectiles. One {{of the most critical}} components of a <b>smart</b> <b>weapon</b> system is its sensor suite that provides position, orientation, and velocity information as the projectile flies down range so that effective control action can be taken in flight. Great strides have been made in creating very small and rugged Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) using MEMS accelerometers and vibrating gyroscopes. However, all IMU systems operate by integrating accelerometer and gyroscope measurements. Thus, they must be initialized at launch to produce sufficiently accurate position and orientation data. Due to inherent uncertainty in shot-to-shot launch conditions, for gun launched projectiles, initial conditions cannot be adequately specified by the firing platform like it can with aircraft and missiles. Currently, there is no adequate method to initialize IMU sensor suites on gun launched munitions. This thesis investigates a novel concept for determining the full state of a projectile near the muzzle of the gun. The methodology relies on the gun system inducing a known spatially varying magnetic field {{in the vicinity of the}} muzzle of the gun. Using readings from a cluster of magnetometers embedded within the projectile, the full state of the projectile is determined by solving a nonlinear set of equations...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} a {{contribution}} to the Smart Weapons Operability Enhancement (SWOE) Program. SWOE is a coordinated, Army, Navy, Manne Corps and Air Force program initiated to enhance performance of future <b>smart</b> <b>weapon</b> systems. Performance of smart weapons can vary widely, depending on the environment in which the systems operate. Temporal and spatial dynamics can significantly impact weapon performance. Testing of developmental weapon systems has been limited to a few selected combinations of targets and environmental conditions, primarily because of the high costs of full-scale field tests and limited access to the areas or events for which performance data are required. Performance predictions are needed for a broad range of possible battlefield environmental conditions and targets. Meeting this need takes advantage of significant DoD investments by Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force and ARPA in 1) basic and applied environmental research, data collection, analysis, modeling and rendering capabilities, 2) extensive target measurement capabilities and geometry models, and 3) currently available computational capabilities. SWOE is developing, validating, and demonstrating the capability to handle complex target and background environment interactions for a broad range of battlefield conditions. SWOE is providing the DoD smart weapons and autonomous target recognition (ATR) communities with measurements, information bases, modeling and scene rendering techniques for complex environments. These are products of a DoD-wide partnership that works in concert with both advanced weapon system developers and major weapon system test and evaluation programs...|$|E

40|$|The {{field of}} guided {{projectile}} research has continually grown {{over the past}} several decades. Guided projectiles, typically encompassing bullets, mortars, and artillery shells, incorporate some sort of guidance and control mechanism to generate trajectory alterations. This serves to increase accuracy and decrease collateral damage. Control mechanisms for smart weapons must be able to withstand extreme acceleration loads at launch while remain simple for cost and reliability reasons. One type of control mechanism utilizes controllable internal translating masses (ITM's) that oscillate within the projectile to generate control forces. 	Several techniques for using internal translating masses for <b>smart</b> <b>weapon</b> flight control purposes are explored here. Specifically, the use of ITM's as direct control mechanisms, as a means to increase control authority, and as a means to protect the smart weapons sensor suite are examined. It is first shown that oscillating a mass orthogonal to the projectile axis of symmetry generates reasonable control force in statically-stable rounds. Trade studies examine the impact of mass size, mass offset from the center of gravity, and reductions in static stability on control authority. Then, the topic of static margin control through mass center modification is explored. This is accomplished by translating a mass in flight along the projectile axis of symmetry. Results show that this system allows for greater control authority and reduced throw-off error at launch. Another study, aimed at examining shock reduction potential at launch rather than static margin alteration, also considers ITM movement along the projectile centerline. In these studies, the ITM is comprised of sensitive electronic sensors, and is configured as a first-order damper during launch. Trade study results show that although the mechanism cannot substantially reduce the magnitude of launch loads, it is successful at dampening harmful structural vibrations typically experienced after muzzle exit. Finally, an active control system is developed for the ITM control mechanism using sliding mode methodology. Example cases and Monte Carlo simulations incorporating model uncertainties and sensor errors show that ITM control of projectiles can substantially reduce dispersion error. Furthermore, the novel sliding mode control law is shown to be highly robust to feedback disturbances. In a final study, combined ITM-canard control of projectiles is explored, concluding that ITM mechanisms can serve as a useful supplement in increasing the efficiency of currently-deployed control mechanisms.
