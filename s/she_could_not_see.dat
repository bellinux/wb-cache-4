She sailed north that afternoon, firing at rail lines and railroad tunnels as she made for Tanchon, where she launched a whaleboat {{in an attempt to}} spot a train known to run nightly along the coast. Her big guns were trained on two tunnels between which she hoped to catch the train, but in the darkness <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> the results of her six-gun salvo.|$|E
25|$|Jenny {{was heavily}} criticised by Sir Alan and Margaret {{for not only}} {{coming up with a}} poor idea for their cards, refusing to take any {{responsibility}} for the loss, and blatantly trying to scapegoat Sara, but also for suddenly declaring during one pitch that she no longer bought greetings cards because of their environmental impact. Sir Alan was appalled that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> the inherent contradiction in her words in regards to the team's product.|$|E
25|$|Finances dwindling, she and {{her mother}} moved back to Kansas City after Skip Harlow issued an {{ultimatum}} that he would disinherit Jean if she did not return. Several weeks later, Skip sent his granddaughter to a summer camp, Camp Cha-Ton-Ka, in Michigamme, Michigan, where she became ill with scarlet fever. Her mother traveled to Michigan to care for her, rowing herself across the lake to the camp, but was told <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> her daughter.|$|E

25|$|To Antonino Votto, Callas wasThe {{last great}} artist. When {{you think this}} woman was nearly blind, and often sang {{standing}} a good 150 feet from the podium. But her sensitivity! Even if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>see,</b> she sensed the music and always came in exactly with my downbeat. When we rehearsed, she was so precise, already note-perfect... She {{was not just a}} singer, but a complete artist. It's foolish to discuss her as a voice. She must be viewed totally—as a complex of music, drama, movement. There is no one like her today. She was an esthetic phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Leland Chapman—a {{colleague}} of Fishbaugh—was {{called in to}} give a second opinion; he recognized {{that she was not}} suffering from an inflamed gallbladder, but was in the end stages of kidney failure. On June 6, Harlow said that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> Powell properly and could not tell how many fingers he was holding up. That evening, Harlow was taken to Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles, where she slipped into a coma. The next day at 11:37am, Harlow died in the hospital at the age of 26. In the doctor's press releases, {{the cause of death was}} given as cerebral edema, a complication of kidney failure. Hospital records mention uremia.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} scandal {{occurred}} on Easter Sunday in 1768, in which Sade procured {{the services of}} a woman, Rose Keller, a widow-beggar who approached him for alms. He told her she could make money by working for him—she understood her work to be that of a housekeeper. At his chateau at Arcueil, Sade ripped her clothes off, threw her on a divan and tied her by the four limbs, face-down, so that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> behind her. Then he whipped her. Keller testified that he made various incisions on her body into which he poured hot wax, although investigators found no broken skin on Keller, and Sade explained that he had applied ointment to her after the whipping. Keller finally escaped by climbing out of a second-floor window and running away. At this time, la Présidente, Sade's mother-in-law, obtained a lettre de cachet (a royal order of arrest and imprisonment, without stated cause or access to the courts) from the King, excluding Sade from the jurisdiction of the courts. The lettre de cachet would later prove disastrous for the marquis.|$|E
60|$|It seemed {{from the}} shrill pertinacity with which Miss Miggs {{repeated}} {{this form of}} acclamation, that she was calling the same through the keyhole of the door; but in the profound darkness <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be <b>seen.</b>|$|R

25|$|Yasuna's unique affliction to {{be unable}} to see males is changed from the manga to the anime. While in the manga Yasuna says she has never once {{been able to see}} males {{completely}} clearly (Hazumu being the only slight exception), Yasuna explains in the anime that she at one time was able to see males, but one day <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> her father anymore after he got angry with her as a child, and it escalated from there to encompass all males. Additionally, in the eleventh anime episode, Yasuna becomes unable to see females as well, though this is later rectified in episode twelve when Yasuna is completely healed and is able to see both males and females. In the anime, Yasuna is shown to be terrified of males, even those in her own class, but in the manga she merely pays very little attention to males around her, even when spoken to directly, or otherwise ignores males completely. In the anime, Yasuna is shown at one time accidentally ignoring her father at the dinner table, but the only time Yasuna is shown speaking to her father in the manga has her smiling to him.|$|E
25|$|The defense {{strategy}} was to impeach {{the testimony of the}} key prosecution witnesses: Lloyd and Weichmann. It also wished to show that she was loyal to the Union, her trips to Surrattsville were of an innocent nature, and she had not been aware of Booth's plans. There were 31 witnesses who testified for the defense. George H. Calvert testified that he had pressed Surratt to pay a debt, Bennett Gwynn said Surratt had sought payment from John Nothey to satisfy the Calvert debt, and Nothey agreed that he had received a letter from Surratt for him to appear at the tavern on April 11 to pay what was owed. Several witnesses impugned Lloyd's character by testifying about his alcoholism. Several eyewitnesses said he appeared completely intoxicated on the day of Lincoln's death (April 14) and implied that he could not have remembered that day clearly. (However, Lloyd had testified that he repaired a broken spring on Surratt's wagon, which rebutted the claims.) Augustus Howell, a Confederate agent, testified that Surratt's eyesight was poor and that Weichmann was an untrustworthy witness, as he had sought to become a Confederate spy himself. (The prosecution had attempted to show that Howell was a Confederate spy and should not be trusted.) Anna Surratt testified that it was Weichmann who had brought Atzerodt into the boarding house, that the photograph of Booth was hers (given to her by her father in 1862), and that she owned photographs of Union political and military leaders. Anna denied ever overhearing any discussions of disloyal activities or ideas in the boarding house, and she said that while Booth visited the house many times, his stays were always short. Anna explained her mother's failure to recognize Powell by asserting <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> well. Honora Fitzpatrick was called back to the stand and testified to Mary's poor eysight as well. A former servant and a former slave both said her eyesight was failing and that she had given Union soldiers food. Numerous witnesses were called {{at the end of the}} defense's case to testify to her loyalty to the Union, her deep Christian faith, and her kindness. A number of Catholic priests were called to the stand to testify about Surratt's faith, good character, and incorruptibility. Portraying Surratt as a good Christian woman incapable of committing the crimes for which she was accused was a large part of the {{defense strategy}}. During the prosecution's rebuttal, government lawyers called four witnesses (P.T. Ransford, John Ryan, Frank Stith, and James Young) to the stand, who testified as to Weichmann's unimpeachable character.|$|E
500|$|As the {{postcard}} effort was reaching its peak, tabloid newspapers {{speculated that the}} Labour Party wanted to put Hewson up for the Irish presidential election of 2004, with the Daily Mirror quoting an unnamed party insider as saying, [...] "She's a mother of four but she has always had world issues at heart and she'd make the perfect candidate." [...] (Labour had succeeded with its candidate Mary Robinson in the 1990 election but came in fourth with Roche in the 1997 election.) Hewson stated {{that she had not}} been approached, and that [...] "It's not a serious proposition. It would obviously be a huge honour if I was asked to take on such a huge task, but for one thing I'm not sure I'm qualified, and for another I've got four small kids to bring up first." [...] She also expressed contentment with incumbent President Mary McAleese staying for another term. She jokingly added that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> Bono agreeing to live in a smaller house. Hewson received a media mention two years later as a possible Social Democratic and Labour Party candidate in the 2004 European Parliament elections after John Hume had stood down. [...] The notion of her running for Irish president came up again in 2008 in conjunction with the 2011 election; columnist Fiona Looney wrote in the Daily Mail that while [...] "she is certainly a decent and smart woman", the position was better held by someone with a stronger background and more diplomatic experience. Hewson demurred once more, saying she did not speak the Irish language well enough, this time adding humorously that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> her husband being willing to walk behind her at events. The candidate that Labour did put up, Michael D. Higgins, won the post. Notwithstanding this speculation, Hewson generally shies away from political comments in the media.|$|E

500|$|Dorothy gains {{control of}} the Flying Monkeys by giving back the group's Magic Biker Cap to Sal Minella. She has Scarecrow and Tin Thing rebuilt by the Flying Monkeys. Then {{she and her friends}} travel back to the Emerald City to have their wishes granted. When they all storm into the Wizard's room, they {{discover}} it is merely a Hollywood effects stage and that the Wizard (Jeffrey Tambor) is just an ordinary man, pretending. He asked for the witch's eye so that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> him for who he really was. Even so, he still proceeds to grant their wishes. Dorothy finally becomes a singer in the Land of Oz, but she realizes that all she ever really wanted was to go back home and be with her family. After traveling back to Munchkinland, she meets Glinda the Good Witch of the South (Miss Piggy), who tells her that if she clicks her heels together three times, she will be able to go anywhere she desires, contrary to how the Good Witch of the North said to get to the Emerald City. She does so, saying [...] "take me home to Aunt Em".|$|E
2500|$|In 1993, {{at the age}} of six, Sharapova {{attended}} a tennis clinic in Moscow run by Martina Navratilova, who recommended professional training at the IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida, which had previously trained players such as Andre Agassi, Monica Seles, and Anna Kournikova. With money tight, Yuri Sharapov borrowed the sum that would enable him and his daughter, neither of whom could speak English, to travel to the United States of America, which they finally did in 1994. Visa restrictions prevented Sharapova's mother from joining them for two years. Arriving in Florida with savings of US$700, Sharapova's father took various low-paying jobs, including dishwashing, to fund her lessons until she was old enough to be admitted to the academy. Before she entered the IMG business, she trained with Rick Macci, in the Rick Macci Tennis Academy. She then was offered a deal from IMG which forced her to change academies. Originally, she did train with Rick Macci, but after the deal with IMG, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> Rick Macci anymore. [...] In 1995, she was signed by IMG, who agreed to pay the annual tuition fee of $35,000 for Sharapova to stay at the Academy, allowing her to finally enroll {{at the age of}} 9.|$|E
60|$|A {{brightness}} {{was on her}} face, {{a little}} unreality in her teaching. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> quite <b>see</b> her children.

2500|$|Emily Gregory [...] Pianist. Emily is the {{daughter}} of a renowned scholar of Ancient Greece. Her mother is evidently deceased. Her father once rented an apartment in their house to two scientists visiting New York to work on the Micro-Ray. An intruder broke into the house to steal papers related to the design of the Micro-Ray, only to find Emily, aged ten. The intruder used an uncontrolled Micro-Ray to [...] "temporarily" [...] blind Emily so that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>see</b> his face, but the Micro-Ray destroyed her optic nerve and blinded her permanently, instead. In The Young Unicorns Emily, now twelve, has resumed her study of the piano with Mr. Theo and is regarded as a prodigy. She has received high-quality training in braille and mobility for the blind at the instigation of Dr. Hyde, the head of the Micro-Ray project. She attends the St. Andrews School, where the Austin children go while they live in New York City. The Austins rent the apartment in Emily's home where the two scientists—Dr. Austin's predecessors in the Micro-Ray project—lived, and where Emily was blinded by the burglar. [...] "Dave" [...] Davidson is employed as her reader and is responsible for helping her get about the neighborhood and looks after her generally. Emily has used her musician's understanding of sound to help her adapt to blindness and has a near-perfect memory for where objects had been placed—so much so that people ask her where they left things. When she recognizes the voice of the false Genie, she unmasks one of the principal villains of The Young Unicorns—and solves the mystery of her blinding. [...] In A Severed Wasp, it is revealed that Emily is now known as Emily de Cortez, married to a conductor named Pio de Cortez, and, in Katherine Vigneras' opinion, [...] "surely one of the best-known interpreters of South American music." [...] As an adult, she has been discreet about her disability because, as Dave Davidson explains, [...] "she wants to be known for her music, not as a blind pianist." ...|$|E
