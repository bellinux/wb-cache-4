40|$|The article {{studies the}} role of <b>supplementary</b> {{communicative}} <b>units</b> functioning as discourse markers in analytical articles and opinion columns of modern Russian and English newspapers. The dependence of quantitative and qualitative characteristics of different <b>supplementary</b> communicative <b>units</b> on the <b>type</b> of the article and on the language is discussed. The article proves {{that the use of}} <b>supplementary</b> <b>units</b> in opinion columns in Russian and in English has more common features than in analytical articles. The highest frequency of occurrence of these units is registered in Russian analytical articles, the lowest – in English articles. In Russian newspapers analytical articles and columns demonstrate more similar characteristics than in English materials. <b>Supplementary</b> communicative <b>units</b> with organizing functions occur more frequently in Russian articles, in English articles and columns they are equally rare. Regulative <b>supplementary</b> <b>units</b> are used equally often in all analyzed newspaper texts. There is a conclusion that regulative <b>supplementary</b> <b>units</b> tend to be more universal in their use in the two languages, while organizing units show greater dependence on the language. The presented analysis of the supplementary communicative units’ use can become one of the ways to take an inventory of persuasive language means in media discourse. These units produce a productive influence on the readers, help them interpret the text adequately; enhance their attention and mental activity...|$|R

500|$|When the {{directive}} was revisited during 1977, {{some of the}} older units that were being reviewed (such as millimetre of mercury for blood pressure) were retained but others were phased out, thereby broadly aligning the allowable units with SI. The directive was however overhauled to accommodate British and Irish interests in retaining the imperial system in certain circumstances. It was reissued as directive 80/181/EEC. During subsequent revisions, {{the directive}} has reflected changes in the definition of SI. The directive also formalised the use of <b>supplementary</b> <b>units,</b> which in 1979 were permitted for a period of ten years.

50|$|In {{the area}} of {{mathematical}} logic and computer science known as <b>type</b> theory, a <b>unit</b> <b>type</b> is a type that allows only one value (and thus can hold no information). The carrier (underlying set) associated with a <b>unit</b> <b>type</b> can be any singleton set. There is an isomorphism between any two such sets, so it is customary {{to talk about the}} <b>unit</b> <b>type</b> and ignore the details of its value. One may also regard the <b>unit</b> <b>type</b> as the type of 0-tuples, i.e. the product of no types.|$|R
50|$|The game {{includes}} {{a wide range}} of different warrior squads to command and recruit. The player can lead only one squad at a time, but may take command of any squad on the field unless it is a special base defense squad, already led by another officer, or is part of a <b>unit</b> <b>type</b> that the player has not yet learned to lead. At first, the player can only lead swordsmen, archers, and mounted warriors, but can find and purchase books that will let him or her lead other <b>unit</b> <b>types.</b> <b>Unit</b> <b>types</b> vary from historical (longbowmen, men-at-arms) to anachronistic (chariots) to foreign (ninjas, camels) to fantasy (magicians). Each <b>unit</b> <b>type</b> is broken down into a number of varying subtypes; for example, the Rapier group includes shield, two-handed, and dual-wielding squads, each with their own special abilities. Each <b>unit</b> <b>type</b> has a rock-paper-scissors relationship with other <b>unit</b> <b>types.</b> When the player has an extreme advantage over an opposing <b>unit</b> <b>type,</b> a greenish-blue light will appear over the enemy squad-leader's head. A reddish shadow indicates an extreme disadvantage. For example, cavalry are very effective against swordsmen, but can be defeated easily by pikemen.|$|R
40|$|The exponential-like spatial {{correlation}} {{structure for}} hydraulic conductivity that Sudicky (1986) {{found at the}} Borden research site arises from hierarchical sedimentary architecture. The sediments {{can be described in}} terms of a hierarchy of stratal <b>unit</b> <b>types</b> wherein larger-scale <b>unit</b> <b>types</b> (hierarchical level II) are composed of smaller-scale <b>unit</b> <b>types</b> (hierarchical level I). There is a hierarchy of permeability populations corresponding to this stratal hierarchy. The shape and effective range of the composite semivariogram is mostly defined by how the proportion of lag transitions crossing these <b>unit</b> <b>types</b> grows as a function of lag distance. Lag transitions across level I units but within the same level II <b>unit</b> <b>type</b> and transitions across level II <b>unit</b> <b>types</b> contribute about equally in defining the composite sample semivariogram in the vertical direction. These two types of cross transitions have shorter and longer length scales, respectively. The composite semivariogram reflects additive contributions from the two length scales. The proportion of cross-transition lags grows with an exponential-like curve because the <b>unit</b> <b>types</b> at either level reoccur with a relatively high variability in length. The shape and range of the semivariogram are modeled from knowing only the univariate statistics for length among the <b>unit</b> <b>types,</b> and the sill is modeled from knowing univariate statistics for hydraulic conductivity populations among the <b>unit</b> <b>types.</b> Understanding the relationship between the semivariogram structure and these quantifiable attributes of the hierarchical stratal architecture helps in reducing the equivocal aspects of choosing a semivariogram model. It also helps in identifying bias in sample semivariograms and in assessing stationarity of second-order spatial bivariate statistics...|$|R

40|$|Cross-stratified {{deposits}} {{can give}} rise to a hierarchy of permeability modes, across scales, corresponding to a hierarchy of sedimentary <b>unit</b> <b>types.</b> The shape of the sample semivariogram for permeability can be largely controlled by the shape of the cross-transition probabilities of <b>unit</b> <b>types</b> having the greatest contrast in permeability. The shape of those cross-transition probabilities can be, in turn, largely determined by the variance of the lengths of those <b>unit</b> <b>types.</b> A sufficient condition for an exponential-like semivariogram is the repeated occurrence of <b>unit</b> <b>types</b> having both a contrast in permeability and a large length variance. These relationships are shown through writing the identities for spatial correlation of permeability in a hierarchical and multimodal form and {{as a function of the}} transition probabilities for the sedimentary <b>unit</b> <b>types.</b> These relationships are also illustrated through analyzing data representing cross-stratified sediments within a point bar deposit...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{focuses on}} the {{utilization}} of concatenative speech synthesis, aiming to determine and compare the influence on the synthesized speech quality when various <b>unit</b> <b>types</b> {{are used in the}} unit selection approach. There are several <b>unit</b> <b>types</b> which can be used for this purpose. This work deals with those most widely used, i. e. halfphones, diphones, phones, triphones and syllables. Speech was synthesized using these <b>unit</b> <b>types</b> and the outcome was listened to a by number of listeners, whose task was to evaluate the quality of synthetic speech. The result of the listening test performed for the Czech language is presented.

No research of a similar character has been conducted yet, so this unique evaluation should suggest what <b>unit</b> <b>types</b> are appropriate for general TTS systems.
