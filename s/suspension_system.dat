5|$|The team {{used the}} BT49 over four seasons. In the 1980 season Piquet scored three wins {{and the team}} took third in the Constructors' Championship with Piquet second in the Drivers' Championship. This season saw the {{introduction}} of the blue and white livery that the cars would wear through several changes of sponsor, until the team's demise in 1992. With a better understanding of ground effect, the team further developed the BT49C for the 1981 season, incorporating a hydropneumatic <b>suspension</b> <b>system</b> to avoid ride height limitations intended to reduce downforce. Piquet, who had developed a close working relationship with Murray, took the drivers' title with three wins, albeit amid accusations of cheating. The team finished second in the Constructors' Championship, behind the Williams team.|$|E
40|$|Abstract â€” This paper {{deals with}} a passivity-based {{approach}} to wide area stabilization of magnetic <b>suspension</b> <b>systems.</b> It {{is well known that}} the magnetic <b>suspension</b> <b>systems</b> have strong nonlinearity. In order to realize wide area stabilization of magnetic <b>suspension</b> <b>systems,</b> we design the passivity-based feedback controller considering a nonlinear dynamics of the magnetic <b>suspension</b> <b>systems</b> and a leakage inductance of the electromagnet especially. The systems can be decomposed two subsystems; an electrical subsystem and a mechanical subsystem. We design nonlinear passivity-based controllers for both two subsystems. Steady-state and transient time responses results for some operating points show the effectiveness of the proposed controller experimentally. I...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, VehicleSim multi-body {{software}} {{is used to}} extend and modify an existing motorcycle model by including different non-conventional <b>suspension</b> <b>systems.</b> Girder and Hossack double wishbones front <b>suspension</b> <b>systems</b> are designed, implemented and tested. Using a synthesis of mechanism methodology, they are designed with different kinematic configurations that allow different behaviours of the motorcycle front end. By means of CAD tools and finite element analysis, realistic three dimensional models of the <b>suspension</b> <b>systems</b> designs are developed. The dynamical properties of the mechanical assemblies are obtained from the CAD models and used to build a realistic mathematical model of a sport motorcycle fitted with theses alternative <b>suspension</b> <b>systems.</b> Dynamical and stability analyses of the alternative front <b>suspension</b> <b>systems</b> are performed. For the different kinematic configurations, anti-dive properties and variation of the motorcycle's handling geometric parameters are studied by non-linear dynamical simulations. Stability analyses are performed {{by means of the}} motorcycle linear models eigenvalues. Passive interconnection of front and rear <b>suspension</b> <b>systems</b> of a sport motorcycle is also investigated. The effects of an interconnected <b>suspensions</b> <b>system</b> on the motorcycle in-plane motions are studied by means of reduced order linear models. The baseline model is modified to include passive interconnection forces between the front and rear <b>suspension</b> <b>systems.</b> The possible improvement introduced by an interconnected <b>suspensions</b> <b>system</b> in terms of suspension accuracy is investigated through non-linear simulations with delayed step tyres inputs. Appropriate values of the interconnection passive components for different possible mechanical implementation are found by means of optimization processes. Linear stability analyses are performed for each of the different optimal interconnected configurations. Nonlinear frequency analyses of the motorcycle wheels and chassis responses are also performed considering the delay between the front and rear tyre inputs. Non-linear simulations with variable frequency sinusoidal road inputs are run for this purpose. Finally, modal analyses of the motorcycle model are carried out for variable interconnection parameters {{in order to understand the}} effect of the interconnected <b>suspensions</b> <b>system</b> on the motorcycle's motion...|$|R
50|$|This system {{provides}} many advantages over other <b>suspension</b> <b>systems.</b> For example, in solid axle <b>suspension</b> <b>systems,</b> when one wheel hits a bump, it affects both wheels. This will compromise traction, smoothness of the ride, and could also cause a dangerous wheel shimmy when moving at high speeds. With independent <b>suspension</b> <b>systems,</b> the bump primarily affects only the contacted wheel. This offers many advantages such as greater ride comfort, better traction, and safer, more stable vehicles {{on and off}} the road (Longhurst 1).|$|R
5|$|Shortly after stylists penned {{the first}} design sketches, Holden {{engineers}} {{began work on}} developing the chassis. Opel, which had {{provided the basis for}} all previous Commodore generations, ceased production of their rear-wheel drive Omega in 2003. This meant that Holden had two options: to use another GM platform, or to develop an all-new vehicle. GM's new premium rear-wheel drive Sigma platform was to see production in the 2002 Cadillac CTS. Holden's engineers were offered this platform, but decided it was not appropriate. The Sigma platform's double A-arm front suspension and extensive use of aluminium were too costly for the VE's market segment. The luggage compartment was deemed too small and the Sigma interior package could not be stretched sufficiently to become a family-sized car. In particular, the rear-seat shoulder width was too tight. These major drawbacks made Holden decide to develop an all-new platform, known as the GM Zeta platform, on which a number of forthcoming GM vehicles will also be based. The Zeta <b>suspension</b> <b>system</b> comprises new double-pivot MacPherson strut for the front and a four-link independent rear setup. These replace the previous simple MacPherson strut design front and much criticised semi-trailing arm rear suspension, for improved ride and handling.|$|E
5|$|The chassis of the C5 {{consists}} of two identical metal pressings which are joined at top and bottom with a closing plate at the rear. It lacks a separate <b>suspension</b> <b>system,</b> instead relying on the chassis structure having enough torsional flex. Its motor was produced in Italy by Polymotor, {{a subsidiary of the}} Dutch company Philips. Although it was later famously said that the C5 was powered by a washing machine motor, the motor was in fact developed from a design produced to drive a truck cooling fan. Lotus provided the gearbox and a rear axle based on a design for car steering columns. The C5's electronics were produced by MetaLab, a Sinclair spin-off. The wheels were assembled from tyres made in Taiwan and wheels from Italy. Oldham Batteries provided a lead-acid battery developed for Sinclair that could manage more than the 300 charge-discharge cycles that had originally been specified.|$|E
