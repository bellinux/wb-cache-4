It had double overhead camshafts on each cylinder bank and <b>solenoid-operated</b> magnesium two-stage variable intake manifold.

It satisfied the European Union EU3 emissions standard, and was managed by a Bosch Motronic ME 7.1.1 electronic engine control unit (ECU) with manifold-sited sequential fuel injection, mapped direct ignition with eight individual spark coils, Bosch longlife spark plugs, four heated lambda sensors and two catalytic converters, cylinder-selective knock control and a Bosch [...] "E-Gas" [...] drive by wire throttle.

5000|$|The {{line printer}} ran at 600 lines per minute, using a {{continuously}} rotating print drum technology, with letters, figures and punctuation marks distributed around the drum at each column. 132 <b>solenoid-operated</b> flat-faced print hammers comprised a print line, with ten characters to the inch. When a desired character {{arrived at the}} printing position, as indicated by timing marks {{on the end of}} the drum, a thyratron would fire and energize a print column solenoid, propelling its hammer to the back face of the printing paper. The paper would be bounced against a wide inked ribbon and against the drum, printing the desired character. The hammer would then rebound with a spring to await the next thyraton firing and the process would repeat on the next line down the sheet. Drum printers, when not adjusted properly, or due to component wear would mis-register the character vertically.|$|E
50|$|In {{the final}} version of the GWR system, the {{locomotives}} were fitted with a <b>solenoid-operated</b> valve into the vacuum train pipe, maintained in the closed position by a battery. At each distant signal, a long ramp was placed between the rails. This ramp consisted of a straight metal blade set edge-on, almost parallel to the direction of travel (the blade was slightly offset from parallel so in its fixed position it would not wear a groove into the locomotives' contact shoes), mounted on a wooden support. As the locomotive passed over the ramp, a sprung contact shoe beneath the locomotive was lifted and the battery current holding closed the brake valve was broken. In the case of a clear signal, current from a battery energising the ramp (but at opposite polarity) passed to the locomotive through the contact and maintained the brake valve in the closed position, with the reversed-polarity current ringing a bell in the cab. When the signal was at 'danger', the ramp battery was disconnected and so could not replace the locomotive's battery current: the brake valve solenoid would then be released and a horn sounded in the cab. The driver was then expected to cancel the warning and apply the brakes under his own control.|$|E

40|$|Six monkeys self-administered orally {{delivered}} phencyclidine ("angel dust") and saccharin under concurrent fixed-ratio 16 schedules during daily three-hour sessions. Liquid deliveries were {{contingent upon}} lip-contact responses on <b>solenoid-operated</b> drinking spouts. Three saccharin concentrations (0. 003 %, 0. 03 % and 0. 3 %, wt/vol) {{were tested in}} a nonsystematic order. For each saccharin concentration, the following series of phencyclidine concentrations (mg/ml) was presented: 0. 25, 0. 5, 1, 0. 25 (retest), 0. 125, 0. 0625, 0. 0312, 0. 25 (retest) and 0 (water with stimuli signaling phencyclidine). As the saccharin concentration increased, the number of drug deliveries decreased, and the peaks of the concentration-response functions were shifted to the right. The lowest saccharin concentration (0. 003 %, wt/vol) maintained responding in excess of phencyclidine levels in only one monkey. The two higher saccharin concentrations maintained behavior far in excess of phencyclidine, but saccharin deliveries decreased in some monkeys as phencyclidine concentration and intake (mg/kg) increased.

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{has been}} developed for in situ diagnostic testing of dc-actuated <b>solenoid-operated</b> valves (SOVs) by analysis {{of the characteristics of}} the transient current waveform accompanying valve actuation. This waveform, which is used to identify abnormal operation, is obtained inductively by a small split-core current transformer clamped around one of the valve`s solenoid leads. The digitized waveforms are subsequently compared with similar waveforms obtained when the valve was known to be operating normally, and the results used to detect faulty valve operation. This methodology is noninvasive because direct access to the SOV is not required; also, the current transformer has negligible effect on the solenoid current and does not require the lifting of any electrical leads. Analysis is performed by first extracting various waveform features. A subset of these features is examined by diagnostic algorithms, tuned to identify faults for that valve type, that compare the features with those obtained from a previously acquired waveform for the particular valve under examination. Two methods of analysis have been examined. One utilizes fuzzy logic in an expert system diagnostic. The other performs pattern recognition using an artificial neural network approach. The overall analysis is robust in that it can deal with minor deviations of the waveform shape experienced during repeated operation of a normal valve while successfully identifying abnormal valve operation. In the present application, analysis has been specialized to SOVs used on space-based systems; however, the methodology has sufficient flexibility to be applicable {{to a wide variety of}} valves and other industrial electrically controlled components...|$|E
40|$|<b>Solenoid-operated</b> valves (SOVs) {{are widely}} used {{components}} {{in a variety of}} industries and systems. Though they are small components, their failure can lead to catastrophic failure of the system in which they are placed. Past studies have revealed the electromagnetic coil insulation to be a weakness, and prior work in the AC motor community on twisted pairs has shown that insulation capacitance measurements can reveal useful diagnostic information. Yet, no studies have tracked the impedance spectrum over an aging/degradation period, no methods are available to identify frequencies in the impedance spectrum to be used, there discussion about how to employ coil impedance to determine a degradation mechanism, nor has there been any quantifications of the mechanical properties due to degradation. This paper develops a method of detection of the aging of insulation in low-voltage electromagnetic coils when subjected to elevated temperature environmental conditions by assessing changes in the impedance spectrum. In this experiment, a solenoid valve was powered and subjected to an operating environment equal to its maximum operating temperature. The valve was periodically removed from the temperature chamber and the impedance spectrum measured. The complex impedance was split into its real and imaginary parts and the Spearman correlation coefficient was used to find regions of interest within the impedance spectrum. The results indicate that resistance and reactance provide information that can assist in condition-based maintenance procedures for electromagnetic coils. Furthermore, mechanical properties of the insulation are investigated and reveal differences in degradation due to environmental conditions. <br type="_moz" /...|$|E

The test have been executed in the cases when the bus is stocked with an automatic hydro-mechanical transmission {{in the process of}} speed picking up, gear-changing or road braking which is assigned by accidental road humps. A computer simulation of dynamic structures in combination with virtual devices and real objects (HIL – Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulation) has been carried in the paper. Personal computers, software, programmed logic controller, frequency generator, <b>solenoid-operated</b> valve have been used for the investigation process. The paper proposes an unconventional method for improvement operational characteristics which is based on integrated control of a suspension and automatic hydro-mechanical transmission. A mathematical model includes systems of automatic transmission, suspension and module for generation of accidental road humps. The model has been considered as a basis for semi-natural laboratory bench with industrially-manufactured controller, other components of automatic systems and standard control organs.

40|$|Nanosatellites offer frequent, {{low-cost}} space {{access as}} secondary payloads on launches of larger conventional satellites. We summarize the payload {{science and technology}} of the Microsatellite in-situ Space Technologies (MisST) nanosatellite for conducting automated biological experiments. The payload (two fused 10 -cm cubes) includes 1) an integrated fluidics system that maintains organism viability and supports growth and 2) a fixed-focus imager with fluorescence and scattered-light imaging capabilities. The payload monitors temperature, pressure and relative humidity, and actively controls temperature. C. elegans (nematode, 50 m diameter x 1 mm long) was selected as a model organism due to previous space science experience, its completely sequenced genome, size, hardiness, and the variety of strains available. Three strains were chosen: two green GFP-tagged strains and one red tdTomato-tagged strain that label intestinal, nerve, and pharyngeal cells, respectively. The integrated fluidics system includes bioanalytical and reservoir modules. The former consists of four 150 L culture wells and a 4 x 5 mm imaging zone the latter includes two 8 mL fluid reservoirs for reagent and waste storage. The fluidic system is fabricated using multilayer polymer rapid prototyping: laser cutting, precision machining, die cutting, and pressure-sensitive adhesives it also includes eight <b>solenoid-operated</b> valves and one mini peristaltic pump.

40|$|Experiments are {{investigating}} the behavior of individual sand grains in the high-energy martian aeolian regime. Energy partitioning during impact of a saltating grain determines grain longevity, but it also influences {{the way in which}} the bed becomes mobilized by reptation. When single grains of sand are fired into loose beds, the bed can absorb up to 90 % of the impact energy by momentum transfer to other grains; it has been discovered that the impacting grains cause circular craters even at low impact angles. Hundreds of grains can be splashed by a single high-velocity (100 m/s) impact causing more bed disturbance through reptation than previously thought. The research is supported by NASA's PG&G Program. Because the martian aeolian environment in both high energy and of long duration, the most mobile fractions of windblown sand should have eradicated themselves by attrition, unless sand supply has kept pace with destruction. It is therefore important to understand the rate of grain attrition in order to make sense of the existence of vast dune fields on Mars. Attrition, has been addressed in other studies, but precise data for a single saltating grain striking a loose bed of sand have not been acquired [...] the quintessential case to be understood for dunes on Mars. To acquire these data, we are employing a compound crossbow which has the bolt-firing mechanism replaced with a pneumatically-automated sabot system. The sabot can launch individual grains of sand of any size between several millimeters and about 50 microns, at velocities up to 100 m/s. This is around the maximum velocity expected for saltating grains on Mars. The sabot sled is equipped with photoelectric sensors for measuring shot velocity. Baffling of the grain's exit orifice has enabled projection of single grains without significant aerodynamic effects from the sabot. Grains are fired into loose beds of sand at about 15 degrees from the horizontal (typical saltation trajectory at impact) while being filmed on high-speed video. High-intensity pulse illumination for the grains is triggered by the <b>solenoid-operated</b> bow trigger. A 45 degree mirror over the impact site provides simultaneous horizontal and vertical images of the impact on each video frame. UV fluorescence is enabling grain and grain-fragment recovery. At 100 m/s, grains of all sizes shatter into many fragments when the sand is replaced with a solid target. Kinetic energy of the grains at this velocity exceeds the critical energy for catastrophic failure of minerals. Although probably exceptional as a grain speed, it suggests that conditions on Mars might elevate materials into an attrition regime not encountered on other planets; individual grains blown across rock pavements on Mars will have short lifespans. When experimental grains impact loose (dune) sand, much, if not most of the kinetic energy is converted into momentum of other grains. Using high-speed filming, the energy involved in splashing grains at the impact site can be derived from the size of the crater, the speed of the splashed grains, and the rebound speed of the impactor. The amount of energy partitioned into material failure (as opposed to momentum) is too small a fraction of the total to be calculated under these circumstances. This does not necessarily mean that little damage occurs to the grains (the full extent of the damage has yet to be determined) because only a small fraction of the impact energy is required for inducing brittle fracture. Damage is orders of magnitude less than during impact against solid surfaces...|$|E
