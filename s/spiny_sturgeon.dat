After the {{construction}} of cascade of HPS on the Volga River and the river pollution a number of species disappeared from the fauna of the river. These include the Caspian lamprey Caspiomyzon wagneri, black backed shad Alosa kessleri, Russian sturgeon Acipenser güldenstädtii, whitefish Stenodus leucichthys leucichtys and beluga Huso huso, stellate sturgeon Acipenser stellatus and <b>spiny</b> <b>sturgeon</b> A. nudiventris.

However, during the XX century, in the river Sura several new species: Black and Caspian Sea sprat Clupeonella cultriventris, eel Anguilla anguilla, Chinese sleeper Perccottus glenii and goldfish Carassius auratus appeared. In the lower reaches, part of which is the Gulf of Cheboksary reservoir, species diversity is somewhat higher.
