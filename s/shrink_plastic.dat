5000|$|Flying models borrow {{construction}} techniques from full-sized aircraft {{although the}} use of metal is limited.

Regardless of the underlying structure, it is then skinned and subsequently doped to provide a smooth sealed surface. For light models, tissue paper is used. After it is applied, the paper is sprayed with a mist of water, which causes the paper to shrink when it dries. For larger models (usually powered and radio controlled) heat-curing or heat <b>shrink</b> covering <b>plastic</b> films or heat-shrinkable synthetic fabrics are applied to the model then heated using a hand held hair dryer, laundry iron or heat gun to tighten the material and adhere to the frame.

50|$|To further {{show their}} support of the environment, Deee-Lite pledged {{a portion of the}} album's profits to Greenpeace. Additionally, Infinity Within was the first Warner Music titles that was issued in an {{eco-friendly}} package called the Eco-pak. It was designed in 1991 by Ivy Hill Packaging, at the time a subsidiary of Time Warner, as a more environmentally friendly alternative to the longbox which was often discarded after purchase, and to facilitate proper display of CDs in music retail stores. The eco-pack was displayed in stores unfolded, to display titles {{in the same manner as}} longboxes. Upon purchasing a title and removing the <b>plastic</b> <b>shrink</b> wrap, the packaging was folded into the shape of a traditional CD jewel case, similar to a Digipak. By 1993, the use of the longbox was phased out as music retailers began replacing LP-sized sales racks with those to house jewelcase or digipak formats with the locking plastic frames (keepers); thus rendering the Eco-pak, in its original form, obsolete. As a result, Infinity Within is among the few titles ever released with the original Eco-pak design.|$|R
50|$|Their second {{full-length}} set Dial 'M' for Motherfucker, {{was released}} in 1989 and continued their formula of nihilistic guitar noise and punk rock provocation, with additional studio trickery filling out the material.

Dial M represents a move away from a simple noise formula to something more experimental. It is, for example, difficult to determine where some songs begin and end. Many sequences on the album appear to run in reverse, sometimes mid-song, seemingly for no apparent reason. Cafritz appears on some of this album but not the entirety. Dial M marks a point at which Cafritz and the band began fighting, ultimately leading to her leaving the band.|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{the effects}} of loading rate, {{material}} rate sensitivity and constraint level on quasi-static crack tip fields in a FCC single crystal are studied. Finite element simulations are performed within a mode I, plane strain modified boundary layer framework by prescribing the two term (K-T) elastic crack tip field as remote boundary conditions. The material is assumed to obey a rate-dependent crystal plasticity theory. The orientation of the single crystal is chosen so that the crack surface coincides with the crystallographic (010) plane and the crack front lies along 101] direction. Solutions corresponding to different stress intensity rates K., T-stress values and strain rate exponents m are obtained. The {{results show that the}} stress levels ahead of the crack tip increase with K. which is accompanied by gradual <b>shrinking</b> of the <b>plastic</b> zone size. However, the nature of the shear band patterns around the crack tip is not affected by the loading rate. Further, it is found that while positive T-stress enhances the opening and hydrostatic stress levels ahead of crack tip, they are considerably reduced with imposition of negative T-stress. Also, negative T-stress promotes formation of shear bands in the forward sector ahead of the crack tip and suppresses them behind the tip...|$|R
40|$|It is the {{responsibility}} of the glass container industry to supply wide mouth and narrow neck glass containers to the various glass packers and bottlers in the food and beverage industry. The majority of this glass is shipped to these packers and bottlers in a corrugated carton, normally a one dozen carton with partition. This same carton is then used to ship the filled container to the ultimate customer. However, many large packers (and bottlers) have found a better method that can significantly reduce costs. This method is referred to as bulk glass palletizing. This method entails automatically placing the closely nested glass containers on a pallet with only a chipboard sheet separating each layer. The pallet loads are then strapped and/or <b>shrink</b> wrapped in <b>plastic</b> film. While there can be some labor savings for the glass maker and packer/bottler, the major savings usually occur in permitting glass-to-glass packaging of the final product. This is simply packing the product in a tight fitting carton without partitions thus eliminating the cost of partitions and reducing the size (and cost) of the corrugated carton. However, before any packer/bottler can decide whether bulk glass palletizing is feasible, many other savings and cost factors must also be considered. It is the purpose of this article to demonstrate a method, using the decision flow process, by which this feasibility can be determined. Thesis (M. A. ...|$|R
40|$|Injection molding {{is one of}} {{the most}} common methods of mass production. After injecting molten plastic into a mold, the heat must leave the plastic material, enter the mold steel, enter the coolant, and exit the mold. This heat flow is {{critical}} to producing high quality parts rapidly. As plastic cools, the <b>plastic</b> <b>shrinks.</b> Uneven cooling causes uneven shrinkage which can cause the part to warp from the resulting internal stresses or create sink marks on the part. Thus the effect of uneven cooling is lower part quality, both in appearance and in dimension. Standard or conventional cooling channels are straight-drilled holes arranged such that they intersect and connect to form a loop for coolant, typically water, to flow through. This allows the mold to act as a heat exchanger, transferring heat to the coolant and carrying heated coolant away from the mold. While standard cooling channels have been used widely in the injection molding industry for their manufacturability and proven results, other methods have been developed for creating molds with cooling channels of any desired path or shape. These channels, called conformal due to how they conform to the shape of the part, provide uniform cooling, eliminate or reduce the quality issues of warpage and shrinkage, and provide faster, more economical cycle times. Conformal cooling is cannot be produced only by subtractive manufacturing methods that remove material from raw stock but rather through additive or hybrid manufacturing techniques that add material in layers of powder, sections, or sheets. Bonded sheet layer mold inserts can be made of any size and are currently the only feasible way of making large, conformally-cooled molds. Presented is a Six Sigma approach for implementing conformal cooling in existing molds to achieve the benefits of higher part quality and fast cycle times. Feasibility considerations include existing mold features such as slides and ejectors, choice of channel diameter, and the cooling channel path. Cost justification considerations include assessing part quality cost impact through calculation of the costs of poor quality and assessing machine capacity as relates to cycle time. With the approach presented, an injection molding company should be able to assess feasibility and cost effectiveness of implementing conformal cooling on its molds...|$|R

When the Stobart Group became listed on the stock exchange, to reflect the new ownership and {{to take advantage of a}} new wraparound <b>shrink</b> wrap adhesive <b>plastic</b> application technique, in 2000 the standard truck livery in use since 1970 of red, green and gold was refreshed, in a lighter green, and simplifying the brand name to just Eddie Stobart. This new livery became known as Modern Skin, the previous scheme becoming known as Classic Skin. In May 2007 the Stobart Group was the subject of controversy when it reportedly offered bonuses to its Carlisle-based drivers to work in Livingston in Scotland, to transport goods for Tesco who were in dispute with their distribution centre drivers and facing disruption to their supply chain. The Stobart drivers refused to cross the Livingston picket line. On 14 September 2009, MP David Taylor officially opened Stobart's Nestlé distribution centre in Bardon, Coalville, Leicestershire, after a £7 million refurbishment creating an extra 62 jobs. The new site previously owned by Innovate Logistics, at full capacity, holds 110,000 pallets, and 88,000 tonnes of goods. The hub distributes approximately 75% of Nestlé UK's deliveries of products such as Kit-Kats, Smarties and Nescafé. In July 2008 it was announced that the group had taken over the chilled and ambient goods distribution operations from the administrators of Innovate Logistics Limited, saving the jobs of around 1,300 Innovate employees. On 10 March 2008 the Stobart Group announced the acquisition of James Irlam & Sons Ltd, one of the largest independently owned road transport logistics providers in the UK for £59.9 million. On 1 April 2008 the Stobart Group (incorporating Eddie Stobart Ltd) started its first dedicated operations in Ireland, Stobart Ireland, based in Dublin, following the acquisition of TDG's Irish trailer operations.
