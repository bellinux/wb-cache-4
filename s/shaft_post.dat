40|$|Some of the {{processing}} of fresh ginger ginger market, dried ginger, preserved ginger, ginger powder, ginger oil and ginger Oleoresin. Of all {{the processing}} of ginger in the market is consumed by many people is the ginger powder, ginger powder is easier because it is processed for consumption. Currently ginger powder in the market can only produce ginger powder with a size of 50 to 60 mesh. (IPTEKnet). Therefore necessary to design a tool to grind ginger powder with a softer result with 80 to 100 mesh size, which according to the wishes of consumers. Results are expected {{in the design of}} ginger powder maker is a simple design, but can produce a fine powder. In addition ginger powder maker can help increase the productivity of small and medium industries. In carrying out this design we use is the basis of production capacity 20 kg/jam. Then determine the distance between the disc grinder. With distance is then obtained and the rpm of the motor power is needed to rotate the second disk.

25|$|Upthorpe Mill is a {{post mill}} on a {{single-storey}} roundhouse. It has {{two pairs of}} Double Patent sails carried on a wooden windshaft with a cast-iron poll end. This carries a wooden brake wheel with iron segment teeth, driving a cast-iron wallower mounted on a wooden upright shaft. The cast iron great spur wheel drives two pairs of underdrift millstones. The tail stones were driven by belt. The tail of the mill has been extended to provide room for a wire machine. The eight bladed Fantail is mounted on the rear ladder in the Suffolk style and drove both wheels by means of gears and <b>shafts.</b> The main <b>post</b> carries the inscription R Rix 1807.|$|R
5000|$|The STOVL F-35B is {{outfitted}} with the Rolls-Royce LiftSystem, designed by Lockheed Martin and developed by Rolls-Royce. This system more resembles the German VJ 101D/E than the preceding STOVL Harrier Jump Jet and the Rolls-Royce Pegasus engine. The Lift System {{is composed of}} a lift fan, drive <b>shaft,</b> two roll <b>posts</b> and a [...] "Three Bearing Swivel Module" [...] (3BSM). The 3BSM is a thrust vectoring nozzle which allows the main engine exhaust to be deflected downward at {{the tail of the}} aircraft. The lift fan is near the front of the aircraft and provides a counterbalancing thrust using two counter-rotating blisks. It is powered by the engine's low-pressure (LP) turbine via a drive shaft and gearbox. Roll control during slow flight is achieved by diverting unheated engine bypass air through wing-mounted thrust nozzles called Roll Posts.|$|R
40|$|There {{are over}} 602, 000 bridges in the United States, of which 12. 5 % are {{classified}} as functionally obsolete and 11. 2 % are structurally deficient. The functionally obsolete bridges will require expansion or replacement to increase the service capacity of the bridge. The structurally deficient bridges will either need remediation of the load carrying elements which are damaged or deteriorated or {{will need to be}} replaced completely. Replacement of the bridges means new construction; new construction means better design and quality assurance to meet the 100 + year service life requirement in place now. Rehabilitation of bridges will require better design and quality assurance to increase the current service life of the structure. This dissertation presents new design, testing, and repair methods developed to extend the life of new and existing bridges through pressure grouting, thermal integrity testing of drilled shafts, and the bond enhancement of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) repair materials bonded to concrete with vacuum bagging and pressure bagging, respectively. Pressure grouting of drilled shaft tips has been used for over five decades to improve the end bearing capacity, but no rational design procedure had ever been published until this study. The research outlined in this dissertation analyzed nine grouted shafts and compared them to standard design procedures to determine the improvement in end bearing. Improvements ranged from 60 % to 709 % increase in end bearing capacity. From these improvements, a design procedure was developed for pressure grouted drilled <b>shafts.</b> <b>Post</b> construction inspection of drilled shafts relies largely on non-visual techniques dealing with measured concrete quantities, acoustic wave speed or frequency, gamma radiation attenuation and now the internal temperature of the curing concrete. Thermal Integrity Profiling (TIP), developed at USF, utilizes the heat of hydration of curing concrete to evaluate the concrete cover, foundation shape, cage alignment, and concrete mix design performance. This research developed standard test equipment and procedures for thermal integrity testing. Comparing the results of the different types of integrity tests is difficult due to the varied nature of the different tests. The dissertation looked at various shafts constructed across the nation which were tested with thermal and at least one other integrity test method. When compared to acoustic and gamma radiation test results, TIP agreed with 4 of 6 cases for acoustic and 2 of 5 cases using gamma radiation. In the one case were both sonic caliper and inclination data were available, TIP showed good agreement. Vacuum bagging and pressure bagging are techniques for improving the FRP-concrete bond in the repair of partially submerged piles. Prototype vacuum bagging and pressure bagging systems were developed and bond improvement assessed from results of pullout tests on full size piles repaired under simulated tidal exposures in the laboratory. Pressure bagging gave better bond and was found to be simpler because it did not require an airtight seal. A field demonstration project was conducted in which pressure bagging was used in combination with two different glass FRP systems to repair two corroding piles supporting the Friendship Trails Bridge across Tampa Bay. Inspection of the post-cured wrap showed no evidence of air voids...|$|R
40|$|The bump {{at the end}} of {{the bridge}} and the high cost of deep {{embedded}} drilled shafts have long been recognized by many bridge owners. This research aims to mediate the bump {{at the end of}} the bridge and to validate the use of post grouting to increase drilled shaft capacity. Performance monitoring and full scale test programs were used to evaluate these technical issues. The bump {{at the end of the}} bridge is typically due to settlement of the approach soils and cracking of the approach pavements. The settlement and cracking in integral abutment bridges are typically dealt with by connecting the approach slab to the integral abutment bridge. Two integral abutment bridges with integrally connected precast approach slabs were evaluated using long-term monitoring systems to study their structural performance and determine the range of forces that should be considered when designing such approach slabs. This study has identified design and construction considerations for integrally connected precast approach slabs. The approach slab study revealed the source and magnitude of forces to be considered in the design and construction of approach slabs integrally connected to integral abutment bridges. Consideration of these forces in the design and construction of such approach slabs could potentially lead to reduced maintenance costs associated with the bump at the end of the bridge. The required deep embedment length of drilled shafts is due to the inability to fully mobilize the end bearing resistance of the shaft before reaching service displacement criteria. Post grouting of drilled shafts can be used to effectively increase the end bearing capacity within service displacement limits, often times allowing the drilled shaft to be shortened without sacrificing capacity. Through a load test program and long-term performance monitoring of production shafts, the increase in capacity and performance of <b>post</b> grouted drilled <b>shafts</b> were investigated. This study has identified design and construction considerations for <b>post</b> grouted drilled <b>shafts.</b> The <b>post</b> grouted drilled <b>shaft</b> study verified the use of post grouting as a technique for increasing the end bearing resistance of drilled shafts and also identified design and construction considerations for <b>post</b> grouted drilled <b>shafts.</b> Increasing the end bearing resistance of drilled shafts through the use of post grouting can effectively allow the shafts to be shortened without losing capacity or exceeding service displacement criteria; potentially leading to reduced costs for bridge projects...|$|R
