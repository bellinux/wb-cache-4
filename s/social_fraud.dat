40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the representation}} of <b>social</b> security <b>fraud</b> in the UK's Department for Work and Pensions' (DWP) television advertising campaign between 2000 and 2004. The article discusses the campaign {{in the context of}} New Labour's concerns with <b>social</b> security <b>fraud</b> and observes that the ostensible aim of the television advertisements was to deter <b>social</b> security <b>fraud.</b> The article then moves on to discuss the difficulties of the advertising campaign in meeting this aim in the context of what is known about the nature of <b>social</b> security <b>fraud.</b> Since the 1970 s, the mass media in the UK has been fascinated by <b>social</b> security <b>fraud</b> (Golding and Middleton, 1982; Golding, 1999). However, since the year 2000 there has been a further media representation of social security fraud; the anti-fraud advertisement. Despite recent literature commenting on 'fraud in the public domain' (Sainsbury, 2003, pp 290 – 92) the anti-fraud advertisements have received no analytical attention. This article addresses this issue by focusing on the 'Targeting fraud' and the 'We're onto you' television advertisements. These advertisements were part of a campaign that also involved newspaper, poster and radio advertisements, but there is not enough space here to analyse these other types of advertisements. This article outlines the New Labour government's concerns with <b>social</b> security <b>fraud</b> and locates the television advertising campaign in relation to them. The article goes on to offer a textual analysis of the advertisements, focusing on the theme of deterring <b>social</b> security <b>fraud,</b> before critically engaging with the advertisements by focusing on their representation of <b>social</b> security <b>fraud</b> and the potential of the advertisements to deter fraudulent activity...|$|R

40|$|For decades, {{provisions}} of Belgian social criminal law were scattered among various pieces of social legislation. When the Social Criminal Code was implemented in June 2010, these provisions were {{made into a}} new, coherent system, meant to improve the readability of social criminal law, consequently precluding errors and legal uncertainties. Today, knowledge of social criminal law is key not only nationally speaking, {{but more and more}} in a cross-border, European context as well. Opening up the social criminal law framework in Europe and spreading information about the different social criminal law provisions within the European Union Member States, is one of the fundamental objectives of IRIS│international research institute on <b>social</b> <b>fraud</b> at Ghent University.

40|$|This article {{presents}} an econometric model of <b>social</b> <b>fraud</b> contributions which {{takes into account}} the process of monitoring and detection. The introduction of these two processes in the model allows to correct two important biases and so propose an unbiased fraud estimation. The first bias is inherent to data from ?selective? controls of contributors assumed to be more likely fraudulent. The second is related to the possible failure in detection of the entire fraud during inspections. The estimates are based on individual data of small and medium enterprises of the Lyon metropolitan area, drawn from the confidential database of the social security administration. Our results confirm that the selection bias leads to over-estimate fraud, while the detection bias tends to underestimate fraud. According to our results, in the absence of correction of these two biases, fraud would be over-estimated of approximately 13 %. Classification JEL : C 34, D 81, H 26, J 22. ...|$|E
40|$|Proliferation of {{e-commerce}} and {{the advent}} of social media utilization have contributed to the significant progress of social commerce around the world. Similar to existing internet applications for businesses, such as conventional e-commerce and mobile commerce, interactions and socialization on online medium (with less visibility of sellers and buyers physical presence) over the social media also possess risks of unreliable and fraudulent transactions. Despite the informed risks of online dealings, fraudulent social commerce incidents are growing. While the existing literature on social commerce provided insights on social commerce development in terms of its advantages and adoption, dearth of studies offer understanding of the dark side of social commerce, particularly with regards to the occurrence of <b>social</b> commerce <b>frauds.</b> This proposed qualitative study intends to bridge this gap, with the focus to examine the occurrence {{and the nature of the}} <b>social</b> commerce <b>fraud,</b> and consequently to understand how and why shoppers become victims of <b>social</b> commerce <b>fraud.</b> Findings are expected to contribute towards conceptual understanding of <b>social</b> commerce <b>fraud</b> phenomenon and offer inputs to increase awareness among social commerce community...|$|R

The primary goal in <b>social</b> security <b>fraud</b> is to detect companies that intentionally fail to pay their contributions to the government. We aim to detect fraudulent companies by (1) propagating a time-dependent exposure score for each node based on its relationships to known fraud in the network; (2) deriving cliques of companies and resources, and labeling these cliques in terms of their fraud and bankruptcy involvement; and (3) characterizing each company using a combination of intrinsic and relational features and its membership in suspicious cliques. We show that clique-based features boost the performance of traditional relational models. status: publishe...|$|R
