40|$|The Council of Europe is a European {{international}} organisation {{with the aim}} to promote the cooperation of its member states {{on the basis of}} democracy, respect for human rights and the state of law. Until 1989 its membership was confined to the Western European states. Soon {{after the collapse of the}} Warsaw Pact in 1989, the first Eastern European states applied for membership. Since 1989, the membership of the Council of Europe has enlarged from 23 to now 44 states. The application for membership of the Eastern European countries, part of which did not fulfil the standards developed by the Council of Europe in the field of democracy, respect for human rights and the state of law, were highly controversially discussed within the Council of Europe, in particular in the case of Russia. The organisation finally decided to admit all "European" states, but only on condition of certain obligations and commitments to be undertaken by the applicant states. Thereby the organisation wanted to support the transformation process from within the organisation. This dissertation analyses the particular problems arising out of the wide admission policy. Chapter 2, after the Introduction, gives an overview of the history of the organisation, its relations with the Eastern European states until 1989 and an analysis of the most important issues for the organisation in its attempt to define its role after 1989. The introduction of the special guest status and the different stages in the discussion about the admission policy are analysed with respect to the individual admission candidates. Additionally the position of the Council of Europe in juxtaposition to other {{international organisation}}s such as the OSCE and the EU is examined with regard to their particular comparative advantages and disadvantages. Chapter 3 gives an analysis of the institutional changes within the organisation, with particular attention to the new organ "Council of Local and Regional Authorities", the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights and the commission "Democracy through Law". The central chapter 4 examines the different monitoring procedures within the Council of Europe, part of which had existed before (especially the European Court for Human Rights) whereas others were introduced in the context of the Eastern European states´ admission. The analysis focusses on the monitoring procedure introduced by the Parliamentary Assembly, which presents an innovative approach to ensure the fulfillment of the commitments entered into by the new member states. In addition to the monitoring procedures, <b>special</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> (the so-called ADACS programmes) were introduced by the Council of Europe (chapter 4). The interplay of these different mechanisms is examined in two case studies (chapter 5). The case of Estonia is a positive example for the efficacy of the Council of Europe´s approach, whereas the steps taken by the organisation in reaction to the conflicts in the Russian Republic of Chechnya illustrate the limits of its capacity to act and react...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} 15 years, the Government of Indonesia has {{implemented}} {{a variety of}} social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> intended {{to improve the lives of}} the poor and help them escape poverty. Many of these programmes are now operating at a national scale and cover millions of Indonesians. Using a new household survey dataset that covers the eastern areas of Indonesia (Indonesian Family Life Survey East 2012), this paper investigates the household-level determinants of access to social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes.</b> The analysis reveals that social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> are relatively more available in poorer provinces and that poorer households—all things being equal—are more likely to access social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> than nonpoor households, which suggests that social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> in eastern Indonesia are successful in their efforts to target the poor (poverty targeting), both across regions and households. However, poverty targeting still has scope for improvement in terms of accuracy. Besides the poverty status (as measured in per capita consumption expenditures), the authors found that several other factors infl uence programme access. Having a disabled household member or having a household head who is a widow(er) appears to increase the likelihood of receiving social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes.</b> Likewise, the level of trust and confl ict in a community affects access to social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes.</b> Particularly in the case of Raskin, we found that the programme is distributed more widely among those communities that are characterized by higher levels of confl ict and lower levels of trust. The authors did not fi nd that poor access to infrastructure and remoteness infl uences household access to social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> once they controlled for province fi xed effects in the regression framework. Furthermore, the fi ndings suggest that possession of a local ‘poverty letter’ strongly improves household access to social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes,</b> even after controlling for a wide set of socioeconomic characteristics.

These ILs were investigated for their application as electrolyte with a ZnFe 2 O 4 nanoflake-based supercapacitor electrode; they exhibited significantly better performance {{than any other}} previously reported ILs used as electrolytes. [BMIM][SCN] showed higher specific capacitance (781 Fg(- 1)), cycle stability (95 % retention, 3000 cycle), and energy density (156 Whkg(- 1)) than [EMIM][SCN] (590 Fg(- 1), 86 % retention, and 78 Whkg(- 1)) and [MIM][SCN] (250 Fg(- 1), 80 % retention, and 50 Whkg(- 1)). The ZnFe 2 O 4 nanoflake electrodes were able to deliver an energy density of 156 Whkg(- 1) even at an extra high power density of 7. 11 kWkg(- 1) in [BMIM][SCN] electrolyte, justifying its utility as a potential electrolyte. Furthermore, the effect of how the hydrated ions of the ILs in aqueous media influence the overall performance of the supercapacitor was studied systematically and found to be contrary to the reported trend and use of pure ILs as electrolytes.

40|$|A fim de avaliar o resultado da gestação em pacientes cardíacas foram considerados dois grupos controle: o grupo Ïöu clínico e o grupo ÏIöu cirúrgico. Foram considerados para este estudo todas as pacientes reumáticas matriculadas no Programa de Assistência à Gestante Cardíaca, no período de 01 / 06 / 15 a 30 / 10 / 79, tomando-se por base a gravidez e a doença reumática como ponto comum a todas as pacientes. Os resultados obtidos nestas gestações estão baseados nos parâmetros a seguir relacionados: idade da paciente no início da gestação, número de gestações, paridade, diagnóstico clínico-cardiológico, tipo funcional segundo a N̈ew York Heart Association,̈ idade gestacional, eletrocardiograma, tipo de parto, peso do recém-nascido ao nascer e suas condições de saúde. As pacientes do grupo ÏIöu cirúrgico foram divididas em três subgrupos a saber: cirúrgico 1 ̈(̈submetidas a comissurotomia valvar); cirúrgico 2 ̈(̈submetidas a implante de prótese valvar-metálica tipo Starr-Edwards; e cirúrgico 3 ̈(̈submetida a implante de prótese biológica de dura-máter). Os filhos das gestantes do grupo ÏIöu cirúrgico têm peso significativamente menor que os filhos das gestantes do grupo Ïöu clínico. Entre as pacientes dos subgrupos cirúrgicos os filhos das pacientes com prótese de Starr-Edwards têm peso menor do que os filhos das gestantes dos outros subgrupos cirúrgicos, o que pode, pelo menos em parte, ser explicado pela ação dos anticoagulantes orais. Em relação ao tipo funcional, as pacientes cardíacas reumáticas clínicas podem engravidar se estiverem classificadas nos tipos funcionais I e II da N̈ew York Heart Association,̈ enquanto que as do grupo cirúrgico, com qualquer tipo de procedimento cirúrgico anterior, só poderão engravidar se pertencerem ao tipo funcional I, sem história de descompensação cardíaca anterior. As pacientes com prótese de Starr-Edwards na vigência de anticoagulação oral, devem ser bem orientadas em relação aos riscos do uso de tal medicação e entrarem para o programa especial de acompanhamento, com emprego de heparina subcutânea, principalmente durante a organogênese e ao controle rigoroso do tempo de protrombina, para prevenir o aparecimento de fenômenos trómboembólicos e do síndrome warfarínico fetal. As pacientes com prótese de dura-máter aórtica devem ser desencorajadas a engravidar. O período ideal para uma gravidez em pacientes cardíacas reumáticas, após qualquer tipo de cirurgia cardíaca, é com duração {{superior}} a 1 ano e inferior a 6 anos de pós-operatório. O maior número de cesáreas foi uma constante em todos os grupos estudados e realizadas por indicação obstétrica. No cirúrgico 2 ̈(̈ou com prótese de Starr-Edwards) há indicação relativa de parto programado devido ao uso de anticoagulantes orais. Os procedimentos cirúrgicos devem ser realizados preferentemente antes ou apÓs a gestação. Durante o período gestacional,a época teoricamente ïdealé̈ entre a 18 a. e 24 a. semanas de gestação, ou em qualquer fase da gestação quando este for um procedimento de urgência. A cardioversão elétrica, processo inócuo durante a gravidez pode ser realizado em qualquer período gestacional para reversão da fibrilação atrial a ritmo sinusal. A taxa de óbitos maternos nas 301 gestações estudadas foi de 1, 66 por cento, sendo que houve diferença significativa entre as proporções de óbitos nos dois grupos ÏëÏI. ̈ As perdas do produto conceptual foram significativamente menores no grupo Ïöu clínico (4, 48 por cento) do que no grupo ÏIöu cirúrgico (12, 39 por cento). Os resultados obtidos permitiram melhor avaliação dos riscos cardiológico e gravídico, bem como possibilitaram a caracterização de diferentes parâmetros que, considerados em conjunto, serão fundamentais para a avaliação do prognóstico destas mulheres com cardiopatia reumática. With {{a view to}} {{assessing the}} consequences of pregnancy in rheumatic heart patients this study considered two control groups: the clinical group (I) and the surgical group (II). All the rheumatic patients enrolled, {{during the period from}} June 1, 1975 to October 3 O, 1979, in the P̈rogramme of Assistance to the Cardiac pregnant Womanẅere included in this study. Pregnancy and rheumatic disease were the common factors in all the cases studied. The results obtained during these pregnancies are based on the following parameters: age of the patient at the beginning of pregnancy, number of pregnancies, parity, cardiological clinical diagnosis, functional type according to the N̈ew York Heart Association,̈ gestational age, electrocardiogram, type of birth, birth-weight and state of health of the babies. The patients of Group ÏI(̈Surgical) were divided into three sub-groups, namely: Surgical 1 ̈(̈composed of those who had undergone Valvotomy); Surgical 2 ̈(̈who had undergone implant of the Starr-Edwards heart valve prosthesis) and Surgical 3 ̈(̈who had undergone implant of the d̈ura-materällograft prosthesis). The children of the mothers of group II (Surgical) were found to be of considerably lower weight than the children of mothers of group I (Clinical). With regard to the patients of the surgical sub-groups, the children of those with Starr-Edwards prosthesis are of lower weight than the children of the patients of the other surgical sub-groups which can be accounted for, at least in some measure, {{as a result of the}} use of oral anticoagulants. With regard to the functional type, theclinical rheumatic heart patients may become pregnant if classified as of the functional types I and II of the N̈ew York Heart Association,̈ while those of the surgical group, with any kind of earlier surgical treatment, may only become pregnant if they belong to the functional type I, with no previous history of cardiac insufficiency. The patients with Starr-Edwards prosthesis must be fully advised about the risks of using oral anticoagulants and must be put onto a <b>special</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>programme,</b> with employment of intradermic heparin, especially during organogenesis. They must also be advised about the necessary rigorous control of the prothrombine time to guard against the appearance of thromboembolic problems and Warfarin embryopathy. Patients with aortic d̈ura-materp̈rosthesis should be discouraged from becoming pregnant. The most favorable period for pregnancy in rheumatic heart patients with any kind of cardiac surgical history is that lasting from a minimum of one year to a maximum of six years after operation. A majority of births by ceasarean section was a constant in all groups studied these were carried out on the basis of the obstetricianś recommendation. In the surgical sub-group 2 ̈(̈those with Starr-Edwards prosthesis) there is a relatively high probability of programm d births due to the use of oral anticoagulants. Surgery ought to be carried out, preferably, either before of after pregnancy. During the period of pregnancy the theoretically ideal occasion for surgery is between the 18 th and 24 th. weeks of pregnancy or, at any time during the pregnancy in urgent cases. Electrical cardioversion is a harmless procedure for the expectant mother and may be carried out at any time during the pregnancy for the reversal of the atrial fibrilation to the sinus rhythm. The maternal death rate for the 301 pregnancies studied was of 1. 66 per cent, though there was a significant difference between the proportion of deaths occuring in groups I and II. The loss of the conceptual product was significantly less in Group I (clinical) 4. 48 per cent than in Group II (surgical) 12. 39 per cent. The result obtained permitted a better assessment of the cardiological and pregnancy risks, as well as making possible the characterization of the different parameters which, considered as a group, will be fundamental to the assessment of the prognosis of women with rheumatic heart disease...|$|E

Through the community recovery framework, social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes,</b> with active collaboration and interaction between the community and the social assistants, can speed up community recovery efforts; contributing to the disaster recovery management. The Law of the Republic of Indonesia Number 11 of 2009 and Regulation of the Ministry of Social of the Republic of Indonesia Number 82 of 2006 set out and guide the social assistance delivery to the community. However, most of the literature addressing social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes,</b> following a disaster in Indonesia, is from the government?s perspective, the legislation outlook and the social assistants? point of view. Little is known about the benefit and practice of the social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> from the perspectives of the affected community.
