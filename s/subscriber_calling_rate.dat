50|$|Before DACS, WB900 (a 1 + 1 {{analogue}} carrier system) was used. The first <b>subscriber's</b> phone (<b>called</b> the 'audio customer') {{would be}} connected as normal. The second <b>subscriber</b> (<b>called</b> the 'carrier customer') {{would have his}} phone calls modulated on to an RF carrier or Carrier wave on the same physical phone line at around 40 kHz - high enough not to be noticeable to the audio customer.|$|R
50|$|Until {{the early}} 1980s, this {{situation}} was often {{dealt with by}} providing shared or 'party' lines, which were connected to multiple customers. This raised privacy problems since any subscriber connected to the line could listen to (or indeed, interrupt) another <b>subscriber's</b> <b>call.</b>|$|R

50|$|Telus Canada began {{offering}} a telephone service called Tigits across Canada in early 2011. Tigits provides a temporary anonymous telephone number {{for those who}} subscribe to the service. Developed by Toronto businessman, Sean Miller, Tigits allows the subscriber to protect his/her real number by giving the temporary Tigits number to others. When a Tigits <b>subscriber</b> <b>calls</b> the other person, the person called sees only the Tigits number on his digital display and not the real number of the person calling. When the other person calls the Tigits number of the Tigits <b>subscriber</b> the <b>call</b> is forwarded to the real number of the Tigits subscriber, thus protecting his/her anonymity.|$|R
5000|$|The Tel-musici was {{an early}} {{entertainment}} innovation, which used telephone lines to transmit phonograph recordings to individual households. <b>Subscribers</b> <b>called</b> a central [...] "music room" [...] to request selections, which they listened to at home over specially designed loudspeakers called [...] "magnaphones".

50|$|When {{telephone}} {{systems were}} first introduced, <b>subscribers</b> <b>called</b> a telephone exchange and asked a human operator {{to connect the}} <b>call</b> to another <b>subscriber</b> on the same exchange; calls to other exchanges were originally not possible. Later it became possible to dial numbers on the same exchange; calls to other exchanges (trunk calls) were possible, but had to be connected by an operator. When subscribers in one area became able to dial non-local subscribers, the term used for the innovation was subscriber trunk dialling.|$|R
40|$|Question: Is sexual {{signalling}} (courtship <b>call</b> <b>rate)</b> {{determined by}} physiological fitness (energy metabolism at rest), endurance during physically demanding activity, {{an aspect of}} immune defence (lytic activity) or body mass? Organism: Pedigree laboratory population of decorated crickets (Gryllodes sigillatus). Methods: Behavioural trial of male courtship <b>call</b> <b>rate</b> and measurements of males’ physiological performance. Covariance analysis exploring the determinants of courtship <b>call</b> <b>rate.</b> Results: We found that endurance was strongly positively associated with the courtship <b>call</b> <b>rate.</b> However, neither the lytic activity nor the resting metabolic rate correlated with courtship <b>call</b> <b>rate.</b> Together with body mass and family effects, endurance explained over 77 % {{of the variance in}} courtship <b>call</b> <b>rate.</b> Hence, only physically fit individuals can perform sexual displays well...|$|R

50|$|There are {{signals that}} {{indicate}} when a subscriber {{has picked up}} the telephone, {{when he or she}} can start to dial a number, and when another <b>subscriber</b> <b>calls,</b> as well as signals that let the communication link be maintained, and so on. In the E1 PCM system, signaling information can be transmitted by two different methods: the common channel signaling (CCS) method and the channel associated signaling (CAS) method. In both cases, the time slot TS16 of the basic 2 Mbit/s frame is used to transmit the signaling information.|$|R
40|$|We {{explore the}} inter-temporal linkage between <b>call</b> <b>rate</b> changes, {{consumer}} price index (CPI) changes, and real gross domestic product (GDP) changes in Japan based on the Taylor rule of monetary policy. In our analysis, we consider two sample periods, namely, the former is before zero-interest rate policy and the latter is after it. According to our empirical results, first, {{we find that the}} relations between <b>call</b> <b>rate</b> changes and GDP changes and those between <b>call</b> <b>rate</b> changes and CPI changes are weak before zero-interest rate policy. Second, we also find that after zero-interest rate policy, mutual inter-temporal relations between <b>call</b> <b>rate</b> changes and GDP changes are seen as the US Taylor rule suggests, although the linkage between <b>call</b> <b>rate</b> changes and CPI changes is not seen. Hence after zero-interest <b>rate</b> policy, regarding <b>call</b> <b>rates</b> and GDP, the relations suggested by US Taylor rule are found in Japan...|$|R

50|$|Each {{subscriber}} in an MPT-1327 trunked {{radio network}} {{has a unique}} call number. This call number (address) is a compound number consisting of a prefix (three digits), the fleet number and the <b>subscriber's</b> <b>call</b> number within the fleet. Different numbering schemes work differently, for example Zetron uses the first two digits of the Ident as the fleet number, and the last two digits as the unit number. Idents in the 6,000-6,999 range are typically used to establish group calls. After it has been entered the call number will be converted in the mobile to a 20-bit address. The numbering rules are clarified and expanded by supplementary standards such as MPT-1343.|$|R
5000|$|In {{circuit-switched}} networks, such as {{the public}} switched telephone network (PSTN), it is desirable to transmit multiple <b>subscriber</b> <b>calls</b> over the same transmission medium to effectively utilize the bandwidth of the medium. [...] TDM allows transmitting and receiving telephone switches to create channels (tributaries) within a transmission stream. A standard DS0 voice signal has a data bit rate of 64 kbit/s. A TDM circuit runs at a much higher signal bandwidth, permitting the bandwidth to be divided into time frames (time slots) for each voice signal which is multiplexed onto the line by the transmitter. If the TDM frame consists of n voice frames, the line bandwidth is n*64 kbit/s.|$|R

25|$|A {{telephone}} exchange is a telephone system located at service centers (central offices) {{responsible for a}} small geographic area that provided the switching or interconnection {{of two or more}} individual <b>subscriber</b> lines for <b>calls</b> made between them, rather than requiring direct lines between subscriber stations.

40|$|<b>Call</b> <b>rate</b> can be {{a salient}} feature in animal communication. Depending on the species, {{different}} psychological variables appear to influence <b>call</b> <b>rates</b> but {{the exact nature of}} these relationships remains poorly explored. Here, we demonstrate for free-ranging Campbell's monkeys that the <b>call</b> <b>rates</b> of four different alarm series (termed H, K, K +, and B series) vary systematically as a function of context, associated behaviour, and identity of the caller. K + series were given more rapidly to predation than non- predation events, K + and K series more rapidly to visual than auditory predator detection, and H series more rapidly while counterattacking an eagle than staying put. Finally, there were individual differences in B series, suggesting that <b>call</b> <b>rate</b> potentially provides listeners with cues about the caller's anti-predator behaviour, event type experienced, and his identity...|$|R

40|$|Estimating {{numbers of}} whales present {{in an area}} from {{recorded}} <b>call</b> <b>rates</b> could be a useful conservation tool. We recorded southern right whale Eubalaena australis vocalisations and presence in Walker Bay on the south coast of South Africa. In all, 45 sessions with synchronous acoustic and visual data were analysed to determine <b>call</b> <b>rates</b> directly (overall <b>call</b> <b>rate,</b> OCR) and {{in relation to the}} number of whales sighted (<b>call</b> <b>rate</b> per whale, CPW) and number of groups sighted (<b>call</b> <b>rate</b> per group, CPG). The OCRs were examined in the presence of varying numbers of whales, using a log-linear model to investigate the dependence of the <b>call</b> <b>rate</b> on whale density. The number of whales present exerted a strong quadratic effect on the OCR, which peaked at around 15 whales and decreased to a low rate as whale presence approached a maximum, for all calls combined and for four of their constituent 13 call types: a quadratic trend was present to varying degrees among the remaining call types. Both quadratic and linear trends were absent when OCR was assessed against number of groups present, possibly because group size increased with increasing density of whales. A linear regression on the CPW and CPG suggested that there was a negative inverse relationship with the number of whales and groups present respectively. These findings are important in that, while they preclude the estimation of absolute numbers from <b>call</b> <b>rates,</b> they imply that, under the conditions prevailing in Walker Bay, southern right whales were aware of the presence, arrival and departure of other animals in their vicinity and adjusted their vocal behaviour accordingly.
