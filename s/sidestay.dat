This takes longer than a folding system but is typically lighter and less costly, and can also be used for craft with too much beam for a folding system. For example, the small modern Weta Trimaran uses tubes to connect the floats to the main hull, which are lashed in from a canvas trampoline and further held in place by the <b>sidestays.</b> Similarly, the original Dragonfly Trimarans (Dragonfly 600) and the home built W22 use this design.|$|R

A motivation for this study is the desire to understand the underlying nonlinear behaviour, which may prevent a dual-sidestay landing gear from downlocking under certain conditions. The model formulates the mechanism as a set of steady-state constraint equations. Solutions to these equations are then continued numerically in state and parameter space, providing all state parameter dependencies within the model from a single computation. The capability of this analysis approach is demonstrated with an investigation into the effects of the aft <b>sidestay</b> angle on retraction actuator loads. It was found that the retraction loads are not significantly affected by the <b>sidestay</b> plane angle, but the landing gear’s ability to be retracted fully is impeded at certain <b>sidestay</b> plane angles. This result is attributed to the landing gear’s geometry, as the locklinks are placed under tension and cause the mechanism to lock. <b>Sidestay</b> flexibilities and attachment point deflections are then introduced to enable the downlock loads to be investigated. The investigation into the dual sidestay’s downlock sensitivity to attachment point deflections yields an underlying double hysteresis loop, which is highly sensitive to these deflections. Attachment point deflections of a few millimetres were found to prevent the locklinks from automatically downlocking under their own weight, hence requiring some external force to downlock the landing gear. <b>Sidestay</b> stiffness was also found to influence the downlock loads, although not to the extent of attachment point deflection. ...|$|E

40|$|Current {{landing gear}} {{mechanism}} analysis methods focus on determining purely geometric behaviour of the retraction mechanism, {{to ensure that}} the landing gear will meet its stowed constraints. For detailed analysis work, dynamic simulation is the standard method to determine underlying causes of nonlinear behaviour. The work presented in this thesis provides an alternative analysis approach for analysing quasi-static landing gear mechanisms, to be used to complement and inform the use of dynamic simulations. This alternative method of investigating quasi-static mechanisms is first presented for two planar mechanism example cases: an overcentre mechanism and a nose landing gear mechanism. The method uses static equilibrium equations along with equations describing the geometric constraints in the mechanism. In the spirit of bifurcation analysis, solutions to these steady-state equations are then continued numerically in parameters of interest. Results obtained from the numerical continuation agree with the equivalent results obtained from two overcentre mechanism dynamic models, whilst offering a considerable computation time reduction. The analysis performed with the nose landing gear model demonstrates the flexibility of the continuation approach, allowing conventional model states to be used as continuation parameters without a need to reformulate the equations within the model. The modelling approach is then demonstrated for the case of non-planar landing gear mechanisms, with application to a three-dimensional aircraft main landing gear mechanism model. A design case-study is performed on the landing gear actuator position to demonstrate the potential industrial relevance of the method. The trade-off between maximal efficiency and peak actuator force reduction when positioning the actuator is investigated. The problem formulation allows actuator force, length and efficiency information to be obtained from a single numerical continuation run with minimal data post-processing. Finally, a model of a dual <b>sidestay</b> landing gear mechanism is, presented and used to investigate the mechanism downlock sensitivity to attachment point deflections. Motivation for this study is provided by a desire to understand the underlying nonlinear behaviour that may prevent a dual <b>sidestay</b> landing gear from down- locking under certain conditions. An investigation into the effect of <b>sidestay</b> angle reveals that the geometry prevents the gear from fully retracting at certain <b>sidestay</b> angles. <b>Sidestay</b> flexi- bilities are then introduced to enable the downlock loads to be investigated. It is demonstrated that deflections of even a few milimetres can provide a force barrier to the landing gear down- locking. The underlying nonlinear behaviour is attributed to the formation of double hysteresis loop in the force-locklink angle plane. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The final {{publication}} {{is available}} at Springer via [URL] method of investigating quasi-static landing gear mechanisms is presented and applied to a three-dimensional aircraft main landing gear mechanism model. The model has 19 static equilibrium equations and 20 equations describing the geometric constraints in the mechanism. In the spirit of bifurcation analysis, solutions to these 39 steady-state equations are found and tracked, or continued, numerically in parameters of interest. A design case-study is performed on the land-ing gear actuator position to demonstrate the potential relevance of the method for industrial applications. The trade-off between maximal efficiency and peak actuator force reduction when positioning the actuator is investigated. It is shown that the problem formulation is very flexible and allows actuator force, length and efficiency information to be obtained from a single numerical continuation computation with minimal data post-processing. The study suggests that numerical continuation analysis has potential for investigating even more complex landing gear mechanisms, such as those {{with more than one}} <b>sidestay...</b>|$|E
