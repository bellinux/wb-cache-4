5|$|Daniela Schwarz {{and colleagues}} (2007) {{concluded}} that the bifurcated neural spines of diplodocids and dicraeosaurids enclosed an air sac, {{which would have been}} connected to the lungs as part of the respiratory system. In Dicraeosaurus, this air sac (the so-called supravertebral diverticulum) would have rested on top of the neural arch and filled the entire <b>space</b> <b>between</b> the spines. In Amargasaurus the upper two-thirds of the spines would have been covered by a sheath of keratin, restricting the air sac to the <b>space</b> <b>between</b> the lower one-third of the spines.|$|E

50|$|Irish monks {{introduced}} <b>spacing</b> <b>between</b> {{words in}} the 7th century. This facilitated reading, as these monks tended to be less familiar with Latin. However, the use of <b>spaces</b> <b>between</b> words did not become commonplace before the 12th century.

5|$|As he {{indicated}} in the title, Kepler thought he had revealed God's geometrical plan for the universe. Much of Kepler's enthusiasm for the Copernican system stemmed from his theological convictions about {{the connection between the}} physical and the spiritual; the universe itself was an image of God, with the Sun corresponding to the Father, the stellar sphere to the Son, and the intervening <b>space</b> <b>between</b> to the Holy Spirit. His first manuscript of Mysterium contained an extensive chapter reconciling heliocentrism with biblical passages that seemed to support geocentrism.|$|E

50|$|It {{was common}} for early word {{processing}} systems to use monospaced fonts, and packages designed for these systems often allowed text to be justified by inserting extra <b>spaces</b> <b>between</b> {{words in the}} shorter lines.

5|$|Cargo {{shifting}} poses a {{great danger}} for bulkers. The problem {{is even more}} pronounced with grain cargoes, since grain settles during a voyage and creates extra <b>space</b> <b>between</b> {{the top of the}} cargo and the top of the hold. Cargo is then free to move {{from one side of the}} ship to the other as the ship rolls. This can cause the ship to list, which, in turn, causes more cargo to shift. This kind of chain reaction can capsize a bulker very quickly.|$|E
5|$|Consonants and vowel {{segments}} {{combine to}} form syllables, {{which in turn}} combine to form utterances; these can be distinguished phonetically as the <b>space</b> <b>between</b> two inhalations.

3000|$|In general, Fig. 22 {{clearly shows}} a {{correlation}} between the MIMO channel capacity variation and the TX-RX separation distance, i.e., MIMO channel capacity has a larger variation in near-range LOS conditions and a smaller capacity variation in far-range NLOS conditions.

There is greater angular <b>spacing</b> <b>between</b> the MIMO subchannels for LOS links and less angular <b>spacing</b> <b>between</b> the MIMO subchannels for far-range NLOS links, as illustrated in Fig. 2.
