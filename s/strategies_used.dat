Lap45 saw three drivers set consecutive new fastest laps; Kubica's 1:32.366 was beaten by Webber with a 1:32.014s. They were then superseded by Räikkönen, who set a 1:31.691. On lap49 Webber attempted to pass Hamilton at the first chicane, but the two cars touched wheels. Webber was forced down the escape road, and when he emerged in front of Hamilton, he returned the position. Räikkönen continued {{to move through the}} field; he passed Coulthard and Piquet in separate manoeuvres to take ninthposition. Nakajima attempted to pass Coulthard into turnnine, but succeeded only in turning into the Red Bull RB4, sending it into the gravel trap. Coulthard pitted for a new front wing, which dropped him to 17th. Vettel crossed the finish line on lap53 by 12.5seconds over Kovalainen, becoming the youngest driver in Formula One history to win a Grand Prix. The one-stop <b>strategies</b> <b>used</b> by Kubica and Alonso paid off as they finished in third and fourth, respectively. Heidfeld, Massa, Hamilton and Webber rounded out the top eight.

Exercise, orthope-dic outcome, and subjective well-being served as indicators of successful development. Results: There was no evidence for an interaction of age and <b>strategy</b> <b>use.</b> There was also no support for an interaction between resource loss and <b>strategy</b> <b>use</b> but rather for a mediating role of <b>strategy</b> <b>use</b> between resource loss and exercise.

5|$|Strokes {{that occur}} in the {{brainstem}} may cause profound deficits, including locked-in syndrome, in which cognitive, emotional and linguistic abilities remain intact but all or almost all voluntary motor abilities are lost. Most people affected by this type of stroke rely on AAC strategies to communicate, since few recover intelligible speech or functional voice. The AAC <b>strategies</b> <b>used</b> vary with the individual's preferences and motor capabilities which may change over time. As eye movements {{are most likely to be}} preserved, eye blinks are frequently used for communication. Low-tech alphabet boards are often introduced immediately to provide the individual with basic communication. Partner-assisted scanning may be used, in which the AAC user signals when the desired letter is named by a communication partner. When vertical and horizontal eye movements are functional, a transparent alphabet board may be used in which the AAC user looks at the desired letter and this is acknowledged by the communication partner. Individuals with locked-in syndrome have difficulty using high-tech devices due to issues with motor control, vision, memory, alertness and linguistic ability. In particular, a voluntary, reliable and easily controlled muscle movement is necessary to access such a device, such as head, jaw, hand or finger movements. In some individuals, intensive practice, even long after the initial stroke, has been shown to increase the accuracy and consistency of head movements, which can be used to access a communication device.|$|E

30|$|A {{great deal}} of {{attention}} has been drawn toward the facilitative potential of L 2 learning <b>strategy</b> <b>use</b> for L 2 development (Vandergrift 2008). Furthermore, because <b>strategy</b> <b>use</b> encompasses cognitive and behavioral facets of language learning, there is an underlying realization that “strategies are, by definition, examples of motivated learning behavior” (Dörnyei and Ryan 2015, p. 152). In listening as well, <b>strategy</b> <b>use</b> is strongly correlated with L 2 learning motivation. For example, Vandergrift (2005) investigated the relationship between subtypes of self-determined motivation and L 2 listening <b>strategy</b> <b>use</b> in his study of 57 adolescent learners of French, and found that greater use of meta-cognitive L 2 listening strategies is linked to the more self-determined forms of motivation. Pae’s (2009) study of the structural relationships among factors affecting L 2 listening proficiency established that among the self-determined motivation types, only intrinsic motivation had a direct relationship with L 2 listening <b>strategy</b> <b>use</b> and significantly affected L 2 listening proficiency. The results also showed that intrinsic motivation had an indirect influence on L 2 listening proficiency mediated through L 2 listening <b>strategy</b> <b>use.</b> Effectively, L 2 listening strategies are only employed based on the existence of motivation. Among the subtypes of self-determined motivation, more intrinsic forms of motivation are significantly correlated with L 2 <b>strategy</b> <b>use</b> and with L 2 listening proficiency, suggesting that L 2 listening <b>strategy</b> <b>use</b> plays an important mediating role between self-determined motivation and L 2 listening proficiency.|$|R

The <b>strategy</b> <b>use</b> of learners is measured by means of 1) a self-report questionnaire (N= 417) which also elicits relevant biographical information and 2) a verbal report procedure, the yoked subject technique, administered to a subsample of the questionnaire group (N= 37). Canonical variate analysis was applied to the questionnaire data, and instances of <b>strategy</b> <b>use</b> were identified and classified in the verbal protocols using two independent raters. Results indicated that the main influences on <b>strategy</b> <b>use</b> were mode of study and the age of learners; that distance learners were set further apart from classroom learners on metacognitive <b>strategy</b> <b>use</b> measures when the influence of the target language, proficiency, prior target language experience and level of study was considered; that learners who had had prior experience in learning the target language before enrolling in a university language course were maximally distinguished in their cognitive <b>strategy</b> <b>use</b> from learners without such prior experience; that mode of study exerted some influence on cognitive <b>strategy</b> <b>use,</b> but this was less than the influence of prior target language experience; that differences in cognitive <b>strategy</b> <b>use</b> between learners of French and learners of Japanese in the verbal report procedure could not be attributed solely to the influence of the target language; and that distance learners make less <b>use</b> of social <b>strategies</b> and greater <b>use</b> of affective <b>strategies</b> than their classroom counterparts.

40|$|Background/Context: Because metacognitive {{knowledge}} includes {{knowledge about}} adequate learning strategies, and because an effective <b>use</b> of learning <b>strategies</b> {{is associated with}} higher levels of performance, substantial relationships can be assumed between metacognitive knowledge, strategic behavior, and performance.

To test the cross-country generalizability of the relationship between metacognitive knowledge, <b>strategy</b> <b>use,</b> and reading competence, we analyzed data from the PISA 2009 -study, in which similar measures of metacognitive knowledge as well as of students’ <b>strategy</b> <b>use</b> were used. Research Design: The study uses a cross-sectional correlational design. It draws on representative samples of fifteen-year-old students from 34 OECD countries taking part in the PISA 2009 study. The relations between students’ reading competence scores, their metacognitive knowledge as well as their self-reported <b>use</b> of learning <b>strategies</b> were analyzed. We used correlations, mediation, as well as moderator regression analyses to predict students’ reading competence.

40|$|Individuals can employ {{different}} landmark-based wayfinding {{strategies to}} acquire spatial knowledge and support navigation. Allocentric <b>strategy</b> <b>use</b> {{is associated with}} a cognitive representation of a learned environment that allows flexible navigation, while egocentric <b>strategy</b> <b>use</b> is associated with uni-directional knowledge that only supports accurate navigation in tasks that involve reproducing learned behaviours. While many studies have investigated <b>strategy</b> <b>use</b> during navigation, how <b>strategy</b> <b>use</b> develops during spatial learning remains under- researched. Therefore, this thesis primarily investigated the processes underlying strategy selection. Participants’ strategy preference during various navigation tasks, including a novel strategy assessment paradigm developed specifically for this research, revealed that individuals adopt the most accurate strategy available – be it allocentric or egocentric – in accordance with the demands of the concurrent navigation task. Interestingly, when allocentric knowledge was required for accurate navigation, participants initially employed a suboptimal egocentric strategy before switching to an allocentric strategy, suggesting that egocentric knowledge precedes allocentric knowledge. Finally, participants were not subject to performance-related decrements associated with the effort of switching strategies. Interestingly, during spatial learning, participants acquired spatial knowledge related to alternative strategies, and selectively encoded landmarks that were compatible with the <b>use</b> of multiple <b>strategies,</b> which may explain why switching wayfinding strategies is cognitively efficient. This thesis also investigated the effects of aging on strategy selection. Strategy preference changes across the adult lifespan, with decreasing allocentric <b>strategy</b> <b>use</b> primarily attributed to reduced hippocampal function, and impaired egocentric <b>strategy</b> <b>use</b> associated with age-related learning and memory deficits. Analysis revealed that older adults exhibited a task-independent preference for egocentric <b>strategy</b> <b>use,</b> and therefore experienced difficulty with tasks that required allocentric knowledge. However, when egocentric <b>strategy</b> <b>use</b> most efficiently supported accurate navigation, younger and older adults performed similarly, suggesting that egocentric <b>strategy</b> <b>use</b> is largely unaffected by aging. Finally, age differences in strategy preference and spatial learning were observed when the most efficient route learning strategy differed between decision points, supporting findings of increasing susceptibility to switching costs with age. In summary, young adults flexibly employ a variety of strategies to optimise navigational efficacy, while older adults' strategy choices are affected by age-related difficulties with allocentric <b>strategy</b> <b>use</b> and increased vulnerability to strategy switching costs...|$|R
