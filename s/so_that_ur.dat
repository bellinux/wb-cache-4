40|$|Fibronectin-binding {{proteins}} (FnBPs) of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes mediate {{invasion of}} human endothelial and epithelial cells {{in a process}} likely to aid the persistence and/or dissemination of infection. In addition to binding sites for the N-terminal domain (NTD) of fibronectin (Fn), a number of streptococcal FnBPs also contain an upstream region (<b>UR)</b> <b>that</b> is closely associated with an NTD-binding region; UR binds to the adjacent gelatin-binding domain (GBD) of Fn. Previously, UR was shown to be required for efficient streptococcal invasion of epithelial cells. Here we show, using a Streptococcus zooepidemicus FnBP, that the UR-binding site in GBD resides largely in the (8) F 1 (9) F 1 module pair. We also show <b>that</b> <b>UR</b> inhibits binding of a peptide from the α 1 chain of type I collagen to (8) F 1 (9) F 1 and <b>that</b> <b>UR</b> binding to (8) F 1 is likely to occur through anti-parallel β-zipper formation. Thus, we propose that streptococcal proteins that contain adjacent NTD- and GBD-binding sites form a highly unusual extended tandem β-zipper that spans the two domains and mediates high affinity binding to Fn through a large intermolecular interface. The proximity of the UR- and NTD-binding sequences in streptococcal FnBPs {{is consistent with a}} non-linear arrangement of modules in the tertiary structure of the GBD of Fn...|$|R
40|$|Unexplained residuals’ (UR) {{models have}} been used within lifecourse {{epidemiology}} to model an exposure measured longitudinally at several time points {{in relation to a}} distal outcome. It has been claimed that these models have several advantages, including: the ability to estimate multiple total causal effects in a single model, and additional insight into the effect on the outcome of greater-than-expected increases in the exposure compared to traditional regression methods. We evaluate these properties, and prove mathematically how adjustment for confounding variables must be made within this modelling framework. Importantly, we explicitly place UR models in a causal framework using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). This allows for theoretical justification of appropriate confounder adjustment, and provides a framework for extending our results to more complex scenarios than those examined in this paper. We also discuss several interpretational issues relating to UR models within a causal framework. We argue <b>that</b> <b>UR</b> models offer no additional insights compared to traditional regression methods, and, in fact, are more challenging to implement; moreover, they artificially reduce estimated standard errors. Consequently, we conclude <b>that</b> <b>UR</b> models, if used, must be implemented with great care...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability of}} the leishmanial {{parasite}} UR 6 {{to act as an}} immunoprophylactic and immunotherapeutic agent against Leishmania donovani infection in BALB/c mice was investigated. Unlike the virulent L. donovani AG 83 (MOHOM/IN/ 1983 /AG 83), UR 6 given through intracardiac route failed to induce visceral infection, but when it was injected subcutaneously, UR 6 induced a short-lived and localized self-healing skin lesion. Priming of peritoneal macrophages with UR 6 in vitro induced superoxide (O 2 −) generation, whereas similar experiments with virulent AG 83 inhibited O 2 − generation. It was observed that priming of mice with either live or sonicated UR 6 {{in the absence of any}} adjuvant provided strong protection against subsequent virulent challenge. Further, UR 6 -primed infected mice not only displayed a strong antileishmanial delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response but also showed an elevated level of the serum antileishmanial immunoglobulin G 2 a (IgG 2 a) isotype, whereas infected mice failed to mount any antileishmanial DTH response and showed an elevated level of IgG 1. This indicates <b>that</b> <b>UR</b> 6 priming and subsequent L. donovani infection allowed the expansion of Th 1 cells. Our studies indicate <b>that</b> <b>UR</b> 6 has potential to be used as an immunoprophylactic and immunotherapeutic agent against experimental visceral leishmaniasis...|$|R

40|$|Epstein-Barr Nuclear Antigen 1 (EBNA 1) is {{essential}} for Epstein-Barr virus to immortalize naïve B-cells. Upon binding a cluster of 20 cognate binding-sites termed the family of repeats, EBNA 1 transactivates promoters for EBV genes that are required for immortalization. A small domain, termed <b>UR</b> 1, <b>that</b> is 25 amino-acids in length, has been identified previously as essential for EBNA 1 to activate transcription. In this study, we have elucidated how UR 1 contributes to EBNA 1 ’s ability to transactivate. We show that zinc is necessary for EBNA 1 to activate transcription, and <b>that</b> <b>UR</b> 1 coordinates zinc through a pair of essential cysteines contained within it. UR 1 dimerizes upon coordinating zinc, indicating that EBNA 1 contains a second dimerization interface in its amino-terminus. There is {{a strong correlation between}} UR 1 -mediated dimerization and EBNA 1 ’s ability to transactivate cooperatively. Point mutants of EBNA 1 that disrupt zinc coordination also prevent self-association, and do not activate transcription cooperatively. Further, we demonstrate <b>that</b> <b>UR</b> 1 acts as a molecular sensor that regulates the ability of EBNA 1 to activate transcription in response to changes in redox and oxygen partial pressure (pO 2). Mild oxidative stress mimicking such environmental changes decreases EBNA 1 -dependent transcription in a lymphoblastoid cell-line. Coincident with a reduction in EBNA 1 -dependent transcription, reductions are observed in EBNA 2 and LMP 1 protein levels. Although these changes do not affect LCL survival, treated cells accumulate in G 0 /G 1. These findings are discussed in the context of EB...|$|R
