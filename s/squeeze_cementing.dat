50|$|Fracturing as {{a method}} to stimulate shallow, hard rock oil wells {{dates back to the}} 1860s. Oil {{producers}} in Pennsylvania, New York, Kentucky, and West Virginia used nitroglycerin (liquid at first, and later solid) to break up the oil-bearing formation. The method was later applied to water and natural gas wells. The idea of using acid as a nonexplosive fluid for well stimulation was introduced in the 1930s. Acid etching kept fractures open and enhanced productivity. Water injection and <b>squeeze</b> <b>cementing</b> (injection of cement slurry) had a similar effect.|$|E

To solve this problem, <b>squeezing</b> <b>cement</b> to plug channeling is one conventional way. This way has advantages of lower construction cost and short construction time.

(2009); Van Eijden et al. 2004; Lane and Sanders 1995; Van Eijden et al. 2005). To make the damage reduced to an absolute minimum, new treatment fluid must be developed. After a large amount of testing work, new fuzzy-ball micro bubble treatment fluid is developed.|$|R

40|$|Production {{of excess}} water with oil {{represents}} a re al challenge to most oil producers especially in high environmental sensitive regions. Chemical shutoff (<b>squeeze</b> <b>cement,</b> polymer gels and foams) and/or mechanical i solators (packers) represent efficient methods {{to reduce or}} stop oil-associated water and may consequently increase oil production. The required placement pr ocess of chemical differs by the difference of required mechanism whether to increas e oil production or to shutoff water. In water shutoff treatments, the chemical i s required to penetrate mostly in watered-out fractures and/or high permeability stre aks to plug water production whereas in mobility control mechanism, the chemical is required to act differently by penetrating deeply in the low permeability oil-bear ing zones to displace the oil.

The objective of this work was to test the sealing ability of a commercially available temperature-activated polymer resin in a laboratory-scale <b>squeeze</b> <b>cementing</b> operation. Two well leakage scenarios were selected: micro-annuli or cracks in cement and debonding at cement-casing interface.

Then the samples were disassembled and studied by optical microscopy. The squeeze procedure proved to be successful for plugging the designed leak paths...|$|E
40|$|This thesis mainly discuss about {{workover}} (<b>Squeeze</b> <b>Cementing)</b> evaluation Activity in OKTA- 36 well of OKTA field, East Java. The {{choice to}} did a workover activity in this well {{was because the}} oil and gas production for this particular carbonate well has been depleted. The cause of this problem was the watering problem near wellbore as the problem was found by using the Chan 2 ̆ 7 s Diagnostics. Chan 2 ̆ 7 s diagnostics is one of a method to determine the watering problem by comparing days to the existing production data. To increase {{the oil and gas}} productivity of this well, the justification was to close the old perforation interval of 6300 ft – 6330 ft MD by squeezing cement activity and then move the perforation interval to 6195 ft – 6205 ft MD and 6220 ft – 6230 ft MD. To fix the wellbore problem caused by water, the interval of 6260 ft – 6262 ft MD was also squeezed. The choice of 6260 ft - 6262 ft MD was based on the tightness of the formation because of the total loss characteristics of the well. The result shows that the workover activity was a success because of the massive increase in oil and gas productivity. The numbers for the production performance analysis after workover activities are the WHP of 925 psi, WHT of 122 o F, FLP 280 psi, Choke 30 / 64 ”, oil production 1242 BOPD, Water Cut 0...|$|E
40|$|In the {{construction}} {{of oil and gas}} well, improper displacement work (primary cementing job) may cause poor zonal isolation, cement channeling, remedial <b>squeeze</b> <b>cementing,</b> and thus lead to a severe problem. The leakage of the wellbore fluids and contamination of sensitive zones resulting from poor primary cementing job such as the Gulf of Mexico's oil spill in April 2010 has been the biggest disaster accidents for mankind history since then. The experimental flow system was developed for systematic study of both single-fluid flow and two-fluid displacement in eccentric annuli. This flow is relevant to the drilling operation and cementing operation in oil well completions, where drilling fluids are displaced from the annulus between the casing and the well bore by a series of spacer/wash fluids and cement slurries. The design of the system is based on the helical flow geometry, which is a combination of annular axial flow and tangential rotating flow in an annulus. The annular flow apparatus can be operated at various degrees of eccentricity and different angles of inclination to simulate the type of flows in oilfield drilling and cementing operations. A special feature of the flow system is that the inner pipe can be rotated during displacement, allowing the effect of casing rotation on the performance of the annular displacement process to be studied. Single fluid flow with various models of rheological fluids and displacement tests with various models of rheological fluids, especially viscoplastic fluids representing drilling and cementing fluids was conducted at different eccentricities, pipe inclinations, and over a range of flow rates and cylinder rotational speeds. Regarding the entire results of the displacement experiments, to our knowledge, the images of the moving fluid-fluid interface in annular displacement flow, especially with a rotating cylinder, generated in this work may be considered to be the world leading, since such visual information is not available in the open literature. In addition to flow visualization, the velocity of moving fluidvi-fluid interface in annular displacement flow was studied by measuring the conductivity of tested fluids. The result reveals the dynamics of displacement flow in annuli. A method was developed for simultaneously determining the displacement efficiency by measuring the conductivity of the mixed fluid phase exiting the annulus. The results obtained are of sufficient accuracy to be useful for assessing the effects of key variables such as pipe standoff, pump rate, pipe rotation and fluid rheology, on the effectiveness of annular displacement process. The relationship between the pressure gradient and the displacement efficiency has been established for the displacement process. The basic general mixing rule of a binary system occupied in term of pressure gradient may be illustrated. The pressure gradient of the mixture at any specific time of the displacement process may be illustrated by the equation comprising of the pressure gradient of each pure component in the mixture (in mass, mole, or volume fraction) derived from the results of the single-fluid flow experiments. Finally, the graph plots of the model prediction for the friction pressure gradient of the displacement process were shown, illustrating that the results from model equation collapses properly on the experimental result. To summarize, the results obtained in this work is useful for assessing the effects of fundamental variables such as eccentricity, pipe inclination, flow rate, pipe rotation and fluid rheology, that impact on the effectiveness of the annular displacement process. In particular, the flow visualization data, the velocity of moving fluid-fluid interface, the displacement efficiency, and friction pressure modelling results obtained from this project can be used to compare with, and validate, Halliburton’s 3 -D simulation CFD, implemented.

40|$|Tubing and rods of the S. P. Pedro-Nepple No. 1 well {{were pulled}} and the well was {{prepared}} for running of Schlumberger's Cased Hole Formation Resistivity Tool (CHFR) in selected intervals. The CHFR tool was successfully run and data was captured. The CHFR formation resistivity readings were compared to original open hole resistivity measurements. Separation between the original and CHFR resistivity curves indicate both swept and un-swept sand intervals. Both watered out sand intervals and those with higher remaining oil saturation have been identified. Due {{to the nature of}} these turbidite sands being stratigraphically continuous, both the swept and unswept layers have been correlated across to one of the four nearby offset shallow wells. As a result of the cased hole logging, one well was selected for a workover to recomplete and test suspected oil saturated shallow sand intervals. Well S. P. Pedro-Nepple No. 2 was plugged back with cement excluding the previously existing production interval, <b>squeeze</b> <b>cemented</b> behind casing, selectively perforated in the shallower ''Bell'' zone and placed on production to develop potential new oil reserves and increase overall well productivity. Prior workover production averaged 3. 0 BOPD for the previous six-months from the original ''Meyer'' completion interval. Post workover well production was increased to 5. 3 BOPD on average for the following fifteen months. In December 2005, a bridge plug was installed above the ''Bell'' zone to test the ''Foix'' zone.

40|$|Production of {{oil on the}} Norwegian {{continental}} shelf started in the early 70 ’s. Many of these fields are now reaching {{the end of their}} production time. The industry is now awaiting a “plug wave” in the not too distant future. Decommission is a time-consuming procedure, and the cost of P&A can end up being 25 % of the total cost of the well. The task given from Wintershall was to plan P&A operation by setting a dual barrier plug against the creeping clay in the Hordaland formation. The Hordaland green clay will creep in and seal around the casing and create a bonding with the casing. This method has saved operators on the Norwegian {{continental shelf}} for millions of NOK, by avoiding milling or <b>squeeze</b> <b>cement</b> job. All the wells at Brage require permanent P&A in order to control subsurface pressure and prevent the free flow of pore fluids to the seabed. The wells at Brage was categorized depending on the different casing design. The objective was to determine the time for P&A for every category. There were three different casing designs that stood out: pre-drilled wells, production liner with tie-back casing and simplified casing design. The most likely time for plugging the 40 wells at Brage is estimated to be around 3 years. The time estimate is done with the technology available today. In the future there might be new technology that will enable the operator to P&A the field in a more cost-effective way. Many service companies are working on developing tomorrows P&A solution. Some of the new technologies will be presented and discussed in this thesis, together with the use of formation as a barrier...|$|R
40|$|When {{oil and gas}} wells {{reach the}} end of their {{production}} life, they need to be permanently plugged and abandoned. The requirements for a permanent barrier state that it must cover the entire cross-section of the wellbore, including all annuli. This thesis evaluates a new method of establishing a cross-sectional barrier in areas with poor, non-sealing annular cement. The traditional method is to mill away the section with poor cement and set an open hole cement plug, but due to the ECD effect of milling fluids, this is not always desirable. In some formations on the Gullfaks field, the operational pressure window is too small for section milling. An alternative solution was therefore tried out on a well that needed plugging. This method, referred to as punch and squeeze, consisted of perforating the section of poorly <b>cemented</b> casing and <b>squeezing</b> <b>cement</b> into the annulus. In this thesis, the equipment and techniques used are presented and evaluated, along with general theory relevant to plugging and abandonment. On Gullfaks, two punch and squeeze techniques were used. In the first, cement was pumped through a packer plug and squeezed into the perforations. The second technique involved setting a balanced cement plug over the perforations, and squeezing this plug into the perforations. The main conclusions are that the technique using a packer plug is safer with regards to well control, involves less waiting on cement and gives a better annular seal than the balanced plug alternative. Also, a cement evaluation log should be run before the squeeze jobs are performed, and the log results should be used when determining where to perforate. All things considered, {{it was found that the}} punch and squeeze method can succeed in creating a length of cross-sectional cement, but still involves some uncertainty and the technique can be further optimized...|$|R
40|$|A {{borehole}} drilled at Fiumicino (Rome) down to only 27 m {{depth in}} a zone where no gas emission {{at the surface}} was known, caused a gas blowout from a pressurized gas pocket confined beneath a clay cover. Gas slowly diffused from the borehole within superficial permeable sand. Seven persons living in three ground floor flats of a near building had to be hospitalized due to CO 2 exposure. All the houses in the proximity were evacuated. At {{the request of the}} Fire Brigade two additional boreholes were drilled nearby, hoping that this could rapidly exhaust the gas stored underground. To the contrary the soil gas flux near houses increased and indoor CO 2 air concentration rapidly rose to lethal values (15 to 30 vol. %). As a remediation we suggested to restore the continuity of the impervious gas cover by <b>squeezing</b> quick-setting <b>cement</b> into the formation through new boreholes to be drilled near the existing ones. Although the first <b>cement</b> <b>squeeze</b> reduced drastically the CO 2 soil flux and indoor concentration, six additional squeezes had to be carried out in order to lower the gas emission below the gas hazard threshold. The gas was mostly made of CO 2 (98 vol. %) with minor N 2 and CH 4. Its chemical and isotopic composition (δ 13 CCO 2 = − 1. 55; 3 He/ 4 He = 0. 314 Ra) {{is similar to that of}} the gas manifestations of Mts. Sabatini and Alban Hills volcanic areas. Though being somewhat contaminated by crustal and shallow organic volatiles, these gases likely have a component originated in the mantle, that beneath the volcanic Roman Comagmatic Province is probably deeply contaminated with crustal material.

40|$|The present work shows, that {{squeezing}} {{pore water}} out of hardened cement pastes with different w/c-ratios allows to determine the quantity of pore solution. Balancing total water in hardened cement pastes with a w/c-ratio of 0, 50 (Σ water of crystallisation (hydration water) + squeezed interstitial water in g/kg cement paste) leads to uncertainties less than 5 %. The ion balance of squeezed interstitial water proves that with high probability the squeezed water reflects {{the status of the}} interstitial water in hardened cement paste. With the complete squeezing of interstitial or pore solution with high pressure at room temperature it is possible to extract all soluble salts including Ca(OH) 2 solved in interstitial water with out disturbing the establishment of equilibrium (equilibrium concentration) of the salts in pore solution. The combination of squeezing and DTA allows the determination of Portlandite in hardened cement paste with a w/c-ratio of 0, 50.

40|$|The Valhall {{field is}} the largest field that BP {{operates}} on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, {{and is one of}} the most well known high porosity chalk fields in the Southern part of the North Sea. During many years of oil production, there has been compaction of the reservoir. The current casing design at Valhall has developed with time as the field has matured, and is affected by several considerations like casing shear in the overburden due to subsidence, non-uniform loading in the reservoir due to chalk production and compaction. The main objective of this thesis was to develop options that could be included in the current casing design, to guarantee a higher injection pressure than is available today at the Valhall field. The current design is limiting the maximum injection pressure in the water injectors, and the main factor is the use of 95 / 8 ” drilling liner combined with a <b>cement</b> <b>squeeze</b> job through a C-Flex port collar. This cement job is not approved as a barrier element as required by NORSOK. The injection pressure is today limited by the strength of the 133 / 8 ” casing shoe, which is lower than desired. The study involves reviewing BP’s casing design manual, the current casing design on Valhall, the special requirements for Valhall, and investigating several technologies that could provide potential solutions to the barrier challenges on Valhall. The recommended option is to include the External Sleeve Inflatable Packer Collar (ESIPC), Cement Assurance Tool and the C-Flex in the 95 / 8 ” drilling liner. The ESIPC would provide a good cement job in the liner annulus, as it would enable returns to be observed during the cement job, providing evidence that there is a cement column behind the drilling liner by a cement bond log. The C-Flex is included to make it possible to perform a <b>cement</b> <b>squeeze</b> job through the C-Flex additionally to the ESIPC or in worst case alone if the ESIPC fails. The Cement Assurance Tool is just an extra safety in case the cement around the liner would contract and make a micro-annulus, which could create a possible leak. This option would most likely provide a barrier element according to NORSOK. This barrier element is very important to be able to increase the injection pressure at a wanted level, which is approximately 6, 300 psi. At present time, the ESIPC is not strong enough to be included in a drilling liner. It has to be reinforced and tested before it could be included in the drilling liner to be able to withstand the large forces acting on the tool. The corresponding dual bottom-top wiper plug set has to be reinforced as well, because the plug set would be exposed to large forces during the losses, and when it is set inside the ESIPC...|$|R
40|$|As {{domestic}} {{oil and gas}} fields approach maturity or even abandonment, new methods are being tested to add life to the fields. One area being addressed is the reduction of water production to extend the economic life of a field. In many fields a very common problem is permeability heterogeneity from matrix variations, fractures, or both. Conventional procedures to remediate high water rates in fractured networks, including <b>cement</b> <b>squeezing,</b> openhole packers, and liners are generally unsuccessful. The objective of this project was to test the viability of using sequential treatment of a production well with a cross-linked polymer to restrict water production from highly permeable and fractured zones. The field used for testing was the Ashley Valley field in northeastern Utah. The process proposed for testing in this field was the sequential application of small batches of a cross-linked polymer, chromium (III) polyacrylamide polymer (Marcit{trademark}). First, the highest permeability fractures were to be blocked, followed progressively by smaller fractures, and finally the higher permeability matrix channels. The initial application of this polymer in September 1997 in the Ashley Valley (AV) well No. 2 did increase oil production while decreasing both water production and the relative permeability to water. The successive application of the polymer was considered as a method to increase both daily and ultimate oil production and reduce produced water. The second polymer treatment was conducted in October 1999 in AV No. 2. The treatment consisted of 4, 994 barrels of 1, 500 -mg/l to 9, 000 -mg/l polymer at surface injection pressures no higher than 380 psig. During injection, four offset wells showed polymer breakthrough and were shut in during the remaining treatment. Present oil and water production rates for AV No. 2 are 14 BOPD and 2, 700 BWPD, which is a 44 % decrease in the oil rate and a 40 % reduction in water from the rates after the first treatment. The decrease in water production did result in a minimal savings on both utilities and water-treatment chemicals. However, the savings did not offset the decrease in oil production. The second treatment appears to have targeted a different, high-permeability network than the first treatment, indicating that the first treatment was still effective after two years. Because of the negative results from the second treatment, the conduct of a third treatment has been shelved. The possibility of a larger treatment in another well with the shut in of adjacent wells as the polymer is detected is being considered if further treatment is conducted...|$|R
