During the first <b>session</b> {{on the morning}} of January 20, 2011, thirty-three drivers participated, and Clint Bowyer was quickest with a speed of 184.216mph while David Reutimann had the highest speed of 195.780mph during the second <b>session</b> in the afternoon. The third test <b>session,</b> scheduled for the morning of January 21, was canceled because of wet weather. During the fourth <b>session,</b> held during the afternoon, 34 drivers participated with Denny Hamlin being quickest with a speed of 196.868mph.

5|$|The {{qualifying}} <b>session</b> on Saturday {{afternoon was}} split into threeparts. The first part ran for 20minutes, and cars that finished the <b>session</b> 17th position or lower were eliminated from qualifying. The {{second part of}} the qualifying <b>session</b> lasted 15minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions11 to 16. The final part of the qualifying <b>session</b> determined the positions from first to tenth, and decided pole position. Cars which failed to make the final <b>session</b> could refuel before the race, so ran lighter in those sessions. Cars which competed in the final <b>session</b> of qualifying were not allowed to refuel before the race, and as such carried more fuel than in the previous sessions.|$|E
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions {{were before the}} Sunday race — one on Friday, and two on Saturday. The first <b>session</b> lasted 90 minutes, while the second <b>session</b> lasted 45 minutes.

5|$|A major {{accomplishment}} of the Johnson administration was {{the passage of}} a legislative redistricting bill. Despite the fact that the U.S. Constitution requires redistricting after every decennial census, Kentucky's legislative districts had remained virtually unchanged between 1893 and 1941. He asked the 1942 legislative <b>session</b> to adjourn early so he could call a special <b>session</b> {{for the sole purpose of}} considering a redistricting bill. The legislators obliged, and passed a bill by the end of the special <b>session.</b>|$|E
5|$|Also in the 1878 <b>session,</b> tax {{assessments}} for railroad property {{were raised}} to match {{those of other}} property. Agrarian interests were pleased that the legal interest rate was again lowered, now reaching the six percent they had proposed in the previous <b>session.</b> Non-economic reforms included the separation of Kentucky Agricultural and Mechanical College (later the University of Kentucky) from Kentucky University (later Transylvania University) {{and the establishment of}} a state board of health. Bills of local import again dominated the <b>session,</b> representing 90 percent of the acts and resolutions passed by the Assembly.|$|E
5|$|Although {{calls for}} a special <b>session</b> of the {{legislature}} {{had been made in}} February and March, Governor Stanley was not initially receptive to the idea at the beginning of April. In mid-April, Virginia Lieutenant Governor Gi Stevens urged Stanley to call a special <b>session</b> of the General Assembly to reconsider the Gray Commission proposals. In May, at least one state delegate urged the General Assembly to call itself into special <b>session.</b>|$|E
50|$|Additionally National Committees of EYP organise several {{national}} and regional <b>sessions</b> every year.

5|$|Although the Texas Legislature {{typically}} meets {{once every}} two years, a fire destroyed the state capitol building in November 1881, and Ross was called to serve in a special <b>session</b> in April 1882.

Near the end of the special <b>session,</b> the Senate passed a reapportionment bill, which reduced Ross's four-year term to only two years. He declined to run again.|$|E
5|$|As {{temperatures}} cooled in {{the final}} qualifying <b>session,</b> {{over a third of}} the field improved their fastest laps, but Jani's pole position time was unchallenged. Audi No. 7 led the <b>session</b> with a three minutes and 20.967 seconds lap time, still over four seconds shy of pole position. Nissan improved all three of their cars during the <b>session,</b> closing to within a second of the closest LMP1 competitor. The No. 26 G-Drive Ligier-Nissan closed to within a second of KCMG to take the second grid position in LMP2, while Greaves remained in third. In LMGTE Pro the No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari rebounded from the loss of their qualifying times in the first <b>session</b> to lead the final <b>session</b> and come within a tenth of a second of Aston Martin. The sister AF Corse Ferrari also improved to fourth in the category to split the top of the grid in the class amongst the two manufacturers. The lead in LMGTE Am remained with the No. 98 Aston Martin, a second and a half ahead of the No. 83 AF Corse Ferrari. SMP Racing improved their time by leading both of the day's qualifying sessions to take second place on the grid, splitting the Aston Martin cars. The No. 67 AAI Porsche suffered a fire during the <b>session</b> which halted qualifying for nearly half an hour.|$|E

5|$|During the 1988 {{legislative}} <b>session,</b> Governor Wilkinson {{proposed an}} amendment to the Kentucky Constitution that would allow state officials, including the sitting incumbents, to succeed themselves in office once. As presiding officer in the Senate, Jones insisted that any such measure also include a runoff provision if a candidate did not receive a majority of votes in the party primary. Wilkinson opposed this provision, and the measure died in the state senate. Wilkinson's proposed education program also failed in the <b>session,</b> and Jones suggested that the governor should build a consensus among legislators before including the program on the agenda of a special legislative <b>session,</b> which Wilkinson had proposed for January 1989. After the 1988 <b>session,</b> Wilkinson called Jones a backstabber and accused him of sabotaging the succession amendment. The two did not meet for six months following the <b>session.</b>|$|E
5|$|During {{the spring}} and into the summer, Stanley began meeting with Senator Byrd, State Senator Gray, and others to strategize about a course of action. Byrd was {{concerned}} that one or more local school districts might integrate, creating a domino effect {{that would lead to}} integration across the entire South. Preventing this from happening became the preeminent concern of Stanley, Byrd, and the others. Stanley called the Gray Commission back into <b>session</b> in late May 1956, but the group was unable to immediately come up with any new recommendations. Attorney General Almond publicly urged Stanley to call a special <b>session</b> of the legislature on May 31, but House Speaker Moore demanded to know what proposals Almond felt the legislature should pass before any special <b>session</b> was called. On June 4, the Gray Commission again reported to the governor that it {{had not been able to}} improve on its November proposals, but it, too, advised the governor to call a special <b>session</b> of the legislature. The following day, Governor Stanley announced he would call the legislature into special <b>session</b> in late August.|$|E

50|$|The current District Court was {{established}} in 1961.

From 1836, the justices acted {{under the supervision of}} resident magistrates. The Petty <b>Sessions</b> (Ireland) Act 1851 regulated petty <b>sessions,</b> organising the country into petty <b>sessions</b> districts and providing for the appointment of clerks of petty <b>sessions.</b> A series of Summary Jurisdiction (Ireland) Acts, beginning in 1851, vested petty <b>sessions</b> with summary jurisdiction in minor criminal matters. Both these Acts are still on the statute book, though heavily amended. In Dublin, the divisional magistrates exercised similar power to petty <b>sessions</b> under the Dublin Police Acts.|$|R
40|$|Hemodialysis (HD) {{is one of}} the {{important}} modalities of renal replacement therapy in acute renal failure (ARF) as well as chronic renal failure (CRF). This study was performed to evaluate the various intradialytic complications that occur during HD and their management. This is a retrospective study performed in patients who underwent conventional HD during the period of 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2011 at our center. Clinical details, various complications faced and their management were retrieved from dialysis case sheets. A total of 2325 patients of renal failure (790 ARF and 1535 CRF patients) were assessed for the intradialytic complications of HD. During the study period, there were 12, 785 bicarbonate dialyses performed on these patients. In the ARF patients, the common intradialytic complications were: Hypotension, seen in 1296 <b>sessions</b> (30. 4 %), nausea and vomiting seen in 1125 <b>sessions</b> (26. 4 %), fever and chills seen in 818 <b>sessions</b> (19. 2 %), headache seen in 665 <b>sessions</b> (15. 6 %), cramps seen in 85 <b>sessions</b> (2. 0 %), chest pain and back pain seen in 82 <b>sessions</b> (1. 92 %), hypoglycemia seen in 77 <b>sessions</b> (1. 8 %), first-use syndrome seen in 72 <b>sessions</b> (1. 7 %) and femoral hematoma seen in 31 <b>sessions</b> (0. 73 %). In the CRF group, common complications were hypotension in 2230 <b>sessions</b> (26. 1 %), nausea and vomiting in 1211 <b>sessions</b> (14. 2 %), fever and chills in 1228 <b>sessions</b> (14. 4 %), chest pain and back pain in 1108 cases (13. 0 %), hypertension in 886 <b>sessions</b> (10. 4 %), headache in 886 <b>sessions</b> (10. 4 %), cramps in 256 <b>sessions</b> (3. 0 %), hematoma in 55 <b>sessions</b> (0. 64 %), intracerebral hemorrhage in three <b>sessions</b> (0. 03 %) and catheter tip migration in three <b>sessions</b> (0. 03 %).
