Rear Admiral Yin Zhuo stated that the aircraft's air combat capabilities were better than that of the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. However, he also stated that its ability to attack land and sea targets was slightly inferior to the F/A-18E/F; it is also stated that its electronic equipment meets the standards of those on a fifth generation fighter.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the vast}} number of Washington-Franklin stamps released—as <b>said,</b> <b>more</b> than 250 in seven {{different}} series—only five basic designs were employed during their printing and production. Two separate engravings—one of Washington, the other of Franklin—are used in the five basic design types. The engraving of George Washington was modeled after a bust (sculpture) by the celebrated sculptor Jean Antoine Houdon. The image of Franklin in this issue was engraved by Marcus Baldwin who modeled his engraving after {{a photograph of a}} plaster bust of Franklin created by Jean Jacques Caffieri in 1777. As the issue evolved through its seven series, Washington and Franklin replaced each other on some values—marking the first time in United States postal history that two men had appeared on the same denomination in one issue. Indeed, both Washington and Franklin ultimately appeared on the 1-cent, 8-cent, 10-cent, 13-cent, 15-cent, 50-cent and 1-dollar values.|$|E
25|$|From the 1970s to {{the early}} 1990s, {{a third of those}} who lived in the city worked in the shoe industry. According to the shoe factory owner Tareq Abu Felat, the number reached least 35,000 people and there were more than 1,000 {{workshops}} around the city. Statistics from the Chamber of Commerce in Hebron put the figure at 40,000 people employed in 1,200 shoe businesses. However, the 1993 Oslo Accords and 1994 Protocol on Economic Relations between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) made it possible to mass import Chinese goods as the Palestinian National Authority, which was created after the Oslo Accords, did not regulate it. They later put import taxes but the Abu Felat, who also is the Palestinian Federation of Leather Industries's chairman, <b>said</b> <b>more</b> is still needed. The Palestinian government decided to impose an additional tax of 35% on products from China from April 2013.|$|E

25|$|Sales were {{encouraging}} {{throughout the}} holiday season, though sources vary {{on how many}} consoles were sold then. In 1986, Nintendo said it sold nearly 90,000 units in nine weeks during its 1985 New York City test run. Nintendo added Los Angeles as a test market in February 1986, followed by Chicago and San Francisco, then other top 12 US markets, and nationwide sales in September.

Nintendo obtained a distribution deal with toy company Worlds of Wonder, which leveraged its popular Teddy Ruxpin and Lazer Tag products to solicit more stores to carry the console. The largest retailer Sears sold it through its Christmas catalog and the second largest retailer Kmart sold it in 700 stores. Nintendo sold 1.1 million consoles in 1986, estimating that it could have sold 1.4 million if inventory had held out. Nintendo earned $310 million in sales, out of total 1986 video game industry sales of $430 million, compared to total 1985 industry sales of $100 million.|$|E
25|$|Even though Trami didn't made {{landfall}} {{over the}} Philippines, the storm did enhanced the southwest monsoon which brought extreme flooding {{throughout most of}} the country on August 18. Due to this, the government declares suspension of classes in some areas and PAGASA subsequently issued several rainfall advisories. Major areas in Metro Manila and nearby provinces reported severe flooding. The Marikina River as high as 19 meters, forcing authorities evacuate nearby residents. 8 people in the Philippines have been killed due to flooding. Monsoon rains are seen in Metro Manila, Regions I, IV-A, IV-B and V which may trigger flashfloods and landslides. Western Visayas, Zamboanga Peninsula and the rest of Luzon will have cloudy skies with light to moderate rainshowers and thunderstorms, Pagasa added. The rest of the country will be partly cloudy to cloudy with isolated rainshowers or thunderstorms, it also <b>said.</b> <b>More</b> than half of Manila was flooded on the morning of August 20, although waters in some areas subsided by about 20 percent in the evening, authorities said. For two days, classes and work in government offices were suspended in Metro Manila and surrounding provinces of Laguna and Cavite, which bore the brunt of the heavy downpour. Laguna and Cavite, south of Manila, are where several foreign-funded industrial plants are located. According to an assessment by the Department of Science and Technology, rainfall reached 600mm (23.62 inches) in and around Manila Bay on August 18. Cebu is now the site of search operations for victims of a collision between the passenger ship MV Saint Thomas Aquinas 1 and the cargo vessel MV Sulpicio Express 7. At least 37 have been confirmed dead {{in the wake of the}} accident on the afternoon of August 18, which some 82 are still missing. The NDRRMC quickly mobilized units from the military and its reserves in response to critical areas being hit by rising floodwaters. Units from both MMDA and PNRC also responded to the call and pre-positioned its personnel along critical areas of Metro Manila. According to NDRRMC's last report on August 30, in total, Trami has caused P690 million ($15.4 million USD) of damage and killed a total of 27 people, in which 30 injured and 4 missing.|$|E
