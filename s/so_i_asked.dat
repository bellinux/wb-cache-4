500|$|The {{circumstances}} of Arjen and Bernadien's first meeting {{have been reported}} by his former youth coach, Barend Beltman: [...] "Arjen was driven and determined at a young age. He was always on time, never late. But one Friday afternoon he showed up 15 minutes past the start of practice. I asked him what was going on. 'We were at the market square, having fun,' he said. There were some girls {{with him and his}} friends, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked,</b> 'Was she worth it?' 'Yes, trainer, she was,' he told me. I told him to get his gear and join the training session. At his wedding, I heard the woman he met that day was now his wife and mother of his children. Bernadien is her name." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2008, it was {{reported}} that Wellard was to be killed off. A show insider explained: [...] "Wellard has been a much-loved character and everyone will be sad to see him go. But if you think about it, Wellard was not a puppy when he arrived on Albert Square, so he would be over 100 in dog years by now. It makes sense for him to bow out of the show gracefully." [...] Raddings commented: [...] "I used to take Kyte on set everyday but I found the scenes when Wellard was put down too hard to watch <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> someone else to take her to filming." [...] The scene in which Wellard was euthanised had to be re-edited, as Kyte could be seen breathing when supposedly dead. At the time of his death, Wellard had been in EastEnders for 14 years, making him one of the show's longest-running characters, and its longest-serving pet.|$|E
500|$|Padukone has {{admitted}} to being socially awkward {{as a child}} and did not have many friends. The focus of her life was badminton, which she played competitively from a young age. Describing her daily routine in a 2012 interview, Padukone said, [...] "I would wake up at five in the morning, go for physical training, go to school, again go for playing badminton, finish my homework, and go to sleep." [...] Padukone continued to pursue a career in badminton throughout her school years and played the sport in national level championships. She also played baseball in a few state level tournaments. While concentrating on her education and sporting career, Padukone also worked as a child model, first appearing in a couple of advertising campaigns at the age of eight. In the tenth grade, she changed focus and decided to become a fashion model. She later explained, [...] "I realised that I was playing the game only because it ran in the family. <b>So,</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> my father if I could give up the game and he wasn't upset at all." [...] In 2004, she began a full-time career as a model under the tutelage of Prasad Bidapa.|$|E
5000|$|Tabi Bonney {{refers to}} the song on the Curren$y {{collaboration}} [...] "Radio" [...] when he says [...] "I got plenty girls but it ain't enough, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> Q-Tip, 'what's up with Bonita.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What do I {{care who}} hears me now? You have made caution unnecessary," [...] she responded, sharply. [...] "All {{the world knows}} us now! and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you again, {{what are you doing}} here?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Did your majesty appoint me only {{to pretend}} to take advice? Personally, I feel ashamed if I receive wages but do not perform my duties. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> your majesty to relieve me of my post." ...|$|R
500|$|Nino, a key villain, {{is portrayed}} by Ron Perlman, {{one of the}} last actors to join the cast. Regarding the casting of Perlman, Refn said, [...] "The {{character}} of Nino was originally not particularly interesting, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> Ron why he wanted to be in my movie when he's done so many great films. When Perlman said, 'I always wanted to play a Jewish man who wants to be an Italian gangster', and I asked why, and he said, 'because that's what I am – a Jewish boy from New York', well, that automatically cemented it for me." [...] Oscar Isaac portrays a Latino convict named Standard, who is married to Irene and is just released from prison a week after Irene meets The Driver. He found the role to be a bit unappealing and chose to turn the archetypal character into something more. He said of the role: As soon as I sat down with Nicolas, he explained this universe and world of the story, so we made the character into someone interested in owning a restaurant, someone who made some wrong decisions in his life, ending up in a bad place. By making 'Standard' more specific and more interesting, we found that it made the story that more compelling.|$|E
500|$|... "I {{wanted to}} know how to dive into the base because I was getting {{strawberries}} on my knees and strawberries on my ass... I was thinking about head-first versus feet-first, and wondering which would save my body. With head-first I worried about pounding my shoulders and my hands, and with feet-first I would worry about my knees and my legs. I felt that running was more important to me, with my legs, so I started going head-first. I got my [...] technique from airplanes...I was on a plane and asleep and the plane bounced and when we landed we bounced and it woke me up. Then the next flight I had the same pilot and the plane went down so smooth. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> the pilot why, and he said when you land a plane smooth, you get the plane elevated to the lowest position you can and then you smooth it in. Same with sliding... If you dive when you're running straight up then you have a long distance to get to the ground. But the closer you get to the ground the less time it will take... I was hitting the dirt so smooth, so fast, when I hit the dirt, there wasn't no hesitation. It was like a skid mark, like you throw a rock on the water and skid off it. So when I hit the ground, if you didn't have the tag down, I was by you. No matter if the ball beat me, I was by you. That was what made the close plays go my way, I think." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{was an old}} {{theory that}} maybe Arnold had seen wind {{whipping}} snow along the mountain ridges, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> Air Force investigators about this. I got a flat [...] "Impossible." ...|$|E

2500|$|You know, {{its engine}} sound was {{different}} from other planes; that is, the president's engine's sound ... We were looking towards where the plane was coming from, and we saw a projectile and we saw a ball of flame or flash and we saw the plane go down; and I saw it. I {{was the leader of}} the bloc <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> the soldiers to get up and I told them [...] "Get up because Kinani [...] has been shot down.' They told me, [...] "You are lying." [...] I said, [...] "It's true." [...] So I opened my wardrobe, I put on my uniform and I heard the bugle sound.|$|E
2500|$|When I {{imagined}} {{the music that}} would match the epic story and visuals of the drama, Misia's overwhelmingly powerful and bittersweet voice was all that came to mind. I {{wanted it to be}} touching and nostalgic and for it to bring to life the earnestness of the people from the Edo period and the feeling of a love that transcends time, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> Misia to write an epic ballad like only she can. Once I heard the song, I became even more confident in the drama and am certain it will liven up the production [...] I want the viewers to focus on the lyrics, as they may be hinting at the climax of the drama.|$|E
2500|$|Cheung {{distinguished}} {{himself as}} a Canto-pop singer through embodying the politics, sexual and gender identity of a queer subject position. He announced his gay relationship with Daffy Tong during a concert in 1997, earning him prestige in LGBT communities in China, Japan, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. In a 2001 interview with Time magazine, Cheung said: [...] "It's more appropriate to say I'm bisexual. I've had girlfriends. When I was 22 or <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> my girlfriend Teresa Mo (...) to marry me.", but was unsuccessful. In two interviews in 1992 and 2002, Cheung also stated that [...] "My mind is bisexual. It's {{easy for me to}} love a woman. It's also easy for me to love a man too" [...] and [...] "I believe that a good actor would be androgynous, and ever changing," [...] referencing his performance of intersexuality, androgynous dressing, and gay femininity in his music videos and films.|$|E
5000|$|In September 2008, Geagea {{pronounced}} {{in front of}} thousands of rallying supporters in Jounieh a historical apology. The apology read: [...] "I fully apologize for all the mistakes that we committed when we were carrying out our national duties during past civil war years,... <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> God to forgive, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> the people whom we hurt in the past." ...|$|R
60|$|From you, my dear Basil, the confidant of {{my hopes}} toward Noto, I know I may look for sympathy {{now that my}} {{advances}} have met with such happy issue, however incomplete be my account. And <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you to be my best man in the matter before the world.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is not so," [...] {{answered}} Leo earnestly. [...] "As one man to another, I {{tell you}} it is not <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> no smile of your wife and no acre of your soil. Be wise and help us to be gone, and live on undisturbed in such fashion as may please you." ...|$|R
2500|$|Angus {{returned}} to Australia while Julia {{spent the rest}} of a year travelling. Julia later recalled, [...] " [...] was writing amazing songs ... had shown me how to play guitar in Bolivia, and those songs had gotten me through that year". She elaborated [...] "At that time the guitar was a new thing for me. I'd just bought it because I wanted to start learning. So we're {{in the middle of the}} jungle in Chalalan with this guitar and Angus was playing us these songs he'd been writing. I hadn't really been around him that much for the last couple of years – once I finished school I moved in with my boyfriend and Angus was off surfing and skating – and all of a sudden we're in the middle of the jungle and he's singing these songs that are so beautiful <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him to teach me some songs and that was the start of learning guitar and our friendship, I suppose, and the start of us having this amazing experience".|$|E
2500|$|Although Beckett {{refused to}} be drawn on the {{backgrounds}} of the characters, this has not stopped actors looking for their own motivation. Jean Martin had a doctor friend called Marthe Gautier, who {{was working at the}} Salpêtrière Hospital, and he said to her: [...] "'Listen, Marthe, what could I find that would provide some kind of physiological explanation for a voice like the one written in the text?' [...] said: 'Well, {{it might be a good}} idea if you went to see the people who have Parkinson's disease.' <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> her about the disease ... She explained how it begins with a trembling, which gets more and more noticeable, until later the patient can no longer speak without the voice shaking. So I said, 'That sounds exactly what I need.'" [...] "Sam and Roger were not entirely convinced by my interpretation but had no objections." [...] When he explained to Beckett that he was playing Lucky as if he were suffering from Parkinson's, Beckett said, [...] "'Yes, of course.' He mentioned briefly that his mother had had Parkinson's, but quickly moved on to another subject." ...|$|E
2500|$|Having {{the home}} {{recording}} system also proved useful for production, the band {{felt that it}} would not only benefit themselves, but other local bands who could not afford the studio prices, even in the Welwyn Garden City area. It was here that Billy and Charlotte both stumbled upon the opportunity that would eventually prove significant for the band. [...] "I was producing a local Welwyn Garden City band in my front lounge one day and I noticed that it was quite good <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> {{if they were going to}} send it to any London venues, because I knew a few that would like it. They said that they were going to send it off to Michael Eavis who runs Glastonbury Festival, and I asked why..." [...] Michael Eavis that year was running an unsigned bands competition to play on the Other Stage, and The Subways decided that would be a great idea. [...] "It was really just another address to send one of our CDs off to. All we wanted was to play shows and this was another great opportunity. The CD we sent off to Michael Eavis was literally one among a bunch of 30 that were being sent out to London promoters for a load of gigs we wanted to book. We never expected the phone call saying that we'd won and were to play Glastonbury", said Cooper on radio. The Subways remain friends with Eavis today, and have suggested that other upcoming bands should send demos to Eavis.|$|E

2500|$|Immediately {{after taking}} {{the oath of office}} in the East Room of the White House, Ford spoke to the {{assembled}} audience in a speech broadcast live to the nation.

60|$|I {{could not}} think of any retort to this, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> if Mrs. Strickland had children.|$|E
60|$|But {{there was}} no little Em'ly to be seen, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> Mr. Peggotty where she was.|$|E

50|$|In November 1908, Josef Holý {{was invited}} to the project, but he refused {{due to lack of}} {{interest}} in the material and said “If there is not the will or the right mood, it would not turn out well, however <b>I</b> tried, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you to count me out.” With Holý gone, Janáček turned to Dr. Zikmund Janke, an ear, nose and throat doctor working both in Prague and Luhačovice.|$|R
