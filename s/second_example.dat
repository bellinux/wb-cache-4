5|$|As an example, the {{execution}} scene in The Kingdom of This World puts European and autochthonous cultures in opposition {{through the use}} of the spectator-performer relationship. In this spectacle situation, Carpentier is able to juxtapose the Europeans' experience of Macandal's body falling into the flames with the autochthonous (Afro-Haitian) experience of Macandal's body flying off the stake. Through the different, mutable views of the performance that he creates, Carpentier is able to represent an unstable cultural identity. As a <b>second</b> <b>example,</b> the scene that Ti Noel constructs around himself after the sacking of the Sans-Souci Palace presents the reader with a dramatic rehearsal in which Ti Noel represents culturally mobile subjectivity by performing different identities on his own.|$|E
5|$|The MSE {{method is}} also {{sensitive}} to secondary clustering. One {{example of this}} phenomenon is when a set of observations is thought {{to come from a}} single normal distribution, but in fact comes from a mixture normals with different means. A <b>second</b> <b>example</b> is when the data is thought to come from an exponential distribution, but actually comes from a gamma distribution. In the latter case, smaller spacings may occur in the lower tail. A high value of M(θ) would indicate this secondary clustering effect, and suggesting {{a closer look at the}} data is required.|$|E
50|$|Metabiosis {{is a more}} {{indirect}} dependency, {{in which}} one organism creates or prepares a suitable environment for a <b>second.</b> <b>Examples</b> include maggots, which feast and develop on corpses, and hermit crabs, which use gastropod shells to protect their bodies.|$|R
5000|$|Display stands are {{commonly}} manufactured from {{materials such as}} cardboard, fluted polypropylene (aka corrugated plastic or correx) and acrylic. Cardboard and Fluted polypropylene stands can be full colour printed and supplied as flat-packs, ready to assemble in <b>seconds.</b> <b>Examples</b> available here ...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between statistics and economics is analyzed from two view-points. First, the fundamental {{role played by}} statistical inference in estimating economic relations and in testing underlying hypotheses in examined. <b>Second,</b> <b>examples</b> are given to show how new ideas emerge from the detailed observation of economic facts. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{design was}} reimagined in 1944, {{intended}} to operate {{along with the}} s and proposed aircraft carriers to make up powerful task forces able to challenge the American fleet. In this role it {{would need to be}} a more powerful ship than the original design, taking over for the now-cancelled Kronstadts. They were intended to fend off enemy attacks and protect the carriers when bad weather prevented flying. A series of at least four were planned, and Stalingrad finally began construction in 1951. Supported primarily by Joseph Stalin and opposed by a considerable part of the naval staff, the project came to an abrupt end with his death in 1953. By this time a <b>second</b> <b>example</b> was under construction and abandoned on the slipway, while a third was never started. The partially completed Stalingrad ended as a target ship for testing anti-ship missiles, before being broken up around 1962.|$|E
25|$|As a <b>second</b> <b>example,</b> {{consider}} an economy {{which consists of}} a large land-estate L.|$|E
25|$|The CCW-5 {{continued}} to make developments flights during the 1960s and 1970s, but no production orders were obtained. The <b>second</b> <b>example</b> was donated to the Mid-Atlantic Air Museum at Reading Airport, Pennsylvania and is on restricted display.|$|E
5000|$|A supermajor seventh is an {{interval}} intermediate between a major seventh and an augmented seventh. It is the inverse of a subminor <b>second.</b> <b>Examples</b> of such {{an interval}} is the ratio 25:13, or 1132.10 cents (B); the ratio 27:14, or 1137.04 cents (B [...] ); and 35:18, or 1151.23 cents (C [...] ).|$|R

2500|$|Evidence {{that the}} Trunk Road and Link Road {{classification}} and numbering system had been well established by [...] the 1950s {{is found in}} [...] which contains examples of several directional signs. The first and <b>second</b> <b>examples</b> show the T8 as the route to Wexford and Rosslare. In addition, Esso road-maps of Ireland from the 1950s show the Trunk and Link road network.|$|R
25|$|In {{the first}} example above, we were {{studying}} the extension Q(√3)/Q, where Q is the field of rational numbers, and Q(√3) is the field obtained from Q by adjoining √3. In the <b>second</b> <b>example,</b> we were studying the extension Q(A,B,C,D)/Q.|$|E
25|$|The {{date of the}} RK.25's {{first flight}} is not known, though the {{prototype}} was registered in September 1928. It and the <b>second</b> <b>example</b> competed in the 1929 Challenge; the latter, with its more powerful engine and flown by John Carberry, came third.|$|E
25|$|Custer persisted {{with his}} design {{and built the}} <b>second</b> <b>example</b> N5855V at the Custer Channel Wing Corp factory. It again used a Baumann Brigadier {{fuselage}} and tail assembly. Although several firms expressed interest in production of the design, all failed to provide sufficient funds. This aircraft first flew on 19 June 1964.|$|E
30|$|Next we give a <b>second</b> {{numerical}} <b>example</b> {{on application}} of associative memories based on CVNNs.|$|R
2500|$|A <b>second</b> {{canonical}} <b>example</b> is {{two different}} kinds of matching nested parentheses, described by the productions: ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>seconds</b> <b>example</b> is also {{considered}} to be non-tense and indicated a present time frame. Again in this example, there there is no specific marker morpheme used in the sentence to indicate the time frame. Thus, whenever no -ko morpheme is included with a noun or pronoun base, one can assume the event {{took place in the}} past, in the present or happened in the near future.|$|R
25|$|The {{prototype}} first flew on 5 October 1984, {{with the}} undercarriage fixed for early testing. Development was delayed by the license production of RFB Fantrainers by the RTAF, and was eventually abandoned, only the single prototype (which is preserved at the Royal Thai Air Force Museum) being flown, with a <b>second</b> <b>example</b> {{being used for}} static testing.|$|E
25|$|The Cody biplane {{successfully}} passed all {{the tests}} and was declared {{winner of the}} competition, {{despite the fact that}} several other of the competitors (such as the Hanriot monoplanes) demonstrated better all-round performance. As a result, the Cody was purchased by the Flying Corps, with an order placed for a <b>second</b> <b>example</b> to be built by Cody.|$|E
25|$|Clearly, the <b>second</b> <b>example</b> {{is not a}} grammatically well-formed {{sentence}} in English. A child knows this and does not form sentences {{such as the one}} marked by the asterisk. How does the child know, without being explicitly taught, that the ungrammatical example is, in fact, ungrammatical? From the linguistic perspective being described here, {{the answer to this question}} is that such knowledge pre-exists as part of UG.|$|E

5000|$|Evidence {{that the}} Trunk Road and Link Road {{classification}} and numbering system had been well {{established by the}} 1950s is found in Statutory Instrument S.I. No. 284/1956 — Traffic Signs Regulations, 1956 which contains examples of several directional signs. The first and <b>second</b> <b>examples</b> show the T8 as the route to Wexford and Rosslare. In addition, Esso road-maps of Ireland from the 1950s show the Trunk and Link road network.|$|R

25|$|The Asian Test Championship is {{only the}} <b>second</b> <b>example</b> of a Test cricket tournament {{involving}} more than two teams, the first being the 1912 Triangular Tournament, which was held between Australia, England and South Africa. This tournament {{was considered to be}} the predecessor to the Test Cricket World Cup that the International Cricket Council was planning for the 9 member nations.|$|E
25|$|In 1938 {{the company}} started {{work on the}} Heston Type 5 Racer {{which was to be}} used in an attempt on the world's air speed record. The {{aircraft}} had been designed by Napier & Son and had an estimated maximum speed of 480mph. Registered G-AFOK, it first flew at Heston in June 1940 but was damaged on landing and a <b>second</b> <b>example</b> was not completed.|$|E
25|$|A <b>second</b> <b>example</b> {{from the}} {{practice}} of the Esperantists is the rental of a hall to another society. As the Esperanto Association would want to maintain the same purchasing power for its rental revenue (since the Association's expenses would be likely to increase through inflation over time) it could conclude an agreement with the tenant, expressed in Steloj but payable in the national currency according to the then-current monthly conversion rate.|$|E

25|$|Note {{that this}} clitic form {{is only for}} the verb ser and is {{restricted}} to only third-person singular conjugations. It is not used as a verb in the grammar of the sentence but introduces prepositional phrases and adds emphasis. It {{does not need to}} concord with the tense of the main verb, as in the <b>second</b> <b>example,</b> and can be usually removed from the sentence without affecting the simple meaning.|$|E
25|$|Equipped almost identically to CSX2522, this <b>second</b> <b>example</b> had {{aluminum}} valve covers, a tuned air cleaner, a Smiths heater, seat belts, {{front and}} rear brake cooling ducts, a hood scoop, brake cooling scoops, side exhausts and a painted roll bar (2522’s roll bar was chromed). Suspension options included Koni shock absorbers, {{front and rear}} anti-sway bars, unpolished six-inch magnesium pin-drive wheels, and Goodyear Blue Streak Sports Car Special tires.|$|E
25|$|The <b>second</b> <b>example</b> {{retained}} {{the same general}} arrangement but differed considerably in constructional detail. The Fabre lattice girders were replaced by conventional spars, the single interplane struts replaced by more conventional paired struts and the tail surfaces altered to a cruciform arrangement, with the rudder divided into two sections {{above and below the}} stabiliser. The trim of the aircraft could be altered on the ground by adjusting the bracing cables for the tail surfaces.|$|E
5000|$|These two {{sentences}} {{can be combined}} into a single sentence using converbs, which will relate the first action to the <b>second.</b> For <b>example,</b> ...|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for algebraic image restoration capable of treating astronomical images. For a typical 500 x 500 image, direct algebraic restoration {{would require the}} solution of a 250, 000 x 250, 000 linear system. The block iterative approach is used to reduce the problem to solving 4900 121 x 121 linear systems. The algorithm was implemented on the Goddard Massively Parallel Processor, which can solve a 121 x 121 system in approximately 0. 06 <b>seconds.</b> <b>Examples</b> are shown of the results for various astronomical images...|$|R
2500|$|Evidence {{that the}} Trunk Road and Link Road {{classification}} and numbering system had been well established by [...] the 1950s {{is found in}} [...] which contains examples of several directional signs. The first and <b>second</b> <b>examples</b> show the T8 as the route to Wexford and Rosslare. In addition, Esso road-maps of Ireland from the 1950s show the Trunk and Link road network. Despite its long-standing use, the original Trunk and Link road system was never legislated for and the routes of Trunk Roads and Link Roads were never formally designated by law.|$|R
