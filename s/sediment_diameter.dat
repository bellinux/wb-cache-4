In this work the bed profile variation is simulated, by using a numerical model proposed in previous works, in function of the variation of the friction factor, that reflects the coarsening of median <b>sediment</b> <b>diameter,</b> due to armouring process, and the variation of flow conditions. The variation of grains-size distribution of the bed material is predicted by using a probabilistic approach and the median <b>sediment</b> <b>diameter</b> and the dimensions of bed forms are estimated at each time step.

40|$|Sediment {{transport}} models require appropriate {{representation of}} near-bed processes. We aim here {{to explore the}} parameterizations of bed shear stress, bed load transport rate and near-bed sediment erosion rate under the sheet flow regime. To that end, we employ a one-dimensional two-phase sheet flow model which is able to resolve the intrawave boundary layer and sediment dynamics at a length scale {{on the order of}} the sediment grain. We have conducted 79 numerical simulations to cover a range of collinear wave and current conditions and <b>sediment</b> <b>diameters</b> in the range 210 – 460 μm. The numerical results confirm that the intrawave bed shear stress leads the free stream velocity, and we assess an explicit expression relating the phase lead to the maximum velocity, wave period and bed roughness. The numerical sheet flow model is also used to provide estimates for the bed load transport rate and to inspect the near-bed sediment erosion. A common bed load transport rate formulation and two typical reference concentration approaches are assessed. A dependence of the bed load transport rate on the <b>sediment</b> grain <b>diameter</b> is observed and parameterized. Finally, the intrawave near-bed vertical sediment flux is further investigated and related to the time derivative of the bed shear stress. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an erosion model, ARMOUR, which simulates time-varying runoff, erosion, deposition and surface armour evolution down a hillslope {{either as a}} result of a single erosion event or as the cumulative impact of many events over periods up to decades. ARMOUR simulates sediment transport for both cohesive and non-cohesive soil and dynamically differentiates between transport-limited and source-limited processes. A variety of feasible processes for entrainment of different size classes can be modelled and evaluated against data. The generalized likelihood of uncertainty estimation (GLUE) technique was used to calibrate and validate ARMOUR using data collected during rainfall simulator experiments at two contrasting sites: (1) non-cohesive stony sediments at Ranger Uranium Mine, Northern Territory, Australia; and (2) cohesive silty sediments at Northparkes Gold Mine, NSW, Australia. The spatial and temporal variations of model predictions within the individual runoff events showed that some entrainment processes could not model the spikes in concentration and subsequent depletion, while the hiding model of Andrews and Parker best simulated the concentration trends for both calibrated and independent runoff events. ARMOUR also successfully captured the coarsening of the surface material, though small, over the duration of the rainfall simulator trials. This was driven by the depletion of the finest size class of the soil. For a constant discharge, ARMOUR simulated higher sediment flux at the start of the storm with the sediment flux and concentration diminishing with time. For natural rainfall a power law relationship between sediment flux and discharge was observed. The calibration exercise showed that sediment concentration and discharge alone are insufficient to calibrate all aspects of the physics, in particular the armour depth. This appears to be because the armouring during the short duration events is driven by depletion of the finest classes of the <b>sediments</b> (<b>diameters</b> less then 62 · 5 mm), which are not normally measured...|$|R

40|$|Modelling the morphodynamic {{evolution}} of rivers due to flow-driven sediment transport requires {{the adoption of}} a flow model, such as the shallow water equations, and a conservation equation for sediment mass (the Exner equation). When dealing with mixtures of grain sizes, one can account for the interaction among sediment transport, bed level variation and development of bed stratigraphy using a grainsize-specific form of the sediment conservation equation. Hirano (1971) was the first to develop such a continuity model. He introduced a sediment exchange layer (the "active layer") providing a source of sediments to be entrained in the flow and regulating the exchange with the substrate layer located underneath. The active layer model requires a closure relation for the (time varying) active layer thickness. The classical approach is to assume for it a constant value, which deeply affects the celerity of sorting waves (Ribberink, 1987). A preferable approach, however, is to link its value to physical properties of the river bed, such as some reference <b>sediment</b> <b>diameter</b> in the plane bed case or the dune height in the bedform-dominated case (e. g.

40|$|Research {{of river}} bed erosion is an {{important}} part of designing bridges and transportation networks since the stability and hydrodynamic response of bridges critically depends on river bed scour. The engineering designers traditionally focus on the local scour around hydraulic structures, such as piers and abutments, in open channel flow. The pressurized scour under a submerged bridge deck is seldom researched. ^ In this study, the commercial CFD codes, FLOW 3 D and STARCCM+, are adopted to simulate pressure scour under a bridge deck with six girders. Several limitations for FLOW 3 D are found during its application of sediment transport model: (a) the scour model is sensitive to the vertical cell size on the sediment interface, the scour holes impossibly form for the large cell size; (b) large <b>sediment</b> <b>diameters</b> fail the drifting model comprised of the scour model; (c) the bed load model cannot be available to simulate the saltation load; (d) large computational times are required to obtain the scour results. In STARCCM+, the morphing vertices model on the wall boundary can effectively mock the deformation of river bed dependent on the entrainment rate for sediment transport model that we adopt. Guo 2 ̆ 7 s empirical formulas for pressurized scour profile and time dependent scour depth are incorporated into STARCCM+ as the model of morphing mesh. The recession rate is obtained as the function of the maximum bed shear stress by fitting the numerical results. ^ A theoretical model for analyzing the sediment bed load with arbitrary bed slopes is developed to calculate the erosion profile on the sediment bed in flow condition. It found that the entrainment rate of sediment particles is also dependent on the changing rate of bed load layer thickness and mixture density from the continuity equation compared to Exner equation. Further, the two dimensional solution shows that the additional shear stress due to the longitudinal slope has an important influence on the bed shear. The modified pressure drop formula based on Ergun equation is developed to compute the gradient of pressure drop for a fluidized bed as well. ^ The results of this research provide an effective approach to analyze the scour profile with the combination of theoretical and numerical computation. ...|$|R

The reason being that gradual sediment formation behind the reservoir can reduce the nominal capacity of these dams. The aim of the present paper is to analytically investigate sedimentation process along the river course and behind the storage reservoirs {{in general and the}} Eastern Intake of the Dez Diversion weir in particular using the SHARC software. Results of the model indicated the water level at 115. 97 m whereas the real time measurement from the river cross section was 115. 98 m which suggests a significantly close relation between them. The average transported sediment load in the river was measured at 0. 25 mm, from which it can be concluded that nearly 100 % of the suspended loads in river are moving which suggests no sediment settling but indicates that almost all sediment loads enters into the intake. It was further showed the average <b>sediment</b> <b>diameter</b> entering the intake to be 0. 293 mm which in turn suggests that about 85 % of suspended sediments in the river entre the intake.

40|$|Literature survey {{made in this}} {{research}} indicated that the roughness has {{a significant effect on}} the design of a self-cleansing sewer. A conceptual model was therefore developed taking into account the effect of roughness in the sediment transport in sewers. This model was later tested against experimental data obtained from a test rig. The rig had a pipe which was specially fabricated in two halves so that it could be divided to coat the interior with uniform sand grains to provide roughness. The experimental data shows a good correlation with the model developed. Two relationships i. e. for smooth and rough pipes, were derived from the results. The effects of volumetric <b>sediment</b> concentration, pipe <b>diameter,</b> <b>sediment</b> size and effective roughness on these relationships were in turn examined. Head loss formulae acquired by past researchers were slightly modified to suit the range covered by the experimental data. The relationships developed in {{this research}} were subsequently applied to sewer design. These were later compared to the criterion of 0. 76 m/s proposed by the British Standards. In the case of smooth pipes, it shows conclusively that the criterion of 0. 76 m/s produces excessive slopes for pipe diameter up to 1. 0 metre. However, for rough pipes the criterion gives insufficient slopes to maintain a self-cleansing sewer. This is valid up to a pipe diameter of 0. 3 metre. Beyond this diameter the criterion gives high slopes. Comparisons were also made with studies in the wider field of sediment transport on fixed bed. These have set in context the proposed formulae for smooth and rough pipes in the design of storm sewers...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of suspended sediment and plankton throughout the upper 275 m of water over San Pedro Basin, California, was observed on 4 cruises in 1957 - 58. In general, plankton concentrations varied inversely with depth while suspendccl sediment concentrations varied inversely with distance from shore. On 3 of the cruises, localized {{high concentrations of}} 2 -p <b>diameter</b> <b>sediment</b> were found near the bottom at depths between 200 and 275 m. Evidence of entrainment and subsequent sinking of plankton along with the suspended sedi-ment suggests turbiclity currents originating within the upper 50 m on the continental shelf.

40|$|Sediments on the innelr {{portion of}} the Oregon {{continental}} shelf consist of clean, well-sorted, detrital sand. This sand has an aver-age median diameter of 2. 53 (. 173 mm) and is both positively and negatively skewed. Deposits with median diameters in the coarse sand and gravel classes occur at depths of 20 to 40 fathoms and probably represent ancient beach or fluviatile deposits formed during lower stands of sea level. The outer shelf and upper slope are covered by poorly sorted <b>sediments</b> with median <b>diameters</b> in the fine sand to fine silt classes. Mean <b>diameters</b> of the <b>sediments</b> are almost always smaller than their median <b>diameters</b> and the <b>sediments</b> are positively skewed. The heavy mineral assemblages are dominated by the amphi-bole and pyroxene groups and the opaque-garnet association. Pyroxenes are most abundant in the coarser-grained sediments of Redacted for Privac...|$|R
