30|$|There is a {{claim that}} the {{self-regulation}} of childcare fees {{will contribute to the}} enhancement of childcare service through competition in service, with the view that regulations on prices cause poor quality childcare service. Furthermore, since options for consumers will be expanded according {{to a wide range of}} service price options, the market for childcare will be revitalized, even contributing to the support of high-income groups. However, the adoption of a self-regulating price mechanism means that the Government will have to surrender the public nature of childcare, because the service provided for young children will be graded according to the incomes of their parents, resulting <b>in</b> deepening <b>socio-economic</b> <b>polarization.</b> <b>In</b> terms of private childcare, there is a degree of opposition to self-regulation because price competition rather than service competition is likely to cause those facilities in poor condition to be neglected.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} consequences of internal migration to Santa Cruz, an expanding urban center in lowland Bolivia whose growth stems from uneven regional development. Regional divisions between the highlands and the lowlands have long afflicted Bolivia. The roots of the regional differences predate the country's independence, but they have intensified {{in the past decade}} amid unresolved power struggles between Bolivia's central government and the opposition based in the lowland region, as recent events in Bolivia over regional autonomies have demonstrated. Drawing on the perspectives of political geography, urban planning, and sociology, this study examines the processes of migrant integration and social exclusion in Santa Cruz, and how migration is affecting regional identity formation in Bolivia's lowland region. In Chapter 2, I explore the historical construction of the eastern lowlands region, called the Oriente. I trace its transformation from an isolated frontier to Bolivia's major production zone and the emergence of the regional elite though periods of economic change based on extractive industries. Chapter 3 shifts the focus to the city of Santa Cruz and argues that modernist planning in the 1950 s and 1960 s did not coincide with the realities of mass urban migration that ensued. I also suggest that migration-induced population growth and shifts in the local economy toward services and informal employment are creating particular patterns of urban growth and deepening <b>socio-economic</b> <b>polarization.</b> <b>In</b> Chapter 4, I analyze migrant integration and social exclusion through migrant interviews in several urban districts, the ways that civil society organizations potentially intermediate between migrants and longerterm residents, and connections between migrants and local institutions. Chapter 5 examines the connections between migration flows, growth of the informal economy, and conflicts over public space in Santa Cruz as a window into the dynamics of migrant integration and exclusion. I investigate the spatial dimensions of informal commerce in the city and analyze a municipal plan for reorganization of public markets, as well as contrasting visions of public space from planners, long-term residents, informal workers, and migrants. In the perspective taken here, struggles over public space reflect unresolved tensions around race, ethnicity, and space in a changing city...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. T. R. P.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2009. Currently, {{the global}} agenda of {{sustainability}} {{and sustainable development}} have become the yardstick to which human activities are measured. The concept of sustainability is known to contain directives, when implemented will ensure that resources are used in ways that can benefit current and future generations. The ways in which spatial planning and urban development occur have also become relevant in this respect. Within this premise, urban form has also become relevant to the urban sustainability. Umhlanga Ridge Town Centre is a private development modeled {{on the concept of}} New Urbanism. The concept of New Urbanism is known to contain elements which respond positively to current urban challenges such as urban sprawl, increased pollution from automobile dependency and <b>socio-economic</b> <b>polarization.</b> <b>In</b> essence, New Urbanism purports to contribute towards urban sustainability. The main objective of this research has been to ascertain {{the extent to which the}} current developments in Umhlanga Ridge satisfy the principles of New Urbanism and urban sustainability. This included the identification of appropriate indicators of a sustainable urban form. Emphasis was made on how the indicators of urban form had manifested in the development of Umhlanga Ridge Town Centre and the impacts they have had on identified urban challenges in the Ethekwini Municipality. The rationale was that sustainable urban development must be able to address local urban challenges and promote sustainable practices within the private and the public domain. The methodology for this research included the use of secondary and primary sources. Interviews were conducted with Tongaat Hulett Development in their capacity as a land owner and planners of the Umhlanga Ridge Town Centre. The Ethekwini Municipality was also interviewed with respect to what impacts this development had had on their overall long-term development strategy. Three renowned planners who had adequate knowledge of urban development trends in the Ethekwini Municipality were also interviewed. A questionnaire survey was undertaken with users of the Umhlanga Ridge Town Centre to gain their perceptions on urban form in relation to their needs. The research revealed that the application of New Urbanism in the development of Umhlanga Ridge Town Centre was partly an investment initiative for profit-maximisation as well as a response to sustainable practices in urban development. Being part of a major investment node in the Ethekwini region, it had contributed towards job creation and enhanced the economic base of the region. However, it was found to have partially fulfilled the principles of New Urbanism used in the assessment. It was concluded that the application of New Urbanism in urban development was not adequate to achieve urban sustainability but provided lessons which can be learnt such the use of high densities to enhance compaction and the creation of a living environment which supported non-motorised forms of transport. Private sector participation and buy-in into the long-term vision of regions had also become necessary to enhance the adoption of sustainable practices into the future...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} idea that how wealth is {{distributed}} across social groups (ethnic or language groups, gender, etc.) fundamentally affects the evolution of economic inequality. By providing microfoundations suitable for this exploration, this paper hopes to enhance our understanding of when social forces contribute to the reproduction of economic inequality, and what the relevant policy implications might be. In tackling this issue, this paper offers contributions in two domains. First, it adds a dimension to the literature on social capital. Second, it offers a modest generalization of the concepts of identity, alienation and economic polarization used by Esteban and Ray (1994). This generalization permits us to consider the multiple characteristics that shape social identity, inclusion and exclusion. It also underwrites a higher-order measure of <b>socio-economic</b> <b>polarization</b> that permits us to explore the hypothesis of Frances Stewart and others that economic inequality is most pernicious and persistent when it is socially embedded. Among other things {{we are able to}} show that holding constant the initial levels of economic polarization and inequality, increases <b>in</b> <b>socio-economic</b> <b>polarization</b> deepe...|$|R
