Malone was placed in command of a new Territorial unit, the 11th Regiment (Taranaki Rifles). It was during this time that he introduced {{the use of the}} [...] "lemon squeezer" [...] hat to the Territorial Force. By having his troops push out its crown and indenting its sides, the hat mirrored the outline of Mount Taranaki, thereby providing a link for the regiment to its parent region, and, more practically, allowed rain to easily run off the hat. In later years, the lemon <b>squeezer</b> hat was formally adopted by the New Zealand Military Forces.|$|E

From south to north, the trail summits many small mountains under [...] in elevation, its highest point in New York being Prospect Rock at , and {{less than half a}} mile (800m) from the border with New Jersey. The trail continues north, climbing near Fitzgerald Falls, passing through Sterling Forest State Park, and then entering Harriman State Park and Bear Mountain State Park. In Harriman State Park, the trail passes through the [...] famous Lemon <b>Squeezer,</b> a narrow crack between huge boulders. At Bear Mountain State Park, it goes through the park zoo, where the lowest point on the entire AT, at [...] above sea level, is located in front of the bear cage. Immediately afterward it crosses the Hudson River on the Bear Mountain Bridge, then climbs into Hudson Highlands State Park where it follows a ridge over several low-elevation peaks. It then passes through Fahnestock State Park and continues northeast and crosses the Metro-North Railroad's Harlem Line at Pawling, which is also the only train station {{along the length of the}} trail. It enters Connecticut via the Pawling Nature Reserve. The section of the trail that passes through Harriman and Bear Mountain State Parks is the oldest section of the trail, completed in 1923. The Appalachian Trail in New York is maintained and updated by the New York–New Jersey Trail Conference.|$|E

40|$|Broadband {{multimode}} <b>squeezers</b> {{constitute a}} powerful quantum resource with promising potential for different applications in quantum information {{technologies such as}} information coding in quantum communication networks or quantum simulations in higher dimensional systems. However, the characterization of a large array of <b>squeezers</b> that coexist in a single spatial mode is challenging. In this paper we address this problem and propose a straightforward method {{to determine the number}} of <b>squeezers</b> and their respective squeezing strengths by using broadband multimode correlation function measurements. These measurements employ the large detection windows of state of the art avalanche photodiodes to simultaneously probe the full Hilbert space of the generated state, which enables us to benchmark the squeezed states. Moreover, due to the structure of correlation functions, our measurements are not affected by losses. This is a significant advantage, since detectors with low efficiencies are sufficient. Our approach is less costly than full state tomography methods relying on multimode homodyne detection which build on much more demanding measurement and analysis tools and appear to be impractical for large Hilbert spaces.

40|$|Synthesis of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen {{entangled}} state [...] - {{the primary}} entangled resource in continuous-variable quantum-optical information processing [...] - is a technological challenge of great importance. Here we propose {{and implement a}} new scheme of generating this state. Two nonlinear optical crystals, positioned back-to-back in the waist of a pump beam, function as single-pass degenerate optical parametric amplifiers and produce single-mode squeezed vacuum states in orthogonal polarization modes, {{but in the same}} spatiotemporal mode. A subsequent pair of waveplates acts as a beam splitter, entangling the two polarization modes to generate the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen state. This technique takes advantage of the strong nonlinearity associated with type-I phase-matching configuration {{while at the same time}} eliminating the need for actively stabilizing the optical phase between the two <b>squeezers,</b> which typically arises if these <b>squeezers</b> are spatially separated. We demonstrate our method in an experiment, preparing a 1. 4 dB two-mode squeezed state and characterizing it via two-mode homodyne tomography. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

40|$|The {{exhibition}} {{explores the}} humour and quirkiness present within current design/craft {{practice in the}} UK. Simultaneously, the show significantly addresses cultural differences and the inter-cultural importance of food and ceramic kitchenware articles, locating British design aesthetic in a contemporary worldwide framework. The lemon <b>squeezers</b> began as a one-off piece and shifted quickly from studio production into factory manufacture, endorsed by coverage {{in the press and}} retail sales (e. g. The Conran Shop, Heal’s and Liberty’s, as well as Japan, Singapore and the USA.) The design of the lemon <b>squeezers</b> were the result of investigations into domestic objects and how a design for a functional object could be conceived as a theatrical piece as well as functioning as a kitchen utensil, which the Philippe Starck Juicy Salif juicer (1988) exemplifies. The object no longer needs to be hidden away when not in use but can be utilised as a display piece produced in various colours and decorative possibilities. The exhibits represent makers who produce gallery pieces and are a mixture of traditional craft-makers or potters, whilst other work is representative of designers who produce ware in a studio batch production environment. Other contributors work with industry and high-volume production runs. The lemon <b>squeezers</b> were developed during a 6 week study trip to Lisbon in association with the Royal College of Art and ARCO – the Centre de Arte e Communicacao Visual in Lisbon. The design was developed from studies of Manueline Architecture from the Monastery of the Heronymites and studies at Belem Tower and the Museu de Marinha in Belem. Drawings and studies were made of the vaulted ceilings and the intricate stone carvings of leaf and floral details on the pillars within the nave of the Monastery.
