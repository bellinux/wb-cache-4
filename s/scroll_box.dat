2500|$|The {{earliest}} yūrei-zu {{is considered}} to be by Maruyama Ōkyo (円山 応挙), founder of the Maruyama school {{and one of the most}} significant artists of the 18th century. The Ghost of Oyuki (Oyuki no maboroshi - お雪の幻) is a silk scroll painting dating to the second half of the 18th century [...] In Maruyama’s naturalistic style, it depicts a faintly coloured female ghost whose body tapers into transparency. It has been described as an “image of haunting beauty.” According to a <b>scroll</b> <b>box</b> inscription by a one-time owner, the subject of the painting is Maruyama’s lover, a geisha who died young. Her ghost is said to have visited the artist in a dream and inspired him to paint her portrait.|$|E

50|$|The game is {{essentially}} a side <b>scrolling</b> <b>boxing</b> game where the player moves left and right to control a screen sized boxer. When the timing is right, the player can unleash a final blow punch which can sometimes KO the opponent in a single strike. The home versions contained a spectator mode where the player can watch their favorite boxers compete.|$|R
5000|$|In 1985, GEM used a proportionally-sized [...] "scroll box" [...] thumb, but {{otherwise}} operated identically to the Macintosh. The net {{result was a}} modern scrollbar that looked and felt no different to the scrollbar in Windows today. GEM allowed the mouse to be moved {{far away from the}} scrollbar after clicking and holding, to reduce hand-eye coordination problems.AmigaOS followed later in the year, also with proportionally-sized <b>scroll</b> <b>boxes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Events vary, some events {{only the}} top three or so will get a prize, usually an item of some sorts. Users are {{notified}} of an upcoming event by a <b>scrolling</b> <b>box</b> {{at the top of}} the game screen. Events are known to bring an influx of players to the event's respective locations, which generally causes massive connection lag and sometimes even disconnections. The large amount of special effects during an event can significantly slow down the player's PC.|$|R

5000|$|Other chapels {{were added}} to the {{original}} edifice. Notable is the octagonal Capella di Sant'Aquilino (chapel of St Aquilino), adjoining the main church to the south. The chapel, which may have originally been built as an imperial Roman mausoleum, features important 4th-century Paleochristian mosaics. Among the mosaics is included a formulaic depiction of Jesus, as [...] "Christ the Lawgiver" [...] ("Traditio Legis" [...] - [...] "handing over the law") or possibly [...] "Christ the teacher." [...] Jesus is seated on a throne, flanked by a [...] "school" [...] of his Apostles, with a <b>scroll</b> <b>box</b> at his feet. [...] The chapel was later dedicated to the martyr Saint Aquilino of Milan (or Saint Aquilinus of Cologne), with his remains being housed in the chapel. [...] A 17th-century reliquary ark for the saint was crafted by Lombardian architect Carlo Garavaglia (flourished 1634-1635). The fresco The Rediscovery of the corpse of Saint Aquilinus of Cologne, by Carlo Urbino, decorates the wall behind the main altar in the Sant'Aquilino chapel.|$|E

But today it has come to an end.After years of living my dream, the age, the miles, and the injuries have told me {{that it is time to}} call it a career. I know in my heart that I can still perform but I would never allow myself to give you the fans anything less that the very best I have to offer. I love this business and I always want what is best for it and for you the fans. My wars have come to an end and I thank you from the bottom of my heart for sharing them with me.There are so many people to thank and I have tried to highlight a few names in the <b>scrolling</b> <b>box</b> on the side of the screen. In truth it doesn't scratch the surface of all the people that helped forge this incredible journey. But it is my attempt to pinpoint some people who have significantly helped me over the years.To my friends and family.

'Project 4' (2007-2011), included themes of homeland, territory and belonging, and its motifs included fire, water, <b>boxes,</b> <b>scrolls,</b> books, feet, bricks, bubbles and Buddha-like seated figures.|$|R
40|$|Tree of Fortune was a {{major public}} artwork {{comprising}} of 130 LED <b>scrolling</b> text <b>boxes</b> distributed throughout a large tree. Each module displayed an individual scrolling message presented in red LED text, created in collaboration with Brisbane writer Linda Carolli. The work was commissioned for and presented in a prominent riverbank location at Christchurch’s 2004 Biennial. It {{was accompanied by a}} high quality catalogue publication. [...] - The project sought to foster private reflection amongst its viewers around the context of contemporary ecological crises, whilst also calling upon the power of their imagining as a method for retaining positive and critical mindsets in the face of adversity. This was achieved through ostensibly presenting texts in the form of ‘fortune cookie’ style statements, but then configuring them to require a personal response. This sense of unraveling questions and answers was further cemented through the qualities of each scrolling text, which only revealed a small part of each phrase at any one time. ...|$|R

25|$|To {{prevent the}} {{succession}} tragedy which {{he himself had}} faced, the Yongzheng Emperor {{was said to have}} ordered his third son Hongshi (an ally of Yinsi) to commit suicide. He also devised a system for his successors to choose their heirs in secret. He wrote his chosen successor's name on two scrolls, placed one scroll in a sealed box and had the box stored behind the stele in the Qianqing Palace. He kept the other copy with him or hid it. After his death, the officials would compare the <b>scroll</b> in the <b>box</b> with the copy he had kept. If they were deemed identical, the person whose name was on the paper would be the new emperor.|$|R
40|$|In {{a two-week}} {{residential}} game camp {{we used the}} Greenfoot IDE to teach java programming to rising 9 th and 10 th graders. Students created their own computer games which required learning how to write java programs, create a game design, and create art assets. In this paper {{we focus on the}} computer science pedagogy used and describe the initial design of an augmented game development framework for the Greenfoot environment. This framework includes classes for the following useful game elements: Animation, Projectiles, Side <b>Scrolling</b> Worlds, Text <b>Boxes,</b> Clocks and Timers. We describe these classes, discuss the effectiveness of each, and describe potential improvements to their implementation and design.

50|$|The clue {{directed}} {{teams to}} {{the port city of}} Sur and a ferry crossing in Baith Al Battha where they received their next clue. This was for a Detour, a choice between Camel or Watchtower. In Camel, teams first had to make their way across the creek on a ferry to opposite bank, where they had to lift a camel into a pickup truck using a winch. Then, they had to use a map to drive 1 mi to a Bedouin Camp and deliver the camel to obtain their next clue. In Watchtower, teams had to cross the river and search in three watchtowers for an Arabian message <b>box</b> <b>scroll.</b> However, not every watchtower had a scroll. After they found it, they had to travel 1 mi to a silver shop (Al-Sayegh Gold and Silversmith) to a man called Mubarek to obtain their next clue.|$|R

The paper is also illustrated with with two paper pulp stenciled steam punk images made by Donna. Each image was sprayed using 4 colors of pulp through 2 or 3 stencils. The spray pulp was made from old colored rags with no added pigaments. The scroll is bound in a unique box structure made with paper pulp stenciled handmade paper and California walnut. The box also features wooden sprocket cranks made from striaght grain maple, inscribed with the word 'close' and an arrow indicating the direction to rotate the sprocket to return the <b>scroll</b> into the <b>box.</b> There is a pencil attached {{to the end of}} the scrolling text to restrain it from slipping into the box" [...] Artists' website...|$|R
40|$|Unbearable Lightness was {{a public}} artwork of 110 LED <b>scrolling</b> text <b>boxes</b> {{distributed}} throughout the canopy of a large, mature tree, located in a high traffic location in a major Brisbane Parkland. The work was a major commission for the Southbank Corporation Public Art Program and was exhibited during the three months around Christmas and New Year 2003. Each text module displayed individual LED scrolling messages developed during collaboration with locally based hypertext writer, Linda Carolli. Set {{during the time of}} the highly contentious Invasion of Iraq, the texts posed open questions around the themes of lightness, thinness and emptiness with the aim of promoting contentions of hope in a time of painful impotence for concerned citizens. [...] - The text modules were positioned in sympathy with the position of major constellations in the night sky at that time whilst the design alluded to Martin Luther’s original Christmas tree envisaged as a mixture of ‘stars’ seen via a tree. The tree was further outlined and highlighted with blue spotlights set within its crown. The project required the design, networking and ruggedisation of the work’s waterproof electronic modules – assisted by an electronic designer. These modules were later re-purposed into a range of other works and formats. [...] - Set within the context of major antiwar protests of that era, the project sought to foster private reflection amongst its viewers whilst also calling upon the power of their personal and collective imagining as a method for retaining positive and critical mindsets in the face of such painful social and political adversities. The work became a strong focus of attention within the park and generated nightly debate and enthusiastic spoken reading sessions. ...|$|R
40|$|Whisper Our Futures was an invited design {{proposal}} {{to produce a}} major public artwork for the State of Queensland’s 150 th Anniversary Celebrations. It involved a network of 100 individual <b>scrolling</b> digital text <b>boxes</b> each with individual audio systems arranged together in a tessellated format. This form (specified by the originating brief) both mimicked the soaring gothic arches typical of Queensland cathedrals and was also suggestive of their stained glass windows. Each text module presented a message in both visual and audible forms for Queenslanders living 150 years hence - spoken both {{by the general public}} aw well as prominent figures. In this way the work was designed as a focus of future hope, historical reflection and inspiration to visitors to Queensland cathedrals throughout the entire year of celebrations (2009). The work was planned to premiere at Brisbane’s main Anglican Cathedral and then tour to nine other state cathedrals throughout 2009. [...] Two staged proposals and budgets were invited throughout 2007. After the second successful proposal stage the State Premier and cabinet changed, ultimately leading the public art components to be dropped from the program. The proposal currently remains on file at the Queensland Premiers Office. ...|$|R
