40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of agricultural intensity, various farming practices, landscape composition and vegetation cover on the abundance and species richness of wintering farmland birds, assessed simultaneously across seven European regions. The abundance and species richness of wintering farmland birds were negatively affected by agricultural intensity. The effects of yield and farm type were interlinked. Of the 10 farming practices assessed, mechanical weeding and the amount of organic fertilizer applied negatively affected farmland birds, presumably due to reduced food availability on arable fields. Positive effects of organic farming on farmland birds proved to be limited to simplified landscapes. More farmland birds were observed in areas with more <b>stubble,</b> <b>pasture</b> and green manure crops. Species richness was higher in areas with more pasture. The results of this study show that farm management, vegetation cover and landscape composition all influence wintering farmland birds. Heterogeneous landscapes comprising arable crops as well as grasslands support most species of farmland birds in winter. The effectiveness of organic farming and agri-environment schemes depends on landscape composition. Therefore, different agri-environment schemes should be designed for different landscape type...|$|E
40|$|The {{pattern of}} several {{physiological}} parameters such as body temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate, haematocrit, Hb content, which {{are closely related}} to thermoregulatory potential, have been investigated with the purpose to assess shearing and sheltering influence on thermoregulation. Thirty clinically healthy and well-fed yearling ewes, Comisana breed, aged 8 months, underwent this trial. 7 days prior to the beginning of this study, all subjects were equally distributed in three groups with different sheltering conditions: group A was kept in an outdoor pen, group B was kept in a pen equipped with a shady net (80 % of shading) and group C was kept in an outdoor sheepfold with an attached paddock. As to feeding conditions, groups A and B were fed daily on: hay (2 kg), wheat straw (1 kg), wheat concentrate (0. 5 kg) and water ad libitum; the remaining ewes grazed on a wheat <b>stubble</b> <b>pasture</b> for 6 h/day, and were sheltered during midday warmer hours. Through a simultaneous monitoring equipment (Schiller Argus Tm 7) and a blood collection by means of a jugular venipuncture parameters assessment was carried out for each subject before shearing and during the following five days at a fixed time during morning. A Student T test was applied to determine any statistic significance between groups and within each group. Statistically significant differences were observed for all parameters under investigations. These results suggest that shearing is brings about adaptive responses, which are influenced by shelter conditions as well. More specifically, obtained results underline that shading net provides a more comfortable microclimatic environment...|$|E

Pollen of Artemisia, Cannabis, Chenopodiaceae and Rumex can come from neglected areas of both {{the city and its}} surroundings, as well as from <b>stubble</b> <b>pastures.</b> Betula, Juglans, Pinus, Platanus, Taxus and Tilia species have been planted exclusively in public places and gardens; they have no natural habitats in the Szeged region. However, since the 1960 s Pinus (Pinus sylvestris and Pinus nigra) species have been extensively planted in the sandy regions north-west of Szeged within the framework of an afforestation programme. Their pollen can easily reach Szeged via north-western winds. Morus is planted along avenues and in public places. Plantago species occur in natural grassy areas of both the city and its surroundings. Quercus species are planted along the embankment surrounding the city, as well as north of the city. Ulmus is planted in the city too; however it is not very common there. Formerly planted Ulmus pumila, as an adventive species, also occurs, but its spread is not characteristic. Large natural stocks of Ulmus minor together with Ulmus laevis live in the oak-elm-ash alluvial forests alongside the River Maros where planted and spontaneous stocks also appear. They can be found spontaneously even in the willow-poplar alluvial forests thanks to the mature stocks of the Pécska forest on the Romanian side (Deák 2010).|$|R

2500|$|Traditionally in the American West, shepherds {{spent most}} of the year with a sheep herd, searching for the best forage in each season. This type of {{shepherding}} peaked in the late nineteenth century. Today, cattle and sheep herds are generally based on private land, although this may be {{a small part of the}} total range when all seasons are included. Some farmers who raised sheep recruited Basque shepherds to care for the herds, including managing migration between grazing lands. Workers from Peru, Chile, and Mongolia have now taken shepherd roles; the Basque have bought their own ranches or moved to urban jobs. Shepherds take the sheep into the mountains in the summer and out on the desert in the winter, at times using crop <b>stubble</b> and <b>pasture</b> on private land when it is available.

40|$|A {{simulation}} model {{was used to}} estimate changes in wool production, gross margin/ha and the most profitable stocking rate for breeding ewes, in response to increasing pasture growth rates {{at different times of}} the year, delaying the onset of flowering and increasing the digestibility of dead herbage. The model was applied to perennial pastures in western Victoria. Increases in pasture growth rate throughout the entire year were economically worthwhile if the stocking rate was increased accordingly. However, increased profitability could also be achieved by increasing pasture growth for selected periods. These increases were more valuable in late autumn and early winter than at other times of the year. Profitability could also be increased in the absence of increased stocking rate by introducing later flowering cultivars or increasing the digestibility of dead <b>pasture</b> <b>stubble.</b> Key words: flock simulation, pasture growth, utilization, digestibility...|$|R
40|$|The carcass {{and eating}} quality of sheep grazing a saltbush {{dominant}} saline pasture system or on a ‘control’ dry <b>pasture,</b> <b>stubble</b> plot both supplemented with barley for 14 weeks was investigated (Experiment 1, 50 (2 × 25) 6 month merino lamb wethers and Experiment 2, 50 (2 × 25) 18 month old merino hogget wethers). Treatment had no {{significant effect on}} eating quality attributes (P > 0. 05). Saltbush grazed sheep in both experiments had a significantly (P < 0. 01) lower carcass fat and significantly higher lean (P < 0. 01) content than the control grazed sheep. This is a positive finding as fat denudation is a significant cost to processors. The long term consumption of saltbush and barley prior to slaughter did increase muscle fluid content (P < 0. 05) but {{did not result in}} a decreased carcass weight loss at slaughter due to confounding changes in body composition. Grazing saltbush resulted in increased urine weight (P < 0. 001) and decreased urine concentration (P < 0. 05) at slaughter indicating an improved hydration status at slaughter.

40|$|A {{diagnostic}} {{survey was}} carried out to assess the available feed resources in Welayta Awraja (district) around Sodo area. The quantity of different feed resources available in the Awraja was estimated, based on crop produciton and land use information. Chemical composition and in vitro DM digestibility of some feed resources were also determined. Shortage of grazing land and inadequate feed supply was the major constraints of livestock production in the area. The size of land holding per house-hold was 0. 96 ha. About 23 {{percent of the total}} holding, 0. 23 ha, was used for grazing. Feed resources available to the farmers were dominated by poor quality natural pastures and crop residues. The total quantity of animal feed supply from natural <b>pastures,</b> <b>stubble</b> grazing and fallow land grazing were estimated at 345, 27 and 17 thousand tones of DM, respectively. In 1982 / 83 production year crop residues contributed 166 thousand tones of DM. Forest, woodland, bushland and shrubland contribute 87, 000 tones of DM per year. The available feed supply, on a year round basis, satisfies only 78 percent of the maintenance DM requirement of the livestock population of the Awraja. Available evidence also suggests protein deficiency and marginal supply of energy at this level of DM supply. However, the farmers have the tradition of supplementing their animals with leaves and shrubs of various wild and domestic plants, household wastes and left overs. Chemical analyses of the various wild and domestic plants commonly used as supplementary feed by the farmers in Welayta indicated that these plants are potentially useful dry season supplements to crop residue and natural pasture based diets. Thus the growing of forage legumes that are compatible in undersowing or interplanting with food crops and plantation crops, and the production of multipurpose fodder trees as a fence line around the homestead and on crop margins, is a readily acceptable approach of fodder production in Welayta Sodo. The more promising wild plants should be further investigated for their voluntary intake and digestibility by animals, content of anti-nutritional factors, biomass production and ease of propagation...|$|R
40|$|Dry senesced {{pastures}} available {{during the}} summer and autumn period in Western Australia and other areas with a Mediterranean climate are low in vitamin E. The use of expensive and labour-intensive supplements to prevent nutritional myopathy induced by vitamin E deficiency in weaner sheep is common. Low vitamin E concentrations in the muscle preslaughter can also reduce the shelf life of meat. There is growing interest in incorporating saltbush into farming systems in Western Australia. The potential for saltbush to boost the vitamin E status of sheep and improve the shelf life of meat was investigated. Fifty (2 × 25) 18 -month-old Merino hogget wethers (average liveweight 48 kg) were grazed on either a saltbush-dominant saline pasture or on a ‘control’ dry <b>pasture,</b> <b>stubble</b> plot for 14 weeks. At the start of the experiment, all animals were orally supplemented with 2500 IU of dl-α-tocopherol acetate in 6. 25 mL solution. The α-tocopherol content in saltbush was 139 and 116 mg/kg dry matter for old man and river saltbush, respectively. Concentrations of α-tocopherol were measured in plasma at Weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12 and in muscle and liver samples taken at slaughter. Grazing on saltbush significantly elevated α-tocopherol concentrations in the liver and muscle compared with grazing on dry pasture, well above the threshold for vitamin E inadequacy (P < 0. 001). Plasma α-tocopherol concentrations in sheep fed saltbush increased up to Week 8 and then decreased {{until the end of the}} experiment as availability of saltbush declined (P < 0. 05). Plasma α-tocopherol in sheep fed dry pasture increased in the first 4 weeks due to the initial vitamin E treatment but declined thereafter, indicating that the pasture was low in vitamin E. The high muscle concentrations of α-tocopherol in sheep fed saltbush also improved colour stability and may have had an influence on drip and cooking loss. The meat from the saltbush-grazed sheep was moister but drip and cooking loss was the same as from the drier meat of the control sheep. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that saltbush is a potential vitamin E source for sheep...|$|R
40|$|Vitamin E {{concentrations}} in dried <b>pastures,</b> <b>stubble</b> and most grains are below the recommended requirement of 10 - 25 mg/kg dry matter (DM). Sheep grazing {{in an environment}} when dry pastures and cereal crop stubbles are their primary source of nutrients {{for a few months}} have a high risk of developing vitamin E deficiency. If the low vitamin E status coincides with late gestation, the neonate is likely to have a deficiency of vitamin E. Some of the consequences of this are well known, with nutritional myopathy (with high mortality) a risk in young growing sheep unless vitamin E supplements are provided. Vitamin E {{plays an important role in}} the management of oxidative stress. Sperm are subject to oxidative damage due to high metabolic rate and high concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids in their membranes. Oxidative stress may also compromise follicular development and ovarian activity. Vitamin E is also involved with improvement in immune response. For these reasons, vitamin E status is important for reproductive efficiency in both males and females and in the survival of lambs and weaners. In addition, vitamin E deficiency is potentially exacerbated by a lack of other nutrients involved in the management of oxidative stress and immune function, such as selenium (Se) and sulfur amino acids. A Se concentration of 0. 1 mg/kg DM in feedstuffs is required to maintain immune competency in sheep. In considering possible consequences for reproduction, further investigation is justified into: (i) effects of low vitamin E, in combination with low levels of other natural antioxidants, on the quality and quantity of sperm produced before and during mating; (ii) follicle development, fertilisation and embryonic mortality in Se-supplemented ewes; (iii) assessment of supplementing formulated antioxidants to rams and ewes during the mating season; (iv) managing oxidative stress in the newborn - consequences of large doses of vitamin E to ewes before parturition to boost lamb reserves; (v) potential benefits to lamb survival through boosting maternal innate immunity; (vi) choices for boosting antioxidant and immune function in ewes and lambs through 'immune pack' nutrient options that may target nutrients lacking in dry grass pastures; (vii) the potential role of heat stress in modifying the requirements for, and responses to, vitamin E in extensive grazing systems...|$|R
40|$|Availability {{of major}} feed resources, cattle {{fattening}} practices and marketing system were studied to generate baseline information {{which can be}} used for future interventions to develop market oriented cattle fattening program within the integrated mixed crop-livestock system. The study was conducted using cross-sectional survey by interviewing a total of 153 cattle fattener households proportionally selected from four kebeles in Weina-Dega and two kebeles in Sub- Kolla agro-ecologies of Bure Woreda in Amhara National Regional State, Ethiopia. Moreover, focus group discussions, field observations, market monitoring and heart girth measurement have been done to enrich the data. Data analyses were carried out using SAS, JMP 5 statistical software. The study showed that the major feed resources available to livestock include cropresidue, <b>stubble</b> grazing, natural <b>pasture</b> and hay which varied with seasons. Mean annual total utilizable feed supply per household was 12. 70 TDM. Of which, 10. 77 TDM (about 84. 81 %) was derived from cropping system which comprised 9. 63 TDM crop-residues and 1. 14 TDM stubble grazing. Total utilizable DM production from cropping system per household significantly varied (P< 0. 05) between the two agro-ecologies that accounted for 8. 05 ± 0. 59 TDM and 16. 36 ± 0. 84 TDM in Weina-Dega and Sub-Kolla agro-ecologies, respectively. Among crop-residues, maize stover accounted for 64. 58 % and was followed by wheat, teff, and millet with 16. 82 %, 6. 92 %, and 4. 30 % of the total TDM produced from cropping system including the respective stubble grazing. The study showed that average livestock population per household overall in the study area was 5. 31 TLU and the annual maintenance DM requirement was estimated to be 12. 12 TDM. Hence, the existing feed supply can satisfy about 104. 79 % of the maintenance DM requirement of livestock per household. However, the annual feed supply greatly varied between the two agroecologies that accounted for about 90. 84 % and 119. 26 % of the maintenance DM requirement of livestock in Weina-Dega and Sub-Kolla averages, respectively. As a result, feed scarcity was observed in Weina-Dega agro-ecology especially in Arbisi and Woynma-ambaye kebeles, and followed by Wndgi kebele. This study also showed that older plowed oxen about 10 years old have been fattened under farmer’s management with mean live-weight change of about 66. 24 kg per fattened cattle overall in the study area. However, mean live-weight changes were 53. 91 kg and 91. 64 kg for Weina-Dega and Sub-Kolla agro-ecologies, respectively. Household survey indicated that, average price of cattle before and after fattening was about 965 and 1505 birr, respectively, which resulted gross profit of about 540 birr per fattening cattle that came from price margin and feed margin over 110 days of feeding length. Both mean live-weight change and gross profit per fattened cattle in Sub-Kolla kebeles were significantly higher (P< 0. 05) than in Weina-Dega kebeles. Major constraints that hindered the performance of cattle fattening activity were feed shortage, lack of capital, shortage of labour, and animal health problem in order of importance. However, availability of crop-residues, high irrigation potential, better meat type cattle, and high market demand were also identified as good opportunities which could be used to enhance the performance of cattle fattening activity. It can be concluded that cattle fattening could be one potential strategy to improve the income of the farming community that utilizes seasonally available feed resources by improving utilization efficiency through training and extension advice with the help of agricultural development organizations. Moreover, detail research work on DM production, nutrient composition and digestibility of the major available feed resources are recommended for further work.

40|$|A 3 x 2 {{factorial}} experiment {{was conducted to}} examine the outcome {{and some of the}} competitive mechanisms between P. radiata (D. Don) and pasture for N and soil moisture. The factors examined were the monthly addition of 30 kg N/ha versus no additional N, and the manipulation of the level of pasture competition by spraying and simulated-grazing to give three levels of pasture competition. The experiment coincided with a period of severe drought which greatly increased the competition for soil moisture. Removal of pasture competition by spraying released a large amount of N into the soil mineral N pool. It also reduced overall demand for N and water because of the reduction in competition resulting in improved tree growth and greater N uptake by trees. However, it was apparent that moisture was the main limiting factor for tree growth in the plus-pasture treatments because, whilst trees did take up some of the applied N in the plus-pasture treatments, they showed no increase in growth and N uptake. A localized effect of trees on pasture dry matter production and N content occurred. Directly beneath trees and in the area predominantly occupied by tree roots competition for water and N was intense. Pasture response to N was greatest away from the tree rooting zone. Pasture appeared to compete successfully {{due to the nature of}} its root system which consists of a large biomass of very fine roots compared to the small biomass of fine pine roots in the surface soil. Competition between pasture and trees was further examined using the stable isotope 15 N to trace a single 15 N-labelled application of N fertilizer in spring. Recovery of 15 N during the split fertilizer application program was assessed by periodic pasture harvests in the simulated-grazing treatment and by obtaining a complete balance sheet after 249 days. The dynamics of plant availability of applied 15 N and retention of 15 N in the soil was also followed. The recovery and retention of 15 NO 3 - and 15 NH 4 + in particular were compared in the simulated-grazing treatment. Larger quantities of 15 NO 3 - remained available to plants than 15 NH 4 + and 15 N was still found in the KCl-extractable mineral N pool at 154 and 249 days after application. P. Radiate assimilated the same amount of 15 N when added as 15 NO 3 - or 15 NH 4 + in the simulated-grazing treatment but uptake into the aboveground biomass of pasture was greater for 15 NO 3 - than for 15 NH 4 +. However, pasture uptake of 15 NO 3 - and 15 NH 4 + was not significantly different when <b>pasture</b> <b>stubble</b> and roots were include in the total recovery for all harvests. Removal of pasture competition increased the availability of 15 N for the period just after application but 15 N uptake by P. radiata was only doubled. There were no significant differences in 15 N recovery between treatments in the 0 - 20 cm depth of soil; on average this was 49 % of that applied. Total system recovery was 107, 92, 76, and 71 % for the 15 NO 3 -treated, 15 NH 4 + -treated simulated-grazing treatments, 15 NH 4 + -treated rank, and sprayed treatments, respectively. The loss of 15 N from the system was not accounted for by leaching although this was not directly measured. In the sprayed treatment where the loss of 15 N was greatest, it was thought that 15 N loss may have been due to denitrification. The root systems of neighbouring trees did not overlap and midway between the trees there was apparently no competition between trees and pasture since no effect of tree roots on pasture growth and 15 N uptake could be shown. Uptake by artificially-grazed pasture did not seem to reduce 15 N movement into the canopy to the same extent as uptake by rank pasture. In the simulated-grazing treatment the increased cycling of N or reduced pasture root growth may have provided some benefit to tree uptake of 15 N...|$|R
