5|$|On 3 December 1938, 11 {{years after}} they had first met, Julia married Alf after proposing to him. They were married in the Bolton Street Register Office, and Julia wrote 'cinema usherette' on the {{marriage}} certificate as her occupation, even though <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> one. None of Julia's family were there, but Alf's brother Sydney acted as a witness. They spent their honeymoon eating at 'Reece's' restaurant in Clayton Square (which is where his son would later celebrate after his marriage to Cynthia Powell), {{and then went to}} a cinema. On their wedding night, Julia stayed at the Stanleys' house and {{he went back to his}} rooming house.|$|E
25|$|Kayla, {{a killer}} whale born in captivity, {{gave birth to}} her first calf on October 9, 2005, a female named Halyn. Kayla {{rejected}} her calf, perhaps because <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> exposed to a young calf before and {{did not know how to}} deal with it. Halyn was moved to a special animal care facility to be hand raised. Halyn died unexpectedly on June 15, 2008.|$|E

25|$|With Isaac in London, Mary Ann began setting about {{securing}} a financial claim to his assets by filing documents detailing his infidelities, claiming that, though <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> formally married to Isaac, they were wed under Common Law by living together {{for seven months}} after Isaac had been divorced from his first wife Catherine. Eventually a settlement was made, but no divorce was granted. However, she asserted that she was free to marry, and indeed married John E. Foster.|$|E
25|$|In 1947, Columbia Pictures offered Hellman a multi-year {{contract}}, {{which she}} refused because the contract included a loyalty clause that she {{viewed as an}} infringement on her rights of free speech and association. It required her to sign a statement that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> {{a member of the}} Communist Party and would not associate with radicals or subversives, which would have required her to end her life with Hammett. Shortly thereafter, William Wyler told her he was unable to hire her to work on a film because she was blacklisted.|$|E
25|$|Davis and Merrill {{adopted a}} baby boy, Michael (born January 5, 1952), in 1952, and Davis {{appeared}} in a Broadway revue, Two's Company directed by Jules Dassin. She was uncomfortable working outside of her area of expertise; <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> a musical performer and her limited theater experience {{had been more than}} 20years earlier. She was also severely ill and was operated on for osteomyelitis of the jaw. Margot was diagnosed as severely brain-damaged due to an injury sustained during or shortly after her birth, and was placed in an institution around the age of 3. Davis and Merrill began arguing frequently, with B.D. later recalling episodes of alcohol abuse and domestic violence.|$|E

25|$|King Charles was {{executed}} by Parliament in 1649; his death left Henrietta Maria almost destitute and in shock, a situation not {{helped by the}} French civil war of the Fronde, which left Henrietta Maria's nephew King Louis XIV short of money himself. Henrietta Maria also {{was no longer the}} Queen but the Queen Mother to the young King Charles II. During the ensuing, and final, Third English Civil War the whole of the Royalist circle now based itself from St-Germain, with the Queen Mother's followers being joined by the old Royalist circle who had been with Charles II at the Hague, including Ormonde and Inchiquin and Clarendon, whom she particularly disliked. She also quarrelled with Ormonde: when she said that if she had been trusted the King would be in England, Ormonde, with his usual bluntness, retorted that if <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> trusted the King need never have left England. Co-location began to bring the factions together, but Henrietta Maria's influence was waning. In 1654, Charles II moved his court on to Cologne, eliminating the remaining influence of the Queen Mother in St-Germain.|$|E

500|$|On 21 December 1801, when Fanny was seven, Godwin married Mary Jane Clairmont, a {{neighbour}} {{with two}} children of her own: three-year-old Claire and six-year-old Charles. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> married and was looking, like Godwin, for financial stability. Although Clairmont was well-educated and well-travelled, most of Godwin's friends despised her, finding her vulgar and dishonest. They were astonished that Godwin could replace Mary Wollstonecraft with her. [...] Fanny and her half-sister Mary disliked their stepmother and complained that she preferred her own children to them. On 28 March 1803, baby William was born to the couple.|$|E

500|$|Some critics {{highlighted}} Stowe's {{paucity of}} life-experience relating to Southern life, {{saying that it}} led her to create inaccurate descriptions of the region. For instance, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> to a Southern plantation. However, Stowe always said she based the characters of her book on stories she was told by runaway slaves in Cincinnati. It is reported that [...] "She observed firsthand several incidents which galvanized her to write [...] famous anti-slavery novel. Scenes she observed on the Ohio River, including seeing {{a husband and wife}} being sold apart, as well as newspaper and magazine accounts and interviews, contributed material to the emerging plot." ...|$|E
500|$|Jamila M'Barek {{told the}} court {{that she was not}} with her brother when he {{disposed}} of the body, and in fact, she stated that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> to the site. She claimed that she had no role in the killing other than helping her brother, under duress, load the body into his car. She told investigators, [...] "I did not want him to die. I just wanted my brother to intimidate him so that he would continue to pay me my allowance. But he didn't {{want to have anything to}} do with it, so a violent quarrel broke out. I left the room because I could not stand to see what was happening".|$|E
500|$|She {{continued}} to hold the University of Chicago Hospitals position during the primary campaign, but cut back to part-time in order {{to spend time with}} her daughters as well as work for her husband's election; she subsequently took a leave of absence from her job. According to the couple's 2006 income tax return, her salary was $273,618 from the University of Chicago Hospitals, while her husband had a salary of $157,082 from the United States Senate. The Obamas' total income, however, was $991,296, which included $51,200 she earned {{as a member of the}} board of directors of TreeHouse Foods, and investments and royalties from his books.

500|$|Kodnani {{said that}} <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> to Naroda {{and had become}} a [...] "victim of politics". Judge Yagnik {{described}} her as the [...] "kingpin of the violence", and as the 37 months of trials ended, the court {{said in a statement}} that Kodnani had received help from the state government, and efforts had been made to avoid her name appearing on the list of accused. The statement said, [...] "Kodnani was tremendously favoured by the then investigating agencies (before the Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team took over). All care, at the cost of the duty of the investigating officer and even the interest of the victims, was taken to see to it that Kodnani's involvement does not come on the books. This, in fact, comes in the way to believe that Kodnani was ever a victim of any politics." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode's opening musical number, [...] "Red Solo Cup", {{was given}} a mixed {{reception}} by reviewers. Chaney called it a [...] "fun change of pace", though she wasn't fond of Toby Keith, who originated the song; Bell admitted <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> [...] "much of a Sam fan", but she thought Sam's version [...] "was pretty great". Canning called the song a [...] "terrible choice", and Ford wrote that it [...] "fell unbelievably short". Futterman credited a [...] "surprisingly natural country twang from Sam", but added that the [...] "choir room performance feels mostly stale". Votta could find no sense in its inclusion, and called it the [...] "weirdest song on [...] "Glee" [...] since 'Run Joey Run, while Hankinson was harsher, and declared it to be his [...] "least favorite Glee performance of all time". West, on the other hand, said the song was [...] "perfect for Sam", and Overstreet's [...] "smooth sultry voice nailed it".|$|E
500|$|On 3 December 1938, 11 {{years after}} they had first met, she married Alf Lennon after she had {{proposed}} to him. They were married in the Bolton Street Registry office, although none of her family were present as she had not informed them of the wedding. She wrote 'cinema usherette' as her occupation on the marriage certificate, even though <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> one. They spent their honeymoon eating at Reece's restaurant in Clayton Square (which is where their son would later celebrate after his marriage to Cynthia Powell), {{and then went to}} a cinema. She walked into 9Newcastle Road waving the marriage licence and said to her family, [...] "There!—I've married him." [...] It was an act of defiance against her father, who had threatened to disown her if she ever cohabitated with a lover. On their wedding night, she stayed at her parents' house, and Lennon went back to his boarding house. The next day, he went back to sea for three months, on a ship bound for the West Indies.|$|E

500|$|On February 18, 1995, Madonna {{arrived in}} Europe to promote Bedtime Stories. During the same day, she {{performed}} [...] "Secret" [...] and [...] "Take a Bow" [...] on German TV show Wetten, dass..?, {{while she was}} also interviewed on the program. Madonna went back to United States and performed [...] "Take a Bow" [...] on the American Music Awards of 1995, accompanied by Babyface and a full orchestra. Babyface said the performance was terrifying for him: [...] "I was nervous as hell. But you couldn't actually see my legs shaking under the suit. When we finished, she told me <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> that nervous before. That was crazy to me -- I was thinking, 'You're Madonna, you're on stage all the time!'". She returned to Europe and sang the song Sanremo Music Festival. At {{the end of the}} performance, she thanked the audience in Italian language, and received standing ovation. Madonna did rehearse the song for 2004's Re-Invention World Tour, but it was ultimately cut from the setlist and not included in the show.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Hidden Place" [...] was {{directed}} by Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin and co-directed by M/M (Paris). It was shot in London over four days in February 2001. It was originally planned for a song from Selmasongs, but Björk felt the project was more appropriate for Vespertine. The video consists of close-up shots panning around Björk's face, as fluids flow {{in and out of}} her facial orifices. M/M (Paris) explained the concept behind the video:We always wanted to get as close to her as we could, as we all felt <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> portrayed as the [...] "real" [...] and beautiful woman she is. This is somehow taboo, to observe a pop star with no makeup from a distance of half an inch. Then the idea of the liquid works as a visualization of all possible emotions pulsating and circulating in her very busy brain. The loop idea was a main point for us as well, trying to extend the usual time frame of pop video super-fast editing, to make it hypnotising, mesmerising and irritating, like an eternally burning fireplace.|$|E
500|$|Following his death, the Nazis and Communists offered {{different}} {{accounts of}} the events. The police [...] led by Chief Inspector Teichmann [...] and several courts determined that both political and private reasons had led to Wessel's assassination. By 17 January 1930, the police had announced that their prime suspect was KPD member Albrecht [...] "Ali" [...] Höhler, a heavily-tattoed cabinetmaker, pimp and procuror, just recently released from prison, whom Jänicke had identified as the gunman. It was then reported by a non-Nazi and non-Communist newspaper that Jänicke knew Höhler prior to the murder because Wessel had used her to spy on her former clients who were Communists. The Communists, in turn, claimed that Höhler had been Jänicke's pimp until Wessel stole her from him, {{and that this was}} the motive behind the shooting. [...] Jänicke denied these stories, saying that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> a spy for Wessel, and that she only knew Höhler as an [...] "acquaintance from the streets". The police and courts believed Jänicke, and Höhler was quickly arrested. After a trial, he was sentenced to six years imprisonment for the shooting; the light sentence {{was the result of the}} court finding that there were extenuating circumstances. Seven accomplices were also found guilty and sentenced to jail.|$|E
