However, BOK has switched to reporting the I–O table only at basic prices following the table for 2010. Hence, it is necessary to convert the I–O table valued at the basic prices to that valued at producers’ prices. The accounts that need to be addressed are: Taxes less <b>subsidies</b> <b>on</b> <b>products,</b> Scraps, and Tariffs. In the case of the table valued at producers’ price, the Taxes less <b>subsidies</b> <b>on</b> <b>products</b> are included in the Intermediate demand and the Final demand.

The Chair is now trying to come up with a revised text which builds on common ground. The EU for its part remains in 'reflection mode', preferring to listen rather than take a lead, and the Commission has remained conspicuously silent in Geneva.

40|$|Chapter 1 : Downstream Competition and the Effects of Buyer Power The {{first chapter}} {{examines}} {{the interaction between}} buyer power and competition intensity in the downstream market in affecting consumer and total welfare. We study a model where oligopolistic retailers compete in quantity in the downstream market {{and one of them}} is a large retailer that has its own exclusive supplier. Negotiation between this retailer and its supplier is modeled as a generalized Nash bargaining game. We demonstrate that an increase in the buyer power of the large retailer against its supplier leads to a fall in retail price and consequently an improvement in consumer surplus and this is true even in the extreme case where the downstream market is served by a monopoly. More interestingly, we find that the effects of buyer power are large when the intensity of downstream competition is low, with the effects being the largest in the case of downstream monopoly. This suggests that buyer power and downstream competition are substitutes. Chapter 2 : Subsidy, Product Diversity and Buyer Power The objective of the second chapter is to analyze the effectiveness of government subsidies in promoting product diversity when the downstream firm (a retailer) has buyer power. We extend the standard Dixit-Stiglitz model of monopolistic competition and compare the effects of <b>subsidies</b> <b>on</b> equilibrium number of product varieties and social welfare in the case where products are sold directly to consumers and the case where they are sold through a monopoly retailer with buyer power. Two types of subsidies are considered, a <b>subsidy</b> <b>on</b> marginal cost and a <b>subsidy</b> <b>on</b> fixed cost. We find that while the two types of subsides have different effects on the quantity and retail price of each variety, they both raise the number of product varieties and the social welfare. Moreover, a combination of the two types of subsidies is able to achieve the social optimum. These results are true even when products are distributed through a downstream monopoly retailer who has all the bargaining power, but the mechanism through which a subsidy increases product varieties is different. In comparison with the case where products are distributed directly to consumers, retailer buyer power reduces product variety and social welfare. Furthermore subsidies become less effective in the presence of buyer power. To be more specific, retailer buyer power has both a level effect and a marginal effect <b>on</b> <b>product</b> diversity. At any given subsidy rate, the equilibrium number of varieties is smaller and a marginal increase in subsidy leads to a smaller increase in the number of varieties. Chapter 3 : <b>Subsidy</b> <b>on</b> Complementary <b>Products</b> in a Model of Monopolistic Competition The third chapter seeks to re-examine the market provision of product diversity under monopolistic competition and the effects of an infinitesimal <b>subsidy</b> <b>on</b> <b>product</b> variety and social welfare in the case of complementary products. This examination builds on the standard Dixit-Stiglitz model of monopolistic competition but assumes an alternative demand linkage. The results show that, different from the case of substitutable products, demand complementarity leads to multiple equilibriums and the number of product varieties could be higher or lower than the constrained optimum depending on the level of the fixed cost of production. When the fixed costs are small, the market yields too many products and an infinitesimal subsidy exacerbates the problem leading to an over-supply of <b>product</b> varieties. <b>On</b> the other hand, when the fixed costs are large, there are too few products and in some cases the complementary goods industry becomes non-existent.

One strand deals with microeconomic models which investigate incentives to adopt and to develop environmentally more friendly technologies for different policy tools and in different economic environments, such as market structure or timing and commitment structures. It turns out that, firstly, price based instruments such as emission taxes and tradable permits perform better than command and control policies, and secondly, that under competitive conditions ex ante end ex post optimal policies are equivalent. Under imperfect market conditions the policy conclusions are more subtile. The second strand of literature deals with both pollution-reducing and resource-saving technological progress within endogenous growth models. Most of these models are characterized by three market imperfections : market power for new (intermediate) products, positive R&D spillovers, and pollution.

Four different instruments were selected for evaluation: pesticide taxes, price penalties on pesticides’ environmental spillovers, subsidies, and quotas. The results of the study indicate that even high taxes and penalties would result in a small decrease in pesticide use and environmental spillovers. Taxes that differentiate according to toxicity do not lead to substitution of high- with low-toxicity pesticides. <b>Subsidies</b> <b>on</b> low-toxicity <b>products</b> are not able to affect the use of high-toxicity products.

However, many developed countries continue to impose high trade barriers on their sensitive agricultural products, and the financial support for agriculture has continually increased, although they have changed the support measures. In this paper, we first review the process and details of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reforms—from the Makuhari reform to the Mid-Term Review(MTR) reform in the EU. Then, we analyze the real changes in the market conditions and the political environment surrounding the EU farms, as well as changes in agricultural inputs, production, and the trade of agricultural products in the former 15 EU countries.

This paper presents the performance of agricultural exports for selected countries and indicates external market barriers faced and the resulting implications of the barriers on WTO Doha Development Agenda (DDA) negotiations. The composition of agricultural exports and markets shows that exports from Sub Saharan Africa are less diversified with only five commodities mainly coffee, cocoa, cotton, hides and skins, and horticultural crops dominating in most countries. Markets are also concentrated on only a few countries with the European Union being a major market although intra Africa trade has increased in recent years because of regional integration efforts. Important external market access barriers faced are tariff peaks and escalation particularly for agro-processed and livestock products in developed countries and non tariff barriers particularly sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) and technical barriers to trade (TBTs) measures, safeguard and anti-dumping measures, and domestic and export <b>subsidies</b> <b>on</b> agricultural <b>products</b> for developed countries.

In light of these linkages, this paper empirically examines the transmission of key monetary policy variables to domestic food prices and the resulting welfare impacts. Estimates of policy-induced price changes from estimated cointegrating relations between commodity prices and policy variables as well as demand elasticities from estimated quadratic almost ideal demand system (QUAIDS) of households’ consumption expenditures, were employed to estimate the welfare impact (compensating variation) of the policy-induced price changes. The study found that government management of exchange rates and money supplies as well as withdrawal of <b>subsidies</b> <b>on</b> petroleum <b>products</b> have been the main driver of rising food prices in the country. While the average farm household benefited from these price increases, with the mean (median) compensating variation estimated - 7. 8 % (- 0. 2 %) of the household budget, a sizeable proportion (44. 1 – 55. 5 %) of the households suffered welfare losses from various policy induced price changes.

Few researches are found <b>on</b> <b>product</b> basis especially in the scenario of Pakistan. This research will provide an overview of the exports of 13 different products from Pakistan.

Thirdly, information on price elasticities of a number of foods (crisps, soft drinks, meat, fruit, vegetables) also suggested that their purchase is only moderately influenced by their own price. Price elasticities were both drawn from the literature and calculated from data on purchases by 4400 Dutch households.
