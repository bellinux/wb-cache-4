30|$|<b>Sintering</b> <b>plants</b> can release {{high levels}} of PCDD/F and other UPOPs. Before the {{introduction}} of regulatory limits [e.g., 0.4  ng TEQ/Nm 3, with a target value 0.1  ng TEQ/Nm 3 in Germany (according to TA Luft 2002)], the <b>sintering</b> <b>plants</b> had high emissions, up to 100  g TEQ/a for individual facilities [125]. Such high (historic) releases can have resulted in elevated PCDD/F levels in the surrounding soil. The PCDD/F levels in soil within a radius of 5  km from an Italian <b>sinter</b> <b>plant</b> averaged 3.1  ng TEQ/kg dm, with a maximum concentration of 10.3  ng TEQ/kg dm; dl-PCB levels {{were in the same}} range [91]. The PCDD/F and PCB contamination from this <b>sinter</b> <b>plant</b> resulted in sheep (meat and liver) exceeding the EU maximum limits and in the destruction of 1600 cattle (see also Sect. 2.4. 4) [90, 91, Esposito et al. 2014].

50|$|It was {{not until}} 1937, {{with the threat of}} war in Europe and the {{emergence}} of a profitable market for Canadian iron ore, that the Helen Mine was reopened. A <b>sintering</b> <b>plant</b> was constructed on the northern bank of the Magpie River, two miles west of the mine.

The plant was built in 1924 by the Hanna Mining Company to process iron ore mined in the Cuyuna Range. The mining industry, after 1900, was seeking to exploit lower-grade iron deposits to meet the increasing demand of the iron and steel industry.

The sintering process was unique to the Cuyuna Range and made it possible to economically support mining.|$|E

50|$|By 1900, TCI was {{operating}} 15 iron ore mines in the Birmingham District including the Wenonah #7, and #8 mining camps. In 1880, before TCI became the owner, the #7 mine was operated by T.T.

The Wenonah #8 mine, opened in 1887, was originally the Fossil Mine and was operated by the Smith Mining Company. Wenonah Mining Camp #7, later in 1940, became the site of the <b>sintering</b> <b>plant</b> that processed the iron ore before being transported via The High Line Railroad connection from Red Mountain to the Fairfield Works.

40|$|A {{remarkable}} {{example of}} point-source lake acidification and metal pollution, and subsequent recovery in limnological variables, {{has occurred in}} lakes near the former iron <b>sintering</b> <b>plant</b> at Wawa (Ontario, Canada). Surface water pH levels {{in some of these}} lakes have increased from 3 to 7 following local sulphur emission reductions with closure of industrial operations. Previous paleolimnological work documented striking successional changes in diatom species assemblages within dated sediment cores that could be related to past industrial activities. To gain additional insights into the chemical and biological recovery trajectories of the Wawa lakes, we used paleolimnological techniques to track euplanktonic scaled-chrysophyte (classes Chrysophyceae and Synurophyceae) species assemblage responses to historical water quality changes in five lakes. Coincident with the period of iron sintering from 1939 to 1998, striking successional changes were noted in the sedimentary profiles, with marked increases in the relative abundances of the acid- and metal-tolerant taxon Synura echinulata. The scaled chrysophyte changes pre-dated diatom responses, confirming the former’s status as reliable early warning indicators of lake acidification. Following closure of the <b>sintering</b> <b>plant,</b> species-specific chrysophyte responses to decreased emissions varied amongst the study lakes, perhaps reflecting differences in local bedrock geology and hydrological regime. Although some water chemistry variables may have recovered to near pre-industrial levels, similar to the diatom study, our data show that chrysophyte assemblages in the most recent sediments are now significantly different from pre-industrial assemblages...|$|E

40|$|The {{process of}} {{sintering}} {{is characterized by}} the circulation load - the return, which is both a production intensifier and a production fault. The return mode influences upon productivity of a <b>sintering</b> <b>plant</b> {{and the quality of the}} sinter. In production conditions the output of the return is self-balanced because of the product’s strength and the way of sinter cake processing. So it is required to try to reach balanced return in order to get objective results in laboratory conditions. Various factors of the sintering process productivity determined from wet charge, from charge with return, from finished sinter cake from standard stabilized sinter cake under closed cycle of return were analyzed in this article. In laboratory conditions a comparative evaluation of the sintering process productivity by raw charge and finished sinter cake output under a closed balanced cycle of return is most objective. Evaluation of productivity without any regard to the amount of the return in charge materials leads to biased results of investigations. A stabilized balance of return is supposed to take place under production conditions. The existing method of a <b>sintering</b> <b>plant</b> productivity evaluation is based on the shipped finished sinter cake output, without consideration for the quantity of the fine fraction, removed before charging into blast furnaces (secondary return), which is also added into sinter charge. Hence, a comparative evaluation of specific productivity of the sintering process must be made with due regard of the aggregate output of return or the strength of the sinter cake. Evaluation of specific productivity by stabilized sinter cake makes it possible to predict the output of finished sinter cake of high strength. An intensifying action upon the sintering process also depends upon the size of the return. In further investigations it is necessary to analyze the possibilities of controlling the return mode by means of preliminary granulation of its small fraction...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper treats {{modeling}} and {{control for the}} burnthrough point in industrial sintering processes. First, a simple state-space model for event-time dynamics is derived for a complicated system by introducing events into a continuous variable system. For {{the control of the}} sintering process, a twostage control policy is used. First, optimal interevent time is obtained from an output-constrained receding horizon control with a least-square prediction algorithm. Then the average strand speeds for the interevent times are obtained and applied as a command signal to a motor control system. It is proved that the proposed output-constrained receding horizon control law with a short horizon stabilizes the closed-loop system and the steady-state error for a set-point becomes zero. The real-time experiments are carried out in a POSCO (Pohang Steel Company, Korea) <b>sintering</b> <b>plant</b> and satisfactory results are presented in this paper. Also, computer simulations are carried out and compared with the real-time experiments.
