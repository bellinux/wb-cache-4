5|$|The {{security}} services took Biko to the Walmer police station in Port Elizabeth, {{where he was}} held naked in a cell with his legs in <b>shackles.</b> On 6 September, he was transferred from Walmer to room 619 of the security police headquarters in the Sanlam Building in central Port Elizabeth, where he was interrogated for 22 hours, handcuffed and in <b>shackles,</b> and chained to a grille. Exactly what happened has never been ascertained, but during the interrogation he was severely beaten {{by at least one}} of the ten security police officers. He suffered three brain lesions that resulted in a massive brain haemorrhage on 6 September. Following this incident, Biko's captors forced him to remain standing and shackled to the wall. The police later said that Biko had attacked one of them with a chair, forcing them to subdue him and place him in handcuffs and leg irons.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{research}} was to analyze {{the effect of a}} short audiovisual training on the <b>shackled</b> technique efficiency in three different stress situations. Technical <b>shackle</b> techniques procedures in 3 different situations of 26 male soldiers were analyzed after an audiovisual session. The situations were normal, alert and danger. <b>Shackle</b> maneuver was divided in approach to the subject, subject control, placing the first <b>shackle,</b> limb immobilization, placing the second <b>shackle,</b> frisk and transfer actions. The audiovisual training was composed by a video of <b>shackled</b> technique in normal, alert and danger situation that soldiers could watch a maximum of three time previous to the realization of the evaluation test. A decrease on <b>shackled</b> maneuver efficiency was measured with the stress. Limb immobilization presented the lowest values in alert and danger situations, a fact that has to be improved. <b>Shackled</b> maneuver time was twice in danger than in normal and alert situations, fact related to the stress of the situations.

5|$|A second woodcut was {{executed}} by Hans Burgkmair in Augsburg {{around the same}} time as Dürer's in Nuremberg. Burgkmair corresponded with merchants in Lisbon and Nuremberg, {{but it is not clear}} whether he had access to a letter or sketch as Dürer did, perhaps even Dürer's sources, or saw the animal himself in Portugal. His image is truer to life, omitting Dürer's more fanciful additions and including the <b>shackles</b> and chain used to restrain the rhinoceros; however, Dürer's woodcut is more powerful and eclipsed Burgkmair's in popularity. Only one impression (example) of Burgkmair's image has survived, whereas Dürer's print survives in many impressions. Dürer produced a first edition of his woodcut in 1515, in the first state, which is distinguished by only five lines of text in the heading. Many further printings followed after Dürer's death in 1528, including two in the 1540s, and two more in the late 16th century. Later printings have six lines of descriptive text.|$|E

40|$|G. L. S <b>Shackle’s</b> {{rejection}} of the probability tradition stemming from Knight's definition of uncertainty was a crucial episode {{in the development of}} modern decision theory. A set of methodological statements characterizing <b>Shackle’s</b> stance, abandoned for long, especially after Savage’s Foundations, have been re-discovered and are at the basis of current non-expected utility theories, in particular of the non-additive probability approach to decision making. This paper examines the discussion between <b>Shackle</b> and his critics in the 1950 s. Drawing on <b>Shackle’s</b> papers housed at Cambridge University Library as well as on printed matter, we show that some critics correctly understood two aspects of <b>Shackle’s</b> theory which are of the utmost importance in our view: the non-additive character of the theory and the possibility of interpreting <b>Shackle’s</b> ascendancy functions as a specific distortion of the weighting function of the decision maker. It is argued that <b>Shackle</b> neither completely understood criticisms nor appropriately developed suggestions put forward by scholars like Kenneth Arrow, Ward Edwards, Nicholas Georgescu- Roegen. Had he succeeded in doing so, we contend, his theory might have been a more satisfactory alternative to Savage’s theory than it actually was. uncertainty, decision theory, non-additive measures...|$|R

The primary tasks of the brigade were {{to bring in}} reinforcements and supplies, and to aid the two parachute brigades in consolidating the area held by the division; the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Squadron was {{to aid in the}} latter task, acting as a reconnaissance force to scout out German positions and impede the movement of German forces attempting to counter-attack. The Tetrarchs of 'A' Squadron were to play an integral part in this reconnaissance role due to their speed, but the squadron's strength of twenty tanks was severely depleted by the time it landed in Normandy. It lost one tank before the formation landed when the Tetrarch broke loose of its <b>shackles</b> and crashed through the nose of the glider that was carrying it, causing both to fall into the sea mid-flight. The squadron's strength was further weakened when two gliders collided with each other in the landing zone, destroying themselves and the Tetrarchs they carried; a third Hamilcar hit another Tetrarch as it was being unloaded and flipped the tank upside down, rendering it unusable, although the crew escaped without injury. The surviving tanks were then rendered temporarily immobile when parachute rigging lines became tangled in their suspensions, forcing their crews to cut the lines away with welding torches.|$|E

5|$|In general, a Vortigaunt is a {{somewhat}} humanoid figure with two legs and two arms, but has an additional arm protruding from its thorax. Vortigaunts have mottled green skin and digitigrade legs, {{allowing them to}} move quickly. Typically, Vortigaunts have a slightly hunched posture. In addition, Vortigaunts have sharp teeth, clawed hands, strong senses, and their faces are dominated by a large red eye. In Half-Life, this eye is surrounded by five smaller eyes, although, in Half-Life 2, this {{has been reduced to}} three smaller eyes. A key aspect of the Vortigaunts is their ability to summon energy to their command without the need for any equipment. In-game, this ability is most commonly used as a means of attack, with Vortigaunts' hurling the energy towards foes in the form of green electrical bolts. In addition, Vortigaunts {{have been shown to be}} able to use the energy for other purposes, such as assisting in repair work, removing rubble and blockages, recharging the player's HEV suit or powering up electrical generators. Enslaved Vortigaunts are depicted with green collars and <b>shackles,</b> although the means by which these control Vortigaunts is not explored. Vortigaunts are not typically seen wearing clothing, although several Vortigaunts are observed wearing lab coats and chef's clothing in the course of Half-Life 2 and its expansions.

40|$|The {{international}} human rights community has repeatedly {{expressed concern about the}} <b>shackling</b> of pregnant women deprived of their liberty in the United States. The federal government has adopted an anti-shackling policy and some states have passed laws or policies restricting <b>shackling.</b> Despite these positive developments, <b>shackling</b> of women prisoners continues to occur in violation of U. S. and international law. <b>Shackling</b> pregnant women increases the substantial medical risks of childbirth. <b>Shackling</b> of pregnant women is a harmful, painful, and demeaning practice that is rarely necessary to preserve safety. Most female prisoners are non-violent offenders, and women who are pregnant, in labor, or in postpartum recovery are especially low flight and safety risks. Both international law and U. S. constitutional law prohibit <b>shackling</b> during certain stages of pregnancy, childbirth, and post-partum recovery. Article 10 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (the "ICCPR") guarantees that persons deprived of their liberty be treated with dignity and respect. Article 7 prohibits torture, or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment. The Eighth Amendment to the U. S. Constitution prohibits cruel or unusual punishments, which some Federal courts have interpreted to prohibit the <b>shackling</b> of pregnant prisoners during childbirth. While the U. S. federal government has adopted an anti-shackling policy that applies to federal prisons and 24 states have adopted policies limiting (to varying degrees) <b>shackling</b> of pregnant prisoners, legislation enacted by state legislatures is preferable to the adoption of an administrative policy by the executive. Indeed, 18 state legislatures in the United States have in fact passed legislation restricting <b>shackling,</b> but many such laws contain broad exceptions or are not adequately implemented. We recommend that the UN Human Rights Committee (the "Committee") that monitors compliance with the ICCPR ask and encourage the United States to 1) enact a federal law banning the practice of <b>shackling</b> prisoners during pregnancy, covering, at a minimum, the third trimester, transport to medical facilities, labor, delivery and postpartum recovery, 2) take appropriate measures to ensure that those 32 states that do not have anti-shackling laws to enact comprehensive laws, including training of correctional officers, 3) to review existing state anti-shackling laws and policies to ensure that they are comprehensive and fully-implemented, and 4) to conduct an empirical study to determine the scope of <b>shackling</b> in U.
