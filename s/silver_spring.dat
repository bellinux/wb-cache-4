50|$|The <b>Silver</b> <b>Springs</b> {{attraction}} {{dates to}} the 1870s. In 1985 the state purchased the land surrounding <b>Silver</b> <b>Springs</b> to spare it from development, creating the Silver River State Park.

These tracks used {{to be part of the}} former Batimore & Ohio Railroad route. MARC uses this parallel route when traveling between Washington and Martinsburg, West Virginia. Amtrak, on the other hand, uses this parallel route when traveling the Capitol Limited route between Washington and Chicago Union Station. Although MARC does stop at the <b>Silver</b> <b>Spring</b> and Rockville stations between Washington and West Virginia, Amtrak only stops at Rockville between Washington and Chicago.|$|E

For the Yellow Line, all trains bound for Fort Totten terminate at Mount Vernon Square. These are primarily instituted due to a limited supply of rail cars and the locations of pocket tracks throughout the system.|$|E

5|$|MD410 was {{originally}} built along mostly new alignment between Bethesda and <b>Silver</b> <b>Spring</b> {{in the late}} 1920s. The highway was extended east to Hyattsville in the mid-1930s. While the Montgomery County portion has not changed much in the ensuing decades, MD 410 has been realigned and extended multiple times within Prince George's County. These changes include an extension along existing roads further into Hyattsville in the mid-1940s, a realignment within Hyattsville in the mid-1950s, an extension through Riverdale in the late 1960s, and the final extension to Landover Hills in the early 1990s.|$|E
5000|$|Florida {{state law}} chapter 4268, {{approved}} June 1, 1893, verified {{the incorporation of}} the Ocala Street and Suburban Railroad Company, since there was some doubt {{as to whether it}} was strictly following the laws relating to the incorporation of railroad companies. At the time, about 3.5 miles of track had been built. The company was given the right [...] "to construct, maintain and operate a line of railroad from the city of Ocala to <b>Silver</b> <b>Springs,</b> in said county, and from <b>Silver</b> <b>Springs</b> to <b>Silver</b> <b>Springs</b> Park, in said county, and through the streets of said towns of <b>Silver</b> <b>Springs</b> and <b>Silver</b> <b>Springs</b> Park, under such restrictions as may be made by law; and to operate the same by horse power, steam, cable, or electricity, as it may deem the most convenient." ...|$|R

50|$|The nearby {{community}} of <b>Silver</b> <b>Springs</b> developed around the <b>Silver</b> <b>Springs,</b> {{a group of}} artesian <b>springs</b> on the <b>Silver</b> River. In the 19th century, this site became Florida's first tourist destination.

5|$|A {{number of}} light rail and urban {{streetcar}} {{projects have been}} proposed to extend or supplement service provided by Metro. Like the Silver Line in Virginia, the proposed Purple Line has been in planning since the 1980s. The project was originally envisioned as a circular heavy rail line connecting the outer stations on each branch of the Metrorail system, in a pattern roughly mirroring the Capital Beltway. The current proposal would create a light rail system in Maryland between the Bethesda and New Carrollton stations by way of <b>Silver</b> <b>Spring</b> and College Park. Such a plan would connect both branches of the Red Line to the Green and Orange Lines, and would decrease the travel time between suburban Metro stations.|$|E
5|$|During {{the debate}} on the bill, New York's Francis B. Cutting demanded that Breckinridge retract or explain a {{statement}} he had made, which Breckinridge understood as a challenge to duel. Under the code duello, the challenged party selected the weapons and the distance between combatants; Breckinridge chose rifles at 60 paces and suggested the duel be held in <b>Silver</b> <b>Spring,</b> Maryland, on his friend, Francis Preston Blair's estate. Cutting had not meant his remark as a challenge, but insisted that he was now challenged and selected pistols at 10 paces. While their representatives tried to clarify matters, Breckinridge and Cutting made amends, averting the duel. Had it taken place, Breckinridge could have been removed from the House; the 1850 Kentucky Constitution prevented duelists from holding office.|$|E
5|$|From Gallery Place â€“ Chinatown through Judiciary Square, {{the line}} runs southeast, turning east again at D Street to reach Union Station. There it turns north and {{surfaces}} adjacent to Union Station's platforms, follows the Washington Terminal yard tracks north to Brentwood {{where the line}} turns northwestward and again joins CSX Transportation's Metropolitan Subdivision tracks, running in a unique gauntlet arrangement with the freight railroad tracks straddling the Metro tracks. The Red Line continues in this manner northwest across the District-Maryland line, through Takoma and past <b>Silver</b> <b>Spring.</b> It reenters a tunnel at 16th Street and heads north under Georgia Avenue to the end at Glenmont. There is a maintenance yard between the NoMa and Rhode Island Avenue stops.|$|E

50|$|The {{river was}} used {{extensively}} in the 19th century and early 20th century for steamboat transportation, most famously the Hart Line operated by Hubbard L. Hart. Narrow steamboats were used to navigate the constrictive and winding river. In the 1870s, the route between Palatka and <b>Silver</b> <b>Springs</b> became very popular, and was travelled by prominent figures such as Harriet Beecher Stowe, Ulysses S. Grant, Thomas A. Edison and Mary Todd Lincoln to visit <b>Silver</b> <b>Springs.</b> The scenic trip up the river added a sense of adventure to a visit to <b>Silver</b> <b>Springs.</b> The popularity of the river route to <b>Silver</b> <b>Springs</b> declined after the arrival of railroad service to Ocala in 1881.|$|R
