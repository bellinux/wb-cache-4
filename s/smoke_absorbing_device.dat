40|$|Many {{office and}} public {{buildings}} today are constructed with so called external curtain walls, i. e., large glass facades. Although such structures are aesthetically pleasing and architecturally attractive, protecting such buildings from conventional bomb attacks poses enormous challenge. A standard curtain wall {{exposed to a}} bomb blast instantly becomes a source of flying debris of sharp shards which are often more deadly than the blast itself. This paper addresses an approach to providing blast resistant window systems in which the window pane is prevented from blowing forcefully into the room upon an external blast thus protecting occupants from risks of being killed or injured by flying sharp debris. The protective systems {{use a combination of}} debris catching systems and strengthening of existing windows to prevent debris from entering the occupied space. The key to optimising the performance of these systems is to use energy <b>absorbing</b> <b>devices</b> that are capable of absorbing displacement of the window pane and converting it into heat or mechanical work. Dynamic non-linear analyses were performed to optimise the parameters of the blast protection systems for glass facades.

40|$|The {{research}} work {{which has been}} reported in this thesis is associated with the design of an energy <b>absorbing</b> <b>device.</b> The device as well as being capable to absorb high amount of energy, possess all the necessary properties of a structural member. Most energy <b>absorbing</b> <b>devices</b> have not the necessary conditions {{to be used as a}} structural members. Their problems have been demonstrated in chapter 1 and chapter 3 of the this thesis. In order to overcome these problems an alternative kind of energy <b>absorbing</b> <b>device,</b> has been proposed. The inversion of tubes has been proposed as the basic of the work. This is a wellknown energy-absorbing principle and has been widely used in industry and many mechanical engineering cases as the basic of design. However, the device has some disadvantages and these required improvement. The following steps have been taken to improve the energy absorbing characteristics: 1 - Normally the energy absorbing capacity of the device is limited due to buckling. This problem has been improved by including an adhesive within the device. 2 - The second problem in this energy-absorbing device is that its elastic stiffness is very low and this is unacceptable for a structural member. The elastic stiffness has been improved by forming a stiff shell at the top of the tube. 3 - The device undergoes a significant change in length during the energy absorbing process and if it is not compensated in some way, the device will be useless in the subsequent cycles of vibration. A special mechanism has been installed in the device to solve this problem. This enables the deformation to be compensated after the absorption process. Two major applications for the device have been considered to be studied in the thesis: First because of its special response at high speed loading, it has been installed in a simply supported framework. The middle member of this framework has been replaced by the energy <b>absorbing</b> <b>device</b> and the behaviour of the framework has been analysed under an explosive load. In order to determine the advantages of the installation of this device in a framework, this framework has also been analysed without the inclusion of the device. The comparison of these results showed that when the framework is equipped with the absorber, a great reduction in the forces and strains of the members of the framework have been achieved. The framework has become 2. 5 times stronger, when just one device was used in the frame. In the second application of the device, its behaviour has been studied as an absorber of a first soft story method. The first soft story is one of the ideas which has been presented for the isolation of buildings from earthquake effects, however, no proper absorber has been suggested to be used in this method. This device has an excellent performance in this regard, because of its shortening ability and its compact form along with its high energy absorbing capacity. Two energy <b>absorbing</b> <b>devices</b> were inserted in the braces of a single degree freedom structure and subjected to a high rate base acceleration. For a comparison, the behaviour of the frame, when it was not equipped with the devices, was also analysed. The results indicated that by the inclusion of the absorber, the acceleration has been decreased more than three times. The forces in the members were also three times less than the frame without the device. Finally, the behaviour of a multi story building has been examined when it was equipped with two energy <b>absorbing</b> <b>device</b> in the braces of the first floor. The results showed that a great reduction in the accelerations, velocities and also the forces and moments has been achieved, as was the case in the previous example. By using this absorber in the braces, the accelerations and velocities were four times less than the case which the frame did not include any absorber. In simple words, this energy absorber is similar to the dampers, which are used in the vehicles to reduce vibrations, but with this difference that the dampers in the car are active all the time while this damper is activated only when a high rate loading is applied...|$|R

40|$|Because {{of their}} high strength-to-weight ratio, Fiber Reinforced Composite (FRC) {{materials}} are well suited for use in high performance racing applications where weight must be kept to a minimum. Formula SAE (FSAE) race cars are designed and built by college students, roughly following the model of a scaled down Formula One car. Strict regulations are placed on specific components of {{the car in the}} interest of equalizing competition and ensuring the safety of the drivers. Students are required to construct a survival cell (the chassis), which can resist large amounts of energy {{in the event of a}} crash, with an energy <b>absorbing</b> <b>device</b> at the front of the vehicle. The nose cone of the Cal Poly FSAE car is constructed as a carbon fiber shell designed to act as this sacrificial energy <b>absorbing</b> <b>device.</b> One difficulty associated with using FRC materials is that the anisotropic properties can lead to a variety of complex failure modes such as buckling, delamination, matrix cracking, and fiber breakage, all of which absorb different amounts of energy.

This model uses the test results from another paper to construct an explicit non-linear dynamic analysis in Abaqus which simulates the axial crushing of a thin walled composite tube between two rigid plates. The modeling techniques discussed in this paper will be used as the basis for a future thesis dedicated to designing the nose cone for the Cal Poly FSAE car...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Mirage (Manli Cardiology, Singapore) bioresorbable microfiber sirolimus-eluting scaffold compared with the Absorb (Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, California) bioresorbable vascular scaffold in the treatment of stenotic target lesions located in native coronary arteries, ranging from >= 2. 25 to <= 4. 0 mm in diameter. Secondary objectives were to establish the medium-term safety, effectiveness, and performance of the Mirage device. BACKGROUND The current generation of bioresorbable scaffolds has several limitations, such as thick square struts with large footprints that preclude their deep embedment into the vessel wall, resulting in protrusion into the lumen with microdisturbance of flow. The Mirage sirolimus-eluting bioresorbable microfiber scaffold is designed to address these concerns. METHODS In this prospective, single-blind trial, 60 patients were randomly allocated in a 1 : 1 ratio to treatment with a Mirage sirolimus-eluting bioresorbable microfiber scaffold or an Absorb bioresorbable vascular scaffold. The clinical endpoints were assessed at 30 days and at 6 and 12 months. In-device angiographic late loss at 12 months was quantified. Secondary optical coherence tomographic endpoints were assessed post-scaffold implantation at 6 and 12 months. RESULTS Median angiographic post-procedural in-scaffold minimal luminal diameters of the Mirage and <b>Absorb</b> <b>devices</b> were 2. 38 mm (interquartile range [IQR]: 2. 06 to 2. 62 mm) and 2. 55 mm (IQR: 2. 26 to 2. 71 mm), respectively; the effect size (d) was +/- 0. 29. At 12 months, median angiographic in-scaffold minimal luminal diameters of the Mirage and <b>Absorb</b> <b>devices</b> were not statistically different (1. 90 mm [IQR: 1. 57 to 2. 31 mm] vs. 2. 29 mm [IQR: 1. 74 to 2. 51 mm], d = - 0. 36). At 12 -month follow-up, median in-scaffold late luminal loss with the Mirage and <b>Absorb</b> <b>devices</b> was 0. 37 mm (IQR: 0. 08 to 0. 72 mm) and 0. 23 mm (IQR: 0. 15 to 0. 37 mm), respectively (d = 0. 20). On optical coherence tomography, post-procedural diameter stenosis with the Mirage was 11. 2 +/- 7. 1 %, which increased to 27. 4 +/- 12. 4 % at 6 months and remained stable (31. 8 +/- 12. 9 %) at 1 year, whereas the post-procedural optical coherence tomographic diameter stenosis with the Absorb was 8. 4 +/- 6. 6 %, which increased to 16. 6 +/- 8. 9 % and remained stable (21. 2 +/- 9. 9 %) at 1 -year follow-up (Mirage vs. Absorb: d(post-procedure) +/- 0. 41, d(6 months) +/- 1. 00, d(12 months) +/- 0. 92). Angiographic median in-scaffold diameter stenosis was significantly different between study groups at 12 months (28. 6 % [IQR: 21. 0 % to 40. 7 %] for the Mirage, 18. 2 % [IQR: 13. 1 % to 31. 6 %] for the Absorb, d +/- 0. 39). Device-and patient-oriented composite endpoints were comparable between the 2 study groups. CONCLUSIONS At 12 months, angiographic in-scaffold late loss was not statistically different between the Mirage and <b>Absorb</b> <b>devices,</b> although diameter stenosis on angiography and on optical coherence tomography was significantly higher with the Mirage than with the Absorb. The technique of implantation was suboptimal for both devices, and future trials should incorporate optical coherence tomographic guidance to allow optimal implantation and appropriate assessment of the new technology, considering the novel mechanical properties of the Mirage.

40|$|Foam-filled conical tubes have {{recently}} emerged as efficient energy <b>absorbing</b> <b>devices</b> {{to mitigate the}} adverse effects of impacts. The primary aim of this thesis was to generate research and design information on the impact and energy absorption response of empty and foam-filled conical tubes, and to facilitate their application in energy absorbing systems under axial and oblique loading conditions representative of those typically encountered in crashworthiness and impact applications. Finite element techniques supported by experiments and existing results {{were used in the}} investigation. Major findings show that the energy absorption response can be effectively controlled by varying geometry and material parameters. A useful empirical formula was developed for providing engineering designers with an initial estimate of the load ratio and hence energy absorption performances of these devices. It was evident that foam-filled conical tubes enhance the energy absorption capacity and stabilise the crush response for both axial and oblique impact loading without {{a significant increase in the}} initial peak load. This is practically beneficial when higher kinetic energy needs to be absorbed, thus reducing the impact force transmitted to the protected structure and occupants. Such tubes also increase and maintain the energy absorption capacity under global bending as well as minimise the reduction of energy absorption capacity with increasing load angle. Furthermore, the results also highlight the feasibility of adding a foam-filled conical tube as a supplementary <b>device</b> in energy <b>absorbing</b> systems, since the overall energy absorption performance of such systems can be favourably enhanced by only including a relatively small energy <b>absorbing</b> <b>device.</b> Above all, the results demonstrate the superior performance of foam-filled conical tube for mitigating impact energy in impact and crashworthiness applications...|$|R
