60|$|The {{noise of}} <b>sun-blinds</b> being raised vibrated through the house. A feeling of terror {{seized on the}} girl; he lay so still, and yet the drawing of each breath was a fight. If she could only suffer in his place! She went close, and bent over him.|$|E
6000|$|With {{her hand}} in his, Mr. Bosengate went on, through the drawing-room, long and cool, with <b>sun-blinds</b> down, through the billiard-room, high and cool, through the conservatory, green and sweet-smelling, out on to the terrace and the upper lawn. He had never felt such sheer exhilarated joy in his home surroundings, so cool, glistening and green under the July sun; and he said: ...|$|E
6000|$|Old Jolyon {{straightened}} the doll. [...] "Beauty!" [...] he ejaculated: [...] "Ha! Yes! A sad business!" [...] and {{he moved}} towards the house. Through a French window, under <b>sun-blinds</b> not yet drawn up, he preceded her into the room where he was wont to study The Times and the sheets of an agricultural magazine, with huge illustrations of mangold wurzels, and the like, which provided Holly with material for her paint brush.|$|E
6000|$|... "I shore do, Miss Hammond," [...] replied Nels, gravely. [...] "I've seen a few <b>sun-blinded</b> an' locoed an' snake-poisoned an' skunk-bitten cow-punchers in my day, but Gene Stewart beats 'em all. He's shore runnin' wild fer the divide." ...|$|R
6000|$|Vanderbank {{had reached}} {{one of the}} windows, shaded from without by a great striped <b>sun-blind</b> beneath which and between the flower-pots of the balcony {{he could see a}} stretch of hot relaxed street. He looked a minute at these things. [...] "I do so like your phrases!" ...|$|R
60|$|As a {{small crowd}} had collected, and as the joke was {{drifting}} rather too far in the cabman's direction, we climbed in without further parley, and were driven away amid cheers. We stopped the cab at a boot shop a little past Astley's Theatre that looked {{the sort of place}} we wanted. It was one of those overfed shops that the moment their shutters are taken down in the morning disgorge their goods all round them. Boxes of boots stood piled on the pavement or in the gutter opposite. Boots hung in festoons about its doors and windows. Its <b>sun-blind</b> was as some grimy vine, bearing bunches of black and brown boots. Inside, the shop was a bower of boots. The man, when we entered, was busy with a chisel and hammer opening a new crate full of boots.|$|R
60|$|Their dressing-cases were {{strapped}} together {{behind and}} Lady Cynthia {{sank into the}} cushions by his side. They drove away from the house, Francis with a backward glance of regret. The striped <b>sun-blinds</b> had been lowered over all the windows, thrushes and blackbirds were twittering on the lawn, the air was sweet with the perfume of flowers, a boatman was busy with the boats. Out beyond, through the trees, the river wound its placid way.|$|E
6000|$|He woke in {{the morning}} so unrefreshed and strengthless that he sent for the doctor. After {{sounding}} him, the fellow pulled a face {{as long as your}} arm, and ordered him to stay in bed and give up smoking. That was no hardship; there was nothing to get up for, and when he felt ill, tobacco always lost its savour. He spent the morning languidly with the <b>sun-blinds</b> down, turning and re-turning The Times, not reading much, the dog Balthasar lying beside his bed. With his lunch they brought him a telegram, running thus: ...|$|E
60|$|Old Jolyon {{followed}} a very little maid--not more than sixteen one would say--into {{a very small}} drawing-room where the <b>sun-blinds</b> were drawn. It held a cottage piano and little else save a vague fragrance and good taste. He stood in the middle, with his top hat in his hand, and thought: 'I expect she's very badly off!' There was a mirror above the fireplace, and he saw himself reflected. An old-looking chap! He heard a rustle, and turned round. She was so close that his moustache almost brushed her forehead, just under her hair.|$|E
60|$|It is {{the hottest}} long {{vacation}} known for many years. All the young clerks are madly in love, and according to their various degrees, pine for bliss with the beloved object, at Margate, Ramsgate, or Gravesend. All the middle-aged clerks think their families too large. All the unowned dogs who stray into the Inns of Court and pant about staircases and other dry places seeking water give short howls of aggravation. All the blind men's dogs in the streets draw their masters against pumps or trip them over buckets. A shop with a <b>sun-blind,</b> and a watered pavement, {{and a bowl of}} gold and silver fish in the window, is a sanctuary. Temple Bar gets so hot that it is, to the adjacent Strand and Fleet Street, what a heater is in an urn, and keeps them simmering all night.|$|R
60|$|For a {{while this}} {{blackness}} soothed {{the pain of}} Hare's <b>sun-blinded</b> eyes. It {{was a relief to}} have the unattainable horizon line blotted out. But by-and-by the opaque gloom brought home to him, as the day had never done, the reality of his solitude. He was alone in this immense place of barrenness, and his dumb companions were the world to him. Wolf pattered onward, a silent guide; and Silvermane followed, never lagging, sure-footed in the dark, faithful to his master. All the love Hare had borne the horse was as nothing to that which came to him on this desert night. In and out, round and round, ever winding, ever zigzagging, Silvermane hung close to Wolf, and the sandy lanes between the bowlders gave forth no sound. Dog and horse, free to choose their trail, trotted onward miles and miles into the night.|$|R
60|$|After my {{five years}} in solitary, when they took me away from San Quentin for my trial, I saw Skysail Jack. I could see little, for I was {{blinking}} in the sunshine like a bat, {{after five years of}} darkness; yet I saw enough of Skysail Jack to pain my heart. It was in crossing the Prison Yard that I saw him. His hair had turned white. He was prematurely old. His chest had caved in. His cheeks were sunken. His hands shook as with palsy. He tottered as he walked. And his eyes blurred with tears as he recognized me, for I, too, was a sad wreck of what had once been a man. I weighed eighty-seven pounds. My hair, streaked with gray, was a five- years' growth, as were my beard and moustache. And I, too, tottered as I walked, so that the guards helped to lead me across that <b>sun-blinding</b> patch of yard. And Skysail Jack and I peered and knew each other under the wreckage.|$|R
60|$|Certain of {{the great}} roads going north out of London {{continue}} far into the country a sort of attenuated and interrupted spectre of a street, with great gaps in the building, but preserving the line. Here will be a group of shops, followed by a fenced field or paddock, and then a famous public-house, and then perhaps a market garden or a nursery garden, and then one large private house, and then another field and another inn, and so on. If anyone walks along one of these roads he will pass a house which will probably catch his eye, though {{he may not be}} able to explain its attraction. It is a long, low house, running parallel with the road, painted mostly white and pale green, with a veranda and <b>sun-blinds,</b> and porches capped with those quaint sort of cupolas like wooden umbrellas that one sees in some old-fashioned houses. In fact, it is an old-fashioned house, very English and very suburban in the good old wealthy Clapham sense. And yet the house has a look of having been built chiefly for the hot weather. Looking at its white paint and <b>sun-blinds</b> one thinks vaguely of pugarees and even of palm trees. I cannot trace the feeling to its root; perhaps the place was built by an Anglo-Indian.|$|E
60|$|Drowsily they whirred {{all through}} this sunny day, making the {{passenger}} more sleepy and more hot {{as he passed}} the humming walls of the mills. <b>Sun-blinds,</b> and sprinklings of water, a little cooled the main streets and the shops; but the mills, and the courts and alleys, baked at a fierce heat. Down upon the river that was black and thick with dye, some Coketown boys who were at large - a rare sight there - rowed a crazy boat, which made a spumous track upon the water as it jogged along, while every dip of an oar stirred up vile smells. But the sun itself, however beneficent, generally, was less kind to Coketown than hard frost, and rarely looked intently into any of its closer regions without engendering more death than life. So does the eye of Heaven itself become an evil eye, when incapable or sordid hands are interposed {{between it and the}} things it looks upon to bless.|$|E
6000|$|Fiorsen's bedroom was--as {{the maid}} would remark--"a proper pigsty"--until {{he was out}} of it and it could be renovated each day. He had a talent for disorder, so that the room looked as if three men instead of one had gone to bed in it. Clothes and shoes, brushes, water, tumblers, breakfast-tray, newspapers, French novels, and cigarette-ends--none were ever where they should have been; and the stale fumes from the many {{cigarettes}} he smoked before getting up incommoded anyone whose duty it was to take him tea and shaving-water. When, on that first real summer day, the maid had brought Rosek up to him, he had been lying a long time on his back, dreamily watching the smoke from his cigarette and four flies waltzing in the sunlight that filtered through the green <b>sun-blinds.</b> This hour, before he rose, was his creative moment, when he could best see the form of music and feel inspiration for its rendering. Of late, he had been stale and wretched, all that side of him dull; but this morning he felt again the delicious stir of fancy, that vibrating, half-dreamy state when emotion seems so easily to find shape and the mind pierces through to new expression. Hearing the maid's knock, and her murmured: [...] "Count Rosek to see you, sir," [...] he thought: 'What the devil does he want?' A larger nature, drifting without control, in contact with a smaller one, who knows his own mind exactly, will instinctively be irritable, though he may fail to grasp what his friend is after.|$|E
40|$|Though {{ultraviolet}} warning {{systems are}} working at <b>sun-blind</b> wave-band, while this paper reveals {{that in the}} ultraviolet (UV) images of the systems for missile approaching, there exist strong noise and burst interferences coming from UV CCD electronic sensors and high gain amplifiers. The CCD interferences can not be effectively removed by classical 2 -D filtering algorithms, while they will influence the detection of the missile target in the ultraviolet images. To solve the problem, unchanging the current hardware structure of UV CCD electronic sensors, this paper develops a 3 -D filtering algorithm for imaging sequence based on a 3 -D recursive filter, which is stable and it extracts the missile target clearly. The proposed 3 -D recursive filter composes of a 2 -D spatial-filtering IIR and 1 -D time-filtering IIR, both are stable. The stability test algorithms are provided. The proposed 3 -D recursive filter is of much less computation amount UV image sequences and it can realize fast and real-time image filtering. Simulation experiments of UV image processing {{have shown that the}} proposed 3 -D filtering and related algorithms are correct effective and pragmatica 1...|$|R
60|$|On market morning, Carlisle woke up amazingly, {{and became}} (to the two Idle Apprentices) disagreeably and reproachfully busy. There were its cattle market, its sheep market, and its pig market {{down by the}} river, with raw-boned and shock-headed Rob Roys hiding their Lowland dresses beneath heavy plaids, prowling in and out among the animals, and {{flavouring}} the air with fumes of whiskey. There was its corn market down the main street, with hum of chaffering over open sacks. There was its general market in the street too, with heather brooms on which the purple flower still flourished, and heather baskets primitive and fresh to behold. With women trying on clogs and caps at open stalls, and 'Bible stalls' adjoining. With 'Doctor Mantle's Dispensary for the cure of all Human Maladies and no charge for advice,' and with Doctor Mantle's 'Laboratory of Medical, Chemical, and Botanical Science'--both healing institutions established on one pair of trestles, one board, and one <b>sun-blind.</b> With the renowned phrenologist from London, begging to be favoured (at sixpence each) with the company of clients of both sexes, to whom, on examination of their heads, he would make revelations 'enabling {{him or her to}} know themselves.' Through all these bargains and blessings, the recruiting-sergeant watchfully elbowed his way, a thread of War in the peaceful skein. Likewise on the walls were printed hints that the Oxford Blues might not be indisposed to hear of a few fine active young men; and that whereas the standard of that distinguished corps is full six feet, 'growing lads of five feet eleven' need not absolutely despair of being accepted.|$|R
60|$|I was met at {{the station}} at Lowell by a gentleman intimately {{connected}} with {{the management of the}} factories there; and gladly putting myself under his guidance, drove off at once to that quarter of the town in which the works, the object of my visit, were situated. Although only just of age - for if my recollection serve me, it has been a manufacturing town barely one-and-twenty years - Lowell is a large, populous, thriving place. Those indications of its youth which first attract the eye, give it a quaintness and oddity of character which, to a visitor from the old country, is amusing enough. It was a very dirty winter's day, and nothing in the whole town looked old to me, except the mud, which in some parts was almost knee-deep, and might have been deposited there, on the subsiding of the waters after the Deluge. In one place, there was a new wooden church, which, having no steeple, and being yet unpainted, looked like an enormous packing-case without any direction upon it. In another there was a large hotel, whose walls and colonnades were so crisp, and thin, and slight, that it had exactly the appearance of being built with cards. I was careful not to draw my breath as we passed, and trembled when I saw a workman come out upon the roof, lest with one thoughtless stamp of his foot he should crush the structure beneath him, and bring it rattling down. The very river that moves the machinery in the mills (for they are all worked by water power), seems to acquire a new character from the fresh buildings of bright red brick and painted wood among which it takes its course; and to be as light- headed, thoughtless, and brisk a young river, in its murmurings and tumblings, as one would desire to see. One would swear that every 'Bakery,' 'Grocery,' and 'Bookbindery,' and other kind of store, took its shutters down for the first time, and started in business yesterday. The golden pestles and mortars fixed as signs upon the <b>sun-blind</b> frames outside the Druggists', appear to have been just turned out of the United States' Mint; and when I saw a baby of some week or ten days old in a woman's arms at a street corner, I found myself unconsciously wondering where it came from: never supposing for an instant {{that it could have been}} born in such a young town as that.|$|R
6000|$|Sauntering forth {{into the}} town, {{by way of}} the covered and {{pillared}} entrance to the Dolphin's Yard, once redolent of soup and stable- litter, now redolent of musty disuse, I paced the street. It was a hot day, and the little <b>sun-blinds</b> of the shops were all drawn down, and the more enterprising tradesmen had caused their 'Prentices to trickle water on the pavement appertaining to their frontage. It looked {{as if they had been}} shedding tears for the stage-coaches, and drying their ineffectual pocket-handkerchiefs. Such weakness would have been excusable; for business was--as one dejected porkman who kept a shop which refused to reciprocate the compliment by keeping him, informed me--'bitter bad.' Most of the harness-makers and corn-dealers were gone the way of the coaches, but it was a pleasant recognition of the eternal procession of Children down that old original steep Incline, the Valley of the Shadow, that those tradesmen were mostly succeeded by vendors of sweetmeats and cheap toys. The opposition house to the Dolphin, once famous as the New White Hart, had long collapsed. In a fit of abject depression, it had cast whitewash on its windows, and boarded up its front door, and reduced itself to a side entrance; but even that had proved a world too wide for the Literary Institution which had been its last phase; for the Institution had collapsed too, and of the ambitious letters of its inscription on the White Hart's front, all had fallen off but these: ...|$|E
60|$|Perhaps a man never sees {{so much at}} {{a glance}} as when {{he is in a}} {{situation}} of extremity. The chances are a hundred to one, that if Barnaby had lounged in at the gate to look about him, he would have lounged out again with a very imperfect idea of the place, and would have remembered very little about it. But as he was taken handcuffed across the gravelled area, nothing escaped his notice. The dry, arid look of the dusty square, and of the bare brick building; the clothes hanging at some of the windows; and the men in their shirt-sleeves and braces, lolling with half their bodies out of the others; the green <b>sun-blinds</b> at the officers' quarters, and the little scanty trees in front; the drummer-boys practising in a distant courtyard; the men at drill on the parade; the two soldiers carrying a basket between them, who winked to each other as he went by, and slily pointed to their throats; the spruce serjeant who hurried past with a cane in his hand, and under his arm a clasped book with a vellum cover; the fellows in the ground-floor rooms, furbishing and brushing up their different articles of dress, who stopped to look at him, and whose voices as they spoke together echoed loudly through the empty galleries and passages;--everything, down to the stand of muskets before the guard-house, and the drum with a pipe-clayed belt attached, in one corner, impressed itself upon his observation, as though he had noticed them in the same place a hundred times, or had been a whole day among them, in place of one brief hurried minute.|$|E
60|$|When {{he reached}} home {{next day he}} went out to the flower garden, {{and with the help of}} Holly, who was very {{delicate}} with flowers, gathered a great bunch of carnations. They were, he told her, for 'the lady in grey'--a name still bandied between them; and he put them in a bowl in his study where he meant to tackle Irene the moment she came, on the subject of June and future lessons. Their fragrance and colour would help. After lunch he lay down, for he felt very tired, and the carriage would not bring her from the station till four o'clock. But as the hour approached he grew restless, and sought the schoolroom, which overlooked the drive. The <b>sun-blinds</b> were down, and Holly was there with Mademoiselle Beauce, sheltered from the heat of a stifling July day, attending to their silkworms. Old Jolyon had a natural antipathy to these methodical creatures, whose heads and colour reminded him of elephants; who nibbled such quantities of holes in nice green leaves; and smelled, as he thought, horrid. He sat down on a chintz-covered windowseat whence he could see the drive, and get what air there was; and the dog Balthasar who appreciated chintz on hot days, jumped up beside him. Over the cottage piano a violet dust-sheet, faded almost to grey, was spread, and on it the first lavender, whose scent filled the room. In spite of the coolness here, perhaps because of that coolness the beat of life vehemently impressed his ebbed-down senses. Each sunbeam which came through the chinks had annoying brilliance; that dog smelled very strong; the lavender perfume was overpowering; those silkworms heaving up their grey-green backs seemed horribly alive; and Holly's dark head bent over them had a wonderfully silky sheen. A marvellous cruelly strong thing was life when you were old and weak; it seemed to mock you with its multitude of forms and its beating vitality. He had never, till those last few weeks, had this curious feeling of being with one half of him eagerly borne along in the stream of life, and with the other half left on the bank, watching that helpless progress. Only when Irene was with him did he lose this double consciousness.|$|E
30|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to develop, {{implement}} and test voice control of operational and technical functions in a smart building. The final implementation was performed on a simulation model of a smart apartment. This model is able to simulate control of lighting, <b>sun-blinds</b> and air conditioning. Another task was to design a connection of the voice recognition system to the KNX bus and connection of the smart building simulation model. After performing an analysis of available and usable voice recognition systems, a set of criteria was established in order to enable the final implementation of the created system. The main criterion for {{the selection of the}} final solution was the price of the application. Use of the Microsoft SAPI module is free in the English version of the Windows system, however, an application to communicate with the KNX bus system on the user side {{and on the other side}} had to be created.|$|E
