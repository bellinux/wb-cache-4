5|$|In 1381 the Peasants' Revolt {{broke out}} in England, during which Gaunt was {{targeted}} by the rebels as an especially hated member of the administration. He found himself <b>stranded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north of England {{in the early part}} of the revolt but considered Dunstanburgh insufficiently secure to function as a safe haven, and was forced to turn to Alnwick Castle instead, which refused to let him in, fearing that his presence would invite a rebel attack.|$|E

50|$|During DNA replication, DNA polymerases {{elongate}} new {{strands of}} DNA against complementary template strands. Most DNA polymerases comprise two different enzymatic domains: a polymerase and a proofreading exonuclease. The polymerase elongates <b>the</b> new <b>strand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 5' → 3' direction. The exonuclease removes erroneous nucleotides from <b>the</b> same <b>strand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 3’ → 5’ direction. This exonuclease activity {{is essential for}} a DNA polymerase's ability to proofread. Deletions inactivating or removing these nucleases increases rates of mutation and mortality in affected microbes and cancer in mice.|$|R

5|$|Cochrane was {{transferred}} to the North America and West Indies station in November 1917, but rejoined the 2nd Cruiser Squadron early in 1918. She was based in Murmansk between March and September 1918 during the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. She ferried Soviet troops to Pechenga on 3 May to forestall an attempt by White Finns to seize the town. On 14 November 1918 she was <b>stranded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mersey Estuary, while {{under the control of the}} pilot, and later broke in two, becoming a total loss.

5|$|Following a {{distress}} signal, the TARDIS lands {{aboard a}} 17th-century pirate ship <b>stranded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{middle of an}} ocean. The ship's crew have been terrorised by a Siren-like creature (Lily Cole) who marks people with black spots on their palms after they are injured. Her song then lulls victims into a trance, making them {{want to go to}} her, which apparently disintegrates them. Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) receives a cut during a tussle with the pirates, and finds a black spot on his hand, but is prevented from succumbing to the song of the Siren by Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and the Doctor (Matt Smith).|$|E

Thrilled with the new RV, Homer takes his family on an excursion.

5|$|Prior to the {{announcement}} of a new Star Trek incarnation, Star Trek: Voyager co-creators Rick Berman, Michael Piller, and Jeri Taylor conceived the basic concepts and characters during secret developmental meetings. The Kazon were originally created {{as a part of}} the show's basic premise of Voyagers crew being <b>stranded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Delta Quadrant. Berman, Piller, and Taylor reasoned that the characters would be traveling through an area of space controlled by a new alien race, serving as the show's primary antagonists, and created the Kazon to fill this role.|$|E
5|$|Rainfall up to 5in (127mm) in Massachusetts {{caused a}} river in Somerset to {{overflow}} its banks, flooding nearby areas with 2feet (0.6m) of water.

2500|$|The SH3-type barrel {{tertiary}} {{structure of the}} LSm fold is formed by the strongly bent (about 120°) β2, β3 and β4 strands, with the barrel structure closed by the β5 strand. [...] Emphasizing the {{tertiary structure}}, each bent beta strand {{can be described as}} two shorter beta strands. [...] The LSm fold can be viewed as an eight-strand anti-parallel beta sandwich, with five <b>strands</b> <b>in</b> one plane and three <b>strands</b> <b>in</b> a parallel plane with about a 45° pitch angle between the two halves of the beta sandwich. [...] The short (two to four turns) N-terminal alpha helix occurs at one edge of the beta sandwich. [...] This alpha helix and the beta strands can be labeled (from the N-terminus to the C-terminus) α, β1, β2a, β2b, β3a, β3b, β4a, β4b, β5 where the a and b refer to either the two halves of a bent <b>strand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> five-strand description, or to <b>the</b> individual <b>strands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eight-strand description. [...] Each <b>strand</b> (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> eight-strand description) is formed from five amino acid residues. Including the bends and loops between the strands, and the alpha helix, about 60 amino acid residues contribute to the LSm fold, but this varies between homologs due to variation <b>in</b> inter-strand loops, <b>the</b> alpha helix, and even the lengths of β3b and β4a strands.|$|R
