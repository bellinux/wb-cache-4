40|$|In {{this very}} brief paper I suggest two reasons why reparations {{in the form}} of <b>specific</b> <b>restitution</b> for {{unjustly}} expropriated property should be awarded only in exceptional cases. <b>Specific</b> <b>restitution</b> is a unique form of reparations. It is neither the only nor the best means of recognizing the legitimacy of claims brought by the many victims of atrocities committed in the past half-century. The tragic fact is that no form of reparation can truly compensate those who have endured so much. We have only inadequate choices available to us. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{bank draft}} or {{certified}} cheque (2 ̆ 2 banker 2 ̆ 7 s instrument 2 ̆ 2) is a negotiable instrument {{on which a}} bank is obligated, used by a paying party in payment to a creditor. The issue explored {{in this article is}} the autonomy of the banker 2 ̆ 7 s obligation on the banker 2 ̆ 7 s instrument, namely whether the payee-creditor may enforce it irrespective of the obligated bank 2 ̆ 7 s defences against the paying party, {{as well as of the}} paying party 2 ̆ 7 s defences against the payee-creditor. From a doctrinal point of view, the questions are whether the payee-creditor can be a holder in due course (so as not to be subject to the obligated bank 2 ̆ 7 s defences against the paying party), and whether jus tertii, that is, a defence based on rights ofa thirdparty (here the payingparty), is available to the obligated bankagainsta holdernot in due course. This article answers thefirst question in the affirmative butprovides only apartly affirmative answer to the second. The conclusion is thus that as a holder in due course the-payee-creditor takes the banker 2 ̆ 7 s instrumentfreefrom the obligated bank 2 ̆ 7 s defences against thepayingparty. At the same time, as a holder notin due course, the payee-creditor holds the instrument subject to the obligated bank 2 ̆ 7 s defences against thepaying party; regardless ofwhether thepayingpartyjoins the action ofthe payee-creditor against the obligated bank, the payee-creditor holds the instrument subject also to thepaying party 2 ̆ 7 s claimfor the <b>specific</b> <b>restitution</b> of the instrument. Contract defences of the paying party against the payeecreditor, other than the retroactive cancellation oftheir contract leading to such a claimfor the restitution ofthe instrument, are not available to theobligated bank against the payee-creditor. Autonomy is thus not entirely achieved...|$|E
40|$|The text argues that, even if {{different}} {{sectors of society}} have some strategic points of agreement {{on the issue of}} land, which converge on the <b>specific</b> issue of <b>restitution,</b> they strongly disagree on various other points. On one side are some who advocate “pure restitution” and consequently support a restitution policy that focuses on correcting the illegal dispossession and clarifying land titles and individual rights to property, which would serve to boost the land market and allow for rural development policies that modernize agricultural production, fundamentally based on large, corporate ownership. On {{the other end of the}} spectrum are advocates of what we call “comprehensive restitution,” who promote adopting a restitution policy that meets the requirements not only of corrective justice but also of recognition and redistribution, advancing the interest of peasant, indigenous, and afro-Colombian communities...|$|R
40|$|Both the CESL and Belgian law {{adopt the}} {{principle}} that when a contract is avoided or terminated, each party has to make restitution of whatever it has received under that contract. For the CESL, this duty to make restitution is treated in detail in Chapter 17. Although this chapter has the general title of ‘Restitution’, its provisions only deal with restitution after avoidance or termination. Therefore, Chapter 17 {{does not apply to}} other cases of restitution, such as restitution after withdrawal of the contract (Articles 43 to 47 CESL) or restitution of additional payments in contracts between a trader and a consumer (Article 71 CESL). Contrary to the CESL, the Belgian Civil Code does not contain any <b>specific</b> provisions on <b>restitution</b> after avoidance or termination of a contract. The question of restitution after avoidance or termination of contracts is seen {{as one of the most}} complex and delicate questions of Belgian civil law. Case law and legal doctrine on this question lack consistency, which gives rise to many uncertainties. Therefore, the solution of the CESL, providing a detailed set of rules on restitution after avoidance or termination, seems at least to be preferable to the present state of Belgian law on this point. However, this paper will point out that Chapter 17 CESL on restitution has some serious shortcomings. Whereas the basic principles of the restitution regime in Chapter 17 deserve approval, the more detailed rules on restitution need to be revised...|$|R
40|$|Case law {{accurately}} delineates {{the four}} evolutionary stages of promissory estoppel. As an overview, promissory estoppel has evolved in American case law in four developmental stages: (1) Estoppel Phase, consisting initially of “defensive equitable estoppel” to estop contract defenses based on statutes of limitations and {{the statute of}} frauds. In {{the second part of}} this first phase, courts have extended “estoppel” based on representations of facts to “promissory” representations and enforced the promissory basis of the representation, thereby creating an affirmative theory of relief. Thus, this first phase of promissory estoppel consists of defensive equitable estoppel and offensive equitable estoppel. (2) Contract Phase, in which promissory estoppel has developed as a consideration substitute which courts have used to validate promises and award traditional contract expectation damages. (3) Tort Phase, in which courts have recognized a promisee 2 ̆ 7 s right to rely and a promisor 2 ̆ 7 s duty to prevent (or not cause) reasonably foreseeable, detrimental reliance. During this third phase, courts have applied promissory estoppel offensively (independent of contract) to award reliance damages. (4) Equity Phase, in which courts have assimilated the first three phases (estoppel, contract, and tort) and have applied promissory estoppel equitably to rectify wrongs by awarding relief based on the discrete facts of each case. The remedy is discretionary with no mechanical bright line rule; it is equitably molded for each case and may include the full range of remedies (expectation, reliance, <b>restitution,</b> <b>specific</b> performance and exemplary). Part II of this Article considers these four evolutionary phases...|$|R
40|$|After being {{considered}} as niche territory {{for a long}} period, conflicts of law and restitution has provided a fertile ground for exposition in recent times. Whilst some development on the jurisdictional front has occurred, choice of law has lagged behind somewhat as, in England at least, {{no one seemed to}} be quite sure what was or should be the choice of law rule for restitutionary claims. However, the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations (commonly known as the Rome II Regulation) has now entered into force and will apply from 11 January 2009. Article 10 of the Rome II Regulation sets out a choice of law rule for unjust enrichment. This article will focus on Article 10 and consider how well the Rome II Regulation caters for choice of law for restitution. Reference will be made to approaches that are or were taken in individual Member States and other countries in order to lay out the background in this area. The structure of this paper will be as follows. The first question that is dealt with is whether the appropriate terminology was adopted by Article 10 : should it be choice of law for ‘unjust enrichment’ or choice of law for ‘restitution’? Secondly, Article 10 adopts the framework of several rules pointing towards different connecting factors. These various specific choice of law rules will be considered in terms of their appropriateness and hierarchy towards each other. Thirdly, some <b>specific</b> problems concerning <b>restitution</b> for wrongs, proprietary restitution and renvoi will be examined...|$|R

Aqui, examinei no conjunto de narrativas desses atores como era vivida e sentida as políticas públicas de reparação. Explorei, etnograficamente, nos discursos a eficácia de tais medidas. Para tal, realizei o trabalho de campo a partir do segundo semestre de 2009 até dezembro de 2011, primeiramente na Comissão Especial sobre Mortos e Desaparecidos Políticos, Comissão de Direitos Humanos e Minorias da Câmara dos Deputados, nos Grupos Tortura Nunca Mais Rio e São Paulo, e, finalmente, na Comissão de Anistia. O objetivo da pesquisa esteve pautado na tentativa de compreender a dessintonia dos sensos de justiça dos familiares de desaparecidos e dos ex-presos políticos em relação às medidas de reparação empreendidas pelo Estado. Nestes termos, realizei um intenso diálogo com os “familiares de desaparecidos” do GTNM/RJ sobre alguns temas capazes de revelar as configurações de um insulto moral presente nas interações entre eles e as Comissões de Reparação. O desenho da tese foi pensado como uma peça de teatro, os atos/capítulos estão vinculados e refletem as interações e certos aspectos dos encontros intersubjetivos entre mim e os interlocutores, dos quais surgiram inquietações e insights. Em síntese, nas narrativas de meus interlocutores, a ideia de justiça aparecia vinculada à ideia de verdade e, a partir desse vínculo, pode ser dizer que os conteúdos das demandas de justiça voltavam-se para o desvelamento das circunstâncias que envolveram os desaparecimentos de algum familiar e os crimes de tortura a que foram submetidos os presos políticos. _______________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTThe Transitional Justice aims {{to address}} issues arising from violations committed during conflict or political violence. In Brazilian case, the transitional governments and subsequent civil administrations dealt with the disappearance cases discussing the relevance of compensation under {{the decisions of the}} Amnesty Commission and the Special Commission on Political Deaths and Disappearances. It is evident that Brazilian Human Rights organizations and activists have pursued a wide range of reparative goals corresponding to what the UN calls restitution, satisfaction, and guarantees of non-repetition. In according to the document, restitution involves, “whenever possible, restor[ing] the victim to the original situation before the gross violations of international human rights law or serious violations of humanitarian law occurred”. It also involves satisfaction measures which tends to encompass still more <b>specific</b> instances of <b>restitution,</b> such as “the search for the whereabouts of the disappeared for the bodies of those killed [and] assistance in the recovery, identification and reburial of the bodies in accordance with the expressed or presumed wish of the victims. The core value of transitional justice is the notion of justice: not necessarily criminal justice, but other forms of justice as well. This notion and the political transformation, such as regime change or transition from conflict, are thus linked toward a more peaceful, certain and democratic future. This thesis aims at understanding, from an anthropological perspective, the meaning of the actions for providing reparations to families of people who disappeared in circumstances of conflict or repression under former dictatorship. The research highlights that the impact of disappearances on the families is still devastating and long lasting, leaving them in a terrible limbo, unable to find closure. It also highlights that the victims are seeking the truth about what happened to the victims, because those actions would encompass the initiative that would allow to the actors in a country to investigate past abuses and seek redress for victims. These processes aim to enable societies to examine and come to terms with past crimes and human rights violations in order to prevent their recurrence. They help create documentation that prevents repressive regimes from rewriting history and denying the past. They can also help victims obtain closure by knowing the truth about what actually happened (such as to “disappeared” people) and understanding the atrocities they endured. Truth-seeking measures may include freedom of information legislation, declassification of archives, investigations, and truth commissions. At the same time, it reaches beyond the immediate communities of the disappeared, affecting entire societies grappling with the legacy of unresolved crimes and the obligation to provide families with the truth about the fate of their loved ones. Thus, from the “native” point of view, the former commissions restored only material damage, discarding the damages, which were the major injuries sustained by victims of political persecution. By doing so, the fixing of indemnification regarding the damage suffered by victims of political persecution covers only patrimonial damage, leaving out the injuries about the compensation of damages, and disregarding what really mattered {{in the lives of the}} families of the political disappeared...|$|R
