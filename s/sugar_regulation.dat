50|$|Land in the Redland Bay district, {{which extends}} from south of Cleveland {{to the lower}} Logan River district, and from the bay about 3 miles west to Mount Cotton, was taken up for closer {{settlement}} under the Cotton Regulations of 1860 and the Coffee and <b>Sugar</b> <b>Regulations</b> of 1864. There was also heavy logging of the valuable cedar and beech stands at this period. By the mid-1870s Redland Bay was well known as a sugar district, dominated by the Redland Bay Sugar Plantation. This had been established by the Newton family in the 1860s and by 1870 was the principal sugar cultivator and employer in the district. However, much of the land at Redland Bay had been taken up by speculators in the 1860s - by 1871 {{there were only a}} dozen or so Redland Bay farms (exclusive of the Redland Bay Plantation) and 1 farm at Mount Cotton, supporting a total population of 40. More extensive farming at Redland Bay did not develop until the 1880s, when boom prices encouraged the sale of land to farmers.|$|R
50|$|Bundaberg {{was first}} {{settled in the}} mid-1860s by timber cutters, with saw milling {{operative}} at Baffle Creek by 1866. John and Gavin Steuart secured a 320 acre land selection for timber and saw milling activities and other settlers followed. Leases for agricultural purposes followed the timber getting, with sugar plantations and maize cropping eventually taking precedence in the cleared areas. Agricultural settlement was encouraged by the Queensland government under the under the Coffee and <b>Sugar</b> <b>Regulations</b> of the 1860 Crown Lands Alienation Act. The first town survey for Bundaberg, situated on the Burnett River, was completed in 1869, ultimately establishing it as a service centre with harbour and port facilities for the agricultural and mineral produce of the area. During the following decade the sugar industry consolidated and a general economic boom in Queensland in the 1880s enhanced the local sugar boom. During the 1880s the Millaquin, Fairymead and Bingera sugar refineries were established providing the necessary infrastructure {{for the success of}} the fledgling industry. Thomas McIlwraith, Queensland Premier and Colonial Treasurer 1879-83 represented the electorate of Mulgrave, incorporating Bundaberg, during this period of growth.|$|R

5000|$|Glucose {{levels are}} usually {{lowest in the}} morning, before the first meal of the day (termed [...] "the fasting level"), and rise after meals {{for an hour or}} two by a few millimoles. Blood sugar levels outside the normal range may be an {{indicator}} of a medical condition. A persistently high level is referred to as hyperglycemia; low levels are referred to as hypoglycemia. Diabetes mellitus is characterized by persistent hyperglycemia from any of several causes, and is the most prominent disease related to failure of blood <b>sugar</b> <b>regulation.</b> Intake of alcohol causes an initial surge in blood sugar, and later tends to cause levels to fall. Also, certain drugs can increase or decrease glucose levels.|$|E
5000|$|Patients with {{fluctuating}} insulin requirements {{may benefit}} from a closed-loop predictive modeling approach. As an extension on [...] "carb counting", in this closed-loop predictive modeling approach, the four daily insulin dosages needed to reach the target blood sugar levels for the “normal” daily carbohydrate consumption and amount of physical activity, are continuously adjusted based on the pre-meal and pre-night blood sugar level readings. Each new blood sugar reading provides the feedback to fine-tune and track the body’s insulin requirements. Within this strategy the key patient specific factors, which have to be determined experimentally, are the blood sugar correction factor and the carbohydrate ratio. The blood sugar correction factor sets both the “proportional gain” and “integral gain” factors for the four feedback loops. When taken too low, deviations from the target blood sugar level are not corrected for effectively, when taken too high, the blood <b>sugar</b> <b>regulation</b> will become unstable. Since in this approach, the carbohydrate ratio is only used to account for non-standard carbohydrate intakes, it is usually not required to work with meal specific ratios.|$|E
40|$|In plants, sugars are {{required}} to sustain growth and regulate gene expression. A large set of genes are either up- or down-regulated by sugars; however, {{whether there is a}} common mechanism and signal transduction pathway for differential and coordinated <b>sugar</b> <b>regulation</b> remain unclear. In the present study, the rice (Oryza sativa cv Tainan 5) cell culture was used as a model system to address this question. Sucrose and glucose both played dual functions in gene regulation as exemplified by the up-regulation of growth-related genes and down-regulation of stress-related genes. Sugar coordinately but differentially activated or repressed gene expression, and nuclear run-on transcription and mRNA half-life analyses revealed regulation of both the transcription rate and mRNA stability. Although coordinately regulated by sugars, these growth- and stress-related genes were up-regulated or down-regulated through hexokinase-dependent and/or hexokinase-independent pathways. We also found that the sugar signal transduction pathway may overlap the glycolytic pathway for gene repression. α-Amylase and the stress-related genes identified in this study were coordinately expressed under sugar starvation, suggesting a convergence of the nutritional and environmental stress signal transduction pathways. Together, our studies provide a new insight into the complex signal transduction network and mechanisms of <b>sugar</b> <b>regulation</b> of growth and stress-related genes in plants...|$|E
50|$|The {{origin of}} Bundaberg's sugar {{industry}} dates {{back more than}} 100 years {{to the introduction of}} the <b>Sugar</b> and Coffee <b>Regulations</b> Act 1864.

40|$|Slavin* Added <b>sugar</b> <b>regulations</b> and {{recommendations}} {{have been proposed}} by policy makers around the world. With no universal definition, limited access to added sugar values in food products and no analytical difference from intrinsic sugars, added sugar recommendations present a unique challenge. Average added sugar intake by American adults is approximately 13 % of total energy intake, {{and recommendations}} have been made as low 5 % of total energy intake. In addition to public health recommendations, the Food and Drug Administration has proposed the inclusion of added sugar data to the Nutrition and Supplemental Facts Panel.

There are certainly advantages to including added sugar data to the Nutrition Facts Panel; however, consumer research does not consistently show the addition of this information to improve consumer knowledge.

40|$|In this thesis, <b>sugar</b> {{transport}} <b>regulation</b> {{was characterized}} {{in terms of}} the expression and subcellular distribution of the glucose transporter (GT) in the V 79 hamster fibroblast cell line, and in a respiration deficient mutant (G 14) of the V 79 cell line. In V 79, increases in the plasma membrane GT content correlated with the stimulatory effects of insulin and glucose deprivation. In contrast, the 3 -fold elevation in basal sugar transport observed in the G 14 cell line did not coincide with any significant difference in either the whole cell or plasma membrane GT content when compared to V 79 [...] suggesting an enhancement of the intrinsic activity of the GT expressed in G 14. A difference in the average molecular weights of the transporters was observable between the two cell lines, however. Treatment with endoglycosidase F or tunicamycin established that the G 14 cell line exhibited a hyperglycosylated form of the same core GT protein expressed in V 79. In a second study, the dramatic down-regulatory effects of D-allose were examined in both the G 14 and V 79 cell lines. In both cell lines, however, D-allose treatment did not alter GT content in either the whole cell or plasma membrane fractions. In this case, a negative regulatory effect on the intrinsic activity of the GT is implicated. The <b>regulation</b> of <b>sugar</b> transport through modulation of the intrinsic activity of the GT is a rapidly evolving theory. The continued study of novel instances of <b>sugar</b> uptake <b>regulation</b> such as these could provide clues as to the factors involved in such a mechanism...|$|R

40|$|The O-linked GlcNAc transferases (OGTs) are a {{recently}} characterized group of largely eukaryotic enzymes that add a single b-N-acetylglucosamine moiety to speci®c serine or threonine hydroxyls.

40|$|A {{full-length}} cDNA encoding a putative high-affinity nitrate transporter (ZmNrt 2. 2) from maize {{was isolated}} and characterised, together with another previously identified transporter (ZmNrt 2. 1), {{in terms of}} phylogenesis, protein structure prediction and regulation of transcript accumulation in response to nitrate and sugar availability. The expression of both genes was evaluated by quantitative and semi-quantitative RT-PCR in response to nitrate and sugar supply and the in planta localisation of mRNA was studied by in situ hybridisation. Data obtained suggested similar genetic evolution and identical transmembrane structure prediction between the two deduced proteins, and differences in both regulation of their expression and mRNA localisation in response to nitrate, leading us to hypothesise a principal role for ZmNRT 2. 1 in the influx activity and the major involvement of ZmNRT 2. 2 in the xylem loading process. Our data suggest opposing <b>sugar</b> <b>regulation</b> by ZmNrt 2. 1 and ZmNrt 2. 2 transcription in {{the presence or absence}} of nitrate and the existence of both hexokinase-dependent and hexokinase-independent transduction mechanisms for the regulation of ZmNrt 2. 1 and ZmNrt 2. 2 expression by sugars...|$|E
40|$|Plants are {{necessarily}} highly competitive and have finely tuned mechanisms to adjust {{growth and development}} in accordance with opportunities and limitations in their environment.
