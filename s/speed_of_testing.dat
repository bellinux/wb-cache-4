The actual {{rate of strain}} can be markedly different from the simple expression of (crosshead velocity+ gauge length) for nominal strain rate. As the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> machines is increased, an upper speed limit is set {{on the use of}} conventional machines by the effects of wave propagation in the testpiece: non-uniform stress and strain patterns are set up which make normal interpretation of mechanical property data very difficult. Some criteria determining the upper range of machine speeds are given in terms of the machine stiffness and specimen size. These bounds are further modified at high testing rates by the acceleration available on the machine-drive system. The overall restrictive limits are more noticeable the slower the propagation of waves in the testpiece, i. e. the limiting speed is lower for polymers than for metals...|$|E

By using ultrasonic surface waves generated and detected in a pitch-catch manner we can detect such defects with a much higher accuracy. We use electro-magnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs) to generate and detect the ultrasound. These have the advantage of being non-contact and require no couplant. It is not sufficient to merely detect the presence of a defect; hence accurate calibration of the system is required. We present measurements on calibration samples giving the response of the system to defects of different depths. Further experiments have been performed on rail samples containing real and manufactured PF defects, both longitudinal and transverse. Using the change in signal amplitude and frequency content we are able to give a depth and position for these defects, and these are compared with more established measurement methods.

40|$|Prolonged {{exposure}} (adaptation) to {{a stimulus}} drifting {{at a constant}} speed can bias the perceived <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> stimuli subsequently presented in the same location. Following adaptation, the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> a <b>test</b> stimulus drifting at an identical or slower rate than the adaptor will generally be underestimated, while the <b>speeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> stimuli drifting faster than the adaptor will be overestimated. These biases {{can be used to}} infer the nature of the neural mechanism(s) that encode motion. It has recently been proposed that a combination of two distinct mechanisms, one tuned to direction and another that is non-directional, can best account for post adaptation biases in perceived speed. To assess this possibility, the non-directional mechanism was selectively adapted, as was a combination of the directional and non-directional mechanism. Doing so revealed that the non-directional mechanism is not tuned for movement per se, but for simple local rates of change (or temporal frequency). The directional mechanisms, however, was tuned for stimulus speed. The results suggest that outputs from these two mechanisms are summated, and based on the summated biases obtained from Experiment 1, we were able to predict a novel motion phenomenon – a dynamic motion aftereffect that is seen to move in same direction as adaptation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an effective classification method based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) {{in the context}} of activity recognition. Local features that capture both spatial and temporal information in activity videos have made significant progress recently. Efficient and effective features, feature representation and classification plays a crucial role in activity recognition. For classification, SVMs are popularly used because of their simplicity and efficiency; however the common multi-class SVM approaches applied suffer from limitations including having easily confused classes and been computationally inefficient. We propose using a binary tree SVM to address the shortcomings of multi-class SVMs in activity recognition. We proposed constructing a binary tree using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), where activities are repeatedly allocated to subnodes until every new created node contains only one activity. Then, for each internal node a separate SVM is learned to classify activities, which significantly reduces the training time and increases the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> compared to popular the `one-against-the-rest' multi-class SVM classifier.

Because of its relative simplicity and <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing,</b> the variety of stimuli that can be used, and its ecological validity across species, {{it is also an}} attractive task for comparative research. To date, variants of this test have been used with vertebrate and invertebrate species, but the methods have seldom been sufficiently standardized to allow cross-species comparison. Here, we review the methods necessary for the study of novel object recognition in mammalian and non-mammalian models, as well as the results of these experiments. Critical to the use of this test is an understanding of the organism’s initial response to a novel object, the modulation of exploration by context, and species differences in object perception and exploratory behaviors. We argue that with appropriate consideration of species differences in perception, object affordances, and natural exploratory behaviors, the spontaneous object recognition test can be a valid and versatile tool for translational research with non-mammalian models...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Although {{computer}} systems penetrate {{all facets of}} society, the software running those systems may contain many errors. Producing high quality software appears to be dicult and very expensive. Even determining the quality of software is not easy. Testing {{is by far the}} most used way to estimate the quality of software. Testing itself is not easy and time consuming. In order to reduce the costs and increase the quality and <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing,</b> testing should be automated itself. An automatical specication based test tool generates test data, executes the associated tests, and makes a fully automatically verdict based on a formal specication. Advantages of this approach are that one species properties instead of instances of these properties, test data are derived automatically instead of manually, the tests performed are always up to date with the current specication, and automatic testing is fast and accurate. We will show that functions in a functional programming language can be used very well to model properties. One branch of the automatic test system Gast handles logical properties relating function arguments and results of a single function call. The other branch of Gast handles speci cations of systems with an internal state. ...|$|E

A problem when developing for inspection of cargo holds is the lack of real world testing opportunities, slowing down development. In this thesis a simulation framework has been developed to speed up the development of autonomous inspection. Furthermore, navigation tools needed for autonomous flight has been implemented and tested within the framework. The simulation framework uses the Gazebo simulator and the Robot Operating System environment to create a framework which focuses on clean interfaces, ease of use, and portability to real world usage. The navigation tools developed were a collision avoidance algorithm and a Simultaneous Localisation And Mapping (SLAM) algorithm, both relying on a 2 d-scanning lidar. Being tested in the simulator, the navigation tools performed well, both in normal surroundings and that of a cargo hold, though the size and openness of the cargo hold made the performance very reliant on the range of the lidar.

Improving the testing system sensitivity will improve the accuracy of residual lifetime predictions. This leads {{to the development of}} new inspection technique. Typically inspection of welding joints comes under purview of many standards and has become a common practice. When it comes to pipe body, non-availability of standards limits the usage of commonly used testing techniques. Testing of large areas require large amount of time using conventional bulk wave testing. The presence of the anti-corrosion coating makes the testing more complex. The solution for the above problem is to use guided waves, which improves the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing.</b> The ultrasonic long-range inspection using guided waves made significant progress in the last 10 - 15 years. Generating guided waves at one location can cover very long range. Using this technique, corrosion damage as well as cracks in the pipe section can be detected. In order to obtain a larger range capability low-frequency ultrasonic waves (20 - 250 kHz) are used. The ultrasonic testing over distances up to 100 meters and more is possible. The testing systems more commonly available in the market for the long-range inspection use piezoelectric probes. Low-frequency electromagnetic US-transducers were developed in Fraunhofer-IZFP, which allow transmitting and receiving of the ultrasonic mode SS 0 in thin-walled inspection objects like pipes, plates, tanks and containers.

The predictions of plastic flow were in good agreement with the observed shape at fracture of specimens tested dynamically in a unique impact test facility known as the 'flying wedge' which is capable of applying strain-rates in the range 102 - 104 s- 1. The DYNA 2 D results were used to give accurate predictions of the triaxial state-of-stress (defined as the ratio of mean stress P to effective stress Y) at the fracture initiation site as a function of initial geometry, mean strain and strain-rate. Experimentally-measured failure strains were then plotted against predicted values of P/Y for each material. For copper, failure strains decreased with increasing stress triaxiality P/Y but no significant strain-rate effect was apparent. In the case of iron, the same trend of reducing fracture strain with increase in P/Y was observed, but here increased strain-rate produced a marked effect. In fact, a ductile-brittle transition (confirmed by metallurgical examination) was seen to occur at the highest <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>testing</b> and above a certain value of P/Y. Parameters for simple empirical fracture models were estimated from the plots of failure strain versus P/Y.
