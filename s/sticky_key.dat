50|$|Over the years, {{this feature}} has posed {{difficulties}} for users {{who use the}} Shift key heavily, such as gamers, because an activation popup will be placed above all other applications, disturbing their gameplay. This can be fixed by going into the control panel and going into the accessibility option and then disabling the shortcut option. The feature creates a vulnerability in some versions of Windows, enabling the recovery or replacement of the user password using a method known as a <b>Sticky</b> <b>key</b> attack.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sticky</b> <b>Keys</b> {{makes an}} alert sound on Windows {{computers}} and laptops, but on Mac or Apple computers, {{it makes a}} quiet tapping sound. On Mac, <b>Sticky</b> <b>Keys</b> is pressed only once on the shift key.|$|R

50|$|In 1994, Solaris 2.4 shipped {{with the}} AccessX utility, which also {{provided}} <b>sticky</b> <b>keys</b> and mouse keys functionality.|$|R
50|$|Some {{features}} include Narrator, Magnifier, High Contrast, On Screen Keyboard, <b>Sticky</b> <b>Keys,</b> Toggle Keys, Filter Keys, and Mouse Keys.|$|R
50|$|To {{turn off}} once enabled, just simply press 3 {{or more of}} the <b>Sticky</b> <b>Keys</b> (Ctrl, Alt, Shift, Windows Button) at the same time.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sticky</b> <b>Keys</b> {{was first}} {{introduced}} to Mac OS in System 6 {{as part of the}} Easy Access extension, which also included mouse keys functionality.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Sticky</b> <b>keys</b> allows {{characters}} or {{commands to}} be typed {{without having to}} hold down a modifier key (Shift, Ctrl, Alt) while pressing a second key. Similarly, ClickLock is a Microsoft Windows feature that remembers a mouse button is down so that items can be highlighted or dragged without holding the mouse button down while scrolling.|$|R
50|$|Problems with keys {{sticking}} {{have been}} reported, {{caused by the}} plastic reacting with the grease used to form an adhesive-like substance. This has been recognised by Yamaha.Yamaha originally offered to replace the key-bed (part cost only) if <b>sticky</b> <b>keys</b> were experienced. In 2012 this changed to labor cost only. On December 31, 2013, the replacement program ended, and customers paid both parts and labor from that date.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sticky</b> <b>keys</b> is an {{accessibility}} {{feature of}} some {{graphical user interfaces}} to assist users who have physical disabilities or help users reduce repetitive strain injury (or a syndrome called the Emacs Pinky). It essentially serializes keystrokes instead of pressing multiple keys at a time, allowing the user to press and release a modifier key, such as Shift, Ctrl, Alt, or the Windows key, and have it remain active until any other key is pressed.|$|R
5000|$|In {{terms of}} hardware, the new {{motherboard}} is a cleaner design that drew less power and resolved audio noise issues that {{interfered with the}} Ensoniq synthesizer in the original motherboard. Over four times more RAM is built-in, with double the ROM size, and an enhanced ADB microcontroller provides native support for <b>sticky</b> <b>keys,</b> mouse emulation, and keyboard LED support (available on extended keyboards). Hardware shadowing of Text Page 2 was introduced, improving compatibility and performance with the classic Apple II video mode. The clock battery is now user-serviceable, being placed in a removable socket, and a jumper location was added to lock out the text-based control panel (mainly useful in school environments). Support for the Apple-IIe-to-IIGS upgrade was removed, and some cost-cutting measures had some chips soldered in place rather than being socketed. As the firmware only worked in this motherboard and no new firmware updates were ever issued, users commonly referred to {{this version of the}} IIGS as the [...] "ROM 3".|$|R

40|$|We {{determine}} the optimal degree of price inflation volatility when nominal wages are sticky {{and the government}} uses state-contingent inflation to finance government spending. We address this question in a well-understood Ramsey model of fiscal and monetary policy, in which the benevolent planner has access to labor income taxes, nominally risk-free debt, and money creation. Our main result is that sticky wages alone make price stability optimal {{in the face of}} shocks to the government budget, to a degree quantitatively similar as <b>sticky</b> prices alone. <b>Key</b> for our results is an equilibrium restriction between nominal price inflation and nominal wage inflation that holds trivially in a Ramsey model featuring only sticky prices. Our results thus show that when nominal wages are sticky, setting real wages {{as close as possible to}} their efficient path is a more important goal of optimal monetary policy than is financing innovations in the government budget via state-contingent inflation. A second important result is that the nominal interest rate can be used to indirectly tax the rents of monopolistic labor suppliers. Taken together, our results uncover features of Ramsey fiscal and monetary policy in the presence of a type of labor market imperfection that is widely-believed to be important.
