The forms were then pulped and recycled, and the digital copies printed onto microfilm for storage and release after 100 years. Once the data were returned to the statistics agencies it underwent further processing to ensure consistency and to impute missing values.|$|E
50|$|The {{invasion}} of the Caribbean island Grenada in 1983, ordered by President Reagan, {{was the first major}} foreign event of the administration, as well as the first major operation conducted by the military since the Vietnam War. President Reagan justified the invasion by claiming that the cooperation of the island with communist Cuba posed a threat to the United States, and stated the invasion was a response to the illegal overthrow and execution of Grenadian Prime Minister Maurice Bishop, himself a communist, by another faction of communists within his government. After the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>planning</b> for the invasion, the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) appealed to the United States, Barbados, and Jamaica, among other nations, for assistance. The US invasion was poorly done, for it took over 10,000 U.S. forces eight days of fighting, suffering nineteen fatalities and 116 injuries, fighting against several hundred lightly armed policemen and Cuban construction workers. Grenada's Governor-General, Paul Scoon, announced the resumption of the constitution and appointed a new government, and U.S. forces withdrew that December.|$|E

We present an agent-based model of cultural evolution where agents take turns at talk in conversation.

40|$|Interdisciplinary {{research}} {{is a prerequisite}} for applied progress in natural resource management. Still, most relevant studies are done by economists alone, and not in collaboration with ecologists. I discuss the ideological reasons (PAPER I), and conclude that value-based practical compromises are inevitable for the two groups to team up. Our bio economic model for optimizing production of moose (Alces alces) versus timber (PAPER II) illustrates how the compromises can be implemented. It includes management restrictions based solely on ecology and/or ethics. These strongly influenced moose demography, but had negligible economic effects. Even with very favourable conditions for moose, timber was the main source of income (> 69 %) on a typical Norwegian forest property. The moose density (at intermediate to extreme damage levels) was kept 40 - 70 % lower than if optimized without concern for tree browsing damage. Factors favouring moose were: a) a high market value of the hunt; b) lower proportion of pine in the forest; c) younger forest at <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>planning</b> period; d) lower soil fertility; and e) higher interest rate (not all relationships were linear). The model work revealed a broad need for empirical studies of moose fitness: forage interactions. To obtain large gradients in these data within the short PhD timeframe, we allocated field work spatially (twelve Norwegian ranges, 58 ° 45 ’N- 63 ° 32 ’N), rather than temporally. The field work unintentionally provided an opportunity to compare how the two most-used methods for estimating ungulate diet apply to moose summer browse (PAPER III). Fecal analyses consistently deviated from field surveys of browsed vegetation, with lower diet content of birch (Betula spp.) and correspondingly higher contents of the more preferred browse species. Although we could not quantify each causative factor, fecal analyses apparently gave the less accurate diet depiction. The method is nevertheless needed to quantify forage other than browse, which may constitute a large part of moose summer diet (PAPER IV). Several moose studies have shown that species composition of available forage may affect consumption, but none yet as comprehensively as in paper IV. Most importantly, we found that selectivity for (and not just diet content of) birch was negatively related to availability of more preferred species such as rowan (Sorbus aucuparia). Also, browse selectivity was overall less pronounced in summer than in winter (selectivity for rowan decreased, while for birch it increased when going from winter to summer). These findings will have bearings on our evaluation of the quality of summer and winter ranges, respectively. A dominance of birch compared to rowan will e. g. to a larger extent make the winter range “less good” than it will for the summer range. Our study ranges turned out to comprise two ecologically distinct moose regions, which provided a unique opportunity to look closer at the ‘range quality hypothesis’ (PAPER V). This hypothesis states that moose with more preferred forage should have better fitness due to higher yields of energy and nutrients. Contrary, though, preferred species made up only 10 % of the per capita browse availability in our high-fitness region, and 19 % in the low-fitness region. Hence, abundant preferred forage is not a requirement for Scandinavian moose to obtain and maintain high fitness. In paper V, we also quantified what determined forage availability on these ranges, of which logging was the superior factor (e. g. 6. 4 times as much birch shoot cm/m 2 in young as in older forest, depending on soil fertility). Recommendations: Three explicit research needs emerged from the thesis: 1) Determine what caused the low utilization of birch by the moose on our low-fitness ranges, apparently a fitness disadvantage; 2) Quantify the link between moose diet and moose fitness; 3) Establish long term studies of qualitative effects of moose browsing damage on timber trees. The thesis’ most important applied findings are: 1) Differential plant selectivity makes carrying capacity for moose equivocal, and cautions against extrapolating such data across ranges or seasons; 2) Logging activity ought to be integrated to the moose management; 3) On many ranges, even the less preferred forage should be included when monitoring moose browsing pressure...|$|E
