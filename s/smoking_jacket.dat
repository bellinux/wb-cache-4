5|$|In 1893 a {{chimpanzee}} {{was purchased}} from another of Wombwell's Travelling Menageries in London. The four-year-old chimpanzee, Consul, {{was dressed in}} a <b>smoking</b> <b>jacket</b> and cap and puffed on a cob pipe; he frequently accompanied James Jennison to business meetings. Consul proved to be exceptionally popular, and after his death on 24 November 1894, the Jennisons immediately obtained a replacement, ConsulII, who played a violin while riding a tricycle around the gardens, later graduating to a bicycle.|$|E
5|$|Tailors, {{attracted}} by the affluent and influential nature {{of the residents of}} Savile Row, started to open businesses in the area in the late 18th century, first in Cork Street, about 1790, then by 1803 in Savile Row itself. None of those original tailors survive today, though Henry Poole & Co, who through Edward VII's patronage, helped make the street fashionable, still have a presence in Savile Row. Poole moved the company into 32 Savile Row in 1846, following {{the death of his father}} James Poole, and the company is now at No. 15. Henry Poole is credited as creator of the dinner jacket, when he made a <b>smoking</b> <b>jacket</b> for the young Edward VII in 1860.|$|E

He was as elegant off the field as he was on; the cricket writer David Frith recorded that, [...] "to visit him in his Bellevue Hill home was to be transported into a calm 1930s world of silk <b>smoking</b> <b>jacket,</b> cigarette holder and art deco trimmings." [...] Kippax died of heart disease {{at his home in}} Bellevue Hill on 5 September 1972. The Kippax Centre in the Canberra suburb of Holt is named after him.|$|E
500|$|James Douglas {{illustrated}} his {{denunciation of}} The Well with {{a photograph of}} Radclyffe Hall in a silk <b>smoking</b> <b>jacket</b> and bow tie, holding a cigarette and monocle. She was also wearing a straight knee-length skirt, but later Sunday Express articles cropped the photo so tightly that it became difficult to tell she was not wearing trousers. Hall's style of dress was not scandalous in the 1920s; short hairstyles were common, and the combination of tailored jackets and short skirts was a recognised fashion, discussed in magazines as the [...] "severely masculine" [...] look. Some lesbians, like Hall, adopted variations of the style {{as a way of}} signalling their sexuality, but it was a code that only a few knew how to read. With the controversy over The Well of Loneliness, Hall became the public face of sexual inversion, and all women who favoured masculine fashions came under new scrutiny. Lesbian journalist Evelyn Irons– who considered Hall's style of dress [...] "rather effeminate" [...] compared to her own– said that after the publication of The Well, truck drivers would call out on the street to any woman who wore a collar and tie: [...] "Oh, you're Miss Radclyffe Hall". Some welcomed their newfound visibility: when Hall spoke at a luncheon in 1932, the audience was full of women who had imitated her look. But in a study of lesbian women in Salt Lake City in the 1920s and '30s, nearly all regretted the publication of The Well because it had drawn unwanted attention to them.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Novi list, Blažeković stated that all work at the University of Zagreb would be [...] "in harmony with the new Ustaša spirit... with which youth had been imbued for years in the decades when the university was the [...] "battleground" [...] of the Croatian struggle for liberation." [...] He {{went on to say}} that the first priority of the USS was to be the social welfare of students and the expansion of student dining rooms and residential halls. He declared that the structure of the university would change to conform with Ustaše principles – each faculty would have its own camp, consisting of a camp leader and seven adjutants responsible for military training, socio-economic welfare, contacts, sports, professional training, education and journals. Blažeković explained that for the first year of academic study, the university would employ [...] "veteran warriors" [...] as teachers who were to be replaced by fully trained [...] "younger forces" [...] who had spent the previous year preparing for their new roles. Furthermore, he stated that student volunteers would collaborate in the creation and popularization of the USS and other Ustaše organizations, which, once they had established themselves in university life, were to establish a professional, non-ideological student organization meant to incorporate all Croatian students. When asked if Serbs and Jews were to be permitted to attend universities in the NDH, Blažeković replied: [...] "In the coming academic year, the university will be swept clean of foreigners hostile to Croatians and the Ustaše movement, and in this way our endeavours at the university will be made easier." [...] Later, while dining with the wife of a Swedish diplomat, Blažeković boasted of the large number of Serbs he had killed, claiming that he placed the ears of murdered Serbs on a necklace worn over his <b>smoking</b> <b>jacket.</b>|$|E

60|$|Late one evening, billiards {{and music}} being {{over and the}} ladies gone, Shelton {{returned}} from changing to his smoking-suit, and dropped {{into one of the}} great arm-chairs that even in summer made a semicircle round the fendered hearth.

2500|$|The film {{employs a}} prologue and {{epilogue}} {{to frame the}} narrative story.

Ince and C. Gardner Sullivan. [...] As he begins reading, the film fades into the narrative story. [...] In the epilogue, the film shifts from the image of Beppo kneeling at his son's grave to Beban turning to the last page of the book, closing the book and looking thoughtful. [...] The stage curtain is then drawn closed.|$|E
2500|$|Cabbage Head (McCulloch) {{was born}} with cabbage leaves in place of hair. He also always smokes cigars and wears a red <b>smoking</b> <b>jacket</b> à la Hugh Hefner. He is {{extremely}} crude and sexist, and {{spends most of his}} time trying to pick up women for sex, using his cabbage head in an attempt to garner sympathy and, hopefully, sex ("Hey– I'm the KING of the mercy fuck!" [...] he declares in his first appearance). In one episode, he is shot in the head at a bar by a feminist crusader (also played by McCulloch) and, in a near-death experience, sees God, who said he created Cabbage Head in his image, at which point God is revealed to have a cabbage for a head himself. Later we see Cabbage Head on a Christian talk show talking about his miraculous survival, although he continues to hold sexist viewpoints, as evidenced by his promotion of a [...] "sacred wet T-shirt contest– er, I mean, baptism" [...] he was conducting. Whenever anyone objects to his odd behavior, he always insists he is being persecuted for his cabbage head. [...] "Why won't you let me forget that I have a cabbage for a head!?" ...|$|E

5000|$|While {{living in}} Hawaii, Swedberg grew up playing the ukulele. In 1992, when {{playing the role}} of a singer/songwriter for a {{television}} pilot, she began playing the instrument again. She now sings and plays the ukulele in her band, Heidi Swedberg and The Sukey Jump Band. The band released an album entitled PLAY!, in 2009 and [...] "My Cup of Tea" [...] in 2013. She has another band called the <b>Smoking</b> <b>Jackets</b> which plays ukulele festivals and night clubs. The members, Daniel Ward, Craig McClelland and John Bartlit, are multi-instrumentalists who also teach at ukulele festivals.|$|R
5000|$|In 1926, Die Dame {{introduced}} the spring fashion {{season with a}} manipulation of traditional gender roles: sketches of female models in <b>smoking</b> <b>jackets</b> and short masculine haircuts and are accompanied by male models who dress in a similar fashion. Although this representation of the New Woman was frequently condemned for reinforcing the [...] "masculinization" [...] of female gender identity, it considered sexual mobility between femininity and masculinity to be the distinguishing feature of women's fashion. In a fashion layout in 1926, the female figures retain feminine styles in their ruffled shirts and ribbon bow ties but appropriate {{at the same time}} as excess of masculine styles in their dinner suits and waistcoats which deemphasize the body.|$|R
2500|$|Of course, {{much of this}} is untrue, or a gross exaggeration. Men's formal {{clothing}} {{may have}} been less colourful {{than it was in the}} previous century, but brilliant waistcoats and cummerbunds provided a touch of color, and <b>smoking</b> <b>jackets</b> and dressing gowns were often of rich Oriental brocades. This phenomenon was the result of the growing textile manufacturing sector, developing mass production processes, and increasing attempts to market fashion to men. [...] Corsets stressed a woman's sexuality, exaggerating hips and bust by contrast with a tiny waist. Women's evening gowns bared the shoulders and the tops of the breasts. The jersey dresses of the 1880s may have covered the body, but the stretchy novel fabric fit the body like a glove.|$|R

He looked up with some surprise at Arnold's entrance.|$|E

50|$|Dinner dress blue {{jacket and}} dinner dress white jacket {{consist of a}} black waist-length jacket with gold buttons (officer) or silver buttons (petty officer first class and below). The jacket is double-breasted, but does not overlap, and is held with a clasp. (This, in {{contrast}} to double-breasted civilian evening jackets, which are worn fully open, or double-breasted <b>smoking</b> <b>jackets</b> which are worn fully overlapped and buttoned). Bullion or imitation bullion rank stripes are worn on the sleeves of the officers' blue jacket, and a rating badge and service stripes are worn by enlisted personnel. On the officers' dinner dress white jacket, hard shoulder boards are worn. A gold cummerbund is worn by officers and chief petty officers, and a black one by petty officers first class and below. Shirt studs and cuff links are gold for officers and chiefs and silver for petty officers first class and below. A hat or cap is not required with dinner dress jacket uniforms, but may be worn. For both genders, it must be worn with an outer garment, which is traditionally the boat cloak for males and cape for females. Females {{do not need to}} remove headgear indoors when wearing the tiara. The boat cloak, tiara, and cape, all being optional items, are very rarely seen.|$|R
5000|$|Taylor {{accompanied}} Epstein to the Cavern Club {{when the}} latter {{first saw the}} Beatles play, at a lunchtime performance on 9 November 1961. Recalling the moment in a later interview, Taylor described them as [...] "these four horrible young men on stage, dressed in black leather trousers, black <b>jackets,</b> <b>smoking,</b> drinking and making noise …"; he also found them [...] "charismatic and exciting" [...] and [...] "sensational".|$|R

60|$|The man in {{the next}} chair roused him by putting down his tumbler with a tap, and seating himself upon the {{cushioned}} fender. Through the mist of smoke, with shoulders hunched, elbows and knees crooked out, cigar protruding, beak-ways, below his nose, and the crimson collar of his <b>smoking</b> <b>jacket</b> buttoned close as plumage on his breast, {{he looked a little}} like a gorgeous bird.|$|E
60|$|She {{touched the}} knobs {{in the wall}} and the room was {{suddenly}} flooded with illumination. At the further end of the apartment was the great safe. Close to it, in an easy chair, his evening coat changed for a <b>smoking</b> <b>jacket,</b> with a neatly tied black tie replacing his crumpled white cravat, the Baron de Grost sat awaiting his guest. A fierce oath broke from Bernadine's lips. He turned toward the door only in time to hear the key turn. Violet tossed it lightly in the air across to her husband.|$|E
50|$|Some days after, Adrian {{is having}} dinner when a {{neighbor}} {{comes to the}} door seeking Jack's address in California. Adrian says he hasn't heard from him and shuts the door. He returns {{to the table and}} pours two glasses of wine, one for himself and one for Jack's corpse, which he has kept and sat at the table. The final scene shows Adrian's cinema, with a fairly large crowd--all men--pouring out--apparently the lean days are over. That's because the cinema is now a porn theater. Adrian, who has never throughout the film gone out in public without a suit and tie (and umbrella), leaves the building wearing a tee-shirt and Jack's black leather <b>jacket,</b> <b>smoking</b> a cigarette--all just as Jack used to do.|$|R
60|$|After {{dinner that}} night, {{when the men}} left the dining-hall, Miltoun slipped away to his den. Of all those present in the little church he had seemed most unemotional, and had been most moved. Though {{it had been so}} quiet and private a wedding, he had resented all cheap festivity {{accompanying}} the passing of his young sister. He would have had that ceremony in the little dark disused chapel at the Court; those two, and the priest alone. Here, in this half-pagan little country church smothered hastily in flowers, with the raw singing of the half-pagan choir, and all the village curiosity and homage-everything had jarred, and the stale aftermath sickened him. Changing his swallow-tail to an old <b>smoking</b> <b>jacket,</b> he went out on to the lawn. In the wide darkness he could rid himself of his exasperation.|$|E
60|$|Eliza {{opens the}} door and is seen on the lighted landing in opera cloak, {{brilliant}} evening dress, and diamonds, with fan, flowers, and all accessories. She comes to the hearth, and switches on the electric lights there. She is tired: her pallor contrasts strongly with her dark eyes and hair; and her expression is almost tragic. She takes off her cloak; puts her fan and flowers on the piano; and sits down on the bench, brooding and silent. Higgins, in evening dress, with overcoat and hat, comes in, carrying a <b>smoking</b> <b>jacket</b> which he has picked up downstairs. He takes off the hat and overcoat; throws them carelessly on the newspaper stand; disposes of his coat in the same way; puts on the smoking jacket; and throws himself wearily into the easy-chair at the hearth. Pickering, similarly attired, comes in. He also takes off his hat and overcoat, and is about to throw them on Higgins's when he hesitates.|$|E
6000|$|Which Nellie {{proceeded}} to do, and furthermore embellished the envelope by a border of chubby cherubs, dancing {{hand in hand}} around it and a sketch of No. 16 Chestnut Terrace in the corner {{in lieu of a}} stamp. Not content with this she hunted out a huge sheet of drawing paper and drew upon it an original pen-and-ink design after her own heart. A dudish cat--Miss Allen was fond of the No. 16 cat if she could be said to be fond of anything--was portrayed seated on a rocker arrayed in <b>smoking</b> <b>jacket</b> and cap with a cigar waved airily aloft in one paw while the other held out a placard bearing the legend [...] "Merry Christmas." [...] A second cat in full street costume bowed politely, hat in paw, and waved a banner inscribed with [...] "Happy New Year," [...] while faintly suggested kittens gambolled around the border. The girls laughed until they cried over it and voted it to be the best thing Nellie had yet done in original work.|$|E
60|$|So far I had not {{dared to}} look out, but now I gently parted the {{division}} of the curtains {{in front of me and}} peeped through. From the pressure of Holmes's shoulder against mine, I knew that he was sharing my observations. Right in front of us, and almost within our reach, was the broad, rounded back of Milverton. It was evident that we had entirely miscalculated his movements, that he had never been to his bedroom, but that he had been sitting up in some smoking or billiard room in the farther wing of the house, the windows of which we had not seen. His broad, grizzled head, with its shining patch of baldness, was in the immediate foreground of our vision. He was leaning far back in the red leather chair, his legs outstretched, a long, black cigar projecting at an angle from his mouth. He wore a semi-military <b>smoking</b> <b>jacket,</b> claret-coloured, with a black velvet collar. In his hand he held a long, legal document which he was reading in an indolent fashion, blowing rings of tobacco smoke from his lips as he did so. There was no promise of a speedy departure in his composed bearing and his comfortable attitude.|$|E
6000|$|The Prince, still fully attired, {{save that}} {{in place of}} his dress coat he wore a loose <b>smoking</b> <b>jacket,</b> stood at the windows of his sitting room at Devenham Castle, looking across the park. In the {{somewhat}} fitful moonlight the trees had taken to themselves grotesque shapes. Away in the distance the glimmer of the sea shone like a thin belt of quicksilver. The stable clock had struck two. The whole place seemed at rest. Only one light was gleaming from a long low building which had {{been added to the}} coach houses of recent years for a motor garage. That one light, the Prince knew, was on his account. There his chauffeur waited, untiring and sleepless, with his car always ready for that last rush to the coast, the advisability of which the Prince had considered more than once during the last twenty-four hours. The excitement of the evening, the excitement of his unwonted outburst, was still troubling him. It was not often that he had so far overstepped the bounds which his natural caution, his ever-present self-restraint, imposed upon him. He paced restlessly to and fro from the sitting room to the bedroom and back again. He had told the truth,--the bare, simple truth. He had seen the letters of fire in the sky, and he had read them to these people because of their kindness, because of a certain affection which he bore them. To them it must have sounded like a man speaking in a strange tongue. They had not understood. Perhaps, even, they would not believe in the absolute sincerity of his motives. Again he paused at the window and looked over the park to that narrow, glittering stretch of sea. Why should he not for once forget the traditions of his race, the pride which kept him there to face the end! There was still time. The cruiser which the Emperor had sent was waiting for him in Southampton Harbor. In twenty-four hours he would be in foreign waters. He thought of these things earnestly, even wistfully, and yet he knew that he could not go. Perhaps they would be glad of an opportunity of getting rid of him now that he had spoken his mind. In any case, right was on their side. The end, if it must come, was simple enough! ...|$|E
