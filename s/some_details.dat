The larger A.donovani, the type species, is known from {{hundreds}} of teeth, found in four localities that are probably 900,000 to 540,000 years old.

5|$|Bond novelist Raymond Benson {{wrote his}} {{adaptation}} of The World Is Not Enough from the film's screenplay. It was Benson's fourth Bond novel {{and followed the}} story closely, but with <b>some</b> <b>details</b> changed. For instance, Elektra sings quietly before her death and Bond still carries his Walther PPK instead of the newer P99. The novel also gave the cigar girl/assassin the name Giulietta da Vinci and retained a scene between her and Renard that was cut from the film.|$|E
5|$|Brachytarsomys mahajambaensis is an extinct rodent from northwestern Madagascar. It {{is known}} from nine {{isolated}} molars found in several sites during field work {{that started in}} 2001.

The presence of B.mahajambaensis, a rare element in the local rodent fauna, suggests that the region was previously more humid.|$|E

5|$|Tchaikovsky's {{analysis}} {{of each of}} The Five was unsparing. While {{at least some of}} his observations may seem distorted and prejudiced, he also mentions <b>some</b> <b>details</b> which ring clear and true. His diagnosis of Rimsky-Korsakov's creative crisis is very accurate. He also calls Mussorgsky the most gifted musically of the Five, though Tchaikovsky could not appreciate the forms Mussorgsky's originality took. Nonetheless, he badly underestimates Borodin's technique and gives Balakirev far less than his full due—all the more telling in light of Balakirev's help in conceiving and shaping Romeo and Juliet.|$|E
5|$|The {{contemporary}} rhetorician Libanius delivered Julian's funeral oration in 363, whose text survives. This contains <b>some</b> <b>details</b> {{about the}} battle which are missing in Ammianus, which he presumably learnt from members of Julian's entourage. But because his oration {{was intended as a}} eulogy, not a historical narrative, his account of Julian's campaign is unreliable, and Ammianus' version is to be preferred where there is a contradiction.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Caligula's reign is {{extremely}} problematic as only two sources contemporary with Caligula have survived — {{the works of}} Philo and Seneca. Philo's works, On the Embassy to Gaius and Flaccus, give <b>some</b> <b>details</b> on Caligula's early reign, but mostly focus on events surrounding the Jewish population in Judea and Egypt with whom he sympathizes. Seneca's various works give mostly scattered anecdotes on Caligula's personality. Seneca was almost put to death by Caligula in AD 39 likely due to his associations with conspirators.|$|E

5|$|There {{are some}} criticisms of van Kinsbergen's photographs. He missed <b>some</b> <b>details</b> and {{sometimes}} his series was unbalanced.

The printing quality, however, is beyond question and he had success showing the beauty of classical Javanese arts. His photographs were shown to the public both in the 1873 International Exhibition in Vienna and the 1878 World Exhibition in Paris. His works can be seen in several places, including the National Museum in Amsterdam.|$|E

5|$|By 1683 the College {{part of the}} {{structure}} was finished. The new building was built out of plain bricks of three storeys, with basement and attic levels in addition. The College consists of an extensive range of quadrangular buildings. Apart from the hall, a porter's lodge and a public office, {{the rest of the}} building was given over to the heralds as accommodation. To the east and south sides three terraced houses were constructed for leases, their façade in keeping with the original design. In 1699 the hall, which for some time had been used as a library, was transformed into the Earl Marshal's Court or the Court of Chivalry; it remains so to this day. In 1776 some stylistic changes were made to the exterior of the building and <b>some</b> <b>details,</b> such as pediments and cornices were removed, transforming the building to the then popular but austere Neo-Classical style.|$|E

5|$|Germany's {{refusal to}} give the Dutch access to plans {{detailing}} {{the design of the}} Scharnhorsts below the waterline was a major problem. Inexperienced in designing an underwater protection scheme for a ship of this size, the Dutch were forced to turn to Italy for assistance, which allowed a delegation of engineers and naval officers to enter the country in February 1940. Although the Dutch delegation was barred from viewing technical drawings or the battleship , then under construction, possibly to ensure that the details of their Pugliese system remained a secret, they were allowed to visit , toured several shipyards, interviewed the Chief Constructor of the Italian Navy, and received additional information on the Scharnhorsts, the ItaliansGermany's allyknowing <b>some</b> <b>details</b> of the ships.|$|E
5|$|Grossman and Schafer brainstormed {{regularly}} to devise the time travel puzzles, and collaborated {{with members of}} the development team as well as other LucasArts employees. They would identify puzzle problems and work towards a solution similar to how the game plays. Most issues were addressed prior to programming, but <b>some</b> <b>details</b> were left unfinished to work on later. The staff conceived puzzles involving the U.S.'s early history based on their memory of their compulsory education, and using the more legendary aspects of history, such as George Washington cutting down a cherry tree to appeal to international audiences. To complete the elements, Grossman researched the period to maintain historical accuracy, visiting libraries and contacting reference librarians. The studio, however, took creative license towards facts to fit them into the game's design.|$|E
