40|$|The {{elaboration}} of <b>self-questions</b> consists of achieving before, {{during and after}} studying some very significant questions about the contents {{that have to be}} learnt. The {{elaboration of}} <b>self-questions</b> as a learning-strategy can be taught integrated in the curriculum of eight class-rooms or working-sessions. Thus it has been proved on a search made with 64 students from High School of three different class-rooms: experimental room, informed room (students who received information about the benefits of using the strategy), and control room (those students that have received none intervention). The experimental evidence shows significant improvement on the informed students who were in training on self-questioning respect to the other two groups (control and informed class-rooms). The main evidences are about dependent variables: Objective Efficiency, Self-question Quality, and Detected Use of learning strategies. The investigation suggests the search of modulator variables from the efficiency of the learning program...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the comparative efficacy of two instructional approaches—didactic teaching and self-instructional training—in teaching average and poor readers a comprehension question-answering strategy. Forty-five average students and 45 poor readers from Grades 5 and 6 participated. These 38 girls and 52 boys were equally and {{randomly assigned to one}} of three treatment conditions: didactic teaching of the strategy, self-instruction, or control (no training). Students in the first two treatment conditions learned a mnemonic strategy ("Here, " "Hidden, " and "in my Head") to indicate question-answer relationships that are text explicit, text implicit, or script implicit, respectively. Essentially, the 3 H mnemonic cued students to use appropriate text and/or knowledge-base information in answering comprehension test questions. In addition, students in the self-instruction group learned three <b>self-questions</b> to guide their use of the 3 H strategy. Specifically, the <b>self-questions</b> focused students ' attention on the task, provided a basis for decision making concerning the categorization of compre-hension test questions, and reminded students to check their answers. The results indicated that both didactic teaching and self-instructional training of the strategy effected significant improvements in students ' reading comprehension performance. However, self-instructiona...|$|E

Therefore mental models are needed which facilitate the re-use of previous regulation processes.

Those who study content online may require support to use effective methods that transform passive, less-engaged learning into active comprehension and purposeful application. This study compared two learning tactics: self-questioning and self-explanation {{that have not}} been compared in prior research. Health professionals and students across Canada studied a chapter in the Canadian Fundamentals of Fetal Health Surveillance (FHS) Self-Learning Online Manual, presented on an online learning management system. Participants used nStudy learning software to open note templates and type in either self-explanations or choose one among several question stems then fill in blank space(s) to create a question. Participants who created self-explanations performed better on the achievement posttest than those who generated <b>self-questions.</b> Further analyses disaggregated posttest items into intentional learning (relating to information in the text about which participants were prompted to generate an annotation) and incidental learning (relating to information in the text not directly prompted for annotation). Within the self-explanation condition, there was no statistically detectable difference in recall on intentional (prompted) content compared to incidental (non-prompted) content. In the self-questioning condition, incidental content was recalled similarly to the self-explanation group. However, there was a marked and statistically detectable decrease in recall of content about which participants were prompted to generate <b>self-questions.</b> Possible reasons for this effect based on past research and participant comments are discussed along with limitations of the study and opportunities for further research...|$|E

40|$|Laurent Versini : The {{novel in}} 1778. The novel was flourishing, in {{quantity}} at least, but having become polymorphous, {{it was in}} danger of losing its character : it replaced the theatre, took over morality, went back to its poetical origins in the trou badour genre and the pastoral. Voltaire's philosophical story declined to become MarmontaTs and Baculard's moral story, and Rousseau's ethics, moralising sermons The novel of analysis and passionate <b>self-questionning</b> was replaced by concern for society and everyday life. The only dominating character is Rétifs strange genius; but the novel has become a serious object of critical study, and it is adult enough to be questioned from within the text itself, as in Jacques le Fataliste.

60|$|Annie {{went into}} her father's study, where she had lit {{the fire in the}} Franklin-stove on her way to breakfast. It had come on to rain during the night, after the fine {{yesterday}} which Mrs. Gerrish had denounced to its face as a weather-breeder. At first it rained silently, stealthily; but toward morning Annie heard the wind rising, and when she looked out of her window after daylight she found a fierce north-easterly storm drenching and chilling the landscape. Now across the flattened and tangled grass of the lawn the elms were writhing in the gale, and swinging their long lean boughs to and fro; from another window she saw the cuffed and hustled maples ruffling their stiff masses of foliage, and shuddering in the storm. She turned away, with a sigh of the luxurious melancholy which a northeaster inspires in people safely sheltered from it, and sat down before her fire. She recalled the three women who had visited her the day before, in the better-remembered figures of their childhood and young girlhood; and their present character did not seem a broken promise. Nothing was really disappointed in it but the animal joy, the hopeful riot of their young blood, which must fade and die with the happiest fate. She perceived that what they had come to was not unjust to what they had been; and as our own fate always appears to us unaccomplished, a thing for the distant future to fulfil, she began to ask herself what was to be the natural sequence of such a temperament, such mental and moral traits, as hers. Had her life been so noble in anything but vague aspirations that she could ever reasonably expect the destiny of grand usefulness which she had always unreasonably expected? The question came home to her with such pain, in the light of what her old playmates had become, that she suddenly ceased to enjoy the misery of the storm out-of-doors, or the purring content of the fire on the hearth of the stove at her feet; the book she had taken down to read fell unopened into her lap, and she gave herself up to a half-hour of such piercing <b>self-question</b> as only a high-minded woman can endure when the flattering promises of youth have grown vague and few.|$|R
60|$|Her first {{intention}} {{had been to}} go back to her own town after her graduation, and begin the practice of her profession among those who had always known her, and whose scrutiny and criticism would be hardest to bear, and therefore, as she fancied, the most useful to her in the formation of character. But afterwards she relinquished her purpose in favor of a design which she thought would be more useful to others: she planned going to one of the great factory towns, and beginning practice there, in company with an older physician, among the children of the operatives. Pending the completion of this arrangement, which was waiting upon the decision of the other lady, she had come to Jocelyn's with her mother, and with Mrs. Maynard, who had arrived from the West, aimlessly sick and unfriended, just as they were about leaving home. There was no resource but to invite her with them, and Dr. Breen was finding her first patient in this unexpected guest. She did not wholly regret the accident; this, too, was useful work, though not that she would have chosen; but her mother, after a fortnight, openly repined, and could not mention Mrs. Maynard without some rebellious murmur. She was an old lady, who had once kept a very vigilant conscience for herself; but after making her life unhappy with it for some threescore years, she now applied it entirely to the exasperation and condemnation of others. She especially devoted it to fretting a New England girl's naturally morbid sense of duty in her daughter, and keeping it in the irritation of perpetual <b>self-question.</b> She had never actively opposed her studying medicine; that ambition had harmonized very well with certain radical tendencies of her own, and it was at least not marriage, which she had found tolerable only in its modified form of widowhood; but at every step after the decisive step was taken she was beset with misgivings lest Grace was not fully alive to the grave responsibilities of her office, which she accumulated upon the girl in proportion as she flung off all responsibilities of her own. She was doubtless deceived by that show of calm which sometimes deceived Grace herself, who, in tutoring her soul to bear what it had to bear, mistook her tense effort for spiritual repose, and scarcely realized through her tingling nerves the strain she was undergoing. In spite of the bitter experience of her life, she was still very ardent in her hopes of usefulness, very scornful of distress or discomfort to herself, and a little inclined to exact the heroism she was ready to show. She had a child's severe morality, and she had hardly learned to understand that there is much evil in the world that does not characterize the perpetrators: she held herself as strictly to account for every word and deed as she held others, and she had an almost passionate desire to meet the consequence of her errors; till that was felt, an intolerable doom hung over her. She tried not to be impulsive; that was criminal in one of her calling; and she struggled for patience with an endeavor that was largely successful.|$|R
40|$|Various {{cognitive}} and computational models {{have addressed the}} use of previous experience to understand a new domain. In particular, research in case-based reasoning has explored the ideas of retrieving and adapting previous experience {{in the form of}} cases. If the cases take the form of plans, the process is referred to as case-based planning. We have developed a computational model of Exploratory Discovery which integrates case-based reasoning and case-based planning. Motivated by results from cognitive science, we incorporated in this model the features of explo-ration and self-questioning to improve the case-based learning process. This paper will focus on the index vocabulary needed to accomplish the interaction between the case-based generation of <b>self-questions</b> and the case-based experimentation process. The interaction depends on questions asked, answers given, and previously performed experiments. Interaction is therefore situated. 1. Continuous Case-Based Reasoning When people are exposed to an unfamiliar task such as understanding a new device, they are sometimes reminded of previous experience in other domains. Cognitive models of reminding have evolved in an attempt to explain this phenomenon (e. g., Ross 1989). The concept of re-use of previous experience has been exploited in the paradigm of case-based reasoning where previ...|$|E
40|$|Although {{there has}} been an {{increased}} interest in the use of electronic portfolios in higher education over the last five years, relatively {{little is known about the}} potential of such tools to support the development of higher order abilities for students, such as reflection, in a structured way that is suitable for assessment. This paper reports the findings from a small-scale research which sets out to compare the outcomes of reflective assignments in two cohorts of participants in a Postgraduate Certificate in Professional Practice in Higher Education in the UK. Participants in the programme were asked to submit reflective accounts using an e-portfolio system as part of their formal assessment. One cohort completed the assessment using some generic guidelines of how to reflect and construct an e-portfolio page without a given template or structure, whereas another cohort was given a specific template with clear assessment criteria to gauge the assembly of their reflections. The authors, who are also tutors in the programme, analysed the submitted reflections following open coding procedures. The analysis found a tendency for the reflection in the first cohort to be merely descriptive without progressing to speculating objectively about answers to relevant analytical questions about the process involved in the ability under scrutiny. In contrast the assignments of cohort two were found to be more insightful in terms of assimilating random bits of materials, thoughts and <b>self-questions</b> into complete reflective accounts. These findings bring some evidence to support and indeed promote a more structured approach to reflective practice, which can be further enhanced through a carefully created e-portfolio template and associated assessment criteria. 4 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this case study was to provide benefit to preservice and inservice science teachers, who have an {{interest}} in applying scientific argumentation in their high school chemistry instructions, by investigating role of question prompts and an interactive simulation supporting the development of scientific argumentation. In particular, the study examined the quality of students’ arguments changing over time in scientific argumentation when they constructed and defended their arguments using the “Gas Properties” computer simulation. For this purpose, forty-seven 11 th grade students from four classes first worked in pairs and then, all the pairs returned the classroom for discussion. One pair was selected as a focal group by their chemistry teachers within each class resulting in a total of four focal groups. The chemistry teachers posed the driving question of Part I to familiarize students with scientific argumentation while exploring the effect of gravity on the behavior of air molecules in space. Then, the teachers challenged the students with the driving question of Part II to help students construct and defend more elaborate scientific arguments while comparing the behaviors of air and Helium molecules in space. I examined what type of arguments participants found convincing and also searched which conditions (i. e. challenged by the driving question, counter-arguments, peer question or <b>self-questions,</b> or prompted by representation of investigation, teacher questions, or similar arguments) helped students to improve their arguments in scientific argumentation. The results depicted that in pair discussions, argumentation was a way of participants’ collectively supporting a scientific claim based on evidence from the interactive simulation and trying to agree on conclusions drawn from this evidence. Though, only two focal groups generated the highest quality of arguments with the waxing and waning amount of consensus over time from Part I to Part II. On the other hand, in classroom discussions focal groups tried to win their opponents over to their points of view and to weaken opposing views with making their evidence visible on the interactive simulation, which led four focal groups to produce the highest quality of arguments from Part I to Part II...|$|E
6000|$|He lived {{twenty-five years}} after that <b>self-question</b> at sixty, and after eighty he {{continued}} to prove that threescore was not the limit of a man's intellectual activity or literary charm. During all that time the work he did in mere quantity was the work that {{a man in the}} prime of life might well have been vain of doing, and it was of a quality not less surprising. If I asked him with any sort of fair notice I could rely upon him always for something for the January number, and throughout the year I could count upon him for those occasional pieces in which he so easily excelled all former writers of occasional verse, and which he liked to keep from the newspapers for the magazine. He had a pride in his promptness with copy, and you could always trust his promise. The printer's toe never galled the author's kibe in his case; he wished to have an early proof, which he corrected fastidiously, but not overmuch, and he did not keep it long. He had really done all his work in the manuscript, which came print-perfect and beautifully clear from his pen, in that flowing, graceful hand which to the last kept a suggestion of the pleasure he must have had in it. Like all wise contributors, he was not only patient, but very glad of all the queries and challenges that proof- reader and editor could accumulate on the margin of his proofs, and when they were both altogether wrong he was still grateful. In one of his poems there was some Latin-Quarter French, which our collective purism questioned, and I remember how tender of us he was in maintaining that in his Parisian time, at least, some ladies beyond the Seine said [...] "Eh, b'en," [...] instead of [...] "Eh, bien." [...] He knew that we must be {{always on the lookout for}} such little matters, and he would not wound our ignorance. I do not think any one enjoyed praise more than he. Of course he would not provoke it, but if it came of itself, he would not deny himself the pleasure, as long as a relish of it remained. He used humorously to recognize his delight in it, and to say of the lecture audiences which in earlier times hesitated applause, [...] "Why don't they give me three times three? I can stand it!" [...] He himself gave in the generous fulness he desired. He did not praise foolishly or dishonestly, though he would spare an open dislike; but when a thing pleased him he knew how to say so cordially and skilfully, so that it might help as well as delight. I suppose no great author has tried more sincerely and faithfully to befriend the beginner than he; and from time to time he would commend something to me that he thought worth looking at, but never insistently. In certain cases, where he had simply to ease a burden, from his own to the editorial shoulders, he would ask that the aspirant might be delicately treated. There might be personal reasons for this, but usually his kindness of heart moved him. His tastes had their geographical limit, but his sympathies were boundless, and the hopeless creature for whom he interceded was oftener remote from Boston and New England than otherwise.|$|R
40|$|This study {{contributes}} {{to the development of}} a theological phenomenology of vocation. In so doing, it posits that the distressing condition of existential unrest can be a foundational motivation for the vocational search and argues that the discovery of one 2 ̆ 7 s vocation, which necessarily entails an engagement with existential mystery, is served by attentiveness to what is termed the 2 ̆ 7 pneumo-somatic 2 ̆ 7 data of embodied consciousness. Hence, the study does not canvass the broad range of phenomena that would contribute to a comprehensive phenomenology of vocation. Rather, it seeks to highlight an aspect frequently overlooked in the vocational search, namely the value of attentiveness to one 2 ̆ 7 s experience of the body in the context of prayerful engagement with the mystery of God. The questions addressed by the study arose from my experience of working at the interface of psychology and spirituality. People who have been subjected to extreme suffering frequently find that their usual modes of self-experience and of relating to the world have been stripped away. They experience agitation and restlessness. They are exposed to a mysterious and disturbing void at the core of their being and a profound existential self-question arises from that experience. Existential concerns have been addressed throughout the ages, engaging as they do both an interior experience of mystery and an ensuing self-question. Hans Urs von Balthasar explores these dynamics and articulates the self-question as 2 ̆ 7 Who am I? 2 ̆ 7 Another to address these issues is Bernard Lonergan who asks what it is to 2 ̆ 7 be oneself. 2 ̆ 7 For Balthasar the question is answered only by the discovery of one 2 ̆ 7 s God-given vocation and mission. For Lonergan the question is answered by the authentic exercise of one 2 ̆ 7 s capacity for self-transcendence. Ultimately, I suggest, both approaches are complementary.;Both Balthasar and Lonergan envisage the possibility of lives lived in obedient attentiveness to the mystery of God 2 ̆ 7 s grace. For Balthasar that attentiveness will result in alertness to the vocational and missionary calling with which God uniquely addresses each person. For Lonergan such attentiveness will result in being in love with God and in a life oriented ultimately towards the mystery of God 2 ̆ 7 s love for us and our calling to serve in love. Balthasar and Lonergan complement one another in showing the full range of dynamics that constitute the human person. In relationship with God and with others, and through the authentic exercise of self-transcending intentionality, human beings not only find fulfilment but live lives that reveal the glory of God. Taken together, the ways in which Balthasar and Lonergan address these foundational human questions provide a comprehensive philosophical and theological underpinning for the consideration of vocation. In this study, I also draw on the work of the Lonergan scholar, Robert Doran, to help identify the dynamics of interiority that contribute to being adequately attentive to the manifestation of mystery in human consciousness. Doran 2 ̆ 7 s notion of psychic conversion, and in particular his expansion of that conversion in an organic direction, serve my concerns. Doran provides an explanation for the tranquillity and rest that the human person seeks. For Doran such rest arises through attunement to God wherein there is no longer an object to which intentionality is directed. There is instead a nonintentional abandonment to the love of God, an experience that can overwhelm us by its impact upon our consciousness. I suggest that particular spiritual phenomena manifest at these times, such as the gifts of the Holy Spirit and the spiritual senses.;The exercise of the gift of wisdom as well as an alert cooperation with the experience of the spiritual senses enables the development of a connatural attunement to God. I explore how it is that spiritual senses become evident in human consciousness and suggest that theological reflection needs to attend to a highly refined form of pneumo-somatic data that is available for attentive receptivity. Non-judgemental, accepting acknowledgement of the data of embodied consciousness is particularly important in the context of being exposed through faith to the new horizons of God 2 ̆ 7 s love for us. Such love can upset our previous equanimity in its challenge to encompass new demands and, in the process, can generate anxiety and dread. It can have a decentring effect. I reflect on postmodern thinking which gives significant attention to the dynamic of decentring, as well as to the body and its engagement with mystery. Throughout the study, I emphasise the value of attentiveness to the felt-sense of embodied consciousness as a means for engagement with mystery. Through such attentiveness, human beings can learn to be attuned to God and to align themselves with God 2 ̆ 7 s will for them in daily decision-making. People will thereby be helped to find the unique way in which God wishes them to love God and lovingly to serve others. In the ensuing discovery of their vocation, they find an answer to their existential <b>self-questions...</b>|$|E
