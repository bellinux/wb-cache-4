40|$|Informal trilogues {{have become}} a {{standard}} operating procedure in the European Union’s ordinary legislative procedure. Generally, their occurrence {{is seen as a}} trade-off in which speed is prioritized over inclusive decision making. Hence, a relationship is assumed between intra-institutional processes and inter-institutional interactions. This article therefore tries to explain the number of informal trilogues in first readings. The contribution of this analysis is twofold. First, it shows that intra-institutional political processes such as contestation of the rapporteur’s preferences, politicization inside the Council and the number of <b>shadow</b> <b>rapporteurs</b> matter. Second, {{it for the first time}} measures the number of informal trilogues directly for the full population of post-Lisbon legislative files...|$|R
40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{determinants}} of assignments to European Parliament negotiating teams comprising both <b>rapporteurs</b> and <b>shadow</b> <b>rapporteurs.</b> We re-examine the argument that under-representation of MEPs (Members of the European Parliament) from new Member States on these key posts after enlargement might {{have been due to}} a 'learning phase'. We find that MEPs from newer Member States remain considerably less likely to act as rapporteurs during the second term after enlargement (2009 – 14). Most importantly, this trend also holds for shadow rapporteurships under the co-decision procedure, which is when they matter most. This structural under-representation entails important implications for European integration, most importantly that MEPs from newer Member States are less able to influence legislation. We suggest that the patterns we find could be the result of reduced willingness, a more limited skill set, or a structural disadvantage of MEPs from the accession states in the report allocation process...|$|R

40|$|The {{processing}} {{of the advanced}} therapies regulation {{is of particular interest}} to scholars of the European Union's (EU) legislative process and students of the European Parliament (EP) because it provides a case study which throws light upon assumptions commonly made {{about the role of the}} EP's ‘relais actors’, the promotion of consensus-building within and between parliamentary committees, and the development of intraorganizational rules in response to early agreements in the co-decision procedure. An examination of the EP's {{processing of}} the advanced therapies dossier provides an ‘unusual’ but vivid illustration of how the identification of committee rapporteurs as the most important parliamentary ‘relais actors’ fails to capture the increasingly important roles performed by <b>shadow</b> <b>rapporteurs.</b> Significantly, the ‘unusual’ occurrences associated with the processing of the advanced therapies regulation came at a crucial juncture in the reconsideration of the EP's intraorganizational rules in relation to early agreements and the subsequent adoption of new Rules of Procedure in 2009...|$|R
