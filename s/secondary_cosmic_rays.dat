50|$|Radiation {{is often}} {{categorized}} as either ionizing or non-ionizing {{depending on the}} energy of the radiated particles. Ionizing radiation carries more than 10 eV, which is enough to ionize atoms and molecules, and break chemical bonds. This is an important distinction due to the large difference in harmfulness to living organisms. A common source of ionizing radiation is radioactive materials that emit α, β, or γ radiation, consisting of helium nuclei, electrons or positrons, and photons, respectively. Other sources include X-rays from medical radiography examinations and muons, mesons, positrons, neutrons and other particles that constitute the <b>secondary</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays</b> that are produced after primary cosmic rays interact with Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
5000|$|When a high-energy {{particle}} {{from outer}} space ("primary" [...] cosmic ray) encounters Earth, its first interaction is usually with an air molecule {{at an altitude of}} 30 km or so. This encounter causes the air molecule to split into smaller pieces, each having high energy. The smaller pieces are called [...] "secondary" [...] cosmic rays, and they in turn hit other air molecules resulting in more <b>secondary</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays.</b> The process continues and is termed an [...] "atmospheric cascade". If the primary cosmic ray that started the cascade has energy over 500 MeV, some of its secondary byproducts (including neutrons) will reach ground level where they can be detected by neutron monitors.|$|E
50|$|Typical {{ionizing}} {{subatomic particles}} from radioactivity include alpha particles, beta particles and neutrons. Almost all products of radioactive decay are ionizing because {{the energy of}} radioactive decay is typically far higher than that required to ionize. Other subatomic ionizing particles which occur naturally are muons, mesons, positrons, and other particles that constitute the <b>secondary</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays</b> that are produced after primary cosmic rays interact with Earth's atmosphere. Cosmic rays are generated by stars and certain celestial events such as supernova explosions. Cosmic rays may also produce radioisotopes on Earth (for example, carbon-14), which in turn decay and produce ionizing radiation. Cosmic rays and the decay of radioactive isotopes are the primary sources of natural ionizing radiation on Earth referred to as background radiation. Ionizing radiation can also be generated artificially using X-ray tubes, particle accelerators, and any of the various methods that produce radioisotopes artificially.|$|E
40|$|The {{low-energy}} antiproton flux {{measurement of}} Buffinton et al. (1981) {{is more than}} an order of magnitude higher than can be explained by interstellar production. It has been suggested that the excess antiprotons may be created by supernovae in very dense regions of ISM. These sources would provide the additional target material necessary to produce the excess <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> antiprotons; in addition, adiabatic energy losses due to supernova expansion will increase the flux of low-energy antiprotons.

40|$|The {{observation}} (Leventhal et al, 1978) of positron {{annihilation radiation}} at 0. 511 MeV {{from the direction}} of the Galactic Center is reexamined, suggesting the possibility of a primary positron component of the <b>cosmic</b> <b>rays.</b> The observed 0. 511 MeV emission requires a positron production rate nearly two orders of magnitude greater than the production rate of <b>secondary</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> positrons from pion decay produced in <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> interactions.

If only about 1 % of these positrons were accelerated along with the <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> nucleons and electrons to energies not less than 100 MeV, it is believed that these primary positrons would be comparable in intensity to those secondary positrons resulting from pion decay.

In this dissertation work, a Geant 4 based ECRS simulation was designed and developed to study <b>secondary</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>ray</b> particle showers in {{the full range of}} Earth 2 ̆ 7 s atmosphere. A proper atmospheric air density and geomagnetic field are implemented in order to correctly simulate the charged particles interactions in the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s atmosphere. The initial simulation was done for the Atlanta (33. 460 N, 84. 250 W) region. Four different types of primary proton energies (109, 1010, 1011 and 1012 eV) were considered to determine the secondary particle distribution at the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s surface. The geomagnetic field and atmospheric air density have considerable effects on the muon particle distribution at the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s surface. The muon charge ratio at the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s surface was studied with ECRS simulation for two different geomagnetic locations: Atlanta, Georgia, USA and Lynn Lake, Manitoba, Canada. The simulation results are shown in excellent agreement with the data from NMSU-WIZARD/CAPRICE and BESS experiments at Lynn Lake. At low momentum, ground level muon charge ratios show latitude dependent geomagnetic effects for both Atlanta and Lynn Lake from the simulation. The simulated charge ratio is 1. 20 ± 0. 05 (without geomagnetic field), 1. 12 ± 0. 05 (with geomagnetic field) for Atlanta and 1. 22 ± 0. 04 (with geomagnetic field) for Lynn Lake.
