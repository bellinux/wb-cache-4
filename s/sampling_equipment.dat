5|$|The {{design of}} the RP-77D made {{extensive}} use of glass-polyester plastic materials. The drone was launched using a rocket-assisted take-off system consisting of four Loki rockets, and was fitted with a radio control apparatus that, {{with the assistance of}} radar tracking, allowed the drone to be operated at a considerable distance from its launching point. In addition to equipment typically carried by target drones, the RP-77D could be equipped with reconnaissance or meteorological sensors, or with air <b>sampling</b> <b>equipment.</b> The RP-77D utilised the RPTA tracking system, developed by Radioplane, using audio frequency tones for control. Tip tanks allowed for carriage of additional fuel to extend the aircraft's range, and recovery {{at the end of the}} flight was by parachute.|$|E

25|$|When the bandlimit is {{too high}} (or there is no bandlimit), the {{reconstruction}} exhibits imperfections known as aliasing. Modern statements of the theorem are sometimes careful to explicitly state that x(t) must contain no sinusoidal component at exactly frequency B, or that B must be strictly less than ½ the sample rate. The two thresholds, 2B and fs/2 are respectively called the Nyquist rate and Nyquist frequency. And respectively, they are attributes of x(t) and of the <b>sampling</b> <b>equipment.</b> The condition described by these inequalities is called the Nyquist criterion, or sometimes the Raabe condition. The theorem is also applicable to functions of other domains, such as space, {{in the case of}} a digitized image. The only change, in the case of other domains, is the units of measure applied to t, fs, and B.|$|E
25|$|However, in a newer {{history by}} a retired Big Safari {{commander}} published in 2014, {{some of the}} earlier account is refuted as erroneous. The Pee Wee III aircraft arrived in Pakistan in March 1964, well before the Chinese nuclear tests began, not for monitoring the tests since the aircraft were not yet equipped with the <b>sampling</b> <b>equipment,</b> camera, or sensors of the standard RB-57Fs, but to collect telemetry from Soviet missile test ranges, particularly Kapustin Yar. The aircraft were both flown and maintained {{by members of the}} Pakistan Air Force, not the U.S. Air Force, a condition mandated by the Pakistanis. The RB-57F prototypes, with the required capability of being a type that PAF airmen could fly, had been purpose-built with the telemetry mission as its goal, and the modification for carrying a two-ton payload in the bomb bay had been made by General Dynamics as part of its development, not by the PAF. From April to October 1965 the two RB-57s each underwent an annual three-month depot maintenance recycle at the General Dynamics plant in Fort Worth required by Big Safari rules, which was where Pee Wee III #2 was when the air war began on 1 September 1965.|$|E

2500|$|Departing Sydney on 16 July {{using only}} one engine to {{conserve}} fuel, Marion headed through the Strait of Belle Isle and began her oceanographic survey mission. Initially, only Smith and his executive officer, Lieutenant Noble Ricketts, had {{the knowledge of}} how to sample the Arctic waters for temperature and salinity but they trained additional men to handle the instruments used for the survey. At each stop the ship's position was noted and a sounding was made while the temperature and salinity samples were collected. With [...] of sample wire in the water, both winches that handled the <b>sampling</b> <b>equipment</b> failed on 27 July. The crew managed to retrieve the wire in the dark in three hours by using the anchor windlass to heave the line in. In the meantime, one failed winch was repaired using parts scavenged from a spare and the line was spooled back onto the winch. The repair evolution was completed by morning with one winch operational. By July 31, Danish officials in Greenland had radioed permission for Marion to put into Godthaab for repairs to the other winch and the crew worked through the day to remove the two ton winch to shore for repair and replace it on the deckhouse. Marion departed Godthaab that evening with repairs completed.|$|E
