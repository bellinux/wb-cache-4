40|$|Most of the Great Basin <b>sediment-hosted</b> gold {{deposits}} {{are located}} along well defined, northwest-striking trends. Trends coincide with faults, intrusive rocks and magnetic anomalies. Sedimentary host rocks are siltstone, sandstone, conglomerate, argillic, interbedded chert and shales. Silty bedded silty dolomites, limestone and carbonaceous shales {{are the most}} favourable hosts. High, and locally, low-angle faults are very important structural features related {{to the formation of}} the ore bodies. High-angle faults are conduits of hydrothermal fluids which react, shatter and prepare the favourable host rock. Decalcification, silicification, and argillization are the most common hydrothermal alteration types. Jasperoid (intense silica replacement) is a significant characteristic; not all of these deposits are gold-bearing. Most deposits contain both oxidized and unoxidized ore. Fine grained disseminated pyrite, arsenian pyrite, and carbonaceous material are the most common hosts for gold in many deposits. These deposits are also characterized by high Au/Ag ratios, notable absence of base metal and geochemical associations of Au, As, Sb, Hg, Ba and TI. Recently numerous <b>sediment-hosted</b> gold deposits have been recognized in different regions of the world. They vary in their size, grades, textwe, host rock lithology, degrees of structural control and chemical characteristics. However, they have many common features which are very similar to the general characteristics of <b>sediment-hosted</b> gold deposits in the Great Basin, U. S. A. Besides these similarities, several unusual features are recorded in some newly discovered deposits elsewhere, such as predominant fault controlled paleokarst related mineralization and the lack of two very common trace elements (Hg, TI) in Lobongan/Alason, Indonesia; and Early Proterozoic age metamorphosed host rocks and lack of Sb in Maoling, China. The discovery of the deep ores in the Post-Betze and Rabbit Canyon, Nevada, proposed <b>sediment-hosted</b> Au emplacement at deeper level (4 ± 2 km; Kuehn & Rose, 1995) combined with a lack of field evidence for paleowater table and paleosurface features has ruled out a shallow epithermal origin.

40|$|We report S isotopic {{compositions}} of sulfides {{of various}} paragenetic {{stages in the}} giant Sukhoi Log <b>sediment-hosted</b> orogenic Au deposit. The overall mean value and the significant variability in early pyrite indicates that the sulfur was from the reduction of seawater sulfate. The later generations of sulfide have δ 34 S values in successively smaller ranges, coincident with the mode that is around the median value of the whole data set. Together with textural evidence, sulfide trace element data, and gold occurrence, the data demonstrate that metamorphism has gradually homogenized the early sulfur, accompanied by the segregation of quartz {{and the release of}} Au from the lattice of early pyrite and its re-precipitation as inclusions in later pyrite. The S isotopic compositions of sulfides in Sukhoi Log, and many other major orogenic Au deposits hosted in sedimentary rocks of various ages, show a pattern generally parallel to the seawater sulfate curve through geologic time, indicating that the sulfur in most <b>sediment-hosted</b> orogenic Au deposits was probably also originally from the reduction of seawater sulfate.

The combination of geochemical and molecular data from Eel River Basin and Hydrate Ridge suggested that some nodules formed in situ and captured the local <b>sediment-hosted</b> microbial community, while other nodules may have been translocated or may represent a record of conditions prior to the contemporary environment.

We present compositional in situ data on sphalerite from submarine volcanic-hosted massive sulfide (VHMS) ores of hydrothermal vents from different plate tectonic settings and with variable host-rock compositions. Sphalerite from <b>sediment-hosted</b> vents has systematically higher S contents and Fe/Zn ratios than those of the sediment-starved vents, reflecting an influence of fS 2 and fO 2 on Fe partitioning between fluid and sphalerite.

40|$|<b>Sediment-hosted</b> {{stratiform}} copper deposits comprise disseminated to veinlet Cu and Cu-Fe sulfides in siliciclastic or dolomitic sedimentary rocks. <b>Sediment-hosted</b> stratiform copper deposits {{are extremely}} common though economically significant deposits are rare. They account for approximately 23 {{percent of the}} world's Cu production and known reserves {{in addition to being}} significant sources of Co and Ag. Three sedimentary basins (the Paleoproterozoic Kodaro-Udokan in Siberia, the Neoproterozoic Katangan in central Africa, and the Permian basin of central Europe) contain supergiant (> 24 million metric tons (Mt) contained Cu) deposits. <b>Sediment-hosted</b> stratiform copper deposits are the products of evolving basin-scale fluid-flow systems that include source(s) of metal and S, source(s) of metal- and S-transporting fluids, the transport paths of these fluids, a thermal and/or hydraulic pump to collect and drive the fluids, and the chemical and physical processes which result in precipitation of the sulfides. Metal sources are undoubtedly red-bed sedimentary rocks containing Fe oxyhydroxides capable of weakly binding metals. Sulfur may be derived from marine or lacustrine evaporites, reduced seawater, or hydrogen sulfide-bearing petroleum. Metals appear to have been transported at low to moderate temperatures in moderately to highly saline aqueous fluids, with the temperature of the fluid largely dependent on the time of fluid migration in the basin's burial history. These basinal fluids were focused to potential metal precipitation sites by thinning of the red-bed sequence at basin margins, by faults, by differentially permeable sedimentary units, by paleotopography within the basin, or along the margins of salt diapirs. Fluid movement produced widespread, basin-scale alteration that has commonly been overlooked but can form an important exploration guide. Sulfide precipitation occurred due to reduction, typically caused by reaction with carbonaceous rocks or petroleum. The amount of sulfides present at any deposit may be either metals or sulfide limited or could have been controlled by the amount of available reductant (e. g., petroleum). While understanding of <b>sediment-hosted</b> stratiform copper ore genesis at the deposit scale is relatively robust, there are still significant questions in regards its position in terms of basin evolution. A wide variety of basin architectures and processes can lead to the formation of <b>sediment-hosted</b> stratiform copper deposits. Despite general agreement that sulfides postdate sedimentation, the absolute age of mineralization in many deposits has been difficult to document and the available evidence suggests that deposits can form throughout a basin's evolution from early diagenesis of ore host sediments to basin inversion and metamorphism.

40|$|Secondary ion {{microscopic}} elemental distribution {{maps and}} quantitative measurements of Au and As concentrations insamples from five <b>sediment-hosted</b> disseminated gold deposits in Nevada present a consistent {{picture of the}} location and nature of gold in these samples. Gold is present in arsenian pyrite that forms overgrowth rims on, and narrow veinlets in, gold-free pyrite (and possibly other minerals, but only to a minor extent). Auriferous overgrowth rims that may exhibit compositional zoning, either simple or oscillatory, range from approxi-mately 25 #m in thickness {{to the limits of}} microscopic resolution. Because all of the observed gold-bearing pyrite contains ufficient As to be metastable (i. e., in excess of [...] - 0. 5 %), it is suggested that small native gold grains occasionally observed in unweathered <b>sediment-hosted</b> disseminated gold ores resulted from exsolution of gold from the arsenian pyrite lattice. Available vidence suggests hat gold in arsenian pyrite is most likely present as a charged species (Au + 3) and that gold probably was deposited with arsenic as coupled solid solution substitutions inpyrite. The codeposition of gold and arsenic in pyrite in these and many other deposits may be a function of a redox reaction involving oxidation of gold and concurrent reduction of arsenic. Commonly proposed reactions involving gold deposition in <b>sediment-hosted</b> disseminated gold deposits usually involve gold precipitation as a neutral species from a bisulfide complex. It is proposed that such reactions are inappropriate for gold deposition in arsenian pyrite but that reactions involving oxidation of gold and concurrent reduction of arsenic are probably more appropriate.

Deposit types include {{porphyry}} copper and epithermal Cu­Au, volcanic-hosted massive sulphide (VMS), orogenic gold, Fe-oxide­Cu­Au, anorthosite Fe­Ti-oxide and <b>sediment-hosted</b> base-metal deposits. Most of them formed during short-lived magmatic events {{in a wide range of}} tectonic settings; many can be related to specific tectonic processes such as subduction, hinge retreat, accretion of island arcs, continental collision, lithosphere delamination or slab tear. In contrast, most <b>sediment-hosted</b> deposits in Europe evolved in extensional, continental settings over significant periods of time. In Europe, as elsewhere, ore formation is an integral part of the geodynamic evolution of the Earth's crust and mantle. Many tectonic settings create conditions conducive to the generation of water-rich magma, but the generation of ore deposits appears to be restricted to locations and short periods of change in temperature and stress, imposed by transitory plate motions. Crustal influence is evident in the strong structural controls on the location and morphology of many ore deposits in Europe. Crustal-scale fault­fracture systems, many involving strike-slip elements, have provided the fabric for major plumbing systems. Rapid uplift, as in metamorphic core complexes, and hydraulic fracturing can generate or focus magmatic­hydrothermal fluid flow that may be active for time spans significantly less than a million years. Once a hydrologically stable flow is established, ore formation is strongly dependent on the steep temperature and pressure gradients experienced by the fluid, particularly within the upper crust. In Europe, significant fracture porosity deep in the crystalline basement (~ 1 %) is not only important for magmatic­hydrothermal systems, but allows brines to circulate down through sedimentary basins and then episodically upward, expelled seismically to produce <b>sediment-hosted</b> base-metal deposits and Kupferschiefer copper deposits.

The Pb isotope ratios for sulfides inthe Sullivan deposit form a linear array, the Sullivan array.

40|$|Paleomagnetic {{methods have}} been used in {{economic}} geology to date mineralization in <b>sediment-hosted</b> ore deposits and thereby help to develop ore deposit models and understand the geodynamic settings in which mineralization can occur. However, paleomagnetic ages are sometimes inconsistent with other geochronological techniques and with geological observations. Here we test the veracity of paleomagnetic ages for <b>sediment-hosted</b> ores through a study of the Irish Midlands ore field. We find that unaltered rocks distal to mineralization that are of equivalent age to the ore host sequence have comparable characteristic remanent magnetic directions to those previously derived from the ores. This indicates that remagnetization of the rocks was probably independent of the ore-forming process. Comparison with the apparent polar wander path for Europe suggests an age of ca. 310 Ma for this event, consistent with the timing of the Variscan orogeny. Fold test results support this, indicating the signal was acquired after tilting and/or folding of the host rocks. Petrology and magnetic data suggest that nanometric magnetite particles are the remanence carrier. Based on independent geochronological and geological constraints, we conclude that mineralization formed in Ireland in the early Carboniferous coincident with basin development and that paleomagnetic dates were reset during the later orogenic overprint. Caution is therefore warranted in the interpretation of paleomagnetic dates for ore systems, and geodynamic models for mineral systems based on these may be erroneous...|$|E

This study revisits the process mineralogy of the ore using modern mineralogy tools, which for such a large and complex deposit cannot but deliver significant value. Specific focus is given to copper mineralisation and the flotation of the sulphide ores in compliment to another MSc study from the Centre for Minerals Research focusing on mixed ore flotation (Kalichini, 2015).

This variation is in contrast to observations from similar systems in the Pacific and demonstrates the influence of factors other than chemosynthetic primary productivity in structuring infauna at deep-sea vent communities. Vent endemic fauna had limited abundance and were represented by a single siboglinid species at hydrothermally active areas, meaning that that the majority of local biota were those also found in other areas.
