25|$|Primates {{are well}} known for using tools for hunting or {{gathering}} food and water, cover for rain, and self-defence. Chimpanzees have been the object of study, most famously by Jane Goodall, since these animals are more-often kept in captivity than other primates and {{are closely related to}} humans. Tool-use in other primates are lesser-known as many of them are mainly observed in the wild. Many famous researchers, such as Charles Darwin in his book The Descent of Man, mentioned tool-use in monkeys (such as baboons). Both wild and captive elephants are known to create tools using their trunk and feet, mainly for <b>swatting</b> flies, scratching, plugging water-holes (so the water doesn't evaporate), and reaching food that is out of reach. A group of dolphins in Shark Bay use sponges to protect their beak while foraging. Sea otters will dislodge food from rocks (such as abalone) and break open shellfish. Carnivores (of the order Carnivora) can use tools to trap prey or break open the shells of prey, as well as for scratching.|$|E
25|$|Unlike grizzly bears, {{which became}} a subject of fearsome legend among the European {{settlers}} of North America, black bears were rarely considered overly dangerous, even though they lived {{in areas where the}} pioneers had settled in. Black bears rarely attack when confronted by humans, and usually limit themselves to making mock charges, emitting blowing noises and <b>swatting</b> the ground with their forepaws. However, according to Stephen Herrero in his Bear Attacks: Their Causes and Avoidance, 23 people were killed by black bears from 1900 to 1980. The number of black bear attacks on humans is higher than those of brown bears, though this is largely because the black species outnumbers the brown rather than their being more aggressive. Compared to brown bear attacks, violent encounters with black bears rarely lead to serious injury. However, the majority of black bear attacks tend to be motivated by hunger rather than territoriality, and thus victims have a higher probability of surviving by fighting back rather than submitting. Unlike grizzlies, female black bears do not display the same level of protectiveness to their cubs, and will seldom attack humans in their vicinity.|$|E
25|$|While most {{dedicated}} batsmen {{can achieve}} multiple centuries and potentially dozens {{of opportunities to}} score them, for many all-rounders and bowlers, it can be rare for an innings to last long enough to achieve a century because of his team-mates losing their wickets, or for the lower-skilled bowler to be effective enough in his stroke play to come close to a century on many occasions. Shane Warne, who was considered {{to have a good}} level of skill as a power-hitting lower-order batsman, played 199 Test innings as a batsman and achieved 12 half-centuries. He was dismissed twice in the 90s, once on 90, and once on 99. Ashton Agar, playing on debut for Australia against England, came in as the last batsman and compiled the highest ever score for a number 11 batsmen, but fell for 98 with a rash pull shot from a bouncer, after nervously <b>swatting</b> and missing at two previous deliveries. Nervous nineties are also applicable for the batsmen who get dismissed at 190s or the 290s. Steven Smith the Aussie skipper against West Indies in April 2015 and Younus Khan of Pakistan both missed a chance of a double ton (199).MS Dhoni got out in a match against South Africa at 98 in Johannesburg in a test series against South Africa. Similarly Sachin Tendulkar the Indian batsman got out at 99 against England in NatWest series 2004-05.|$|E

Elliot Barker then testified that Lamb had told him {{in an interview that}} he treated all people [...] "like bugs" [...] except for his uncle and grandmother; killing a human being, Barker told the court, meant nothing more to Lamb than <b>swatting</b> a fly. Barry Boyd then confirmed what Barker had said, and quoted something Lamb had told him in an interview: [...] "I hate everybody on the street. I probably will kill someone else before I die—it doesn't bother me—it's like killing a bug." [...] Elizabeth Willet, a psychologist from the Penetanguishene unit, then testified that in her tests Lamb had indeed been revealed to have a high IQ, but had also been shown to have the emotional maturity of a small child, aged between 3 and 6. He had few defence mechanisms, she said, and when confronted by impulses acted them out almost without exception and without appreciating their consequences.|$|E

He is initially pleased with the results in the present; amongst other perks, the family is now extremely wealthy and Patty and Selma have died, but is horrified upon discovering that donuts do not exist in this timeline and flees, only seconds before donuts begin raining from the sky. In another world, Willie attempts to help Homer, but is again struck in the back with an axe, this time by Maggie.

Because of the versatility of <b>SWAT,</b> the model has been utilized to study a wide range of phenomena throughout the world. At the same time, the research community is actively engaged in developing new improvements to <b>SWAT</b> for site-specific needs and linking <b>SWAT</b> results to other simulation models. This conference provided an opportunity for the international research community to gather and share information about the latest innovations developed for <b>SWAT</b> and to discuss challenges that still need to be resolved. This proceedings includes papers covering a variety of themes, including new developments associated with <b>SWAT,</b> applications of the <b>SWAT</b> model, the use of related modeling tools, how <b>SWAT</b> can be calibrated or compared to other models, the use of other simulation models and tools, and integrating <b>SWAT</b> with other models.

2500|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{innovations}} introduced by Soulcalibur to the gameplay system of its predecessor, Soul Edge, is the eight-way run. Previous 3D fighters had only limited movement along the third axis, with sidesteps and rolls providing useful but unsustained lateral movement. In Soulcalibur, simply holding down a joystick direction causes the character to run in that direction, giving the player a sense of freedom and deepening the strategy of the game. Soulcalibur also improved gameplay with [...] "forgiving buffering", executing the input for one move before the player's character has finished recovering from his previous move, and leads to executing a quick succession of moves (other fighting games such as the Tekken and Virtua Fighter series have relatively strict buffering requirements, meaning expert timing is required to pull off many combinations, but Soulcalibur features much more lenient timing to successfully execute a buffer). Finally, the Guard Impact offensive blocking maneuver shown in Soul Edge was given a deeper range of techniques in Soulcalibur, allowing players to push back or redirect attacks past themselves as well as <b>swatting</b> away an opponent's weapon to stun them.|$|E
2500|$|As {{they wait}} for the fly {{to land on the}} flypaper, the two talk about their families. Walt expresses that he should have died already and tries to think of the perfect moment to have done so: after he had enough money, after Holly was born, before his surgery and before Skyler knew what he'd been doing. He finally decides the perfect moment to die would have been the night Jane died. Walt then tells Jesse of his bar {{conversation}} with Donald Margolis, Jane's father, on the day that she died. He tries to calculate the chances of meeting both father and daughter in different scenarios on the same night despite having never met either beforehand, but finds the odds too astronomical to calculate. Jesse, who is unaware of Walt's direct involvement in Jane's death, is surprised to hear this, but before he can ask more, he sees the fly up near the ceiling. He constructs a make-shift support for a step-ladder, asking Walt to hold it steady while he reaches for it. Walt, nearly asleep, begs Jesse to not hurt himself getting the fly. For a moment, it appears that Walt in his sleepy state is about to confess to Jesse how he stood by while Jane choked to death, but he stops at apologizing for Jane's death. Jesse tells him Jane's death was nobody's fault, but he still misses her. As Jesse begins wildly <b>swatting</b> at the fly, a sobbing Walt falls asleep. Jesse fails to get the fly and with Walt asleep, starts to climbs back down, but sees the fly land on the ladder. He swats and kills it.|$|E
