5|$|The central siren {{is located}} at the Briarcliff Manor Village Hall. Since the 1950s, {{additional}} sirens have been located on Schrade Road and at the intersection of Long Hill and Scarborough roads. Firemen also are issued small radio receivers to <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> of a fire's location and which trucks should be sent. Company officers additionally have two-way radios.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to ion pumps, ion channels do not build chemical gradients but rather dissipate {{them in order}} to perform work or <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal.</b> Probably the most familiar and best studied example is the voltage-gated Na+ channel, which allows conduction of an action potential along neurons. All ion pumps have some sort of trigger or “gating” mechanism. In the previous example it was electrical bias, but other channels can be activated by binding a molecular agonist or through a conformational change in another nearby protein.|$|E
5|$|Aloy {{helps the}} Nora tribe {{fight off the}} Eclipse and then enters the door beneath the Nora mountain. She finds a {{recording}} left behind by GAIA, revealing that a signal of unknown origin caused HADES to activate and seize control of her functions. As a last resort, GAIA self-destructed {{in order to stop}} HADES. Without GAIA to maintain the terraforming process, the entire system began to break down. As a contingency plan, GAIA created a clone of Dr. Sobeck in the form of Aloy, in the hope that she would find GAIA's message, destroy HADES, and restore GAIA's functions. Aloy learns that Dr. Sobeck sacrificed her life to ensure the Faro robot swarm would not find GAIA. Aloy manages to obtain the System Override necessary to destroy HADES. Sylens admits that he was the original founder of the Eclipse, originally tempted by HADES' promises of knowledge. With Sylens's help, Aloy surmises that HADES wants to <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> to reactivate the Faro robots so that they can once again extinguish all life on Earth. Aloy kills Helis and helps fight off waves of corrupted machines, before stabbing HADES with Sylens' lance, ending the war. Aloy then journeys to Dr. Sobeck's old home, where she finds her corpse, and has a moment of mourning for her predecessor. In a post-credits scene, HADES is shown to still be alive, but trapped by Sylens, who intends to interrogate HADES to find out who sent the signal that activated it in the first place.|$|E

25|$|Two months later, {{just after}} the October 1973 Yom Kippur War, during discussions about {{convening}} a peace conference in Geneva, the Abu Nidal Organization (ANO) hijacked a KLM airliner, using {{the name of the}} Arab Nationalist Youth Organization. The operation was intended to <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> to Fatah not to send representatives to any peace conference. In response, Arafat officially expelled Abu Nidal from Fatah in March 1974, and the rift between the two groups, and the two men, was complete.|$|E
25|$|The {{operating}} system may provide facilities for handling exceptions in programs via IPC. Typically, interrupts {{caused by the}} execution of a process are handled by the interrupt service routines of the {{operating system}}, and the operating system may then <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> to that process, which may have asked the operating system to register a signal handler to be called when the signal is raised, or let the operating system execute a default action (like terminating the program). Typical examples are SIGSEGV, SIGBUS, SIGILL and SIGFPE.|$|E

25|$|In two-way trunks with E and M signaling, a {{handshake}} took place to prevent both switches from colliding by dialing {{calls on the}} same trunk at the same time. By changing the state of these leads from ground to -48 volts, the switches stepped through {{a handshake}} protocol. Using DC voltage changes, the local switch would <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> {{to get ready for}} a call and the remote switch would reply with an acknowledgment to go ahead with dial pulsing. This was done with relay logic and discrete electronics.|$|E
25|$|Also in that episode, {{the sonic}} {{screwdriver}} gets {{split into two}} pieces, one of which ends up inside a flying shark. The remaining piece {{is said to be}} signalling its other half in an effort to repair itself. The Doctor uses this to <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> through the half inside the sky shark to open up the clouds. Afterwards, the half not in the shark is left with Kazran Sardick. The Doctor tells Kazran that he can call him for help using the Sonic; though Kazran declines to do so. The Doctor had duplicates of this screwdriver, which he continued to use throughout his travels.|$|E
25|$|Following the Avengers vs. X-Men storyline, it is {{revealed}} that Janet van Dyne has not died after all, {{but has been}} shunted into a Microverse by Thor's spatial warp {{in the same spot}} that she appears to have died in Secret Invasion. Using her Avengers communication card she is able to <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> with help from a local being called Cru-Sani. Giant-Man, Captain America, Thor and Iron Man go into the Microverse to rescue her and find her alive and fighting against an evil despot, Lord Gouzar, who has conquered the Microverse. After defeating Lord Gouzar and liberating the Microverse from his tyranny, Janet and her fellow Avengers return to their normal universe.|$|E

25|$|Kursk was {{equipped}} with an emergency rescue buoy on top of compartment seven {{that was designed to}} automatically deploy when it detected any of a variety of emergency conditions like a fire or a rapid pressure change. It was intended to float to the surface and <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> that would help rescuers locate the stricken vessel. Some reports said that the buoy had repeatedly malfunctioned and had been welded in place. In fact, investigators learned that Kursk had been deployed to the Mediterranean during the summer of 1999 to monitor the U.S. fleet responding to the Kosovo War. Russian navy officers feared that the buoy might accidentally deploy, revealing the submarine's position to the U.S. fleet. They ordered the buoy to be disabled and it was still inoperative when the sub sank.|$|E
25|$|Before {{they can}} figure out their next move, the base is {{attacked}} by the Creature Commandos. During the battle Max reveals himself while posing {{as one of the}} Creature Commandos. Blue Beetle ends up unconscious and Max captures him, heading to the teleporter and leaving the JLI behind. When Blue Beetle is in captivity, Max injects him with an unknown substance. Tortured, he remembers Max's existence as the man who killed Ted Kord and destroyed his legacy. Jaime eventually manages to <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> {{to the rest of the}} JLI to lead them to Max's headquarters. He breaks out of the laboratory and attacks Max, who, having discovered the weaknesses of the Blue Scarab, zaps Jaime with a special beam and, just as the JLI arrives, shoots him in the head with a blaster, apparently killing him in the same manner as his predecessor.|$|E

[...] Revere first gave instructions to <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> to Charlestown using lanterns hung in the steeple of Boston's Old North Church. He then traveled the northern water route, crossing {{the mouth of the}} Charles River by rowboat, slipping past the British warship HMS Somerset at anchor. Crossings were banned at that hour, but Revere safely landed in Charlestown and rode west to Lexington, warning almost every house along the route. Additional riders were sent north from Charlestown.|$|E

In the tunnels, only one tram can operate in each direction; this is regulated by lights and an automatic Train Protection system. Signaling uses the German BOStrab system, not traditional Norwegian light signals. The line has traffic signal preemption, so the trams <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> to the traffic light control when the driver starts the door-closing signal to give the tram priority at traffic lights.|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of the machines were designed by Martin Laing, a crew member on Cameron's Titanic and Ghosts of the Abyss. McG described many of the machines as having an H. R. Giger influence. McG's intent {{was to create a}} gritty, tactile 2018 on screen, and Laing concurred the robots would have to be black and degraded as none of them are new. Laing devised Aerostats, which are smaller versions of the Aerial Hunter Killers from the previous films. The Aerostats <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> to the [...] humanoid Harvesters. They are very big and slow, so they use Mototerminators to capture humans, and the Harvesters place them in Transporters. Laing was unsure of how to design the Transporters until he saw a cattle transport while driving through Albuquerque.|$|E
