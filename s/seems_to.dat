5|$|Charles Diehl {{regarded}} early 7th-century Byzantine Africa to {{have undergone}} {{an economic and}} demographic decline, being under constant threat by hostile Berbers. Later historians, however, have had to revise this picture in light of archaeological evidence: the Exarchate {{was among the most}} affluent areas of the Byzantine Empire, though of lesser wealth and significance than Egypt. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have seen much less warfare than the Balkans, Mesopotamia and the Caucasus did in that era, thus allowing its residents a safer way of life. There is evidence of ongoing trade between Byzantine Africa and Frankish Gaul during the 7th century. Agriculture was thriving, particularly {{in the vicinity of the}} Medjerda River. The production of grain, olive oil and wine kept the local population well-fed and probably supplied their maritime trade. Fishing <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have been another thriving field. The local elite <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have invested in the building of churches. The main testaments to their existence and activities are examples of funerary art, particularly mosaics. Heraclius the Elder <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have established ties with this elite. His son, Heraclius the Younger, married his first wife Eudokia during the 7th century. Her father was Rogas, a landowner in the Exarchate.|$|E

A 40% decrease in red panda populations {{has been reported in}} China over the last 50 years, and populations in western Himalayan areas are considered to be lower.|$|E

25|$|Rather {{than the}} formal definition, {{it is more}} {{understandable}} with some historical context. The British generally <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be most consistent between theory and practice, although the minimum-effort theory, which worked in Malaya, did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> apply to Northern Ireland. French doctrine {{at the turn of}} the 20th century, involving working with locals, did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be the heart of doctrine in Algeria and Indochina. France does <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> manage cooperation with former colonies, now clients.|$|R

5|$|More recently, {{the most}} {{extensive}} collection of phonetic data so far in Mongolian studies {{has been applied to}} a partial account of stress placement in the closely related Chakhar dialect. The conclusion is drawn that di- and trisyllabic words with a short first syllable are stressed on the second syllable. But if their first syllable is long, then the data for different acoustic parameters <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> support conflicting conclusions: intensity data often <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> indicate that the first syllable is stressed, while F0 <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> indicate that it is the second syllable that is stressed.|$|E
50|$|Town's {{fortunes}} {{during the}} season didn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> improve on the previous season. Even the 14 goals from veteran Peter Doherty didn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> pull Town away from almost certain relegation. Relegation <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be certain for 2 out of Town, Preston North End and Sheffield United.

It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> draw the mantle off and drop it on the ground, and then it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be his Little Dorrit in her old, worn dress.

5|$|Philip had no {{intention}} of handing over Amphipolis to the Athenians, but acted as if he was just delaying the transfer of the city. He <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have gone straight on to besiege Pydna after capturing Amphipolis. The Athenians, perhaps still hoping to receive Amphipolis if they allowed Philip to take Pydna, do not seem to have tried to intervene (and may not have been able to). Pydna <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have fallen to Philip by treachery, in either 357 or 356 BC.|$|E

5|$|Thirdly, the teleological {{explanation}} of adaptation is uncomfortable because it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> require backward causation, in which existing traits are explained by future outcomes; because it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> attribute {{the action of}} a conscious mind when none {{is assumed to be}} present in an organism; and because, as a result, adaptation looks impossible to test empirically.|$|E

In AD22, he shared his tribunician authority {{with his son}} Drusus, and began making yearly excursions to Campania that reportedly became longer and longer every year.

Finally, in AD26, Tiberius retired from Rome altogether to the island of Capri.|$|E
