500|$|On March 18, 2013, the Kentucky Executive Branch Ethics Commission charged Farmer with 42 state ethics violations, {{the most}} ever {{registered}} against a single individual; the previous high was 16. Most {{of the charges}} against him stemmed from the previous year's auditor's report, but previously unreported charges included conspiring with his sister Rhonda, who was also charged, to falsify records submitted to Rhonda's employer, the Registry of Election Finance. Farmer's girlfriend was also charged for falsifying timesheets. These charges were followed by five indictments by a federal grand jury on April 19, 2013, alleging four counts of converting state funds and property to personal use and one count of soliciting a bribe in exchange for a state grant. U.S. Attorney Kerry B. Harvey said a federal investigation revealed that Farmer had created jobs in the department for his friends and girlfriend, who conducted personal errands for Farmer [...] including [...] "building a basketball court for Farmer, placing flooring in Farmer's attic and organizing Farmer's personal effects" [...] while on the clock. He also said that Farmer had kept some of the gifts ordered in conjunction with the 2008 Southern Association of State Departments of Agriculture conference for his own use and allowed his family to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>hotel</b> rooms reserved for agriculture department employees at the Kentucky State Fair. The indictment did not specify what bribe was sought in exchange for a grant to conduct an all-terrain vehicle safety class, but the charges from the state Ethics Commission mentioned that Farmer had received three all-terrain vehicles in exchange for awarding unspecified state grants. A Lexington Herald-Leader report noted that the indictment only included events from 2008 forward because the statute of limitations had expired for any actions prior to 2008.|$|E

As a direct consequence, the club was disbanded on 11 August 1960. Karlovac has won the first leg 2-0, however, one week later in Maribor during their <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>hotel</b> Orel, the whole squad was hospitalised with a severe case of diarrhoea, the players being poisoned ahead of the game: someone had put something in their pancakes.

40|$|Convention travel {{has been}} growing rapidly {{throughout}} the world {{in recent years and}} becoming a critical component of the hospitality and travel industry. Hosting of conventions, especially international conventions, can be used by host countries as part of a strategic marketing plan to publicize modern development, traditional culture, and tourism resources. It also stimulates economic growth in the hosting country. The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyze the differences between the expenditures of delegates <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> <b>hotels</b> and delegates not <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> <b>hotels</b> <b>in</b> each category. It was expected that most of delegates <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> <b>hotels</b> were foreigners and most of delegates not <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> <b>hotels</b> were local people. A questionnaire was developed by using the categories of the 1993 IACVB Convention Income Survey as a base and executed in Taiwan. The subsequent data allowed the comparison between expenditures of the delegates <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> <b>hotels</b> and the delegates not <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> <b>hotels.</b> Overall, the average spending per delegate was US$ 621. 62 in this sample study. The delegate <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> a <b>hotel</b> spent an average of 6. 79 times the amount the delegate not <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> a <b>hotel</b> <b>in</b> this 4 day meeting. Recommendations for further studies were suggested. Additional research would help Taiwan determine the economic impact of the convention industry on the local economy in the future. Such research would also serve as a base for the convention industry positioning itself to receive future government support...|$|R

After a thunderstorm grounds their flight in Dallas forcing them to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>hotel,</b> Josh grows impatient with his mother and decides to abandon Sam and his life. Blocked at all exits by hotel officials, he heads into a high school reunion to seek refuge. He later lies that his mother was a graduate, and he finds Derek Baxter (Chris Penn), a drunken man claiming to be his father. Before Josh has time to clear his lie, Sam appears and, shortly thereafter, Derek drives them to their [...] "grandparents'" [...] house to tell the good news. Upon entering the house, Derek overreacts to a picture of the real family and goes after Josh. After Sam hits him with a cueball, Josh reacts defensively and hits Derek on the head with a pool cue, supposedly killing him. In panic, the two brothers steal his rental car and begin their trek to Canada.|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} Hotel Transvaal {{is used as}} a case study to add to the discussion: 'How {{hospitality}} practices can lead to spaces of difference?' In the case of Hotel Transvaal, artists attribute'hospitality' principles to draw attention towards massive state interventions in the so called problem Neighbourhoods. The artists invite others to experience this transformation through a <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>Hotel</b> Transvaal. Hotel Transvaal is unlike any other hotel, since it is not fixed in one building, but includes an entire neighbourhood. A neighbourhood houses residents and Hotel Transvaal turns these residents into hosts and guests. These authors indicate how Hotel Transvaal, by playing with the organizing principles of hospitality, can facilitate difference by evoking unexpected becomings and intensities. This article is built up as follows: Firstly, the transformation process of the Transvaal neighbourhood is described, where the neighbourhood forms the context for Hotel Transvaal. Secondly, the setting of the daily operations of Hotel Transvaal is conceptualized as a space of hospitality, which can be regarded as a Deleuzian assemblage with a certain extent of organization. This conceptualization clears the road for the third part, a spotlight on the becomings and intensities which are 'produced' by the assemblage Hotel Transvaal. The last section discusses the becomings and intensities within a larger context of art, new space and cultural laboratories...|$|E
40|$|While {{hospitality}} {{is a great}} industry, {{it presents}} ample opportunities {{as well as many}} challenges. The most successful worker must have positive attitude and energy in addition being naturally friendly and service-oriented. In Kenya, tourism is a major industry and a key driver towards the Vision 2030. It has made major contributions toward the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), {{over the past few years}} and has thus contributed towards the economic development of the country. Large number of international travelers come to this country and embarks on adventure safaris, which helps in generating revenue for the country. Tourism has also helped in providing employment to a large number of people in Kenya. The hotel industry has also flourished because of this reason. A large number of hotels are regularly coming up over here to provide accommodation to the tourists visiting here for a holiday. Tourism generates revenues of nearly $ 500 million per year. The purpose of this study was therefore to evaluate and assess employment as well as career growth in this industry. The study adopted descriptive survey research design. Simple random sampling method was used to pick respondents for this study. Subjects for this study included 493 non-management employees working on permanent basis in the selected hotels. This study therefore involved a total of 133 permanently employed staff working in these star-rated hotels. Data from the respondents were collected using both structured and unstructured questionnaires. Descriptive statistical tools such as means, standard deviations ratios, percentiles and correlations were used to present the study findings. The results indicated that majority of workers in hotel jobs in Kenya (51 %) had diploma certificate while 33 % studied up to secondary level (Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education) without any post secondary qualification. The study further established that, only 10 % were degrees holders and only 5 % had post graduate qualifications. The results also indicated that training, experience, age, promotion and the hotel star-rate were key factors in determining the length of <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>hotel</b> job or moving to other unrelated careers. The study therefore recommended that, the management to look into the employee welfare such as salary among others to motivate them. The study further recommended the improvement of working conditions in the hotels to boost employees’ morale. These were recognized as the ingredients to employee commitment to the organization and establishment of employee’s career growth in the industry...|$|E
