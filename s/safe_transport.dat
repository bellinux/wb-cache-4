5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914, Lord Nelson became flagship of the Channel Fleet and was based at Portland. With other ships, she covered the <b>safe</b> <b>transport</b> of the British Expeditionary Force, {{under the command of}} Sir John French, to France. On 14 November, she transferred to Sheerness to guard the English coast against the possibility of a German invasion. The ship returned to Portland Harbour on 30 December and patrolled the English Channel until February 1915.|$|E
5|$|Also {{exceptionally}} challenging will be {{the movement}} and destruction of deadly agents such as sarin, VX nerve agents and mustard agent during the civil war. The chemical weapons convention disallows movement of such deadly agents outside the country holding them, but Security Council Resolution 2118 allows extraordinary measures {{to be taken in}} Syria. Some of the chemicals will need to be transported along the highway between Damascus and Homs, which is still contested as of December 2013. Syria has requested the international community provide armored vehicles to assist in <b>safe</b> <b>transport</b> of the chemicals. In February 2014, Syria stated that rebels had attempted to attack two convoys transporting chemical weapons.|$|E
5|$|International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Technical Instructions for the <b>Safe</b> <b>Transport</b> of Dangerous Goods by Air {{states that}} {{provided}} that pressure in diving cylinders {{is less than}} , these can be carried as checked in or carry-on baggage.

Security restrictions implemented by individual countries may further limit or forbid the carriage of some items permitted by ICAO, and airlines and security screening agencies {{have the right to}} refuse the carriage of certain items.|$|E
50|$|In 1866, Alfred Nobel {{discovered}} that nitroglycerin {{could be made}} much more stable if absorbed in diatomite.

25|$|Just like natural gas, the stored ammonia {{can be used}} as {{a thermal}} fuel for {{transportation}} and electricity generation or used in a fuel cell. A standard 60,000 m3 tank of liquid ammonia contains about 211 GWh of energy, equivalent to the annual production of roughly 30 wind turbines. Ammonia can be burned cleanly: water and nitrogen are released, but no CO2 and little or no nitrogen oxides. Ammonia has multiple uses besides being an energy carrier, it is the basis for the production of many chemicals, the most common use is for fertilizer. Given this flexibility of usage, and given that the infrastructure for the <b>safe</b> <b>transport,</b> distribution and usage of ammonia is already in place, it makes ammonia a good candidate to be a large-scale, non-carbon, energy carrier of the future.|$|E

50|$|As the 20th century dawned, the {{prevalence}} and capability of assassins grew quickly, as did {{measures to protect}} against them. For the first time, armored cars or limousines were put into service for <b>safer</b> <b>transport,</b> with modern versions virtually invulnerable to small arms fire, smaller bombs and mines. Bulletproof vests also began to be used, which were of limited utility, restricting movement and leaving the head unprotected - so they tended to be worn only during high-profile public events, if at all.|$|R
500|$|Personnel {{from the}} company were often {{at risk of being}} {{captured}} by the Japanese {{due to the nature of}} their operations, while a number of outstations were over-run and the men manning them killed. Indeed, the landing of Japanese forces on Papua in 1942 had required a shift from providing air raid warnings to furnishing military intelligence. As a result, many stations found themselves isolated behind Japanese lines, relying on the support of the native population whilst evading capture in order to continue operating. Later, as the tide of war turned in the Allies' favour, it became necessary for the spotters to move ahead of the advancing Allied forces and also compelled the spotters to work in close proximity to Japanese forces. In 1944, a team operated a station on Lake Rombebai, [...] in advance of the nearest Allied forces. Between them the spotters rescued or buried more than 200 crashed American and Australian airmen, caring for the injured and arranging <b>safe</b> <b>transport</b> for others.|$|E
500|$|In 1917, {{just after}} the United States {{declared}} war on Germany and entered World War I, Minton enlisted in the United States Army. He took an officers training course at Fort Benjamin Harrison in hope of earning a commission, but was not among those chosen to become an officer. In August he was granted a brief leave of absence; he returned to New Albany, where he married Gurtz on August 11. [...] He returned to camp in September and requested to repeat his training course, still hoping to receive a commission; after finishing the training he was commissioned as a captain. The American Expeditionary Forces, Eighty-fourth Division, to which Minton belonged, was dispatched to France in July 1918. Minton and his unit served on the Western Front at Verdun, Soissons, and later protecting supply lines in Belgium.

40|$|The {{opportunity}} of switching from road to rail or {{to a combination}} of road and rail (intermodal) transport is being considered in many countries with the objective of risk reduction in the transport of dangerous goods. This work presents a quantitative approach based on risk analysis for comparing the hazards of road, rail, and intermodal transport, aimed at defining criteria for selecting the <b>safest</b> <b>transport</b> modality. When comparing road and rail transport, the risk mainly depends on the hazardous characteristics of the product. The size of the containers is generally larger for rail transport than for road transport, and consequently the amount of product potentially released, giving rise to impact areas slightly or significantly larger for rail than for road transport. When comparing road and intermodal transport, route length plays the most significant role: the longer the distance, the <b>safer</b> the intermodal <b>transport.</b> ...|$|R
30|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} the adsorption on As (III) by a thiol-functionalized PS monolayer chip using DMSA as dithiol source.

2500|$|LNG is transported {{using both}} tanker truck, railway tanker, and purpose built ships known as LNG carriers.
