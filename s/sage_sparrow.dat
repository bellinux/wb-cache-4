40|$|I {{examined}} {{reproductive success}} and post-fledging dispersal of shrubsteppe-obligate passerines {{to determine if}} either mechanism might contribute to the reduced abundance previously reported for these species in fragmented habitat. During 1999 and 2000, I monitored nests of sage thrashers (Oreoscoptes montanus), <b>sage</b> <b>sparrows</b> (Amphispiza belli), and Brewer 2 ̆ 7 s sparrows (Spizella breweri) in fragmented, edge, and contiguous shrub steppe habitat in southwestern Idaho. The combination of nest success and relative abundance among sage thrashers and Brewer 2 ̆ 7 s sparrows was consistent with trends I would expect if contiguous habitat functioned as a source and fragmented habitat as a sink (only fragmented and contiguous treatments were consistently compared among all species). Nest success of these two species was significantly less in fragmented habitat, whereas relative abundance between treatments was similar. Conversely, nest success and relative abundance of <b>sage</b> <b>sparrows</b> were similar between treatments. I fit logistic regression models of nest success for sage thrashers and Brewer 2 ̆ 7 s sparrows using both local and landscape scale predictor variables. Heterogeneity of shrub habitat (Angular Second Moment) was included in models for both species (but at different scales) and was used to create maps predicting the relative probability of nest success for each species in my study area. I examined post-fledging dispersal of sage thrashers from contiguous and edge habitats only, as no birds fledged in fragmented habitat. Twenty individuals from 10 nests (1999, n = 7; 2000, n = 3) were monitored up to 44 days. To evaluate habitat associations of juveniles as they dispersed, principal components analysis (PCA) was applied to environmental measures around nests and dispersal locations. No correlation was found between habitat occupied by juveniles and time during the first 30 days away from the nest and habitat variability increased with time. Furthermore, dispersal distances varied greatly among juveniles. Lack of habitat affinity suggests that post-fledging dispersal might not be responsible for lower numbers of shrubsteppe-obligate birds in fragmented habitat. My results suggest that dissimilar reproductive success between fragmented and contiguous habitat could contribute to reduced numbers of shrubsteppe-obligate birds in fragmented habitat. I also {{found no evidence that}} post-fledging dispersal might function to decrease bird densities in fragmented habitat and it may actually facilitate an exchange of individuals between habitats when they are adjacent. This potential source - sink scenario could lower the population equilibrium. Therefore, I recommend that managers should concentrate on preserving habitat conducive to successful reproduction. This might include identifying larger landscape configurations, via Geographic Information System (GIS) applications, that are correlated with high nest success (e. g. in my study, low shrub heterogeneity and high shrub composition was positively related to the nest success of sage thrashers and Brewer 2 ̆ 7 s sparrows). Subsequently, variables at smaller scales should be evaluated. Until we determine the relationship between natal and breeding habitats of shrubsteppe-obligate passerines, protecting habitats that correlate with high nest success likely is our most effective tool to minimize population declines...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2001 The {{encroachment}} {{of western}} juniper into mountain big sagebrush plant {{communities and the}} subsequent development of juniper stands results in significant changes in vegetation structure and complexity. This study described and compared vegetative structure and bird community measures among four cover types representing {{a broad range of}} structural stages among semi-arid, upland plant communities in central Oregon. Avian communities and vegetation were sampled in 4 vegetative structural stages (cover types), including: 1) post-burn grassland (< 5 years post-burn); 2) mountain big sagebrush-Idaho fescue shrub-steppe; 3) mid-successional western juniper; and 4) old-growth western juniper. The point count, or variable circular plot (VCP), method was used to survey birds in May and June of 1998 and 1999. Bird density estimates for each transect in each year, mean relative abundance, and species richness, evenness, and diversity were compared among cover types. Sixteen of 22 vegetation measurements were significantly different (P<_ 0. 05) among the four cover types. Mean bird species richness was greatest in the old-growth and mid-successional juniper types, with means of 22. 9 and 23. 6 species transecf 1, respectively. Bird species diversity (H) was similar between the old-growth (H'= 2. 499) and mid-successional (H'= 2. 416) cover types. Mean species richness was lower in the grassland cover type (17. 6 species transect) and lowest in the shrub-steppe cover type (11. 5 species transect 1). Bird species diversity was similar in grassland and shrubsteppe, H= 1. 820 and H= 1. 644. Habitat complexity was evaluated by comparing the diversity of coverage of plant structural types. Indices of habitat complexity were calculated for each transect by using physiognomic cover diversity (PCD). Bird species diversity was positively correlated with PCD (r 2 = 0. 535; P= 0. 0013). Total bird density was significantly greater in 1999 than in 1998 (P<_ 0. 05). Total bird density was greatest in old-growth juniper (6. 551 birds ha) and lowest in post-burn grasslands (3. 569 birds ha 1). Total bird density was similar in shrub-steppe and mid-successional juniper (5. 968 and 5. 542 birds ha- 1, respectively). Old-growth juniper had the highest total densities of both tree and cavity nesters. Total density of ground nesting birds was greatest in the grassland type. Total density of shrub nesting species was highest in the shrub-steppe type. Species consistently detected within all four cover types were Empidonax spp. flycatchers, brown-headed cowbirds, and northern flickers. Species detected in juniper stands but not other types included chipping sparrows, mountain bluebirds, mountain chickadees, Cassin's finches, American robins, ash-throated flycatchers, and dark-eyed juncos. The most common species in the shrub-steppe were also present in mid-successional juniper, but at lower densities. Species composition in mid-successional juniper was a mixture of shrub-associated and tree-associated bird species. Many bird species that regularly occurred in old-growth juniper also occurred in mid-successional juniper, however, density and richness of shrub nesting species was lower in old-growth juniper. Mountain chickadees, Cassin's finches, chipping sparrows, brown-headed cowbirds, mountain bluebirds, and dark-eyed juncos, Empidonax spp. flycatchers, ashthroated flycatchers, and northern flickers were correlated with juniper canopy cover, canopy volume, total tree density, and average tree height. Vesper sparrows, western meadowlarks, green-tailed towhees, and horned larks were correlated with vertical density of herbaceous vegetation, total vertical density of all vegetative functional groups, and perennial grass cover. Brewer's <b>sparrows,</b> <b>sage</b> <b>sparrows,</b> <b>sage</b> thrashers, and horned larks were associated with total cover of all shrub species, cover of green rabbitbrush and sagebrush, vertical density of shrubs, and bare ground. In the absence of fire or direct management actions, the transition of mountain big sagebrush plant communities to juniper woodlands will likely result in decreased densities or loss of shrub nesting and sagebrush obligate birds. However, sites {{in the early stages of}} juniper transition, with an intact shrub component, may provide both shrub and tree-foliage nesting bird species with suitable breeding habitat. Old growth juniper stands provide both tree and cavity nesting species with breeding habitat, but shrub-nesting species will likely be absent or at very low densities because of low shrub cover. On a landscape level, a mixture of various ages of juniper stands, as well as juniper-free mountain big sagebrush and grassland will likely result in the greatest diversity of bird species...|$|R

Various researchers {{have not been able to}} identify any genetic differences between the Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout and the Yellowstone cutthroat trout, though in terms of appearances, the Snake River subspecies has much smaller spots which cover a greater portion of the body, and the two subspecies inhabit different ecological niches. The Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout was identified by some researchers as a separate subspecies by the mid-1990s, and is managed as a distinct subspecies by the state of Wyoming, but is not yet recognized as such by the neighboring states of Idaho and Montana. Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout is found only in the Snake River and tributaries below the Jackson Lake dam to the Palisades Reservoir in Idaho. Other non-native species of trout such as the rainbow trout and lake trout were introduced by the Wyoming Fish and Game Department or migrated out of Yellowstone. Today five trout species inhabit park waters. Native species of fish include the mountain whitefish, longnose dace, mountain sucker and non-native species include the Utah chub and Arctic grayling.Only four species of reptiles are documented in the park: three species of snakes which are the wandering garter snake, the less commonly seen valley garter snake and rubber boa, as well as one lizard species, the northern sagebrush lizard, that was first reported in 1992. None of the species are venomous. Six amphibian species have been documented including the Columbia spotted frog, boreal chorus frog, tiger salamander and the increasingly rare boreal toad and northern leopard frog. A sixth amphibian species, the bullfrog, was introduced. An estimated 10,000 insect species frequent the park; they pollinate plants, provide a food source for birds, fish, mammals and other animals, and help in the decomposition of wood. In one example of the importance of insects to the ecosystem, swarms of Army cutworm moths die in huge numbers after mating and provide a high fat and protein diet for bears and other predators. One study concluded that when this moth species is most available, bears consume 40,000 moths per day which is roughly 20,000 kcal/day.|$|R
