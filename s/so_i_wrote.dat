25|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> {{this song}} that I loved and I {{sent it to}} them and he and Joel, I remember, left me a great message saying, I hate you, you bastard, I love this song. We're gonna have to do it. We're gonna have to re-build the Wiltern Theater, which they had taken down, it was {{a million dollars to}} re-do the ending... and I felt all his hostility for Universal. A guy named Sean Daniels, who was head of production, one day said to me, well there is hostility because we {{understand}} you waited about eight months to come up with that final song and you never did it. I said, where'd you hear that? I did it in two days. He said, Jimmy Iovine. So I went to Jimmy Iovine and I said all that to his, yeah it's true, I know. I blamed you but you can't be upset with me. I'm not like a writer. I've gotta make my way with these people. I had to have a scapegoat.|$|E
500|$|The revived Doctor Who {{series was}} to feature a script by Stephen Fry, {{set in the}} 1920s. Rumours {{appeared}} on the BBC's websites shortly after the airing of the new Series 1 and the story was pencilled in as the eleventh episode of Series 2. According to a video diary entry by David Tennant, Fry attended the very first cast read-through for Series 2, indicating that his script was still under consideration at that point. Due to budgetary constraints, the episode was moved to Series 3 and replaced by Fear Her. The story was subsequently abandoned, as Fry did not have spare time for the rewriting necessary to replace Rose with Martha. Fry said, [...] "They {{asked me to do}} a series and I tried, but I just ran out of time, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> a pathetic letter of [...] "I'm sorry I can't do this" [...] to Davies." ...|$|E
500|$|Rodriguez wrote Machete in 1993 {{as a full}} {{feature for}} Danny Trejo. [...] "I had cast him in Desperado and I {{remember}} thinking, 'Wow, this guy should have his own series of Mexploitation movies like Charles Bronson or like Jean-Claude Van Damme.' <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> him this idea of a federale from Mexico who gets hired to do hatchet jobs in the U.S. I had heard sometimes FBI or DEA have a really tough job that they don't {{want to get their}} own agents killed on, they'll hire an agent from Mexico to come do the job for $25,000. I thought, 'That's Machete. He would come and do a really dangerous job for {{a lot of money to}} him but for everyone else over here it's peanuts.' But I never got around to making it." [...] The trailer was made into a feature film which was released in September 2010; a sequel, Machete Kills (2013), followed.|$|E

500|$|Starbucks founder Howard Schultz {{reached out}} to Turlington to support her {{foundation}} Every Mother Counts, which seeks to make pregnancy and childbirth safe for mothers. David Legry, who served as Starbucks' editorial manager, helped shape the compilation after reading about Turlington's humanitarian work, and later worked with artists to select suitable songs. Turlington then recruited several artists, including: Carla Bruni, Sheryl Crow, Jennifer Lopez, Madonna, her friend Gwyneth Paltrow, and Martha Wainwright, {{to contribute to the}} project. She contacted all participating artists, and recalled: We already had our soundtrack, and I already had Martha Wainwright singing [...] "No Woman, No Cry," [...] which was great, but it got us all thinking that a compilation CD would be a great way to target women who are artists and also mothers and see what they're willing to contribute. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> some letters and spoke to a few of the women that are on the CD, and threw the idea out and pretty much everybody that we went to is on this list and said yes and was really excited.|$|E
500|$|Niffenegger is {{an artist}} {{who teaches at the}} Center for Book and Paper Arts at Columbia College Chicago, where she prepares editions of handpainted books. She {{produced}} some of her earlier works in editions of ten copies, which were sold in art galleries. However, she decided that The Time Traveler's Wife {{would have to be a}} novel: [...] "I got the idea for the title, and when I draw I have this big drawing table covered with brown paper, and I write ideas down on the paper. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> down this title and after a while I started to think about it. I couldn't think of a way to make it a picture book because still pictures don't represent time very well, so I decided to write a novel." [...] She was intrigued by the title because [...] "it immediately defined two people and their relationship to each other". Niffenegger said that its source was an epigraph to J. B. Priestley's 1964 novel Man and Time: [...] "Clock time is our bank manager, tax collector, police inspector; this inner time is our wife." [...] Drawing her central theme from this image, she says, [...] "Henry is not only married to Clare; he's also married to time." [...] Other authors whom Niffenegger has cited as influencing the book include Richard Powers, David Foster Wallace, Henry James, and Dorothy Sayers.|$|E
500|$|After {{recording}} the second {{version of the}} song, Lennon {{wanted to do something}} different with it, as Martin remembered: [...] "He'd wanted it as a gentle dreaming song, but he said it had come out too raucous. He asked me if I could write him a new line-up with the strings. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> a new score (with four trumpets and three cellos) and we recorded that, but he didn't like it." [...] Meanwhile, on 8 and 9 December, another basic track was recorded, using Mellotron, electric guitar, piano, backwards-recorded cymbals, and swarmandel, an Indian version of the zither. After reviewing the tapes of Martin's version and the original, Lennon told Martin that he liked both versions, although Martin had to tell Lennon that the orchestral score was at a faster tempo and in a higher key (B major) than the first version (A major). Lennon said, [...] "You can fix it, George", giving Martin and Geoff Emerick, the band's recording engineer, the difficult task of joining the two takes together. With only a pair of editing scissors, two tape machines and a vari-speed control, Emerick compensated for the differences in key and speed by increasing the speed of the first version and decreasing the speed of the second. He then spliced the versions together, starting the orchestral score {{in the middle of the}} second chorus. (Since the first version did not include a chorus after the first verse, he also spliced in the first seven words of the chorus from elsewhere in the first version.) The pitch-shifting in joining the versions gave Lennon's lead vocal a slightly other-worldly [...] "swimming" [...] quality.|$|E

500|$|The album's first song, [...] "Tired of Sex", {{written before}} {{the release of}} the Blue Album, has Cuomo {{describing}} meaningless sex encounters with groupies, reciting his list of encounters and wondering why true love eludes him. [...] "Across the Sea" [...] was inspired by a letter Cuomo received from a Japanese fan: [...] "When I got the letter, I fell in love with her. It was such a great letter. I was very lonely at the time, {{but at the same time}} I was very depressed that I would never meet her." [...] Second single [...] "The Good Life" [...] chronicles the rebirth of Cuomo after an identity crisis as an Ivy League loner. Cuomo, who felt isolated at Harvard, wrote the song after [...] "becoming frustrated with that hermit's life I was leading, the ascetic life. And I think I was starting to become frustrated with my whole dream about purifying myself and trying to live like a monk or an intellectual and going to school and holding out for this perfect, ideal woman. And <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> the song. And I started to turn around and come back the other way." [...] Lead single [...] "El Scorcho" [...] addresses Cuomo's shyness and inability to approach a girl while at Harvard; he explained that the song [...] "is more about me, because at that point I hadn't even talked to the girl, I didn't really know much about her." [...] The album's final single, [...] "Pink Triangle", describes a man who falls in love and wants to get married, but discovers the object of his devotion is a lesbian.|$|E
500|$|... "I'm Your Pusher" [...] sees Ice-T dissing fellow rapper LL Cool J. Ice-T {{explained}} {{later that}} he felt that LL Cool J was [...] "at that time on his 'I'm the great rapper in the world' thing. Me being from L.A., I was trying to rep our entire city alone, so had to step to him". Ice-T also replied {{that he had no}} personal problem with him but just [...] "thought I could beat him rapping anyways". Ice-T stated that he recorded [...] "Girls L.G.B.N.A.F." [...] as a humorous response to LL Cool J's song [...] "I Need Love". Ice-T stated that: [...] "Girls came to me and asked, 'Ice, why don't you write a ballad'? Now can you imagine saying, 'I need loooove?' That's a wimp. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> ('Girls') as a joke." [...] LL Cool J later retaliated [...] dissing Ice-T in his song [...] "To da Break of Dawn" [...] from his album Mama Said Knock You Out (1990). Afrika Islam said their feud ended when a group meeting involving Flavor Flav, DJ Red Alert, Mike Tyson and Afrika Bambaataa persuaded them to stop fighting. Islam explained Tyson's role: [...] " [...] down with hip-hop and the Zulus and I've always considered rappers like boxers anyway". Ice-T commented on the feud in NME magazine in 2012, stating: [...] "You need a nemesis in hip hop. It's part of what fuels good rap. L was coming out of New York saying he was the best rapper in the world. I was trying to get my feet out of LA. You can't have someone saying they're the best if you're trying to. We had a little hip hop thing but it was never serious." ...|$|E

She was replaced in the role by Isabel Jay.|$|E
2500|$|In 1965, he met {{the poet}} Youenn Gwernig who was a Breton American like him in New York, and they became friends. [...] Gwernig used to {{translate}} his Breton language poems in English {{in order to make}} Kerouac read and understand them : [...] "Meeting with Jack Kerouac in 1965, for instance, was a decisive turn. Since he could not speak Breton he asked me : 'Would you not write some of your poems in English? I'd really like to read them !...' <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> an Diri Dir ‚Äì Stairs of Steel for him, and kept on doing so. That's why I often write my poems in Breton, French and English." ...|$|E

2500|$|McCartney {{was living}} in Jane Asher's parents' house when he found the {{inspiration}} for the song: [...] "I was laying in bed in the Ashers' garret... I was thinking of it as a song for Ringo, which it eventually turned out to be, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> it as not too rangey in the vocal, then started making a story, sort of an ancient mariner, telling the young kids where he'd lived. It was pretty much my song as I recall... I think John helped out. The lyrics got more and more obscure as it goes on, but the chorus, melody and verses are mine." [...] The song began as being about different coloured submarines, but evolved to include only a yellow one.|$|E
2500|$|I must enjoy {{myself and}} tell you about Madame C. Royer who {{translated}} the Origin into French and for which 2d edition I took infinite trouble. She has now just brought out a 3d edition without informing me {{so that all the}} corrections to the 4th and 5th editions are lost. Besides her enormously long and blasphemous preface to the 1st edition she has added a 2nd preface abusing me like a pick-pocket for pangenesis which of course has no relation to Origin. Her motive being, I believe, because I did not employ her to translate [...] "Domestic animals". <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> to Paris; & Reinwald agrees to bring out at once a new translation for the 5th English Edition in Competition with her 3e edition [...] So shall I not serve her well?

2500|$|In 1947, Soros {{immigrated to}} England {{and became a}} student at the London School of Economics. While a student of the philosopher Karl Popper, Soros worked as a railway porter and as a waiter. [...] Soros {{received}} ¬£40 from a Quaker charity. In a discussion at the Los Angeles World Affairs Council in 2006, Alvin Shuster, former foreign editor of the Los Angeles Times, asked Soros, [...] "How does one go from an immigrant to a financier? ... When did you realize that you knew how to make money?" [...] Soros replied, [...] "Well, I had a variety of jobs and I ended up selling fancy goods on the seaside, souvenir shops, and I thought, that's really not what I was cut out to do. <b>So,</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> to every managing director in every merchant bank in London, got just one or two replies, and eventually that's how I got a job in a merchant bank."

5000|$|Regardless of genre or pen name, Meaker's {{books have}} in common complex {{characters}} that have difficult relationships and complicated problems, who rail against conformity. Meaker said of this approach, [...] "I was a bookworm and a poetry lover. When I think of myself and what I {{would have liked to}} have found in books those many years ago, I remember being depressed by all the neatly tied-up, happy-ending stories, the abundance of winners, the themes of winning, solving, finding ‚Äî when around me it didn't seem that easy. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>write</b> with a different feeling when <b>I</b> <b>write</b> for young adults. <b>I</b> guess <b>I</b> <b>write</b> for myself at that age." ...|$|R

[...] And I said, [...] "I...agree with you." [...] So I went to Bob Anderson, the Secretary of the Navy, and I said, [...] "There is machinery in the law which is very strict about the promotion and the Secretary can't dictate, but there is a way that you can write in a precept a certain qualification that you want, and we can write it so strongly that they can't accept anybody but Rickover."

And I saw the advert on TV and it was just like little clips of her songs. I had no idea who she was‚ÄîI was only like 10 so. I said, 'Oh yeah, that looks really good', <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> it down and I said to my mum, 'Can I have that for Christmas?' So she told my friend Dennis, who always gets me good music anyway, and he got that for me. So that was one of my first albums that I loved." [...] She would later tell MTV News: [...] "I kind of clicked into soul music more than anything else because of the vocals. You've got to have good vocals to sing soul music and I always liked it ever since I was little." ...|$|E
2500|$|Planet Terror is {{preceded by}} a fake trailer for a film titled Machete, {{starring}} Danny Trejo and Cheech Marin, as it had during the original [...] "double feature" [...] presentation of Grindhouse.
