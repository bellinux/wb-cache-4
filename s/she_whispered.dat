500|$|The episode flashbacks to the {{previous}} developments of several storylines throughout the season, including the love triangle between Rick, Shane, and Lori. Mazzara iterated that upon hearing of her husband's revelations, Lori was conflicted with several issues. [...] "All of that is going through Lori's mind. Rick murdered Shane and she did confess she had feelings for Shane. Her son {{was a part of}} it. They're all infected. Is her baby infected? We're out on the road, where is she going to give birth? What happens if the baby dies? What happens if she dies? All of these questions are going through her head. The thing that affects her most is that she played a role in Shane's death. She put those two men at odds, <b>she</b> <b>whispered</b> in Rick's ear and then she talked to Shane at the windmill. She realizes that this has been over her, and in a sense she has been an active participant in Shane's death. So she can blame Rick for that, but she's horrified by her own culpability." ...|$|E
500|$|Kate Winslet as Rose DeWitt Bukater: Cameron said Winslet [...] "had {{the thing}} that you look for" [...] and that there was [...] "a quality in her face, in her eyes," [...] that he [...] "just knew people would be ready to go the {{distance}} with her". Rose is a 17-year-old girl, originally from Philadelphia, who is forced into an engagement to 30-year-old Cal Hockley so she and her mother, Ruth, can maintain their high-class status after her father's death had left the family debt-ridden. Rose boards the RMS Titanic with Cal and Ruth, as a first-class passenger, and meets Jack. Winslet said of her character, [...] "She has got a lot to give, and she's got a very open heart. And she wants to explore and adventure the world, but she [...] that's not going to happen." [...] Gwyneth Paltrow, Winona Ryder, Claire Danes, and Gabrielle Anwar had been considered for the role. When they turned it down, 20-year-old Winslet campaigned heavily for the role. She sent Cameron daily notes from England, which led Cameron to invite her to Hollywood for auditions. As with DiCaprio, casting director Mali Finn originally brought her to Cameron's attention. When looking for a Rose, Cameron described the character as [...] "an Audrey Hepburn type" [...] and was initially uncertain about casting Winslet even after her screen test impressed him. After she screen tested with DiCaprio, Winslet was so thoroughly impressed with him, that <b>she</b> <b>whispered</b> to Cameron, [...] "He's great. Even if you don't pick me, pick him." [...] Winslet sent Cameron a single rose with a card signed, [...] "From Your Rose", and lobbied him by phone. [...] "You don't understand!" [...] she pleaded one day when she reached him by mobile phone in his Humvee. [...] "I am Rose! I don't know why you're even seeing anyone else!" [...] Her persistence, as well as her talent, eventually convinced him to cast her in the role.|$|E
