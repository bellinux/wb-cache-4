5|$|The A3 is a {{partially}} tolled motorway {{based on the}} vehicle classification in Croatia. The westernmost section of the motorway, spanning the Bobovica interchange and the Bregana border crossing, is tolled at Bregana toll plaza using an open toll collection system; the motorway sections east of Ivanja Reka interchange are tolled using a closed toll collection system, integrated with the A5 motorway as the two connect at the Sredanci interchange, forming a unified toll collection system. As of October 2010, Bregana toll plaza charges 5.00kuna (0.68euro) to passenger cars and 20.00kuna (2.74euro) to <b>semi-trailer</b> trucks. The toll charged along the A3 route between Ivanja Reka and Lipovac varies depending on the distance travelled and ranges from 3.00kuna (0.41euro) to 105.00kuna (14.38euro) for passenger cars and 10.00kuna (1.37euro) to 350.00kuna (47.95euro) for <b>semi-trailer</b> trucks. The toll is payable in either Croatian kuna or euros and by major credit cards, debit cards {{and a number of}} prepaid toll collection systems, including various types of smart cards issued by the motorway operator and ENCan electronic toll collection (ETC) system which is shared at most motorways in Croatia and provides drivers with discounted toll rates for dedicated lanes at toll plazas.|$|E

It was the deadliest transportation accident in New Brunswick since 1989, when a logging truck tipped onto a hayride in Cormier Village, killing 13.|$|E
5|$|Although railroads {{have lost}} much of the general-freight-carrying {{business}} to <b>semi-trailer</b> trucks, they remain the best means of transporting large volumes of such bulk commodities as coal, grain, chemicals, and ore over long distances. The development of containerization has made the railroads more effective in handling finished merchandise at relatively high speeds. In addition, the introduction of piggyback flatcars, in which truck trailers are transported long distances on specially-designed cars, has allowed railroads to regain some of the business lost to trucking.|$|E

5|$|Because {{they have}} to carry the large water tank and fuel for the burner, snow melting {{machines}} tend to be much larger and heavier than most winter service vehicles, at around , with the largest being hauled by <b>semi-trailer</b> tractor units. In addition, the complicated melting process means that snow melting vehicles have a much lower capacity than the equivalent plow or blower vehicle; the largest snow melter can remove 500 metric tons of snow per hour, compared to the 5,000 metric tons per hour capacity of any large snow blower.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning of December 28, police {{informed}} news sources {{that she had been}} walking southbound on Interstate 71 near Union Township when she was struck by a <b>semi-trailer</b> just before 2:30 am near the South Lebanon exit. She died at the scene. It is believed that Alcorn walked three to four miles from her parents' Kings Mill house, before being struck. The highway was closed {{for more than an hour}} after the incident. An investigation was launched by the Ohio State Highway Patrol, while Alcorn's body was transported to the Montgomery County coroner, where an autopsy was scheduled. The truck driver was uninjured in the incident.|$|E

5|$|The {{stage and}} {{associated}} props took twenty-four <b>semi-trailer</b> trucks to transport. The setup {{consisted of a}} main stage with three elevators and a turntable (which rose and lowered), a central runway with LED and strobe lights connected to a central stage with a LED view screen in the construction and an elevator. The two secondary runways were raised up into the stands and also had view screens inside the construction. Two projection screens were raised above the audience so those who couldn't get {{a clear view of}} the stage could still see the performance. There were also 3 LED screens that moved around during the performance, including one semicircular transparent screen lowered onto the stage during the video interludes.|$|E
5|$|The A2 is a tolled motorway, {{based on}} the vehicle {{classification}} in Croatia, using a closed toll system. As of July 2011, the toll charged along the A2 route between the Zaprešić and Trakošćan mainline toll plazas varies depending {{on the length of}} route travelled, ranging from 1.00 kuna (0.13 euros) to 42.00 kuna (5.48 euros) for passenger cars and 47.00 kuna (6.13 euro) to 187.00 kuna (24.40 euro) for <b>semi-trailer</b> trucks.

The A2 is the only motorway in Croatia which does not provide for use of the ENC—an electronic toll collection (ETC) system shared by most motorways in Croatia that provides drivers with discounted toll rates for dedicated lanes at toll plazas. In addition to the vehicle classification in Croatia, the motorway operator maintains an additional vehicle category for motorbikes, which are charged from 7.00 kuna (0.91 euros) to 25.00 kuna (3.26 euros) toll. The southernmost Jankomir–Zaprešić section of the motorway is not tolled, as {{it is part of the}} Zagreb bypass.|$|E

5|$|The A6 is a tolled {{motorway}} {{based on}} the vehicle classification in Croatia using a closed toll system integrated with the A1 motorway. The two roads connect at the Bosiljevo2 interchange, forming a unified toll system. Since the A1 motorway is operated jointly by Autocesta RijekaZagreb and Hrvatske autoceste, the toll collection system is operated jointly by the two operators. As of October 2010, the toll charged along the A6 route between Bosiljevo2 interchange (A1 Bosiljevo exit) and the Kikovica mainline toll plaza varies depending {{on the length of}} route travelled and ranges from 6.00 kuna (0.82 euros) to 33.00 kuna (4.52 euros) for passenger cars and 25.00 kuna (3.42 euro) to 139.00 kuna (19.04 euro) for <b>semi-trailer</b> trucks.

5|$|This {{leads the}} {{brothers}} to the riverside Sunrise Apartments in Jefferson City, Missouri. The boys manage to overpower the demons guarding John, and rescue him. However, they are attacked by Meg's demonic brother Tom, and Dean {{is forced to}} kill him {{with one of the}} three remaining bullets of the Colta mystical gun capable of killing anything. When the Winchesters later find refuge in a secluded cabin, Azazel reveals himself to be possessing John. Dean, while being tortured by the demon, begs his father to break free and save him. John is able to temporarily gain control, and then begs Sam to use the Colt to kill Azazel. Unable to bring himself to kill his father, Sam instead shoots him in the leg, causing Azazel to flee to safety. The Winchesters rush towards the hospital, but their car is rammed into by a <b>semi-trailer</b> truck being driven by a demonically-possessed truck driver.|$|E
