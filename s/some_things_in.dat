25|$|In the Internet of things, {{the precise}} {{geographic}} {{location of a}} thing—and also the precise geographic dimensions of a thing—will be critical. Therefore, facts about a thing, such as its location in time and space, have been less critical to track because the person processing the information can {{decide whether or not}} that information was important to the action being taken, and if so, add the missing information (or decide to not take the action). (Note that <b>some</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> the Internet of things will be sensors, and sensor location is usually important.) The GeoWeb and Digital Earth are promising applications that become possible when things can become organized and connected by location. However, the challenges that remain include the constraints of variable spatial scales, the need to handle massive amounts of data, and an indexing for fast search and neighbor operations. In the Internet of things, if things are able to take actions on their own initiative, this human-centric mediation role is eliminated. Thus, the time-space context that we as humans take for granted must be given a central role in this information ecosystem. Just as standards {{play a key role in}} the Internet and the Web, geospatial standards will play a key role in the Internet of things.|$|E

Kramer stated that Burns was [...] "designed to look like a vulture" [...] and look [...] "evil all the time", so in order to make Burns look happy and more sympathetic, the animators had to change <b>some</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> Burns' regular model. For example, Burns' eyebrows are not visible through the majority of the episode. The scene with Mr Burns and Gloria on the Ferris wheel was difficult to animate as well, since the animators had to [...] "keep everything moving to sell it." [...] In the scene in which Snake's house is burning down, the animators chose to color the sky red, in order to reflect the fire as well as make the scene [...] "a little more exciting." ...|$|E

Realizing his illness was terminal, he secured Zumwalt's permission to return to his command and serve as long as he could.

2500|$|Although Norwood {{received}} a sole writing credit on album cut [...] "Finally" [...] only, she noted Afrodisiac the most honest effort {{of her career}} yet based on its deeply autobiographical content, commenting: [...] "Everything I do {{has something to do}} with what I've gone through in my life [...] I definitely wanted to incorporate that in my art. It makes it more real when you add what's been going on in your life in your music. I've grown and I've gone through <b>some</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> my life, and I celebrate that, I honor that." [...] Soundwise, her collaboration with Timbaland, recent motherhood, life experiences, and growing affinity toward alternative music such as Coldplay, caused Norwood to shift toward a more matured outlook and raw nature with the album, a venture into the organic sounds of soul blues, ambient music, and the nostalgic street-wise sound of 1990’s hip-hop.|$|E

I think it was for the best". On October 30, 2001, Kittie released their second album Oracle. Sounding more aggressive than [...] "Spit", the album features elements of death metal and thrash metal. Morgan Lander noted how the band members were only 14 years old when writing their debut album and said [...] "We haven't written in 4 or 5 years." [...] She acknowledged a change in influence from their early days, stating, [...] "Then we listened to bands like Nirvana, Silverchair, and Alice in Chains. Now we listen to stuff like Cannibal Corpse and Nile." [...] However, the band would continue to write in the same fashion by first composing the music and then using that [...] "as the backdrop behind the vocals." [...] The album Oracle was recorded with Morgan Lander as the sole guitarist. Fallon's position as guitarist was filled by Jeff Phillips who worked as Kittie's guitar technician. In 2002, Talena Atfield left the band and was replaced on bass by Jennifer Arroyo. In 2004, the group added guitarist Lisa Marx, and Jeff Phillips went to work full-time on his side project, Thine Eyes Bleed. On July 27, 2004, Kittie released their third studio album Until the End.|$|E
