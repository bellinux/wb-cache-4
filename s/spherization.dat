40|$|We derive the luminosity-temperature {{relation}} for the super-critically accreting {{black holes}} (BHs) {{and compare it}} to the data on ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs). At super-Eddington accretion rates, an outflow forms within the <b>spherization</b> radius. We construct the accretion disc model accounting for the advection and the outflow, and compute characteristic disc temperatures. The bolometric luminosity exceeds the Eddington luminosity L_Edd by a logarithmic factor 1 + 0. 6 ln mdot (where mdot is the accretion rate in Eddington units) and the wind kinetic luminosity is close to L_Edd. The apparent luminosity for the face-on observer is 2 - 7 times higher because of geometrical beaming. Such an observer has a direct view of the inner hot accretion disc, which has a peak temperature T_max of a few keV in stellar-mass BHs. The emitted spectrum extends as a power-law F_E ~ E**{- 1 } down to the temperature at the <b>spherization</b> radius T_sp ~ mdot**(- 1 / 2) keV. We associate T_max with a few keV spectral components and T_sp with the soft, 0. 1 - 0. 2 keV components observed in ULXs. An edge-on observer sees only the soft emission from the extended envelope, with the photosphere radius exceeding the <b>spherization</b> radius by orders of magnitude. The dependence of the photosphere temperature on luminosity is consistent with that observed in the super-Eddington accreting BHs SS 433 and V 4641 Sgr. Strong outflows combined with the large intrinsic X-ray luminosity of the central BH explain naturally the presence of the photoionized nebulae around ULXs. An excellent agreement between the model and the observational data strongly argues in favour of ULXs being super-critically accreting, stellar-mass BHs similar to SS 433, but viewed close to the symmetry axis.

40|$|We derive the luminosity-temperature {{relation}} for the accreting {{black holes}} (BHs). At the accretion rates below the critical Eddington, the BHs are {{described by the}} standard Shakura-Sunyaev model resulting in the L {infinity} T{sup 4 } {infinity} M relation. At super-Eddington rates, {dot m} = {dot M}/{dot M}{sub Edd} >> 1, a strong outflow forms within the <b>spherization</b> radius R{sub sp} {infinity} {dot M}. If the angular momentum of the outflowing matter is conserved and typical outflow velocities are {{of the order of}} Keplerian, the wind occupies 50 - 85 per cent of the sky as viewed from the BH, while the region around the rotation axis remains transparent. The bolometric luminosity in such a case is known to exceed the Eddington luminosity by a factor 1 + ln {dot m} and the observed luminosity is 2 - 7 times higher because of geometrical beaming. An edge-on observer sees only the soft emission from the extended envelope, with the photosphere radius exceeding R{sub sp} by orders of magnitude. The photosphere temperature follows the T{sub ph} {infinity} {dot M}{sup - 3 / 4 } or {dot M}{sup - 1 } relation depending on the velocity profile at R > R{sub sp} (constant velocity or a Keplerian profile). The resulting L-T{sub ph} dependence is consistent with that observed in the super-Eddington accreting BHs SS 433 and V 4641 Sgr. A face-on observer has a direct view of the inner hot accretion disc which in stellar-mass BHs has temperature T{sub max} of a few keV. The effective temperature depends on radius as {infinity} R{sup - 1 / 2 } (up to the <b>spherization</b> radius) and the emitted spectrum is a power-law F{sub E} {infinity} E{sup - 1 } extending from {approx} 3 T{sub max} down to the temperature at the <b>spherization</b> radius T{sub sp} {approx} {dot m}{sup - 1 / 2 } keV.

40|$|We give lower bounds for {{the growth}} of the number of Reeb chords and for the volume growth of Reeb flows on <b>spherizations</b> over closed {{manifolds}} M that are not of finite type, have virtually polycyclic fundamental group, and satisfy a mild assumption on the homology of the based loop space. For the special case of geodesic flows, these lower bounds are: (i) For any Riemannian metric on M, any pair of non-conjugate points p,q in M, and every component C of the space of paths from p to q, the number of geodesics in C of length at most T grows at least like e^{\sqrt T}. (ii) The exponent of the volume growth of any geodesic flow on M is at least 1 / 2. We obtain these results by combining new algebraic results on the growth of certain filtered Hopf algebras with known results on Floer homology. Comment: 21 page...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a model of}} spectral energy distribution in supercritical accretion disks (SCAD) based on the conception by Shakura and Sunyaev. We apply this model to five ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs). In this approach, the disk becomes thick at distances to the center less than the <b>spherization</b> radius, and the temperature dependence is T ∝ r^- 1 / 2. In this region the disk luminosity is L_bol L_Edd ln(Mdot/Mdot_Edd), and strong wind arises forming a wind funnel above the disk. Outside the <b>spherization</b> radius, the disk is thin and its total luminosity is Eddington, L_Edd. The thin disk heats the wind from below. From the inner side of the funnel the wind is heated by the supercritical disk. In this paper we do not consider Comptonization in the inner hot winds which must cover the deep supercritical disk regions. Our model is technically similar to the DISKIR model of Gierlinski et al. The models differ in disk type (standard - supercritical) and irradiation (disk - wind). We propose to distinguish between these two models in the X-ray region, 0. 3 - 1 keV, where the SCAD model has a flat nu F_nu spectrum, and the DISKIR model never has a flat part, as {{it is based on}} the standard alpha-disk. An important difference between the models can be found in their resulting black hole masses. In application to the ULX spectra, the DISKIR model yields black hole masses of a few hundred solar masses, whereas the SCAD model produces stellar-mass black holes 10 M_sun.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} {{that can be}} responsible for the bimodal luminosity distribution of super-Eddington X-ray pulsars in binary systems is pointed out. The transition from the high to low state of these objects is explained by accretion flow <b>spherization</b> due to the radiation pressure at certain (high) accretion rates. The transition between the states can be associated with a gradual change in the accretion rate. The complex behavior of the recently discovered ultraluminous X-ray pulsars M 82 X- 2, NGC 5907 ULX- 1, and NGC 7793 P 13 is explained by the proposed mechanism. The proposed model also naturally explains the measured spinup of the neutron star in these pulsars, which is slower than the expected one by several times. Comment: 15 pages, 2 figure...|$|E

At the accretion rates below the Eddington, the BHs are {{described by the}} Shakura-Sunyaev model resulting in the L ~ T** 4 ~ Mdot relation. At super-Eddington rates mdot=Mdot/Mdot_Edd >> 1, a strong outflow forms within the <b>spherization</b> radius Rsph ~ Mdot. If the angular momentum is conserved the wind occupies 50 - 85 per cent of the sky as viewed from the BH. The bolometric luminosity exceeds the Eddington limit by a factor 1 +ln mdot and the observed luminosity is 2 - 7 times higher because of geometrical beaming. An edge-on observer sees the soft emission from the extended envelope, with the photosphere radius exceeding the <b>spherization</b> radius by orders of magnitude. The photosphere temperature follows the Tph ~ Mdot**{- 3 / 4 } or Mdot**{- 1 } relation depending on the velocity profile at R>Rsph. The resulting L-Tph dependence is consistent with that observed in SS 433 and V 4641 Sgr. A face-on observer sees the inner hot accretion disc with Tmax a few keV. The effective temperature depends on radius as ~R**{- 1 / 2 } (up to Rsph) and the spectrum is a power-law F_E ~ E**{- 1 } extending from 3 Tmax down to the temperature at the Rsph: Tsph = mdot**{- 1 / 2 } keV.

40|$|We study a {{stochastic}} {{variability of}} SS 433 in the 10 ^- 4 - 5 × 10 ^- 2 Hz frequency range based on RXTE data, and on simultaneous observations with RXTE and optical telescopes. We {{find that the}} cross-correlation functions and power spectra depend drastically on the precession phase of the supercritical accretion disc. When the wind funnel of the disc is maximally open to the observer, a flat part emerges in the power spectrum; a break is observed at the frequency 1. 7 × 10 ^- 3 Hz, with a power-law index β≈ 1. 67 at higher frequencies. The soft emission forming mostly in the jets, lags behind the hard and optical emission. When the observer does not see the funnel and jets (the `edge-on' disc), the power spectrum is described by a single power-law with β≈ 1. 34 and no correlations between X-ray ranges are detected. We investigated two mechanisms to explain the observed variability at the open disc phase, 1) reflection of radiation at the funnel wall (X-rays and optical) and 2) the gas cooling in the jets (X-rays only). The X-ray variability {{is determined by the}} contribution of both mechanisms, however the contribution of the jets is much higher. We found that the funnel size is (2 - 2. 5) × 10 ^ 12 cm, and the opening angle is ϑ_f∼ 50 ^∘. X-ray jets may consist of three fractions with different densities: 8 × 10 ^ 13, 3 × 10 ^ 13 and 5 × 10 ^ 11 cm^- 3, with most of the jet's mass falling within the latter fraction. We suppose that revealed flat part in the power spectrum may be related to an abrupt change in the disc structure and viscous time-scale at the <b>spherization</b> radius, because the accretion disc becomes thick at this radius, h/r ∼ 1. The extent of the flat spectrum depends on the variation of viscosity at the <b>spherization</b> radius. Comment: 20 pages, 15 figures, to appear in MNRA...|$|E

We {{show that in}} one of them the observed spin-up rate requires super-Eddington accretion rates at the magnetospheric radius, even if magnetar-strength fields are assumed. In the two other systems, a normal-strength neutron star field implies super-Eddington accretion at the magnetosphere.

These imply near equality between their magnetospheric radii R_M and the <b>spherization</b> radii R_sph where radiation pressure becomes important and drives mass-loss from the accretion disc.
