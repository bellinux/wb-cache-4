40|$|Effective {{utilization}} of structural timber requires grading and indicating properties (IPs) that {{are able to}} predict strength with high accuracy, and machines {{that are able to}} measure the underlying board properties at a speed that corresponds to the production speed of sawmills. The aim of this research is to assess the performance of a new machine strength grading method/procedure which was recently approved for the European market and to compare the performance of it with the performance of other available techniques. The novel method is based on laser scanning utilizing the tracheid effect, in combination with data from dynamic excitation and weighing. Applied indicating properties are defined in detail and results presented include assessment of the repeatability, coefficients of determination between IPs and grade determining properties, and examples of the yield achieved in different <b>strength</b> <b>classes</b> and combinations of <b>strength</b> <b>classes.</b> The investigated sample comprised more than 900 pieces of timber of Norway spruce (Picea abies) from Sweden, Norway and Finland. For this sample the coefficient of determination between the IP to bending strength and the measured bending strength was as high as R 2 = 0. 69, while the coefficient of determination between dynamic modulus of elasticity (MOE) and measured bending strength was R 2 = 0. 53. The yield in high <b>strength</b> <b>classes,</b> C 35 and above, become about twice as high using the new method/procedure compared to machines using dynamic MOE as IP. A comparison of the performance with what have been presented for machines that are based on X-ray in combination with dynamic excitation indicates that the new method/procedure will surpass such machines as well. ...|$|R

Finally, this paper presents a direct design methodology which was used to establish the firsts design tables for fibre reinforced concrete pipes presented in the scientific literature.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the possibility of}} applying the Compressible Packing Model (CPM) for the proportion of concrete mixtures produced with Recycled Concrete Aggregates (RCAs). As a matter of fact, the RCAs are composed of natural aggregates and attached mortar and, as a consequence, they generally present a higher porosity in comparison with ordinary natural aggregates. The higher porosity of RCAs can affect the resulting Recycled Aggregate Concretes (RACs) properties and, for this reason, the mix design procedure available in literature for ordinary concrete mixture cannot be applied as such {{in the case of}} RACs. In this context, the present work first presents a preliminary study in which the optimal mixing procedure for RACs is investigated and then, a possible extension of the CPM in the case of RACs is analyzed. Several structural RAC mixtures were designed for three <b>strength</b> <b>classes</b> (25, 45 and 65 MPa) by considering the variation of the aggregate replacement from 0 to 100 %. Finally, the proposed procedure is experimentally validated by performing mechanical and durability tests on selected mixtures for the three <b>strength</b> <b>classes</b> with a RCAs content up to 60 %. The results reported herein demonstrate the applicability of the CPM for recycled concrete mixtures and highlight as the rational use of RCAs lead to produce structural RAC without affecting its mechanical and the durability performance...|$|R
