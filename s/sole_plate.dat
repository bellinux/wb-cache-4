25|$|A tie plate, {{baseplate}} or <b>sole</b> <b>plate</b> is a {{steel plate}} used on rail tracks between flanged T rail and the crossties. The tie plate increases bearing area {{and holds the}} rail to correct gauge. They are fastened to wooden ties by means of spikes or bolts through holes in the plate.|$|E
25|$|The spindle router is {{positioned}} at the finer {{end of the}} scale of work done by a moulding spindle. That is to say it is able to cut grooves, edge moulding, and chamfer or radius the edge of a piece of wood. It is also possible to use it for cutting some joints. The shape of cut that is created is determined by {{the size and shape of}} the bit (cutter) held in the collet and the depth by the depth adjustment of the <b>sole</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{baseplate}} (<b>sole</b> <b>plate)</b> {{is generally}} circular (though this, too, varies by individual models) {{and may be}} used in conjunction with a fence attached to the base, which then braces the router against the edge of the work, or via a straight-edge clamped across the work to obtain a straight cut. Other means of guiding the machine include the template guide bushing secured in the base around the router cutter, or router cutters with built-in guide bearings. Both of these run against a straight edge or shaped template. Without this, the varying reaction of the wood against the torque of the tool makes it impossible to control with the precision normally required.|$|E

2500|$|There are two {{standard}} {{types of}} router—plunge and fixed. When using a plunge-base router, {{the sole of}} the base {{is placed on the}} face of the work with the cutting bit raised above the work, then the motor is turned on and the cutter is lowered into the work. [...] With a fixed-base router, the cut depth is set before the tool is turned on. [...] The <b>sole</b> <b>plate</b> is then either rested flat on the workpiece overhanging the edge so that the cutting bit is not contacting the work (and then entering the work from the side once the motor is turned on), or the <b>sole</b> <b>plate</b> is placed at an angle with the bit above the work and the bit is [...] "rocked" [...] over into the work once the motor is turned on. [...] In each case, the bit cuts its way in, but the plunge router does it in a more refined way, although the bit used must be shaped so it bores into the wood when lowered.|$|E
2500|$|The tool usually {{consists}} of a base housing a vertically mounted universal electric motor with a collet {{on the end of}} its shaft. The bit is height-adjustable to allow protrusion through an opening in a flat <b>sole</b> <b>plate,</b> usually via adjusting the motor-mounting height (the mechanism of adjustment is widely varied among manufacturers). [...] Control of the router is derived from a handle or knob {{on each side of the}} device, or by the more recently developed [...] "D-handle".|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to speed, fitness, artistic, or skating for fun, some skaters prefer to skate aggressively. Aggressive skating {{is referred to}} by participants as rollerblading, blading, skating or rolling and refers to not only the variety of maneuvers that include a variety of grinds, airs, cess slides, toe/heel rolls and other advanced skating stunts but also the equipment used. Aggressive skates are rollerblades that include aspects of the skate that facilitates grinds, this includes a plastic frame with a space in the middle for grinding, and, <b>sole</b> <b>plates</b> that allow the practitioner to grind {{on the side of}} the boot. Types of aggressive skating include Park and Street. The range of wheel size for aggressive inline skates range from 40mm to 72mm, the median ranging in the general vicinity of 53mm - 58mm.|$|R

40|$|Background: Some {{in vitro}} studies warn {{combining}} different metals in orthopedic surgery. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine the impact of combining titanium and stainless steel on bone healing and the clinical course of patients undergoing internal fixation of femoral fractures. Materials and Methods: 69 patients with femoral fractures had polyaxial locking plate osteosynthesis. The locking plate was made of a titanium alloy. Two different cohorts were defined: (a) <b>sole</b> <b>plating</b> and (b) additional stainless steel cerclage wiring. Postoperative radiographs and clinical followup were performed at 6 weeks, 3 months and 12 months. Results: Cohorts A and B had 36 and 33 patients, respectively. Patient demographics and comorbidities were similar in both groups. In two cases in cohort A, surgical revision was necessary. No complication could be attributed to the combination of titanium and stainless steel. Conclusion: The combination of stainless steel cerclage wires and titanium plates does not compromise fracture healing or the postoperative clinical course...|$|R
50|$|Control is {{an issue}} with jigsaws. The blades are small, weak and entirely {{unsupported}} at the lower end. Good cut control requires the presence of blade rollers, which keep the blade aligned just above the <b>sole</b> <b>plate.</b> Heavy cast <b>sole</b> <b>plate</b> saws are somewhat better than pressed steel for sawing line control too. To guide a jigsaw on curved cut, it must be steered (turned) and not forced to move sideways. The usage of sharp blades is important as well to get high quality cuts.|$|E

40|$|About {{three years}} after the Goldstone Deep Space Station antenna was dedicated, grout under the {{hydrostatic}} bearing runner was found to be interacting with the runner, causing rust to form between the runner and the <b>sole</b> <b>plates</b> upon which it rests. The rust formed unevenly and the runner could not be kept flat so in 1969 the grout was removed and replaced with a Portland cement and sand dry pack grout that was less likely to produce rust. In the years that followed, oil leaking from the runner assembly caused progressive deterioration of the drypack grout. In 1982 over one thousand hours of spacecraft tracking time were lost due to this deterioration. A plan was developed to rehabilitate the bearing. The plan called for raising the rotating structure free from the concrete pedestal and placing it on three pairs of external support columns. With the weight of the structure transferred to the columns, the pads and runner could be removed and the repair started. The very successful repair included the replacement of {{a significant portion of the}} antenna pedestal...|$|R
50|$|The 1917 Trench Boot was an {{adaptation}} of the boots American manufacturers were selling to the French and Belgian armies {{at the beginning of}} World War I. In American service, it replaced the Russet Marching Shoe. The boot was made of tanned cowhide with a half middle sole covered by a full <b>sole.</b> Iron <b>plates</b> were fixed to the heel. It was a great improvement, however it lacked waterproofing. It soon evolved into the 1918 Trench Boot, also called the Pershing Boot after General John Pershing, who oversaw its creation. The boot used heavier leather in its construction, and had several minor changes from the 1917 Boot.|$|R
5000|$|The house lizards {{belong to}} a {{peculiar}} family, the Geckos, and are found even in the best-kept chambers, most frequently {{on the walls and}} ceilings, to which they cling motionless by day, being active only at night. They are of speckled grey or ashy colours. The structure of their feet is beautifully adapted for clinging to and running over smooth surfaces; the underside of their toes being expanded into cushions, beneath which folds of skin form a series of flexible plates. By means of this apparatus they can walk or run across a smooth ceiling with their backs downwards the <b>plated</b> <b>soles,</b> by quick muscular action, exhausting and admitting air alternately. The Geckos are very repulsive in appearance. Bates, chapter 1.|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} solar load-bearing {{structures in}} the feet of feral horses and investigate morphological characteristics of the sole in feral horses and domestic Thoroughbreds. Sample: Forelimbs from cadavers of 70 feral horses and 20 domestic Thoroughbreds in Australia. Procedures: Left forefeet were obtained from 3 feral horse populations from habitats of soft substrate (SS [n = 10 horses]), hard substrate (HS [10]), and a combination of SS and HS (10) and loaded in vitro. Pressure distribution was measured with a pressure <b>plate.</b> <b>Sole</b> depth was measured at 12 points across the solar plane in feet obtained from feral horses from SS (n = 20 horses) and HS (20) habitats and domestic Thoroughbreds (20). Results: Feet of feral horses from HS habitats loaded {{the periphery of the}} sole and hoof wall on a flat surface. Feral horses from HS or SS habitats had greater mean sole depth than did domestic Thoroughbreds. Sole depth was greatest peripherally and was correlated with the loading pattern. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance: The peripheral aspect of the sole in the feet of feral horses had a load-bearing function. Because of the robust nature of the tissue architecture, the hoof capsule of feral horses may be less flexible than that of typical domestic horses. The application of narrow-web horseshoes may not take full advantage of the load-bearing and force-dissipating properties of the peripheral aspect of the sole. Further studies are required to understand the effects of biomechanical stimulation on the adaptive responses of equine feet. ...|$|R
40|$|The Semail (Oman–United Arab Emirates) {{and other}} Tethyan-type ophiolites are {{underlain}} by a sole consisting of greenschist- to granulite-facies metamorphic rocks. As preserved {{remnants of the}} underthrust <b>plate,</b> <b>sole</b> exposures {{can be used to}} better understand the formation and obduction of ophiolites. Early models envisioned that the metamorphic sole of the Semail ophiolite formed as a result of thrusting of the hot ophiolite lithosphere over adjacent oceanic crust during initial emplacement; however, calculated pressures from granulite-facies mineral assemblages in the sole suggest the metamorphic rocks formed at > 35 km depth, and are too high to be explained by the currently preserved thickness of ophiolite crust and mantle (up to 15 – 20 km). We have used high-precision U–Pb zircon dating to study the formation and evolution of the metamorphic sole at two well-studied localities. Our previous research and new results show that the ophiolite crust formed from 96. 12 – 95. 50 Ma. Our new dates from the Sumeini and Wadi Tayin sole localities indicate peak metamorphism at 96. 16 and 94. 82 Ma (± 0. 022 to 0. 035 Ma), respectively. The dates from the Sumeini sole locality show {{for the first time that}} the metamorphic rocks formed either prior to or during formation of the ophiolite crust, and were later juxtaposed with the base of the ophiolite. These data, combined with existing geochemical constraints, are best explained by formation of the ophiolite in a supra-subduction zone setting, with metamorphism of the sole rocks occurring in a subducted slab. The 1. 3 Ma difference between the Wadi Tayin and Sumeini dates indicates that, in contrast to current models, the highest-grade rocks at different sole localities underwent metamorphism, and may have returned up the subduction channel, at different times...|$|R

50|$|Many {{railways}} {{preferred a}} {{flat bottom rail}} section, where the rails could be laid directly on the sleepers, representing a marked cost saving. Indenting of the sleeper was the problem; where the traffic was heavy, it became necessary to provide a <b>sole</b> <b>plate</b> under the rails to spread the load on the tie, partly vitiating the cost saving. However, in main line situations, this form found almost universal adoption in North America and Australia, and in much of continental Europe. The United Kingdom persisted with bullhead rail in main line use, with widespread introduction of flat-bottom rail only starting in about 1947.|$|E
