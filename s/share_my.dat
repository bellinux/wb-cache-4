500|$|Peter Applebome, {{an editor}} of The New York Times, wrote in 2003 of his {{experience}} as an adult participating with his son in Scouting activities, [...] "I feel lucky to have had this unexpected vehicle to <b>share</b> <b>my</b> son's youth, to shape it, and to be shaped by it as well." [...] He concluded that, although Scouting is viewed by some as old-fashioned, [...] "Scouting's core values...are wonderful building blocks for a movement and a life. Scouting's genuinely egalitarian goals and instincts are more important now than they've ever been. It's {{one of the only}} things that kids do that's genuinely cooperative, not competitive." ...|$|E
500|$|In a press release, Jared Leto {{explained}} the meaning behind the music video: City of Angels' {{is a short}} film about this wild, weird, and wonderful land, Los Angeles, California. A place that has left its mark on the world's imagination and a place where dreams can actually come true. I made this short film so I could <b>share</b> <b>my</b> thoughts on this incredibly special place and talk to others about theirs. It's {{not so much about}} this particular city but more about the people who inhabit it." [...] He further said, [...] "It's a story about hope and dreams. It's a story about people making the impossible possible—whether it's Kanye West, James Franco, or a kid who's living on the streets on Hollywood Boulevard. It's a story about survival and about what it takes to become who you really want to be." ...|$|E
500|$|His detractors {{include his}} {{extended}} {{family and his}} father's former secretary, Barbara Wilson. She told reporters that Bamber used to provoke his parents, riding in circles around his mother on a bicycle, wearing make-up to upset his father, and once hiding a bag of live rats in the secretary's car. Whenever Bamber visited the farm, there were arguments, she said. Tension had apparently increased {{in the weeks before}} the murders; she said Nevill had remarked to her about foreseeing a [...] "shooting accident". Bamber's girlfriend, Julie Mugford, alleged that he had talked about killing his family. A farm worker testified that Bamber had once said of Sheila: [...] "I'm not going to <b>share</b> <b>my</b> money with my sister." [...] In March 1985 he reportedly told a cousin: [...] "I could kill anybody...I could easily kill my parents". Bamber denied having said any of these things.|$|E

At the Olympics itself, the team lost three games on its way to a bronze medal. The record represented more losses in a single year than in the 68 previous years combined. It was also the first time since NBA professionals became eligible that the U.S. men's basketball team returned home without gold medals at the Olympics.

500|$|In the new year, O'Sullivan {{returned}} to the Masters as the defending champion. He defeated Liang Wenbo 6–5 in a dramatic first-round match.

O'Sullivan then beat Neil Robertson 6–3 in the quarter-finals, and Marco Fu 6–4 in the semi-finals to reach his twelfth Masters final despite problems with his cue tip. In the final, he defeated Joe Perry 10–7 to win his seventh Masters title, setting {{the record for the}} most number of title wins at the tournament. After the tournament, O'Sullivan received a disciplinary letter from World Snooker over comments he made to the press after his match with Fu. He criticised referee Terry Camilleri's performance and a photographer during post-match interviews. This led to O'Sullivan stating that he would no longer give in-depth answers in interviews or press conferences, claiming [...] "when I <b>share</b> <b>my</b> thoughts, I risk being fined".|$|E

500|$|This Is What the Truth Feels Like {{features}} {{a range of}} genres; including pop, reggae, disco and dancehall, R, hip hop and [...] "punky" [...] electro-pop music. Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly viewed it as [...] "an album so directly torn from Stefani's recent, much-documented romantic upheavals {{that it could be}} called 'The Ballad of Blake and Gavin". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic added that: [...] "Stefani spends roughly half of the record singing breezy songs of liberation." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine commented: [...] "While an artist converting personal tragedy into creative capital is hardly new, the nakedness with which Stefani assesses the ruins of her relationship is stark, especially compared to the self-proclaimed guilty pleasures of Love. Angel. Music. Baby. and The Sweet Escape." [...] On writing about both relationships, Stefani claimed: [...] "I don't have any secrets; I don't have anything to hide. I haven't done anything wrong. I'm happy to <b>share</b> <b>my</b> story. [...] is really the only record I've written that's mostly happy; all the others are about heartbreak. And there's some of that on here—it needed that, to make the rest feel as good as it feels." ...|$|E
