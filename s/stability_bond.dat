50|$|The {{immediate}} impact of avoided level crossing in a degenerate two state {{system is the}} emergence of a lowered energy eigenstate. The effective lowering of energy always correspond to increasing <b>stability.</b> <b>Bond</b> resonance in organic molecules exemplifies the occurrence of such avoided crossings. To describe these cases we may note that the non-diagonal elements in an erstwhile diagonalised Hamiltonian not only modify the energy eigenvalues but also mix the old eigenstates into the new ones. These effects are more prominent if the original Hamiltonian had degeneracy. This mixing of eigenstates to attain more stability is precisely the phenomena of chemical bond resonance.|$|E

Using a stress test methodology, it quantifies the protection against macroeconomic shocks provided by the stock of dynamic provisions accumulated since 2001 and finds that medium-sized shocks would be fully absorbed, offsetting the additional costs caused by rising specific provisions. In addition, the paper simulates the path of dynamic provisions under the formulas used in Spain, Peru and Bolivia, showing that the alternative paths diverge significantly from the actual buildup and in part better conform to the Uruguayan credit cycle.

Sovereign issuance in the euro area is currently conducted by Member States on a decentralised basis, using various issuance procedures. The introduction of commonly issued <b>Stability</b> <b>Bonds</b> would mean a pooling of sovereign issuance among the Member States and the sharing of associated revenue flows and debt-servicing costs. This would significantly alter the structure of the euro-area sovereign bond market, which is the largest segment in the euro-area financial market as a whole (see Annex 1 for details of euroarea sovereign bond markets).

40|$|Within {{the context}} of the {{increasing}} discussion on a shift in financial regulatory philosophy from the currently prevailing rules-based approach to a more incentive-based supervisory procedure in which market discipline should play a decisive role in overcoming several moral hazard and efficiency problems of the financial system, the question regarding the evaluation of financial bonds has gained an important dimension. Such a disciplining market influence could namely be exercised if financial institutions were obliged to issue subordinated bonds on a regular basis (mandatory subordinated debt policy). However, the influence of market discipline will only be effective if the evaluation of different subordinated (and other) bonds occurs in a differentiated manner and dependent on the inherent risks.

The effect of doping has been investigated by varying the concentrations of dopants from 2 % (one atom of the dopant in 50 host atoms) to 12 % (six dopant atoms in 50 atoms host atoms) and also by considering different doping sites for the same concentration of substitutional doping. All the calculations {{have been performed}} by using VASP (Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package) based on density functional theory. By B and N doping p-type and n-type doping is induced respectively in the graphene sheet. While the planar structure of the graphene sheet remains unaffected on doping, the electronic properties change from semimetal to semiconductor with increasing number of dopants. It has been observed that isomers formed differ significantly in the <b>stability,</b> <b>bond</b> length and band gap introduced. The band gap is maximum when dopants are placed at same sublattice points of graphene due to combined effect of symmetry breaking of sub lattices and the band gap is closed when dopants are placed at adjacent positions (alternate sublattice positions).

40|$|First {{principles}} density functional theory (DFT) calculations {{have been}} performed to explore the stability, structural and electronic properties of Be and S codoped graphene sheets. The band-gap of graphene has been tuned by co-doping with beryllium and sulphur at different sites. The results show that by codoping graphene with Be and S, the band-gap increases from zero up to 0. 58 eV depending on the doping sites. The cohesive and {{the formation energies of}} the systems were also determined. All the isomers formed by exploring different doping sites differ notably in <b>stability,</b> <b>bond</b> length and band-gap. Nevertheless, the planar structure of all the systems investigated was preserved even after geometry optimisation. Majority of the isomers that correspond to co-doping at non-equivalent sites favour higher band-gap opening, but lesser stability, than the other set of isomers with equivalent doping sites. Bader charge analysis was adopted to account for charges distribution in the systems. As a result of the difference in electronegativity among carbon atoms and the impurities, it was observed that electrons accumulation occurred more on the carbon atoms in the proximity of Be and S than at any other position in the graphitic systems investigated.

Using data from 49 countries, the paper evaluates the effectiveness of macroprudential instruments in reducing systemic risk over time and across institutions and markets. The analysis suggests that many of the most frequently used instruments are effective in reducing pro-cyclicality and the effectiveness is sensitive to the type of shock facing the financial sector. Based on these findings, the paper identifies conditions under which macroprudential policy is most likely to be effective, as well as conditions under which it may have little impact.

Using a novel dataset derived from the Eurobarometer surveys, we show that, at the individual level, political ideology, distrust towards EU institutions and altruism appear more relevant than self-interest in shaping preferences for/against Eurobonds. However, at the country level, opinion towards Eurobonds strongly reflects the expected costs/benefits from Eurobonds' introduction for ones country.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the determinants of}} bond flows, now the dominant source of capital inflows, into the United States, {{as a means of}} establishing conditions affecting the financing of the U.

To test the hypothesis that capital flows have become more responsive to changes in relative interest rates and other conditions across borders, a panel data set, showing bond flows from 12 separate jurisdictions into the United States, is constructed for the period 1994 - 2006 using adjusted U. S. Treasury International Capital Flow (TIC) data. Panel vector autoregression and instrumental variables approaches are used to estimate the impact of changes in interest rate differentials and other fundamentals on capital flows into the U. S. The paper finds evidence for an impact from interest rate differentials to bond inflows that has increased over time. Under one plausible set of theoretical assumptions, the increased sensitivity can be interpreted as resulting from a reduction in home bias on the part of non-US investors.

40|$|Recent {{improvements}} in fiscal positions in advanced countries have sharply curtailed {{the issuance of}} government securities and created the possibility that government securities could disappear in some countries. The possibility that this might occur in the United States has attracted the most attention, {{in large part because}} of the international role of the U. S. dollar and the widespread perception that U. S. treasury securities have the lowest total financial risk (the combination of credit, market, and liquidity risks) among U. S. dollar assets. This paper analyzes the unique features of government securities and links them to the important roles that government securities, in particular U. S. treasury securities, have come to play in national and international financial markets. The paper then identifies and examines financial market-oriented public policy questions raised by the shrinking supply of U. S. treasuries.

40|$|We {{systematically}} {{explore the}} <b>stability,</b> <b>bonding</b> characteristics, and electronic and magnetic properties of two-dimensional (2 D) few zinc oxide layers (few-ZnOLs) {{with or without}} fluorination by using density functional theory approach. The pristine few-ZnOLs favor stable planar hexagonal structures, which stem from their unique bonding characteristics: The intralayer Zn–O interaction is dominated by covalent bonding while the interaction between layers is weak ionic bonding. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fluorination from one side turns the planar few-ZnOLs back to the wurtzitelike corrugated structure, which enhances {{the stability of the}} 2 D ZnO films. The fluorinated few-ZnOLs are ferromagnets with magnetic moments as high as 0. 84, 0. 87, 0. 89, and 0. 72 μв per unit cell for the number of layers of N= 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Most interestingly, the fluorination can also turn few-ZnOLs from semiconductor into half metallicity with a half-metal gap up to 0. 56 eV. These excellent electronic and magnetic properties may open 2 D ZnO based materials great opportunity in future spintronics. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
