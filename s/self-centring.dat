40|$|Two {{alternative}} passive {{seismic protection}} technologies have been combined {{in a single}} experiment to assess their synergy. The first, a nonlinear-elastic posttensioned tendon frame, uses steel tendons to connect structural elements. Joints can rotate elastically allowing large recoverable interstory sway.

The second, a metallic shear panel energy dissipator has a large energy dissipation capacity but, as it is unable to <b>self-centre,</b> may impart a residual sway or offset to a structure after a seismic event. This paper presents a series shaking table tests conducted at 1 / 4 scale to assess the coaction of these technologies under realistic seismic loading.

40|$|Controlled rocking steel braced frames (CRSBFs) are {{resilient}} seismic force resisting {{systems that}} can <b>self-centre</b> {{the structure and}} prevent structural damage during design-level earthquakes. Energy dissipation may be provided to limit peak displacements, while post-tensioning provides self-centering after rocking. Previous {{studies have shown that}} designing energy dissipation and the post-tensioning components in CRSBFs using a response modification factor of R = 8 is sufficient to prevent collapse of structures during earthquakes higher than the design level. However, designers have unique control over the hysteretic behaviour of the system, even after the response modification factor is selected. Additionally, recent studies have suggested that CRSBFs can be designed using higher response modification factors without a significant reduction in performance. This paper examines how the design of the post-tensioning and energy dissipation components comprising the base rocking joint influences the collapse performance of a three-storey CRSBF using the results of ten incremental dynamic analyses (IDA). Ten different base rocking joints were designed for the frame using different response modification factors, energy dissipation parameters, and post-tensioning parameters. A suite of 44 ground motions was selected and scaled until collapse occurred in at least 50 % of the cases, and collapse fragility curves were generated using the truncated IDA curves. The results show that the same CRSBF can have different collapse performances, depending on the parameters selected to design the base rocking joint. However, nine of the ten base rocking joints provided an acceptably low probability of collapse based on the implemented methodology...|$|R

Its slogan changed from “The Lancaster University Students’ Union Newspaper” to simply “The Voice of Lancaster University Students”. It also moved to its own campus headquarters in Slaidburn House in 1997, to which it would return in 2014.:260SCAN underwent perhaps its greatest changes, however, in the late 2000s and early 2010s. In 2008, editor Dan Hogan relaunched the paper as Student Comment and News, maintaining the original acronym while strengthening its brand culture. A year later SCAN switched publisher from Central Lancashire Printers to Trinity Mirror, going colour from cover to cover on 100% recycled paper. In 2010 the paper joined the Lancaster University ‘joint student media initiative’ sharing its membership, facilities, and coverage more closely with LA1:TV and Bailrigg FM, and editor Lizzie Houghton introduced arts & lifestyle section Carolynne as “SCAN’s stylish, more lighthearted sister”. The section is named after an older publication at Lancaster, founded in 1964 and rated second only to the magazines in Oxford, which publication was in turn named by Bowlander William Smethurst after his girlfriend, Carolynne Harmsworth. Most recently, in 2013, Rachel May Quin became SCAN’s first non-sabbatical editor. The position is now open to, and elected by, members of the joint student media initiative only, further improving the newspaper’s independence but resulting in a 97.3% drop in editorial election turnout from 2010 to 2015.For much of its history SCAN was not Lancaster University’s only student newspaper. It overlapped with historical titles like Carolynne and John O’Gauntlet, which provided far more comical, scandalous, and pointed coverage of student life at Lancaster but disappeared in 1971 and 1972 respectively.:87-107 In 1993 a short-lived parody of the paper, <b>Self-Centred</b> Arrogant Nonsense, was circulated around campus, and in 2012 a more elaborate imitation, SCAM: Student Comment and Moos, was “stealth-distributed” on the printers in the university library and online at scam.lusers.co.uk. More serious rivals in 2012 included The Whistleblower, which claimed to be “Lancaster University’s Only Independent Student Newspaper”, and Fritz, a high-tech magazine run by members of the Management School. Both ran on a platform of true political independence from LUSU, but neither could sustain the funds for more than four editions. SCAN now competes for readers with internet tabloid The Tab Lancaster and the Lancaster Despatch Box, a blog run with the Department of Politics, Philosophy, and Religion, both of which enjoy more national media connections than SCAN.. There were also college based newspapers, of which probably the most significant was Pendle Witch, which in the mid 1970s emerged from the new Pendle College and was the base for a serious challenge to the Students Union by an anti-establishment group. Ironically, its leader was Bob Lawrence who was then elected as editor of SCAN.|$|R

The elastomeric material, typically nitrile rubber, is bonded by heat and pressure to the outer ring, which holds it in place. This structure increases resistance to bursting, increasing the pressure rating of the seal. Because the bonded seal itself acts to retain the gasket material, there is no need for the parts to be sealed to be shaped to retain the gasket.

Most {{of the existing}} SMA-based strategies, however, {{are based on the}} wire or rod form of SMAs, where issues such as gripping complexity and fracture may exist. This paper presents a proof-of-concept study on an innovative type of SMA-based <b>self-centring</b> system, namely, a superelastic SMA ring spring system. The proposed system includes a series of inner high-strength steel (HSS) rings and outer superelastic SMA rings stacked in alternation with mating taper faces, where the resisting load is provided by the wedging action which tends to expand the outer rings and concurrently to squeeze the inner rings. The superelastic effect of the SMA offers energy dissipation and a driving force for recentring, and the frictional effect over the taper face further contributes to the overall resisting load and energy dissipation. The feasibility of the new system is carefully examined via numerical studies considering the parameters of ring thickness, taper angle, and coefficient of friction. The key hysteretic responses, including resisting load, stiffness, stress distributions, source of residual deformation, energy dissipation, and equivalent viscous damping, are discussed in detail. The behaviour of the SMA ring springs is also studied via analytical models, and the analytical predictions are found to agree well with the numerical results. Finally, two practical applications of the new system, namely <b>self-centring</b> HS-SMA ring spring connections, and <b>self-centring</b> SMA ring spring dampers, are discussed via comprehensive numerical studies.

The present study analytically investigates the behaviour of <b>self-centring</b> precast segmental bridge columns under nonlinear-static and pseudo-dynamic loading at different prestressing strand levels. <b>Self-centring</b> segmental columns are composed of prefabricated reinforced concrete segments which are connected by central post-tensioning (PT) strands. The present study develops a three dimensional (3 D) nonlinear finite element model for hybrid post-tensioned precast segmental bridge columns. The model is subjected to constant axial loading and lateral reverse cyclic loading. The lateral force displacement results of the analysed columns show good agreement with the experimental response of the columns. Bonded post-tensioned segmental columns at 25 %, 40 % and 70 % prestressing strand stress levels are analysed and compared with an emulative monolithic conventional column. The columns with a higher initial prestressing strand levels show greater initial stiffness and strength but show higher stiffness reduction at large drifts. In the time-history analysis, the column samples are subjected to different earthquake records to investigate the effect post-tensioning force levels on their lateral seismic response in low and higher seismicity zones. The results indicate that, for low seismicity zones, post-tensioned segmental columns with a higher initial stress level deflect lower lateral peak displacement. However, in higher seismicity zones, applying a high initial stress level should be avoided for precast segmental <b>self-centring</b> columns with low energy dissipation capacity...|$|E

A novel approach is used to achieve the desired sliding threshold in the connectors, and the wall uplifts when this threshold is reached. From a series of quasi-static cyclic tests, it is shown that slip-friction connectors can impart ductile and elasto-plastic characteristics to what would otherwise be essentially brittle structures.

40|$|The {{development}} of performance-based approaches {{for the design}} of structures to withstand earthquakes requires the capability to assess performance under different levels of seismic excitation. Although a great deal of work has been completed towards this goal, most of the efforts have focused on the maximum transient response or the cumulative energy dissipation characteristics as the main response indices. Considering the inevitable reality of residual deformations for systems responding in the material nonlinear range and the importance of these permanent deformations to performance characterisation, an alternative approach to quantifying performance is explored in this contribution. In this first of two companion papers, after discussion of the limitations of current performance assessment techniques to fully describe the post-earthquake state of a structure, the framework of a performance evaluation based on residual deformations including both structural and non-structural elements is first presented. A first insight into the parameters that influence residual deformations is presented through time-history analyses of hysteretic single degree-of-freedom systems. Hysteretic characteristics, post-yielding stiffness as affected by P-Δ effects, as well as maximum ductility are found to greatly influence residual deformations. It is also shown that without considering residual deformations, the performance of systems that are inherently <b>self-centring</b> cannot realistically be compared to other systems that sustain residual deformations...|$|E

The higher mechanical properties of LVL, when compared to sawn timber, {{in addition to its}} low mass, flexibility of design and rapidity of construction, create the potential for increased use of LVL in multi-storey buildings. The development of these innovative ductile connections in LVL, proposed here for frame systems, have been based on the successful implementation of jointed ductile connections for precast concrete systems, started in the early 1990 s with the PRESSS Program at the University of California, San Diego, further developed in Italy and currently under further refinement at the University of Canterbury.

Low re-centering capacity may lead to serious damage and even structural collapse due to excessive cumulative displacements.

In this paper are reported some preliminary results relevant to an extensive parametric study aimed to investigate the re-centering capability of Friction Pendulum System (FPS) isolators and its sensitivity to pulse-like ground motions. A wide range of devices and ground motions, characterized by different values of the isolator characteristic parameters (equivalent radius Req and coefficient of friction eq) and of the pulse-like characteristics of the seismic ground motion has been considered. The latters have been calculated in terms of the “predominant period” of the ground motion and through the introduction of a “kinetic Pulse Index” defined in terms of the rate of transmission of the kinetic energy.
