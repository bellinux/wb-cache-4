5|$|She was {{sensible}} how arduous a task it is {{to produce}} a truly excellent novel; and she roused her faculties to grapple with it. All her other works were produced with a rapidity, that did not give her powers time fully to expand. But this was written slowly and with mature consideration. She began it in several forms, which she successively rejected, after they were considerably advanced. She wrote {{many parts of the}} work again and again, and, when she had finished what she intended for the first part, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> more urgently stimulated to revise and improve what she had written, than to proceed, with constancy of application, in the parts that were to follow.|$|E
25|$|White {{described}} the vision experience as involving {{a bright light}} which would surround her and <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> {{in the presence of}} Jesus or angels who would show her events (historical and future) and places (on earth, in heaven, or other planets).|$|E
25|$|Elisabeth was {{strongly}} {{attached to her}} parents, especially to her mother, and was still a child {{in search of an}} identity of her own when an adult role with unusual obligations and restrictions was imposed upon her. She had no control in her new life and was unable to identify herself as both the spouse of the emperor and a young mother. As a result, she attempted to recreate her childhood with its lack of obligations. The only quality for which <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> appreciated, and over which she had control, was her physical appearance, so she started cultivating this as the primary source of her self-esteem. Obsessively achievement-oriented and almost compulsively perfectionistic in her attitudes, she became a slave to her own beauty and image.|$|E
6000|$|Elsa {{had never}} heard of Icarus, but <b>she</b> had <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> soaring upwards on heavenly wings when Andor--his lips {{touching}} her neck--had whispered with passionate ardour: [...] "Elsa, I love you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very nearly," [...] {{she said}} with the accent of pent-up sincerity, and even {{relieved}} because {{she was able to}} say something which <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> was true. For the last few days <b>she</b> had <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> several times near that madness which is but an intolerable lucidity of apprehension.|$|R
60|$|Thus admonished, Baptista {{entered the}} house, {{her father and}} Mr. Heddegan {{immediately}} at her back. Her mother had been so didactic that <b>she</b> had <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> absolutely unable to broach {{the subjects in the}} centre of her mind.|$|R
60|$|And {{suddenly}} <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> being {{propelled by}} that softness forward towards the stile.|$|E
60|$|His words {{disturbed}} her. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> {{being drawn}} {{under the shadow}} of some mystery.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> very candid, but {{why would}} Aunt Jane look at those {{tell-tale}} cheeks.|$|E
60|$|Still he {{was very}} easy to drive, and he went along so pleasantly, without needing the whip in the least, that Mrs. Cliff said to herself, {{that for the first}} time since her return <b>she</b> really <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> a rich woman.|$|R
60|$|The haughty {{young lady}} also blushed. She did not often blush; when <b>she</b> did, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> angry with <b>herself.</b>|$|R
60|$|She smiled sadly, as if <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> {{alone in}} <b>herself.</b> He caressed her cheek with his fingers, and kissed her.|$|R
60|$|Maruja did not {{lift her}} eyes. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> breathlessly {{hanging on the}} speaker's next words.|$|E
60|$|Helen's blood ran cold; terror {{held her}} voiceless. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> sinking slowly {{down upon the}} leaves.|$|E
60|$|Once {{more the}} firm grip had seized her waist. This time <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> {{powerless}} to struggle.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> stopt, <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> {{getting into}} a puzzle, {{and could not be}} prevailed on to add another word, not by dint of several minutes of supplication and waiting. He then {{returned}} to his former station, and went on as if there had been no such tender interruption.|$|R
6000|$|She {{was about}} to add that <b>she</b> hardly <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> excusable in having {{complied}} with it; but upon looking at the person whom she addressed, she was struck dumb by the singular and agitated expression of his countenance, and interrupted herself to exclaim, [...] "For God's sake, what is the matter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] The man disappeared, {{and after}} another {{interval}} Adeline came in. She showed the trepidation <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> at finding <b>herself</b> {{in the presence}} of an interviewer.|$|R
60|$|And {{along with}} these foreigners, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> being ironed into glossy mediocrity, and she rebelled, in fear.|$|E
60|$|She had {{the price}} in her hands, but <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> tempted to do as Judas did--to go out and hang herself.|$|E
6000|$|The cheering {{brightness}} round her, contrasting {{with the}} black gloom outside, restored her spirits. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> enjoying the light like a child! ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> had <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> to be unconquerable, even unattainable, and Caligula, {{before this}} mad frenzy had fully seized hold of him, had--in his own brutish way--indulged her in this, {{allowing}} her to lead her own life and secretly laughing at the machinations that went on around him to obtain the most coveted matrimonial prize in Rome.|$|R
60|$|Then it {{was that}} <b>she</b> had <b>felt</b> unseen hands {{snatching}} {{her out of the}} tumbril, <b>she</b> had <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> being dragged through that yelling crowd to a place where there was silence and darkness and where she knew that she was safe: thence she was conveyed--she hardly realised how--to England, where she and her brother and Jeanne and Hector, their faithful servants, had found refuge for over twenty years.|$|R
6000|$|She {{went on with}} an {{impulsive}} rapidity. O'thodoxy {{had always}} 'ipelled her,--always. <b>She</b> had <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> confronted by the most insurmountable difficulties, and yet whenever she had gone away from Christianity--she had gone away from Christianity, to the Theosophists and the Christian Scientists--she had <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> was only [...] "st'aying fu'tha." [...] And then suddenly when he was speaking last night, <b>she</b> had <b>felt</b> he knew. It was so wonderful to hear the [...] "k'eed was only a symbol." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, let me go--let me go!--to his mother!" [...] she wailed piteously, for <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> to be {{helpless}} in the youth's strong grasp.|$|E
6000|$|As {{he paused}} for a reply, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> bound to say something. [...] "Oh, yes, I do," [...] she said,--"as well as anybody else." ...|$|E
6000|$|Gyp got up; <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> {{being carried}} into {{the mood of}} the girl's heart, and was afraid it would be seen. Daphne Wing went on: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I couldn't {{think such}} a thing of you. I--I don't know what I meant. I meant that----" [...] She could not go on and say that <b>she</b> had <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> more worthy of him because of her father's money; {{it would not have}} been true; yet there was no other explanation. She stopped, and cast a {{helpless}} glance at him.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Merrifield {{was rather}} shocked, but <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>she</b> <b>herself</b> {{was in a}} glass house, was, in fact, keeping a {{literary}} daughter, so she only committed herself to, 'She is very young.' ...|$|R
60|$|She {{could not}} understand, then nor thereafter, {{the ferocity of}} hate which went out against the poor defenseless woman. What had the woman done? She {{struggled}} over the problem. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> in <b>herself</b> that terrible ceaseless urging. Her thoughts were not clear, they were still only raised figures in the web of organic thought, but she was accomplishing great conceptions.|$|R
60|$|The {{unblemished}} {{reputation of}} the bedroom was dear to Emily, in her capacity of queen. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> humiliated {{in the presence of}} the new pupil.|$|E
60|$|In {{her present}} mood this struck her only as {{persistent}} and somewhat egotistical. But <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> now on ground {{where she could}} deal firmly with him.|$|E
6000|$|This was, to Catherine's sense, a vivid picture, {{and though}} she disapproved, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> gazing at it. [...] "Where did you see him?" [...] she asked presently.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} come to her sooner!" [...] he confessed. [...] "I {{knew that she had}} not been well the week before; but I thought her slight attack was from the stomach. How could I dream of this! She assured me that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> like <b>herself,</b> and the morning of my {{birthday}}"--he hesitated--"the morning of my birthday I was compelled to go to the bishop." ...|$|R
60|$|At the {{appointed}} time, Bertha joined the party below. Her eyes looked heavy and {{her cheeks were}} flushed, but she assured Miss Haverley that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> quite <b>herself</b> now, {{and that she was}} sure that the sea air would set her up altogether. The schooner was under way {{a quarter of an hour}} before the gun was fired, and sailed east, as the course was twice round the Nab and back.|$|R
60|$|On {{that day}} Lady Julia {{returned}} to her own home. Her adieux to the whole family at Courcy Castle were very cold, but about Mr Crosbie and his lady-love at Allington she said no further word to any of them. Alexandrina did not show herself {{at all on the}} occasion, and indeed had not spoken to her enemy since that evening on which <b>she</b> had <b>felt</b> <b>herself</b> constrained to retreat from the drawing-room.|$|R
