50|$|In 2009 Dale joined Tank {{after being}} asked by friend and ex Rainbow singer, Doogie White, {{who had just}} joined the band himself. they would both be {{replacing}} singer/bassist, Algy Ward. Chris already knew guitarist Cliff Evans and original Tank drummer, Mark Brabbs, who had rejoined the newly reformed band. After several festival slots that <b>summer,</b> <b>Tank</b> went on to release War Machine in 2010 and are currently working on War Nation, set for a mid-2012 release.|$|E

50|$|He {{made his}} {{literary}} debut in 1993 with the poetry collection Den sumaren eg fylte diesel ("The <b>Summer</b> I <b>Tanked</b> with Diesel"). He later {{made his way}} as a humorist. The books Arne Hjeltnes ser på 549 TV-heltar and Når skaldyret vaknar followed in 1994 and 1995. In 1996 came Den vanvittige korte veien til rikdom og suksess, written with Roger Nielman.|$|R
50|$|The city {{residents}} rely on hand pumps and motors for water. The shortage of water made the municipality to take certain measures like, providing new pipelines, construction of two <b>summer</b> storage <b>tanks</b> with {{a capacity of}} 1,686 million litres and 634 million litres etc. The municipality provides 87 litres of water per head everyday. The other works such as, sewage, internal drainage system and road margins are also taken by the authorities.|$|R
50|$|To {{dovetail}} {{with the}} City of Lancaster’s energy initiatives, MOAH staff developed the Green MOAH initiative in 2013, a creative {{program designed to}} better align Museum projects with the City’s goal of 100% renewable energy usage by 2020. The Green MOAH initiative includes the award-winning Wasteland Project, STEAM inspired Crosswinds Project, Green Revolution Traveling Trunk, the 2016 Green Revolution exhibition and a youth <b>summer</b> think <b>tank,</b> presented {{in partnership with the}} Land Art Generator Initiative (LAGI).|$|R

In 1969, the Fierlingers settled in Philadelphia, where he was hired by Concept Films to animate political commercials for Hubert Humphrey and other political candidates. In 1971, a second son, Peter, was born.|$|R
30|$|The fusion-based {{learning}} {{method is}} proposed to obtain correlations, especially the implicit patterns, between the preference of consumer and their periodical purchase. Most {{of the cases}} [36, 37] nowadays pay attentions on the discovery of user preference and further recommend potential products to the specific consumers so as to attract their interests. But this approach, however, faces to the user side. From the perspective of provider side (i.e., the company in this study), {{it is better to}} achieve comprehensive understanding of the cycle of purchase in order to present appropriate products to their consumers. For instance, a company will never sell heavy jacket in <b>summer,</b> or <b>tank</b> shirt in winter. What actions the company may take is to avoid unnecessary expenses (e.g., number of stocks, etc.) by prediction.|$|R
50|$|Mohforce left {{near the}} end of <b>summer,</b> with two <b>tanks</b> in front of the leading troops which could be used to outflank tribesman who pinned down the infantry. The tanks were Vickers Mark IIB, with a single Vickers machine gun. They did not have their radios, which had been {{withdrawn}} for their annual overhaul, so one tank had to act as a “runner” between the tanks and the infantry. The Mohmands, having no word for tanks, called them “the snakes that spit”.|$|R

50|$|The Ironton Tanks {{originally}} {{played in}} Beechwood Stadium but following through on local enthusiasm a stadium fund was created and Tank Stadium {{was built in}} 1926. This stadium still stands today and is being used by Ironton High School. It {{is one of the}} last covered stadiums in use for high school football today. The stadium was later renamed to Tanks Memorial Stadium, the name in use to the present day. In 2009, the field at Tanks Memorial Stadium was given the additional name of Bob Lutz Field in honor of long-time Ironton head coach Bob Lutz. During the <b>summer</b> of 2014, <b>Tank</b> Memorial Stadium's playing surface was upgraded to Field Turf.|$|R
2500|$|During {{the summer}} of 1940, both the British public and the Americans {{believed}} that a German invasion was imminent, and they studied the forthcoming high tides of 5–9 August, 2–7 September, 1–6 October, and 30 October-4 November as likely dates. The British prepared extensive defences, and, in Churchill's view, [...] "the great invasion scare" [...] was [...] "serving a most useful purpose" [...] by [...] "keeping every man and woman tuned to a high pitch of readiness". He did not think the threat credible. On 10 July, he advised the War Cabinet {{that the possibility of}} invasion could be ignored, as it [...] "would be a most hazardous and suicidal operation". That <b>summer,</b> Britain exported <b>tanks</b> to the campaign in Egypt.|$|R
50|$|As of January 1, 2012, TANK charges $1.50 for non-express routes, and $2 for express routes (marked with X {{at end of}} bus route). Students in Kindergarten through 12th grade {{on school}} days riding {{to and from school}} only have to pay $1. TANK also has passes: a monthly pass (unlimited) for $53, an express monthly pass (unlimited) for $70, a METRO/TANK monthly non-express pass (unlimited, METRO fare zone 1) for $105. The express {{combined}} pass is $115. Also, TANK has a 10 ride pass for $13.50, and a 10 ride express pass for $18. Beginning in <b>summer</b> of 2010 <b>TANK</b> upgraded their fare system and passes that were valid for a calendar month were replaced with passes good for 30 consecutive days from first use. Also, other pass options were introduced including a 1-day pass. For a complete list of fare options, click here.|$|R
50|$|Electricity {{supply to}} Virudhunagar is {{regulated}} and {{distributed by the}} Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB). The town and its suburbs forms the Virudhunagar Electricity Distribution Circle. A chief distribution engineer is stationed at the regional headquarters. Water supply is provided to the town by the Virudhunagar municipality from three sources, namely Anaikuttam, Karuseri Kalquarry and Sukkravarpatti <b>Summer</b> Storage <b>Tank.</b> During the period 2000-01, a total of 3.86 million litres of water was supplied every day to households in the town. About 35 metric tonnes of solid waste are collected from Virudhunagar every day by door-to-door collection. Subsequently, the sanitary department of the Virudhunagar municipality carries out the source segregation and dumping. The coverage of solid waste management had an efficiency of 100 per cent as of 2001. There is no underground drainage system in the town, and the sewerage system for disposal of sullage is through septic tanks, open drains and public conveniences. The municipality maintains stormwater drains on all municipal roads. There are 35 hospitals in the town, one siddha dispensary and two municipal maternity homes that {{take care of the}} healthcare needs of the citizens. There are a total of 2,875 street lamps in the town: 276 sodium lamps, five mercury vapour lamps, 2,592 tube lights and two high-mast beam lamps. The municipality operates three markets, namely, the Municipal Market, Uzhavar Santhai, and Virudhunagar Bazaar Market, that cater {{to the needs of the}} town and the surrounding rural areas.|$|R
500|$|The {{tank was}} {{powered by a}} T-26 [...] flat row 4-cylinder {{air-cooled}} petrol engine, which was a complete Soviet copy of the Armstrong Siddeley engine used in the Vickers 6-Ton. The engine was located in the rear part of the hull. Early Soviet-made tank engines were of bad quality but they became better beginning in 1934. The T-26 (Armstrong Siddeley) engine {{did not have an}} over-speed limiter, which often resulted in overheating and engine valve breakage, especially in <b>summer.</b> A fuel <b>tank</b> for [...] and an oil box for [...] were placed alongside the engine. The engine required top-grade petrol; the use of second-rate petrol could cause damage to the valve units because of engine detonation. From mid-1932, a more capacious fuel tank (290 L instead of 182 L) and a simplified oil box were introduced. An engine cooling fan was mounted over the engine in a special shroud. From early 1932, the exhaust silencer was affixed by three clamps instead of two.|$|R
40|$|Creeping bentgrass is {{seasonally}} stressed {{from high}} summer temperatures and high humidity {{conditions in the}} desert southwest from June to mid-September. Golf greens typically show decreased stand density and poor performance {{by the end of}} this time. A preventative fungicide application program was evaluated for the prevention of summer stress typical under <b>summer</b> conditions. Four <b>tank</b> mixes composed of Alliete Signature mixed with either Chipco 26019, EXP 10790 A, EXP 10702 B, or Daconil Ultrex fungicides were applied every fourteen days from June 10 to September 17, 1997, on a 'Penncross' creeping bentgrass green maintained at 5 / 32 ". The Daconil Ultrex tank mix caused some initial injury and in general, the lightest turfgrass color and the lowest turfgrass quality. EXP 10702 B treated turf produced, on average, the darkest turf with the leading rank score for quality. The Chipco 26019 tank mix produced the largest seasonal clipping totals, which was greater than the check. No diseases occurred on treated or untreated turf. Root dry weights in mid-October varied as much as 40 % among treatments, but was not statistically significant...|$|R
40|$|In This Issue: Postemergence Weed Control in Corn Algae and Moss Control in Water <b>Tanks</b> <b>Summer</b> Hours Combination Herbicides- What’s in A Name? Postemergence Weed Control in Corn Some of {{our early}} planted corn {{is ready for}} postemergence weed control. Suggestions for {{effective}} control include the following: When using atrazine with oil, annual grasses are best controlled when less than 1 1 / 22 ̆ 2 tall. Bladex 80 W or 90 DF {{can also be used}} postemergence but omit the oil. Tandem in combination with atrazine or Bladex increases postemergence activity. Bladex should be used when corn is 42 ̆ 2 or less. Apply Marksman when corn is under 52 ̆ 2. Buctril or Brominal alone or in combination with atrazine should be applied when most broadleaf weeds are under 62 ̆ 2. Laddok should also be used before broadleaf weeds reach 62 ̆ 2. Use drop nozzles when applying Banvel or 2, 4 -D to taller corn. Observe all label cautions on crop heights, rates, and safety to nearby crops, gardens, and windbreaks...|$|R
40|$|Cross-breeding was {{investigated}} {{as a strategy}} to improve performance of the Australian native freshwater fish, silver perch (Bidyanus bidyanus Mitchell) through the exploitation of heterosis during the fingerling phase of production. Growth, and mid and best parent heterosis of two wild strains, Cataract Dam (C♂× C♀) and Murray River (M♂× M♀) and their reciprocal crosses (C♂× M♀ and M♂× C♀) were evaluated in cages and ponds through <b>summer,</b> and in <b>tanks</b> in a re-circulating aquaculture system during winter. The M × C cross grew significantly faster than the reciprocal cross and pure strains in cages and tanks, had the lowest coefficients of variation of weight and length and was 20. 9 % and 16. 0 % heavier than mid-parent and best-parent average, respectively, when grown in ponds. Differences in growth between the reciprocal crosses were also evident, with C × M expressing significantly less heterosis in cages and tanks. Faster growth of M × C was attributed to greater appetite; however, at sizes approaching 250 g this feeding vigour diminished. The {{results of this study}} suggest that use of the M × C cross has the potential to reduce the length of the culture period and lower costs of silver perch production...|$|R
50|$|A simple {{example is}} a garden water tank. This is being topped up by {{rainfall}} from the roof, but when the tank is full, the remaining water goes to the drain. When the gardener draws water off, the level falls. If the garden is large and the summer is hot, a steady state will occur in <b>summer</b> where the <b>tank</b> is nearly always empty in summer. If the season is wet, the garden is getting water from the sky, and the tank is not being emptied sufficiently, so in steady state it will be observed to be always full. If the gardener {{has a way of}} observing the level of water in the tank, and a record of daily rainfall and temperatures, and is precisely metering the amount of water being drawn off every day, the numbers and the dates can be recorded in spreadsheet at daily intervals. After enough samples are taken, a chart can be developed to model the rise and fall pattern over a year, or over 2 years. With {{a better understanding of the}} process, it might emerge that a 200litre water tank would run out 20-25 days a year, but a 400-litre water tank would never run out, and a 300-litre tank would run out only 1-2 day a year and therefore that would be an acceptable risk and it would be the most economical solution.|$|R
40|$|Tank 50 H is {{the feed}} tank for the Saltstone Production Facility (SPF). In the <b>summer</b> of 2011, <b>Tank</b> 50 H {{contained}} two standard slurry pumps and two quad volute slurry pumps. Current requirements for mixing operation {{is to run}} three pumps for one hour prior to initiating a feed transfer to SPF. Savannah River Site (SRS) Liquid Waste moved both of the Quad Volute pumps from Tank 50 H to Tank 51 H to replace pumps in Tank 51 H that were failing. In addition, one of the standard pumps in Tank 50 H exhibits high seal leakage and vibration. SRS Liquid Waste requested Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) to conduct a study to evaluate the feasibility of mixing the contents of Tank 50 H with one to three standard slurry pumps. To determine the pump requirements to mix solids with liquids in Tank 50 H, the author reviewed the pilot-scale blending work performed for the Small Column Ion Exchange Process (SCIX), SRNL computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling, Tank 50 H operating experience, and the technical literature, and applied the results to Tank 50 H to determine the number, size, and operating parameters of pumps needed to mix the solid particles with the liquid in Tank 50 H. The analysis determined pump requirements to suspend the solids with no 'dead zones', but did not determine the pump requirements to produce a homogeneous suspension. In addition, the analysis determined the pump requirements to prevent the accumulation of {{a large amount of}} solid particles under the telescoping transfer pump. The conclusions from this analysis follow: (1) The analysis shows that three Quad Volute pumps should be able to suspend the solid particles expected ({approx} 0. 6 g/L insoluble solids, {approx} 5 micron) in Tank 50 H. (2) Three standard slurry pumps {{may not be able to}} suspend the solid particles in Tank 50 H; (3) The ability of two Quad Volute pumps to fully suspend all of the solid particles in Tank 50 H is marginal; and (4) One standard slurry pump should be able to achieve a cleaning radius larger than 43. 5 feet, which will prevent large amounts of solid particles from settling under the telescoping transfer pump (TTP). The report recommends a pump operating approach to maximize the achieved cleaning radius...|$|R
