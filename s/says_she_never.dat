2500|$|When Neff {{learns that}} Keyes {{suspects}} Nino of being Phyllis' accomplice, Neff sees {{a way out}} of his predicament. He arranges to meet Phyllis at her house. He informs her that he knows about her involvement with Nino, and guesses that she is planning to have Nino kill him. He tells her that he intends to kill her and put the blame on Nino. She is prepared, however, and shoots him in the shoulder. Seriously wounded but still standing, he slowly comes closer and dares her to shoot again. She does not, and he takes the gun from her. She <b>says</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> loved him [...] "until a minute ago, when I couldn't fire that second shot." [...] Neff does not believe a word she says, and as she hugs him tightly, Neff says, [...] "Goodbye, baby," [...] and shoots twice, killing her.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} act, word {{comes to the}} {{department}} store owner Edward Gilder {{that one of his}} former sales clerks, Mary Turner, has been convicted for stealing and given a three-year prison sentence. Gilder is pleased because he had asked the judge to make her an [...] "example" [...] to other employees. Turner asks to speak with Gilder before she goes to prison. While Gilder waits for her arrival, his store detective detains another woman, a customer, for stealing. This woman is the wife of a prominent banker, so rather than have her arrested, Gilder apologizes to her and lets her go. Turner arrives and tells Gilder she has been wrongly convicted. Although she <b>says</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> stole, she pleads with Gilder to increase the wages of his clerks, so no one who works there will be forced to steal. Gilder rejects her arguments, and she leaves for prison swearing revenge on him for his treatment of her.|$|E

"Davy," [...] he said passionately, [...] "Davy, you mustn't {{mind what}} she <b>says.</b> <b>She</b> <b>never</b> means {{anything}} she says--she never cares for anything save her pleasure.

6000|$|When a woman <b>says</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> {{will forgive}} a man, she {{always has a}} {{condition}} of forgiveness in her heart. Now that the wind had risen again, [...] "I {{have no right to}} forbid you to speak," [...] she said, as if no silence had elapsed, and she turned round and quietly confronted him; she no longer felt so impatient to escape.|$|E

5000|$|... "But Justice Department {{officials}} said Democrats were misreading the memorandum, and they quoted the F.B.I. agent {{in a follow-up}} discussion as saying he did not recall any meetings with Ms. Fisher at which the treatment of detainees at Guantánamo Bay was discussed. Ms. Fisher and the Justice Department <b>say</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> took part in such meetings," [...] Lichtblau wrote.|$|R

I think a truly perfect person would be very uninteresting. Mrs. Milton White <b>says</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> met a perfect person, but she's heard enough about one [...] . her husband's first wife. Don't you think it must be very uncomfortable {{to be married to}} a man whose first wife was perfect?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The 'elf' is flourishing in {{all good}} fairyhood, with a scarlet rose leaf on each cheek. Wilson <b>says</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> knew {{him to have}} such an {{irreproachable}} appetite. He is charmed with Paris, and its magnificent Punches, and roundabouts, and balloons--which last he says, looking up after them gravely, 'go to God.' The child has curious ideas about theology already. He is of opinion that God 'lives among the birds.' He has taken to calling himself 'Peninni,'[3] which sounds something like a fairy's name, though he means it for 'Wiedeman.' ...|$|E
50|$|Giulio's mother {{takes him}} to the doctor who tells him he'll {{have to be in}} a cast for several weeks. Arianna comes over to his place to help him mend, but when he starts telling her what {{happened}} and his theory of how Federica wants Sasha to kill her boss, Arianna says he's crazier than ever and storms out, <b>saying</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> wants to see him again.|$|R

[...] muttered Bill, in a stricken voice. [...] "She <b>says</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> realised before she sang it to-night how hollow New York was. She said it suddenly came over her.

6000|$|Clarence and Martyn {{walked over}} to Hillside {{the first thing the}} next morning to inquire for the two sisters. As to one, they were quickly reassured, for Anne was in the porch feeding the doves, and no sooner did she see them than out she flew, and was {{clinging}} round Martyn's neck, her hat falling back as she kissed him on both cheeks, with an eagerness that made him, as Clarence reported, turn the colour of a lobster, and look shy, not to say sheepish, while she exclaimed, ' Oh, Martyn! mamma <b>says</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> thanked you, for you really and truly did save my life, and I am so glad it was you-- ' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Her {{selfishness}} does {{but little}} harm," [...] returned Dunwoodie. [...] "One of her greatest difficulties is her aversion to the blacks. <b>She</b> <b>says</b> that <b>she</b> <b>never</b> saw but one she liked." ...|$|R

60|$|No {{doubt the}} whole family (except the yet {{unconfirmed}} younger brother) did so receive it in the summer holidays, the last that were to be spent in the full joy of an unbroken household circle, and, as has been already said, one of unusual warmth and kindliness, binding closely into it all who were connected therewith. Each governess became a dear friend; the servants were deeply attached, {{and for the most}} part fixtures; and one, the nurse already mentioned, <b>says</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> recollects a time when Master Coley had to leave Feniton for London without his offering the servants to take charge of their messages or parcels. All dependents and poor people, in fact whatever came under Judge Patteson's genial, broad-hearted influence, were treated with the like kindness, and everything alive about the place seemed full of happiness and affection.|$|E
6000|$|The ladies {{were in a}} garden, {{where they}} were {{consulting}} with the gardener and Father Coleman about the shape of some new beds, for the critical hour of filling them was approaching. The gardener, like all head-gardeners, was opinionated. Living always at Vauxe, {{he had come to}} believe that the gardens belonged to him, and that the family were only occasional visitors; and he treated them accordingly. The lively and impetuous Lady St. Jerome had a thousand bright fancies, but her morose attendant never indulged them. She used to deplore his tyranny with piteous playfulness. [...] "I suppose," [...] she would say, [...] "it is useless to resist, for I observe 'tis the same everywhere. Lady Roehampton <b>says</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> has her way with her gardens. It is no use speaking to Lord St. Jerome, for, though he is afraid of nothing else, I am sure he is afraid of Hawkins." ...|$|E

50|$|Also {{believe to}} haunted at Haden Hill House is {{the ghost of}} Annie Eliza (1790-1876) who lived alone. Reports <b>say</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> married or had children. She {{turned out to be}} the last of the Hadens in the direct family line. There have been many Evps (Electronic Voice Phenomena) of a female spirit {{captured}} in the Tudor part of the house. Questions are asked if this is the ghost of Annie Eliza trying to communicate.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I {{ought to}} go," [...] Peter {{had told me}} mournfully, [...] "but we won't have turkey for dinner, because ma can't afford it. And ma always cries on {{holidays}} because <b>she</b> <b>says</b> they make her think of father. Of course she can't help it, but it ain't cheerful. Aunt Jane wouldn't have cried. Aunt Jane used to <b>say</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> saw {{the man who was}} worth spoiling her eyes for. But I guess I'll have to spend Christmas at home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course. Why, little babies {{must have}} smaller ones than big men. Well, it's getting dark and I must scoot home. Mrs. Elliott doesn't {{like me to}} be out after dark. Laws, when I lived with Mrs. Wiley the dark was {{just the same as}} the {{daylight}} to me. I didn't mind it no more'n a gray cat. Them days seem a hundred years ago. Now, you mind what I've said and try to behave yourselves, for you pa's sake. I'LL always back you up and defend you--you can be dead sure of that. Mrs. Elliott <b>says</b> <b>she</b> <b>never</b> saw the like of me for sticking up for my friends. I was real sassy to Mrs. Alec Davis about you and Mrs. Elliott combed me down for it afterwards. The fair Cornelia has a tongue of her own and no mistake. But she was pleased underneath for all, 'cause she hates old Kitty Alec and she's real fond of you. I can see through folks." ...|$|E

Perhaps she has forgotten, just as she sometimes forgets your name and calls you Mildred, which is your mother's name. Still, she could hardly forget such an important thing as the goat. Therefore there was no goat when your grandmother was a little girl. This shows that, in telling the story of Peter Pan, to begin with the goat (as most people do) is as silly as to put on your jacket before your vest.|$|E
