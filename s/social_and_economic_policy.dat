5|$|The {{decisions}} reached {{during this}} period vary, however, mostly due to the differing judicial philosophies of the time. While A.V. Dicey maintained that the prevalent philosophy was one of laissez faire thanks {{to the influence of}} philosophers and economists such as Adam Smith, Michael W. Flinn asserted that: Another common error... has been the assumption that the classical economists were the only effective influence on <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> <b>policy</b> in the early and mid-nineteenth century. This is a curiously perverse view, since it ignores powerful voices like those of Bentham, Chadwick, the social novelists, many by no means inarticulate members of the medical profession, the humanitarians, the Christian Socialists and most sections of the many working class movements. There was in short, nothing approaching a consensus of opinion concerning laissez-faire and state intervention, even in the very narrow social sector represented by governments, Parliament, and the press. In practice the ears of ministers were assaulted by a confused babble of voices rather than bewitched by the soft whisper of a single plea for inaction.|$|E

After The Fair Minimum Wage Act was signed, Donnelly said in a statement that, “A decent wage is essential for a working family to get by in America.

2500|$|According to the WHO, {{type and}} {{structure}} of governments and their <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> <b>policy</b> more deeply affects {{the health of the}} impoverished than other populations. Every component of government- from finance, education, housing, employment, transportation, and health policy- affects population health and health equity. Life expectancy variation between countries can be partially attributed to the type of political regime, whether that be fascist, communist, conservative, or social-democratic. However, changing the status of government regime does not always end the type of policies in place, as seen in South Africa. The end of South Africa's apartheid regime has still not dismantled the structures of inequality and oppression, which has led the persistent social inequality to perpetuate the spread of HIV, diminishing population health. Also, the political economy, encompassing production organization, physical infrastructure, and political institutions [...] play a large role in determining health inequalities.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{scholars}} have linked the ascent of neoliberal, free market ideology {{in the late}} 1970s to mass incarceration. Sociologist Loïc Wacquant postulates the expansive prison system has become a political institution designed {{to deal with an}} urban crisis created by welfare state retrenchment and economic deregulation, and that this [...] "overgrown and intrusive penal state" [...] is [...] "deeply injurious to the ideals of democratic citizenship." [...] Academic and activist Angela Davis argues that prisons in the U.S. have [...] "become venues of profit as well as punishment;" [...] as mass incarceration has increased, the prison system has become more about economic factors than criminality. Professor of Law at Columbia University Bernard Harcourt contends that neoliberalism holds the state as incompetent when it comes to economic regulation but proficient at policing and punishing, and that this paradox has resulted in the expansion of penal confinement. According to The Routledge Handbook of Poverty in the United States, [...] "neoliberal <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> <b>policy</b> has more deeply embedded the carceral state within the lives of the poor, transforming {{what it means to be}} poor in America." ...|$|E
2500|$|Like slavery, {{common law}} {{repression}} of labor unions {{was slow to}} be undone. In 1806, Commonwealth v Pullis held that a Philadelphia shoemakers union striking for higher wages was an illegal [...] "conspiracy", even though corporations - combinations of employers - were lawful. Unions still formed and acted. The first federation of unions, the National Trades Union was established in 1834 to achieve a 10 hour working day, {{but it did not}} survive the soaring unemployment from the financial Panic of 1837. In 1842, Commonwealth v Hunt, held that Pullis was wrong, after the Boston Journeymen Bootmakers’ Society struck for higher wages. The first instance judge said unions would [...] "render property insecure, and make it the spoil of the multitude, would annihilate property, and involve society in a common ruin". But in the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, Shaw CJ held people [...] "are free to work for whom they please, or not to work, if they so prefer" [...] and could [...] "agree together to exercise their own acknowledged rights, in such a manner as best to subserve their own interests." [...] This stopped criminal cases, although civil cases persisted. In 1869 an organisation called the Knights of Labor was founded by Philadelphia artisans, joined by miners 1874, and urban tradesmen from 1879. It aimed for racial and gender equality, political education and cooperative enterprise, yet it supported the Alien Contract Labor Law of 1885 which suppressed workers migrating to the US under a contract of employment. Industrial conflicts on railroads and telegraphs from 1883 led to the foundation of the American Federation of Labor in 1886, with the simple aim of improving workers wages, housing and job security [...] "here and now". It also aimed to be the sole federation, to create a strong, unified labor movement. Business reacted with litigation. The Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, which was intended to sanction business cartels acting in restraint of trade, was applied to labor unions. In 1895, the US Supreme Court in In re Debs affirmed an injunction, based on the Sherman Act, against the striking workers of the Pullman Company. [...] The strike leader Eugene Debs was put in prison. In notable dissent among the judiciary, Holmes J argued in Vegelahn v Guntner that any union taking collective action in good faith was lawful: even if strikes caused economic loss, this was equally legitimate as economic loss from corporations competing with one another. Holmes J was elevated to the US Supreme Court, but was again in a minority on labor rights. In 1905, Lochner v New York held that New York limiting bakers' working day to 60 hours a week violated employers' [...] "freedom of contract". The Supreme Court majority supposedly unearthed this [...] "right" [...] in the Fourteenth Amendment, that no State should [...] "deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law." [...] With Harlan J, Holmes J dissented, arguing that the [...] "constitution is not intended to embody a particular economic theory" [...] but is [...] "made for people of fundamentally differing views". On questions of <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> <b>policy,</b> courts should never declare legislation [...] "unconstitutional". The Supreme Court, however, accelerated its attack on labor in Loewe v. Lawlor, holding that triple damages were payable by a striking union to its employers under the Sherman Act of 1890. This line of cases was finally quashed by the Clayton Act of 1914 §6. This removed labor from antitrust law, affirming that the [...] "labor of a human being is not a commodity or article of commerce" [...] and nothing [...] "in the antitrust laws" [...] would forbid the operation of labor organizations [...] "for the purposes of mutual help".|$|E
