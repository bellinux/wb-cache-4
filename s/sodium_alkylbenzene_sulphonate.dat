40|$|The {{effect of}} low {{frequency}} (20 kHz) ultrasonic irradiation on {{the removal of}} <b>sodium</b> Linear <b>Alkylbenzene</b> <b>Sulphonates</b> (LAS) from aqueous solutions has been investigated. Sonication of three different initial concentrations of LAS, 500 Î¼gmol/l, 750 Î¼gmol/l and 1000 Î¼gmol/l, were performed. All experiments used a temperature of 30 Â°C, frequency of 20 kHz, power of 125 W, a batch time of 120 min and the pH was left uncontrolled. It {{was found that the}} main degradation of LAS at micromolar concentrations proceeded via a reaction with OHÂ· radicals. The initial degradation rate increased with an increase in the surfactant concentration over the whole concentration range studied. The sonolysis of LAS showed a strong inhibition of H 2 O 2 production at a higher concentration. Sonication of LAS in the presence of BrÂ¯ suggested that OHÂ· radicals induced degradation pathway was the dominating sonochemical degradation mechanism. ...|$|R

Free ammonia concentrations decreased more slowly than LAS and remained above the level believed to be toxic for sensitive aquatic species along the entire channel. Changes in the ratios of LAS alkyl chain homologues to total LAS concentrations suggest a preferential removal of longer chain lengths.

All determinations were carried out using a multiresidue analytical approach, based on the application of gas chromatographic and liquid chromatographic techniques coupled to mass spectrometric detection. The results confirmed a widespread occurrence of the emerging contaminants in municipal wastewaters of the region.

30|$|Calculation of log Kow/D for the {{majority}} of anionic surfactants, e.g. <b>alkylbenzene</b> <b>sulphonates,</b> alkyl sulphates, using the H&L approach with a variety of surfactant specific modifications has been widely researched and validated. When compared to this approach, CLOGP appears to give consistently higher log Kow values for the sulphate-containing surfactants. This is due to the lower fragment value used for the sulphate fragment (−[*] 2.17 cf. −[*] 5.87 in H&L method). KOWWIN and Broto both scored highly when considering R 2 alone with values of 0.999 for both methods (Additional file 4 : Table S 7). Whilst ALOGP predictions also appear consistently high for selected compounds in this class, using the MAE measure of predictivity, ALOGP ranked by far the best when considering magnitude of the error with an MAE value of 0.16 (Additional file 4 : Table S 8) followed by Molinspiration, KOWWIN and H&L with modifications (with MAE values of 0.46, 0.83 and 1.06, respectively). When taking into account the threshold approach also, in which only the ALOGP method scores as a moderate predictor compared to poor/bad scoring for all other methods (Additional file 4 : Table S 9), ALOGP is consistently better for predicting log Kow/D for anionic surfactants based on this small dataset. Molinspiration, KOWWIN and H&L with modifications would be next recommended methods for anionics based on MAE scores (Tables  5 and Additional file 4 : Table S 8).|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{possible}} {{contamination of}} the environment by surfactants arising from the widespread use of detergent formulations has been reviewed. Two of the major surfactants in current use are the linear <b>alkylbenzene</b> <b>sulphonates</b> (LAS) and the alkyl phenol ethoxylates (APE). These pass into the sewage treatment plants where they are partially aerobically degraded and partially adsorbed to sewage sludge that is applied to land. The biodegradation of these and a range of other surfactants both in wastewater treatment plants and after discharge into natural waters and application to land resulting in sewage sludge amended soils has been considered. Although the application of sewage sludge to soil can result in surfactant levels generally in a range 0 to 3 mg kg− 1, in the aerobic soil environment a surfactant can undergo further degradation so that the risk to the biota in soil is very small, with margins of safety that are often at least 100. In the case of APE, while the surfactants themselves show little toxicity their breakdown products, principally nonyl and octyl phenols adsorb readily to suspended solids and are known to exhibit oestrogen-like properties, possibly linked to a decreasing male sperm count and carcinogenic effects. While there is little serious risk to the environment from commonly used anionic surfactants, cationic surfactants are known to be much more toxic and at present {{there is a lack of}} data on the degradation of cationics and their fate in the environment...|$|R
40|$|Surfactants (surface active agent) is a {{chemical}} compound used for reduce the surface {{tension of the}} liquid. Surfactants are divided into four groups: anionic, nonionic, cationic and amphoteric. The most widely used surfactant is an anionic surfactant which is synthesized from petroleum namely Linear <b>Alkylbenzene</b> <b>sulphonate</b> (LABS). LABS is not resistant to high salinity levels, not degradable, expensive and still imported. Methyl Ester Sulfonate is an anionic surfactant which is currently being developed. These surfactants can be produced from palm oil methyl ester. MES produced from sulfonation reaction with addition of sulfonate. Sulfonate used in this research using sodium metabisulphite. The aims synthesize surfactant Methyl Ester Sulfonate of Palm Oil Methyl Ester usingSodium Metabisulphite and a catalyst Calcium Oxide, and to {{study the effects of}} time and the mole ratio of the product produced. Palm Oil Methyl Ester obtained from PT. Cemerlang Eka Perkasa Dumai, Riau Province. Sulfonation process carried out at the time variation of 4, 5, 6 hours, the mole ratio of 1 : 0, 5, 1 : 1, 1 : 1, 5, temperature of 80 ° C and the stirring speed of 450 rpm. The density of MES (0. 89490 g/cm 3 - 0. 89545 g/cm 3), viscosity (2. 0323 cP - 2. 1329 cP), a pH (2, 03 - 2, 48), surface tension (32. 60 mN/m - 33. 60 mN/m), interfacial tension (30. 45 mN/m - 30. 94 mN/m), and the stability emulsion (59. 17 % - 89, 17 %) ...|$|R

Turbulent drag reduction (DR) efficiency of Sodium Polystyrene Sulfonate (NaPSS) <b>sodium</b> <b>Alkylbenzene</b> sulfonate complex was studied in a rotating disk apparatus. The solution complex was prepared by varying the concentration of the polymer between 100 to 1200 ppm and the surfactant between 100 to 700 ppm. Measurement of torque values were recorded for each sample. The NaPSS (Sodium Polystyrene Sulfante) {{was found to have}} an ability to reduce the drag in the turbulent flow. A significant improvement was recorded for the addition of tiny amount of surfactant to the polymer system compare to the pure polymer drag reduction. At high surfactant concentration, {{it was found that the}} polymer drag ability decrease. The polymer was degraded when it is subjected to a high shear stress. The degredation resistance was increased by the addation of the surfactant to the polymer solution at concentration range of 100 ppm to 400 ppm of surfactan...|$|R
