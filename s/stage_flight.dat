40|$|Nowadays a big {{challenge}} in aviation {{is represented by the}} scarcity of fossil fuels. Hence, {{there is a need for}} a more fuel efficient air transport system. A possible innovation is a change in operating mode. Conceptual design studies showed <b>staged</b> <b>flight</b> operations to be up to 40 % more fuel efficient than non-stop operations. <b>Staged</b> <b>flight</b> operation uses extra stops to split up long range missions. An even more novel concept is in-flight refueling operation (IFR). IFR incorporates a fuel transfer system in midair. This eliminates the increase in travel time, which is associated with the extra take-off and landings of <b>staged</b> <b>flight</b> operations, while maintaining similar fuel saving as <b>staged</b> <b>flight</b> operations. This thesis focuses on the design of the cruiser, the passenger aircraft that will be refueled. The design of the tanker and of the whole operational concept are outside the scope of the thesis. The design of the cruiser is performed with the Initiator, an automated design tool. The modifications to the Initiator to enable it to produce an accurate design of the cruiser are described in the thesis. The cruiser was found to have a higher payload range efficiency (PRE) as the non-stop aircraft. 10. 4 % better than the 5000 nm non-stop aircraft and 29. 4 % better than the 7500 nm non-stop aircraft. Top level requirements of existing aircraft were used to produce concepts with similar payload requirements (B 767 - 300 payload= 26500 kg) and with similar range requirements (B 737 - 800 range= 2500 nm). They were outperformed by 7. 3 % and 9. 6 % in PRE, when operated with similar passenger comfort levels as the cruiser. Since only the cruiser design is considered no exact conclusions on the fuel savings can be given. Only a fuel budget can be provided for tanker operations. Comparing tanker fuel consumptions from literature 9 of 12 tanker designs outperformed the <b>staged</b> <b>flight</b> operation, 12 of 12 the non-stop operations. In-flight has to be further researched, however initial studies show IFR can be a possible solution for a more fuel efficient air transport. The cruiser outperformed existing aircraft for the given range of 2500 nm. FFPAerospace Engineerin...|$|R

50|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, SA-3 was {{the first}} Apollo flight to carry a full load of propellant, compared to earlier flights that carried approximately 83% of maximum capacity. This {{had the effect of}} testing the rocket's reaction to slower acceleration and extended first <b>stage</b> <b>flight</b> time. Also on this mission, the outboard engines were allowed to fire until depletion of the rocket's liquid oxygen (LOX), rather than the timed cut-offs of previous flights.|$|E
50|$|The launch went {{perfectly}} {{except for}} a few seconds of Pogo oscillation (axial vibration of the rocket). This was measured at +0.38 g (3.7 m/s²) during first <b>stage</b> <b>flight,</b> exceeding the permitted +0.25 g (2.5 m/s²) for a total of about 13 seconds. Conrad and Cooper found their vision and speech momentarily impaired by the strong vibrations. The cause was traced to improper gas levels in an oxidizer standpipe, and severe oscillations did not affect any subsequent Gemini flights. The initial orbit was 101x216 miles (163x349 kilometers).|$|E

How migratory birds divide their time between flight and stopover {{is still not}} well known. Short-term recoveries of passerine birds ringed in Sweden were analysed to investigate how far long-distance migrating passerines fly during a <b>flight</b> <b>stage</b> and whether they migrate one or more <b>flight</b> <b>stages</b> in a row. Included {{in the study were}} birds recovered at least 50 km from the ringing site and within seven days from ringing. The median distance covered by the recovered birds was 245 km. About 40 % of the recoveries within 24 hours from ringing were found at least 200 km from the ringing site. The distances covered varied and many birds moved only short distances, perhaps as a result of searching for good stopover sites, while others moved much further away. Two recoveries of Sedge Warblers three days after ringing indicated that these birds had flown three nights in a row before being controlled. The results suggest that long-distance passerine migrants regularly perform several <b>flight</b> <b>stages</b> in a row, with short rests in between, before refuelling, even if there are no major barriers ahead...|$|R
