30|$|Commercial {{microscope}} slide glass substrates (16 [*]×[*] 25 × 1  mm) {{were used as}} the substrate. The glass substrates were first ultrasonically cleaned in <b>sulfochromic</b> <b>acid</b> solution, washed with deionized water, isopropyl alcohol, and doubly distilled water, respectively, and dried in an oven at 90 °C for about 1  h. The thin films of CdTe QDs were spin coated on glass substrates at 4, 000  rpm for 60  s. Then, the glass substrates coated with CdTe QDs are placed in a vacuum environment (approximately 10 - 3  Torr) for approximately 1  h to evaporate the solvent.|$|E
30|$|The {{determination}} of the surface tension was performed at room temperature via the Wilhelmy plate method. All glassware and the platinum plate were rinsed with <b>sulfochromic</b> <b>acid</b> prior to the experiment to avoid interference of traces of residual compounds. A dilution series in distilled water ranging from 2.0  g/L to 0.01  mg/L was prepared and the surface tension was determined for each sample. The CMC values were determined as the concentration at which the minimal surface tension was reached when plotting the natural logarithm of the sophorolipid concentration against the surface tension. For sophorolipid lactone 5, the concentration of solubilized sophorolipid was determined with the TOC- 5000 (Shimadzu) since this compound is not well soluble in water. With the bruto formula (C 34 H 56 O 14), the actual sophorolipid concentration could be calculated.|$|E
40|$|Scanning {{tunneling}} microscopy (STM) {{has been}} used to study: (a) Self-assembled monolayers and sub-monolayers of butanethiol adsorbed onto highly uniform Au/mica films, (b) DNA adsorbates on different substrates prepared by different deposition techniques. In addition, surface preparation techniques have been investigated. Two strongly oxidizing solutions (sulfochromic and piranha acids) have been studied for the elimination of residual organic adsorbates on the Au/mica substrate. Treatment of the Au/mica surface with piranha acid leads to extensive and uncontrolled etching of the surface, and severe disruption of the surface topography. Limited exposure of the Au/mica surfaces to <b>sulfochromic</b> <b>acid</b> leads to the formation of permanent etch pits of the surface that are exclusively one Au layer deep; extended exposure leads to progressive lateral etching of the surface, ultimately leading to the formation of 3. 3 - 3. 6 A high islands on the otherwise flat surface. STM images taken of fully-equilibrated butanethiol monolayer films show molecularly resolved features that are believed to correspond to the methyl terminations of the organic surface. Large domains of organized adsorbates and a variant of the previously reported p× 3 superlattice structure is observed on these surfaces; using this nomenclature, the basic repeat unit of the structure reported herein corresponds to a 7 × 3 superlattice. The study of sub-monolayer films shows the island-like formations of SAMs on the gold surface; each island has same molecular structure as observed in monolayer films. Natural plasmids of different lengths together with chemically modified oligonucleotide sequences are adsorbed onto graphite and Au/mica surfaces and studied using the STM. High resolution images were obtained with clearly resolved helical structures...|$|E
