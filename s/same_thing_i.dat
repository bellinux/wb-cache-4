25|$|I regret nothing: 1970, the abductions, the prison, the suffering, nothing. I {{did what}} I had to do. Placed before the same {{circumstances}} today, I would do exactly the <b>same</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> will never deny what I did and what happened. It {{was not a}} youthful indiscretion.|$|E

Whereas, if he is telling me the <b>same</b> <b>thing...</b> <b>I</b> will not waste time asking him questions because I am also creatively aware why he needs them." ...|$|E
500|$|The Chariot is {{frequently}} called a Christian band, which Scogin agreed {{with in a}} 2005 interview: [...] "We are Christians in a band therefore we are a Christian band. We are not ashamed of our beliefs but we don’t force feed people what we believe either." [...] In 2006, he reaffirmed his previous statements and further opined, [...] "When I was growing up, if I liked , I listened to it — and I went to the shows. If I didn't, I didn't. It wasn't like, 'Oh, they don't believe the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> do,' [...] People care {{too much about the}} fashion of it all. To me, a band's either good or they ain't, and that's the only thing that should matter." ...|$|E

500|$|Fans ask me all {{the time}} {{what it is like to}} be a rock star. I can tell that they are dreaming, as I dreamed, when I was a kid, of someday ruling the world with a rock band. I tell them the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> would tell any young rock-star-to-be [...] you will get lonely. You will meet two hundred people every night, but each {{conversation}} will generally last approximately thirty seconds, and consist of you trying to convince them that no, you do not want their underwear. Then you will be alone again, in your motel room. Or you will be on your bus, in your little space, trying to kill the nine hours it takes to get to the next city, whichever city it is. This is the life of a rock star.|$|E
500|$|The New York Times wrote, [...] "In glorifying {{those who}} are first, the second is often forgotten... Larry Doby {{integrated}} all those American League ball parks where Jackie Robinson never appeared. And {{he did it with}} class and clout." [...] During the 1997 season, when the long-departed Jackie Robinson's number 42 was being retired throughout baseball, and the still-living Doby was being virtually ignored by the media, an editorial in Sports Illustrated pointed out that Doby had to suffer the same indignities that Robinson did, and with nowhere near the media attention and implicit support. Scoop Jackson in 2007 wrote, in response to the tradition of MLB players wearing jerseys in homage of Robinson, [...] "Second place finishers in America are suckers. And so are those who make the story of history less simple than it needs to be. This happens sometimes in America. Those who don't come first or don't do things a certain way get lost. They disappear." [...] "Jackie got all the publicity for putting up with it (racial slurs). But it was the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> had to deal with. He was first, but the crap I took was just as bad. Nobody said, 'We're gonna be nice to the second Black,'" [...] Doby said.|$|E

I'd go to them parties just to watch him play," [...] Kirby said. [...] "Then I'd {{go home and get}} my guitar and try to do the <b>same</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> was just playing a straight guitar and I had to raise the strings up, put a nut under the strings." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{will try}} {{not to say the}} <b>same</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> have set down in my other [...] letter of the 2nd, but I can't promise, as my poor head is still giddy [...] with my late fever.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] said Deronda, {{with some}} {{softening}} of voice. [...] "But experience differs for different people. We don't all wince at the <b>same</b> <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> have {{had plenty of}} proof {{that you are not}} dense." [...] He smiled at her.|$|R

2500|$|She {{went into}} the 2015 World Championships in Athletics as the {{favourite}} to win, having achieved higher scores than rival Jessica Ennis-Hill since Hill's return from pregnancy. Despite this, Hill won by 115pts with a season's best 6,669. Theisen-Eaton was disappointed with her silver medal saying [...] "I'm disappointed. I went in as the favourite and I didn't compete how I had to to win gold. And that was my own fault. So I am disappointed with it, {{but there are some}} lessons that I have learned from it that hopefully I can take into next year...I mean, I scored 250 points less than I already have this year, and had I just done the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> had done already previously this year, it would have got me a gold." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, on July 26, 2012, Vilma {{and seven}} {{witnesses}} from the Saints testified {{in front of}} a federal judge in New Orleans that NFL commissioner Roger Goodell got his facts wrong in the bounty scandal."Everybody was sworn in under oath {{in front of a}} judge with the risk of perjury and jail time if we were lying, and categorically denied there was a bounty," [...] Vilma said in a text message to ESPN's Ed Werder. [...] "Seven people testified, 2 sworn affidavits (one by Drew Brees) all saying the <b>same</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> ask that you and ESPN report the facts. No more bias or b.s. or hearsay. I gave you facts that you can report if so choose." [...] Tulane University Sports Law Program Director Gabe Feldman (who attended the hearing in court) said, [...] "Clearly the judge, by her questions, indicated she thinks Goodell overstepped his authority, and this case was always going to be about if he executed his power fairly... The NFL's retort is that with all due deference, you don't get to second guess (commissioner Roger Goodell). Judges only have limited jurisdiction over arbitration issues." ...|$|E
2500|$|Residente {{originally}} {{studied to}} be an accountant, and Visitante finished a computer science degree. An art course prompted Residente {{to pursue a career}} as a multimedia designer, and Visitante became a full-time musician and producer. [...] Residente states that his degree in design has influenced his musical style: [...] "What I used to do with my visual art is the <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> do now with my lyrics. [...] My songs are descriptive, very visual." [...] Besides this, Residente was a fan of what was then called [...] "underground rap" [...] in Puerto Rico, and started to earn a reputation as a lyricist (Residente says, with some embarrassment, that his moniker at the time was [...] "El Déspota", or [...] "The Despot"). Meanwhile, Visitante participated in Bayanga, a rock and Brazilian batucada group. [...] After Residente finished studying in Georgia at the Savannah College of Art and Design and earned a [...] master of fine arts in animation, illustration, sequential art and film, he returned to Puerto Rico. Soon after, both of them started working on their music. They claim they initially did it as a joke, but they still managed to get some of their songs heard throughout Puerto Rico. [...] They began recording music together in 2004, with the idea of hosting their work on a website, beginning with two demos ("La Tripleta" [...] and [...] "La Aguacatona"). [...] Within a year, the duo began looking for a record label to distribute their music commercially. [...] They decided to pursue a deal at White Lion Records, because Tego Calderón was on the label, whom the two admired.|$|E
