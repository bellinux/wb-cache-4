40|$|Stigma (prejudice or {{negative}} stereotypes associated with personal attributes such {{the presence of}} ill health or disease) is an important concept as {{it has the potential}} to adversely impact on social exclusion, help seeking behaviours and the utilisation of health and social services. Whilst limited international research suggests that there may be <b>stigma</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>dementia,</b> this paper presents results from the first comprehensive study to explore stigma towards dementia in Australia. Results from an online survey of Australian adults (45 - 60 years) outline the nature and presence of negative attitudes or stereotypes towards dementia and people living with dementia, and examine which information sources may have informed these perceptions. Implications are discussed in relation to the need for action or interventions that may be necessary to shift changes in public perceptions and attitudes in relation to dementia...|$|E
40|$|Through its {{attack on}} memory and other {{cognitive}} functions, Alzheimer's disease influences how people feel {{able to present}} themselves to others, {{and the way in}} which others respond. Studies asking people newly diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease about their concerns, suggest that many people fear others finding out and take steps to conceal. This has consequences of inhibiting the continuation of valued activities and limiting the social support available to the person with dementia. The present study explores how people with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease think about and experience decision-making with regard to disclosures to others, and how they experience others' responses. Seven people with early-stage Alzheimer's disease were interviewed about their experiences relating to disclosures of dementia-related information. Their accounts were analysed using an Interpretative Phenomenological Approach. The analysis suggested 3 major themes, of factors influencing disclosure, managing disclosure, and outcomes of disclosure decision. Participants displayed different disclosure strategies, of concealment, disclosure and a nondisclosure which was not motivated by concerns about others knowing. Those presenting with disclosure and non-disclosure strategies tended to hold normalising accounts of their memory difficulties, and to express more acceptance with their situation. Those that concealed presented with more distress and concern at their situation, and were more likely to invoke constructions of illness and decline. The findings are discussed in relation to the social context where there is a <b>stigma</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>dementia,</b> and in relation to the anxiety that fears of future decline may elicit. It is suggested that participants disclosures were managed in a way to limit the impact of the cognitive difficulties, stigma and anxieties on their sense of self, and their life and relationships...|$|E
40|$|Research {{exploring}} {{identity in}} the dementia context reveals that some aspects of personal and social identity persist in dementia while others evolve as persons living with dementia find ways {{to live with the}} changes in their lives. Leisure can be a space for developing and expressing identity and a space to resist stereotypical images and social expectations. Leisure may also {{play an important role in}} providing meaningful activity and engagement in life. Nonetheless, the meaning and experience of leisure in the context of dementia have received very little attention in the literature. Guided by the personhood movement, this phenomenological study aims to understand the subjective experience of dementia and the meaning and experience of leisure in the lives of persons living with early stage dementia. It explores leisure’s role in identity maintenance and/or development and leisure as a space for slowing down the process of dementia and resisting <b>stigma</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>dementia</b> and identity loss that could occur in dementia. Four persons living with early stage memory loss were recruited through local agencies to participate in this study. Each participant engaged in four conversational interviews following McCracken’s (1988) long interview format. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were also collected through participant observation. The participants and I engaged in at least one of their favourite leisure activities together. Detailed field notes were recorded following each participant observation session. Using the method of photovoice, participants were given disposable cameras and asked to take photos of objects, places, and subjects that were meaningful for their leisure. These photos were discussed in Interview 2. Data were analysed in a manner consistent with phenomenology. Findings revealed that the participants experienced their journeys of memory loss within a paradox of challenge and hope. Participants juxtaposed the negative aspects of living with memory loss with the positive aspects of their lives. Essences of the experience include struggling with change, in which participants experience a wide variety of challenges as a result of being diagnosed with memory loss, including muddled thinking, fluctuating abilities, draining energy, frightening awareness, and disquieting emotions. However, participants counter these changes with the variety of ways in which they tackle life with dementia, including reconciling life as it is, battling through the changes by being proactive, living through relationships, being optimistic, and prolonging engagement in meaningful activity. Participants also experience threatening assaults on identities. Identity is threatened in terms of disappearing roles, losing independence, struggling with demeaning images and expectations, and losing confidence. However, participants juxtapose these threatening assaults by upholding identities. They do this by emphasizing abilities through leisure, changing perspectives, and engaging in life through leisure. 	This study deepens our current understandings of the subjective experience of dementia and leisure’s role within that experience. It helps us to understand the experience of leisure within the context of memory loss in terms of four lifeworld existentials: lived time, lived space, lived body, and lived other. The findings also contribute to our understandings of how persons living with dementia use leisure to resist a master status of dementia. Participants in this study used leisure as a space for resisting both the stigma of memory loss and the progression of memory loss. They overcome challenges in their leisure to demonstrate to themselves and others that they have many remaining abilities and are able to maintain valued aspects of their identities. The findings suggest that service providers, family members, and persons living with dementia should carefully consider the meaning of leisure and find ways to facilitate involvement in leisure that is meaningful for persons living with memory loss. In terms of future research, leisure in the context of relationships, including the importance of advocacy work for persons with dementia, should be examined. Although this study provides insight into the possibilities of alternative methods for understanding the experience of memory loss, further exploration is needed in this area...|$|E

40|$|There {{are over}} 850, 000 people living <b>with</b> <b>Dementia</b> in the United Kingdom {{and the number}} is {{predicted}} to rise to one million by 2025 (Alzheimer’s Society, 2014). The Dementia Friends initiative was started to provide information sessions to raise awareness, reduce <b>stigma</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> living <b>with</b> <b>Dementia,</b> promote social inclusion and develop dementia friendly communities. Dementia Friends Champions (DFC’s) are volunteers who deliver information sessions {{about the impact of}} <b>dementia</b> <b>with</b> the aim of turning understanding into action (Alzheimer’s Society, 2015). Reflecting on the experiences of DFC’s provides an opportunity to hear experiences, concerns, questions, fears, beliefs, values and perspectives about what dementia means in the twenty first century. Aims: The research aims to bring an original contribution by exploring the lived experience of volunteer DFC’s to promote social action, develop the dementia friends provision and promote inclusion for individuals living <b>with</b> <b>dementia.</b> Methodology: A qualitative phenomenological research design is being undertaken. Sample: Eleven DFC’s were recruited from the London region using purposive sampling. Method: Semi structured interviews were undertaken. Analysis: Interpretative phenomenological analysis is being undertaken. Research poetry is being produced by the researcher including found poetry from the transcripts and generated poetry from the researcher’s insights from the research. Implications for practice: The qualitative research will be disseminated in academic publications, oral and poster presentations. The research poetry will be presented in different arenas, through publication, presentations, poetry reading, conferences and workshops. Empowering the person living <b>with</b> <b>dementia</b> requires an informed, caring, inclusive and dementia friendly community and society.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} a {{study that}} attempted {{to better understand the}} tendency to stigmatize help-seeking among Koreans. Specific research questions investigated were: Is there a relationship between individualism-collectivism and tolerance of <b>stigma</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> help-seeking among Koreans? Is there a difference in tolerance of <b>stigma</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> help-seeking after a counseling experience? and Is there a difference in tolerance of <b>stigma</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> help-seeking between a community sample (n= 192) and a college student sample (n= 151) in Korea? Results suggest that the higher the level of vertical individualism people exhibit, the less tolerant they are of the <b>stigma</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> seeking psychological help. Also results show a significant inverse relationship between vertical-individualism and tolerance of <b>stigma</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> help-seeking in the college student sample, but no significant relationship between individualism-collectivism and tolerance of <b>stigma</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> help-seeking in the community sample.

40|$|Oral Session 13 : Fighting Stigma - Talk 8 Aim: Stigma of {{psychosis}} has {{negative impact}} on help-seeking behaviour and delay appropriate treatment. <b>Stigma</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> treatment is a comparatively less researched topic in Chinese population, which may affect patients’ adherence and recovery. We designed a cross-sectional survey to investigate the public <b>stigma</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> treatment of psychosis in Hong Kong. Methods: Participants were recruited from public through electronic communication and social media. Public <b>stigma</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> treatment of psychosis was assessed online using a modified Attitude Toward Psychotropic Medications Questionnaire. Knowledge about psychosis was assessed by modified Knowledge About Schizophrenia Test. Results: (Preliminary) Nearly half of participants believed antipsychotics would make patients weak and enervated. Around one-third of participants believed antipsychotics had high risk of dependence. About one-fifth of participants believed antipsychotics were harmful poisonous substances. Its association with knowledge and demographic information will also be discussed. Conclusions: The study explored the public <b>stigma</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> treatment of psychosis in Chinese population. Effective measures to reduce public <b>stigma</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> treatment of psychosis in Chinese population are needed to be explored in the future...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Although {{there is}} {{substantial}} concern about negative attitudes to mental illness, {{little is known about}} the <b>stigma</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) or its measurement. The aim of this study was to develop a multi-item measure of Generalised Anxiety Disorder stigma (the GASS). Methods Stigma items were developed from a thematic analysis of web-based text about the <b>stigma</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> GAD. Six hundred and seventeen members of the public completed a survey comprising the resulting 20 stigma items and measures designed to evaluate construct validity. Follow-up data were collected for a subset of the participants (n = 212). Results The factor structure comprised two components: Personal Stigma (views about Generalised Anxiety Disorder); and Perceived Stigma (views about the beliefs of most others in the community). There was evidence of good construct validity and reliability for each of the Generalised Anxiety Stigma Scale (GASS) subscales. Conclusions The GASS is a promising brief measure of the <b>stigma</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> Generalised Anxiety Disorder. </p...|$|R

40|$|Australian {{research}} shows that stigma is a major barrier to treatment seeking (Rockloff, 2004) and may impede the accurate measurement of problem gambling prevalence. To date, no validated tool is available to assess the <b>stigma</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> gambling. This project investigated both internally experienced and externalised (perceived) <b>stigma</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> gambling, as measured with two new survey instruments were developed for this purpose. We reviewed existing measures of <b>stigma</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> other non-gambling behaviours (e. g., alcohol, drug abuse,smoking, eating disorders) to construct items that were conceptually related to gambling behaviour. The scales were then validated by using a large representative community sample (N= 1366). Internal reliability analysis, factor analysis, and multivariate analysis were used to analyse the results and to explore the measurement of perceived and self-stigma in a community sample, taking into account respondents’ gambling experience and relevant socio-demographic information. Results supported a model of perceived stigma along two dimensions (Contempt and Ostracism) and a unidimensional model of experienced stigma. The scales were shown to have strong psychometric properties and to differentiate well between <b>stigmas</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> recreational and problem gambling behaviours. A scale that measures stigma related to gambling behaviour will provide researchers, policymakers, industry bodies, and clinicians with a tool that contributes to a growing understanding of the gambling experiences of individuals and the impacts of gambling on communities...|$|R
