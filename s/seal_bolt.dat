40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new seal for dry storage containers with nuclear material. Currently, sealing of dry storage casks containing spent fuel presents various challenges to safeguards inspectors. Continuity of knowledge {{needs to be}} reliably maintained over periods of time that can be decades. Seal replacements and verification, require significant Inspector efforts, radiological dose, and is continuing to grow. A decrease in Inspector effort is required and fail-safe redundancy is sought. These needs called {{for the development of}} a new compact <b>sealing</b> <b>bolt</b> covering these requirements. The Ultrasonic Optical <b>Sealing</b> <b>Bolt</b> (UOSB) is based on the JRC Candu Sealing System (JCSS), which is approved for safeguards use by IAEA and EURATOM safeguards. The new seal includes the same integrity element with the same identity element In addition, the UOSB integrates the additional element of a Fibre Optical Cable (FOC). This construction is in principal two seals-in-one allowing versatility. After several design iterations, field trials and a positive Vulnerability Assessment, the UOSB design was finalized. The first UOSBs, combined with EOSS and Cobra seals, were installed on dry storage containers at the Ignalina nuclear power plant (Lithuania) in June 2014.

40|$|Hydroforming, which {{utilizes}} {{hydraulic pressure}} to manufacture metallic components, is a near net shape forming process that could offer many potential advantages {{in terms of}} cost, mechanical properties, weight reduction and manufacturing time over traditional production methods. Through the use of two case studies with components similar to ones used in gas turbine engines, this paper presents {{different ways in which}} hydroforming technology could be exploited to reduce both the part count and operations required to manufacture certain aerospace structures by using methods which have already shown to be effective in other industries. It is shown that cost, manufacturing operations and manufacturing complexity can be reduced while maintaining the function of a component by switching the manufacturing process from a conventional method to one that includes hydroforming. These parts illustrate a method for assessing hydroforming manufacturability from reported theory and heuristics in the available literature. The results provide an example which engineers can use as a case study for how to start assessing how easily a given component can be adapted to the hydroforming process and how the benefits can be assessed. The reason for these results is that hydroforming offers a greater level of material formability compared to other forming processes and as individual components become geometrically more complicated the overall part count can be reduced as it takes fewer components to make an assembly, which in turn reduces weight as fewer nuts, <b>bolts,</b> <b>seals</b> and welding flanges are needed. The automotive industry has already demonstrated that this approach can deliver tangible benefits and hydroformed components are already used in larger airframe structures, but the hope is that the same approach can facilitate similar weight and cost savings in gas turbine engine components...|$|R
40|$|Lecturepg. 1 It {{should be}} an {{objective}} to predict bearing housing vibrations by means of finite element methods and avoid them in the design phase rather than to go in for corrective actions on the test bed or in the field. Bearing housing vibrations due to an excitation by the impeller vanes occur, {{if there is a}} natural frequency of the pump. The finite element method is a useful tool to determine natural frequencies but it is still necessary to compare them with real tested structures. Especially the connecting stiffness between different parts in a structure and the boundary conditions has often to be estimated. Within this paper the determination of bearing housing frequencies has been undertaken systematically from a simple test device to a complete barrel pump. With the test device several influences onto the natural frequencies were studied, such as internal pressure, <b>bolting,</b> <b>seals,</b> and foundation stiffness. It is demonstrated that with appropriate modeling and assumptions the measured frequencies can be accurately met by means of finite elements. The rules observed were applied to full 3 -D model of a barrel pump. The natural frequencies were determined by means of this finite element model. An experimental modal analysis was carried out on the real structure of this pump assembly. At several locations of the surface transducers were placed and the response due to the hammer test was identified in terms of frequencies and modal shapes. This result was correlated with the finite element results to update the finite element model and obtain better congruence between experiment and analysis. The results were promising, especially for the most important bearing housing natural frequency, where the differences between analysis and test were very low. This gives confidence to future analyses of bearing housing vibrations...|$|R
40|$|There is {{currently}} a need for large diameter flanges for the supply of water in South Africa. These large diameter pipe flanges are required to accommodate pipes with nominal bores of up to 4 m and should successfully withstand internal pressures of up to 8 MPa. No current relevant standard / code contains prescribed design values for flanges which either operate at such high pressures or have such large diameters. Due to this an alternative method of design, by means of non-linear finite element modelling, is proposed. Three types of integral flange designs are considered, namely: flat face, raised face, and a modified raised face with an O-ring groove. The effects of creep-relaxation, flange rotation, and the bolting sequence are considered. For each of these designs a finite element model was created and compared to a small scale experiment which included strain and contact pressure measurements. The proposed non-linear finite element models were capable of accurately predicting the strains in the flanges {{as well as the}} contact pressures between the faces of the flange and the surfaces of the packing material. Finally, a comparison between the ASME design method and the proposed non-linear finite element modelling design method was done for the large diameter flanges. It was found that the ASME design code did not have the ability to accurately predict the stresses in the flanges. It was also found that by using the maximum equivalent Von Mises stress as failure criteria for the flanges and fasteners, and contact pressure for the <b>sealing</b> ability, circular <b>bolted</b> flange connections which are lighter, safer, and leak tight could be designed by means of the proposed non-linear finite element models.

40|$|The Subsea blowout {{preventer}} (BOP) which is latched to a subsea wellhead {{is one of}} several barriers in the well to prevent kicks and blowouts and it is the most important and critical equipment, as it becomes the last line of protection against blowout. The BOP system used in Subsea drilling operations is considered a Safety – Critical System, with a high severity consequence following its failure. Following past offshore blowout incidents such as the most recent Macondo in the Gulf of Mexico, there have been investigations, research, and improvements sought for improved understanding of the BOP system and its operation. This informs the need for a systematic re-evaluation of the Subsea BOP system to understand its associated risk and reliability and identify critical areas/aspects/components. Different risk analysis techniques were surveyed and the Failure modes effect and criticality analysis (FMECA) selected to be used to drive the study in this thesis. This is due to it being a simple proven cost effective process that can add value {{to the understanding of the}} behaviours and properties of a system, component, software, function or other. The output of the FMECA can be used to inform or support other key engineering tasks such as redesigning, enhanced qualification and testing activity or maintenance for greater inherent reliability and reduced risk potential. This thesis underscores the application of the FMECA technique to critique associated risk of the Subsea BOP system. System Functional diagrams was developed with boundaries defined, a FMECA were carried out and an initial select list of critical component failure modes identified. The limitations surrounding the confidence of the FMECA failure modes ranking outcome based on Risk priority number (RPN) is presented and potential variations in risk interpretation are discussed. The main contribution in this thesis is an innovative framework utilising Multicriteria decision making (MCDA) analysis techniques with consideration of fuzzy interval data is applied to the Subsea BOP system critical failure modes from the FMECA analysis. It utilised nine criticality assessment criteria deduced from expert consultation to obtain a more reliable ranking of failure modes. The MCDA techniques applied includes the technique for order of Preference for similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), Fuzzy TOPSIS, TOPSIS with interval data, and Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment of Evaluations (PROMETHEE). The outcome of the Multi-criteria analysis of the BOP system clearly shows failures of the Wellhead connector, LMRP hydraulic connector and Control system related failure as the Top 3 most critical failure with respect to a well control. The critical failure mode and components outcome from the analysis in this thesis is validated using failure data from industry database and a sensitivity analysis carried out. The importance of maintenance, testing and redundancy to the BOP system criticality was established by the sensitivity analysis. The potential for MCDA to be used for more specific analysis of criteria for a technology was demonstrated. Improper maintenance, inspection, testing (functional and pressure) are critical to the BOP system performance and sustenance of a high reliability level. Material selection and performance of components (<b>seals,</b> flanges, packers, <b>bolts,</b> mechanical body housings) relative to use environment and operational conditions is fundamental to avoiding failure mechanisms occurrence.
