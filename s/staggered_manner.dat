What he means by “tempo” and “Scherzo character” is the accelerando into the 3/4 Allegro moderato section. Finally, he shows how “tonic colour” returns in measure 158 (rehearsal letter B), putting into place all elements of the recapitulation.

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} continuum {{model is}} developed for stress relaxation in thin films through grain boundary (GB) diffusion. When {{a thin film}} with columnar grains is subjected to thermal stress, stress gradients along the GBs are relaxed by diffusion of material from the film surface into the GBs. The transported material constitutes a wedge and becomes the source of stress inside the adjacent elastic grains that are perfectly bonded to the substrate. In the model, the coupling between diffusion and elasticity is obtained by numerically solving the governing equations in a <b>staggered</b> <b>manner.</b> A finite difference scheme is used to solve the diffusion equations, modified in order to implement realistic boundary conditions, while the elasticity problem is solved with the finite element method.

For slender grains, the GB wedge attains a more uniform shape and relaxation is more effective.

40|$|Longitudinal steel {{lap splice}} is always {{required}} in reinforced concrete (RC) columns. Normally, in countries having high seismic risk, lap splices of longitudinal steel must be located around mid-height of the storey. However, in regions of low-medium seismic risk, including Hong Kong, lap splices of longitudinal steel begin right above the beam-column interface to facilitate ease of construction. Such splicing method would undesirably cause the column critical region {{to move away}} from the beam-column interface under inelastic deformation. In this paper, the effects of different lap splice locations of longitudinal steel on flexural strength and ductility of RC columns with concrete cube strength around 100 MPa are studied. Four RC column specimens, which contained no lap splice, all lap splices within and outside critical region, as well as lap splices in <b>staggered</b> <b>manner,</b> were tested under simultaneous compressive axial load and reversed cyclic inelastic displacement. It is evident from the results that the column containing lap splices within its critical region had the largest strength but the poorest ductility performance. On the contrary, the column containing lap splices outside its critical region had strength and ductility comparable to those of the column without lap splice. Based on these observations, a recommendation is proposed for positioning longitudinal steel lap splices in RC columns. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

In these cases, laparoscopic appendicectomy runs a risk {{of contamination}} of the peritoneal cavity with worms. We reviewed our practice to suggest changes that will reduce the release of worms and propose methods to use in case contamination occurs. Methods 498 patients underwent appendicectomy over a sixty-three month period. 13 (2. 6 %) patients had confirmed E. vermicularis on histology of whom 6 (46 %) were performed laparoscopically. These patients' case notes were retrospectively reviewed. ResultsThe worms were noted intra-operatively during the laparoscopic appendicectomies. In 2 cases, where peritoneal cavity contamination with worms occurred, they were dealt with careful diathermy or endoscopic suction. In the other cases, contamination was avoided by simple measures including division of the appendix in a <b>staggered</b> <b>manner</b> whilst maintaining traction, removal of worms using endoscopic suction or diathermy and quick transfer to a specimen bag. ConclusionWe highlight that the symptoms of appendicitis can be due to Enterobius vermicularis infestation without any histological evidence of acute inflammation. Surgeons {{need to be aware}} of this possibility during laparoscopic appendicectomy and simple techniques can minimise the risk of contamination. It also enables early diagnosis and treatment without awaiting histological findings...|$|E
40|$|Analysis {{of surface}} water flows is of central {{importance}} in understanding and predicting {{a wide range}} of water engineering issues. Dynamics of surface water is reasonably well described using the shallow water equations (SWEs) with the hydrostatic pressure assumption. The SWEs are nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations that are in general required to be solved numerically. Application of a simple and efficient numerical model is desirable for solving the SWEs in practical problems. This study develops a new numerical model of the depth-averaged horizontally 2 D SWEs referred to as 2 D finite element/volume method (2 D FEVM) model. The continuity equation is solved with the conforming, standard Galerkin FEM scheme and momentum equations with an upwind, cell-centered finite volume method scheme, utilizing the water surface elevation and the line discharges as unknowns aligned in a <b>staggered</b> <b>manner.</b> The 2 D FEVM model relies on neither Riemann solvers nor high-resolution algorithms in order to serve as a simple numerical model.
