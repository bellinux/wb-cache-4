5|$|Agnosticism is criticized from {{a variety}} of standpoints. <b>Some</b> <b>religious</b> thinkers see agnosticism as {{limiting}} the mind's capacity to know reality to materialism. Some atheists criticize {{the use of the term}} agnosticism as functionally indistinguishable from atheism; this results in frequent criticisms of those who adopt the term as avoiding the atheist label.|$|E

5|$|Maeser {{believed}} that religion {{played a key}} role in true education. He viewed each student as a child of God that had an individual capacity and potential. He thought that all schools should adhere to <b>some</b> <b>religious</b> aspect. He also argued that public high schools should be supplemented by religion classes. Maeser, however, was respectful of other religious denominations although Brigham Young Academy and Brigham Young University integrated beliefs from the LDS Church.|$|E

5|$|Catholicism {{was first}} {{propagated}} in Nepal during the 18th century, though from 1810 to 1950 no missionaries were allowed in Nepal. Since 1951, missionaries have again been allowed, though proselytism has remained illegal, and conversion to Christianity remained illegal until 1990. In 1983 a mission sui iuris covering Nepal was created, and in 1996 it {{was raised to}} an Apostolic Prefecture. The 1990 Nepali constitution did not guarantee religious freedom for Christians, but as of May 2006 Nepal has been declared a secular state. The interim constitution, finalized in 2007, guarantees <b>some</b> <b>religious</b> freedom but prohibits people from trying to convert others. On February 10, 2007, Benedict XVI elevated the prefecture of Nepal {{to the rank of}} a vicariate and appointed Anthony Francis Sharma as the first vicar and first Nepalese bishop of the Catholic Church.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries, a {{significant}} number of lynchings occurred in the Southern United States, primarily of African Americans in the states of Georgia, Mississippi, and Texas. Between 1890 and 1920, about 3,000 African Americans were killed by lynch mobs, usually after whites were the victims of crimes purportedly committed by blacks. Supporters of lynching justified the practice as a way to assert dominance over African Americans, to whom they attributed a criminal nature. Lynching also provided a sense of white solidarity in a culture with changing demographics and power structures. Although lynching was tolerated by much of southern society, opponents of the practice emerged, including <b>some</b> <b>religious</b> leaders and the nascent National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).|$|E
5|$|The Church {{likewise}} {{identified the}} origin and ownership of documents and buildings with seals, which were typically a pointed oval called a vesica to distinguish from round seals in non-religious use. Edward I of England decreed in 1307 that all legal documents required a seal. These seals initially depicted a person, but as secular seals began to depict only a shield, clergy likewise used seals with heraldic insignia. Personal seals of bishops and abbots continued to be used after their deaths, gradually becoming an impersonal seal. Clergy tended to replace military devices with clerical devices. The shield was retained, but ecclesiastical hats often replaced helmets and coronets. In <b>some</b> <b>religious</b> arms a skull replaces the helmet.|$|E

Although Rowling found it difficult to finish the book, it won high praise and awards from critics, young readers and the book industry, although some critics thought the story was perhaps too frightening for younger children. Much like with other novels in the series, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets triggered religious debates; <b>some</b> <b>religious</b> authorities have condemned its use of magical themes, while others have praised its emphasis on self-sacrifice and on the way in which a person's character {{is the result of the}} person's choices.|$|E
