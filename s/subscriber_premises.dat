40|$|This paper reviews {{broadband}} architectures and ISP service profiles to {{show that}} open access is technically feasible and economically viable, even if implementation is not always trivial. The decisive factor is planning. If broadband networks are built with interconnection in mind, {{it will be easier}} to implement open access. Hence, I argue, the FCC should encourage the deployment of open-access-ready networks. Incentives that the FCC can offer at this stage to cable operators to design open access into their networks will have two benefits [...] -they will lower the costs of implementing open access regulations should the FCC decide to act in the future. More significantly, if broadband network operators are encouraged to build open-access-ready networks, they will be better positioned to offer open access on their own, thereby eliminating the need for regulation. Broadband Access Architectures The problem of open access for broadband access networks depends in large part on where a subscriber's traffic first contends with other subscribers' traffic for network resources. There are three locations where contention can first occur: 1. at a carrier aggregation point remote from the subscriber's location (a telephone company central office or a cable company head-end,) 2. on the transmission medium, immediately upon leaving the <b>subscriber's</b> <b>premises,</b> or 3. at some point between the subscriber's location and the carrier's point of presence. The point of first contention is critical to open access because contention means that the network operator must allocate network resources. Which users get what network resources, and when? The open access controversy revolves around this question: whose service provider is making the allocation of resources? Are both users the customers of [...] ...|$|R
50|$|From the Optical Network Terminal (ONT) at the <b>subscriber</b> <b>premises,</b> the RF {{video is}} {{typically}} delivered with a coaxial {{connection to a}} FiOS set-top box that handles both RF and IPTV video.

At the <b>subscriber</b> <b>premises,</b> an optical network terminal (ONT) converts signals to the corresponding in-home copper wiring for telephone, television, and Internet access.

50|$|The first {{application}} for balanced lines was for telephone lines. Interference that was of little consequence on a telegraph system (which is in essence digital) {{could be very}} disturbing for a telephone user. The initial format was to take two single-wire unbalanced telegraph lines and use them as a pair. This proved insufficient, however, {{with the growth of}} electric power transmission which tended to use the same routes. A telephone line running alongside a power line for many miles will inevitably have more interference induced in one leg than the other since one of them will be nearer to the power line. This issue was addressed by swapping the positions of the two legs every few hundred yards with a cross-over, thus ensuring that both legs had equal interference induced and allowing common-mode rejection to do its work. As the telephone system grew, it became preferable to use cable rather than open wires to save space, and also to avoid poor performance during bad weather. The cable construction used for balanced telephone cables was twisted pair; however, this did not become widespread until repeater amplifiers became available. For an unamplified telephone line, a twisted pair cable could only manage a maximum distance of 30 km. Open wires, on the other hand, with their lower capacitance, had been used for enormous distances—the longest was the 1500 km from New York to Chicago built in 1893. Loading coils were used to improve the distance achievable with cable but the problem was not finally overcome until amplifiers started to be installed in 1912. Twisted pair balanced lines are still widely used for local loops, the lines that connect each <b>subscriber's</b> <b>premises</b> to their respective exchange.|$|R

To accomplish the research objectives, a novel service and bandwidth focused DBA protocol is developed for standard time division multiplexing (TDM), gigabit-capable PONs (GPONs) by flexibly assigning a guaranteed minimum bandwidth to each optical network unit (ONU),terminated at <b>subscribers</b> <b>premises.</b> Modelling and simulation of the developed algorithms have displayed a tenfold enhancement in network performance, showing a superior performance to other published DBA protocols, in terms of mean packet delay. To accomplish protocol optimisation, the ONU upstream transmission properties of TDM-PONs have been further analysed and subsequently the ONU data transfer order in each communication cycle has been dynamically configured to increase the network upstream throughput by overlapping the upstream transmission period with parts of the bandwidth request-allocation process between OLT and ONUs. In addition, with the objective of extending the application of the developed protocol to long-reach PONs by means of reducing the augmented propagation delays due to the network???s extensive reach, the concept of virtual communication cycles has been incorporated into the optimised DBA algorithm. This approach demonstrates comparable transmission efficiency in the context of subscriber throughput and packet delay as in a standard PON but at much longer distances from the network exchange. To overcome the inevitably limited communication capacity of single wavelength TDM protocols and with the transportation of the ever increasing, time-sensitive, multi-media services in mind, a novel multi-wavelength DBA protocol is then developed to be applied to a wavelength division multiplexing???PON. With this protocol, both the downstream and upstream network capacity is dynamically adjusted according to subscribers??? service level and bandwidth demand in each polling cycle as opposed to a fixed upstream network capacity in TDM-PONs. It therefore also demonstrates improved upstream transmission efficiency...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a high density {{wavelength division multiplexing}} (WDM) optical access network for broadband access networks. In the network, a wavelength is pre-assigned to each subscriber. Arrayed waveguide gratings (AWGs) are used at a central office and a remote node for wavelength multi/demultiplexers. We introduce a method to tune the wavelengths of transmitters in both the central office and the <b>subscriber</b> <b>premises</b> {{to the center of}} each assigned transmission spectrum of an access network. Using this method, we confirm experimentally the controllability of the wavelengths on four laser diodes in the access network which was composed of two subscribers. The 1 × 40 AWGs with 0. 8 nm spacing were used. The experimental results indicate the controllability of the wavelengths of transmitters within the deviation of ± 0. 25 nm {{from the center of the}} transmission spectrum of two AWGs. The wavelengths are controlled during the environmental temperature of the AWG in the remote node varies within the range of ± 20 ℃. The temperature range of ± 20 ℃ is not enough for practical use. So as to minimize the temperature change of AWG, we propose a WDM access network which utilizes an athermal AWG in the remote node. The perfect temperature compensation of the athermal AWG is not necessarily required because the wavelength control system already exists. This results in the cost reduction of the athermal AWG. We study the wavelength control using cost-effective one-board-computer instead of the measurement server...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: The {{process of}} network {{planning}} {{is divided into}} two sub steps. The&# 13; first step is determining the location of the Multi Service Access Node (MSAN). The second step is the&# 13; construction of subscriber network lines from MSAN to subscribers to satisfy optimization criteria and&# 13; design constraints. Due to the complexity of this process artificial intelligence and clustering&# 13; techniques have been successfully deployed to solve many problems. The problems of the locations of&# 13; MSAN, the cabling layout and the computation of optimum cable network layouts have been&# 13; addressed in this study. The proposed algorithm, Clustering density-Based Spatial of Applications&# 13; with Noise original, minimal Spanning tree and modified Ant-Colony-Based algorithm (CBSCAN-SPANT),&# 13; used two clustering algorithms which are density-based and agglomerative clustering algorithm&# 13; using distances which are shortest paths distance and satisfying the network constraints. This algorithm&# 13; used wire and wireless technology to serve the subscribers demand and place the switches in a real&# 13; optimal place. Approach: The density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise original&# 13; (DBSCAN) algorithm has been modified and a new algorithm (NetPlan algorithm) has been proposed&# 13; by the author in a recent work to solve {{the first step in the}} problem of network planning. In the present&# 13; study, the NetPlan algorithm is modified by introduce the modified Ant-Colony-Based algorithm to&# 13; find the optimal path between any node and the corresponding MSAN node in the first step of network&# 13; planning process to determine nodes belonging to each cluster. The second step, in the process of&# 13; network planning, is also introduced in the present study.
