Results {{showed that a}} considerable variation existed among cultures in their growth viability {{in the presence of}} bile salt, deconjugation of bifidobacteria (infants DSM 2088 and angulatum DSM 20098) were shown to be the most bile <b>salts</b> <b>tolerant</b> culture. All bacterial strains tested in this study exhibited sensitivity to acidity at pH 2. However, increasing the pH of the medium to 3 had improved the acid tolerance of all strains except Streptococcus thermophilus. Addition of 1 % skim milk powder into medium at pH 2 increased the viability of all strains especially bifidobacteria strains. All tested strains removed less cholesterol from the broth (ranged from 3. 08 - 29. 68 %) compared to those grown in both supplemented with 0. 2 % bile salts (from 36. 07 - 55. 43 %). Furthermore, considerable amount of cholesterol was precipitated with cells obtained from broth enriched with 0. 2 % bile salts. Lactobacillus acidophilus DSM 20079 appeared to be more active in deconjugation of sodium taurocholate (2. 38 µmol/ml) compared to the other strains, as well as being able to remove up to 66. 61 mg of cholesterol (95. 6 %) from the culture medium and therefore, is regarded as a suitable candidate probiotic and adjunct culture...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{is based on}} synonymous codon usage and its relation with the salt resistant genes. The codon usage directly affects the level or even direction of changes in protein expression in responses to environmental stimuli. Soil salinity is a major abiotic stress for plant agriculture. Sodium ions in saline soils are toxic to plants because of their adverse effects on K+ nutrition, cytosolic enzyme activities, photosynthesis, and metabolism. In the recent study codon usage biase (CUB) has been studied in Arabidopsis thaliana salt resistant and housekeeping genes and their homologs in rice (Oryza sativa) to understand the salt stress and housekeeping genes relation with CUB. Total five <b>salt</b> stress <b>tolerant</b> genes; <b>Salt</b> Overly sensitive (SOS 1), basic lucien-Zipper Protein (bZIP), Calcinurin B like binding 10 (CBL 10), Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase- 3 (MPK 3) and Histidine Kinase- 1 (HK 1) were identified in Arabidopsis thaliana. For the comparative study and removing the organism bias the orthologues of the five <b>salt</b> stress <b>tolerant</b> genes were also identified in rice. Briefly, five salinity resistant and three housekeeping genes in Arabidopsis thaliana and their orthologues in rice, were subjected to CUB analysis. The four salt resistant genes (SOS 1, CBL 10, bZIP and HK 1) showed more than 50 % (71 %, 57 %, 67 % and 57 % respectively) similar codon usage bias for Arabidopsis thaliana and rice. On the other hand fifth salt resistant gene (MPK 3) showed less than 50 % (29 %) similar codon usage bias for Arabidopsis thaliana and rice. The three housekeeping genes (Actin, Tubulin and Ubiquitin) showed 76 % similar codon usage bias for Arabidopsis thaliana and rice. this will help us to engineer the salt resistant crops by adjusting the codon usage...|$|R

Transcripts of hydrogen peroxide scavenging enzymes such as phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPX), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and catalase 1 (CAT 1) in addition to some genes of cellular metabolism {{were found to be}} especially up-regulated at high salinity in the tolerant line. To analyse this process at the protein level we examined protein expression patterns under various stress conditions. A 25 kD protein with a pl of 4. 8 was found to be induced prominently under high salt concentrations (250 mmol/L), This salt-induced 25 kD protein has been purified and identified by peptide sequencing as PHGPX protein. The increase of the PHGPX protein level under salt stress in the tolerant line parallels the PHGPX mRNA results of array analysis but was more pronounced. We cloned and characterized the foxtail millet PHGPX cDNA, which shows 85 % and 95 % homology at the DNA and protein level, respectively, to one stress-induced member of the small barley PHGPX gene family encoding non-selenium glutathione peroxidases. As shown by Southern blot analysis, a small family of PHGPX genes exists in foxtail millet, too. The specific expression pattern of the PHGPX gene in salt-induced tolerant millet seedlings suggests that its product {{plays an important role in}} the defense reaction against salt-induced oxidative damage and that the characterized glutathione peroxidase is one of the components conferring resistance against <b>salt</b> to the <b>tolerant</b> foxtail millet cultivar...|$|R

In this study, 14 mandarin accessions representative of the diversity in this group were analyzed for their salt stress tolerance properties. Physiological parameters such as gas exchange, osmotic pressure, as well as leaf and root chloride contents were measured. Samples were harvested to characterize the presence of hydrogen peroxide and to monitor the activity of enzymes involved in reactive oxygen species synthesis and detoxification processes. Very different physiological behaviors were noted among accessions. Most cultivars that are used as rootstocks such as Citrus reshni Hort. ex Tan.

Also, some accessions used as varieties showed similar tolerance traits. Interestingly some accessions that presented high leaf chloride contents were not always associated with sensitivity traits. Also accessions such as 'Willowleaf' showed quite high leaf chloride contents that were correlated with better detoxification processes. Tolerance traits that we identified are discussed in relation to the known genetic structure in mandarins. Finally, some of the <b>salt</b> stress <b>tolerant</b> accessions that we identified could potentially be used as parents in rootstock breeding programs and others in scion variety breeding programs.
