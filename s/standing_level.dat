50|$|With the tie <b>standing</b> <b>level</b> {{after the}} first day, Belgian captain Van Herck gambled by {{selecting}} Goffin for the doubles (alongside Darcis) instead of Bemelmans. This {{was an attempt to}} win the tie by winning the doubles and the two singles matches not contested by Andy Murray. Van Herck also justified his decision by saying he felt they would have a better chance to win by playing {{from the back of the}} court, instead of playing a more typical doubles match at the net. The tactic appeared to work, as the Belgian pair won the second set to level the match and then took an early lead in the third. Darcis weakened later in the match and his serve was broken later in the third set, won 6 - 3 by the Murrays. After Jamie survived seven break points on his serve midway through the fourth set, the Darcis serve was broken again. Andy then closed out the victory, giving Great Britain a 2 - 1 lead.|$|E

Such studies therefore provide the best opportunities for assess-ing the demographic determinants of Ne and the relation-ship between Ne and population census number (N).

Distinguishing the relative impacts of demography from selection requires a baseline of expressed gene variation in naturally occurring populations. Six nuclear genes were sequenced {{to estimate the}} patterns and levels of genetic diversity in natural Arabidopsis lyrata subsp. petraea populations that differ in demographic histories since the Pleistocene. As expected, northern European populations have genetic signatures of a strong population bottleneck likely due to glaciation during the Pleistocene. Levels of diversity in the northern populations are about half of that in central European populations. Bayesian estimates of historical population size changes indicate that central European populations also have signatures of population size change since the last glacial maxima, suggesting that these populations are not as stable as previously thought. Time since divergence amongst northern European populations is higher than amongst central European populations, suggesting that the northern European populations were established before the Pleistocene and survived glaciation in small separated refugia. Estimates of demography based on expressed genes are complementary to estimates based on microsatellites and transposable elements, elucidating temporal shifts in population dynamics and confirming the importance of marke...|$|E
40|$|The tree Pometia pinnata Forst. forma glabra (Bl.) Jacobs is an ant-plant that {{provides}} lodging (leaf domatia) and food (extrafloral nectar, excretions of coccids) for ants. The leaf domatia are formed by {{two pairs of}} strongly modified basal leaflets. In total, 63 ant species from 18 genera and 4 subfamilies were encountered in the domatia of the host {{in the study area}} (Ulu Gombak, Malaysia). We found that the ant/ Pometia relationship has two stages: (i) an early 'myrmecophilic' phase of juvenile, domatia-free plants, and (ii) a 'myrmecophytic' phase of older plants in which ants nest in domatia. In the myrmecophilic stage, our short-term experiment revealed a significant greater loss of young leaflets when ants were excluded than on control plants to which ants had access; however, the area of remaining leaf was not different between treatment and control. Similar ambiguous effects were observed in the myrmecophytic stage: a snapshot census revealed {{no significant difference in the}} <b>standing</b> <b>level</b> of leaf herbivore damage between branches with and without nesting ants. However, our survey indicated that ant species differed in the protection provided to their host.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Foot orthoses {{are widely}} used in the {{management}} of flexible pes planus, yet the evidence to support this intervention has not been clearly defined. This systematic review aimed to critically appraise the evidence for the use of foot orthoses for flexible pes planus in adults. METHODS: Electronic databases (Medline, CINAHL, Cochrane, Web of science, SportDiscus, Embase) were systematically searched in June 2013 for randomised controlled, controlled clinical and repeated measure trials where participants had identified flexible pes planus using a validated and reliable measure of pes planus and the intervention was a rigid or semi-rigid orthoses with the comparison being a no-orthoses (shoes alone or flat non-posted insert) condition. Outcomes of interest were foot pain, rearfoot kinematics, foot kinetics and physical function. RESULTS: Of the 2, 211 articles identified by the searches, 13 studies met the inclusion criteria; two were randomised controlled trials, one was a controlled trial and 10 were repeated measure studies. Across the included studies, 59 relevant outcome measures were reported with 17 calculated as statistically significant large or medium effects observed with use of foot orthoses compared to the no orthoses condition (SMD range 1. 13 to - 4. 11). CONCLUSIONS: No high level evidence supported the use of foot orthoses for flexible pes planus. There is good to moderate level evidence that foot orthoses improve physical function (medial-lateral sway in <b>standing</b> (<b>level</b> II) and energy cost during walking (level III)). There is low level evidence (level IV) that foot orthoses improve pain, reduce rearfoot eversion, alter loading and impact forces; and reduce rearfoot inversion and eversion moments in flexible pes planus. Well-designed randomised controlled trials that include appropriate sample sizes, clinical cohorts and involve a measure of symptom change are required to determine the efficacy of foot orthoses to manage adult flexible pes planus.

40|$|One {{important}} goal of population genetics {{is to understand}} {{the relative importance of}} different evolutionary processes for shaping variation in natural populations. Here, I use multilocus data to show that natural selection on both synonymous and nonsynonymousmutations {{plays an important role in}} shaping levels of synonymous polymorphism in European aspen (Popu-lus tremula). Previous studies have documented a preferential fixation of synonymous mutations encoding preferred codons in P. tremula. The results presented here show that this has resulted in an increase in codon bias in P. tremula, consistent with stronger selection acting on synonymous codon usage. In addition, positive selection on nonsynonymous mutations appears to be common in P. tremula, with approximately 30 % of all mutations having been fixed by positive selection. In addition, the recurrent fixation of beneficial mutations also reduces <b>standing</b> <b>levels</b> of polymorphism as evidenced by a significantly negative relationship between the rate of protein evolution synonymous site diversity and silent site diversity. Finally, I use approximate Bayesian methods to estimate the strength of selection acting on beneficial substitutions. These calculations show that recurrent hitchhiking reduces polymorphism by, on average, 30 %. The product of strength of selection acting on beneficial mutations and the rate by which these occur across the genome (2 Neλs) equals 1. 54 × 10 − 7, which is in line with estimates from Drosophila where recurrent hitchhiking has also been shown to have significant effects on <b>standing</b> <b>levels</b> of polymorphism.

40|$|Fibre {{reinforced}} polymer (FRP) bridge decks {{have emerged}} as a competitive alternative to traditional decking solutions for the refurbishment of existing bridges, {{as well as the}} construction of new ones, in the past two decades. FRP decks offer inherent properties such as light weight, high strength and high resistance to aggressive environments. In addition, the prefabrication of FRP decks brings the benefits of industrial bridge construction and rapid on-site assembly leading to the minimisation of traffic disturbance. Even though the use of FRP decks started in the early 1990 s, the uptake of these decks has been slow in bridge construction and there remains a need for research in diverse technical areas to promote the widespread use of these decks. The existing research and field applications of FRP decks were synthesised to recognize the <b>standing</b> <b>level</b> of knowledge and map out possible knowledge gaps. As an outcome several research needs were identified wherein two of them were: to determine the potential of bridges with FRP decks with respect to sustainability, and to develop connections which enable rapid on-site assembly. This thesis aims to contribute in bridging these knowledge gaps by investigating the sustainability of bridges with FRP decks and developing a novel panel-level connection for potential swift on-site assembly of FRP bridge deck panels. The sustainability of bridges with FRP decks was evaluated using life-cycle cost (LCC) analysis and life-cycle assessment (LCA) with a focus on carbon emissions. An existing steel-concrete bridge with a deteriorated concrete deck was selected as a case study. Two scenarios were studied and analysed: the total replacement of the bridge and a bridge rehabilitation scenario in which the concrete deck is replaced by an FRP deck. The analyses revealed that the latter scenario contributes to potential cost savings over the life cycle of bridges in addition to a reduced environmental impact in terms of carbon emissions. A novel panel-level connection was developed by following a process in which the client, designer, manufacturer and contractor were involved. Numerical analyses and experimental tests were conducted to investigate the overall structural behaviour and the load-carrying capacity of the developed panel-level connection. The results demonstrated that the connection exhibits sufficient load-carrying capacity and ductility, while the requirements in the serviceability limit state (SLS) were not fully satisfied due to geometric flaws in the connection modules. More experimental studies encompassing specimens with higher level of precision are therefore recommended to obtain enhanced performance in the serviceability limit state...|$|E

40|$|Inducible {{immune defence}} may allow organisms a {{state-dependent}} upregulation of costly immunity {{in order to}} minimize the risk of anticipated future parasitism. The basic costs of elevated immune activity might involve a reduction in other fitness-related traits as well as an increased risk of immunopathology. In male field crickets Gryllus campestris we experimentally investigated the condition-dependent effects of immune system activation in nymphs on immunity and physiological condition during adulthood. Following a nymphal injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharides, adult males showed significantly elevated levels of two major immune parameters, i. e. haemolymph antibacterial activity and the concentration of prophenoloxidase (proPO). By contrast, the active enzyme, phenoloxidase (PO), did not increase, suggesting a strategic long-term upregulation of the inactive proenzyme proPO only. This may help avoid the cytotoxic effects associated with high <b>standing</b> <b>levels</b> of the active enzyme. The nymphal immune insult further caused a reduction in adult haemolymph protein load, suggesting a long-term decline in overall metabolic condition. Nymphal food availability positively affected adult lysozyme activity, while PO and proPO concentrations were not affected. Our data thus suggest the long-term upregulation of immunity in response to antigenic cues as an adaptive, yet costly, invertebrate strategy to improve resistance to future parasitism...|$|R
40|$|Many parasites, {{including}} important {{species that}} affect humans and livestock, must survive the harsh environment of insect guts {{to complete their}} life-cycle. Hence, understanding how insects protect themselves against such parasites has immediate practical implications. Previously, such protection has been thought to consist mainly of mechanical structures and the action of lectins. However, recently it has become apparent that gut infections may interact with the host immune system in more complex ways. Here, using humble bees, Bombus terrestris and their non-invasive gut trypanosome, Crithidia bombi, as a model system we investigated the effects of parasitic infection, host resources and the duration of infections on the host immune system. We found that infection doubled <b>standing</b> <b>levels</b> of immune defence in the haemolymph (the constitutive pro-phenoloxidase system), which {{is used as a}} first, general defence against parasites. However, physical separation of the parasite from the haemolymph suggests the presence of a messenger system between the gut and the genes that control the pro-phenoloxidase system.

Our results suggest a novel and tactical response of insects to gut infections, demonstrating the complexity of such host-parasite systems...|$|R

Populations show strong geographic clustering irrespective of mating system, suggesting that selfing either evolved multiple times or has spread to multiple genetic backgrounds. Diversity is reduced in selfing populations, but not to the extent of the severe loss of variation expected if selfing evolved due to selection for reproductive assurance in connection with strong founder events.
