40|$|The local contact {{search is}} a {{numerical}} procedure of a contact algorithm {{which is used}} for computing of a penetration vector between so-called master and slave segments of contact surfaces. There are several approaches. In this paper the minimum distance problem between the master segment and the integration point of the <b>slave</b> <b>segment</b> is used. For quadrilateral elements this approach leads to the system of two nonlinear equations. For its solution several methods was tested (Newton-Raphson method, least square projection, method of steepest descent, Broyden's method, BFGS method, DFP method and simplex method) and efficiency was compared...|$|E
40|$|As {{confirmed}} by fifteenth-century documentation, Giuliano Marcovaldi, a merchant from Prato established in Ragusa, {{along with some}} Florentine merchants, {{were involved in the}} trade of <b>slaves,</b> a special <b>segment</b> of the commerce relations between the Italian peninsula, Ragusa and the Balkan hinterland. The persons sold were mostly young women, many of Patarine or Orthodox faith, who were to become domestic servants. They were exported from the Balkans by Ragusan merchants, and sold to Italian traders in exchange for woollen cloth and food stuffs, especially wheat...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a distributed approach that scales up to segment tree crowns within a LiDAR point cloud representing an arbitrarily large forested area. The approach uses a single-processor tree segmentation algorithm as a building block {{in order to}} process the data delivered {{in the shape of}} tiles in parallel. The distributed processing is performed in a master-slave manner, in which the master maintains the global map of the tiles and coordinates the <b>slaves</b> that <b>segment</b> tree crowns within and across the boundaries of the tiles. A minimal bias was introduced to the number of detected trees because of trees lying across the tile boundaries, which was quantified and adjusted for. Theoretical and experimental analyses of the runtime of the approach revealed a near linear speedup. The estimated number of trees categorized by crown class and the associated error margins as well as the height distribution of the detected trees aligned well with field estimations, verifying that the distributed approach works correctly. The approach enables providing information of individual tree locations and point cloud segments for a forest-level area in a timely manner, which can be used to create detailed remotely sensed forest inventories. Although the approach was presented for tree segmentation within LiDAR point clouds, the idea can also be generalized to scale up processing other big spatial datasets. Highlights: - A scalable distributed approach for tree segmentation was developed and theoretically analyzed. - ~ 2 million trees in a 7440 ha forest was segmented in 2. 5 hours using 192 cores. - 2 % false positive trees were identified {{as a result of the}} distributed run. - The approach can be used to scale up processing other big spatial dataComment: The replacement version is exactly the same and only the journal biblio information and the DOI of the published version was adde...|$|R
