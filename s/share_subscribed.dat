40|$|Currently {{and in the}} future, users {{demand for}} {{ubiquitous}} network connection {{to interact with the}} world. Moreover, the mobile devices are increasingly widespread and are better equipped in terms of access connections and services support. Mobility management is therefore an intrinsic feature of mobile networks; however, it is not yet ready to support the so called User-provided networks (UPNs), where the network elements can be devices controlled by regular users, or providers, and <b>share</b> <b>subscribed</b> access. In these scenarios, mobility has to be rethought to consider user-centric approaches. This paper discusses the efficiency and applicability of current mobility assumptions in user-centric scenarios, discussing their requirements and solutions addressing several types of networks that may exhibit user-centric characteristics. It also identifies the fundamentals of a user-centric mobility management architecture able to efficiently deal with the dynamicity of the aforementioned scenarios...|$|E

50|$|Vendor finance {{is a form}} of lending {{in which}} a company lends money to be used by the {{borrower}} to buy the vendor's products or property. Vendor finance is usually in the form of deferred loans from, or <b>shares</b> <b>subscribed</b> by, the vendor. The vendor often takes shares in the borrowing company. This category of finance is generally used where the vendor's expectation {{of the value of the}} business is higher than that of the borrower's bankers, and usually at a higher interest rate than would be offered elsewhere.|$|R

50|$|A {{general meeting}} in November {{authorised}} {{an increase in}} the company's borrowing powers from £125,000 to £202,000 and an interest rate of 10 per cent. Liabilities were stated to be £182,000. £150,000 had been raised by shares and only £2,600 by debentures. It was decided to issue £200,000 worth of bonds at 10 per cent. The directors agreed to buy £150,000 provided the other <b>shares</b> <b>subscribed</b> £50,000. If this not happen within 14 days, the works were liable to be sold in discharge of the liabilities. Later more creditors were discovered, increasing the liabilities to £243,000. The company survived this crisis although the bonds may not all have been sold.|$|R
50|$|In September 2016, OncoDNA raised EUR 7.7 {{million in}} private equity. The new <b>shares</b> were <b>subscribed</b> {{by both the}} {{historical}} shareholders (IPG/bio.be, Invest4OncoDNA, Sambrinvest, and Vinsovier) {{as well as a}} group of four new investors (Sofinim NV, an affiliate of Ackermans & van Haaren, SRIW, CPH, and Inventures).|$|R

All common <b>shares</b> were <b>subscribed</b> by the government {{on behalf of the}} veterans, their families and descendants, while the preferred shares were distributed for free among the veterans.|$|R
30|$|Successful {{models of}} data <b>sharing</b> usually <b>subscribe</b> to several common themes. 1) They protect data from {{unauthorized}} access and ensure equitable {{access to and}} distribution of data, without preferential consideration of requests. Because shared databases often contain data owned by both the archivists and collaborating investigators, special privileges by distinct classes of users should be avoided but if required should be explicitly legislated and declared.|$|R
50|$|Founded by Li Shau-kee, {{the company}} was taken public in 1981 by Sun Hung Kai Securities. The shares were {{introduced}} at HK$4 by a novel, geared, method - {{there was to be}} an initial downpayment of HK$1 per <b>share</b> upon <b>subscribing</b> to the offer, with cash calls of another HK$1 six months later. The final HK$2 instalment would be due at the year end.|$|R

50|$|The grounds {{on which}} Semple Stadium is built were {{formerly}} known as Thurles Sportsfield. The site was offered for sale in 1910 at the wish of Canon M.K. Ryan and was purchased by local Gaelic games enthusiasts for £900. To meet {{the cost of the}} purchase, an issue of <b>shares</b> was <b>subscribed</b> by the townspeople. The grounds remained {{in the hands of the}} shareholders until 1956 when they were transferred to the Gaelic Athletic Association.|$|R

50|$|Attracting {{capital was}} a {{continuing}} {{problem for the}} company. Available records do not indicate that at any time more than 70-80% of the authorized <b>shares</b> were <b>subscribed</b> or that more than £6000 (out of an authorized £10000) was raised in this way. A limited amount of money came from canal operations (tolls) but {{for the bulk of}} the needed capital other sources were required. Government financial support was continually necessary to prop up the company. The early 1830s were especially bleak.|$|R

40|$|We examine market timing in {{the equity}} {{issuance}} of firms controlled by large shareholders using a hand-collected data set of controlling shareholders' ownership stakes in Chile between 1990 and 2009. When a firm issues shares, the controlling shareholder can either maintain or change his ownership stake {{depending on how}} many of the new <b>shares</b> he <b>subscribes.</b> Issuance predicts poor future returns and is preceded by high returns, but only when the controlling shareholder's stake is significantly reduced. Consistent with market timing, the results are stronger in the absence of institutional investors and in hot issuance markets...|$|R
50|$|In CLM {{features}} {{are used as}} an abstraction layer between the CLM-system and subscribing systems. A feature string is a valid (as determined by the definitions in the CLM system) complete or partial selection of features that define a product. The feature string acts as a product’s DNA that is <b>shared</b> by all <b>subscribing</b> systems and processes.|$|R
50|$|An {{extremely}} unsavoury episode {{then followed}} of two warring factions on the Board, with considerable adoption of tactical attitudes over Directors' commitment to take shares. Wieland {{and his supporters}} won, and the original directors reluctantly took their <b>subscribed</b> <b>shares.</b> However the available capital still fell considerably short of the sum required to start building the line.|$|R
5000|$|Alabbar, through Alabbar Enterprises, holds 4 {{per cent}} stake in online fashion {{retailer}} Yoox Net-A-Porter Group. This followed his equity investment of US$113 {{million in the}} Milan-listed company in April 2016. [...] Under the deal, Alabbar holds 3,571,428 ordinary shares, and has committed to an 18-month lock-up period on the <b>subscribed</b> <b>shares.</b> Yoox Net-A-Porter said Alabbar ‘would be key in developing its Middle Eastern e-commerce business.’ ...|$|R
5000|$|The Wigtownshire Railway (WR) was {{authorised}} by Act of 18 July 1872, {{with capital}} of £96,000 {{and the usual}} one-third borrowing powers, only to be accessible if a certain proportion of <b>shares</b> had been <b>subscribed.</b> The 1½-mile (2 km) tramway could not be operated by locomotives, nor by stationary engine or as an [...] "atmospheric railway". The main line was to be just over 19 miles (31 km) long.|$|R
50|$|A Dividend Reinvestment Option - {{the first}} {{transaction}} {{of this sort}} to be offered not only by IGD, but by an Italian company, was launched in 2012. The Dividend Reinvestment Option gave shareholders the possibility to reinvest up to 80% of their gross dividends in IGD <b>shares</b> by <b>subscribing</b> a reserved capital increase. As a result, the Company also benefitted from a recapitalization of €13.3 million. On 3 October 2012 the new 2012-2015 Business Plan was presented which, {{with respect to the}} past, focuses more on operational and financial sustainability in order to maintain a prudent and solid profile, as well as limit, to the extent possible, execution risk to exogenous factors. The Plan calls for an EBITDA Margin target of more than 71% by 2015.|$|R
50|$|Since {{then and}} up to the {{founding}} of Amman Stock Exchange, a lot has been achieved. Trading on the Secondary Market rose from JD9.7 million in 1978 to JD3.0 billion in 2013; market capitalization of <b>subscribed</b> <b>shares</b> is currently around JD18.2 billion, as compared to around JD286 million by the end of 1978; and the number of listed companies went up from 66 in 1978 to 240 by the end of 2013.|$|R
500|$|This huge {{volume of}} {{intended}} activity was fuelled by financial speculation—the [...] "railway mania". It appeared that fortunes {{could be made}} by <b>subscribing</b> to <b>shares</b> in new lines, and the subscriber only had to put a small deposit down until construction got under way. Over-optimism led to stark inability to pay up when the calls (for cash on <b>subscribed</b> <b>shares)</b> came in, and suddenly money was impossible to come by. Most of the speculative schemes collapsed at once.|$|R
50|$|Also in 1979, {{under the}} Forestry Incentive Law that was {{established}} on May 8, 1978, Raúl and Rodolfo Gurdián Montealegre formed the company Ahorro Forestal de Costa Rica and acquired 50% of the Cordilleras Centrales <b>shares</b> to later <b>subscribe</b> reforestation contracts. The reforestation project subsequently began and a 7.5-kilometre (4.6-miles) road was built with its respective bridges communicating San Rafael, Vara Blanca, with the forested {{areas of the}} property and edge of the Braulio Carrillo National Park.|$|R

50|$|PACE {{specializes in}} {{condominium}} development, and in 2013 {{listed on the}} Stock Exchange of Thailand, trading under the symbol, PACE, with financial advisers, Asia Plus. PACE offered 600 million shares, 29.2 percent of the company, in an IPO during a subscription period from 29-31 July 2013, with official trading commencing in August 2013. The share price was set at 3.50 baht per share, and following the subscription period, the <b>shares</b> were fully <b>subscribed</b> {{on the first day}} of trading, 7 August 2013.|$|R
50|$|In 1879, HK Notnagel & Co. of Altona, a lessee of Himmelmoor, {{located in}} Quickborn, where peat was mined for heating, {{called for the}} {{construction}} of a railway for the transport of peat. The municipalities of Quickborn and Kaltenkirchen and the then independent town of Altona supported this project. After the founding of the Altona-Kaltenkirchner Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft (Altona-Kaltenkirchen Railway Company, AKE) in 1883 and an expression of support from the Emperor on 27 April 1883, the construction of the new railway had already started in the autumn of 1883. On 8 September 1884, passenger traffic commenced on the line from Gählerplatz in Altona to Kaltenkirchen and on 24 November of the same year the carriage of freight traffic commenced. The <b>shares</b> were <b>subscribed</b> by the town of Altona, the communities of Quickborn, Ulzburg and Kaltenkirchen and the construction company Kintzel & Lauser.|$|R
50|$|The Asian Development Bank Institute {{published}} {{a report in}} 2010 which said that the region requires $8 trillion to be invested from 2010 to 2020 in infrastructure for the region to continue economic development. In a 2014 editorial, The Guardian newspaper wrote that the new bank could allow Chinese capital to finance these projects and allow it a greater {{role to play in}} the economic development of the region commensurate with its growing economic and political clout. But until March 2015, China in the ADB has only 5.47 percent voting right, while Japan and US have a combined 26 percent voting right (13 percent each) with a <b>share</b> in <b>subscribed</b> capital of 15.7 percent and 15.6 percent, respectively. Dominance by both countries and slow reforms underlie China's wish to establish the AIIB, while both countries worry about China's increasing influence.|$|R
50|$|The early {{euphoria}} {{turned to}} great difficulty in raising finance for construction. 4,000 of the 15,000 <b>subscribed</b> <b>shares</b> were forfeited for non-payment of calls before {{the line was}} built. A contract was let {{for the first part}} of the line, from a temporary terminus at Pylle Hill, west of the New Cut (an arm of the River Avon). The position improved somewhat in 1838, and indeed the Company obtained Parliamentary powers for four short branches: of these only one, to Weston-super-Mare, was actually built.|$|R
50|$|To insure a {{sound base}} for operations, Keys {{proposed}} an initial <b>subscribed</b> <b>share</b> capital of $2 million, {{many times that}} of other early airlines. Keys raised $1 million through his New York contacts and Fritsche raised $500,000 from Detroit interests. After further fund raising, the remaining $500,000 was subscribed by the sons of several leading Chicago business men. This enabled National Air Transport Inc. (NAT) to be incorporated {{in the state of}} Delaware on 21 May 1925. The total authorized issued share capital was fixed at an unprecedented $10 million.|$|R
5|$|While he was {{employed}} at the West Virginia State Capitol, White began studying jurisprudence with legal coursebooks. He undertook {{his study of}} jurisprudence in {{the law firm of}} Chilton, MacCorkle and Chilton in Charleston. White was admitted to the bar in 1897 and afterward established a law practice in Charleston. White's practice began arguing cases in county, state, and federal level courts within West Virginia. On December 19, 1901, the West Virginia Secretary of State office issued a charter authorizing $100,000 in capital stock for the incorporation of Midland Railway, of which White was a corporator with one <b>subscribed</b> <b>share</b> of $100.|$|R
50|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{long-term}} financial security, in 1997 the conversion into a corporation (Aktiengesellschaft) was decided: about 550 shareholders have been <b>subscribed</b> <b>share</b> capital for approximately 1,500,000 Swiss Francs. In May 2012, an authorized capital increase has been applied for, to which alongside the existing shareholders, other people may participate (legal and natural personalities), in all an additional a share capital {{in the amount of}} CHF 656,000, with the proviso that former shareholders may exercise pre-emptive rights of one share for two existing one. This predominantly may pre-finance the growing program and save the long-term liquidity.|$|R
