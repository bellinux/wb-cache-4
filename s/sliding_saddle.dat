5000|$|Roberts built a {{range of}} machine tools, some to his own design, the first being a gear-cutting machine. For {{accurately}} checking {{the dimensions of the}} gears he adapted the sector, which he developed for sale to other engineers. [...] Roberts adopted rotary cutters, which he had seen used at Maudslays. This is one of the earliest records of a milling cutter used in engineering. In 1816 he made the first reliable wet gas meter. In 1817 he made a lathe able to turn work 6 ft. This had a back gear to give an increased range of speeds, and a <b>sliding</b> <b>saddle</b> to move the tool along the work. The saddle was driven by a screw through gearing which could be disengaged when the end of the cut was reached. Also in 1817 he built a planing machine to allow the machining of flat surfaces. Previous to this flat surfaces were laboriously made by hand with the fitter using hammers and chisels, files and scrapers to get a true surface.|$|E

5000|$|Difficult {{to hold on}} <b>saddle.</b> If <b>saddle</b> <b>slides</b> forward, it can put {{weight on}} the forehand, interfering with balance and {{restrict}} the shoulder movement by saddle and rider movement, causing shortened stride, interfering or forging.|$|R
60|$|The sport {{began with}} some fancy riding in which {{eight of the}} cowboys, four from each ranch, participated. The cowboys would ride like the wind and leap off and on their steeds, turn from frontwards to backwards, <b>slide</b> from the <b>saddle</b> under their horses' necks and up into the saddle again, and lean low to catch up {{handkerchiefs}} and hats left on the grass for that purpose. Then they did some fancy vaulting, over bars and brushwood, and while riding two and even four horses.|$|R
50|$|The saddle {{is held in}} {{position}} by a girth strapped firmly around the heartgirth area of the horse. When traces are used, a back band runs through the saddle, joining at the sides to a loose strap under the belly, the 'belly band'; both attach to loops around the shafts or to a pole. The back band may be fixed {{or it may be}} free to <b>slide</b> through the <b>saddle</b> from side to side; it is normally fixed for a four-wheeled vehicle with independently hinged shafts, but sliding for a vehicle with rigid shafts (such as a two-wheeled cart). This allows the horse to twist in the shafts on a side-slope.|$|R
6000|$|Now the Khan {{had ridden}} up and sat upon his horse glowering at us, {{and his face}} was like the face of a devil. I had hoped that he might fear to attack, but the moment I saw his eyes, I knew that this would not be. He was quite mad with hate, jealousy, and the long-drawn {{excitement}} of the hunt, and had come to kill or be killed. <b>Sliding</b> from the <b>saddle,</b> he drew his short sword--for either he had lost his spear or had brought none--and made a hissing noise to the two dogs, pointing at me with the sword. I saw them spring and I saw him rush at Leo, and after that who can tell exactly what happened? ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. Experimental {{research}} of technical state change in metal-metal sealing units of pneumatic valve with two-positioned polarized electromagnetic drive. Design/methodology/approach. It {{has been shown}} that the work peculiarity of pneumatic valves with two-positioned electromagnetic drive and with metal-metal sealing is shock loads during its closure and opening. Such loads lead to intensive wearing process and increasing of gas leakage through the sealing units of different design and made of different materials. It has been experimentally confirmed, that the effective way of wear intensiveness decreasing in metal-metal sealing units is the use of special damping units in the valve Findings. As a result of experimental research it was concluded that including in the valve design of special damping device reduces the stress in the sealing unit elements, which occurs in the sealing units elements during the valve closing, and, as a result, the wear intensiveness of the sealing unit decreases. Usage of less wear-resisting, comparatively to the stainless steel 08 ? 18 ? 10 ? materials leads to the increase of wear intensiveness of the sealing unit contact surfaces. Originality/value. Comparative analysis of the obtained experimental dependencies shows, that including of the damping device decreases the intensiveness of gas leakage increase through the closed valve, which occurs with the increase of the operational cycles. Damping element provides the kinetic energy dissipation that decreases the wear speed of the sealing surfaces of the valve <b>slide</b> and the <b>saddle.</b> ? ?????? ????????? ????????????????? ???????????? ????????? ???????????? ????????? ???????? ????? ???? ??????? ? ??????? ?????????????? ???????? ? ??????????????? ?????????????? ???????????????? ????????. ????????????, ??? ???????????? ???????????????? ????? ???????????????? ???????? ???????? ????????????? ??????? ???????? ?? ???????? ????????? ???? ??????? ??? ??? ????????, ??? ???????? ? ??????????? ????????? ?????? ? ?????????? ???????? ???? ????? ?????? ? ???????? ?????????. ???????????? ????????????????? ??????????? ?????????? ???????? ???? ????? ???????? ???? ??????? ?????????? ??????????????? ?????????? ? ?????????????? ????????? ??????????????? ??????????. ???????????????? ????????????, ??? ??????????? ???????? ?????????? ????????????? ?????? ????????? ????????? ???? ??????? ???? ??????? ? ??????? ???????? ?????????? ??????????? ???????????? ????????? ? ??????????? ???????...|$|R
40|$|FEM-analysis of {{dynamics}} in the bearing system of a heavy-duty machine tool {{has been carried}} out in the paper. This is a prospective variant for a large-size multi-purpose machine tool with a horizontal <b>sliding</b> ram. A <b>saddle</b> and a ram are moving vertically along a subtle mono-column. A rigid double-column is used in the existing analog machine tool. A static, modal and harmonic analysis of the bearing system with the mono-column has been made in the paper. It has been done with the help of FEM-simulation prior to fabrication of a prototype sample. Previously conducted calculations for the analog machine tool have shown good compatibility of FEM-calculation with experiments. Six common machine tool resonances have been revealed for the bearing system. Their oscillating cutting forces are actively exciting three-four resonance modes. Ranges of a flexure-torsion resonance (20 – 40 Hz) and nose-diving resonances (70 – 90 Hz) have been determined in the paper. The paper shows that the range of multi-wave resonances starts significantly higher from 140 Hz. These resonances are interconnected with bending oscillations of the ram and bucklings of the column walls which are matched with the oscillations. The paper demonstrates stability in resonance pattern. The torsional resonance of the column on the frequency of nearly 40 Hz is considered as the more dangerous one. Spindle rigidity goes down up to 3. 8 Н/μm. It is possible to observe self-stabilization of the torsional resonance. Frequency of the torsional oscillations is practically unchangeable when there is a lifting or lowering down of the saddle and the ram. It is related to the migration of dynamical axis of torsion. Frequency-response characteristics of the bearing system have been constructed for various saddle positions on the column. Three frequency intervals that make it possible to carry out machining operation have been determined in the paper. The first interval is a static one. The machine tool with a mono-column comes short of the analog machine tool in this interval. The main reason of it is low static rigidity of the subtle column. The second interval is narrow and it is located between flexure-torsion and nose-diving resonances. The third interval is considered as the most efficient one. The interval contains a section of inter-range pause between general machine tool and multi-wave resonances. In this case it is possible to observe a significant increase of the dynamic rigidity on the spindle that compensates the column subtility. High potential of the dynamic rigidity has been revealed {{in the direction of the}} ram axis (> 2000 Н/μm). The paper shows liability of the machine tool to displacement crossings during oscillations. Peculiar features of this effect have been discussed in the paper. The diagram with a mono-column is recommended for practical application. The main condition is a transition to high-speed drive within the framework of concept on high-speed machining. It is necessary to ensure rigidity of the axial feed drive system. </p...|$|R
