5000|$|In 1933 Myron Scott, a {{photographer}} for Dayton, Ohio newspaper Dayton Daily News, {{put together an}} impromptu race for 19 boys. There was so much interest that Scott arranged a bigger race, with prize money for August 19. [...] "An amazing crowd of 362 kids showed up with homemade cars built of orange crates, <b>sheet</b> tin, <b>wagon</b> and baby-buggy wheels...." ...|$|R
60|$|After {{striking}} dry country Ranse {{had removed}} the <b>wagon</b> <b>sheet</b> from the bows and thrown {{it over the}} goods in the wagon. Six pair of hasty hands dragged it off and grabbled beneath the sacks and blankets for the cases of tobacco.|$|R
25|$|The Second World War {{was from}} 1939 to 1945, {{so most of}} the {{importance}} has dropped. There probably would have been an increase in <b>wagon</b> <b>sheet</b> production. It is thought that there is also damage again on the water tower {{at the back of the}} site.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{under the}} <b>wagon</b> <b>sheet,</b> boys," [...] he said. [...] "I know what you're waiting for. If Sam lets it run out again we'll use those yellow shoes of his for a target. There's two cases. Pull 'em out and light up. I know you all want a smoke." ...|$|R
5000|$|A train {{using the}} branch was {{involved}} in a fatal accident on 11 February 1942. Metal <b>sheets</b> in a <b>wagon</b> being shunted became dislodged and protruded into the path of a troop train on the adjacent [...] "Down" [...] (northbound) ex-GCR main line. The metal sliced into some of the coaches killing several sailors and injuring more.|$|R
50|$|New Holland was {{a railway}} community, the {{majority}} of the housing being built by the company to house its workers. It played an important part in railway life for it was here that the railway company laundry was situated and special laundry vans brought the soiled washing from the companies stations, restaurant cars and hotels. Also centred here were the company's <b>wagon</b> <b>sheet</b> repair shops, skills used in the repair of sails could be put to a railway use.|$|R
5000|$|For 1968, all new US {{cars were}} {{equipped}} with {{front and rear}} side marker lights. Chrysler bumpers, grille, hood, deck lid, rear fascia and lamps all changed significantly, although side <b>sheet</b> metal, <b>wagon</b> tailgate and rear lamps remained the same. Functionally, there were few changes. Better breathing cylinder heads boosted output of the standard 383 cu. in. 2BBL V8 to 290 HP. Front disc brakes returned to the options list, while front drum brakes and size 8.85x14 tires were standard. Inside, standard notchback and optional 50/50 front seats continued, sharing seat and door trim patterns with the Newport Custom series. The big change in Town & Country appearance {{came in the form}} of simulated walnut grain paneling, filling the coved portion of the body sides and surrounded by a stainless steel molding. The wood paneling was standard on all Town & Country wagons, with a delete option offered ...|$|R
50|$|China clay traffic {{started in}} 1862 and {{eventually}} English China Clays Lovering Pochin had six clay dries at Wenford sidings {{served by a}} pipe delivering clay slurry from Stannon Moor over four miles distant. Initially there was a loop serving dries 1 and 2, with a line extending back then diverging to give access to dries 3 to 6 which were set back further from the main running line. The {{first part of the}} loop by dries 3-6 and associated access, including the facing point, were removed between 1920 and 1922, at which time the loop to dries 1 and 2 was extended by 9 chains towards Wenfordbridge. Traffic to the dries was coal inward and china clay outward; high quality bagged clay in vans and lower quality in <b>sheeted</b> open <b>wagons</b> called clay hoods. After the closure of Wenfordbridge in 1971 the line ended just beyond the clay dries, 11 miles and 71 chains from Wadebridge. The line closed completely on 3 October 1983.|$|R
2500|$|The main {{work for}} the rest of its life was <b>wagon</b> <b>sheet</b> production. This carried on right up into {{ownership}} by British Railways. This ownership take over was on 1 January 1948. At first, BR was kind to the works. A new engine shed was built in 1951 {{on the site of the}} wooden one. This building could hold 12 engines. Like any other railway motive power depot or works site, Melton Constable used stationary boilers to raise steam needed for machinery. It was noted that old J15 locomotives were used for this duty. In the late 1950s most of the former M was closed and lifted, the line from Sheringham to Melton Constable surviving until the Beeching Axe ...|$|R
50|$|The York and North Midland Railway built a shed in this area, {{but this}} was {{demolished}} when the new station was built in 1877. Another four engine sheds were built in this area. The first two were roundhouses completed in 1849/50 and 1851/2 each with 16 stalls and 42-foot turntables. These were designed by the YNMR engineer in chief Thomas Cabry. One of the roundhouses was out of use by 1923 and used for <b>wagon</b> <b>sheet</b> repairs. Later a NER petrol engined saloon was kept there. The earlier roundhouse building was destroyed by fire in October 1921. The second roundhouse remained in use until 1961 although largely for stabling purposes. The two roundhouses were conjoined.|$|R
50|$|Operation of the M&GN {{was taken}} over by the London and North Eastern Railway on 1 October 1936 which {{transferred}} all locomotive operations to its Stratford works as part of a move to rationalise functions of the Joint system. Melton Constable Works ceased to repair locomotives after this date, but the facilities continued to be used for wagon repairs and the scrapping of redundant rolling stock. Further rationalisation in 1945 left Melton Constable as a <b>wagon</b> <b>sheet</b> works, whilst declining traffic served to highlight the duplication of facilities between the M&GN and other Great Eastern lines. Most of the M&GN closed on 28 February 1959, leaving Melton Constable as the terminus of a branch from Sheringham until 4 April 1964 when it was closed to passengers.|$|R

6000|$|... "It is," [...] said Jeff. [...] "I {{never told}} you about the time when me and Andy Tucker was philanthropists, did I? It was eight years ago in Arizona. Andy and me was out in the Gila {{mountains}} with a two-horse wagon prospecting for silver. We struck it, and sold out to parties in Tucson for $25,000. They paid our check at the bank in silver--a thousand dollars in a sack. We loaded it in our wagon and drove east a hundred miles before we recovered our presence of intellect. Twenty-five thousand dollars doesn't sound like so much when you're reading the annual report of the Pennsylvania Railroad or listening to an actor talking about his salary; but when you can raise up a <b>wagon</b> <b>sheet</b> and kick around your bootheel and hear every one of 'em ring against another it makes you feel like you was a night-and-day bank with the clock striking twelve.|$|R
5000|$|The Bristol and Exeter Railway was {{initially}} {{operated by the}} Great Western Railway but from 1 May 1849 the company operated its own trains. Coke ovens, to provide fuel for the locomotives, and workshops to build and maintain the carriages and wagons, were built {{to the west of}} the line between Bridgwater station and the river [...] - [...] this is the nearest station to the halfway point on the line. They closed following a fire on 25 August 1947, although by this time they were only repairing <b>wagon</b> <b>sheets</b> (i.e. canvas covers). Other local industries linked with the railway were John Browne's Brick and Tile Works, which were owned by a director of the railway and supplied materials to the Great Western and associated companies; and George Hennet's iron works (later Bridgwater Engineering Company) which made track, signals and wagons for several different companies including atmospheric railway pipes for the South Devon Railway Company.|$|R
50|$|A {{feasibility}} study {{to build a}} railway from Strathmore to Dundee was proposed in 1825, and {{the first meeting of}} the Dundee and Newtyle Railway Company took place the following year. Construction started rapidly, and the section from Hatton to Balbeuchley was completed by 1827. The line opened on 16 December 1831. The coaches were, at first, drawn up the Hatton incline by a newly installed stationary engine, with horses providing the power {{from the top of the}} incline. The horses were assisted by a <b>wagon</b> <b>sheet</b> on a pole attached to the carriage to harness favourable winds. A second stationary engine was installed at Balbeuchley the following year, and in 1833 two steam engines, the Earl of Airlie and the Lord Wharncliffe, replaced horses on the level sections. Coal and lime were carried from Dundee, while in the other direction, fruit was transported and stone from local quarries provided building material for the rapidly expanding city. In addition, 31,000 passengers were being carried by 1833. In 1834 a locomotive derailment at Pitpointie resulted in the death of John Anderson, the miller at Auchterhouse.|$|R
2500|$|For 1961, new 2-door {{sedan and}} hardtop models were released, but no {{changes were made}} to the 4-door sedan and <b>wagon</b> <b>sheet</b> metal. The {{interior}} and exterior trim were changed to provide model year differentiation, a mild form of planned obsolescence. The radiator grille stamping was the same as in 1960, but for 1961 it was painted with a pattern of black squares. The central grille ornament was still pulled from the bottom to release the hood, but it was now faced with an emblem having a white field with the blue-and-red stylized [...] "V" [...] Valiant logo, rather than 1960's red field with gold script [...] "Valiant" [...] callout. The side trim was changed; a [...] stainless spear was placed at the rear of each tailfin crease, a hockey stick-shaped trim was applied to the lower break line, and the front fender/door crease was capped with a long stainless spear. The tailfins were each topped with three transverse chrome strips, and a large horizontal emblem containing a round plastic [...] "V200" [...] callout was centered in the deck lid's spare-tire stamping. Matching round [...] "V200" [...] callouts were placed in round housings at the midpoint of the front fender spears. Inside the car, the instrument cluster was largely carried over, but 1960's black gauges with white callouts gave way to 1961's white gauges with black callouts.|$|R
