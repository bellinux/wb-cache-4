5|$|The Danube crested newt's {{back and}} sides are dark brown with black spots and white <b>stippling.</b> The belly is orange to red (in other crested newts, {{it is usually}} yellow or orange–yellow), with small or {{medium-sized}} black blotches that have sharp edges. Like all crested newts, T.dobrogicus males develop a crest on their back and tail during breeding phase, which can be quite high and jagged and usually starts between the eyes and nostrils. Another feature of males at breeding season is a bluish-white stripe along the tail.|$|E

5|$|Crested newts {{are dark}} brown, with black {{spots on the}} sides, and white <b>stippling</b> in some species. Their belly is yellow to orange with black blotches, forming a pattern {{characteristic}} for individuals. Females and juveniles of some species have a yellow line running down their back and tail. During breeding phase, crested newts change in appearance, most markedly the males. These develop a skin seam running along their back and tail; this crest is the namesake feature of the crested newts and can be up to 1.5cm high and very jagged in the northern crested newt. Another feature of males at breeding time is a silvery-white band {{along the sides of}} the tail.|$|E

25|$|Effects not {{generally}} associated with ballpoint pens can be achieved. Traditional pen-and-ink {{techniques such as}} <b>stippling</b> and cross-hatching {{can be used to}} create half-tones or the illusion of form and volume. For artists whose interests necessitate precision line-work, ballpoints are an obvious attraction; ballpoint pens allow for sharp lines not as effectively executed using a brush. Finely applied, the resulting imagery has been mistaken for airbrushed artwork and photography, causing reactions of disbelief which ballpoint artist Lennie Mace refers to as the Wow Factor.|$|E
25|$|Drawing is a {{means of}} making a picture, using any {{of a wide variety of}} tools and techniques. It {{generally}} involves making marks on a surface by applying pressure from a tool, or moving a tool across a surface. Common tools are graphite pencils, pen and ink, inked brushes, wax color pencils, crayons, charcoals, pastels, and markers. Digital tools that simulate the effects of these are also used. The main techniques used in drawing are: line drawing, hatching, crosshatching, random hatching, scribbling, <b>stippling,</b> and blending. A computer aided designer who excels in technical drawing is referred to as a draftsman or draughtsman.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this work, {{we present}} an {{automated}} system for creat-ing hedcut illustrations, portraits rendered using small image feature aligned dots (<b>stipples).</b> We utilize edge detection and shading cues from the input photograph to direct <b>stipple</b> placement within the image. Both image edges and isophotes are extracted {{as a means}} of describing the image feature and shading information. Edge features and isophotes are then assigned different priorities, with isophotes being assigned the high-est priority to enhance the depth perception within the hedcut portrait. Priority assignment dictates the <b>stipple</b> alignment and spacing. Finally, <b>stipple</b> size is {{based on the number of}} points and intensity and the gra-dient magnitude of the input image. ...|$|R

25|$|Over {{most of the}} range, acorns fall in October. A {{variety of}} mammals and birds eat them, {{including}} the acorn woodpecker, California scrub jay, yellow-billed magpie, and California ground squirrel. The acorns are also attacked by bruchid beetles, but can survive moderate levels of infestation. Surviving acorns all germinate in their first winter, and none remain by mid-winter. The acorns are medium to dark brown and range from two to three centimeters (0.8-1.2 inches) in length. The caps have deep <b>stippling</b> and are found most often as singlets, but occasionally as doublets. The Concow tribe call the acorns lō-ē’ (Konkow language).|$|E
25|$|In the 1890s, on a {{visit to}} England, Hills became fascinated by {{miniature}} paintings on ivory. She taught herself the painstaking technique and by 1893 had completed a series of miniature portraits of girls from her hometown. These Seven Pretty Girls of Newburyport, which launched her on a decades-long career as a miniature portrait painter, are now {{in the collection of the}} Boston Museum of Fine Arts along with other of her miniature paintings. She was considered one of the best miniature painters in America and something of an innovator in the medium, especially in her use of broad paint handling, bright colors, and line work in place of traditional <b>stippling.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cape cobras {{vary widely}} in colouration, from yellow through golden brown to dark brown and even black. In addition, {{individuals}} show a varying degree of black or pale <b>stippling</b> and blotches, and although colour and marking are geographically related, {{it is also}} possible to observe virtually all colour varieties at one location. For example, the Kalahari Desert specimens in Botswana and Namibia are usually more consistently yellow than the more southerly populations. However, at De Hoop, and other specific locations in the Western Cape, all colour variations have been recorded. Juvenile specimens generally have conspicuously dark throats extending down the belly for the width of a dozen or so ventral scales. The colour fades during the first year or two of life, but while it lasts it commonly leads laymen to confuse the juvenile Cape cobra with the Rinkhals spitting cobra.|$|E
5000|$|These {{engravings}} are in {{a combination}} of line and <b>stipple</b> work, {{and in the case}} of three of them (see gallery: The Old Shepherd, The Young Shepherd and The Astrologer), there are first states which are purely in line-work. The plates were later reworked in <b>stipple</b> work, in at least one case after a considerable number of impressions of the first state had been taken. The final group of prints are almost entirely in <b>stipple,</b> except for the main outlines. [...] There are also some prints in Campagnola's manner of which the authorship is disputed.|$|R

25|$|During Blake's {{training}} as a professional copy engraver with James Basire during the 1770s, the most common method of engraving was <b>stippling,</b> which was thought to give a more accurate impression of the original picture than the previously dominant method, line engraving. Etching was also commonly used for layering in such aspects as landscape and background. All traditional methods of engraving and etching were intaglio, which meant that the design's outline was traced with a needle through an acid-resistant 'ground' which had been poured over the copperplate. The plate was then covered with acid, and the engraver went over the incised lines with a burin to allow the acid to bite into the furrows and eat into the copper itself. The acid would then be poured off, leaving the design incised on the plate. The engraver would then engrave the plate's entire surface with a web of crosshatched lines, before pouring the ink onto the plate and transferring it to the printing press.|$|E
500|$|Art {{historian}} Dale Johnson described Beauty Revealed as [...] "strikingly realistic", demonstrative of Goodridge's {{ability to}} portray nuanced lights and shadows. She found the <b>stippling</b> and hatching used {{in creating the}} painting to be delicate. Writing in Antiques in 2012, Randall L. Holton and Charles A. Gilday said that the painting continued to present a self which evokes a [...] "frisson of erotic possibility".|$|E
500|$|The folio and the {{illustrated}} Shakespeare edition were [...] "by far {{the largest}} single engraving enterprise ever undertaken in England". As print collector and dealer Christopher Lennox-Boyd explains, [...] "had there not been a market for such engravings, {{not one of the}} paintings would have been commissioned, and few, if any, of the artists would have risked painting such elaborate compositions". Scholars believe that a variety of engraving methods were employed and that line engraving was the [...] "preferred medium" [...] because it was [...] "clear and hardwearing" [...] and because it had a high reputation. Stipple engraving, which was quicker and often used to produce shading effects, wore out quicker and was valued less. Many plates were a mixture of both. Several scholars have suggested that mezzotint and aquatint were also used. Lennox-Boyd, however, claims that [...] "close examination of the plates confirms" [...] that these two methods were not used and argues that they were [...] "totally unsuitable": [...] mezzotint wore quickly and aquatint was too new (there would not have been enough artists capable of executing it). Most of Boydell's engravers were also trained artists; for example, Bartolozzi was renowned for his <b>stippling</b> technique.|$|E

2500|$|The {{parasitised}} {{red blood}} cell is up to {{twice as large as}} a normal red cell and Schüffner's dots (also known as Schüffner's <b>stippling</b> or Schüffner's granules) are seen on the infected cell's surface. Schüffner's dots have a spotted appearance, [...] varying in color from light pink, to red, to red-yellow, as coloured with Romanovsky stains. The parasite within it is often wildly irregular in shape (described as [...] "amoeboid"). [...] of P. vivax have up to twenty merozoites within them. [...] It is rare to see cells with more than one parasite within them. [...] Merozoites will only attach to immature blood cell (reticulocytes) and therefore it is unusual to see more than 3% of all circulating erythrocytes parasitised.|$|E
2500|$|In {{traditional}} engraving, {{which is}} a purely linear medium, the impression of half-tones was created by making many very thin parallel lines, a technique called hatching. When two sets of parallel-line hatchings intersected each other for higher density, the resulting pattern was known as cross-hatching. Patterns of dots were also used in a technique called <b>stippling,</b> first used around 1505 by Giulio Campagnola. Claude Mellan {{was one of many}} 17th-century engravers with a very well-developed technique of using parallel lines of varying thickness (known as the [...] "swelling line") to give subtle effects of tone (as was Goltzius) – see picture below. One famous example is his Sudarium of Saint Veronica (1649), an engraving of the face of Jesus made from a single spiraling line that starts at the tip of Jesus's nose.|$|E
