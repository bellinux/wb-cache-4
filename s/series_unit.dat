2500|$|But the {{remaining}} companies after ARP's demise that had produced analog synthesizers rapidly {{began to feel}} the stress. [...] Roland and Korg also of Japan maintained with some innovations {{of their own and}} each had 'hit' keyboards (the D50 from Roland and M1 from Korg in the later 1980s) I've heard that total DX <b>series</b> <b>unit</b> sales were on the order of 1 Million. [...] The others from Roland and Korg over 250,000. The success of the D50 and M1 was riding {{on the back of the}} Kurzweil K250 which first really applied this technology well in 1984. [...] This machine was the first full digital workstation with facilities to sample acoustic sounds with a microphone and play them back with a rate that is proportioned for the note being struck. [...] Many great samples were included in the unit including a piano sound that is still used in the 2000s. [...] And the samples can be routed through a synthesizer architecture of some kind.|$|E

50|$|A {{quadrature}} booster typically {{consists of}} two separate transformers: a shunt unit and a <b>series</b> <b>unit.</b> The shunt unit has its windings connected across the phases, so it produces output voltages shifted by 90° {{with respect to the}} supply. Its output is then applied as input to the <b>series</b> <b>unit,</b> which, because its secondary winding is in series with the main circuit, adds the phase-shifted component. The overall output voltage is hence the vector sum of the supply voltage and the 90° quadrature component.|$|E
