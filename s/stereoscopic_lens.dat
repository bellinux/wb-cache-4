40|$|The {{increased}} {{popularity of}} stereo photography {{due to the}} availability of <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>lens</b> and cameras has aroused research interest in stereo image editing. In this paper, we present an automatic, aesthetic-based warping approach to recompose {{both the left and}} right stereo image pair simultaneously using a global optimization algorithm. To maximize image aesthetics, we minimize a set of aesthetics errors formulated based on selected photographic composition rules during the warping process. In addition, our algorithm attempts to preserve the stereoscopic properties by minimizing disparity change and vertical drift in the resulting image. Experimental results shows that our approach successfully relocate salient objects according to the selected photographic rules to enhance compositional aesthetics and maintain disparity consistency to create a comfortable 3 D viewing experience...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this in vitro {{quantitative}} laboratorial study is to compare the ability of three filling techniques to fill simulated lateral canals. Methods: Thirty extracted, single-rooted human teeth were used. After cleaning and shaping, three lateral canals were created, one in each third. The teeth were randomly separated into three groups: continuous wave of condensation (Group 1); thermomechanical compaction (Group 2); and lateral condensation (Group 3). The teeth were cross-sectioned, making the cut through points over the lateral canals; thus, 90 specimens were obtained. Each specimen was immersed in a polyester resin, and the blocks were polished. Images were obtained using a <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>lens</b> (40 x). Radiographic analysis was performed, followed by a filling linear measure using the Image Tool 3. 0 program (University of Texas). Data were statistically analyzed using SPSS 12. 0 for Windows (Kruskal-Wallis test). Results: A greater number of simulated lateral canals were obturated in Groups 1 and 2. Group 2 presented {{the largest percentage of}} linear measure of lateral canals filling with gutta-percha and sealer. No statistical differences were found between Group 1 and Group 2 when we analyzed the filling with gutta-percha and sealer or just sealer (P>. 05). Conclusions: Thermoplasticized gutta-percha filling techniques (Groups 1 and 2) are better for filling lateral canal with gutta-percha and sealer or with just sealer than lateral condensation (Grou...|$|E
40|$|Abstract To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} rewetting solutions on bond strength to root dentin of conventional gutta-percha (GP) or niobium phosphate glass-based gutta-percha (GNb) associated with a bioceramic sealer. The root canals of 80 human mandibular premolars were prepared using nickel-titanium instruments and irrigation with sodium hypochlorite and EDTA. The teeth were randomly divided into four groups according to the gutta-percha used: GNb or GP associated with EndoSequence BC Sealer (BC) and the solution for rewetting dentin before filling (distilled water; phosphate buffer saline solution - PBS; simulated body fluid – SBF; or no solution). The root canals were filled with a single cone using warm vertical condensation. Micropush-out bond strengths associated with the filling materials in slices from middle root thirds was determined 30 days after root filling. The failure mode was analyzed with <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>lens.</b> The data were statistically analyzed by two-way ANOVA and Holm-Sidak test (p < 0. 05). There was {{significant difference in the}} types of gutta-percha (p < 0. 001) and in the different rewetting solutions (p = 0. 003). The interaction between gutta-percha and rewetting solutions was not significant (p = 0. 53). The SBF solution provided an increase in bond strength for both gutta-percha solutions. The GNb+BC (3. 42 MPa) association increased bond strength when compared with GP+BC (2. 0 MPa). The use of SBF as a dentin rewetting solution increased bond strength in the groups studied. Association of GNb with bioceramic sealer was beneficial, increasing the bond strength to dentin when compared with the association with GP...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Objectives To confirm if a real inner descend of testis occurs, {{correlating}} the testicular {{position with}} fetal parameters and analyzing {{the position of}} the testes relative to the internal ring. Material and Methods Twenty nine human fetuses between 13 and 23 weeks post conception (WPC) were studied. The fetuses were carefully dissected {{with the aid of a}} <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>lens</b> with 16 / 25 X magnification and testicular position observed. With the aid of a digital pachymeter the distance between the lower pole of the kidney and the upper extremity of the testis (DK-T) was measured to show {{the position of the}} testis. During the dissection we also indicated the position of the testes relative to the internal ring. Means were statistically compared using simple linear regression and the paired T-test. Results The 58 testes had abdominal position. The DK-T in the right side measured between 0. 17 and 1. 82 cm (mean= 0. 79 cm) and in the left side it was between 0. 12 and 1. 84 cm (mean= 0. 87 cm), without statistically differences (p= 0. 0557). The linear regression analysis indicated that DK-T in both sides correlated significantly and positively with fetal age. All fetuses with more than 20 WPC, heavier than 350 g and with CRL over 22 cm had a greater distance than the average DK-T. We xobserved that the 58 testis remains adjacent to the internal ring throughout the period studied. Conclusions The testes remains adjacent to the internal ring throughout the period studied, indicating that there is no real trans-abdominal testicular descent during the second gestational trimester...|$|E

40|$|As the {{adaptation}} of titanium crowns obtained by Rematitan Plus investment, specific for titanium, is not recognized to be suitable, this study evaluated {{the effect of the}} concentration of the specific liquid and the temperature of the mold of investments on the internal misfit of crowns cast on commercially pure titanium. Individual dies of epoxy resin were obtained, representing teeth prepared for full-crown restoration with a 6 -degree axial surface convergence angle and shoulder (1. 0 mm). For the waxing of each crown, a ring-shaped stainless steel matrix (8. 0 mm internal diameter; 7. 5 mm height) was adapted above the individual dies of epoxy resin. The Rematian Plus investment was mixed according to the manufacturer's instructions using two different concentrations of the specific liquid: 100 %, 75 %. Casting was performed in a Discovery Plasma Ar-arc vacuum-pressure casting machine with molds at temperatures of 430 °C, 515 °C and 600 °C. The crowns were cleaned individually in a solution (1 % HF + 13 % HNO 3) for 10 min using a ultrasonic cleaner, with no internal adaptations, and luted with zinc phosphate cement under a 5 kg static load. The crown and die assemblies were embedded in resin and sectioned longitudinally. The area occupied by cement was observed using <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>lens</b> (10 X) and measured by the Leica Qwin image analysis system (mm 2). The data for each experimental condition (n= 8) were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test (á= 0. 05).

The lowest means (±SD) of internal misfit were obtained for the 430 °C/ 100 %: (7. 25 mm 2 ± 1. 59) and 600 °C/ 100 % (8. 8 mm 2 ± 2. 25) groups, which presented statistically similar levels of internal misfit...|$|E

"Having {{obtained}} drawings or {{photographs of}} several persons alike in most respects, but differing in minor details, what sure method is there of extracting the typical characteristics from them? I may mention a plan which had occurred both to Mr. Herbert Spencer and myself, {{the principle of}} which is to superimpose optically the various drawings, and to accept the aggregate result. Mr. Spencer suggested to me in conversation that the drawings reduced to the same scale might be traced on separate pieces of transparent paper and secured one upon another, and then held between the eye and the light. I have attempted this with some success. My own idea was to throw faint images of the several portraits, in succession, upon the same sensitised photographic plate. I may add that it is perfectly easy to superimpose optically two portraits by means of a stereoscope, and that a person who is used to handle instruments will find a common double eyeglass fitted with <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>lenses</b> to be almost as effectual and far handier than the boxes sold in shops." ...|$|R

40|$|GAW (Gamma Air Watch) is a {{pathfinder}} {{experiment in}} the TeV range to test the feasibility {{of a new generation}} of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACT). It combines high flux sensitivity with large field-of-view (FoV= 24 deg x 24 deg) using Fresnel <b>lenses,</b> <b>stereoscopic</b> observational approach and single-photon counting mode. This particular counting mode, in comparison with the usual charge integration one, allows the triggering of events with a smaller number of collected Cherenkov photons keeping a good signal/background separation. GAW is conceived as an array of three identical imaging telescopes with 2. 13 m diameter placed at the vertices of an equilateral triangle of 80 m side.
