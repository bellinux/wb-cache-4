5|$|An ultra diffuse galaxy (UDG) is an extremely-low-density galaxy. The galaxy {{may be the}} <b>same</b> <b>size</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Milky Way but has {{a visible}} star count of only 1% of the Milky Way. The lack of {{luminosity}} is {{because there is a}} lack of star-forming gas in the galaxy which results in old stellar populations.|$|E
5|$|Scholarly {{estimates}} {{of the size of}} the 4th-century army diverge widely, ranging from ca. 400,000 to over one million effectives (i.e. from roughly the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> 2nd-century army to 2 or 3 times larger). This is due to fragmentary evidence, unlike the much better-documented 2nd-century army.|$|E
5|$|The Mark III {{telescope}} was the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Mark II, but was constructed to be transportable. However, {{it was never}} moved, and remained at its original site in Wardle, near Nantwich, where it was used as part of MERLIN. It was built in 1966, and was decommissioned in 1996.|$|E

The geared Simplex engines were turned into wind by a fantail.|$|R
5|$|The carrot is a diploid species, and {{has nine}} {{relatively}} short, uniform-length chromosomes (2n=18). The genome size {{is estimated to}} be 473 mega base pairs, which is four times larger than Arabidopsis thaliana, one-fifth the size of the maize genome, and about the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> rice genome.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} {{view of a}} {{much larger}} 4th century army has fallen out of favour with some historians in more recent times, as existing evidence has been reappraised and new evidence uncovered. The revisionist view is that the 4th-century army was, at its peak, roughly the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> 2nd-century one and considerably smaller in the late 4th century.|$|E
5|$|Estimating {{the exact}} {{rate at which}} GRBs occur is difficult; for a galaxy of {{approximately}} the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Milky Way, estimates of the expected rate (for long-duration GRBs) can range from one burst every 10,000 years, to one burst every 1,000,000 years. Only {{a small percentage of}} these would be beamed towards Earth. Estimates of rate of occurrence of short-duration GRBs are even more uncertain because of the unknown degree of collimation, but are probably comparable.|$|E

5|$|On {{the north}} side of the temple {{courtyard}} is the Manjusri Hall (文殊殿). It was constructed in 1137 during the Jin dynasty and is roughly the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> East Hall, also measuring seven bays by four. It is located on an 83cm (2.7ft) high platform, has three front doors and one central back door, and features a single-eave hip gable roof. The interior of the hall has only four support pillars. In order to support the large roof, diagonal beams are used. On each of the four walls are murals of arhats painted in 1429 during the Ming dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The {{editorial}} work was largely done by Sloane, but Gernsback retained final say over the fiction content. Two consultants, Conrad A. Brandt and Wilbur C. Whitehead, were hired {{to help find}} fiction to reprint. Frank R. Paul, {{who had worked with}} Gernsback as early as 1914, became the cover artist; Paul had produced many illustrations for the fiction in The Electrical Experimenter. Amazing was issued in the large bedsheet format, 8.5 × 11.75 in (216 × 298mm), the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> technical magazines. It was an immediate success and by the following March reached a circulation of 150,000.|$|E
5|$|The unique deep-sky object {{known as}} Hanny's Voorwerp was {{discovered}} in Leo Minor in 2007 by Dutch school teacher Hanny van Arkel while participating as a volunteer in the Galaxy Zoo project. Lying near the 650-million-light-year-distant spiral galaxy IC2497, it is around the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Milky Way. It contains a 16,000-light-year-wide hole.

50|$|In 1967, Davidoff was {{approached}} by Cubatabaco, Cuba's state tobacco monopoly after the Revolution, about creating a personal brand of cigars for his stores. The cigars were rolled in the newly established El Laguito factory in Havana, which had been established to roll Cuban President Fidel Castro's own private cigars, Cohíba. In 1968, the first productions of Davidoff cigars were released, which included the No. 1, the No. 2, and Ambassadrice (which all shared <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> early Cohiba line) and the Châteaux Series (now no longer under the Hoyo de Monterrey label, but exclusively made for the Davidoff marque).|$|R
5|$|Fantastic Adventures was {{initially}} published in bedsheet format, the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> early sf magazines such as Amazing, perhaps {{in order to}} attract fans who were nostalgic for the larger format. It started as a bimonthly, but in January 1940 began a monthly schedule. Sales were weaker than for Amazing, however, and with the June issue the schedule reverted to bimonthly. The size was also reduced to a standard pulp format, since that was cheaper to produce. Sales did not improve, and Ziff-Davis planned to make the October issue the last one. That issue carried Robert Moore Williams' Jongor of Lost Land, and had a cover by J. Allen St. John; the combination proved to be so popular that October sales were twice the August figures. This convinced Ziff-Davis that the magazine was viable, and it was restarted in January 1941as a bimonthly at first, but switching to monthly again in May of that year.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, the British Transport Commission, {{together}} with the British Iron and Steel Federation and Sheffield Chamber of Commerce considered plans to upgrade the navigation to handle 250-tonne barges, and work started on new wharfs and warehouses at Rotherham. Control of the navigation passed on again in 1963, this time to the British Waterways Board, who submitted a proposal to the government for a £2.5million upgrade, covering the stretch from Bramwith to Rotherham. This would have involved the construction of ten new locks, each , to replace the existing 12 locks. The new main line would then have been the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Aire and Calder Navigation, {{although some of the}} bridges would have had less clearance. In 1972, a further proposal for a £2million scheme to upgrade the waterway to handle 700-tonne barges up to Mexborough, and 400-tonne barges from there to Rotherham was submitted to the Department of the Environment.|$|E
5|$|The modern koala is {{the only}} extant member of Phascolarctidae, a family that once {{included}} several genera and species. During the Oligocene and Miocene, koalas lived in rainforests and had less specialised diets. Some species, such as the Riversleigh rainforest koala (Nimiokoala greystanesi) and some species of Perikoala, were around the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> modern koala, while others, such as species of Litokoala, were one-half to two-thirds its size. Like the modern species, prehistoric koalas had well developed ear structures which suggests that long-distance vocalising and sedentism developed early. During the Miocene, the Australian continent began drying out, leading to the decline of rainforests {{and the spread of}} open Eucalyptus woodlands. The genus Phascolarctos split from Litokoala in the late Miocene and had several adaptations that allowed it to live on a specialised eucalyptus diet: a shifting of the palate towards the front of the skull; larger molars and premolars; smaller pterygoid fossa; and a larger gap between the molar and the incisor teeth.|$|E

5|$|As {{with many}} other Ficus species, the {{community}} of wasps inside the figs of F. rubiginosa is made up mostly of pollinator wasps. These develop deep inside the syconium, presumably protected there from parasites. Also present are much smaller numbers of other wasp species, which do not pollinate the fig. At least fourteen species have been recorded, of which four—two each belonging to the genera Sycoscapter and Philotrypesis—are common while others are rare. Investigation of F. rubiginosa syconia found that the fig seeds and parasitic wasps develop closer {{to the wall of}} the syconium. The wasps of the genera Sycoscapter and Philotrypesis are parasitic and are around the <b>same</b> <b>size</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> pollinator species. Their larvae are thought to feed on the larvae of the pollinator wasp. Male Sycoscapter and Philotrypesis wasps fight other males of the same species when they encounter each other in a F. rubiginosa fig. Several genera of uncommon larger wasp species enter the immature figs before other wasps and induce galls, which may impact on numbers of pollinator wasps in the fig later. An example of this is Pseudidarnes minerva, a metallic green wasp species.|$|E
