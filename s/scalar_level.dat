40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} meshless Galerkin level set method for {{structural}} shape and topology optimization of continua.

Compactly supported radial basis functions (CSRBFs) are used to parameterize level set function and construct the meshless shape functions. The meshless Galerkin global weak form is employed to implement the discretization of the state equations. This provides a pathway to simplify the numerical procedures in most conventional level set by unifying the two different stages just in terms of one set of scattered nodes. The proposed level set method has the capability of describing the implicit moving boundaries without remeshing for discontinuities.

This study aims to determine how such a stiffness gradient across the calcified cartilage and bone changes with joint degeneration and how different <b>scalar</b> <b>levels</b> of testing are correlated. MethodUsing a bovine model of early osteoarthritis (OA), multiple samples of calcified cartilage on subchondral bone (SB) from sixteen bovine patellae, displaying a range of cartilage states from intact (healthy) to moderately degenerate, were tested using macroscopic three-point bending, microhardness indentation, and nanoindentation. Mechanical properties were correlated to cartilage health and microstructural morphometric measurements obtained from high resolution imaging using Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) Microscopy. ResultsThere was a significant decrease in the moduli obtained from tests done at increasing <b>scalar</b> <b>levels.</b> The macroscale average modulus obtained from three-point bending showed that the SB was 10 times stiffer than the calcified cartilage in healthy tissue, 5 times in tissue displaying mildly degenerate AC and 8 times with moderate degeneration. Microhardness testing of multiple points from the calcified cartilage to the SB revealed that there was a monotonic gradual increase in the mean modulus. The moduli obtained from nanoindentation testing indicated that the SB was about twice the stiffness of the calcified cartilage. ConclusionThe mechanical transition from calcified cartilage to SB involves a graded continuum of increasing material stiffness. This stiffness gradient is altered in association with early degenerative change in the overlying AC, detectable only at the macro level...|$|R

For the jet flow and Reynolds numbers investigated, the isoscalar-surface geometry is both scalarthreshold - and Re-dependent; the level-set (coverage) length decreases with increasing Re, indicating enhanced mixing with increasing Reynolds number; and the size distribution of closed regions is well described by lognormal statistics at small scales.

40|$|Characteristics of {{the process}} of {{entrainment}} in plane mixing layers, and the changes with compressibility and heat release, were studied using temporal DNS with simultaneous fluid packet tracking. Convective Mach numbers of the simulations are 0. 15, 0. 7 and 1. 1. The Reynolds number is quite high (between 11 000 and 37 000 based on layer width and velocity difference), and is above the mixing transition. The study agrees with recent findings in round jets: first, engulfed fluid volume and its growth rate are both very small compared with the volume of the turbulent region and its growth rate, respectively. Secondly, most often, the process occurs close to the turbulent-nonturbulent boundaries. A new finding is that both compressibility and heat release retard the entrainment process so that it takes an O(1) time for vorticity or <b>scalar</b> <b>levels</b> to grow even after growth has been initiated. This delay is manifested as the fall in mixing layer growth rates as compressibility and heat release levels increase...|$|R

The Regulatory Emotional Self-Efficacy scale (RESE) by Caprara and Gerbino (2001) measures perceived capabilities to express positive emotions (POS) and to manage negative emotions, namely, despondency/distress (DES) and anger/irritation (ANG). The present research investigated {{the validity of the}} RESE scale in Germany. Study 1 investigated the factor structure and convergent validity of the scale in a sample of university students. In order to test the generalizability of findings from Study 1, in Study 2 we studied the factor structure, cross-gender invariance, and convergent validity of a slightly revised version of the scale in a sample of parents. The previously found factor structure was successfully replicated in both samples. Partial invariance on the <b>scalar</b> <b>level</b> was confirmed across gender. All self-efficacy subscales were positively correlated with life satisfaction and with reappraisal (a cognitive emotion regulation strategy).

However, the factor structure of the SPQ has been a matter of some debate. As a contribution to this debate, we examined the factor structure of the SPQ in Malaysian adults. Method. A total of 382 Malaysian adults completed a Malay translation of the SPQ. Confirmatory factory analysis was used to examine the fit of 3 - and 4 -factor solutions for the higher-order dimensionality of the SPQ. Ethnic invariance for the best-fitting model was tested at the configural, metric, and <b>scalar</b> <b>levels,</b> and a multivariate analysis of variance was used to examine sex and ethnicity differences in domain scores. Results. The 4 -factor model provided a better fit to the data than did the 3 -factor model. The 4 -factor model also demonstrated partial measurement invariance across ethnic groups.

The 4 -factor structure of the SPQ received confirmatory support and can be used in Malay-speaking populations...|$|R
40|$|Higher {{education}} and development {{has not been}} a priority of global policy or research funding in recent decades. Yet, since the millennium, Southern governments have become believers in the global knowledge economy and higher education enrolment growth has been phenomenal. In this paper we offer an original account of how higher education institutions contribute to economic development by drawing on evolutionary economics and the national innovation systems approach. This offers distinct advantages in conceptualising higher education's developmental role, through its stress on the importance of education, skills, work, innovation and production for economic development. Using these concepts, we examine how well South African higher education is positioned to contribute to economic development through a consideration of two case studies from astronomy and automotives. These highlight the importance of the intersection between global, national, sectoral and spatial dimensions of the education - economic development relationship. We suggest that dynamics at multiple <b>scalar</b> <b>levels</b> work in complex ways to shape possibilities for development.

40|$|Abstract Automatic {{differentiation}} (AD) is {{a useful}} tool for computing Jacobians of functions needed in estimation and control algorithms. However, for many inter-esting problems in robotics, state variables live on a differentiable manifold. The most common example are robot orientations that are elements of the Lie group SO(3). This causes problems for AD algorithms that only consider differentiation at the <b>scalar</b> <b>level.</b> Jacobians produced by scalar AD are correct, but scalar-focused methods are unable to apply simplifications based on the structure of the specific manifold. In this paper we extend the theory of AD to encompass handling of differ-entiable manifolds and provide a C++ library that exploits strong typing and expres-sion templates for fast, easy-to-use Jacobian evaluation. This method has a number of benefits over scalar AD. First, it allows the exploitation of algebraic simplifica-tions that make Jacobian evaluations more efficient than their scalar counterparts. Second, strong typing reduces the likelihood of programming errors arising from misinterpretation that are possible when using simple arrays of scalars. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to consider the structure of differentiable manifolds directly in AD. ...|$|E
40|$|The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is {{a widely}} used {{screening}} instrument for child psychopathology. Many studies have consistently reported rather low alpha values for certain subscales for the SDQ parent version. Further, the factor structure has not been tested frequently by using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA); research into measurement invariance is even scarcer. Therefore, this study evaluates the internal reliability and tests for measurement invariance for the SDQ parent version. In a Dutch sample of 1, 484 children we examined reliability by using coefficient omega and tested for invariance across several subgroups. Also, we conducted CFA to examine the five-factor structure of the SDQ. omega yielded higher values than alpha did, which supports the use of omega in a SEM-based framework. Support for measurement invariance {{was found on the}} configural, metric, and <b>scalar</b> <b>level,</b> and as expected, the five-factor structure was confirmed.

30|$|We {{revisited}} {{the continuum}} dislocation dynamics (CDD) theory which describes conservative motion of dislocations {{in terms of}} series of hierarchical evolution equations of dislocation alignment tensors. Unlike theories based on the Kröner-Nye tensor which measures the excess dislocation density, in CDD, dislocations of different orientation can coexist within an elementary volume. Due to this fundamental difference, in CDD, dislocations interactions should be dealt with a different approach than in GND-based theories. We introduced models for climb and cross-slip annihilation mechanisms. The annihilation rates of alignment tensors {{for the first and}} the second order CDD theories CDD(1) and CDD(2) were calculated in Appendix 2 and 3. Later we discussed models for incorporating the activation of Frank-Read, double cross slip and glissile junction sources into CDD theory. Due to the dynamic nature of source mechanisms, ensembles of DDD simulations are needed to characterize the correlation matrices which emerge in the continuum formulation of these mechanisms. We outline the structure of the first and second order CDD theories with annihilation and sources in Appendix 4 and 5 respectively. We finally demonstrated that by including annihilation and generation mechanism in CDD theory, even zeroth-order CDD theory (CDD(0)) obtained by truncating the evolution equations at <b>scalar</b> <b>level,</b> can describe the first 3 stages of work hardening.|$|E

40|$|A multidimensional discretisation of {{the shallow}} water {{equations}} governing unsteady free-surface flow is proposed The method, based on a residual distribution discretisation, relies on a characteristic eigenvector decomposition of each cell residual, {{and the use of}} appropriate distribution schemes. For uncoupled equations, multidimensional convection schemes on compact stencils are used, while for coupled equations, either system distribution schemes such as the Lax-Wendroff scheme or scalar schemes may be used. For steady subcritical flows, the equations can be partially diagonalised into a purely convective equation of hyperbolic nature, and a set of coupled equations of elliptic nature. The multidimensional discretisation, which is second-order-accurate at steady state, is shown to be superior to the standard Lax-Wendroff discretisation. For steady supercritical flows, the equations can be fully diagonalised into a set of convective equations corresponding to the steady state characteristics. Discontinuities such as hydraulic jumps, are captured in a sharp and non-oscillatory way. For unsteady flows, the characteristic equations remain coupled. An appropriate treatment of the coupling terms allows the discretisation of these equations at the <b>scalar</b> <b>level.</b> Although presently only first-order-accurate in space and time the classical dam-break problem demonstrates the validity of the approach. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

These notions include, in increasing order of strength, the core notions of "Euclidean" extreme points, "matrix" extreme points, and "absolute" extreme points. A seemingly different notion, the "Arveson boundary", has by contrast a dilation theoretic flavor. An Arveson boundary point is an analog of a (not necessarily irreducible) boundary representation for an operator system. This article provides and explores dilation theoretic formulations for the above notions of extreme points. The scalar solution set of a linear matrix inequality (LMI) {{is known as}} a spectrahedron. The matricial solution set of an LMI is a free spectrahedron. Spectrahedra (resp. free spectrahedra) lie between general convex sets (resp. matrix convex sets) and convex polyhedra (resp. free polyhedra). As applications of our theorems on extreme points, it is shown the polar dual of a matrix convex set K is generated, as a matrix convex set, by finitely many Arveson boundary points if and only if K is a free spectrahedron; and if the polar dual of a free spectrahedron K is again a free spectrahedron, then at the <b>scalar</b> <b>level</b> K is a polyhedron.
