40|$|International audienceWe empirically analyse the {{response}} of labour market related variables in the US manufacturing sector to various shocks, notably to trade openness and technology, as well as examining spillovers from industry-specific labour market shocks. The econometric approach involves an application of the recently developed global VAR (GVAR) methodology of Dées, Di Mauro, Pesaran, and Smith (2007) to 12 manufacturing industries over the period 1977 - 2003. The framework allows us to analyse {{the response}} of a standard set of labour-market related variables (employment, real compensation, productivity and capital stock) to exogenous factors (a sector-specific measure of trade openness, a common technology and oil price shock), along with industry spillovers using specific measures of manufacturing-wide variables for each sector. Generalised impulse responses indicate that increased trade openness negatively affects real compensation, has negligible employment effects and leads to higher labour productivity. These impacts, however, are relatively weaker than those induced by technology shocks, with the latter positively and significantly affecting both real compensation and employment. There is also evidence of positive spillovers across industries from sector-specific employment and productivity shocks. Impact elasticities suggest strong intra-sectoral linkages for employment and capital <b>stock</b> <b>formation,</b> contrasting with weak linkages for what concerns real compensation and productivity...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to evaluate determinants of the general FDI flow to Visegrad countries and the effect of participation in EMU and EU. It was decided to investigate how augmented Gravity Model of trade allows identifying and evaluating the significance of pull and push factors of FDI. In an empirical analysis of panel data Hausman‐Taylor estimator was used because of the time‐invariant variables presence. While investment decisions regarding the choice of country are determined by the size of the target market, the distance is still a negative factor in creation of FDI volume. Additionally, it was proven that membership in EMU, differences in taxation, historical background, access to the sea and prices stability have significant impact of FDI <b>stock</b> <b>formation</b> in each country belonging to V 4. Is was also noted that Poland became a leader of the V 4 as well as EU‐ 12 FDI market sourcing from the old EU Member States. It is necessary to develop an “FDI attracting mechanism” using existing resources. Business regulations and taxation policy as well as main macroeconomic variables which are responsible for the economy standing are also examined as attracting the FDI flow. The originality of this work lies in studying some aspects of FDI inflow into the group of both similar and different countries in economic measures terms...|$|E
40|$|In a busy {{railway network}} {{such as the}} Netherlands, more and more {{maintenance}} activities are needed to be performed. These planned activities often lead to an infeasible timetable since infrastructure is temporary unavailable for operations. A macroscopic network model can roughly adjust the timetable for a complete network, while a microscopic model is needed to check for possessions in station areas and ensure feasibility of the timetable. In this thesis a microscopic routing model is proposed that adjusts the route plan in a station area while minimising passenger dissatisfaction. The model also finds new rolling stock connections, implements shunting movements in a station area and considers shorter rolling <b>stock</b> <b>formations.</b> To increase {{the quality of the}} route plan, its robustness is increased iteratively and small time shifts of arrivals and departures are applied to resolve small conflicts that would lead to cancellations.

40|$|Formation of {{brood stock}} is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most important operations in order to acquire eggs and fry from any promising candidate finfish species for aquaculture production. The sex reversal observed in hermaphrodite species adds to confusion and creates additional complications in forming a brood stock. The present study describes the efforts and the results of the brood <b>stock</b> <b>formation</b> of the hermaphrodite finfish species Pagellus erythrinus (common Pandora) from individuals aged between 4 and 5 years (TL> 300 mm) reared in floating cages. Six groups were formed (50 fish/group) in all of which females were present comprising 20 to 40 % of the population. The presence of females was in contrast to the literature, which reported that sex reversal of the common Pandora is complete in naturally occurring populations with the absence of females in sizes of a total length greater than 220 mm, indicating that in captivity sex reversal is not complete for this species. Four of the groups formed spawned under natural environmental conditions without hormonal treatment and the other two groups were administered a different dosage (250 and 500 IU/kg) of Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) to induce spawning. The reproductive period started in the middle of May and ended at the beginning of July and spontaneous spawning occurred in all groups. Egg release lasted for a mean period of one month for the groups that spawned without hormonal treatment with no significant difference in the number of viable eggs between groups. The groups that spawned under hormonal treatment released eggs for a period of six and seven days, for the group that spawned under the high and low hormonal treatment, respectively, with no significant difference in the number of viable eggs between them. The hormonal induced spawning resulted in egg release within a short period of time ideal for a hatchery. However, the number of viable eggs produced was significantly lower compared to the number of viable eggs produced from groups that spawned without hormonal treatment...|$|E

40|$|Motivated by {{the success}} of {{internal}} habit formation preferences in explaining asset pricing puzzles, we introduce these preferences in a life-cycle model of consumption and portfolio choice with liquidity constraints, undiversifiable labor income risk and stock-market participation costs. In contrast to the initial motivation, we find that the model is not able to simultaneously match two very important stylized facts: a low stock market participation rate, and moderate equity holdings for those households that do invest in <b>stocks.</b> Habit <b>formation</b> increases wealth accumulation because the intertemporal consumption smoothing motive is stronger. As a result, households start participating in the stock market very early in life, and invest their portfolios almost fully in stocks. Therefore, we conclude that, with respect to its ability to match the empirical evidence on asset allocation behavior, the internal habit formation model is dominated by its time-separable utility counterpart.

We explore linkages between weights on earnings in compensation contracts and in <b>stock</b> price <b>formation.</b> A distinction between the valuation and incentive contracting roles of earnings in Paul [1992] produces the null hypothesis that valuation earnings coefficients ("VEC"s) and compensation earnings coefficients ("CEC"s) are unrelated. Our empirical analyses of the relations between earnings and both stock prices and executive compensation data at the firm and industry levels over the period 1971 - 2000 rejects Paul's [1992] hypothesis of no relation. We also document an increasing weight over time on other public performance information captured by stock returns in the determination of cash compensation. Specifically, we find that the incentive coefficient on returns is significantly higher in the second of two equal sample subperiods relative to the incentive coefficient on earnings.

The characteristic periodicity shown by most buddings was not due to an inherent tendency of the plant towards interrupted elongation growth but depended on environmental conditions, the girth of the stock, and the growth vigour of the 62 clone.

This periodicity of shoot formation, and the decreasing size of successive leaves within a shoot resulting in its typical umbrella- like shape, were explained as the effect of an interaction between a fairly even moisture supply to the growing point and changing water consumption by the developing leaves...|$|R
