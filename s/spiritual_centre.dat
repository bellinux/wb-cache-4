5|$|Under the British Mandate, Haifa {{became an}} {{industrial}} port city. The Bahá'í Faith in 1918 and today has its administrative and <b>spiritual</b> <b>centre</b> in the environs of Haifa. Many Jewish immigrants of the Fourth Aliyah and Fifth Aliyah settled in Haifa. The port {{was a major}} source of income, and the nearby towns of the Krayot were established in the 1930s. At the same time, the Arab population also swelled by an influx of migrants, coming mainly from surrounding villages as well as Syrian Hauran. The Arab immigration mainly came as a result of prices and salary drop. Between the censuses of 1922 and 1931, the Muslim, Jewish, and Christian populations rose by 217%, 256%, and 156%, respectively. According to a census conducted in 1922 by the British Mandate authorities, Haifa had a population of 24,634, consisting of 9,377 Muslims, 6,230 Jews and 8,863 Christians. In 1938, 52,000 Jews and 51,000 Muslims and Christians lived in Haifa.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two sides}} to creation, one from a <b>spiritual</b> <b>centre</b> to {{plurality}}, another from plurality to the <b>spiritual</b> <b>centre.</b> Plurality is the separation of pure consciousness from the divine source.

The hidden or true nature of creation is called the bāṭenī or the esoteric.|$|E

25|$|In {{his early}} thirties, Ginzberg {{returned}} to Odessa {{where he was}} influenced by Leon Pinsker, {{a leader of the}} Hovevei Zion (Lovers of Zion) movement whose goal was settlement of Jews in Palestine. Unlike Pinsker, Ginsberg did not believe in political Zionism, which he fought, 'with a vehemence and austerity which embittered that whole period'. Instead he hailed the spiritual value of the Hebrew renaissance to counter the debilitating fragmentation (hitpardut) in the diaspora, he believed that the ingathering of Jews in Palestine was not an answer. Kibbutz galuyoth was a messianic ideal rather than a feasible contemporary project. The real answer lay in achieving a <b>spiritual</b> <b>centre,</b> or 'central domicile', within Palestine, that of Eretz Israel, which would form an exemplary model for the dispersed world of Jewry in exile to imitate; a spiritual focus for the circumferential world of the Jewish diaspora. He split from the Zionist movement after the First Zionist Congress, because he felt that Theodor Herzl's program was impractical. From 1889 to 1906, Ginzberg flourished as a preeminent intellectual in Zionist politics.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} years after his {{accession}} to the throne in 893, Simeon I successfully defended Bulgaria's commercial interests, acquired territory between the Black Sea and the Strandzha mountains, and imposed an annual tribute on the Byzantine Empire {{as a result of}} the Byzantine–Bulgarian war of 894–896. The outcome of the war confirmed Bulgarian domination in the Balkans, but SimeonI knew that he needed to consolidate his political, cultural and ideological base in order to fulfil his ultimate goal of claiming an imperial title for himself and eventually assuming the throne in Constantinople. He implemented an ambitious construction programme in Bulgaria's new capital, Preslav, so that the city would rival the splendour of the Byzantine capital. SimeonI continued the policy of his father Boris I (r.852–889) of establishing and disseminating Bulgarian culture, turning the country into the literary and <b>spiritual</b> <b>centre</b> of Slavic Europe. The Preslav and literary schools, founded under BorisI, reached their apogee during the reign of his successor. It was at this time that the Cyrillic alphabet was invented, most likely by the Bulgarian scholar Clement of Ohrid.|$|E
25|$|Beyond controversies, the Bahá'ís in New Zealand have broadened their {{interests}} both through individual initiatives and collective action. In 1991 an assembly {{was elected in}} the Kapiti Coast District. In 2000 two Bahá'í pioneers from New Zealand settled in Pitcairn Islands, {{one of the few}} nations on earth that had no Bahá'í presence. In 2006 Bahá'ís helped dedicate the temporary <b>Spiritual</b> <b>Centre</b> at Middlemore Hospital. In 2007 Dunedin Bahá'ís had been granted access to a community center. The Universal House of Justice called for a regional conference for the Bahá'ís from New Zealand, the Cook Islands, Fiji, Hawaii, Kiribati, New Caledonia and the Loyalty Islands, Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu to be held in Auckland’s Manukau City, on the sacred grounds of their marae, in 2008 and it came to pass in February 2009. The Bahá'í on Air television show is broadcast weekly on Auckland's Triangle TV which also covers the Cook Islands, American Samoa, and Adelaide, Australia. There has also been an independent documentary by a non-Bahá'í New Zealander exploring the religion in 2007. In 2011 Bahá'ís participated in the community memorial for those who had died in the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. It was mentioned in a review of spirituality in business in 2012. The community in Tauranga invited the Bahá'ís to join their interfaith council.|$|E

25|$|It is {{uncertain}} why Fergus failed {{to support his}} grandson against Somairle. The record of the capture of Domnall mac Máel Coluim at Whithorn in 1156, as recorded by the twelfththirteenth-century Chronicle of Holyrood, and Gesta Annalia I, may have bearing on Fergus. Domnall {{appears to have been}} a son of Máel Coluim mac Alasdair, who was in turn a claimant to the Scottish throne and somehow related to Somairle. Following David's death in 1153, Somairle and Máel Coluim had risen in revolt against a newly inaugurated Malcolm without much success. Domnall's later capture in western Galloway, therefore, could be evidence that the Meic Máel Coluim claimants had attempted to forcefully carve out a power base in western Galloway. However, the fact that the chronicle makes no mention of such conflict in Galloway, coupled with the fact that Whithorn was a <b>spiritual</b> <b>centre</b> rather than a secular power centre, could suggest that Domnall was in the region under less violent circumstances. If so, it is conceivable that Fergus could have originally forged an understanding with the Meic Máel Coluim before pressure from his sons forced him to desert Domnall's cause. The fact that the latter's capture preceded Somairle's coup could suggest that, although Domnall may have been in the midst of securing Gallovidian support, once Somairle's designs against Guðrøðr became apparent, the Gallovdians handed over Somairle's kinsman to the Scots.|$|E
500|$|Interpretation of {{the wording}} {{has been sought}} in the {{correspondence}} leading to {{the final version of}} the declaration. An official report to the War Cabinet sent by Sykes on 22 September said that the Zionists did not want [...] "to set up a Jewish Republic or any other form of state in Palestine or in any part of Palestine" [...] but rather preferred some form of protectorate as provided in the Palestine Mandate. A month later, Curzon produced a memorandum circulated on 26 October 1917 where he addressed two questions, the first concerning the meaning of the phrase [...] "a National Home for the Jewish race in Palestine"; he noted that there were different opinions ranging from a fully fledged state to a merely <b>spiritual</b> <b>centre</b> for the Jews.|$|E
