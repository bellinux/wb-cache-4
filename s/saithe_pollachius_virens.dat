40|$|The <b>saithe,</b> <b>Pollachius</b> <b>virens</b> (L.) is {{a marine}} fish, rep-resenting the family Gadidae. It {{naturally}} {{occurs in the}} North Atlantic Ocean {{and it has been}} rarely reported from the Baltic Sea (Froese and Pauly 2008). The hitherto con-ducted parasitic surveys of this fish focused on the Atlantic, particularly the Sea of Norway and the Barents Sea (e. g., Rokicki and Strömberg 1991, Karasev et al. 1996, Strømnes and Andersen 1998, Lom 2002). The Baltic Sea is a brackish inland body of water with salinities ranging from 3. 7 PSU (Bothnian Bay) to 8 PSU (Pomeranian Bay) (Łomniewski et al. 1975). Its animal-and plant species diversity is much lower than that of full-salinity seas. It is particularly evident in the composition of its fish fauna and invertebrate fauna. The low species diversity of potential definitive, intermediate, or paratenic hosts may also theoretically affect the species richness of fish parasites (Rhode 2002, Zander and Reimer 2002). Therefore {{it would be interesting to}} compare the parasite faunas of saithe from the Baltic Sea and Atlantic Ocean. The results of the presently reported study comprise the first published parasite records of saithe from the Baltic Sea off Polish coast. In March 2007, a single, semi-ripe female <b>saithe,</b> <b>Pollachius</b> <b>virens</b> (99 cm TL, 9. 2 kg), was caught in the Gulf of Gdańsk.

Pollock were rarely solitary in the open habitat and usually formed large schools. In the algal habitats, pollock were usually dispersed and preferred the dense algae over the sparse algae. Predation risk from birds was widely distributed among depths, habitats and stages of the tide, during the day.

Therefore, PFAAs concentrations in fish from the North Atlantic (Icelandic fishing grounds) in the flesh of different fish species were investigated along with more detailed analyses of tissue concentrations in cod (Gadus morhua) and lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus).

Its abundance-at-age shows strong seasonal variations, with a marked increase from spring to summer followed by a decline through autumn and winter. These patterns relate partly to seasonal changes in depth distribution and catchability. Combined with the observation that spawning-stage pollack are abundant in spring, we interpret these patterns to suggest that pollack in Masfjorden represent a dynamically independent unit. Seasonal changes in abundance are less marked for cod, and seasonal changes in depth distribution seem insignificant. However, cod shows an unusual pattern in length at age, with no apparent growth in summer and fast growth in autumn.

40|$|Comparing {{the current}} 2009 {{estimates}} of spawning stock biomass (SSB) and {{fishing mortality rate}} (F) to the newly accepted reference points, the pollock stock is not overfished and overfishing is not occurring. A new assessment model (ASAP) is accepted as the best scientific information available for determining stock status for pollock (<b>Pollachius</b> <b>virens).</b> SSB in 2009 {{is estimated to be}} 196, 000 mt and the average F on ages 5 - 7 (F 5 - 7) is estimated to be 0. 07 (Figure C 3 and Figure C 8). F 40 % is recommended as the new proxy for FMSY (the overfishing threshold). The average fishing mortality on ages 5 to 7 is chosen as the basis of indicator and reference point estimation in order to account for temporal changes in fishery age-specific selectivity. F 40 %, measured as F on the fully selected age (age- 7) in the most recent period (2005 – 2009) is 0. 41, which is equivalent to an average fishing mortality on ages 5 - 7 (F 5 - 7) of 0. 25. SSBMSY (the biomass target) is calculated from projections at F 40 % and is estimated to be 91, 000 mt. If the previously used AIM model had been used to determine stock status, the resource would have been judged to be overfished and overfishing to be occurring. In contrast to th...|$|R
40|$|Pollock, <b>Pollachius</b> <b>virens</b> (L.) have {{traditionally}} been assessed as a unit stock from the Scotian Shelf (NAFO Divisions 4 VWX) to Georges Bank, the Gulf of Maine and portions of the Mid-Atlantic region (Subareas 5 and 6). This stock was last assessed over its range via VPA at SAW 16 in 1993 (Mayo and Figuerido 1993, NEFSC 1993 a, 1993 b). At that time, spawning stock biomass had been declining since the mid- 1980 s, and was expected to reach its long-term average (144, 000 mt). Fishing mortality {{was estimated to be}} 0. 72 in 1992, above F 20 % (0. 65) and well above Fmed (0. 47). The stock was then considered to be fully exploited and at a medium biomass level. The state of this stock was first evaluated via index assessment in 2000 (Mayo 2001). At that time, it was noted that biomass indices for the Gulf of Maine-Georges Bank portion of the stock, derived from NEFSC autumn bottom trawl surveys, had increased during the mid- 1970 s, declined sharply during the 1980 s, but have been generally increasing since the mid- 1990 s. Indices derived from Canadian bottom trawl surveys, conducted on the Scotian Shelf, increased during the 1980 s, but declined sharply during the early 1990 s. The index assessment provided no basis with which to evaluate the state of the stock relative to the control rule as determined b...|$|R
