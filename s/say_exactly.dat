5|$|Further {{material}} was {{gleaned from the}} De honesta disciplina of 1504 by Petrus Crinitus, which included extracts from Michael Psellos's De daemonibus, and the De Mysteriis Aegyptiorum (Concerning the mysteries of Egypt…), a book on Chaldean and Assyrian magic by Iamblichus, a 4th-century Neo-Platonist. Latin versions of both had recently been published in Lyon, and extracts from both are paraphrased (in the second case almost literally) {{in his first two}} verses, the first of which is appended to this article. While it is true that Nostradamus claimed in 1555 to have burned all of the occult works in his library, no one can <b>say</b> <b>exactly</b> what books were destroyed in this fire.|$|E
25|$|Faroese {{is spoken}} {{in the entire}} area as a first language. It is {{difficult}} to <b>say</b> <b>exactly</b> how many people worldwide speak the Faroese language, because many ethnic Faroese live in Denmark, and few who are born there return to the Faroes with their parents or as adults.|$|E
25|$|A {{consequence}} of sensitivity to initial conditions {{is that if}} we start with a limited amount of information about the system (as is usually the case in practice), then beyond a certain time the system is no longer predictable. This is most familiar in the case of weather, which is generally predictable only about a week ahead. Of course, {{this does not mean that}} we cannot say anything about events far in the future; some restrictions on the system are present. With weather, we know that the temperature will not naturally reach 100°C or fall to -130°C on earth (during the current geologic era), but we can't <b>say</b> <b>exactly</b> what day will have the hottest temperature of the year.|$|E

25|$|Arsenical bronze {{was used}} by many {{societies}} and cultures across the globe. Firstly, the Iranian plateau, followed by the adjacent Mesopotamian area, together covering modern Iran, Iraq and Syria, has the earliest arsenical bronze metallurgy in the world, as previously mentioned. It was in use from the 4th millennium BC through to mid 2nd millennium, a period of nearly 2,000 years. There {{was a great deal}} of variation in arsenic content of artefacts throughout this period, making it impossible to <b>say</b> <b>exactly</b> how much was added deliberately and how much came about by accident. Societies using arsenical bronze include the Akkadians, those of Ur, and the Amorites, all based around the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and centres of the trade networks which spread arsenical bronze across the Middle East during the Bronze Age.|$|E
500|$|Deleuze's and Latour's opinions, however, are {{minority}} ones, as Whitehead has {{not been}} recognized as particularly influential within the most dominant philosophical schools. [...] It is impossible to <b>say</b> <b>exactly</b> why Whitehead's influence {{has not been}} more widespread, {{but it may be}} partly due to his metaphysical ideas seeming somewhat counter-intuitive (such as his assertion that matter is an abstraction), or his inclusion of theistic elements in his philosophy, or the perception of metaphysics itself as passé, or simply the sheer difficulty and density of his prose.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Lang is {{scheduled}} to return as Colonel Miles Quaritch, who led the humans in their conflict with the Na'vi in Avatar. Although the character died {{at the end of}} Avatar, Cameron confirmed in 2010 that Lang would return in the first three sequels, stating [...] "I'm not going to <b>say</b> <b>exactly</b> how we're bringing him back, but it's a science fiction story, after all. His character will evolve into really unexpected places across the arc of our new three-film saga". He later stated that Quaritch would act as main antagonist once again, in all four sequels.|$|E

500|$|To {{celebrate}} their new-found attitude, the town holds a [...] "Do What You Feel" [...] festival. However, the festival soon goes awry because {{those responsible for}} building the stages and maintaining the rides [...] "didn't feel like" [...] doing a thorough job, resulting in a runaway Ferris wheel and more. Arguments begin, as everybody has been encouraged to always <b>say</b> <b>exactly</b> what is on their mind, and soon a riot starts. Bart is quickly blamed for starting the whole [...] "Do As You Feel" [...] trend. The town chases after Bart, but Homer drives by in a float and saves him. The town gives up the chase despite the float's slow speed and decides {{to go to the}} old mill to get some cider. The Simpson family returns home where they {{try to figure out what}} the lesson of the episode was, before finally concluding that everyone is fine the way they are and start to watch television.|$|E
2500|$|The {{historian}} Jean-Jacques Becker {{believed that}} his research was sensationalist in nature: [...] "This is a fighter {{who wants to}} make history effective, that is to <b>say</b> <b>exactly</b> the opposite of history…." ...|$|E
2500|$|The main {{challenge}} facing propensity theories is to <b>say</b> <b>exactly</b> what propensity means. [...] (And then, of course, {{to show that}} propensity thus defined has the required properties.) [...] At present, unfortunately, none of the well-recognised accounts of propensity comes close to meeting this challenge.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, well!" [...] said Georgina, {{with her}} lovely smile, [...] "of course {{they think that}} absence would cure me of--cure me of--" [...] And she paused, with a certain natural modesty, not <b>saying</b> <b>exactly</b> of what.|$|R
50|$|Unfortunately, {{because of}} its vitriolic {{condemnation}} of most African leaders during the post-colonial era, the book has been cited by some people as a clarion call for the re-colonisation of Africa although the author <b>says</b> <b>exactly</b> the opposite in his work.|$|R
50|$|The {{death of}} her first love, Chan-hyuk, has put Soo-jung's life at a standstill. Her aunt badgers her into going {{on a blind date}} with Dal-jae, and Soo-jung is amazed that he <b>says</b> <b>exactly</b> the same words Chan-hyuk had said when he {{proposed}} to her.|$|R
2500|$|Although {{it is hard}} to <b>say</b> <b>exactly</b> what [...] "arithmetical {{property}} of n" [...] it [...] "expresses", (τ(n) is (2π)−12 times the nth Fourier coefficient in the q-expansion of the modular discriminant function) it is included among the arithmetical functions because it is multiplicative and it occurs in identities involving certain σk(n) and r'k(n) functions (because these are also coefficients in the expansion of modular forms).|$|E
2500|$|In November 2011, {{frequent}} collaborator Alain Johannes {{stated in}} regard to his studio work with the band: [...] "We had a late night with Queens of the Stone Age again. [...] Just putting in days, super top secret, but it’s going to be amazing. I’m really excited about it. [...] Once we start the process, it goes to completion. So I can’t <b>say</b> <b>exactly</b> when, but it’s a really good start." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{worrying}} risk {{must have}} been the chance of a momentary [...] "chance synchronization", with the propeller revolving for a second or two at precisely the same rate as the gun fired (or, <b>say,</b> <b>exactly</b> twice or three times as fast). This would have concentrated the spread of fire at the propeller disc for at least a few rounds, with a real risk of severing a blade of the propeller at a stroke.|$|E
50|$|Another {{influential}} philosopher, Pavel Tichý initiated Transparent Intensional Logic, {{an original}} {{theory of the}} logical analysis of natural languages - the theory {{is devoted to the}} problem of <b>saying</b> <b>exactly</b> what it is that we learn, know and can communicate when we come to understand what a sentence means.|$|R
60|$|On {{the other}} hand, the earnestness and {{solidity}} of John's character was of benefit to Walter; and his simple truthfulness, the straightforwardness of his principles, and his blunt frankness in <b>saying</b> <b>exactly</b> what he thought, influenced Walter to quite as large an extent {{as he had}} influenced John.|$|R
5000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} put people in my place, so when {{the history of this}} {{administration}} is written at least there's an authoritarian voice <b>saying</b> <b>exactly</b> what happened."

2500|$|The Gospel of Luke {{states that}} Mary {{gave birth to}} Jesus and placed him in a manger “because {{there was no place}} for them in the inn", but does not <b>say</b> <b>exactly</b> where Jesus was born. The Greek word kataluma may be {{translated}} as either “inn” or “guestroom”, and some scholars have speculated that Joseph and Mary may have sought to stay with relatives, rather than at an inn, only to find the house full, whereupon they resorted to the shelter of a room with a manger. This could be a place to keep the sheep within the Bethlehem area, called [...] "Migdal Eder" [...] ("tower of flock") as prophesied by prophet Micah in [...]|$|E
2500|$|The 1966 GM Electrovan is {{credited}} with being the first hydrogen fuel cell car ever produced. Though fuel cells have {{been around since the}} early 1800s, General Motors was the first to use a fuel cell, supplied by Union Carbide, to power the wheels of a vehicle with a budget of [...] "millions of dollars". In 2002, it was reported that GM spent about $100 million a year in research and development of fuel cell vehicle. In June 2007, Larry Burns, vice president of research and development, said he's not yet willing to <b>say</b> <b>exactly</b> when hydrogen vehicles would be mass-produced, but he said it should happen before 2020, the year many experts have predicted. He said [...] "I sure would be disappointed if we weren't there" [...] before 2020.|$|E
2500|$|Because {{the game}} was found only {{recently}} after centuries of obscurity, {{it is difficult to}} <b>say</b> <b>exactly</b> what all the rules were. [...] Several documents describing the game have been found; however, there are differences between them. [...] Many of the pieces appear in other shogi variants but their moves may be different. [...] The board, and likewise the pieces, were made much smaller, making archeological finds difficult to decipher. [...] Research into this game continues for historical and cultural reasons, but also to satisfy the curious and those who wish to play what could be the most challenging chess-like game ever made. [...] More research must be done however. [...] This article focuses on one likely set of rules that can make the game playable in modern times but is by no means canon. [...] These rules may change as more discoveries are made and secrets of the game unlocked.|$|E
50|$|The {{script for}} Hickorydickory, about a watch and clock repair {{shop in the}} Chicago suburbs where {{everyone}} comes in with a pocket watch <b>saying</b> <b>exactly</b> when they will die, was started in 2004.

6000|$|So he <b>says</b> <b>exactly</b> what Adam and Eve said {{in their}} hearts--"I will eat {{of the tree}} of {{knowledge}} of good and evil." [...] He says in his heart, too, just what Solomon the wise said, when he, too, determined to eat of {{the fruit of the}} tree of knowledge.|$|R
40|$|Personal time, {{as opposed}} to {{external}} time, has a certain {{role to play in}} the correct account of death and immortality.

2500|$|Some years later, at the Leveson Inquiry in February 2012, Dacre {{rejected}} {{the idea that he}} imposes his will on the paper. He commented that some issues contain opinions which [...] "make my hair go white" [...] and asserted that some journalists [...] "would resign if I told them what to write". He once suggested in general terms to a new employee, sports' columnist Des Kelly, the best way to write for readers: [...] "Make them laugh, make them cry, or make them angry". Peter Preston noted: [...] "He can hire leading voices from the Guardian or the Observer and let them <b>say</b> <b>exactly</b> what they'd have said in their old homes." [...] James Chapman, in an interview with GQ magazine defending Dacre, pointed to his newspaper's campaign to close down the Guantanamo Bay detention camp and opposition to Kenneth Clarke's proposal for secret courts. The astrologer Jonathan Cainer was first taken on for a Mail horoscope column in December 1992. Given to an unconventional dress code Dacre found objectionable, his contract had a clause insisting he wore a suit. Cainer, who spent the bulk of his career at the Mail although he [...] "never once agreed with an editorial they have published", was the highest paid journalist of his era.|$|E
2500|$|Not {{long after}} Abe began work at Yoshidaya, Ishida began making amorous {{advances}} towards her. Omiya had never satisfied Abe sexually, {{and she gave}} in to Ishida. In mid-April, Ishida and Abe initiated their sexual relationship in the restaurant {{to the accompaniment of}} a romantic ballad sung by one of the restaurant's geishas. On April 23, 1936 Abe and Ishida met for a pre-arranged sexual encounter at a teahouse, or machiai—the contemporary equivalent of a love hotel—in the Shibuya neighborhood. Planning only for a short 'fling', the couple instead remained in bed for four days. On the night of April 27, 1936, they moved to another teahouse in the distant neighborhood of Futako Tamagawa where they continued to drink and have sex, occasionally with the accompaniment of a geisha's singing, and would continue even as maids entered the room to serve sake. They next moved to the Ogu neighborhood, and Ishida did not actually return to his restaurant until the morning of May 8, 1936, after an absence of about two weeks. Of Ishida, Abe later said, [...] "It is hard to <b>say</b> <b>exactly</b> what was so good about Ishida. But it was impossible to say anything bad about his looks, his attitude, his skill as a lover, the way he expressed his feelings. I had never met such a sexy man." ...|$|E
2500|$|For The Veronicas, Jessica and Lisa {{wanted to}} create a [...] "progressive pop" [...] album drawing on {{inspiration}} from genres such as blues, trip hop, rock and roll, grunge, classical music, classical rock, pop and rap. Wanting to make an album which differed from their more familiar pop rock sound, Lisa said that this album would be [...] "eclectic" [...] and not [...] "predictable in any way." [...] Lisa said [...] "We go from something like “Sanctified,” which, to be honest, wasn’t written with the idea of being a Veronicas track. That was very much written when I was in Nashville and I was immersing myself in the blues and roots-y, swampy soul singing. Then we were working with Billy Corgan we did a “fuck you” kind of track “Did You Miss Me,” which we rap on, which is a completely different thing. We get poppy with “Cold,” and bring it back to an acoustic song like “You and Me” which could be considered a little bit folk-y, country" [...] " [...] Lisa said [...] "I remember we really got into trip hop and decided we were going to make a trip hop album. I then got on a bluesy-rock-swampy-soul kick after we'd spent some time in Nashville. Eventually we came back around to songs like Cruel – the stuff people identify with The Veronicas." [...] In an interview with Stephanie Anderson of BuzzFeed, the duo elaborated on the change from their first two albums, with Jessica saying: [...] "If things were one dimensional on the first and second record, like, we would <b>say</b> <b>exactly</b> how we felt, and it was all just, total passion, we really didn’t overthink it, we just put down what we were feeling, [...] is more, 3D-4D... There’s more depth and there’s more thought, and more light and shade." ...|$|E
