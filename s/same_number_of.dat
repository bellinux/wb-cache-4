On August10, NOAA released an updated prediction as well, with a 90% probability of above-to-near normal activity, but the <b>same</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> storms forecast. CSU issued another forecast on September3, indicating sixteen tropical storms, eight hurricanes, and five major hurricanes.
