50|$|Since block {{addresses}} and sizes {{are stored in}} the partition table of an MBR using 32 bits, the maximum size {{as well as the}} highest <b>start</b> <b>address</b> of a partition using drives that have 512-byte sectors (actual or emulated) cannot exceed 2 TiB−512 bytes (2,199,023,255,040 bytes or 4,294,967,295 (232−1) sectors × 512 (29) bytes per sector).

50|$|When {{setting up}} data {{structures}} like lists, queues and trees, {{it is necessary}} to have pointers to help manage how the structure is implemented and controlled. Typical examples of pointers are start pointers, end pointers, and stack pointers. These pointers can either be absolute (the actual physical address or a virtual address in virtual memory) or relative (an offset from an absolute <b>start</b> <b>address</b> ("base") that typically uses fewer bits than a full address, but will usually require one additional arithmetic operation to resolve).|$|E
50|$|The 6845 {{reads the}} <b>start</b> <b>address</b> for its display once per frame. However, if the {{internal}} timing values on the chip are altered at the correct time {{it can be}} made to prepare for a new frame without ending the current one - creating a non-continuous break in generated addresses midway through the display. This is commonly used by demos and much more rarely games to provide one moving area of the display (usually the play field) and one static (usually a status display).|$|E
5000|$|Memory {{space was}} too {{precious}} for storing textual error messages, so FOCAL used a clever work-around: error messages instead displayed the <b>start</b> <b>address</b> of the error-managing routine as a floating-point number. For example, in the FOCAL-69 implementation the division by zero error was managed by code starting at memory address octal 4333; division by zero at a program line numbered [...] produced the error message , where [...] represents memory page 28 plus an offset of 73 words. Most FOCAL sites had an [...] "error number to error message" [...] listing taped {{up near the}} terminals.|$|E
50|$|The system BIOS ROMs {{must be at}} {{the upper}} end of the address space because the CPU <b>starting</b> <b>address</b> is fixed by the design of the processor. The <b>starting</b> <b>address</b> is loaded into the program counter of the CPU after a {{hardware}} reset and must have a defined value that endures after power is interrupted to the system. On reset or power up, the CPU loads the address from the system ROM and then jumps to a defined ROM location to begin executing the system power-on self-test, and eventually load an operating system.|$|R
50|$|Before the {{implementation}} of CIDR, IPv4 networks were represented by the <b>starting</b> <b>address</b> and the subnet mask, both written in dot-decimal notation. Thus, 192.168.100.0/24 was often written as 192.168.100.0/255.255.255.0.|$|R

50|$|If {{the system}} call cannot {{complete}} before the access, {{then it must}} be restartable. This means that the context is backed {{up to the point}} of entry to the system call, while the call arguments are updated to reflect whatever portion of the operation has already been completed. For an I/O operation, this means that the buffer <b>start</b> <b>address</b> must be advanced over the data already transferred, while the length of data to be transferred must be decremented accordingly. After the Process B interaction is complete, Process A can resume execution, and the system call resumes from where it left off.|$|E

That was always the dyadic Set Word Mark (it was the only instruction not requiring a following word mark) to set word marks for the two following instructions. Execution of instructions in the card deck continued, loading the program into memory, setting word marks, and then branching to the program's <b>start</b> <b>address.</b>|$|E

5000|$|From a {{software}} perspective, the PCjr video hardware is an upward-compatible {{extension of the}} CGA, but differences in the hardware that affect mode and color selection make it incompatible from a strict hardware perspective. In general, the PCjr video hardware can do anything that a CGA can, but the design of hardware-control registers and the programming rules and techniques are different. The functions of the CGA Mode Register and Color Select Register are implemented in the VGA using different registers. The Status Register has been also moved into the VGA and has significant differences. Programs written for the CGA (using any mode or modes) work correctly and produce equivalent displays on the PCjr if they set modes only through the BIOS and control the image either through the BIOS or by directly accessing the display buffer (based at address 0xB8000) without attempting to write to or read from any video hardware registers, except certain registers of the 6845 CRTC. Those are the cursor-related registers, the light pen registers, and the <b>start</b> <b>address</b> registers. Alteration of other CRTC registers cannot be assumed to produce the same results from the PCjr video system as from the CGA (and might damage the monitor). (Programs for the CGA that manipulate the CRTC <b>start</b> <b>address</b> and that rely on address wrap-around above address 0xBC000 may not work correctly on the PCjr, because it always has a 32 KB contiguous block of RAM in the video area from address 0xB8000 through 0xBFFFF.) ...|$|E
50|$|The Texas Instruments TMS6100 is a 1 or 4-bit serial mask(factory)-programmed {{read-only}} memory IC. It is a companion chip to the TMS5100, CD2802, TMS5110, (rarely) TMS5200, and (rarely) TMS5220 speech synthesizer ICs, and was mask-programmed with LPC data {{required for a}} specific product. It holds 128Kib (16KiB) of data, and is mask-programmed with a <b>start</b> <b>address</b> for said data on a 16KiB boundary. It is also mask-programmable whether the /CE line needs to be high or low to activate, and also what the two (or four) 'internal' CE bits need to be set to activate, effectively making the total addressable area 18 bits. Finally, it is mask-programmable whether the bits are read out 1-bit serially or 4 at a time.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the limits}} of CHS addressing, a {{transition}} was made to using LBA or logical block addressing. Both the partition length and partition <b>start</b> <b>address</b> are sector values stored in the partition table entries as 32-bit quantities. The sector size used to be considered fixed at 512 (29) bytes, and a broad range of important components including chipsets, boot sectors, operating systems, database engines, partitioning tools, backup and file system utilities and other software had this value hard-coded. Since the end of 2009, disk drives employing 4,096-byte sectors (4Kn or Advanced Format) have been available, although the size of the sector for some of these drives was still reported as 512 bytes to the host system through conversion in the hard drive firmware and referred to as 512 emulation drives (512e).|$|E
50|$|Dimmer packs or racks use a {{group of}} slots to {{determine}} the levels for their dimmers. Typically a dimmer has a <b>starting</b> <b>address</b> that represents the lowest numbered dimmer in that pack, and the addressing increases {{from there to the}} highest numbered dimmer. As an example, for two packs of six dimmers each, the first pack would <b>start</b> at <b>address</b> 1 and the second pack at address 7. Each slot in the DMX512 packet corresponds to one dimmer.|$|R
5000|$|Many Unicode control {{characters}} {{are used to}} control the interpretation or display of text, but these characters themselves have no visual or spatial representation. For example, the null character (...) is used in C-programming application environments to indicate {{the end of a}} string of characters. In this way, these programs only require a single <b>starting</b> memory <b>address</b> for a string (as opposed to a <b>starting</b> <b>address</b> and a length), since the string ends once the program reads the null character.|$|R
