5|$|Marine mammals {{are widely}} {{distributed}} throughout the globe, but their distribution is patchy and coincides with the productivity of the oceans. <b>Species</b> <b>richness</b> peaks at around 40° latitude, both north and south. This corresponds to {{the highest levels of}} primary production around North and South America, Africa, Asia and Australia. Total species range is highly variable for marine mammal species. On average most marine mammals have ranges which are equivalent or smaller than one-fifth of the Indian Ocean. The variation observed in range size {{is a result of the}} different ecological requirements of each species and their ability to cope with a broad range of environmental conditions. The high degree of overlap between marine mammal <b>species</b> <b>richness</b> and areas of human impact on the environment is of concern.|$|E
5|$|Rasmussen's {{recent work}} has {{concentrated}} on further large-scale collaborations {{with the same}} group of institutions studying global patterns in biodiversity. A survey of <b>species</b> <b>richness</b> and geographical range size did not show the decrease in range size from temperate regions to the tropics that had been previously assumed; although that pattern was largely true in the northern hemisphere, it did not appear to apply in the southern hemisphere. Research evaluating the relationship between extinction and human impact showed that, after controlling for <b>species</b> <b>richness,</b> the best predictors of the global pattern of extinction risk are measures of human impact, with ecological factors being of secondary importance. An examination of the distribution of rare and threatened vertebrate species, showed differing patterns for bird, mammal and amphibian species, which has consequences for hotspot-based conservation strategies.|$|E

He is known also for his {{pioneering}} work on island biogeography, which relates <b>species</b> <b>richness</b> to island size, an important consideration in nature conservation. Wilson however favours group selection over the Neo-Darwinian kin selection as an explanation of co-operation in social animals.|$|E

A recent study inferred that pollinator <b>species</b> <b>richnesses</b> are decreasing more slowly {{in recent decades}} in several taxa and European countries.

30|$|The study {{demonstrated}} that <b>species</b> diversity, <b>richness,</b> and evenness were low near the piospheres due to heavy grazing. Similarly, the lowest <b>species</b> diversity, <b>richness,</b> and evenness were recorded near the trough {{compared to the}} dam and the river. This study therefore recommends that range reseeding and rest period be done to rehabilitate degraded areas and facilitate plant regeneration.

5|$|Bats play an {{important}} role in forest and cave ecology in Puerto Rico and help control mosquito populations. Most species (10 of 13) are cave-dwellers with low reproductive rates; the area with the highest <b>species</b> <b>richness</b> is the Caribbean National Forest, where eleven species occur. The red fig-eating bat (red fruit bat), endemic to the Puerto Rican Bank, plays {{an important}} role in the ecology of tabonuco forest in the Luquillo Mountains since it is believed to be the only seed disperser of bulletwood (Manilkara bidentata). Cave ecosystems are enhanced by bat feces (guano) since many of the invertebrate cave fauna are either guano scavengers, detritivores or predators of the former two.|$|E

40|$|Aim To {{determine}} the factors influencing {{the distribution of}} birds in remnants in a fragmented agricultural landscape. Location Forty-seven eucalypt remnants and six sites in continuous forest in the sub-humid Midlands region of Tasmania, Australia. Methods Sites were censused over a two-year period, and environmental data were collected for remnants. The avifauna of the sites was classified and ordinated. The abundances of bird species, and bird <b>species</b> composition, <b>richness,</b> abundance and diversity were related to environmental variables, using simple correlation and model-ling. Results There were two distinct groups of sample sites, which sharply differed in <b>species</b> composition, <b>richness,</b> diversity and bird abundance, separated on the pres-ence/absence of noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala Latham) colonies, remnant size, vegetation structural attributes and variables that reflected disturbance history.

40|$|Using macrofaunal data {{collected}} at five transects in Shenzhen Bay intertidal zone between 1995 and 2010, we analyzed density, species diversity index (H'), richness index (d) and multivariate marine biotic index (M-AMBI). We found spatial differences in macrofaunal species number, <b>species</b> diversity, <b>richness</b> index and M-AMBI. Namely, the closer to Shenzhen River a sampling transect was located, {{the lower the}} macrofaunal species number, <b>species</b> diversity, <b>richness</b> index and multivariate marine biotic index. The most obvious spatial {{difference in terms of}} macrofaunal community structure was that densities of the larger-bodied species Dendronereis pinnaticirris and Neanthes glandicincta were low, while the densities of smaller and short-lived species including Capitella capitata and oligochaete animal were high at transect close to Shenzhen River. Abundance biomass comparison (ABC method) validated the spatial difference. Decreasing distance to the Shenzhen River was also related to increased levels of organic matter. We surmisethat the spatial differences we observed were related to industrial, aquacultural and municipal wastes entering the Shenzhen River associated with increasing regional population and development during the study period. Yearly and seasonal variations of macrofaunal species number, density, <b>species</b> diversity index, <b>richness</b> index and multivariate marine biotic index were inconsistent, and we found no obvious trends...|$|R
5|$|Disturbance is {{important}} in the creation of biodiverse habitats. In the absence of disturbance, a climax vegetation cover develops that prevents the establishment of other species. Wildflower meadows are sometimes created by conservationists but most of the flowering plants used are either annuals or biennials and disappear after a few years in the absence of patches of bare ground on which their seedlings can grow. Lightning strikes and toppled trees in tropical forests allow <b>species</b> <b>richness</b> to be maintained as pioneering species move in to fill the gaps created. Similarly coastal habitats can become dominated by kelp until the seabed is disturbed by a storm and the algae swept away, or shifting sediment exposes new areas for colonisation. Another cause of disturbance is when an area may be overwhelmed by an invasive introduced species which is not kept under control by natural enemies in its new habitat.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Rasmussen {{was part}} of a large multi-institutional {{collaboration}} investigating biodiversity hotspots, which have a prominent role in conservation. The study assessed locations quantitatively for three criteria of bird diversity – <b>species</b> <b>richness,</b> the level of threat, and the number of endemism species. The results demonstrated that hotspots did not show the same geographical distribution for each factor. Only 2.5% of hotspot areas are common to all three aspects of diversity, with over 80% of hotspots registering on only one criterion. Each criterion explained less than 24% of the variation in the other factors, suggesting that even within a single taxonomic class, different mechanisms are responsible for the origin and maintenance of various aspects of diversity. Consequently, the different types of hotspots also vary greatly in their utility as conservation tools.|$|E
5|$|Reef {{environments in}} Biscayne National Park have seen declines in <b>species</b> <b>richness</b> and {{diversity}} across all fish species from 1977 to 1981 to 2006–2007. A sampling program showed declines at all sampling sites. A correlation has been posited between the observed decline in coral reef coverage throughout the Florida Reef tract {{and the decline}} in fish species. Declines in populations were noted in both gamefish and in fish species not exposed to fishing pressure. Algal cover has increased as coral has declined, so that coral-dwelling species have decreased while herbivorous fish have increased. Increased overall salinity and changing salinity gradients in Biscayne Bay may also play a role, while polychlorinated biphenyl and mercury contamination have been noted in fish samples.|$|E
40|$|Identifying {{the factors}} {{controlling}} local community structure {{is a central}} problem in ecology. Ecologists frequently use regression to test fur a nonlinear saturating relationship between local community <b>richness</b> and regional <b>species</b> pool <b>richness,</b> suggesting that <b>species</b> interactions {{limit the number of}} locally coexisting species. However, communities in different regions are not independent if regions share species. We present a Monte Carlo test for whether an observed local-regional richness relationship is significantly different from that expected when regions are nonindependent and species interactions do not limit community membership. We illustrate this test with data from experimental microcosm communities. A conventional F-test suggests a significant saturating relationship between realized community <b>richness</b> and <b>species</b> pool <b>richness.</b> However, the Monte Carlo test fails to reject the null hypothesis that species interactions do not affect community <b>richness.</b> Strong <b>species</b> interactions do not necessarily set an absolute upper limit to the number of locally coexisting species...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Bats are key {{components}} of ecological networks, and studies in degraded areas are especially {{important to understand the}} impact of the human settlements on bats communities. Here, we surveyed the bat fauna in Guaribas Biological Reserve, a protected area in the Atlantic Forest in Paraiba state, northeastern Brazil, and compared it with the bat fauna that occupies the nearby villages. In the villages, we recorded 650 individuals from 14 species, while 1, 127 individuals from 20 species were recorded in the Reserve. Diversity estimation pointed out 19 species for the settlements, and 22 for the Reserve. A Bray-Curtis/Sorensen similarity cluster analysis informed that the Reserve areas and the villages form two distinct groups. Additionally, a Wilcox test pointed out that both areas have significantly distinct abundances and <b>species</b> <b>richnesses.</b> Only a subset of the assemblage, mainly formed by generalist or opportunist species, occupies the villages, exploring resources that are offered by human activities...|$|R
40|$|In the {{framework}} of the European project BIOBIO, we compared between countries habitat and cumulated <b>species</b> <b>richnesses</b> of plants, wild bees, spiders and earthworms, measured in 169 conventional and organic farms belonging to 10 case studies in 10 European countries. For the French case study (Gascony Valleys and Hills), correlations between direct (habitat and taxonomic richnesses) and indirect (agricultural practices) indicators of biodiversity within 8 conventional and 8 organic farms, were calculated. Results showed that the main driver of biodiversity at the farm level was the number of cultivated and above all semi-natural habitats, in the French case study region {{as well as in the}} other regions. This factor partially explained the highest biodiversity level of the French case study region. However, farming practices, specific or not to the organic and conventional systems, most often drove biodiversity parameters at the habitat level. In fine, the project proposed the BIOBIO method for monitoring biodiversity in farms. Peer reviewe...|$|R
5|$|The Diversity {{indices of}} the plant species were recorded; they were a {{richness}} of 48, diversity of 0.29 and evenness of 0.47 in summer. In winter, the respective figures were 81, 0.17 and 0.52. <b>Species</b> <b>richness</b> {{was found to be}} different in 48 samples of thin phumdis, 53 samples of thick phumdis and 14 samples on hard ground. The eight plant communities identified during winter and summer were Capillipedium, Leersia hexandra, Oenanthe javanica, Phragmites karka, Kyllinga triceps, Pteridium aquilinum, Zizania latifolia and Persicaria perfoliata. Zizania latifolia recorded the highest productivity with (13.90±5.01)g/m2 for winter and (102.96±26.03)g/m2 for summer. Greater productivity was recorded in summer (65.96g/m2) than winter (15.76g/m2). Variation of productivity of annuals and perennials were noted according to seasons and type of phumdis.|$|E
5|$|The {{small and}} {{isolated}} {{nature of the}} site makes it susceptible to damage from the surrounding area. For example, herbicides, thought to be generally damaging for the <b>species</b> <b>richness,</b> could get onto the site from the drift of spray from surrounding fields. To help combat this the maintenance of mature hedgerows around the perimeter is encouraged. As of 2006 the condition of Whitton Bridge Pasture is described as favourable, {{which means that the}} land is being adequately conserved and any conservation objectives are being met, but that there is scope for enhancement of the site. The condition of the site was also described as favourable in 2004 and 2005 assessments. In the future it is hoped that the grazing regime will become more regularised and will be of high priority.|$|E
5|$|The {{species has}} been found growing in small groups in the Guineo-Congolian rainforest. This forest is {{dominated}} by the single canopy tree species Gilbertiodendron dewevrei. Not only does this tree provide food in the form of edible seeds {{for a wide variety of}} large mammals, it forms mycorrhizal relationships with P.bembae. This is a mutually beneficial relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around the roots of the plant, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and affording the tree greater access to soil nutrients. The ectomycorrhizal symbiosis is thought to contribute to the success of the dominant species, by allowing it access to nutrients otherwise unavailable. The Congolian forests encompass an ecoregion known for its <b>species</b> <b>richness</b> and endemism, which is spread across four countries: Cameroon, Gabon, Republic of Congo, and the Central African Republic.|$|E

40|$|The {{impacts of}} climate change on {{ecological}} systems can only be fully understood when studied {{over a number of}} scales. Here we examine the effects of subtle shifts in the geographical range of a southerly distributed kelp, Laminaria ochroleuca and the resulting species replacement by comparing epibiont assemblages of the holdfast of this kelp species with that of a northerly distributed kelp, Laminaria digitata, over two spatial (within site and between sites) and temporal (within year and between years) scales. Univariate analysis showed that <b>species</b> <b>richness’s</b> associated with the holdfasts of L. ochroleuca were significantly lower than those of L. digitata in 2004 however, no such trend was observed in 2012. Furthermore, multivariate analysis showed that the epibiont assemblage structure of each species holdfasts was significantly different between years with a larger multivariate variation identified in 2004 compared with 2012. Multivariate analysis also identified significant differences epibiont assemblage structure of each species holdfasts over differing spatial scales.

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} spatial and {{temporal}} variations of the distribution and diversity pattern of coral reef associated gastropods assemblages in Gulf of Mannar Island and to clarify the relationship between gastropods and surrounding coral reef ecosystem. Methods: Gastropods were collected from three islands–Hare (Picnic spot), Vaan (Church Island) and Koswari (Karsuvar Island). The samples were taxonomically identified according to external structure of typical shells and classified according to their feeding habits. Statistical tool Primer (Ver. 6. 1. 11) was employed to find the <b>species</b> diversity, <b>richness</b> and evenness. Results: A total of forty species of gastropods from 19 families were identified. The gastropods population density varied differently at stations, 479 species from Vaan islands, 390 species from Koswari islands and 254 species from Hare island were recorded. The gastropods <b>species</b> diversity, <b>richness</b> and evenness indices also varied differently at stations. The highest species diversity indice was recorded at Vaan Island (2. 968), while both the highest richness and evenness indices were recorded at Hare Island with 0. 937 and 0. 942 respectively. Conclusions: The results of present study provides useful informtation for biodiversity conservation {{as well as the}} management of coral reef habitat in India. ...|$|R
40|$|Radiations {{of large}} clades often {{accompany}} rapid morphological diversification. Evolutionary biologists debate {{the impact of}} external restrictions imposed by ecology, and intrinsic constraints imposed by development and genetics, on {{the rate at which}} morphological innovations are gained. These issues are particularly interesting for groups such as tetrapods, which evolved novel body plans relative to their piscine ancestors and which also invaded new ecosystems following terrestrialization. Prior studies have addressed these issues by looking at either ranges of morphological variation or rates of character change. Here, we address a related but distinct issue: the numbers of characters that freely vary within a clade. We modify techniques similar to those used by ecologists to infer <b>species</b> <b>richnesses</b> to estimate the number of potentially varying characters given the distributions of changes implied by a model phylogeny. Our results suggest both increasing constraints/restrictions and episodes of ‘character release’ (i. e. increasing the number of potentially varying characters). In particular, we show that stem lissamphibians had a restricted character space relative to that of stem amniotes, and that stem amniotes both had restrictions on some parts of character space but also invaded new character space that had been unavailable to stem tetrapods...|$|R

The smallest twig diameter of burnt skeletons was used as a severity index and compared between two fire events for 9 permanently marked plots on the southern Cape Peninsula. <b>Species</b> diversity, <b>richness</b> and composition were analysed for one year and eight years after a fire event in 2000 and 3 years after a fire event in 2008. Twig diameters for Erica, Leucadendron, Rhus and Acacia species were significantly greater for the 2008 fire than the 2000 fire event, indicating that the fire was more severe in 2008. The ratio of reseeders to resprouters changed from 8 : 2 in 2001 and 2008 to 7 : 3 in 2011 post the second fire event. Thus resprouters were not negatively affected by increased fire severity. Ericoid reseeders appeared to favour more intense fires. Succession of fynbos communities had a greater influence on <b>species</b> diversity, <b>richness</b> and composition than fire severity.
