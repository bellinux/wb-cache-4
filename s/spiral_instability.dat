40|$|We {{study the}} {{development}} and saturation of the m= 1 one-armed <b>spiral</b> <b>instability</b> in remnants of binary neutron star mergers by means of high-resolution long-term numerical relativity simulations. Our results suggest that this instability is a generic outcome of neutron star mergers in astrophysically relevant configurations, including both “stiff” and “soft” nuclear equations of state. We find that, once seeded at merger, the m= 1 mode saturates within ∼ 10 [*][*]ms and persists over secular time scales. Gravitational waves emitted by the m= 1 instability have a peak frequency around 1 – 2 kHz and, if detected, they {{could be used to}} constrain the equation of state of neutron stars. We construct hybrid waveforms spanning the entire Advanced LIGO band by combining our high-resolution numerical data with state-of-the-art effective-one-body waveforms including tidal effects. We use the complete hybrid waveforms to study the detectability of the one-armed <b>spiral</b> <b>instability</b> for both Advanced LIGO and the Einstein Telescope. We conclude that the one-armed <b>spiral</b> <b>instability</b> is not an efficient gravitational wave emitter.

Currently {{it is not possible}} to unambiguously differentiate the large number of proposed models to explain these phenomena through existing observations. Aims. We investigate the observable predictions of a simple model that generates flux modulation: a <b>spiral</b> <b>instability</b> rotating in a thin accretion disk. This model is motivated by the accretion ejection instability (AEI) model for low- frequency QPOs (LFQPOs). We are particularly interested in the inclination dependence of the observables that are associated with this model. Methods. We develop a simple analytical model of an accretion disk, which features a <b>spiral</b> <b>instability.</b> The disk is assumed to emit blackbody radiation, which is ray-traced to a distant observer. We compute pulse profiles and power spectra as observed from infinity. Results. We show that the amplitude of the modulation associated with the spiral rotation is a strong function of inclination and frequency. The pulse profile is quasi-sinusoidal only at low inclination (face-on source). As a consequence, a higher-inclination geometry leads to a stronger and more diverse harmonic signature in the power spectrum. Conclusions. We present how the amplitude depends on the inclination when the flux modulation comes from a spiral in the disk. We also include new observables that could potentially differentiate between models, such as the pulse profile and the harmonic content of the power spectra of high-inclination sources that exhibit LFQPOs. These might be important observables to explore with existing and new instruments...|$|E

The instability quickly saturates on a timescale of ∼ 10 ms, with the m= 1 azimuthal density multipole mode dominating over higher modes. The instability also leaves a characteristic imprint on the post-merger gravitational wave signal that could be detectable if the instability persists in long-lived remnants.

40|$|A {{one-armed}} <b>spiral</b> <b>instability</b> {{has been}} found to develop in differentially rotating stellar models that have a relatively stiff, n = 1 polytropic equation of state and a wide range of rotational energies. This suggests that such instabilities can arise in neutron stars that are differentially, although not necessarily rapidly, rotating. The instability seems to be directly triggered by the presence of a corotation resonance inside the star. Our analysis also suggests that a resonant cavity resulting from a local minimum in the radial vortensity profile of the star {{plays an important role in}} amplifying the unstable mode. Hence, it appears as through this instability is closely related to the so-called “Rossby wave instability” (Lovelace et al. 1999) that {{has been found}} to arise in accretion disks. In addition to the one-armed (m = 1) spiral mode, we have found that higher-order (m = 2 and m = 3) nonaxisymmetric modes also can become unstable if corotation points that resonate with the eigenfrequencies of these higher-order modes also appear inside the star. The growth rate of each mode seems to depend on the location of its corotation radius with respect to the vortensity profile (or on the depth of its corotation radius inside the vortensity well). The existence of such instabilities makes the stability criterion for differentially rotating neutron stars non-unique. Also, the gravitational-waves emitted from such unstable systems generally will not have a monochromatic frequency spectrum.

In this thesis, I discuss {{the stability of}} such systems and explore the consequence of instability on planetary migration. I present semi-analytical models to understand {{the formation of the}} unstable structure induced by a Saturn mass planet, which leads to vortex formation. I then investigate the effect of such vortices on the migration of a Saturnmass planet using hydrodynamic simulations. I explain the resulting nonmonotonic behaviour in the framework of type III planetary migration. I then examine the role of disc self-gravity on the vortex instabilities. It can be shown that self-gravity has a stabilising effect. Linear numerical calculations confirms this. When applied to disc-planet systems, modes with small azimuthal wavelengths are preferred with increasing disc selfgravity. This is in agreement the observation that more vortices develop in simulations with increasing disc mass. Vortices in more massive discs also resist merging. I show that this is because inclusion of self-gravity sets a minimal vortex separation preventing their coalescence, which would readily occur without self-gravity. I show that in sufficiently massive discs vortex modes are suppressed. Instead, global <b>spiral</b> <b>instabilities</b> develop. They are interpreted as disturbances associated with the planet-induced structure, which interacts with the wider disc leading to instability.

40|$|Protoplanetary discs {{may become}} {{dynamically}} unstable due to structure induced by an embedded giant planet. In this thesis, I discuss {{the stability of}} such systems and explore the consequence of instability on planetary migration. I begin with non-self-gravitating, low viscosity discs and show that giant planets induce shocks inside its co-orbital region, leading to a profile unstable to vortex formation around a potential vorticity minimum. This instability {{is commonly known as}} the vortex or Rossby wave instability. Vortex-planet interaction lead to episodic phases of migration, which can be understood in the framework of type III migration. I then examine the effect of disc self-gravity on gap stability. The linear theory of the Rossby wave instability is extended to include disc gravity, which shows that self-gravity is effective at stabilising the vortex instability at small azimuthal wavenumber. This is consistent with the observation that more vortices develop with increasing disc mass in hydrodynamic simulations. Vortices in self-gravitating discs also resist merging, and is most simply understood as pair-vortices undergoing mutual horsehoe turns upon encounter. I show that in sufficiently massive discs vortex modes are suppressed. Instead, global <b>spiral</b> <b>instabilities</b> develop which are associated with a potential vorticity maximum at the gap edge. These edge modes can be physically understood as a result of unstable interaction between the gap edge and the exterior disc through gravity. I show the spiral arms can provide a positive torque on the planet, leading to fast migration outwards. I confirm the above results, obtained from razor-thin disc models, persist in three-dimensions.
