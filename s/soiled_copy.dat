60|$|On {{reaching}} the library {{he found that}} it was just after five o'clock, and that the tea had been already brought up. On a little table of dark perfumed wood thickly encrusted with nacre, a present from Lady Radley, his guardian's wife, a pretty professional invalid, who had spent the preceding winter in Cairo, was lying a note from Lord Henry, and beside it was a book bound in yellow paper, the cover slightly torn and the edges <b>soiled.</b> A <b>copy</b> of the third edition of The St. James's Gazette had been placed on the tea-tray. It was evident that Victor had returned. He wondered if he had met the men in the hall as they were leaving the house, and had wormed out of them what they had been doing. He would be sure to miss the picture--had no doubt missed it already, while he had been laying the tea-things. The screen had not been set back, and a blank space was visible on the wall. Perhaps some night he might find him creeping upstairs and trying to force the door of the room. It was a horrible thing to have a spy in one's house. He had heard of rich men who had been blackmailed all their lives by some servant who had read a letter, or overheard a conversation, or picked up a card with an address, or found beneath a pillow a withered flower or a shred of crumpled lace.|$|R
60|$|Bunyan {{published}} this Book {{in a very}} small 8vo of 294 pages. It was never reprinted separately from his other works, and even in them it suffered from serious omissions and errors. It is now accurately printed from his original edition. The copy in Dr. Williams' Library, Redcross Street, is remarkably fine and clean, a present, most probably, in the first instance, from the author, having an inscription on the fly leaf, apparently in Bunyan's autograph, 'This for my good and dearly beloved frend mistris Backcraft.' It has a false title, bearing the imprint of 'London, Printed for Francis Smith, at the Elephant and Castle without Temple Barr, 1669.' The editor's <b>copy,</b> <b>soiled</b> and tattered, cost him twenty shillings, a striking proof of its rarity. This has the original title, with the real date, 1665, but without a printer's or publisher's name-from which it may be inferred that no one dared to patronize the labours of the poor prisoner-a circumstance tending to make the book more prized by the lovers of Christian liberty. The four dedications are singular, and truly Bunyanish.|$|R
6000|$|In a {{few seconds}} Edie {{returned}} in triumph with an old <b>soiled</b> and torn <b>copy</b> of the 'Morning Intelligence,' duly procured by the ingenious Mrs. Halliss from the dairy opposite. It was a decidedly antiquated copy, and it had only too obviously been employed by its late possessor to wrap {{up a couple of}} kippered herrings; but it was still entire, so far as regarded the leaders at least, and it was perfectly legible in spite of its ancient and fish-like smell. To ensure accuracy, Ernest and Edie took a leader apiece, and carefully counted up the number of words that went to the column. They came on an average to fifteen hundred. Then Ernest counted his own manuscript with equal care--no easy task when one took into consideration the interlined or erased passages--and, to his infinite disgust, discovered that it only extended to seven hundred and fifty words. 'Why, Edie,' he said, in a very disappointed tone, 'how little it prints into! I should certainly have thought I'd written at least a whole column. And the worst of it is, I believe I've really said all I have to say about the subject.' ...|$|R

40|$|A video, {{specially}} commissioned {{and made}} by Papua New Guinea's Department of Agriculture was launched at a workshop of The Asian Soil Conservation Network (ASOCON) (see Spore page 16) {{conference on the}} subject of soil conservation practices. The video, entitled 'Lukautim Graun Bilong Yu' (Take Care of your Soil), is a 22 minute documentary that looks at how smallholders in Papua New Guinea look after their soil in everyday farming. Eighty {{percent of the population of}} Papua New Guinea still live on the land, therefore the land and the living to be obtained from it is their way of life culturally as well as economically. To be able to encapsulate all the facets of this situation required great skill, but the presence of a local agronomist and agroforestry expert as presenter for the video, which shows him working with the farmers clearing the bush, chopping trees, building retaining fences, digging ditches and making compost mounds, Brings reality as we as vitality to the production. The video has a real flavour of Papua New Guinea. It shows how smallholders conserve the soil with their traditional methods, why these measures are necessary and the threats to these traditional systems. As everywhere else, there needs to be greater awareness for the need to implement soil conservation even for 'model' farmers. The video is therefore being shown throughout the ASOCON region and is to be used in PNG's <b>soil</b> conservation programme. <b>Copies</b> of 'Lukautim Graun Bilong Yu' are available on VHS PAL, price US$ 50 plus postage (payable to ASOCON), from: Publications Section, Department of Agriculture and Livestock PO Box 417, Konedobu, PAPUA NEW GUINEAvideo, entitled 'Lukautim Graun Bilong Yu' (Take Care of your Soil), is a 22 minute documentar...|$|R
40|$|Eight new primer {{sets were}} {{designed}} for PCR detection of (i) mono-oxygenase and dioxygenase gene sequences involved in initial attack of bacterial aerobic BTEX degradation and of (ii) catechol 2, 3 -dioxygenase gene sequences responsible for metacleavage of the aromatic ring. The new primer sets allowed detection of the corresponding genotypes in soil with a detection limit Of 10 (3) - 10 (4) or 10 (5) - 10 (6) gene <b>copies</b> g(- 1) <b>soil,</b> assuming one <b>copy</b> of the gene per cell. The primer sets were used in PCR to assess {{the distribution of the}} catabolic genes in BTEX degrading bacterial strains and DNA extracts isolated from soils sampled from different locations and depths (vadose, capillary fringe and saturated zone) within a BTEX contaminated site. In both soil DNA and the isolates, tmoA-, xylM- and xylE 1 -like genes were the most frequently recovered BTEX catabolic genes. xylM and xylE 1 were only recovered from material from the contaminated samples while tmoA was detected in material from both the contaminated and non-contaminated samples. The isolates, mainly obtained from the contaminated locations, belonged to the Actinobacteria or Proteobacteria (mainly Pseudomonas). The ability to degrade benzene was the most common BTEX degradation phenotype among them and its distribution was largely congruent with the distribution of the tmoA-like genotype. The presence of tmoA and xylM genes in phylogenetically distant strains indicated the occurrence of horizontal transfer of BTEX catabolic genes in the aquifer. Overall, these results show spatial variation in the composition of the BTEX degradation genes and hence in the type of BTEX degradation activity and pathway, at the examined site. They indicate that bacteria carrying specific pathways and primarily carrying tmoA/xylM/xylE 1 genotypes, are being selected upon BTEX contamination. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.
