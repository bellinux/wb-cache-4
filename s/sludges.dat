40|$|Treatment and {{disposal}} of excess <b>sludge</b> produced in an activated <b>sludge</b> process has become an environmental challenge in densely populated urban areas due to difficulty to locate suitable sites for landfill and incineration. Therefore, reduction/minimization of excess <b>sludge</b> within activated <b>sludge</b> processes may be an ideal solution. This study focuses {{on the use of}} a modified activated <b>sludge</b> process, named the oxic-settling-anaerobic (OSA) system, to achieve an effective reduction in excess <b>sludge</b> production. Its key feature is to insert a <b>sludge</b> holding tank in the <b>sludge</b> return circuit to provide an anaerobic <b>sludge</b> zone. The objectives of the study are to: 1) demonstrate the excess <b>sludge</b> reduction in an OSA system; 2) evaluate the appropriate operating conditions; and 3) study the mechanisms of excess <b>sludge</b> reduction, so as to maximize the excess <b>sludge</b> reduction efficiency of the OSA system. In continuous-flow studies, an OSA system was operated in parallel with an activated <b>sludge</b> process as a reference system to investigate the effects of the oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) level and the <b>sludge</b> anaerobic exposure time (SAET) in the <b>sludge</b> holding tank on the <b>sludge</b> reduction. The intended level of ORP was maintained by periodical pure nitrogen purging thus preventing the pH drop by chasing the gaseous product in the <b>sludge</b> holding tank. SAET was regulated by changing the pumping rate of the return <b>sludge</b> from settling tank. In batch studies, proposed mechanisms involving soluble microbial products (SMPs) effects, microbial population effects and <b>sludge</b> decay effects were verified. In addition, a COD balance was carried out to supplement the understanding of the mechanisms. The main findings of my research are : 1) the OSA system had a lower <b>sludge</b> yield and oxygen demand than the reference system under the same solids quantity condition, which demonstrated that an OSA system could provide a cost-effective solution for excess <b>sludge</b> reduction; 2) the OSA system improved COD removal efficiency and <b>sludge</b> settleability; 3) a low ORP in the <b>sludge</b> holding tank favored the excess <b>sludge</b> reduction; 4) low <b>sludge</b> growth yield, soluble microbial products (SMPs) effect and microbial predator contribution were unable to explain the excess <b>sludge</b> reduction; and 5) the excess <b>sludge</b> reduction in an OSA system was mainly due to increased <b>sludge</b> decay in the <b>sludge</b> holding tank under an anaerobic condition and the utilization of COD generated from the <b>sludge</b> decay through denitrification, sulfate reduction, phosphorus release and volatile organic gas production that occurred in the <b>sludge</b> holding tank of the OSA system, among which, the contribution of gaseous production was significant.

25|$|Asphalt {{was used}} {{starting}} in the 1960s as an hydrophobic matrix aiming to encapsulate radioactive waste such as medium-activity salts (mainly soluble sodium nitrate and sodium sulfate) produced by the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuels or radioactive <b>sludges</b> from sedimentation ponds. Bituminised radioactive waste containing highly radiotoxic alpha-emitting transuranic elements from nuclear reprocessing plants have been produced at industrial scale in France, Belgium and Japan, but this type of waste conditioning has been abandoned because operational safety issues (risks of fire, as occurred in a bituminisation plant at Tokai Works in Japan) and long-term stability problems related to their geological disposal in deep rock formations. One of the main problem is the swelling of asphalt exposed to radiation and to water. Asphalt swelling is first induced by radiation {{because of the presence}} of hydrogen gas bubbles generated by alpha and gamma radiolysis. A second mechanism is the matrix swelling when the encapsulated hygroscopic salts exposed to water or moisture start to rehydrate and to dissolve. The high concentration of salt in the pore solution inside the bituminised matrix is then responsible for osmotic effects inside the bituminised matrix. The water moves in the direction of the concentrated salts, the asphalt acting as a semi-permeable membrane. This also causes the matrix to swell. The swelling pressure due to osmotic effect under constant volume can be as high as 200 bar. If not properly managed, this high pressure can cause fractures in the near field of a disposal gallery of bituminised medium-level waste. When the bituminised matrix has been altered by swelling, encapsulated radionuclides are easily leached by the contact of ground water and released in the geosphere. The high ionic strength of the concentrated saline solution also favours the migration of radionuclides in clay host rocks. The presence of chemically reactive nitrate can also affect the redox conditions prevailing in the host rock by establishing oxidizing conditions, preventing the reduction of redox-sensitive radionuclides. Under their higher valences, radionuclides of elements such as selenium, technetium, uranium, neptunium and plutonium have an higher solubility and are also often present in water as non-retarded anions. This makes the disposal of medium-level bituminised waste very challenging.|$|E

Primary <b>sludge,</b> secondary <b>sludge,</b> primary &ndash; secondary <b>sludge</b> mixtures and primary &ndash; secondary &ndash; digested <b>sludge</b> mixtures behaved as non &ndash; Newtonian, shear thinning materials exhibiting a yield stress. A dimensionless form of the Herschel &ndash; Bulkely model was employed to develop master curves to predict the rheological properties of primary <b>sludge,</b> secondary <b>sludge</b> or <b>sludge</b> mixtures. Below the yield stress, primary and secondary <b>sludge</b> (with 2. 8 &ndash; 9. 2 % TS) exhibited viscoelastic behaviour similar to soft glassy materials. Primary <b>sludge</b> experienced abrupt yielding such that viscosity bifurcation was detected similar to highly thixotropic colloidal suspensions. Secondary <b>sludge</b> transitioned smoothly into the liquid regime similar to gels. Primary and secondary <b>sludge</b> flowed steadily into the liquid regime. Increasing the solids concentration of primary and secondary <b>sludge</b> increased the hydrodynamic and non &ndash; hydrodynamic interactions so that the apparent viscosity and yield stress increased following exponential and power law models as a function of total solids concentration, respectively. The apparent viscosity and yield stress of <b>sludge</b> mixtures prepared by mixing primary <b>sludge</b> (with 3, 4, 5, 6. 5 and 7. 1 %TS) to secondary <b>sludge</b> (with 3, 4, 5, 6. 5 and 7. 1 %TS) increased with increasing volume fraction of secondary <b>sludge.</b> This was attributed to the deflocculation of the weakly bound structure of primary <b>sludge</b> so that the weak colloidal particles of primary <b>sludge</b> became entrapped and entangled into the gel like network structure of secondary <b>sludge.</b> These parameters followed a power law model as a function of secondary <b>sludge</b> volume fraction. When thickened primary <b>sludge</b> (5. 4 % TS) was mixed with dilute secondary <b>sludge</b> (2. 8 %TS) and vice &ndash; versa, the apparent viscosity and yield stress of the mixed <b>sludge</b> increased with increasing volume fraction of the thickened <b>sludge</b> &ndash; regardless of <b>sludge</b> type following a power law model {{as a function of the}} volume fraction of thickened <b>sludge.</b> The apparent viscosity and yield stress of primary &ndash; secondary &ndash; digested <b>sludge</b> prepared by mixing a 50 : 50 (v/v) primary &ndash; secondary <b>sludge</b> mixture (with 3, 4, 5. 1, 6. 3, 7. 1 %TS) to digested <b>sludge</b> (with 3, 4, 5. 1, 6. 3, 7. 1 %TS) increased with increasing volume fraction of digested <b>sludge</b> so that the solid interactions within the <b>sludge</b> mixture increased &ndash; highlighted using the shear compliance and shear modulus. When a thickened primary &ndash; secondary <b>sludge</b> mixture (50 : 50 v/v and 5 % TS) was mixed with dilute digested <b>sludge</b> (1. 8 %), the apparent viscosity and yield stress decreased as the volume fraction of digested <b>sludge</b> increased. This was attributed to the dilution effect. As such, the apparent viscosity and yield stress followed a power law model as a function of volume fraction of digested <b>sludge.</b> The parameters of these models were predicted using the pH of the <b>sludge</b> mixtures.
