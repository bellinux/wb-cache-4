50|$|Republic of China Air Force: Received 115 F-5A and B from 1965, 48 were {{transferred}} to South Vietnam before 1975. From 1973 to 1986, Taiwan produced 308 F-5E/Fs under license. Later batches of locally AIDC licensed production of Tiger IIs were fitted with flare/chaff dispensers, plus handling qualities upgrades with enlarged LEX and F-20's <b>shark</b> <b>nose,</b> and radar warning receivers(RWR).|$|E
50|$|In 1969, Petty {{switched}} brands to Ford, due to {{his belief}} the Plymouth was not competitive on super-speedways; he wanted a slippery Dodge Daytona but Chrysler executives insisted he stay with Plymouth. He would win 10 races and finish second in points. Won back in 1970 by the sleek new Plymouth Superbird with <b>shark</b> <b>nose</b> and towel rack wing, Petty returned to Plymouth for the 1970 season. This is the car in which Petty is cast in the Pixar film Cars (2006), in which Richard and Lynda Petty had voice roles.|$|E

50|$|The Republic of China Air Force (ROCAF, Taiwan's air force) {{received}} its first batch of seven F-5As and two F-5Bs under the U.S. Military Assistance Program in 1965. By 1971, the ROCAF was operating 72 F-5As and 11 F-5Bs. During 1972, the U.S. borrowed 48 ROCAF F-5As to lend to the South Vietnam Air Force before {{the withdrawal of}} U.S. forces from Vietnam. By 1973, most of those loaned F-5As were not in flying condition, thus the U.S. opted to return 20 F-5As to Taiwan by drawing nine F-5As from U.S. reserves while repairing 11 from South Vietnam. These were sent to Taiwan to make necessary repairs, with gave 28 F-5Es issued to Taiwan by May 1975 in return. By 1973, Taiwan's AIDC started local production of a first batch of 100 F-5Es, the first of six Peace Tiger production batches. By end of 1986 when the production line closed after completing Peace Tiger 6, the AIDC had produced 242 F-5Es and 66 F-5Fs. Taiwan was the largest operator of the type at one time, having 336 F-5E/Fs in inventory. The last batch of AIDC F-5E/Fs featured the F-20's <b>shark</b> <b>nose.</b>|$|E
40|$|A unique F- 5 F radome wtih a {{geometry}} {{similar to}} a <b>Shark</b> <b>Nose</b> profile was tested with a high voltage Marx generator, 1, 200, 000 volts in order to demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} lightning protection system with currents from 5, 000 amperes or greater. An edge discontinuity configuration is a characteristic feature in the forward region of the radome and occasionally serves as an attachment point. The results of nineteen attachment tests at various aspect angles with an air gap of one meter indicated that no damage occurred to the dielectric material of the radom. The test proved the effectiveness of the lightning protection system...|$|E
50|$|The towers average 1000 ft {{lower in}} {{altitude}} than the highest {{mountains in the}} northern Winds, with Lizard Head Peak (12847 ft) being the tallest. Other individual mountains in the cirque include <b>Shark's</b> <b>Nose,</b> Warbonnet, Warrior Peak, Wolf's Head and Pingora Peak. There are hundreds of routes to choose from in difficulties ranging from 5.1 to 5.11a and since the mountains are composed primarily of granite rock, there is good anchoring. These climbs include two featured in Steck and Roper's Fifty Classic Climbs of North America the Northeast Face of Pingora (IV, 5.9) and the East Ridge of the Wolf's Head (III, 5.6).|$|R

5|$|In 1862, Theodore Gill {{elevated}} Hypoprion to {{the rank}} of full genus and also placed the Pondicherry shark in its own genus, Hypoprionodon, based on the relative positions of the dorsal and pectoral fins. Subsequent authors generally accepted Gill's first revision but not his second, and thus this species became known as Hypoprion hemiodon. In 1985, Jack Garrick followed up on earlier taxonomic work by Leonard Compagno and synonymized Hypoprion with Carcharhinus. Another common name for the Pondicherry <b>shark</b> is long <b>nosed</b> <b>shark.</b>|$|R
50|$|SharkDefense {{made the}} {{discovery}} of electrochemical shark repellent effects on May 1, 2006 at South Bimini, Bahamas at the Bimini Biological Field Station. An electropositive metal, which was a component of a permanent magnet, was chosen as an experimental control for a tonic immobility experiment by Eric Stroud using a juvenile lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostris). It was anticipated that this metal would produce no effect, since it was not ferromagnetic. However, a violent rousing response was observed when the metal was brought within 50 cm of the <b>shark’s</b> <b>nose.</b> The experiment was repeated with three other juvenile lemon sharks and two other juvenile nurse sharks (Ginglymostoma cirratum), and care was taken to eliminate all stray metal objects in the testing site. Patrick Rice, Michael Herrmann, and Eric Stroud were present at this first trial. Mike Rowe, from Discovery Channel’s Dirty Jobs series, subsequently witnessed and participated in a test using an electropositive metal within 24 hours after the discovery.|$|R
60|$|Brown {{brought the}} word in from the outpost among the rocks a hundred yards away. Grief was squatted over a small fire, broiling a strip of shark-flesh. The last twenty-four hours had been lucky. Seaweed and sea urchins had been gathered. Tehaa had caught a shark, and Mauriri had {{captured}} a fair-sized octopus {{at the base of}} the crevice where the dynamite was stored. Then, too, in the darkness they had made two successful swims for water before the tiger <b>sharks</b> had <b>nosed</b> them out.|$|R
5000|$|Slingships : The {{interceptor}} spaceship {{of choice}} {{used by the}} Space Rangers. Unlike other ships, it does not need a lightspeed ring to achieve hyperspace as it can use a planet's orbital gravity to sling itself. It can still use lightspeed rings to conserve fuel. Captain John Boon's team are assigned Ranger Slingship #377. It has been nicknamed [...] "Tin Lizzie" [...] by its flight engineer Doc Kreuger and there are <b>shark</b> teeth <b>nose</b> art, much like pilots did to their fighter planes back in Earth's World War II-era. Slingship #377 has seen better days as Doc has had to jury rig many of the ships parts and systems to keep it online, as budget cuts have prevented them from always getting the proper parts and repairs.|$|R
5000|$|Homer {{tries to}} comfort a heartbroken Lisa, while Bart and Milhouse, {{who plan to}} poke Bluella with a stick, return {{to the beach and}} {{discover}} the police are going to blow up the whale carcass, as it cannot stay on the beach. The results are disastrous and blubber is everywhere, prompting the townspeople to use Bluella's remains for products such as corsets and perfume. Lisa sadly walks through town, where every squeaky noise reminds her of Bluella. She winds up at the beach, where she spots two whale calves [...] - [...] presumed to be Bluella's offspring [...] - [...] surrounded by sharks. Homer suddenly appears with a boat (which he had apparently offered to test drive) and a harpoon and they rush to the rescue, only to be stopped by two eco-activists, who caution Lisa that being an eco-activist means supporting all forms of life (including sharks but excluding cockroaches). Lisa agrees and stops Homer from shooting the sharks, but he inadvertently falls overboard. The eco-activists advise Homer to hit the <b>sharks</b> on the <b>nose</b> with a steel pail, which will either cause them to retreat or make the sharks devour Homer faster. When the eco-activists throw the pail to Homer, it strikes him in the head causing him to bleed and even more sharks arrive and circle Homer. Fortunately, the whale calves' father appears and rescues the young whales and Homer, driving the sharks away. In the end, the Simpson family watches the three whales swim out to sea, confident that they will thrive. Homer assumes that the whale will get married to a [...] "sexy lady octopus", and that a [...] "little whale-upus is on the way!" [...] Marge then suggests that they draw pictures of that tonight. Over the ending credits, the song [...] "La Mer" [...] plays while the pictures the Simpsons drew are shown.|$|R
