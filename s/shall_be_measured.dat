The faithfulness of his extracts from books has been fully verified. The awful death of Dorothy Mately, of Ashover, in Derbyshire, mentioned, I had an opportunity of testing, by the aid of my kind friend, Thomas Bateman, Esq., of Yolgrave. He sent me the following extract from the Ashover Register for 1660:--'Dorothy Mately, supposed wife to John Flint of this parish, forswore herself; whereupon the ground opened, and she sunk over head, March 23, and being found dead, she was buried, March 25.' Thus fully confirming the facts, as stated by Bunyan. Solemn providences, intended, in the inscrutable wisdom of God, for wise purposes, must not be always called 'divine judgments.' A ship is lost, and the good with the bad, sink together; a missionary is murdered; a pious Malay is martyred; still no one can suppose that these are instances of divine vengeance.

The second general head, that is {{contained}} in this law, to be opened at this day is, its exactness, and purity, and strictness as to all acts of good that any poor creature hath done in this life, whereby he in the judgment will think to shelter, or secure himself from the wrath of God. This is the rule, and line, and plummet, whereby every act of every man <b>shall</b> <b>be</b> <b>measured</b> (Rom 3:21,22); and he whose righteousness is not found every way answerable to this law, which all will fall short of, but they that have the righteousness of God by faith in Jesus Christ: he must perish, as he saith, [...] "Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place" [...] (Isa 28:17). That is, though men may not shelter themselves under legal repentance, cold profession, good meaning, thinkings, and doings: yet all these things must be measured, and weighed {{in the balance of}} God's most righteous law: and, as I said, whatever in that day is not found the righteousness of God, it will be found a refuge of lies, and will be drowned by the overflowing of the wrath of God, as the waters of Noah overflowed the world. And hence it is that all the ungodly will at this day, be found as stubble, and the law as fire (Mal 4:1). As it saith, [...] "From his right hand went a fiery law" [...] (Deu 33:2). And again, [...] "His lips are full of indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire" [...] (Isa 30:27). For as fire, where it seizeth, doth burn, eat, destroy, devour and consume: so will the law, all those that at this day, shall be found under the transgression of the least tittle of it. It will be with these souls at the day of judgment, as it is with those countries that are overrun with most merciless conquerors, who leave not anything behind them, but swallow up all with fire and sword. [...] "For by fire, and by his sword, will the Lord plead with all flesh: and the slain of the Lord shall be many" [...] (Isa 66:16). There are two things at the day of judgment, will meet in their height and utmost strength, and they are sin and the law; for the judgment will not be, till the iniquity of the world be full ripe (Joel 3:13; Rev 14:15-20).|$|E

One of the supports <b>shall</b> <b>be</b> fixed and the other <b>shall</b> <b>be</b> a roller. The clear span between supports <b>shall</b> <b>be</b> 254 mm (see Figures 1 and 2). The radius of the upper portion of the fixed support and the radius of the roller <b>shall</b> <b>be</b> 8 mm. A dial indicator <b>shall</b> <b>be</b> firmly mounted so that the stem of the dial indicator is midway between the specimen supports, and at the center of the test specimen in a transverse direction. A hole <b>shall</b> <b>be</b> provided through the base at mid-span to accommodate the hook assembly. 2. Hook Assembly: A hook assembly for applying the load at the midpoint of the specimen shall have a smooth upper bearing surface to accept the spindle of the dial indicator, and a hole in the lower end for attaching the loading mass. The rounded surface in contact with the specimen shall have a radius of 10 mm. 3. Loading Mass: A total mass of 3. 00 kg (including the mass of the hook assembly) <b>shall</b> <b>be</b> used to apply the load to the specimen. (The mass creates a flexural stress of approximately 0. 71 MPa in the outer-most fiber of a specimen having a cross-sectional area of 625 mm 2.) 4.

Secondly, if we rescale one of the variables e.g., measure in grams rather than kilograms, then we shall end up with different results (a different curve). To avoid this problem of incommensurability it is sometimes suggested that we convert to dimensionless variables—this may be called normalization or standardization. However there are various ways of doing this, and these lead to fitted models which are not equivalent to each other. One approach is to normalize by known (or estimated) measurement precision thereby minimizing the Mahalanobis distance from the points to the line, providing a maximum-likelihood solution; the unknown precisions could be found via analysis of variance.|$|R
