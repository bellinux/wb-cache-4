5|$|Invert sugars and syrups are blended to {{manufacturers}} specifications and {{are used}} in breads, cakes, and beverages for adjusting <b>sweetness,</b> aiding moisture retention and avoiding crystallization of sugars.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} art of music sought purity, limpidity and <b>sweetness</b> of sound. Then {{different}} sounds were amalgamated, care being taken, however, to caress the ear with gentle harmonies. Today music, as it becomes continually more complicated, strives to amalgamate the most dissonant, strange and harsh sounds. In this way we come ever closer to noise-sound.|$|E
5|$|Hot chocolate, {{also known}} as hot cocoa, {{drinking}} chocolate or just cocoa is a heated beverage consisting of shaved chocolate, melted chocolate or cocoa powder, heated milk or water, and usually a sweetener. Hot chocolate may be topped with whipped cream. Hot chocolate made with melted chocolate is sometimes called drinking chocolate, characterized by less <b>sweetness</b> and a thicker consistency.|$|E
5|$|Andjar {{directed}} two further {{films for}} South Pacific, Anggrek Bulan and Gadis Desa (Maiden from the Village; 1949). Ratna had no further acting roles, although in 1950 she became Indonesia's first female director with Sedap Malam (<b>Sweetness</b> of the Night), for Djamaluddin Malik's company Persari. Ali, Iskandar, and Djauhari remained active as actors, Ali and Iskandar through the 1960s and Djauhari until the 1970s. SPFC made another six films before shutting {{down at the}} end of the Indonesian National Revolution in 1949. A 35mm copy of Djaoeh Dimata is stored at Sinematek Indonesia in Jakarta.|$|E
5|$|Ayumi is Yuu's and Shunsuke's {{energetic}} {{younger sister}} {{in junior high}} school. She has an innocent personality and deeply cares for Yuu, providing moral support to him. Ayumi often cooks for Yuu and {{has a tendency to}} add pizza sauce to every food she makes, unaware that Yuu's modern tastes cannot handle the <b>sweetness.</b> She is a fan of the band How-Low-Hello and an avid admirer of Yusa. She eventually awakens an ability to cause anything around her to suddenly collapse, but this is stolen by Yuu to prevent her death.|$|E
5|$|Both written {{history and}} {{molecular}} genetic {{studies indicate that}} the domestic carrot has a single origin in Central Asia. Its wild ancestors probably originated in Persia (regions of which are now Iran and Afghanistan), which remains the centre of diversity for the wild carrot Daucus carota. A naturally occurring subspecies of the wild carrot was presumably bred selectively over the centuries to reduce bitterness, increase <b>sweetness</b> and minimise the woody core; this process produced the familiar garden vegetable.|$|E
5|$|Granulated sugars {{are used}} at the table, to {{sprinkle}} on foods and to sweeten hot drinks (coffee and tea), and in home baking to add <b>sweetness</b> and texture to baked products (cookies and cakes) and desserts (pudding and ice cream). They are also used as a preservative to prevent micro-organisms from growing and perishable food from spoiling, as in candied fruits, jams, and marmalades.|$|E
5|$|In Germany, {{sugar levels}} {{at time of}} harvest are an {{important}} consideration in the wine's production with prädikat levels measuring the <b>sweetness</b> of the wine. Equally important to winegrowers is the balance of acidity between the green tasting malic acid and the more citrus tasting tartaric acid. In cool years, some growers will wait until November to harvest in hopes of having {{a higher level of}} ripeness and subsequent tartaric acid.|$|E
5|$|Sucrose {{is found}} in the stems of {{sugarcane}} and roots of sugar beet. It also occurs naturally alongside fructose and glucose in other plants, in particular fruits and some roots such as carrots. The different proportions of sugars found in these foods determines the range of <b>sweetness</b> experienced when eating them. A molecule of sucrose is formed by the combination of a molecule of glucose with a molecule of fructose. After being eaten, sucrose is split into its constituent parts during digestion by a number of enzymes known as sucrases.|$|E
5|$|The first barcarolle was {{dedicated}} to the pianist Caroline de Serres (Mme. Caroline Montigny-Rémaury) and premiered by Saint-Saëns at a concert of the Société Nationale de Musique in 1882. The piece begins with an uncomplicated melody in a traditional lilting Venetian style in 6/8 time. It develops into a more elaborate form before {{the introduction of the}} second theme, in which the melodic line is given in the middle register with delicate arpeggiated accompaniments in the treble and bass. Morrison comments that even in this early work, conventional <b>sweetness</b> is enlivened by subtle dissonance.|$|E
5|$|The <b>sweetness</b> {{of carrots}} allows the {{vegetable}} {{to be used}} in some fruit-like roles. Grated carrots are used in carrot cakes, as well as carrot puddings, an English dish thought to have originated in the early 19th century. Carrots can also be used alone or blended with fruits in jams and preserves. Carrot juice is also widely marketed, especially as a health drink, either stand-alone or blended with juices extracted from fruits and other vegetables.|$|E
5|$|Wine critics {{considered}} white Zinfandel to be insipid and uninteresting in the 1970s and 1980s, although modern white Zinfandels {{have more}} fruit and less cloying <b>sweetness.</b> Nevertheless, {{the success of}} this blush wine saved many old vines in premium areas, which came into their own {{at the end of the}} 20th century as red Zinfandel wines came back into fashion. Although the two wines taste dramatically different, both are made from the same (red) grapes, processed in a different way.|$|E
5|$|Andjar's {{screenplay}} Dr Samsi {{was finally}} adapted {{as a film}} in 1952 by Ratna Asmara, who had become Indonesia's first female film director with her 1950 film Sedap Malam (<b>Sweetness</b> of the Night). The adaptation starred Ratna and Raden Ismail. It would prove Andjar's last screenwriting credit during his lifetime. Although no longer writing films, Andjar remained active in the country's film industry. In 1955 he headed the inaugural Indonesian Film Festival, which was criticized when it gave the Best Picture Award to two films, Usmar Ismail's Lewat Djam Malam (After the Curfew) and Lilik Sudjio's Tarmina. Critics wrote that Lewat Djam Malam was easily the stronger of the two and suggested that Djamaluddin Malik, Tarmina producer, had influenced the jury's decision.|$|E
5|$|As bacon {{ice cream}} {{was created in}} 1992 and came to {{prominence}} in the 2000s, there is no traditional recipe. Recipes generally involve adding bacon to a standard sweet ice cream recipe, often vanilla but other suggestions include coffee, rum or pecan. The saltiness of the bacon highlights the <b>sweetness</b> of the ice cream. According to one Wired.com article, the bacon should be candied prior to addition, a process which involves baking the bacon in a sugar syrup. This has the benefit of sweetening the bacon, {{in a similar manner}} to pancakes {{in some parts of the}} United States.|$|E
5|$|Early {{researchers}} tasted beryllium and {{its various}} compounds for <b>sweetness</b> {{in order to}} verify its presence. Modern diagnostic equipment no longer necessitates this highly risky procedure and no attempt {{should be made to}} ingest this highly toxic substance. Beryllium and its compounds should be handled with great care and special precautions must be taken when carrying out any activity which could result in the release of beryllium dust (lung cancer is a possible result of prolonged exposure to beryllium-laden dust). Although the use of beryllium compounds in fluorescent lighting tubes was discontinued in 1949, potential for exposure to beryllium exists in the nuclear and aerospace industries and in the refining of beryllium metal and melting of beryllium-containing alloys, the manufacturing of electronic devices, and the handling of other beryllium-containing material.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to other Alsatian wines, Rieslings d'Alsace {{are usually not}} meant to be drunk young, but many are still best in the first years. Rieslings d'Alsace tend to be mostly very dry with a cleansing acidity. They are thick-bodied wines that coat the palate. These wines age exceptionally well with a quality vintage aging up to 20 years. This is beneficial since the flavours in an Alsace wine will often open up after three years, developing softer and fruitier flavours. Riesling is very suitable for the late harvest Vendange Tardive and the botrytized Sélection de Grains Nobles, with good acidity keeping up the <b>sweetness</b> of the wine.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo was a {{contemporary}} of Botticelli, Domenico Ghirlandaio and Perugino, {{who were all}} slightly older than he was. He would have met them at the workshop of Verrocchio, with whom they had associations, and at the Academy of the Medici. Botticelli was a particular favourite of the Medici family, and thus his success as a painter was assured. Ghirlandaio and Perugino were both prolific and ran large workshops. They competently delivered commissions to well-satisfied patrons who appreciated Ghirlandaio's ability to portray the wealthy citizens of Florence within large religious frescoes, and Perugino's ability to deliver a multitude of saints and angels of unfailing <b>sweetness</b> and innocence.|$|E
5|$|Red maple is {{also used}} for the {{production}} of maple syrup, though the hard maples Acer saccharum (sugar maple) and Acer nigrum (black maple) are more commonly utilized. One study compared the sap and syrup from the sugar maple with those of the red maple, {{as well as those of}} the Acer saccharinum (silver maple), Acer negundo (boxelder), and Acer platanoides (Norway maple), and all were found to be equal in <b>sweetness,</b> flavor, and quality. However, the buds of red maple and other soft maples emerge much earlier in the spring than the sugar maple, and after sprouting chemical makeup of the sap changes, imparting an undesirable flavor to the syrup. This being the case, red maple can only be tapped for syrup before the buds emerge, making the season very short.|$|E
5|$|Riesling is {{the second}} leading white grape varietal after the {{indigenous}} Grüner Veltliner. Austrian Riesling is generally thick bodied, coating the palate and producing a strong clarity of flavour coupled with a mouthwatering aroma. A particular Austrian Riesling trademark is a long finish that includes hints of white pepper. It flourishes in the cool climate and free-draining granite and mica soil of the Wachau region where Austrian wine laws allow for irrigation. With levels normally around 13% it has a relatively high alcohol content for Riesling and is generally at its peak after 5 years. Austrian Riesling is not known for its <b>sweetness</b> and is mostly dry with very few grapes affected by botrytis.|$|E
5|$|Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, {{is widely}} celebrated with festive family meals and {{symbolic}} foods. <b>Sweetness</b> {{is the main}} theme and the Rosh Hashana dinners typically begin with apples dipped in honey, and end with honey cake. The challah is usually round, often studded with raisins and drizzled with honey, and other symbolic fruits and vegetables are eaten as an entree, such as pomegranates, carrots, leeks and beets. Fish dishes, symbolizing abundance, are served; for example, gefilte fish is traditional for Ashkenazim, while Moroccan Jews prepare the spicy fish dish, chraime. Honey cake (lekach) is often served as dessert, accompanied by tea or coffee.|$|E
5|$|Sugar {{has been}} {{produced}} in the Indian subcontinent since ancient times. It was not plentiful or cheap in early times and honey was more often used for sweetening {{in most parts of}} the world. Originally, people chewed raw sugarcane to extract its <b>sweetness.</b> Sugarcane was a native of tropical South Asia and Southeast Asia. Different species seem to have originated from different locations with Saccharum barberi originating in India and S. edule and S. officinarum coming from New Guinea. One of the earliest historical references to sugarcane is in Chinese manuscripts dating back to 8th century BC that state that the use of sugarcane originated in India.|$|E
5|$|Carrot soup can be {{prepared}} as a cream-style soup and as a broth-style soup. Vegetable stock or chicken stock {{can be used as}} ingredients in both styles of soup. Other vegetables may be used in the dish, including root vegetables, the latter of which may include garlic onion, shallot, potato, turnip and others. Carrot juice and orange juice can be used in its preparation, and some versions are prepared using puréed carrot. After cooking, the dish can be run through a sieve to strain it. The carrots used can be peeled or unpeeled, and the use of peeled carrots can lend to increased smoothness in puréed versions of the dish. Those prepared with puréed carrot may have a thick consistency while also being smooth in texture. The soup's color can vary based upon the coloration of the carrots used. Young carrots tend to make the soup sweeter and imbue it with a bright orange coloration, while older, larger carrots provide less <b>sweetness</b> and may imbue a yellow coloration. The use of old, cracked carrots that have a woody texture in their interior can produce a soup of inferior quality.|$|E
25|$|The {{scent of}} {{liquorice}} root {{comes from a}} complex and variable combination of compounds, of which anethole is up to 3% of total volatiles. Much of the <b>sweetness</b> in liquorice comes from glycyrrhizin, which has a sweet taste, 30–50 times the <b>sweetness</b> of sugar. The <b>sweetness</b> {{is very different from}} sugar, being less instant, tart, and lasting longer.|$|E
25|$|The <b>sweetness</b> of wines is {{determined}} by the amount of residual sugar left in the wine after the fermentation process. Wines can be bone dry (with the sugars fully fermented into alcohol), off-dry (with a hint of <b>sweetness),</b> semi-dry (medium-sweet) and dessert level <b>sweetness</b> (such as the high sugar content in Sauternes and Tokays). Sweet wines often need to be sweeter than the dish they are served with. Vintage brut champagne paired with sweet, wedding cake can make the wine taste tart and weak while the cake will have off flavors. In food pairings, <b>sweetness</b> balances spice and heat. It can serve as a contrast to the heat and alleviate some of the burning sensation caused by peppers and spicy Asian cuisine. It can accentuate the mild <b>sweetness</b> in some foods and can also contrast with salt such as the European custom of pairing salty Stilton cheese with a sweet Port. <b>Sweetness</b> in a wine can balance tartness in food, especially if the food has some <b>sweetness</b> (such as dishes with sweet & sour sauces).|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} sugar (dosage) added {{after the second}} {{fermentation}} and aging varies and will dictate the <b>sweetness</b> level of the sparkling wine. Wines produced within the European Union must include the <b>sweetness</b> level on the wine label. For wines produced outside the EU, the <b>sweetness</b> level is not required {{but if it is}} included on the label the terms used must conform to EU guidelines.|$|E
25|$|As Vouvray {{can be made}} in a {{wide range}} of <b>sweetness</b> styles, the wine labels may {{indicate}} the <b>sweetness</b> level by the terms Sec, Demi-Sec, Moelleux and Doux. While these terms are not strictly defined, they tend to roughly fall into the guidelines below. Note that the residual sugar level may not equate to the level of <b>sweetness</b> that a taster will perceive in the wine due to balance of acidity in the wine. In some cases a producer's Demi-Sec wine may taste drier than their Sec. Sparkling Vouvray may also have the <b>sweetness</b> level indicated on the label.|$|E

25|$|Honey {{gets its}} <b>sweetness</b> from the monosaccharides {{fructose}} and glucose, and has {{about the same}} relative <b>sweetness</b> as granulated sugar. It has attractive chemical properties for baking and a distinctive flavor when used as a sweetener. Most microorganisms do not grow in honey, so sealed honey does not spoil, even after thousands of years.|$|E
25|$|Artificial {{sweeteners}} contain {{little or}} no food energy, making a comparison of <b>sweetness</b> based on energy content not meaningful.|$|E
25|$|Because Madeira has a {{very high}} acidity, it can be paired with any food, even citrus or balsamic. Also, {{although}} it is sweet, even the Malmsey has a dry finish, so it does not get killed by the <b>sweetness</b> of desserts and pudding. This makes it the most versatile of all dessert wines. Whereas most sweet wines are rendered dry by the <b>sweetness</b> of the dessert, this does not happen with Madeira.|$|E
25|$|Blonde Lager is a light-bodied Munich Helles-style lager with a grainy character, a faint <b>sweetness,</b> and {{a bitter}} finish.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sweetness</b> is {{produced}} {{by the presence of}} sugars, some proteins, and a few other substances. It is often connected to aldehydes and ketones, which contain a carbonyl group. <b>Sweetness</b> is detected by a variety of G protein-coupled receptors coupled to a G protein that acts as an intermediary in the communication between taste bud and brain, gustducin. These receptors are T1R2+3 (heterodimer) and T1R3 (homodimer), which account for sweet sensing in humans and other animals.|$|E
