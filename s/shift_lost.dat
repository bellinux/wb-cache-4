40|$|Abstract: This study {{investigated}} the injuries sustained by an Australian specialist police division. Injury records spanning four-years were analyzed. The role being performed when the injury occurred, injury cause, body part injured, and injury-related costs were quantified. The percentage of personnel injured multiple times was documented. One hundred and thirty eight personnel reported injuries, 58 of these on multiple occasions. This resulted in 229 injuries and 76 claims being raised. Half of the injuries occurred during operational policing tasks, however training activities accounted for> 30 % of injuries. The most common injury was strain/sprain, and upper body injuries were 2. 5 -times more common than lower-body or torso injuries. 1107 <b>shifts</b> were <b>lost,</b> and injuries cost the organization $ 487, 159 (Australian Dollars) over the four-year period. The injury costs (both financial and in manpower) may prompt policy makers to review the current training and post-injury rehabilitation protocols...|$|R

The following month, Troyes were eliminated from the competition after losing 1-0 to Nice with Westberg playing the full 90 minutes. In the Coupe de France, Troyes, with Westberg in goal, earned victories over amateur clubs Forbach (1-0) and Jarville (3-1) in the 7th and 8th round, respectively. In the following round against Montpellier, Westberg was replaced by domestic starter Cyrille Merville. Despite the <b>shift,</b> Troyes <b>lost</b> the match 1-0.

30|$|As well, {{with the}} initial {{software}} version, the track function rarely appeared to work. This was a disappointment to us, as the hope with this function is that the drive would automatically correct for any shift in the probe during recording. There were two issues we found with this function in the initial software version. First, despite being enable, it was rarely triggered, even in the rare case when the headframe/probe <b>shifted</b> and <b>lost</b> signal. Second, when the track function was triggered, and we could audibly identify that the robotic drive was attempting to move the TCD probe, however, it never appeared to accurately correct the probe for signal loss. Both issues were likely a result of inefficiencies in the embedded algorithm for the track function. As with the scan function, our concerns were raised with the manufacturer and resolved with a subsequent, most recent version of the software. Trialing this updated software version on additional patients, the track function was correctly engaged during shift of the probe, and corrected the probe position/angle, optimizing the CBFV signal.|$|R

40|$|The article {{examines}} the ideological diversity within the Australian Croatian community and its implications in the processes of disintegration including language <b>shift</b> and <b>lost</b> of identity {{in the second and}} third generation of immigrants. The article argues that there are three original ideological patterns, which were developed in the period from 1945 to 1992 and are mutually exclusive. It also argues the point that this type of diversity among two poles in the community has contributed to the process of disintegration within the community itself. To examine the options in a process in which the preservation of Croatian heritage in Australia can continue, one hast to take into consideration both, these ideologically determined origins of community and Census data which indicate dramatic shifts from major points of community identification {{in the second and third}} generation. The possible options within this process of disintegration are discussed in a final part of the article. In the conclusion it is also suggested that ideologically determined media outlets and Australian Croatian umbrella organisations are not in a position to provide the appropriate strategic plan for future processes in community survival.

50|$|Choices of {{equipment}} tend more towards the idiosyncratic than in road racing; for example single-speed bicycles {{also have some}} popularity due {{to the advantage of}} mechanical simplicity in the often very muddy conditions and the fringe nature of the sport. Gearing is typically lower, with most common setups using a 46-36 (110mm BCD) or 48-38 (130mm BCD) chainring combination with a 12-25 to 12-30 cassette. Some riders opt to use a single chainring in the front (typically a 40-42 tooth chainring) while retaining multiple sprockets in the rear cassette. This has some of the advantages of the single-speed: the weight of the front derailleur and the front <b>shift</b> lever are <b>lost,</b> a single chainring allows for a tighter chainline, thus reducing the chance of throwing a chain on a bumpy course, and further, racing is psychologically simpler.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The SAINT I {{trial that}} showed a {{significant}} benefit of the neuroprotectant NXY- 059 used a novel outcome for acute ischemic stroke trials: a shift toward good functional outcome on the 7 -category modified Rankin scale (mRS). METHODS: We used the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel shift test to analyze {{the distribution of the}} 90 -day mRS outcomes in the NINDS and ECASS-II databases and compared the results with a dichotomized mRS outcome by logistic regression (0 to 2 vs 3 to 6, or 0 to 1 vs 2 to 6). We also stratified each dataset based on National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale baseline severity. RESULTS: Each dataset showed a statistically significant shift in the 90 -day mRS distributions favoring tissue plasminogen activator (odds ratio, 1. 6 for NINDS, 1. 3 for ECASS-II). For ECASS-II, larger shift effects appeared in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 0 to 6 and 16 to 40 strata. Similarly, the mRS 0 to 2 analysis but not mRS 0 to 1 found similar treatment effects in both datasets (odds ratio, 1. 6 for NINDS, 1. 5 for ECASS-II) and similar variations in the low and high strata in the ECASS-II trial. NINDS found no significant treatment effects across the strata. After removing the strata at the fringes, the <b>shift</b> test <b>lost</b> significance in both datasets. CONCLUSIONS: Tissue plasminogen activator causes a beneficial shift toward wellness on the mRS in both the NINDS and ECASS-II trials, and ECASS-II would have been a positive trial according to the shift approach. However, the shift effect is not global for all treated patients and does not outperform the dichotomized 0 to 2 outcome. Patients with mild and severe deficits also shifted favorably on the mRS in the ECASS-II trial...|$|R
40|$|Access to {{groundwater}} of {{good quality}} may {{in some places}} be limited. The Geological Surveyof Sweden (SGU) has {{for the first time}} in Sweden used Sky-TEM (Danish developed systemfor measurements with Transient Electromagnetic by helicopter) in an area of Skåne tomeasure the resistivity of the ground and thus identify areas with saline groundwater. Thisthesis has its basis in the comparison between those Sky-TEM measurements and fieldworkwith geoelectrical measurements (electrical resistivity measurement with a multi-electrodesystem) The geoelectrical measurements were carried out along two profiles in the area of theprivios Sky-TEM measurements. One of the profiles (Annero) in an area where the depthdown to the saline groundwater were interpreted to be large, and the other (Lillevångsgatan) in an area where the depth was interpreted to be small. The interpretations of Sky-TEM and geoelectrical measurements were not entirely inagreement with each other. They both showed a greater depth to the saline groundwater atAnnero and a smaller depth at Lillevång, but also that measurements with Sky-TEMsystematically pointed to a greater depth to the saline groundwater compared to thegeoelectrical. It could be derived from that TEM works best at low resistivities (< 100 ohm-m) and electrical resistivity measurements are good at detecting contrasts between differentresistivities. The saline groundwater has a low resistivity (< 10 ohm-m) and its surface createsno clear contrast. It is thus likely that the interpretation of the Sky-TEM measurements liesclosest to the truth. Measurements with Sky TEM provide good overall data but not as good detailed data. Many smaller geological formations and <b>shifts</b> are <b>lost</b> in interpretations of Sky-TEM data,these can however be more effectively detect the geoelectrical method. Sky-TEM is a goodmethod when large areas need to be examined and when the data does not have to be toodetailed.

To get a good interpretation of how the ground looks like in the area requires acombination of both Sky-TEM measurements and geoelectrical measurements.

40|$|To {{clarify the}} {{molecular}} mechanisms of nitric oxide (NO) signalling, {{we examined the}} NO-responsive proteins in cultured human endothelial cells by two-dimensional (2 D) PAGE. Levels of two proteins [NO-responsive proteins (NORPs) ] with different pI values responded to NO donors. One NORP (pI 5. 2) appeared in response to NO, whereas another (pI 5. 0) disappeared. These proteins were identified as a native form and a modified form of human glyoxalase I (Glox I; EC 4. 4. 1. 5) by peptide mapping, microsequencing and correlation between the activity and the isoelectric <b>shift.</b> Glox I <b>lost</b> activity in response to NO, and all NO donors tested inhibited its activity in a dose-dependent manner. Activity and normal electrophoretic mobility were restored by dithiothreitol and by the removal of sources of NO from the culture medium. Glox I was selectively inactivated by NO; compounds that induce oxidative stress (H(2) O(2), paraquat and arsenite) failed to inhibit this enzyme. Our results suggest that NO oxidatively modifies Glox I and reversibly inhibits the enzyme's activity. The inactivation of Glox I by NO was more effective than that of glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 3 PDH), another NO-sensitive enzyme. Thus Glox I {{seems to be a}} novel NO-responsive protein that is more sensitive to NO than G 3 PDH...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{calls for}} an {{increase}} in multi-disciplinary research on the issue of alcohol and ageing, to ensure public health interventions reflect the complex and diverse needs of older drinkers. Older people (65 + years) represent a unique segment of the population; compared to adolescents and younger people, {{they are more likely to}} have a range of co-morbid conditions and be taking prescribed medication, and are more physiologically vulnerable to the effects of alcohol. This suggests that from a public health perspective, alcohol use by older people is problematic. However, as with younger people, alcohol use is closely associated with socialisation and social engagement. While social engagement is important at all stages of life, it is particularly critical as people age, when many of the formal social roles which provide a catalyst for social integration <b>shift</b> or are <b>lost.</b> Currently, however, there is little evidence of an integrated public health response to the complex issue of alcohol and ageing. That is, what is needed is a concurrent acknowledgement of the health problems that may be associated with contraindicated alcohol use, versus the potential health benefits that can accrue from social drinking. This will require a holistic rather than reductionist approach that integrates biomedical and social science insights to develop a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the implications of alcohol use amongst diverse populations of older people...|$|R
40|$|The Deepwater Horizon {{oil spill}} of 2010 {{significantly}} impacted the Gulf Coast economy. The {{aim of this}} paper is to determine the adequacy of Deepwater Horizon Economic Settlement payments in achieving full recovery and restoration of the Gulf Coast economy. This paper contextualizes the event, analyzes other disaster techniques, and discusses the impact of the oil spill on dominant coastal industries. The results are constructed through linear regression models on employment figures for the coastal counties of all five Gulf states. An argument for each state is formed based upon the regression results, supplemented with outside sources and additional data as needed. So as to narrow the scope of the project, only data for counties on the Gulf Coast are included. Limitations of the study are discussed in the conclusion. The key findings are as follows: • The Deepwater Horizon Economic Settlement reparation payments have been adequate for the economic recovery of Texas and Florida. • The Deepwater Horizon Economic Settlement reparation payments have been sufficient for economic growth in Louisiana. Slight additional compensation may be needed to achieve complete recovery. • The Deepwater Horizon Economic Settlement reparation payments have been inadequate for the economic recovery of Mississippi and Alabama. Additional research should be done to account for the effects of temporary employment, <b>shifting</b> demographics, and <b>lost</b> revenue in 2010...|$|R

After the twenties, critics {{created an}} image (the first paradigm shift) of irresponsibility, immorality and {{excess of the}} Lost Generation Writers. They were criticized for their nihilistic attitude towards life. On the one hand critics and writers were fascinated by the Lost Genration, on the other they condemned their way of thinking. The second paradigm shift {{took place during the}} Second World War. Because of the war, many critics and writers could now relate to the things the (other post-war) Lost Generation wrote about. The Lost Generation were seen by the New Generation (born 1918 - 1925) as their "literary forefathers". This thesis will argue that the depression {{played an important role in}} the creation of the image of the thirties of the Lost Generation Writers. Morals and values were very important to the critics and writers of the thirties and they emphasized that the Lost Generation had not known proper morals, because they wrote about music, sexuality and disillusionment. The writers and critics of the thirties focused primarily on the social aspects of the Lost Generation novels. During the war a New Generation started publicizing their views. They embraced the Lost Generation. Because of the war they could relate to the feelings of disillusionment.

After presenting a brief summary of the most significant recent art-historical publications on the subject, the text offers an analysis of the themes developed thus far in the bibliography on the subject: antiquity and the Monte Cassino; narrative; atlantic Bibles; writing and image; theory of "reformed" art; patrons. It then proposes an analysis of the Corpus della pittura medievale romana, published in 2006, which represents a fundamental link between previous studies and new orientations in research. The argument developed covers two time periods, the 11 (th) and 12 (th) centuries respectively, and presents not only the principal discoveries of the Corpus (stylistic and compositional comparisons, chronological <b>shifts,</b> examination of <b>lost</b> works, renewal of themes studied), but also the contribution of later publications and the ongoing critical debate. The article delves into three examples in particular: the wood-panel painting of the Last Judgment housed in the Musei Vaticani, the cycle of paintings from the lower basilica of San Crisogono, and paintings from the lower church of San Clemente. As for the 12 (th) century, the article presents research undertaken on the mosaics of San Bortolomeo all'isola, San Clemente, and Santa Maria in Trastevere. It concludes with an analysis of cycles of imagery still preserved within the former territory of Latium related, either through their subject matter or artistically, to the Roman tradition and the connection between the "reformed" art of Rome and larger European culture. ITALIANO La decorazione monumentale realizzata a Roma tra i secoli XI e XII è un tema largamente affrontato dalla storiografia critica. L'articolo ripercorre gli ultimi dieci anni di studi, mettendoli in prospettiva e individuano i principali assi tematici che hanno animato il dibattito. Alla luce delle scoperte recenti e delle pubblicazioni che si sono succedute, emerge un quadro complesso dell'arte durante la Riforma della Chiesa che arricchisce e corregge gli studi del passato...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} was to use hip {{abductor}} fatigue to perturb those who do and do not develop pain from standing and determine changes in muscular and postural responses. 	Forty young healthy participants performed two sessions of standing work for two hours each. Participants performed a side-lying leg raising exercise to fatigue prior {{to one of the}} standing sessions, the other session acted as a control. Surface electromyography (EMG) of six muscles bilaterally, motion capture of the trunk and lower limbs, and force plate data under each foot were measured continuously during each standing session. Self-reported pain and isometric hip abductor strength were assessed at discrete time points using 100 mm visual analog scales and uni-axial force transducers respectively. Participants were classified as pain developers (PDs) or non-pain developers (NPDs) based on a 10 mm threshold in low back pain scores during the control session. 	PDs (16 / 40) reported decreases in low back pain while standing during the fatigue session (10. 9 ± 11. 7 mm reduction) while NPDs reported minimal changes in pain with fatigue (1. 5 ± 3. 9 mm increase). Decreases in trunk (1033. 9 ± 528. 6 %MVIC reduction in first hour) and gluteal cocontraction indices (398. 8 ± 792. 4 %MVIC decrease in the 15 minute block) and increases in the number of anterior-posterior centre of pressure fidgets (13. 5 ± 25. 4 increase in the 30 minute block) were observed in the first hour of the fatigue session in PDs. Female PDs had more posterior pelvic tilt with fatigue (3. 9 ± 9. 2 ° more posterior with fatigue from 30 to 90 minutes), distinguishing them from male PDs (7. 0 ± 11. 3 ° more anterior with fatigue from 15 to 120 minutes). Both pain groups had similar EMG frequency <b>shifts</b> and strength <b>lost</b> due to fatigue. NPDs had longer times to fatigue than PDs (NPDs: 20. 1 ± 11. 2 minutes; PDs: 18. 7 ± 9. 3 minutes; p = 0. 0106). 	This study provides evidence that the hip abductor musculature is likely one causative factor in the low back pain developed from standing. Also, PDs had fatiguing characteristics of persons suffering from chronic low back pain, only without any pain present...|$|R
