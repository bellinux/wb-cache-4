40|$|This study {{identifies}} three {{real option}} motivations for {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI) : Product-related growth options, industry-related growth options, and market-related flexibility options. This study further posits that the real option benefits are better realized by service MNEs, which are less encumbered operationally by hysteresis than manufacturer MNEs. For 235 cross-border acquisitions announced by U. S. MNEs during 1999 and 2000, on average, abnormal returns (ARs) around announcements are positive and are greater for service MNEs than manufacturers. The <b>soft</b> <b>service</b> MNE median return is significantly greater than the manufacturer MNE median AR, and that of basic, electronics and instruments, and consumer products manufacturing firms. The regression results suggest that flexibility options and industry related growth options have a predicted, positive effect on shareholder value for the total sample and especially for service firms which are less subject to the muting effects of hysteresis. Product related acquisitions have an unpredicted, negative effect on shareholder value probably because the “liability of foreignness ” offsets the real option benefits provided by new products...|$|R

Firstly, within the case company there was multiple formal networks that circulate separately, except for interconnections through the restaurant managers. Within the organization personal relationships proved to be the most important factor for knowledge sharing. Secondly, within a large franchise network, an actor might take the role of knowledge creator due to its size and influence the other franchises in the network. Thirdly, knowledge transfer, implementation and innovation are hindered when work environment is characterized by stress and high pressure to perform. Fourthly, communication improves operation efficiency and employee motivation.

40|$|Public private {{partnerships}} (PPP) are {{an established}} model for most governments internationally to provide infrastructure-based services, using private finance. Typically the public authority will {{sign a contract}} with a special purpose vehicle (SPV), which, because of the holistic nature of PPP, in turn sub-contracts the finance, design, construction, maintenance and <b>soft</b> <b>services</b> to companies that are often related to its shareholders. Thus there is a considerable network of linked organisations that together procure and provide the PPP project. While there is an increasing body of research that examines these PPP projects, {{much of it is}} interview or case study based so that the evidence is drawn from a small number of interviews or cases in specific sectors.

The article is based on a survey of 190 municipalities in Sweden, and their adoption and use of the BSC. The empirical findings not only demonstrate that there has occurred a diffusion of the BSC among Swedish municipalities but also that the diffusion process in large follows a S-shaped pattern.

40|$|Building Information Modelling (BIM) is {{changing}} the way the construction industry works and whilst designers and constructors are already rapidly implementing BIM in their practices, its potential use for facilities management is still not clearly identified and existing case studies show only a marginal use. The research {{presented in this paper}} aims to identify the opportunities and barriers related to the integration of BIM and Facility Management (FM) knowledge. It investigates how FM and BIM can add value to and improve the transition process from construction to operation by capturing and making better use of relevant FM information. A focus group workshop approach was used with a group of subject matter experts (SME) from across the building whole life process. The workshop was the first step of a three-year project aimed at understanding how BIM can support sustainable FM decisions. BIM offers FM an opportunity as a process tool to enable a more informed decision-making process. The paper summarizes the theoretical applications of BIM to FM and presents the outcomes of the workshop. FM can use BIM as a unique source of data that needs to be transformed into usable information for day-by-day activities.

40|$|Purpose : The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{explanatory}} power of internationalisation theory for service firms internationalising into China. Design/Methodology/Approach : Interviews were conducted with Australian based 23 service businesses that had entered China. Internationalisation theory was examined in this research. A number of constructs were investigated, which included the type of <b>service</b> (hard or <b>soft),</b> internationalisation motivation/pathways, previous international experience and whether companies plan or not. A number of propositions were tested in relation to these constructs. Findings : The research found that <b>soft</b> <b>services</b> were more likely to choose full control modes, and hard services choose lower control modes. The most common motivation for entering China was to seek markets there, and these resulted in lower involvement modes. There was no relationship found between having international experience and entry mode, and it was found that businesses with low levels of planning still engaged high control modes. Internationalisation theory was partially supported in the research and was found to correctly predict the progression of equity in Chinese businesses owned by Australian companies. Research Limitations/Implications : The limitation of the research was the small sample size, and future research should consider the constructs over a larger sample. Practical Implications : The implications for other Australian service businesses is they should consider the type of service they have (hard or soft), and then make appropriate entry mode choices. Originality/Value : There is limited research on the internationalisation of service businesses, and no other research has examined Australian service providers going to China. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Both public {{authorities}} and private companies increasingly outsource {{facilities management services}} to external suppliers. A new service industry with its own culture and contracting practices is developing. This study discusses factors that influence trust and relationship culture in the Swedish FM sector. A multilevel perspective is taken, so that processes on institutional and market levels are discussed in relation to contract principles and management as well as interpersonal relations. The study {{is based on a}} review of FM literature and interviews with leading clients, consultants and service providers. The findings are analysed using general theories on sources of trust and the relationship between trust and contract. A general background on the development of FM is included, and the empirical section outlines views on trends, market structure, contract models, procurement, contract relationships and management, differences between clients, etc. The discussion focuses more specifically on trust issues. It is concluded that while industry level efforts to develop standard contract and create trust in contracting out FM services have been successful, contracting practice is slower to harmonize because of the influx of first time clients. Although there {{does not seem to be}} a straightforward relation between contract design and relationship quality, it was found that detailed service specifications and active monitoring may support both learning and trust since they entail mutual understanding and focused discussions. Less extensive contracts may, paradoxically, result in less innovation because of lower client and supplier engagement. This risk is higher when FM services are perceived as support services compared to when they are seen as strategic service relations. Further, it is concluded that since relational trust develops between client employees and supplier employees who interact closely, services need different kinds of management depending on the interaction patterns they entail. Typically, low level interaction relations such as technical property services may need a focus on fostering trust, while <b>soft</b> <b>services</b> call for formalization and distance...|$|R

The study firstly included defining FM, its scope and nature to provide an in-depth overview and understanding of the discipline. Secondly, the study discussed in detail the level of support of FM by top or senior management. Thirdly, the study discussed the importance of quality management in enhancing the value of FM within an organisation. Lastly, the study discussed how service level agreements can be utilised to enhance the value of FM within the organisation. Questionnaires were distributed via electronic mail and some hand-delivered to private, public organisations and government parastatals to gather their views on how they think FM can add value to their organisations. Questionnaires were sent out to various professionals from various organisations that employ FM services based on the aforementioned objectives. The findings from the survey showed that most organisations understand and have the knowledge about FM but there is no set and defined scope; the scope of FM differs in various organisations; <b>soft</b> <b>services</b> are grouped together and branded as FM services; FM is moderately incorporated throughout and top management still sees FM as adding no value to the organisation’s core business. The results also show that FM needs to adopt strategies such as understanding and working towards the organisation’s goals and objectives; ensuring sustainability in FM services; providing superior quality service and projecting defined and improved levels of service linking service to the organisation’s culture and facilitating organisational change for it to gain support from top management. The majority of respondents incorporating FM in their organisations agree with the benefits afforded by this discipline and have developed and implemented quality management systems that are linked to their business strategies and, by doing so, have enhanced their organisation’s performance levels.
