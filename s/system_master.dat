In Elysium, Mega Man reaches {{the room where the}} Carbon Reinitialization Program is to be {{executed}} from. Sera then appears {{in the form of a}} robot to Mega Man and states that she did not execute the Carbon Reinitialization Program but has, instead, been waiting for Mega Man's arrival to challenge him in hopes that by defeating him she would prove that their master liked her more. In battle, Gatz tries to aid Mega Man by attacking Sera's logic circuits, but dies in the attempt. As Mega Man defeats Sera, Yuna arrives at the scene reminding Sera that it is not their Master's wish for her to die. Sera awakes in Yuna's real body and decides to help Yuna protect the Carbons from the machines that are being activated in Terra due to an old <b>system</b> <b>Master</b> tried to stop. However, due to Gatz's death, Mega Man, Sera and Yuna are now stranded in Elysium with no means of transporting back to Terra any time soon. The game ends with Roll and other characters working together to build a rocket to rescue Mega Man from Elysium.|$|E

The developers retouched and redrew the graphics and added additional sound effects taken from military training videos. Conversions for other systems include the Atari Lynx, Super Nintendo Entertainment <b>System,</b> <b>Master</b> System, Game Gear and Game Boy. The game was also ported to the Game Boy Advance, ten years later in 2002, as Desert Strike Advance, and was re-released in 2006 for the PlayStation Portable as part of a budget compilation.|$|E

40|$|The {{expansion}} {{and maintenance of}} building systems on educational campuses require huge financial expenditures. Public schools and colleges must {{make the most of}} each available dollar. The combination of effective building <b>systems</b> <b>master</b> planning and purchasing standardization program management (PSPM) maximizes purchasing power. Proper building <b>systems</b> <b>master</b> planning helps owners get what they want from buildings with greater opportunity for success. Master planning yields benefits in budgeting, staffing, equipment, and opportunities for standardization. PSPM is a strategy utilizing the ?buy now-pay later? concept. Equipment is pre-selected and prepriced for projects as outlined in building <b>systems</b> <b>master</b> plans, and, frequently, in bond programs. Bulk purchasing and standardization, while normally thought of in reference to office and cleaning supplies, can also be applied to big-ticket items. The result is reduced first costs and a domino effect of other savings. Case studies will be presented from Texas school districts that demonstrate successful building <b>systems</b> <b>master</b> planning and PSPM programs. The authors' experience in assisting Texas ISDs implement these programs will also be shared...|$|R

30|$|It is {{well known}} that most of the {{synchronization}} methods of chaotic systems are of the master-slave (drive-response) type. The system, which is called a slave system or a response system, can be driven by another system, which is called a <b>master</b> <b>system</b> or drive system, so that the behavior of the slave system can be influenced by the <b>master</b> <b>system,</b> i.e., the <b>master</b> <b>system</b> is independent to the slave system but the slave system is driven by the <b>master</b> <b>system.</b> In this paper, our aim is to design the controller reasonably such that the behavior of the slave system synchronizes to that of the <b>master</b> <b>system.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Contrary to its {{performance}} in Japan and North America, the <b>Master</b> <b>System</b> was eventually {{a success in}} Europe, where it outsold the NES by a considerable margin.

[...] Combined with the Mega Drive, Sega represented the majority of the console user base in Europe that year.
