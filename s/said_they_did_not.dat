5|$|From the outset, {{the team}} {{wanted to make}} a grand RPG, but were {{restricted}} by their budget and schedule. They were reluctant to cut any content such as one of the time periods or the multiplayer aspect, and they decided to postpone the original release date from March 2000 to June the same year. They also scaled back the scope of their multiplayer testing and canceled the planned release of an interactive pre-launch demo. The delay allowed Nihilistic to retain most of the intended design but they were forced to remove the ability to play the entire single-player campaign as a team online, compensating for this by adding two multiplayer scenarios built using levels from the single-player game. Huebner <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> plan appropriately for multiplayer when building the Java scripts for the single-player game, meaning the scripts did not work effectively in multiplayer mode.|$|E
5|$|The {{graphic design}} {{was decided to}} be {{modelled}} from those of cartoons, and a goal was to have two thousand character animations. Another artist was hired to complete the graphics on time, and the team ultimately ended up with four. Fellow artist Andy Bass had difficulty getting the Kit-Kat graphics correct. He <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> have the right colour, so Carr tweaked the palette. Bass modelled the vending machine that would use the Kit-Kat graphics and used 3D Studio to render it into the game palette, which he then edited using Deluxe Paint. By spring 1996, around half of the illnesses and animations were complete, the introduction and cutscenes were mostly complete, and the programming of the management system was almost finished. By early 1997, {{all that was left}} was refining the difficulty levels.|$|E

5|$|Xenosaga Episode I was {{the debut}} game title of Japanese {{developer}} Monolith Soft. Company founder Tetsuya Takahashi acted as director and co-writer. Takahashi had previously worked at Square on the PlayStation RPG Xenogears. Initially planned as a six-part series and despite there being concept {{work for a}} sequel, Xenogears was left as a standalone project while Square decided to focus on their established franchises such as Final Fantasy. Another stated reason was that Square <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> have the money available to invest in his concept. Following his departure from Square due to disagreeing with their strategy, Takahashi searched for another company which could help him create the game he and others from the Xenogears project envisioned. According to producer Hirohide Sugiura, most of the companies they contacted suggested forming Monolith Soft as an independent developer, with only Namco suggesting that they become a subsidiary, and was willing to both fund the production and manage the logistics and marketing, allowing Monolith Soft staff to focus solely on creating the game. Following this agreement, Namco helped {{in the development and}} marketing of the game. While production of the game began following the foundation of Monolith Soft in 2000, Takahashi had been working on the game's concept since 1999, intending it as a spiritual successor to Xenogears rather than a remake or sequel. Production at Monolith Soft took two years. The development budget apparently reached ¥1 billion—approximately $7,700,000 USD.|$|E

5000|$|In 2010, FMC {{conducted}} a follow-up survey {{which found that}} [...] "of the 1,451 respondents, 33 percent <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> have health insurance."

50|$|Outside the courthouse, Cheung {{catches up}} with Sandy to express his {{gratitude}} to her, and Sandy <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> fit together, and claims she only did that just to not let him go to jail and tells him to {{take good care of}} Ruby and Tai-hung. As they separate, Cheung was unexpectedly killed by Uncle Mei's henchmen on the streets.|$|R
25|$|On 16 June 2017, police <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> {{believe they}} would find more survivors. It was likely that some victims would never be {{identified}} due to {{the intensity of the}} fire, and the final death toll might exceed 100. Many bodies still remained in the tower. Twenty-four people remained in hospital, with 12 in critical care.|$|E
25|$|In {{the days}} after the fire, there were {{considerable}} efforts to assign and avoid blame {{on the part of the}} band, the nightclub owners, the manufacturers and distributors of the foam material and pyrotechnics, and the concert promoters. Through attorneys, club owners <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> give permission to the band to use pyrotechnics. Band members claimed they had permission.|$|E
25|$|Following his announcement, Rasmussen Reports had Barr polling at 6% {{nationwide}} against Barack Obama (42%), John McCain (38%), and Ralph Nader (4%). The study identified Barr as the Libertarian candidate, {{but most}} voters <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> {{know enough about}} him to have an opinion of him personally. Barr's support in the poll was a net drain on Republicans; he picked up 7% of the Republican vote, 5% of the Democratic vote, and 5% of the unaffiliated vote.|$|E

The McMahons claimed that after they signed the power of attorney forms, McNulty began trading at a faster pace. The account statements they received in the mail showed at least three trades a day, sometimes as many as 50 a week. Most were in high-risk options, and the McMahons <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> have sufficient financial sophistication {{to make sense of what}} was occurring.

25|$|Whitehead's work {{remained}} mostly {{unknown to}} the public and aeronautical community after 1911 until a 1935 article in Popular Aviation magazine co-authored by educator and journalist Stella Randolph and aviation history buff Harvey Phillips. Randolph expanded the article into a book, Lost Flights of Gustave Whitehead, published in 1937. Randolph sought out people who had known Whitehead and had seen his flying machines and engines. She obtained 16 affidavits from 14 people and included the text of their statements in the book. Four people <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> see flights, while the others said they saw flights of various types, ranging from a few dozen to hundreds of feet, to more than a mile.|$|E
25|$|During a DJ {{tour for}} the release of the French group Justice's A Cross the Universe in November 2008, {{controversy}} arose when a photograph of Augé DJing with an unplugged Akai MPD24 surfaced. The photograph sparked accusations that Justice's live sets were faked. Augé has since said that the equipment was unplugged very briefly before being reattached and the band put a three-photo set of the incident on their MySpace page. After a 2013 Disclosure concert, the duo was criticized for pretending to live mix to a playback of a pre-recorded track. Disclosure's Guy Lawrence <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> deliberately intend to mislead their audience, and cited miming by other DJs such as David Guetta.|$|E
50|$|The {{company also}} sold Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) through their American Wind program. A 2014 report by {{environmental}} watchdog group EcoRI {{said that the}} company <b>did</b> <b>not</b> specify if these certificates were from the older class of RECs, or from the substantially more expensive and efficient newer class. North American Power said that the RECs were certified by ISO New England, although that organization <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> certify RECs.|$|R

25|$|The trial {{took place}} in late January and early February 1943; Flynn's attorney, Jerry Giesler, impugned the accusers' {{character}} and morals, and accused them of numerous indiscretions, including affairs with married men and, in Satterlee's case, an abortion (which was illegal at the time). He noted that the two women, who <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> know each other, filed their complaints within days of each other, although the episodes allegedly took place {{more than a year}} apart. He implied that the women had cooperated with prosecutors in hopes of avoiding prosecution themselves. Flynn was acquitted, but the trial's widespread coverage and lurid overtones permanently damaged his carefully cultivated screen image as an idealised romantic leading player.|$|E
25|$|A 2014 poll {{commissioned}} by the US Spanish-language network Univision of more than 2,000 Catholics in 12 countries (Uganda, Spain, the US, Brazil, Argentina, France, Mexico, Italy, Colombia, Poland, the Philippines, and the DRC) found that two thirds of respondents were opposed {{to the idea of}} civil same-sex marriage, and around one third was in favor. However, the level of resistance varied between economically developing and developed countries, with 99% of respondents opposed in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo; but a majority in favour in Spain (63%) and the US (54%). Additionally, in all countries a majority of those polled <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> think the Catholic Church should perform marriages between two people of the same sex—although the results again ranged with support strongest in Spain (43% in favour) to Uganda (99% against).|$|E
25|$|Also on September 10, DNI Mike McConnell {{testified before}} the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs that the Protect America Act had helped foil a major terror plot in Germany. U.S. intelligence-community {{officials}} questioned the accuracy of McConnell's testimony and urged his office to correct it, which he did in a statement issued September 12, 2007. Critics cited the incident {{as an example of}} the Bush administration's exaggerated claims and contradictory statements about surveillance activities. Counterterrorism officials familiar with the background of McConnell's testimony <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> believe he made inaccurate statements intentionally as part of any strategy by the administration to persuade Congress to make the new eavesdropping law permanent. Those officials said they believed McConnell gave the wrong answer because he was overwhelmed with information and merely mixed up his facts.|$|E

25|$|With the {{eventual}} outcome {{in terms of}} both votes and seats varying substantially from the bulk of opinion polls released in the final months before the election, the polling industry received criticism for their inability to predict what was a surprisingly clear Conservative victory. Several theories have been put forward to explain the inaccuracy of the pollsters. One theory was that there had simply been a very late swing to the Conservatives, with the polling company Survation claiming that 13% of voters made up their minds in the final days and 17% {{on the day of the}} election. The company also claimed that a poll they carried out a day before the election gave the Conservatives 37% and Labour 31%, though they <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> release the poll (commissioned by the Daily Mirror) on the concern that it was too much of an outlier with other poll results.|$|E
25|$|It {{was around}} this time that the project was joined by both the US Coast Guard and the Royal Canadian Navy. The project was still top secret at this time, and little actual {{information}} was shared, especially with the Coast Guard. The Canadian liaison was required, as ideal siting for the stations would require several stations in various locations in the Canadian Maritime Provinces. One site in Nova Scotia {{proved to be a}} battle; the site was owned by a fisherman whose domineering teetotaler wife was dead set against having {{anything to do with the}} sinful Navy men. When the site selection committee of J.A. Waldschmitt and Lt. Cdmr. Argyle were discussing the matter with the husband, a third visitor arrived and he offered the men cigarettes. They refused, and the hostess then asked if they drank. When they <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not,</b> the land was quickly secured.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, two {{newspapers}} in New Zealand decided to republish controversial Danish cartoons depicting Muhammad, the prophet of Islam. The Muslim community registered their displeasure through press statements {{and a small}} peaceful march in Auckland. The editors <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> mean offence but would not back down. Prime Minister Helen Clark and opposition leader Don Brash both made statements that the cartoons were not appreciated if they deeply offended members of the New Zealand community, but that such decisions were for editors to make, not politicians. Muslim leaders and the editors got together with the Race Relations office, and Jewish and Christian representatives in Wellington. As {{a result of this}} meeting the editors said they would not apologise but in good faith would refrain from publishing the offending images again. The New Zealand Muslim leadership, through the Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand (FIAN]Z, then proceeded in good faith to consider the matter closed, and drafted letters to 52 Muslim countries reversing their earlier stance and asking that New Zealand products not be boycotted.|$|E
500|$|In May 2011 the National Legal and Policy Center {{announced}} that some Chevrolet dealers were selling Volts to other dealers and claiming the [...] federal {{tax credit for}} themselves.

General Motors acknowledged that 10 dealer-to-dealer Volt sales had taken place among Chevrolet dealers, but the carmaker <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> encourage such practice.|$|R
