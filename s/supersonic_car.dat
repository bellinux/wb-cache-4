His vision was of a <b>supersonic</b> rocket <b>car</b> with a potential maximum speed of 840 mph. Norris Brothers were requested to undertake a design study. Bluebird Mach 1.1 was a design for a rocket-powered supersonic land speed record car.Campbell chose a lucky date to hold a press conference at the Charing Cross Hotel on 7 July 1965 to announce his future record breaking plans: ...|$|R
5000|$|In response, Breedlove {{built an}} FIA-legal four-wheeler, Sonic I, {{powered by a}} 15000 lbf kN J79 turbojet. November 2, 1965, Breedlove entered the FIA record book with a two-run average of 555.483 mph. This lasted even less time than before, for Green Monster came back five days later at 576.553 mph. On November 15, Breedlove responded with a 600.601 mph record (after turning in an amazing 608.201 mph return pass), which held until 1970. (It would be broken by Gary Gabelich's Blue Flame, which reached 630.388 mph.) To take the record back, Breedlove planned a <b>supersonic</b> rocket <b>car,</b> [...] "complete with ejector seat." [...] Also in 1965, Breedlove's wife, Lee Breedlove, took the seat in Sonic 1, making four passes and {{achieving}} 308.506 mph, making her the fastest woman alive, and making them the fastest couple, which they remain. According to author Rachel Kushner, Craig had talked Lee into taking the car out for a record attempt in order to monopolize the salt flats {{for the day and}} block one of his competitors from making a record attempt.|$|R
50|$|In 1969, after Campbell's fatal accident, his widow, Tonia Bern-Campbell {{negotiated}} {{a deal with}} Lynn Garrison, President of Craig Breedlove and Associates, that would see Craig Breedlove run Bluebird on Bonneville's Salt Flats. This concept was cancelled when the parallel Spirit of America <b>supersonic</b> <b>car</b> project failed to find support.|$|E
50|$|CN7 was {{eventually}} restored in 1969, but has never fully run again.

50|$|Swansea {{academics}} in {{the area}} of Computational Fluid Dynamics and Aerodynamic Design are part of the Bloodhound <b>Supersonic</b> <b>Car</b> land-speed world record attempt which is due to take place in Hakskeenpan, South Africa in October 2016. The university was also a key partner in the successful Thrust SSC and-speed record attempt which currently holds the world land-speed record.|$|E
50|$|Thrust2, the record-breaking car {{driven by}} Noble, {{travelled}} at 633.468 mph (1019 km/h). The accomplishment won Noble the 1983 Segrave Trophy. ThrustSSC, the <b>supersonic</b> <b>car</b> driven by Andy Green, broke the record at 763.035 mph (1221 km/h) or Mach 1.02. Noble is planning another land speed record {{attempt to take}} place in 2016: Bloodhound SSC aims to pass the 1,000 mph mark.|$|E
5000|$|The Bullet Project, in {{comparison}} to Australian, British, and American teams which all have vehicles now in the build or testing phase 44 feet in length or longer and weighing six tons or more, is taking a radically different approach {{to the problem of}} building a <b>supersonic</b> <b>car.</b> The target dry weight of RV-1 is three tons with a rocket propellant capacity of approximately two tons.|$|E
50|$|In August 2011 the UK {{government}} {{announced that the}} airport's bid to host an enterprise zone for aerospace businesses had been successful. The Aerohub enterprise zone was launched in April 2012. In September 2014, the UK's Homes and Communities Agency and the European Regional Development Fund agreed to fund {{the construction of a}} £6 million Aerohub Business Park. Organisations attracted to Aerohub by 2014 included Classic Air Force and the Bloodhound <b>Supersonic</b> <b>Car</b> project.|$|E
50|$|During 1968, Lynn Garrison, President of Craig Breedlove & Associates {{started to}} package {{a deal that}} saw Utah's Governor, Calvin Rampton provide a hangar {{facility}} {{for the construction of}} a <b>supersonic</b> <b>car.</b> Bill Lear, of Learjet fame, was to provide support, along with his friend Art Linkletter. Playboy magazine hoped to have the car painted black, with a white bunny on the rudder. TRW was supplying a lunar lander rocket motor. A change in public interest saw the concept shelved for a period of time.|$|E
50|$|Concordia University's Engineering and Computer Science Association (ECA) has erected {{models of}} a space shuttle, the Sears Tower, the Eiffel Tower, Habitat 67, and mazes out of K'Nex. The U.S. Space and Rocket Center held a Guinness Book of World Records Award for the “World’s Largest K'Nex Sculpture” and also has a huge space shuttle and rocket in their gift shop in Huntsville, Alabama. The Guinness World Record for “World’s Largest K'Nex Sculpture” was broken in 2014 by a team in the UK with a 13.38 meter long K'Nex replica of the BLOODHOUND 1000 mph <b>Supersonic</b> <b>Car.</b> K'Nex also has a {{traveling}} exhibit, K'Nex: Build Thrill Rides, that visits school and museums across the country.|$|E
50|$|From 1965 through 1969, Garrison was {{president}} of Craig Breedlove & Associates. Breedlove held the World Land Speed Record five times in 1965 with {{a top speed of}} over 601.1 miles per hour.

50|$|Didcot has {{a strong}} {{connection}} with the Williams Grand Prix Engineering team as Frank Williams founded the team there in a former carpet warehouse in 1977. After establishing themselves in Formula One, the factory, now including a small 'Williams Museum', moved within Didcot to a new factory on the Didcot A Power Station site on Basil Hill Road. They stayed there until 1995 when they finally outgrew the site, moving to nearby Grove where they are based today. In 2012 a new road through the new Great Western Park development in Didcot was named Sir Frank Williams Avenue in honour of Williams' contribution to the town.Didcot's link to the automotive industry was revived in 2015 when the head offices of the Bloodhound SSC team were moved to the new University Technical College (UTC) Oxfordshire site on the boundary between Didcot and Harwell. The team are aiming to break the world land speed record with their <b>supersonic</b> <b>car.</b>|$|E
40|$|Additive {{manufacturing}} (‘ 3 D printing’) techniques provide engineers with unprecedented design freedoms, {{opening up}} the possibility for stronger and lighter component designs. In this paper ‘layout optimization’ is used to provide a reference volume and to identify potential design topologies for a given component, providing a useful alternative to continuum based topology optimization approaches (which normally require labour intensive post-processing in order to realise a practical component). Here simple rules are used to automatically transform a line structure layout into a 3 D continuum. Two examples are considered: (i) a simple beam component subject to three-point bending; (ii) a more complex air-brake hinge component, designed for the Bloodhound <b>supersonic</b> <b>car.</b> These components were successfully additively manufactured using titanium Ti- 6 Al- 4 V, using the Electron Beam Melting (EBM) process. Also, to verify {{the efficacy of the}} process and the mechanical performance of the fabricated specimens, a total of 12 beam samples were load tested to failure, demonstrating that the target design load could successfully be met...|$|E
