5|$|In {{the case}} of Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), the Court of Appeal {{expanded}} the scope of judicial review by adopting an objective test when reviewing the exercise of executive discretion. In contrast to the subjective test, the objective test permits the court to examine whether the decision-maker's <b>satisfaction</b> <b>was</b> based on objective facts which fell {{within the scope of}} the purposes specified by the ISA. The subjective satisfaction or mere ipse dixit of the executive body is insufficient. However, the adoption of this objective test was only part of the obiter dicta of the case. The ratio decidendi of the case was based on narrower technical grounds.|$|E

Physical relationships between women were often encouraged; men felt no threat as they viewed sexual acts between women to be accepted when men were not available, and not comparable to fulfillment that could be achieved by sexual acts between men and women. At worst, if a woman became enamored of another woman, she became a tragic figure. Physical and therefore emotional <b>satisfaction</b> <b>was</b> considered impossible without a natural phallus. Male intervention into relationships between women was necessary only when women acted as men and demanded the same social privileges.|$|E

Out of 5,319 customers contacted in a stratisfied sample, 2,731 responded. Customer care received the highest rating, while water quality and pressure received lower, but overall good, ratings.

25|$|There are {{a number}} of domains that are thought to {{contribute}} to subjective well-being. In a study by Hribernik and Mussap (2010), leisure <b>satisfaction</b> <b>was</b> found to predict unique variance in life satisfaction, supporting its inclusion as a distinct life domain contributing to subjective well-being. Additionally, relationship status interacted with age group and gender on differences in leisure satisfaction. The relationship between leisure satisfaction and life satisfaction, however, was reduced when considering the impact of core affect (underlying mood state). This suggests that leisure satisfaction may primarily be influenced by an individual's subjective well-being level as represented by core affect. This has implications for possible limitations in the extent to which leisure satisfaction may be improved beyond pre-existing levels of well-being and mood in individuals.|$|E
25|$|Different implant {{manufacturers}} require {{slightly different}} instrumentation and technique. No consensus has emerged over {{which one is}} the best. Clinical studies {{are very difficult to}} perform, requiring large numbers of cases followed over many years. The most significant variations are between cemented and uncemented components and between resurfacing the patella or not. Among those who do not resurface the patella, there is also variation between denervating the patella using electrocautery or not. In theory, this technique could disrupt the superficial pain receptors near the patella in hopes of relieving anterior knee pain, a common post-operative complaint. No consensus exists, but a recent randomized controlled trial indicates that while both methods provide relief, patellar denervation results in a modest benefit compared to no denervation in the short-term. The patient <b>satisfaction</b> <b>was</b> higher with more number of patients rating the procedure as excellent in the denervation group (74.6% vs 50.8%). The benefit does not, however, persist mid- to long-term post-operatively.
