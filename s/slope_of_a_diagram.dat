50|$|<b>As</b> <b>a</b> {{generalization}} <b>of</b> this practical description, {{the mathematics}} of differential calculus defines the <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> curve {{at a point}} as the <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> the tangent line at that point. When the curve is given by <b>a</b> series <b>of</b> points in <b>a</b> <b>diagram</b> or in <b>a</b> list <b>of</b> the coordinates <b>of</b> points, the <b>slope</b> may be calculated not at a point but between any two given points. When the curve is given as a continuous function, perhaps as an algebraic formula, then the differential calculus provides rules giving a formula for the <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> the curve {{at any point in}} the middle of the curve.|$|R
