25|$|Ebony {{tries to}} make a deal with the Technos' general, Jay, in order to hold a little power in the city. Ellie, blaming Ebony for Jack's capture, {{attempts}} to kill her and is sent away to a labour camp. The Technos <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> bring progress and order to the city. However, in secret, their leader, Ram, is experimenting a new virtual game on people with the help of Jay's brother, Ved. Ved starts a relationship with Mall Rat Cloe but when she tells him she is pregnant, he immediately dumps her. Amber becomes unwillingly addicted to the game and realises the Technos must be stopped. She asks an initially reluctant Cloe to get information from Ved, but Cloe later agrees, getting Ved drunk and taking advantage of him by receiving the password for his computer. Ebony reluctantly agrees to marry Ram, but ends up betraying him and escapes the city with Jay, who has come to realise what Ram's real plans are. Cloe becomes addicted to reality space and whilst playing the game, vanishes. Ved is distraught as he actually loved her. He fights Ram in reality space to get her back but loses and is later deleted. The Mall Rats succeed in defeating Ram by imprisoning him in virtual reality, with the help of Ram's lieutenant, Mega.|$|E
500|$|When an {{interviewer}} commented that Anarky was popular among fans in 2003, {{in the midst}} of the character's period of obscurity, Norm Breyfogle offered a caveat: [...] "Well, in certain segments of the comic book industry, I suppose." [...] Breyfogle continued, [...] "It has some diehard fans. But, DC doesn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do anything with him. Maybe it's because of his anti-authoritarian philosophy, a very touchy subject in today's world." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Death" [...] {{was written}} and {{directed}} by series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. The episode, along with the Terrance and Phillip show, were inspired by early criticism that South Park was little more than flatulence jokes and primitive animation. The script portrays the parents as so invested in protesting television programs, they fail to pay any attention to what is actually going on in their children's lives. They <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> make television clean and wholesome so the entertainment industry can raise their kids so they themselves don't have to make the time and effort to be full-time parents. The episode also advocates against censorship and addresses the morality and ethics of euthanasia.|$|E

He <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do away with a good many things, but he <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> remain himself. I suppose that's natural, but it's rather inconsistent." ...|$|R

2500|$|The narrator {{wants to}} learn more about this heroic man. He finds that people do not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> speak about the General when asked, only commenting on {{achievements}} of the [...] "wonderfully inventive age" [...] and how [...] "horrid" [...] the Native Americans whom the General had fought against had been. The narrator begins to believe there is some concealed secret he must uncover.|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{point out}} that this theory fails to explain when, how, why or by whom [...] "obligatory {{reciprocal}} altruism" [...] could possibly have been enforced. Various proposals have been offered to remedy this defect. A further criticism is that language doesn't work on the basis of reciprocal altruism anyway. Humans in conversational groups don't withhold information to all except listeners likely to offer valuable information in return. On the contrary, they <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> advertise to the world their access to socially relevant information, broadcasting it to anyone who will listen without thought of return.|$|E
2500|$|The first anchor {{store to}} close at Regency Mall was Upton’s, which {{occupied}} the space originally built for Cullum's; its Regency Mall store closed in April 1993. [...] Seven other stores in the mall closed {{by the end of}} that year. [...] Some merchants who were leaving the mall said that the mall wasn’t generating enough traffic to justify remaining at the mall. [...] One said she didn’t see the mall “having any kind of future” the way it was. [...] Another merchant claimed that the mall’s management “doesn’t <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> work with its tenants.” [...] Though some new businesses moved in, some of these were small businesses instead of franchised outlets; for example, a comic book store moved into a vacant store on the second level. [...] However, the mall was steadily becoming deserted.|$|E

2500|$|During the Test, former South African opening batsman Barry Richards bemoaned {{the lack}} of fight in the England team, commenting that [...] "...it puzzles me why {{the new breed of}} England batsmen are failing to stamp their {{authority}} on an innings. People like Stewart and Hick have all the ability at Test level but they do not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> grab the game by the scruff of its [...] neck and say to the opposition bowlers: 'I'm here. Come and get me if you can.'". [...] meanwhile, in The Guardian, Mike Selvey praised the South African seamers, and Scyld Berry singled out Fanie De Villiers' bowling on the second day as the turning point of the match, and the above commentators pointed out England's lack of success at the home of cricket and questioned {{the lack of}} a left-handed batsman in the eleven.|$|E
2500|$|... "There {{is almost}} nothing, except for maybe a {{cigarette}} ad, I'd {{say no to}} 'Under the Milky Way' being used for [...] It was used for a car advertisement in America, very lucratively for me. You'd think people would think it's been overused, but the more it's used the more people <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> use it. I'm signing off all the time for TV shows or chocolate bars using it. Sure, have it, it's just a song, do whatever you like with it. You can hear it wasn't written for profit. It's an accidental song I accidentally wrote and accidentally became a single and accidentally became a hit. It's been a nice earner [...] I've written 2000 songs. Thank God one of them came through! [...] The others aren't pulling their weight. They sit and grumble about 'Under the Milky Way' and I say, 'Well, boys, go out and earn the same dough as that one'. I never see 'Under the Milky Way' – it's so busy out there working..." ...|$|E
2500|$|The film had {{its opening}} premiere on March 2, 1965 at the Rivoli Theater in New York City. Initial reviews were mixed. Bosley Crowther, in The New York Times, criticized the film's [...] "romantic {{nonsense}} and sentiment", the children's [...] "artificial roles", and Robert Wise's [...] "cosy-cum-corny" [...] direction. Judith Crist, in a biting {{review in the}} New York Herald Tribune, dismissed the movie as [...] "icky sticky" [...] and designed for [...] "the five to seven set and their mommies". In her review for McCall's magazine, Pauline Kael called the film [...] "the sugar-coated lie people <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> eat", and that audiences have [...] "turned into emotional and aesthetic imbeciles when we hear ourselves humming the sickly, goody-goody songs". [...] Wise later recalled, [...] "The East Coast, intellectual papers and magazines destroyed us, but the local papers and the trades gave us great reviews." [...] Indeed, reviewers such as Philip K. Scheuer of the Los Angeles Times described the film as [...] "three hours of visual and vocal brilliance", and Daily Variety called it [...] "a warmly-pulsating, captivating drama set to the most imaginative use of the lilting R-H tunes, magnificently mounted and with a brilliant cast". The [...] "wildly mixed film reviews" [...] reflected the critical response to the stage musical, according to The Oxford Companion to the American Musical. After its Los Angeles premiere on March 10, The Sound of Music opened in 131 theaters in the United States, including {{a limited number of}} roadshow events. After four weeks, the film became the number one box office movie in the country, and held that position for thirty out of the next forty-three weeks in 1965. The original theatrical release of the film in America lasted four and a half years.|$|E
