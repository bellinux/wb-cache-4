The mixed solution of hexane/ethanol/trimethylchlorosilane was used to modify the sol-gel derived silica aqueous gel so as to obtain porous structure by ambient pressure drying.

25|$|Aerogels {{are good}} thermal {{insulators}} because they almost nullify 2 {{of the three}} methods of heat transfer – conduction (they are mostly composed of insulating gas) and convection (the microstructure prevents net gas movement). They are good conductive insulators because they are composed almost entirely of gases, which are very poor heat conductors. (<b>Silica</b> <b>aerogel</b> is an especially good insulator because silica is also a poor conductor of heat; a metallic or carbon aerogel, on the other hand, would be less effective.) They are good convective inhibitors because air cannot circulate through the lattice. Aerogels are poor radiative insulators because infrared radiation (which transfers heat) passes through them.|$|E

40|$|Reported <b>silica</b> <b>aerogels</b> have {{a thermal}} {{conductivity}} {{as low as}} 15 mW/mK. The fragility of <b>silica</b> <b>aerogels,</b> however, makes them impractical for structural applications. The {{purpose of the study}} is to improve the ductility of aerogels while retain the low thermal conductivity of <b>silica</b> <b>aerogels.</b> We have established a new synthesis route, a 3 -step sol-gel processing method. The method provides better control of the formation of aerogel structures. The produced <b>silica</b> <b>aerogels</b> show much improved ductility compared to conventional methods in literatures. Furthermore, the synthesized <b>silica</b> <b>aerogels</b> have thermal conductivities as low as about 9 mW/mK, which is the lowest in all reported solids. The ultra low thermal conductivity can be explained with nano-scale structures for the <b>silica</b> <b>aerogels,</b> which have been characterized using advanced techniques including BET and SEM. We have further investigated and demonstrated the ability of enhancing mechanical properties of <b>silica</b> <b>aerogels</b> through structure modification using the proposed 3 -step sol-gel processing method. The molecular-level synergism between silica particles/clusters and the doped functional materials inverts the relative host-guest roles in the produced aerogel composite, leading to new stronger and more robust low-density materials. by Yanjia Zuo.
