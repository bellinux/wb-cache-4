6000|$|... 'Of course,' {{said the}} Psychologist, and {{reassured}} us. 'That's a simple point of psychology. I {{should have thought}} of it. It's plain enough, and helps the paradox delightfully. We cannot see it, nor can we appreciate this machine, any {{more than we can}} the <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wheel</b> spinning, or a bullet flying through the air. If it is travelling through time fifty times or a hundred times faster than we are, if it gets through a minute while we get through a second, the impression it creates will of course be only one-fiftieth or one-hundredth of what it would make if it were not travelling in time. That's plain enough.' He passed his hand through the space in which the machine had been. 'You see?' he said, laughing.|$|E

[...] ) is passed either before a single pole, or between the opposite poles of a magnet, or near electro-magnetic poles, whether ferruginous or not, electrical currents are produced across the metal transverse to the direction of motion; and which therefore, in Arago's experiments, will approximate towards the direction of radii. If a single wire be moved like the <b>spoke</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wheel</b> near a magnetic pole, a current of electricity is determined through it from one end towards the other. If a wheel be imagined, constructed of {{a great number of}} these radii, and this revolved near the pole, in the manner of the copper disc (85.), each radius will have a current produced in it as it passes by the pole. If the radii be supposed to be in contact laterally, a copper disc results, in which the directions of the currents will be generally the same, being modified only by the coaction which can take place between the particles, now that they are in metallic contact.|$|E

25|$|Cortical {{cataracts}} {{are due to}} {{the lens}} cortex (outer layer) becoming opaque. They occur when changes in the fluid contained in {{the periphery of the}} lens causes fissuring. When these cataracts are viewed through an ophthalmoscope, or other magnification system, the appearance is similar to white <b>spokes</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wheel.</b> Symptoms often include problems with glare and light scatter at night.|$|R

50|$|A Star Promenade is {{an entirely}} {{different}} call but nevertheless part of the family. It consists of four dancers {{in the center of}} the set making a star configuration, with their centermost arms up like the <b>spokes</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wheel,</b> or the ribbons <b>of</b> <b>a</b> maypole. They walk forward counter-clockwise. Their outermost arms are wrapped around a partner’s waist who walks alongside of them.|$|R

Sun Road runs north (traffic south). Hamagin Dōri runs northwest. Chūō Dōri runs out to the west (traffic east). Futsubu Dōri comes in toward the station from the southwest.|$|R
5000|$|The {{radial engine}} is a {{reciprocating}} type {{internal combustion engine}} configuration in which the cylinders point outward from a central crankshaft like the <b>spokes</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wheel.</b> It resembles <b>a</b> stylized star when viewed from the front, and is called a [...] "star engine" [...] (German Sternmotor, French Moteur en étoile) in some languages. The radial configuration was very commonly used in aircraft engines before turbine engines became predominant.|$|R

25|$|San Jose lies {{close to}} the Pacific Ocean and close to San Francisco Bay (<b>a</b> small portion <b>of</b> its {{northern}} border touches the bay). Santa Clara Valley is the population center of the Bay Area and, like the hub and <b>spokes</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wheel,</b> surrounding communities emanate outwards from the valley.

It was also used for the oil filler cap on the Dolomite Sprint engine. However it was never used as a bonnet badge, with models of that era such as the TR6 and the second generation 2000 carrying a badge simply stating the name [...] "Triumph".|$|R
50|$|Five carpels are joined, {{forming the}} <b>spokes</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wheel</b> some 30 cm in diameter. They are woody and densely studded with hard, blunt spines, dehiscing {{on one side}} to reveal large (25 mm long), black seeds, which are rich in oil and, after roasting, are a {{valuable}} food source. Stinging hairs, common in the Malvaceae, coat {{the interior of the}} carpels and these may irritate skin and eyes. The carpels have a superficial resemblance to the Northern Hemisphere Chestnut.|$|R

60|$|If {{the visitor}} be very patient, and lie still, he will {{presently}} hear the pattering of tiny {{feet on the}} leaves, and see the brown birds come running in from every direction. Once in a lifetime, perhaps, he may see them gather in a close circle--tails together, heads out, like the <b>spokes</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wheel,</b> and so go to sleep for the night. Their soft whistlings and chirpings at such times form the most delightful sound one ever hears in the woods.|$|R
60|$|Dorothy {{turned around}} too, and gazed in surprise. There {{were a good}} many roads; more {{than she had ever}} seen before. She tried to count them, knowing there ought to be five; but when she had counted {{seventeen}} she grew bewildered and stopped, for the roads were as many as the <b>spokes</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wheel</b> and ran in every direction from the place where they stood; so if she kept on counting she was likely to count some of the roads twice.|$|R
5000|$|As a {{university}} student Plateau noticed in some early experiments that when looking {{from a small}} distance at two concentric cogwheels which turned fast in opposite directions, <b>an</b> optical illusion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> motionless <b>wheel</b> appeared.

50|$|<b>A</b> total <b>of</b> about 3 billion Japanese Yen (~25.5 million USD) {{was used}} to produce the stages. Well known {{production}} staff also joined the tour, such as Jamie King, the tour director who previously worked with Michael Jackson, Madonna and Britney Spears. Roy Bennett was {{in control of the}} stage lighting, while Veneno took charge of the tour videos. The tour utilized a 30-meter center stage, as well as six 50-meter protruding stages, spreading out from the center stage to the audience like the <b>spokes</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wheel.</b> <b>A</b> large number <b>of</b> stage lighting and equipment was imported from countries outside Japan. High-tech equipment, including the LED screens, were set up on the protruding stages, while the multi-cellular speakers ‘MLA,’ presented high quality concerts for the audience.|$|R
5000|$|The {{city was}} planned with the palace tower (Schloss) {{at the center}} and 32 streets {{radiating}} out from it like the <b>spokes</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wheel,</b> or the ribs <b>of</b> <b>a</b> folding fan, so that one nickname for Karlsruhe in German is the [...] "fan city" [...] (Fächerstadt). Almost all of these streets survived until today. Because of this city layout, in metric geometry, Karlsruhe metric refers to <b>a</b> measure <b>of</b> distance that assumes travel is only possible along radial streets and along circular avenues around the centre.|$|R
5000|$|Intended {{to house}} 220 prisoners, it was {{designed}} by Pierre Finch Martineau Burrows and resembles Dartmoor Prison in England. Its design was based on prevailing thinking {{at the time that}} such facilities should be unpleasant places to be dreaded and consisted <b>of</b> <b>a</b> radial design with wings radiating from the centre like the <b>spokes</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wheel.</b> This allowed for control from the centre and [...] "a new mode of obtaining power of mind over mind", <b>an</b> application <b>of</b> the panopticon prison design theories of Jeremy Bentham.|$|R
500|$|Marasmius rotula is {{commonly}} known as the [...] "pinwheel mushroom", the [...] "pinwheel Marasmius", the [...] "collared parachute", or the [...] "horse hair fungus". This latter name is shared with other Marasmius species, including M.androsaceus and M.crinis-equi. Gray called it the [...] "collared dimple-stool". The name [...] "little wheel fungus" [...] is suggestive of the collar to which the gills are attached like the <b>spokes</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wheel,</b> like the specific epithet, which is <b>a</b> diminutive <b>of</b> rota, the Latin word for [...] "wheel".|$|R
