50|$|Spelling {{dictionaries}} are referencing {{materials that}} specifically aid users {{in finding the}} correct spelling of a word. Unlike common <b>dictionaries,</b> <b>spelling</b> <b>dictionaries</b> do not typically provide definitions and other grammar-related information of the words. While typical dictionaries {{can be used to}} check or search for correct spellings, new and improved <b>spelling</b> <b>dictionaries</b> can assist users in finding the correct spelling of words even when the first alphabet is unknown or incorrect. This circumvents the alphabetic ordering limitations of a classic <b>dictionary.</b> These <b>spelling</b> <b>dictionaries</b> are especially useful to foreign language learners as inclusion of concise definitions and suggestions for commonly confused words help learners to choose the correct spellings of words that sound alike or are pronounced wrongly by them.|$|R

50|$|The Spelling Committee was {{dissolved}} in 1948. From 1953 to 1955, a new committee prepared the first <b>spelling</b> <b>dictionary</b> after the spelling reform of 1948. This dictionary {{was published by}} the then newly established Danish Language Council in 1955 and was titled Retskrivningsordbog (<b>Spelling</b> <b>Dictionary).</b> It was published only as a first version and remained in use until 1986 although it was reprinted many times during its life of 31 years.|$|E

The dictionary was continued by P. K. Thorsen under the name Saabys Retskrivningsordbog (Saaby's <b>Spelling</b> <b>Dictionary).</b> With that title, the fourth edition was published in 1904, the fifth edition in 1909, the sixth edition in 1913, the seventh edition in 1918, and the eighth edition in 1918. The editions complied with the Ministry of Education's communications on spelling from 1889, 1892, 1900 and 1902. The seventh and eighth editions were expressly authorized by the Ministry of Education and contained one of the Ministry's approved spelling guidelines prepared by Henrik Bertelsen.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{examines}} the spelling of scholarly terms from two points of view: {{as part of}} the terminology system and as part of common language. It is shown that multiple objective and subjective causes determine the inevitability of spelling variation in terminology and that all types of deviation from standards concern individual vocables, not rules. Particular attention is given to cases in which specialized terms enter common usage, sometimes leading to changes in their spelling and raising the need for standardization. We analyze previous standards of terminology in general <b>spelling</b> <b>dictionaries,</b> analyze them as part of common language norms and propose possible strategies for standardizing terminology.  </p...|$|R

Matthijs Siegenbeek, professor at Leiden was officially asked in 1801 to draw up a uniform spelling; the priest Petrus Weiland was asked to write a grammar book. A few years later Siegenbeek published his spelling in Verhandeling over de Nederduitsche spelling ter bevordering van de eenparigheid in dezelve (Treatise on Lower Dutch spelling to promote uniformity herein) (1804) and a Woordenboek voor de Nederduitsche <b>spelling</b> (<b>Dictionary</b> for the Dutch Spelling) (1805).

However, many of the proposals from the congress were introduced in the 6th edition of the same dictionary in 1889 (e-ä, qv-kv) and the rest (dt, fv, hv) in a spelling reform for Swedish schools, introduced in 1906 by the minister of education Fridtjuv Berg (1851-1916).

Low tech encompasses equipment that is often low cost and does not include batteries or requires charging.

Mid tech supports used in the school setting include the use of handheld <b>spelling</b> <b>dictionaries</b> and portable word processors used to keyboard writing. High tech supports involve the use of tablet devices and computers with accompanying software. Software supports for writing include the use of auditory feedback while keyboarding, word prediction for spelling, and speech to text. Supports for reading include the use of text to speech (TTS) software and font modification via access to digital text. Limited supports are available for math instruction and mostly consist of grid based software to allow younger students to keyboard equations and auditory feedback of more complex equations using MathML and Daisy.|$|R
