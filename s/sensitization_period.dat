40|$|Orexin plays {{a crucial}} role in drug-seeking behavior. The lateral {{hypothalamus}} (LH) is a cen-tral region that produces orexin, and its projections to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) {{play an important role in}} reward and addiction-related behaviors. In this study, we investigated the role of LH stimulation and the involvement of the orexin- 1 receptor (Ox 1 r) in the VTA in re-lation to morphine sensitization. In all animals, cannulae were implanted unilaterally into the LH and VTA to inject different doses of carbachol (62. 5, 125 and 250 nmol/ 0. 5 μl saline) as a cholinergic agonist and SB 334867 (1, 10 and 20 nmol/ 0. 3 µl DMSO) as a selective Ox 1 r an-tagonist for three consecutive days (<b>sensitization</b> <b>period)</b> respectively. These drugs were in-jected five minutes before administration of an ineffective dose of morphine (0. 5 mg/kg; sc) during the <b>sensitization</b> <b>period.</b> In all groups, the <b>sensitization</b> <b>period</b> occurred in a separate room from which the conditioning occurred. After this period, all groups exceeded five days under the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm without any treatment.

40|$|Background: IL- 6 is {{a unique}} {{cytokine}} that has pro- and anti-inflammatory property. The {{purpose of this study}} was to clarify the role of IL- 6 in the allergic airway inflammation? Methods: We challenged wild-type and IL- 6 -deficient mice with ovalbumin (OVA) inhalation after sensitization to OVA? Results: OVA challenge induced an intrapulmonary eosinophil infiltration and airway hyperresponsiveness in wild-type mice with increased serum IgE levels and enhanced intrapulmonary mRNA expression of T helper type 2 (Th 2) cytokines, IL- 5 and IL- 13. IL- 6 -deficient mice developed a similar level of airway hyperresponsive-ness despite an attenuated eosinophil infiltration and reduced elevation in serum IgE levels after OVA chal-lenge. After OVA challenge, intrapulmonary IL- 5 and IL- 13 mRNA expression was less evident in IL- 6 -deficient mice than wild-type mice, while intrapulmonary IFN-γ mRNA expression was more enhanced. Intravenous ad-ministration of anti-IL- 6 antibodies during <b>sensitization</b> <b>period</b> in wild-type mice caused similar effects as ob-served in IL- 6 deficient mice?

40|$|Rats thymectomized {{at birth}} gained weight and {{otherwise}} developed normally, but {{were found to}} be very susceptible to intercurrent infections. Both Arthus reactivity and delayed hypersensitivity to BSA were markedly impaired in rats thymectomized {{during the first week of}} life and significantly impaired in rats thymectomized as late as 3 weeks after birth. The inhibition of Arthus reactivity in thymectomized rats was well correlated with their failure to develop significant titers of precipitating or hemagglutinating antibody. However, natural heteroagglutinin titers were not altered in these animals, and no abnormality of serum proteins, including γ-globulin could be detected by paper electrophoresis.

Furthermore, animals also received the 5 -HT 3 antagonist ondansetron (0. 2 mg/kg s. c.) either {{during the second}} dosing regimen (3. 5 h after each cocaine/saline injection) or during the first five days of the second withdrawal period. Animals were then challenged, on day 10 of withdrawal, with cocaine (7. 5 mg/kg i. p.) and assessed by a behavioral rating scale and locomotor activity monitoring. The cocaine regimen induced behavioral and locomotor sensitization on day 10 of withdrawal, further, ondansetron inhibited sensitization regardless of whether given after each second cocaine regimen dose or during the second withdrawal period, although treatment 3. 5 h after each cocaine injection appeared more effective. Ondansetron did not inhibit behavior in control animals. In a second experiment animals were trained to self-administer cocaine via an indwelling jugular catheter. After stable fixed-ratio responding (FR 1 then FR 2) {{they were given a}} progressive ratio (PR) schedule until PR each day was stable. During the first five days of withdrawal they were given either ondansetron (0. 2 mg/kg s. c.) or saline injections. On day 10 of withdrawal the cocaine PR schedule was reinstated. The ondansetron treated rats showed only a non-significant decrease in break point. After day 2 of the PR session rats were again injected with either ondansetron (0. 2 mg/kg s. c.) or saline, 3. 5 h after each PR session for five days. Ondansetron inhibited cocaine self-administration on each of the following days.

The JCA group with active inflammation showed significant lower PTs than without detectable inflammation Disease activity and VAS correlated significantly with PT (r = • — 0. 5). There is an enhanced sensitivity to noxious stimuli in all measured body areas, suggesting a change in the pain processing system in JCA.

40|$|Adult immunocompetent mice vaccinated with protein antigens in water-in-oil {{emulsion}} {{so as to}} develop immediate and delayed hypersensitivities resist developing the latter if they are treated with the immunizing antigen in aqueous solution before or during the <b>sensitization</b> <b>period.</b> If the treatments are given during or after vaccination this resistance is directly proportional to their intensity and inversely proportional {{to the degree of}} hypersensitivity which has developed when they are begun. But when the treatments are given before vaccination such split tolerance is more pronounced and seems to be directly proportional more to the degree of humoral antibody production existing at the time of vaccination than to the intensity of treatments. The characteristics of this antigenically specific selective unresponsiveness suggest that it may result from a competitive maturation or differentiation of primitive immunocytes: upon exposure to protein antigens in forms not readily able to induce delayed hypersensitivity, the potential functions of these immunocytes for making circulating antibodies may be pre-empted at the expense of such capacity to develop into cells making the antibody of delayed hypersensitivity...|$|E
40|$|Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) {{infection}} {{has been}} shown to be a risk factor for the development of allergy in humans and mice. The allergy-enhancing properties of RSV may be dependent on atopic background and an individual's history of RSV infection. We examined the influence of the timing of infection and prior inoculation with RSV in a mouse model of allergic asthma. Mice were sensitized to and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA) and were inoculated with RSV either before or during the <b>sensitization</b> or challenge <b>period.</b> One group of mice was inoculated with RSV both before sensitization to OVA and during challenge with OVA. Increased pulmonary expression of interleukin (IL) - 4, IL- 5, and IL- 13 mRNA and aggravated alveolitis and hypertrophy of mucus-producing cells were observed only when OVA-sensitized mice were inoculated with RSV shortly before or during challenge with OVA. Despite protection against viral replication, prior inoculation with RSV did not abrogate RSV-enhanced, OVA-induced expression of T helper 2 (Th 2) cytokines in the lung. In conclusion, inoculation with RSV enhances allergic disease only when the immune system has already been Th 2 -primed by the allergen (i. e., OVA). This RSV-enhanced allergy is not completely abrogated by prior inoculation with RSV...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Early-onset atopic {{dermatitis}} (AD) {{is a particular}} phenotype that may convey a risk of developing multiple sensitizations to allergens but {{little is known about}} the pathway of sensitization. The aims of this study were to describe the natural history of sensitization to allergens for this phenotype and to identify the most predictive marker associated with the risk of developing sensitization to inhaled allergens in a well-selected cohort of infants with AD. METHODS: Infants with active AD were enrolled and prospectively explored for biological markers of atopy every year until the age of 6 yr. Allergic sensitization was defined as the presence of positive specific IgEs to allergens and multiple sensitizations as being sensitized to ≥ 2 allergens. Elevated blood eosinophilia was defined as an eosinophil blood count ≥ 470 eosinophils/mm 3 and elevated total IgE as a serum IgE level ≥ 45 kU/l. RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty-nine infants were included. Elevated blood eosinophilia was observed at baseline in 60 children (26. 2 %) and elevated total IgE in 85 (37. 1 %). When elevated at baseline, eosinophilia and IgE levels remained significantly higher during the follow-up <b>period.</b> <b>Sensitization</b> to food allergens decreased from 58 % to 34 %, whereas sensitization to inhaled allergens increased over time from 17 % to 67 %. Initial multiple sensitizations to food allergens were the most predictive factor for the risk of developing sensitization to inhaled allergens at 6 yr (OR 3. 72 [1. 68 - 8. 30] p < 0. 001).

40|$|The {{effect of}} human {{interferon}} alpha on the differentiation of functional populations of lymphocytes during the human allogeneic response in vitro was studied. Interferon alpha inhibited {{the generation of}} allospecific suppressor T lymphocytes that normally develop from lymphocytes primed in vitro against allogeneic cells. This effect was {{not the result of}} the destruction by interferon of precursor suppressor cells but rather to inhibition of their differentiation into active suppressor T lymphocytes. This inhibition was reversible and could be overcome by repeated allogeneic stimulation even in the presence of interferon. Inhibition of the generation of allospecific suppressor lymphocytes by interferon might {{play an important role in}} the allogeneic response. Interferon inhibited the proliferation of lymphocytes after allogeneic stimulation in a primary mixed lymphocyte reaction but enhanced their cytotoxicity. Despite the inhibitory effect in the primary mixed lymphocyte reaction, the specific secondary proliferative response of lymphocytes primed against a single HLA-DR antigen was only slightly affected by interferon. On the other hand, the nonspecific secondary proliferative response of lymphocytes primed in the presence of interferon was significantly reduced, indicating that interferon might decrease the recruitment of nonspecific "irrelevant" clones of responding cells during the <b>sensitization</b> <b>period...</b>|$|E
40|$|IL- 21 regulates activation, proliferation, and {{differentiation}} of various immune cells. We have previously shown that exogenous IL- 21 administration reduces allergic reactions in mouse models of anaphylaxis and allergic rhinitis. However, {{the effects of}} IL- 21 in allergic cutaneous reactions remain unclear. In this study, we {{examined the effects of}} IL- 21 in a mouse model of the IgE-mediated cutaneous immediate hypersensitivity reaction (IHR). We also investigated the mechanism of IL- 21 -induced regulation of allergic cutaneous reactions. Mice were sensitized by intraperitoneal ovalbumin (OVA) injection and challenged by injecting OVA intradermally into the ears, with intraperitoneal administration of recombinant murine (rm) IL- 21 during the <b>sensitization</b> <b>period</b> or after completion of sensitization. After challenge, IL- 21 -untreated allergic mice developed biphasic responses characterized by early-phase and late-phase reactions. The biphasic reactions were significantly reduced by rmIL- 21 treatment during sensitization or after completion of sensitization. Administration of rmIL- 21 during sensitization reduced the cutaneous IHR by suppressing allergen-specific IgE production. In contrast, administration of rmIL- 21 after completion of sensitization did not decrease serum levels of allergen-specific IgE, but significantly suppressed mast cell degranulation in skin. These results suggest that the regulatory effects of IL- 21 on the cutaneous IHR involve suppression of allergen-specific IgE production or mast cell degranulation...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} case of a patient who {{suffered}} generalized urticaria, chest tightness, wheezing, nausea, vomiting, hypotension, and loss of consciousness. Two hours earlier she had taken Eulitop Retard following lunch. She had tolerated all the implicated food after the reaction. Allergy evaluation revealed intense positive responses to intradermal tests with bezafibrate active component and Eulitop Retard (skin tests in control subjects were negative). Specific IgE tests (RAST) to Eulitop Retard were negative. An IgE mechanism is suggested to be responsible for this adverse reaction {{on the basis of the}} positive skin tets. The delayed onset (two hours) of this anaphylactic shock is unusual. Although infrequent, it may be caused by the specific pharmacokinetic characteristics of this drug, which is a slow releasing agent, mainly absorbed in the gut. The drug was taken just after lunch, and this concomitant food ingestion could also have produced a delay in gastric drainage and a retarded drug absorption. An IgE-mediated accelerated type reaction could also explain this delay. Apparently the patient reacted after the first contact to the drug, and the absence of a <b>sensitization</b> <b>period</b> is not usual in this type of immune reponse. Finally, we recommend the performance of prick and intradermal skin tests prior to any systemic challenge when allergic reactions to fibric acid derivatives are suspected...|$|E
40|$|Background: Environmental {{factors are}} thought to {{contribute}} significantly to the increase of asthma prevalence {{in the last two}} decades. Bisphenol A (BPA) is a xenoestrogen commonly used in consumer products and the plastic industry. There is evidence and an ongoing discussion that endocrine disruptors like BPA may affect human health and also exert alterations on in the immune system. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate age-dependent effects of BPA on the asthma risk using a murine model to explain the controversial results reported till date. Methods: BALB/c mice were exposed to BPA via the drinking water for different time periods including pregnancy and breastfeeding. To induce an asthma phenotype, mice were sensitized to ovalbumin (OVA), followed by an intrapulmonary allergen challenge. Results: BPA exposure during pregnancy and breastfeeding had no significant effect on asthma development in the offspring. In contrast, lifelong exposure from birth until the last antigen challenge clearly increased eosinophilic inflammation in the lung, airway hyperreactivity and antigen-specific serum IgE levels in OVA-sensitized adult mice compared to mice without BPA exposure. Surprisingly, BPA intake during the <b>sensitization</b> <b>period</b> significantly reduced the development of allergic asthma. This effect was reversed in the presence of a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that the impact of BPA on asthma risk is strongly age-dependent and ranges fro...|$|E

However, this suppressive effect was lost if exposure to ZDV was delayed for 24 to 48 h during the antigen <b>sensitization</b> <b>period,</b> suggesting that antigen-primed CTL may be less susceptible than naive T lymphocytes to the suppressive effects of ZDV. The present study was undertaken to determine if naive T lymphocytes were {{more sensitive to the}} suppressive effects of ZDV than T lymphocytes previously exposed to antigen. The 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC 50) values of ZDV were determined on naive and antigen-primed T-cell responses in an alloantigen system. Lymphocyte cultures with continuous antigen exposure (double prime) were more resistant to ZDV suppression (IC 50 = 316 μM) than were naive lymphocytes (IC 50 = 87. 5 μM). Interestingly, lymphocytes that were antigen primed but deprived of antigen during the final 7 days of culture (prime/hold) were exquisitely sensitive to ZDV suppression (IC 50 = 29. 3 μM). The addition of 80 μM ZDV during the initial priming of the single-prime (prime/hold) and double-prime cultures did not select for a more drug-resistant cell population. The differences in ZDV sensitivities are likely a reflection of the physiological properties of the lymphocytes related to their activation state...|$|E
40|$|Virgin adult female mice display nearly {{spontaneous}} maternal care towards foster pups after a {{short period}} of sensitization. This indicates that maternal care is triggered by sensory stimulation provided by the pups and that its onset is largely independent on the physiological events related to gestation, parturition and lactation. Conversely, the factors influencing maternal aggression are poorly understood. In this study, we sought to characterize two models of maternal sensitization in the outbred CD 1 strain. To do so, a group of virgin females (godmothers) were exposed to continuous cohabitation with a lactating dam and their pups from the moment of parturition, whereas a second group (pup-sensitized females), were exposed 2 h daily to foster pups. Both groups were tested for maternal behavior on postnatal days 2 - 4. Godmothers expressed full maternal care from the first test. Also, they expressed higher levels of crouching than dams. Pup-sensitized females differed from dams in all measures of pup-directed behavior in the first test, and expressed full maternal care after two sessions of contact with pups. However, both protocols failed to induce maternal aggression toward a male intruder after full onset of pup-directed maternal behavior, even in the presence of pups. Our study confirms that adult female mice need a short <b>sensitization</b> <b>period</b> before the onset of maternal care. Further, it shows that pup-oriented and non-pup-oriented components of maternal behavior are under different physiological control. We conclude that the godmother model might be useful to study the physiological and neural bases of the maternal behavior repertoire...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. To evaluate the cell-mediated response to oral sensitization, outbred Hartley guinea pigs were fed pasteurized milk (100 ml/day) for a 2 - 4 week <b>sensitization</b> <b>period.</b> An in vitro proliferation assay was used to examine the antigen-specific responses in sensitized lymphocytes from spleen, mesenteric lymph node and blood. Peripheral blood and mesenteric lymph node lymphocytes were quite responsive whereas splenocytes responded poorly. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from orally sensitized guinea pigs responded significantly (p 0. 05). Even two months after the oral exposure, mesenteric lymph node lymphocytes still proliferated significantly (p< 0. 05), when cultured with cc and 0 caseins. However, reseeding cow's milk to guinea pigs didn't increase the proliferate response, and may even have induced suppression. Our results suggest that the optimum length of time required for oral sensitization is 2 weeks. Caseins (cc and 0) and 0 -lactoglobulin induced a significantly higher proliferate response after 2 weeks of oral sensitization. However, prolonged feeding for 4 weeks with cow's milk downregulated the antigenic response and upregulated the mitogenic response to a polyclonal T cell mitogen (Con A). T cell enrichment prior to culture demonstrated that the increased proliferation in nonenfiched T cell populations was influenced by antigen presenting cells. Using flow cytometric analysis, the study revealed a marked difference in the distribution of phenotypic markers in peripheral blood, spleen, and mesenteric lymph node of guinea pigs fed cow's milk for varying periods of time. Two weeks of oral sensitization yielded more T lymphocytes in spleen, with a predominance of the CD 8 subset in the mesenteric lymph node and spleen. On the other hand, 3 weeks of sensitization resulted in fewer CD 8 + T cells in the circulation and mesenteric lymph node which, in turn, correlated directly with the ability to enhance the lymphoproliferative reaction. Overall, this study demonstrated {{for the first time that}} the oral sensitization with cow's milk can induce antigenic-specific T lymphocyte responses in both local and systemic lymphoid compartments. Caseins (cc and 0) and 0 lactoglobulin were found to be the most common sensitizing T cell antigens in orally sensitized guinea pigs. The lymphocyte stimulation assay with highly purified antigens could be useful in the diagnosis of cow's milk allergy in humans...|$|E

O ciclo operacional de transporte de madeira é composto pelo carregamento de madeira no campo, viagem carregada, descarregamento, garagem e viagem vazia. Para tanto, utilizou-se como estudo de caso uma empresa produtora de celulose do Estado de Minas Gerais. Nesse modelo de cadeia logística de transporte de madeira, utilizou-se a Rede de Petri Temporal, por trabalhar com dois tempos que correspondem a uma duração de sensibilização.

As variações aplicadas nos cenários foram: melhoria das estradas florestais; aumento do número de carregadores; e melhoria da eficiência da garagem. Em ambas as regionais, o cenário com as três variações (Cenário 7) apresentou a maior redução nos tempos dos ciclos de transporte de madeira em relação à situação atual, sendo 19, 24 e 21, 48 %, respectivamente, para Rio Doce e Cocais das Estrelas.

The present work {{aimed at}} using {{the model of}} logistic performance evaluation of productive chains (ADELCAP) centered in the operational cycle time elements of wood transport, seeking to optimize the resources, to guarantee a continuous flow of supplying and to assure an appropriate volume of wood entrance in the industry. The wood transport cycle time consists of wood loading, wood hauling, wood unloading, garage and wood unhauling. A cellulose producing company in the State of Minas Gerais was used as case study. Initially, the logistics and supply chain of the company was diagnosed to know the main existent obstacles along the chain; defining their preliminary vary key parameters, based on the characterization of their structure and operation; finally, the main directors that condition their efficiency and competitiveness were identified and evaluated. The model of chain logistics of wood transport used the Temporal Petri Net for working with two times that correspond to a <b>sensitization</b> <b>period.</b> Their properties are as follows: simulation (working with hypothetical scenarios), dynamic (exit values depend on the entrance values); determinist (exit variables are not random); continuous (time is measured by real numbers); and temporal in the transitions.

40|$|The {{central nervous}} system has very limited ability to repair itself after injury but {{has been shown to}} exhibit {{remarkable}} experience-driven structural plasticity at the synaptic level. These changes correlate strongly with behavioral performance and are thought to underlie learning and memory. MAG, OMgp and Nogo are a group of neurite growth inhibitors present in CNS myelin and exerting effects by binding to a common receptor, NgR 1. Because Nogo is also expressed by neurons and NgR 1 is exclusively expressed in neurons and downregulated by activity, NgR 1 may regulate plasticity. For local synaptic plasticity to occur one requirement could be that NgR 1 signaling decreases. In fact, NgR 1 is rapidly downregulated in key areas associated with plasticity such as hippocampus in a variety of different models of neuronal activity. When NgR 1 is knocked out, mice show increased plasticity and continue to demonstrate ocular dominance shift plasticity in the visual cortex into adulthood. The aim of this thesis was to further investigate how the Nogo-system is regulated and to evaluate how it may influence memory formation. It is confirmed that increased neuronal activation (using Kainic acid) causes rapid downregulation of NgR 1 and a more detailed time course of this effect is presented. The NgR 1 downregulation might be further potentiated through an increase of the endogenous NgR 1 antagonist LOTUS in the dentate gyrus. In contrast to NgR 1, both NgR 2 and NgR 3 were mostly upregulated following Kainic acid injection. As the spectrum of known ligands for the different NgRs differ, this could result in a change in responsiveness to different inhibitor types and might favor increased local plasticity while keeping plasticity at the level of non-terminal axons and main dendrites in check. We created a mouse with inducible overexpression of NgR 1 in forebrain neurons (MemoFlex) to test the hypothesis that reduced NgR 1 levels are important for memory formation. We found that while NgR 1 overexpression does not impair 24 h memory and day to day learning, it significantly impairs formation of lasting memories as shown in both the Morris water maze and a passive avoidance test. By turning the NgR 1 transgene off (by doxycycline) at different time points, we were able to demonstrate that NgR 1 downregulation-dependent memory consolidation occurs during the first 7 - 9 days after a memory-forming event. MemoFlex mice exhibited increased sensitization to amphetamine (that could be normalized by turning off the transgene), as if they were unable to "learn" and hence cope with amphetamine injections lasting for as long as a week. When retested after 110 days MemoFlex mice showed a significant reduction of "sensitization memory" compared to their performance {{at the end of the}} <b>sensitization</b> <b>period.</b> Control mice tended to increase sensitization during the withdrawal period. Mice lacking NgR 1 did not differ from control mice with respect to a week-long amphetamine sensitization. Analysis of spine density and subtypes in the cingulate gyrus and the shell of nucleus accumbens indicated that NgR 1 overexpression has significant effects on spine dynamics. NgRs have also been shown to affect the deposition and formation of Aβ-plaques in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease. To test if NgR 1 overexpression would affect plaque deposition we crossed MemoFlex mice with plaque-forming APPswe/PSEN 1 mice. While we could not see any significant change in plaque formation in APPswe/PSEN 1 mice with NgR 1 overexpression, they were significantly impaired in the Morris water maze. The fact that performance was significantly decreased while plaque formation was unaffected could result from impairment of compensatory synaptic plasticity that otherwise occur in plaque-forming mice. Taken together, these studies suggest a role for the Nogo-system, and in particular NgR 1, for the formation of lasting memories...|$|E
