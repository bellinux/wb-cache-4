5|$|Wind figures {{prominently}} in several popular sports, including recreational hang gliding, hot air ballooning, kite flying, snowkiting, kite landboarding, kite surfing, paragliding, sailing, and windsurfing. In gliding, wind gradients {{just above the}} surface affect the takeoff and landing phases of flight of a glider. Wind gradient can have a noticeable effect on ground launches, also known as winch launches or wire launches. If the wind gradient is significant or sudden, or both, and the pilot maintains the same pitch attitude, the indicated airspeed will increase, possibly exceeding the maximum ground launch tow speed. The pilot must adjust the airspeed {{to deal with the}} effect of the gradient. When landing, wind shear is also a hazard, particularly when the winds are strong.

40|$|The flux of {{materials}} {{to the deep}} sea is dominated by larger, organic-rich particles with <b>sinking</b> <b>rates</b> varying between a few meters and several hundred meters per day. Mineral ballast may regulate the transfer of organic matter and other components by determining the <b>sinking</b> <b>rates,</b> e. g. via particle density. We calculated particle <b>sinking</b> <b>rates</b> from flux patterns and alkenone measurements applying sediment trap experiments from the Atlantic Ocean. We obtained higher particle <b>sinking</b> <b>rates</b> in carbonate-dominated production systems, both regionally and seasonally. During a summer coccolithophorid bloom in the Cape Blanc coastal upwelling off Mauritania, <b>sinking</b> <b>rates</b> reached almost 570 m per day, most probably due the fast sedimentation via zooplankton fecal pellets. During the recurring winter-spring blooms off NW Africa and in opal-rich production systems of the Southern Ocean, <b>sinking</b> <b>rates</b> of larger particles, most probably diatom aggregates, appeared to be lower. Although a tight and overall coupling between dust supply and particle <b>sinking</b> <b>rates</b> was not observed, it remains noticeable that the highest <b>sinking</b> <b>rates</b> occurred mostly in the dust-rich ocean regions off NW Africa. We obtained increasing <b>sinking</b> <b>rates</b> with depth. By using a seven-compartment biogeochemical model, it was shown that deep ocean organic carbon fluxes at a mesotrophic sediment trap site off Cape Blanc can be captured fairly well using seasonal variable particle <b>sinking</b> <b>rates.</b> Our model provides a total organic carbon flux of 0. 29 Tg per year down to 3000 m off the NW African upwelling region between 5 and 35 &deg; N...|$|R
40|$|There is {{an energy}} {{requirement}} {{for the maintenance of}} low <b>sinking</b> <b>rates</b> (~ 0. 1 m d-l) in the marine diatom Ditylum brightwellii. The lowest <b>sinking</b> <b>rates</b> occurred when cells were grown under ii-radiances saturating for growth. The highest <b>sinking</b> <b>rates</b> occurred when cells grown at growth-limiting irradiances were placed in the dark, or in cells treated with a respiratory inhibitor. Small cells sank more rapidly than large cells under saturating light, but under severe energy limitation <b>sinking</b> <b>rates</b> were directly proportional to cell volume. When cells were grown under saturating irradiance and then placed in the dark, their <b>sinking</b> <b>rate</b> increased as their respiration rate decreased over time. We suggest that when light is unavailable, a diatom’s ability to use energy gained from respiration may be the principal determinant of its <b>sinking</b> <b>rate.</b> We provide the first estimate of the dependence of cell <b>sinking</b> <b>rate</b> on cell respiration and suggest that the sinking-respiration relationship may be useful in predicting the sinking dynamics of diatoms during a bloom. We speculate that energetic sinking control may have evolved to allow diatoms to colonize the photic zone and that larger diatoms with lower <b>sinking</b> <b>rates</b> may have an ecological advantage over smaller diatoms with higher <b>sinking</b> <b>rates</b> early in a bloom. Although diatom blooms are the periods of highest yearly “new ” production and car-bon sedimentation (Burrell 1988), the spe-cific physiological mechanisms governing the process of diatom sedimentation are not well understood.

40|$|According to Stokes' law, colony {{formation}} in phytoplankton {{would lead to}} enhanced <b>sinking</b> <b>rates</b> and higher sedimentation losses if colonies had the same densities as the phytoplankton cells they contain. In the Dutch coastal zone of the North Sea, algae settling {{out of the water}} column are subject to zoobenthos grazing or to physical mixing into the sediment and, therefore, the formation of colonies by common diatom species and the prymnesiophyte Phaeocystis globosa seems paradoxical: it would increase the probability that sedimentation becomes a significant loss factor. However, <b>sinking</b> <b>rate</b> measurements in the Rhine region of freshwater influence (ROFI) using SetCol settling columns did not reveal a straightforward relationship between phytoplankton sizes (1000 mum) and <b>sinking</b> <b>rates</b> (- 0. 4 to > 2. 2 m day(- 1)) of 24 autotrophic phytoplankton species and groups. In fact, under nutrient-replete conditions, the <b>sinking</b> <b>rates</b> of the diatoms Chaetoceros radicans, Rhizosolenia shrubsolei and Rhizosolenia stolterfothii decreased with size. The <b>sinking</b> <b>rates</b> of large colonies of the prymnesiophyte P. globosa were also negatively correlated with their size and positive buoyancy was observed. Chlorophyll a <b>sinking</b> <b>rates</b> exceeded 1 m day(- 1) periodically, which is sufficient to cause significant surface layer loss rates over 0. 2 day(- 1). Under stratified conditions, both chlorophyll a concentrations and <b>sinking</b> <b>rates</b> in the bottom layer were significantly higher (+ 49 % and + 16 %, respectively) than in the surface layer. These observations are discussed in relation to Stokes' law, together with a critical analysis of the SetCol technique. It is concluded that: (i) SetCol gives adequate results when incubations are performed at or near in situ irradiance and temperature; (ii) <b>sinking</b> <b>rates</b> are predominantly determined by cell or colony density rather than their size; (iii) periodic sedimentation is an important species-specific loss process for phytoplankton in the Dutch coastal zone.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method {{to measure the}} <b>sinking</b> <b>rates</b> of individual phytoplankton “particles” (cells, chains, colonies, and aggregates) in the laboratory. Conventional particle tracking and high resolution video imaging were used to measure particle <b>sinking</b> <b>rates</b> and particle size. The stabilizing force of a very mild linear salinity gradient (1 ppt over 15 cm) prevented the formation of convection currents in the laboratory settling chamber. Whereas bulk settling methods such as SETCOL provide a single value of <b>sinking</b> <b>rate</b> for a population, this method allows the measurement of <b>sinking</b> <b>rate</b> and particle size for {{a large number of}} individual particles or phytoplankton within a population. The method has applications where <b>sinking</b> <b>rates</b> vary within a population, or where sinking rate-size relationships are important.

500|$|Fitch {{continued}} {{to control the}} aircraft's descent by adjusting engine thrust. With the loss of all hydraulics, the crew were unable to control airspeed independent from <b>sink</b> <b>rate.</b> On final descent, the aircraft was going 220 knots and sinking at 1,850 feet per minute (approximately 407km/h forward and 34km/h downward speed), while a safe landing would require 140 knots and 300 feet per minute (approximately 260km/h and 5km/h respectively). Fitch needed a seat for landing; Dvorak offered up his own, {{as it could be}} moved to a position behind the throttles. Dvorak sat in the cockpit's jump seat for landing. Fitch noticed the high <b>sink</b> <b>rate</b> and that the plane started to yaw right again, and pushed the throttles to full power in an attempt to mitigate the high <b>sink</b> <b>rate</b> and level the plane.

Witnesses reported that the aircraft [...] "cartwheeled" [...] end-over-end, but the investigation did not confirm this.

40|$|Diatoms are marine primary {{producers}} that sink in {{part due}} to the density of their silica frustules. Sinking of these phytoplankters is crucial for both the biological pump that sequesters carbon to the deep ocean and for the life strategy of the organism. <b>Sinking</b> <b>rates</b> have been previously measured through settling columns, or with fluorimeters or video microscopy arranged perpendicularly to the direction of sinking. These side-view techniques require large volumes of culture, specialized equipment and are difficult to scale up to multiple simultaneous measures for screening. We established a method for parallel, large scale analysis of multiple phytoplankton <b>sinking</b> <b>rates</b> through top-view monitoring of chlorophyll a fluorescence in microtitre well plates. We verified the method through experimental analysis of known factors that influence <b>sinking</b> <b>rates,</b> including exponential versus stationary growth phase in species of different cell sizes; Thalassiosira pseudonana CCMP 1335, chain-forming Skeletonema marinoi RO 5 A and Coscinodiscus radiatus CCMP 312.

500|$|Strong outflow from {{thunderstorms}} causes {{rapid changes}} in the three-dimensional wind velocity just above ground level.

40|$|The {{subsurface}} chlorophyll maximum (SCM) {{is widespread}} in the oligotrophic ocean and significantly contributes to primary production. One reason for the SCM formation {{is believed to be}} the rapid export of phytoplankton from surface layers, which might be caused by aggregation, faster <b>sinking</b> <b>rates</b> under nutrient limitation, or the formation of a resting stage. In this study, these three processes were included in a biological model to investigate their contributions to subsurface chlorophyll. To further identify their individual effects on SCM formation, four modeling experiments were carried out. Three used a simple approach with either (a) density-dependent aggregation, (b) accelerated <b>sinking</b> <b>rate</b> of phytoplankton, or (c) a resting stage. The other experiment combined all three approaches (a-c). A set of observations in the South China Sea was used to optimize the four experiments and compare their abilities to replicate observed values. The results of the experiments with the resting stage showed the best fit to the field observations. All experiments were able to capture major features of the chlorophyll field (e. g. surface bloom and SCM). The experiment with accelerated <b>sinking</b> <b>rate</b> failed to reproduce the observed profile of particulate organic carbon. The experiment with only aggregation predicted lower chlorophyll concentrations in summer than those measured in the field, while experiments with the resting stage reproduced more accurate chlorophyll concentrations. Formulas including the resting stage more successfully captured the timing of phytoplankton export than did those including aggregation and accelerated <b>sinking</b> <b>rate.</b> The processes of aggregation and accelerated <b>sinking</b> <b>rate</b> made small contributions to the SCM formation in the last experiment Overall, these results show that introducing the resting stage improves SCM simulations of the South China Sea. The results of the experiment with only the resting stage showed that the resting cells shift rapidly from the surface water, encounter better nutrient conditions in nutricline layers, partially germinate into vegetative cells, become shade-adapted, and increase subsurface chlorophyll concentrations during summer, which contributes to SCM formation.

The volume and porosity of aggregates decreased with increasing mineral concentrations, and at suspended mineral concentrations higher than 500 mu g L- 1 the initially medium-sized aggregates were fragmented into thousands of tiny, dense aggregates. Because radius and density have opposite effects on aggregate <b>sinking</b> <b>rates,</b> the relationship between aggregate particulate organic carbon (POC) to mineral ratio and <b>sinking</b> <b>rate</b> is not a straightforward one that necessarily results in higher <b>sinking</b> <b>rates</b> with increased mineral content. In these experiments the saturating capacity of organic aggregates for mineral particles appeared to be 97 to 98 weight-percent mineral (i. e., a POC to dry weight ratio of 0. 02 to 0. 03 mu g C mu g(- 1)). This parallels the values of 0. 05 mu g C mu g(- 1) observed for sinking particles in the deep sea and {{suggests that it is}} the flux of POC that determines the flux of minerals to the deep and not the other way around...|$|R
40|$|Rapidly sinking fecal pellets are an {{important}} component of the vertical flux of particulate organic matter (POM) from the surface to the ocean’s interior; however, few studies have examined the role fish play in this export. We determined abundance, size, prey composition, particulate organic carbon/nitrogen (POC/PON), and <b>sinking</b> <b>rates</b> of fecal pellets produced by a forage fish, likely the northern anchovy, in the Santa Barbara Channel. Pellet abundance ranged from 0. 1 – 5. 9 pelletsm 23. POC andPON contents averaged 21. 7 mg C pellet 21 and 2. 7 mg N pellet 21. The <b>sinking</b> <b>rate</b> averaged 787 m d 21; thus pellets produced at the surface would reach the benthos (, 500 m) in, 1 day. Estimated downward flux of fish fecal POC reached a maximum of 251 mg C m 22 d 21. This is equal to or exceeds previous measurements of sediment trap POM flux, and thus may transport significant amounts of repackaged surface material to depth. R apidly sinking fecal pellets are a major contributor to the ‘biological pump’, the vertical transport of biologically generated particulate organic matter (POM) from the surface to the ocean’s interior. <b>Sinking</b> <b>rates</b> of small or low mass fecal pellets of some zooplankton (i. e., copepods, euphausiids, doliolids, appendicularians, heteropods), as well as phytodetritus and marine snow, range from, 10 to hundreds of meter...|$|R
