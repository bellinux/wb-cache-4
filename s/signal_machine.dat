40|$|International audienceExtended Signal {{machines}} are proven able to compute any computable {{function in the}} understanding of recursive/computable analysis (CA), here type- 2 Turing machines (T 2 -TM) with signed binary encoding. This relies on an intermediate representation of any real number as an integer (in signed binary) plus an exact value in (- 1, 1) which allows to have only finitely many signals present outside of the computation. Extracting a (signed) bit, improving the precision by one bit and iterating the T 2 -TM only involve standard signal machines. For exact CA-computations, T 2 -TM have to deal with an infinite entry and to run through infinitely many iterations to produce an infinite output.

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of intracellular signaling networks, there is currently no consensus regarding the fundamental nature of the protein complexes such networks employ. One prominent view involves stable <b>signaling</b> <b>machines</b> with well-defined quaternary structures. The combinatorial complexity of signaling networks {{has led to an}} opposing perspective, namely that signaling proceeds via heterogeneous pleiomorphic ensembles of transient complexes. Since many hypotheses regarding network function rely on how we conceptualize signaling complexes, resolving this issue is a central problem in systems biology. Unfortunately, direct experimental characterization of these complexes has proven technologically difficult, while combinatorial complexity has prevented traditional modeling methods from approaching this question. Here we employ rule-based modeling, a technique that overcomes these limitations, to construct a model of the yeast pheromone signaling network. We found that this model exhibits significant ensemble character while generating reliable responses that match experimental observations. To contrast the ensemble behavior, we constructed a model that employs hierarchical assembly pathways to produce scaffold-based <b>signaling</b> <b>machines.</b> We found that this machine model could not replicate the experimentally observed combinatorial inhibition that arises when the scaffold is overexpressed.
