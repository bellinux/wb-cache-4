5|$|In 1936, {{with the}} help of a friend, the then 28-year-old Ho set up shop in Chinatown with only a comb, a stool, and a {{kerosene}} lamp. She worked from 8am to 3am, charging five cents to comb hair or weave plaits and buns for amahs and Samsui women. She did that every day for almost three decades, interrupted only by periods when she was incapacitated by acute attacks of arthritis. She scrimped and saved, and by the time she was in her 40s, she had enough to buy a shophouse in Club Street. Although illiterate, she made some property investments and eventually became a landlord, renting out rooms. As her wealth grew, she acquired more properties, and she began to adopt children from poor families, becoming a <b>single</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> six daughters and twenty-five godchildren.|$|E
5|$|Dusten Brown is {{a member}} of the Cherokee Nation. Brown served in the United States Army at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. Christina Maldonado was a non-Indian <b>single</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> two. Brown and Maldonado became engaged to be married in December 2008, and Maldonado {{informed}} Brown that she was pregnant in January 2009. On learning that Maldonado was pregnant, Brown began to press her to go ahead and marry him, and refused to provide any financial support until after the two had married. In May 2009, Maldonado broke off the engagement by text message and cut all communications with Brown. In June, Maldonado sent Brown a text message asking if he would rather pay child support or relinquish his parental rights. Brown responded via text message that he relinquished his rights. No child support order was in place at this time. Furthermore, while laws vary from state to state, it is generally impossible for any parent, male or female, to surrender their parental rights without a court hearing that determines the best interest of the child. A father cannot terminate his parental rights by contract, much less by more informal means (such as by text message).|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} impact of {{employment}} status and work conditions {{on the quality of}} the home environment provided by <b>single</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> preschool-age children. Multivariate analyses were conducted using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. The results indicate that employment status is not a significant predictor of the quality of the home environment among <b>single</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> young children when family size and welfare use are controlled. Among <b>single</b> working <b>mothers,</b> several job con-ditions were related to the quality of the home environment. <b>Single</b> <b>mothers</b> who were employed part-time and in low-wage jobs had significantly poorer home environments. <b>Single</b> <b>mothers</b> who work nonstandard hours generally have poorer home environments, with the exception of rotating shifts. These findings highlight the importance of examining the effects of employment status and job conditions on within-group differences in the quality of the home environment among single-mother families...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the responses to a sexuality education questionnaire completed by 30 <b>single</b> <b>mothers</b> and 43 married mothers with preschool-aged children. Chi-square analyses were used to examine differences between married <b>mothers</b> and <b>single</b> mothers; <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> males and <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> females; and married <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> males, married <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> females, <b>single</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> males and <b>single</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> females. Age at which their preschool children first exhibited behaviors, frequency of that behavior, and comfort level <b>of</b> <b>mothers</b> 2 ̆ 7 responses to those behaviors were addressed for each topic: male-female differences, reproduction and birth, privacy or modesty, taboo or obscene words, genital play, and sexual exploration play. Very few statistically significant differences were apparent in the comparisons that were made. Married mothers were more comfortable than <b>single</b> <b>mother</b> in responding to their child 2 ̆ 7 s questions about male-female differences and their child 2 ̆ 7 s use of taboo or obscene words. In addition, some interesting trends emerged. For instance, mothers tended to ex press more comfort when responding to hypothetical situations than when responding to actual situations. Questions about male-female differences, reproduction and birth, and privacy or modesty were responded to more frequently than questions about taboo or obscene words, genital play, or sexual exploration play. Moreover, maternal observation of behaviors {{that appeared to be}} more sensitive (and less comfortable, such as taboo or obscene words, genital play, and sexual exploration play) was lower than observation of less sensitive behaviors (male-female differences, privacy or modesty, and reproduction and birth). The implications of this study and directions for future research are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The Strategies to Enhance Positive Parenting (STEPP) {{program was}} {{developed}} to address putative factors related to poor engagement in and outcomes following traditional behavioral parent training (BPT) for <b>single</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> children diagnosed with ADHD. Method: Twelve <b>single</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> children with ADHD were enrolled in an initial investigation of the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the 9 -week STEPP program. Results: Results indicated that the STEPP program was effective in reducing problematic child behavior and improving parental stress and psychopathology at posttreatment. The STEPP program resulted in high rates of treatment attendance and completion and consumer satisfaction with the program. However, results also indicated that the STEPP program did not improve childrens’ overall psychosocial impairment and resulted in small effect size findings across measures. Conclusion: The results of the pilot study are encouraging but indicate a need to improve the potency and delivery of {{certain aspects of the}} STEPP program...|$|R

40|$|The {{number of}} {{households}} headed by <b>single</b> <b>mothers</b> living in poverty exceeds that of all other categories of poverty-stricken households, and poverty impacts the children negatively in various ways. When <b>single</b> <b>mothers</b> choose not to continue their education, they lessen their chances of finding higher paying jobs and raising their families out of poverty. The purpose of this phenomenological study was to better understand why some <b>single</b> <b>mothers</b> decided to continue into higher education. The study considered the decisions <b>of</b> 6 <b>single</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> young children in Montgomery County, Texas, and the obstacles they overcame while completing their education. The women were recruited from a co parenting workshop using snowball sampling. The inclusion criteria included <b>single</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> children ages 0 - 10 years old and who obtained a degree or specialized certificate. The conceptual framework was based on Bandura 2 ̆ 7 s concept of self-efficacy and Carspecken 2 ̆ 7 s critical theory. Interviews were used with the 6 women to collect data that were then transcribed, compared, coded, and thematically analyzed. Emergent themes included overcoming obstacles, receiving help from others, acting as their children 2 ̆ 7 s role models, dealing {{with the impact of}} the father 2 ̆ 7 s absence, and receiving motivation from their own parents. The social significance of this research is that it illuminates the problem of poverty among single female-headed households and increases the understanding <b>of</b> why some <b>single</b> <b>mothers</b> decide to continue into higher education...|$|R

25|$|Whilst {{creating}} {{the show that}} was to become Shortland Street, Caterina De Nave set out to pursue many goals, {{one of which was}} to have strong powerful women as primary characters to counter stereotype the weak and vulnerable women often portrayed in dramas. De Nave and Television New Zealand also wished for as wide demographics as possible and many measures were set about to ensure the soap would reach a diverse audience. To fulfill this, De Nave created the roles of teenagers such as Nick Harrison, Stuart Neilson and Kirsty Knight to draw in a young audience. Family units were also commonly used in soap operas to sustain a wide variety of demographics in one group of characters and as such, the characters of Nick and Stuart were built around a family unit, with the <b>single</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> Nick's, Jenny, being created to represent single parent families. Jenny was characterized to embody the strong matriarch De Nave wished to portray. Maggie Harper had just started a 4-year course on the natural healing technique, the Feidenkrais method, when she was cast in the role. She was said to bring her own strength and experience to the part. Jenny made her debut on the show's second episode, screened 26 May 1992.|$|E

500|$|Mukesh Chhabra was the film's casting director. Swara Bhaskar was {{the first}} to be cast in the role of Chanda Sahay, a <b>single</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> a 15-year-old girl. Initially sceptical about playing a mother on screen early in her career, she changed her mind after reading the script. To {{understand}} the role better, Bhaskar stayed with professional domestic helpers from Agra, Uttar Pradesh, where the film is set. She bought such props as a handbag, a comb, a pocket mirror, and rubber chappals. She also drew guidance from her mother's experiences of handling a teenage daughter. After the film's release, Bhaskar {{said in an interview with}} Daily News and Analysis that her friends in the Hindi film industry advised her not to take up the role as they felt it would be a [...] "career suicide" [...] for her. She agreed to participate in the project because [...] "the story stayed in [...] mind". The next role to be cast was that of the 15-year-old daughter of the protagonist. Ria Shukla was selected for the role after auditions in Lucknow. Ratna Pathak and Pankaj Tripathi play supporting roles in the film.

Posner, writing in 1990, disagreed with Noonan and with feminist critics following him, noting that judges take an oath to do equal justice to rich and poor, [...] "so the fact that Mrs. Palsgraf was poor would not have been a principled ground for bending the rules in her favor". Noonan had considered unjust the award of court costs against Palsgraf, and in her 2016 book, law professor Cathleen Kaveny agreed, [...] "the penalty imposed on Palsgraf for seeking justice through the courts was to deprive her, a <b>single</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>of</b> the ability to support her children...
