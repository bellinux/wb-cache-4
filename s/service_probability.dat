We consider Zipf-like local content popularity with variables indicating the correlation level of user interests in the same region. Based on stochastic spatial models for the small cell base station (SCBS) and user distribution, we provide analytical results on the cache <b>service</b> <b>probability,</b> i. e. the probability that an arbitrary user finds its requested content cached in its nearby SCBSs. The tradeoff between the <b>service</b> <b>probability</b> and the sampling cost is discussed and the optimal sampling range given by maximizing the <b>service</b> <b>probability</b> under the cost constraint is derived. Numerical results with different correlation levels of local user interests are given, which validate our analysis on the service-cost tradeoff...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – A new {{technique}} is proposed for performance evaluation of random access protocols. This technique {{is based on}} the idea that the <b>service</b> <b>probability</b> distribution of a particular random access protocol can be described by a phase-type distribution. By modeling the <b>service</b> <b>probability</b> distribution of a protocol into a phase-type distribution, the performance of the protocol can be evaluated using an equivalent Continuous Time Markov Chain. In this paper we demonstrate the applicability of the technique to performance evaluation of the IEEE 802. 3 and the IEEE 802. 11 MAC protocols. Furthermore, we provide an example of performance evaluation of a MAC protocol subject to bursty traffic models such as the Markov Modulated Poisson Process.

40|$|Linear pooling {{is by far}} {{the most}} popular method for {{combining}} probability forecasts. However, any non-trivial weighted average of two or more distinct, calibrated probability forecasts is necessarily uncalibrated and lacks sharpness. In view of this, linear pooling requires recalibration, even in the ideal case in which the individual forecasts are calibrated. Towards this end, we propose a beta-transformed linear opinion pool for the aggregation of probability forecasts from distinct, calibrated or uncalibrated sources. The method fits an optimal non-linearly recalibrated forecast combination, by compositing a beta transform and the traditional linear opinion pool. The technique is illustrated in a simulation example and in a case-study on statistical and National Weather <b>Service</b> <b>probability</b> of precipitation forecasts.

40|$|Using {{directed}} {{search to}} model the product market and the labor market, I show that large plants can pay higher wages to homogeneous workers and earn higher expected profit per worker than small plants, although plants are identical except size. A large plant charges a higher price for its product and compensates buyers with a higher <b>service</b> <b>probability.</b> To capture this size- related benefit, large plants try to become larger by recruiting at high wages. This size-wage differential survives labor market competition because a high wage is harder to get than a low wage. Moreover, the size-wage differential increases with the product demand when demand is initially low and falls when demand is already high.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this master's thesis is to evaluate the optimum performance of sixsectored hexagonal layout of WCDMA (UMTS) network and analyze the performance at the optimum point. The maximum coverage and the maximum capacity are the main concern of service providers and {{it is always a}} challenging task for them to achieve economically. Because the optimum configuration of a network corresponds to a configuration which minimizes the number of sites required to provide a target <b>service</b> <b>probability</b> in the planning area which in turn reduces the deployment cost. The optimum performance means the maximum cell area and themaximum cell capacity the network can provide at the maximum antenna height satisfying the target <b>service</b> <b>probability.</b> Hexagon layout has been proven as the best layout for the cell deployment. In this thesis work, two different configurations using six-sectored sites have been considered for the performance comparison. In first configuration, each antenna is directed towards each corner of hexagon, whereas in second configurationeach antenna is directed towards each side of hexagon. The net difference in the configurations is the 30 degree rotation of antenna direction. The only indoor users in a flat and smooth semi-urban environment area have been considered for the simulation purpose where the traffic distribution is 100 Erl/km 2 with 12. 2 kbps speech service having maximum mobile speed of 3 km/hr. The simulation results indicate that a similar performance can be achieved in both the configurations, that is, a maximum of 947 m cellrange at antenna height of 49. 5 m can be achieved when the antennas are directed towards the corner of hexagon, whereas 943. 3 m cell range atantenna height of 54 m can be achieved when the antennas are directed towards the side of hexagon. However, from the interference point of view the first configuration provides better results. The simulation results also show that the network is coverage limited in both the uplink and downlink direction at the optimum point...|$|E

When not considering rejuvenations, A can be deduced by integrating the reliability (R) across time and normalizing the result to the MT (see (19) in the Appendix). Both R and A increase with rejuvenations, because it becomes more difficult for an attack to succeed in surpassing the intrusion tolerance thresholdf. However, with rejuvenations A has the extra benefit of accounting also the moments of correctness obtained after a first global failure. Thus, A is positive even for an infinite mission time (MT). This is pertinent whenever global failure is not considered as a catastrophic event and the re-establishment of service is considered worthy.

Our objective is to maximize the <b>service</b> <b>probability</b> of the SU, subject to the interference constraints on the primary users (PUs) {{in the form of}} probability. Exploiting imperfect channel state information (CSI), with its error modeled by added Gaussian noise, we address the optimization for the beamforming weights at the secondary transmitter. In particular, this letter devises an iterative algorithm that can efficiently obtain the robust optimal beamforming solution. For the case with one PU, we show that a much simpler algorithm based on a closed-form solution for the antenna weights of a given power can be presented. Numerical results reveal that the optimal solution for the constructed problem provides an effective means to tradeoff the performance between the PUs and the SU, bridging the non-robust and worstcase based systems. © 2010 IEEE. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

The system for acoustic source localization and identification has been presented as a model of mass servicing system. The states of the system as well as its features have been described while the formula for <b>service</b> <b>probability</b> determination has been derived as a criterion for effectiveness evaluation. The introductory part of the article describes the system for acoustic source localization and identification and shows a model for quantity estimation of the function of technical system effectiveness E (t). The system effectiveness represents a probability of system initiation as well as a probability of its successful mission accomplishment on the basis of designed capabilities within the given time period and operational conditions. The basic characteristics of the Boomerang system for acoustic source localization and identification show the system elements and its designed capability to detect, analyse and distribute acoustic source location data. The analytical model for the evaluation of the effectiveness of the Boomerang system for acoustic source localization and identification shows that 'n' stations for acoustic source localization can exchange information with each other using the network link. The system conditions are described and the expression for the determination of <b>service</b> <b>probability</b> as a criterion for system effectiveness evaluation is derived. The evaluation of the effectiveness of the Boomerang system for acoustic source localization and identification is presented with a formula for determining mass servicing system probability from the Matlab 6. 5 R 13 program.
