5|$|The Audubon Naturalist Society also {{actively}} opposed such spraying programs, and recruited Carson to {{help make}} public the government's exact spraying practices and the related research. Carson began the four-year project of what would become Silent Spring by gathering examples of environmental damage attributed to DDT. She also attempted to enlist others to join the cause: essayist E. B. White, {{and a number of}} journalists and scientists. By 1958, Carson had arranged a book deal, with plans to co-write with Newsweek science journalist Edwin Diamond. However, when The New Yorker commissioned a long and well-paid article on the topic from Carson, she began considering writing more than simply the introduction and conclusion as planned; <b>soon</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a solo project. (Diamond would later write one of the harshest critiques of Silent Spring).|$|E
5|$|Before {{moving over}} the mountains, the 20th Division {{headquarters}} elected to destroy its cryptographic materials rather than carry them. As the wet weather made burning them page by page {{a slow and}} difficult process, and a fire might {{attract the attention of}} the Allied Air Forces, someone decided to simply bury them in a steel trunk in a stream bed. An Australian sapper checking the stream bed for booby traps with a metal detector discovered it, and it was dug up in the belief that it was a mine. An intelligence officer recognised the contents as code books and <b>soon</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{on its way to the}} Central Bureau in Brisbane. There, the pages were carefully dried out and photographed. On 4 February 1944, Central Bureau codebreakers decrypted a thirteen-part message that laid out the decisions reached at a conference of high-ranking Japanese officers. Copies of the material were quickly sent to Arlington Hall. In January 1944, Arlington Hall had decrypted 1,846 Japanese army messages. In March 1944, with the Sio code books in hand, it decrypted 36,000 messages.|$|E

5|$|Yakut Khan {{landed at}} Sewri on 14 February 1689, and razed the Mazagon Fort in June 1690. After a payment {{made by the}} British to Aurangzeb, the ruler of the Mughal Empire, Yakut {{evacuated}} Bombay on 8 June 1690. The arrival of many Indian and British merchants {{led to the development}} of Bombay's trade by the end of the seventeenth century. <b>Soon</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> trading in salt, rice, ivory, cloth, lead and sword blades with many Indian ports as well as with the Arabian cities of Mecca and Basra. By 1710, the construction of Bombay Castle was finished, which fortified the islands from sea attacks by European pirates and the Marathas. By 26 December 1715, Charles Boone assumed the Governorship of Bombay. He implemented Aungier's plans for the fortification of the island, and had walls built from Dongri in the north to Mendham's point in the south. He established the Marine force, and constructed the St. Thomas Cathedral in 1718, which was the first Anglican Church in Bombay. In 1728, a Mayor's court was established in Bombay and the first reclamation was started which was a temporary work in Mahalaxmi, on the creek separating Bombay from Worli. The shipbuilding industry started in Bombay in 1735 and soon the Naval Dockyard was established in the same year.|$|E

25|$|Beta-catenin was {{initially}} {{discovered in the}} early 1990s {{as a component of}} a mammalian cell adhesion complex: a protein responsible for cytoplasmatic anchoring of cadherins. But very <b>soon,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> realized that the Drosophila protein armadillo – implicated in mediating the morphogenic effects of Wingless/Wnt – is homologous to the mammalian β-catenin, not just in structure but also in function. Thus beta-catenin became one of the very first examples of moonlighting: a protein performing more than one radically different cellular function.|$|E
25|$|Mammals {{have two}} isoenzymes, that are {{chemically}} very different, TK1 and TK2. The former was first found in fetal tissue, {{the second was}} found to be more abundant in adult tissue, and initially they were termed fetal and adult thymidine kinase. <b>Soon</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> shown that TK1 is present in the cytoplasm only in anticipation of cell division (cell cycle-dependent), whereas TK2 is located in mitochondria and is cell cycle-independent. The two isoenzymes have different reaction kinetics and are inhibited by different inhibitors.|$|E
25|$|The rising was {{championed by}} Marxist {{cultural}} activists from Bengal. Salil Chaudhury wrote a revolutionary song in 1946 {{on behalf of}} the Indian People’s Theatre Association (IPTA). Later, Hemanga Biswas, another veteran of the IPTA, penned a commemorative tribute. A Bengali play based on the incident, Kallol (Sound of the Wave), by radical playwright Utpal Dutt, became an important anti-establishment statement, when it was first performed in 1965 in Calcutta. It drew large crowds to the Minerva Theatre where it was being performed; <b>soon</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> banned by the Congress government of West Bengal and its writer imprisoned for several months.|$|E

The Livonian Coast was occupied by the Germans in 1915. At their approach, many Livonians fled their homes, often never to return. Their main destinations were Estonia and inner parts of Latvia. The rest of the people were driven from their homes by the Germans and had to wait until 1919 before they were allowed to return.|$|E
25|$|After the {{economic}} doldrums of the 1960s and early 1970s, the city's economy began to recover in the 1980s. An early sign of that change {{was in the}} neighborhood of Ocean Park. Main Street, a quaint mile of sawdust bars and dilapidated stores selling old furniture, was upgraded by the concerted efforts {{of a new generation of}} owners. <b>Soon</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> attracting increasingly expensive boutiques and restaurants. At the northern end of Main Street adjacent to the still-declining Santa Monica Mall, a city block was levelled in 1980 to build a new mall, Santa Monica Place, designed by architect Frank Gehry. Further south on Main Street, the mixed-use museum, retail, and restaurant complex, Edgemar – also designed by Frank Gehry – opened in 1988.|$|E
25|$|The Germans {{began their}} {{invasion}} of Greece on 6 April {{and within a}} few days, the Aliakmon Line was abandoned with the brigade being withdrawn to Olympus Pass and into a series of rearguard actions. <b>Soon</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> decided to evacuate the Allied forces and 6th Brigade covered {{the early stages of the}} withdrawal. At this stage, the brigade was located near Monemvasia along with British and Australian personnel. The brigade duly embarked from Monemvasia on 29 April on the Royal Navy cruiser HMS Ajax and four destroyers, with the 24th Battalion acting as the rearguard for the evacuation. The ships arrived later that day off Crete. While the 4th and 5th Brigades were to remain on Crete, the 6th was transferred to a pair of transports which went onto Egypt, arriving on 2 May. It would play no role in the Battle of Crete.|$|E

25|$|The 5th Ural Infantry Division was {{organised}} {{during the}} Russian Civil War on September 3, 1918, out of several smaller partisan detachments in Birsky Uyezd of Perm Governorate. <b>Soon</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> reinforced {{with a single}} artillery battery from Sankt Petersburg and two Workers' Brigades from the Arkhangelsk Front. The division fought in the Eastern Front of the Russian Civil War against the White Army led by Alexander Kolchak. It {{was part of the}} 3rd Army and fought in battles around Osa during the defence of Perm from November 29 to January 6, 1919. Transferred to the 2nd Army in January, it defended the Kama area in battles on the Kungur direction in the Osa area from January to March. During the Spring Offensive of the Russian Army between March and May, the division retreated to the line of the Kama River and the Vyatka River. On March 19 it was renamed the 21st Rifle Division. When the Red counteroffensive began in May, the division fought in the Sarapul–Votkinsk operation between May 25 and June 12, advancing towards Izhevsk and Votkinsk and reaching the mouth of the Vala River. It then fought in the Perm Offensive between June 21 and July 1, crossing the Kama, Osa, and Iren Rivers and capturing the cities of Osa, Okhansk, and Kungur.|$|E
500|$|The {{domestication}} {{of poultry}} took place several thousand years ago. This may have originally been {{as a result}} of people hatching and rearing young birds from eggs collected from the wild, but later involved keeping the birds permanently in captivity.

The group's first choice was Senator Robert Kennedy, who declined, as did another, and by late September 1967 they approached McGovern. After much deliberation McGovern declined, largely because he feared such a run would significantly damage his own chances for reelection to his Senate seat in 1968.
