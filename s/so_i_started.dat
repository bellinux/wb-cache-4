5|$|When we came {{to record}} it in the studio we {{struggled}} because there was something just not quite right about it and I wasn't happy about where we'd left it and where we were happy to leave it and we couldn't put our finger on what it was {{and so it was}} a really nice day one day, me and Chris were just trying, I was actually just trying to record bass at the time and me and Chris were just sitting down trying to brainstorm it and work out what was wrong and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> trying to just do a few different bass lines and stuff. Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E

I already knew that my parents had been burned on their first day at the extermination camp of Auschwitz. I was alone. Other prisoners who were with me had nobody either. These days, I am with a young man that I had known in Brussels. We do not separate from each other. We were both survivors of the camps. Shortly after, we married, two refugees who had nothing, there {{was not even a}} rabbi to give us the blessing.

40|$|Although rarely pointed out, Henri Bergson（ 1859 - 1941 ）was highly {{interested}} in psychical phenomena, {{or to be}} exact, in researches on such phenomena. But why? In this paper I am going to clarify the reason. Unfortunately there is no article in which Bergson directly mentions psychical researches except for ““Phantasms of the Living” and “Psychical Research””（ 1913 ）. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>start</b> by examining this exceptional article, and after that I turn my eyes to several related articles.

500|$|Cobain did {{not begin}} to write [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] until {{a few weeks before}} {{recording}} started on Nirvana's second album, Nevermind, in 1991. When he first presented the song to his bandmates, it comprised just the main riff and the chorus vocal melody, which bassist Krist Novoselic dismissed at the time as [...] "ridiculous." [...] In response, Cobain made the band play the riff for [...] "an hour and a half." [...] In a 2001 interview, Novoselic recalled that after playing the riff repeatedly, he thought, Wait a minute.

500|$|During the two-month American tour, {{the band}} became {{increasingly}} unhappy, often venting frustrations on each other, leading to several physical confrontations. The band members were homesick; Albarn said, [...] "I {{just started to}} miss really simple things ... I missed everything about England <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> writing songs which created an English atmosphere." [...] Upon the group's return to Britain, Blur (Albarn in particular) were upset by the success rival group Suede had achieved while they were gone. After a poor performance at a 1992 gig that featured a well-received set by Suede on the same bill, Blur {{were in danger of}} being dropped by Food. By that time, Blur had undergone an ideological and image shift intended to celebrate their English heritage in contrast to the popularity of American grunge bands like Nirvana. Although sceptical of Albarn's new manifesto for Blur, Balfe gave assent for the band's choice of Andy Partridge (of XTC) to produce their follow-up to Leisure. The sessions with Partridge proved unsatisfactory, but a chance reunion with Stephen Street resulted in him returning to produce the group.|$|E

I regained control of the aircraft and pulled out above a wheat field. I tried to contact the flight to get myself recognized, but observed an Me 109 making a pass at me from about seven o'clock high. I broke left as well as my plane could and the Jerry overshot. I straightened out and gave him a burst. He chandelled steeply to the left and I shot some more. He passed right over me and I slipped over in an Immelmann. As I straightened out at the top, I saw the pilot bail out.|$|E

Stanlee began wearing ring jackets, which was a rarity in that era, and also had monogrammed towels—"Wrestling's TV King"—which he wore once he took off the ring jacket. His elaborate entrance infuriated opponents, both faces and heels, but also meant he appeared on over 200 magazine covers during his career.|$|R

I was thinking about head-first versus feet-first, and wondering which would save my body. With head-first I worried about pounding my shoulders and my hands, and with feet-first I would worry about my knees and my legs. I felt that running was more important to me, with my legs, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> going head-first. I got my [...] technique from airplanes...I was on a plane and asleep and the plane bounced and when we landed we bounced and it woke me up. Then the next flight I had the same pilot and the plane went down so smooth. So I asked the pilot why, and he said when you land a plane smooth, you get the plane elevated to the lowest position you can and then you smooth it in. Same with sliding... If you dive when you're running straight up then you have a long distance to get to the ground. But the closer you get to the ground the less time it will take... I was hitting the dirt so smooth, so fast, when I hit the dirt, there wasn't no hesitation. It was like a skid mark, like you throw a rock on the water and skid off it. So when I hit the ground, if you didn't have the tag down, I was by you. No matter if the ball beat me, I was by you. That was what made the close plays go my way, I think." ...|$|E
