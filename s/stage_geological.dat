40|$|The {{geological}} {{evolution of}} the southwest Rockall Plateau {{in the area of}} Edoras Bank has been clarified using seismic reflection, gravity and magnetic data. Four principal reflectors are observed within the Tertiary sedimentary sequence: I, Late Miocene; 11, latest Early Miocene; 111, Late Eocene; IV, earliest Eocene. A period of pronounced sediment drift accumulation marks the interval 1 - 11. Reflector 111, the top of a sediment wedge prograding southward from Edoras Bank, marks a change from terrigenous to pelagic sedimentation that is probably related to subsidence of the Rockall Plateau following the separation of Greenland from Eurasia in the earliest Eocene. Reflector IV marks the top of a wedge-shaped seismically transparent layer that also thins southward away from Edoras Bank. On the basis of its seismic attributes and magnetic signature, this layer is interpreted as a volcanic sheet, formed as part of the North Atlantic Tertiary Volcanic Province during rifting of Greenland from Eurasia. The recognition of voluminous volcanic rocks south of Edoras Bank extends the known area of the Tertiary volcanic province several hundred kilometres to the south. Gravity anomaly modelling and continental reconstructions suggest that the region south of Edoras Bank is underlain by thinned continental crust. A four <b>stage</b> <b>geological</b> evolution for this region is indicated. (i) Initial rifting associated with the separation of Labrador from Greenland in the late Cretaceous is characterized by enhanced crustal thinning and subsidence in the region of a rift triple junction. (ii) Passive subsidence and accumulation of late Cretaceous and earliest Tertiary sediments followed the initiation of seafloor spreading in the Labrador Sea. (iii) Blanketing of the area by Palaeocene volcanic rocks masked pre-existing magnetic lineations, providing an explanation for some of the problems in earlier interpretations based mainly on magnetic data. (iv) Post-volcanic sedimentation, continuing to the present day...|$|E
30|$|An {{energy policy}} that {{considers}} differences among {{oil and gas}} resources is not original. As early as 1980, the Crude Oil Windfall Profit Tax Act in the USA classified crude oil into three categories and established three corresponding levels of profit tax rates (Logan 1980). Relevant {{studies show that the}} implementation of differential profits taxation has had a relatively large impact on US domestic oil production, especially on low-production wells and poor-quality resources (Knoll 1987; Verleger 1980). Similarly, scholars in China believe that the existing tax policy insufficiently encourages the development of inferior-quality oil and gas resources with lower profits, and suggest differential tax rates for different levels of resources according to the development <b>stage,</b> <b>geological</b> conditions and other relevant factors; they also propose some methods of classification (Luo 2005; Li et al. 2014; Ding and Dai, 2013). In the standard “Specifications for Coalbed Methane Resources/Reserves” (DZ/T 0216 - 2010) issued by the Ministry of Land and Resources of the People’s Republic of China, CBM resources are categorized separately by just one of the indicators of reserve scale, reserve abundance, production or buried depth (The Ministry of Land and Resources 2011). However, this grading method using a single factor fails to distinguish the general quality of the resources. For example, it is difficult to grade two deposits—A, with a deeper buried depth but high abundance of reserves, and B, with a shallower buried depth but low abundance of reserves—with this method of classification. To solve this problem, Li et al. (2016) proposed a comprehensive grading method that grades resources by both reserve scale and reserve economic value (measured by net present value (NPV)) under different discount rates. This method may be used to comprehensively classify resources; however, it requires an accurate calculation each time it is used, which is a serious obstacle; furthermore, policy makers usually lack the necessary professional knowledge to perform the calculation. Therefore, this method is not ideal for policy making.|$|E

30|$|The {{genesis of}} the Sarvak {{unsteady}} reservoir in Azadegan oil field can be generalized as follows: the paleo-trap of the Sarvak formed at an early <b>geological</b> <b>stage</b> (after the upper Cretaceous) and the paleo-reservoir formed at a later <b>geological</b> <b>stage</b> (after the middle Miocene). The secondary reservoir adjustment caused by tectonic activity occurred at an ultra-late stage (after the Pliocene). The characteristics of the Sarvak reservoir are those of a massive carbonate reservoir with strong heterogeneity both vertically and laterally, and reservoir quality degrades along the secondary migration path, with a very short readjustment time span and high-viscosity crude oil. These factors together result in reservoir readjustment at a very slow rate and insufficient secondary readjustment. This has ultimately formed the unsteady reservoir with the irregular tilted OWC.|$|R
