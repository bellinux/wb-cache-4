40|$|The {{practice}} of <b>stockpiling</b> forage {{for the fall}} and winter has become a popular feeding strategy used to extend the grazing season and maintain profitability of beef operation in the Canadian Great Plains Region. This thesis research was conducted in the field to determine the potential of perennial and annual species with the major focus on <b>stockpiled</b> forage dry matter yield and late fall forage quality. Five cultivars from four grass species and three cultivars from two legume species were seeded using grass-legume binary mixture or monocultures for the perennial forage trial, and managed under two different <b>stockpile</b> initiation treatments. Five cool-season and two warm-season species were selected for an annual forage <b>stockpiling</b> trial. Cool-season perennial stands yielded higher but had lower quality in a relatively dry and cool growing season compared with the stands that experienced a warm and wet summer. Early <b>stockpile</b> initiation resulted in longer accumulation period and significantly higher (P < 0. 05) regrowth yield compared with late <b>stockpile</b> initiation. <b>Stockpiled</b> dry matter yield ranged from 1. 5 to 3. 6 Mg ha- 1 with meadow brome [(Bromus riparius Rehm.) cv. Fleet], mixed with alfalfa [(Medicago sativa L.) cv. Algonquin] having the highest production. Meadow brome and tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) in mixed stands with legumes had significantly higher production than pure stands of cicer milkvetch (Astragalus Cicer L.) and orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) as well as mixed stands of hybrid brome [(Bromus inermis Leyss. x Bromus riparius Rehm.) cv. Success (S) ] and cicer milkvetch (Astragalus Cicer L.). The latter three together with both pure alfalfa stands failed to meet the minimum <b>stockpiled</b> yield requirement for winter <b>stockpiling</b> of forage species. Tall fescue stands had the highest <b>stockpiled</b> yield among all pure stands. Late <b>stockpile</b> initiation provided more nutritious forage than the earlier initiation, however, the nutritive value of all species was adequate for a variety of grazing animals in different production stages regardless of the <b>stockpile</b> initiation date. Warm-season annuals generally exhibited higher <b>stockpiled</b> dry matter production than cool-season annuals.

40|$|Both {{researchers}} and managers {{have suggested that}} price promotion-induced <b>stockpiling</b> can increase a household’s usage frequency of a product. Empirical evidence of any <b>stockpiling</b> effect, however, is mixed. In reconciling the inconsistent findings of these empirical studies, this paper shows that <b>stockpiling</b> only increases a person’s usage of a product when that person has highly salient thoughts of the product. This model and these findings have critical implications for the advertising versus promotion debate.

40|$|Following the {{dismantling}} of a price-support program, a central bureaucracy is left with a commodity <b>stockpile</b> to dispose. It happened with wheat and feed grains in the U. S. in 1986 and wool in Australia in 1991. It soon may happen in Europe with grains, manufactured dairy products and other commodities which have supported prices. Obvious policies include privatising the <b>stockpile,</b> disposing of the <b>stockpile</b> by a central bureaucracy and quarantining the <b>stockpile</b> from the market. Each policy imposes constraints on disposal based, perhaps, on judgments of political acceptability to producers and government. In this article, optimal rules for production and disposal are derived and solved and a new policy is proposed. Then the model {{is applied to the}} disposal of Australia's wool <b>stockpile.</b> Results show that centralised disposal will almost always be preferred to privatisation of the <b>stockpile.</b> Centralised disposal is also preferred to quarantining the <b>stockpile</b> if interest rates are high, but quarantining is preferred if interest rates are low. Centralised disposal and quarantining are not optimal, however. Optimal production and disposal combines the efficiency of privatisation with the market power of centralised disposal. To achieve this, the property rights to the <b>stockpile</b> can be redefined using payment-in-kind certificates and individual transferable entitlements. The payment-in-kind certificates assign ownership of the <b>stockpile</b> to individual producers who then make both production and disposal decisions.

40|$|This audit {{assessed}} {{the effectiveness of}} the Department of Health’s management of the National Medical <b>Stockpile.</b> Audit objective, criteria and scope The audit objective was to assess {{the effectiveness of the}} Department of Health’s management of the National Medical <b>Stockpile.</b> To assist in evaluating the department’s performance in terms of the audit objective, the ANAO developed the following high level criteria: 	the Department of Health has sound governance arrangements in place for the management of the <b>Stockpile,</b> including an integrated and systematic approach to risk management and performance reporting; 	the Department of Health’s procurement and contract management arrangements for the <b>Stockpile</b> demonstrate a focus on getting the right outcomes and achieving value for money; 	the <b>Stockpile’s</b> inventory management system reflects value for money—it provides an assurance that the right items in the correct amount are being purchased, and stored appropriately, until they are either deployed, or they are disposed of on expiry; and 	the deployment plans and processes provide a high level of assurance that the <b>Stockpile</b> can be reliably deployed within agreed timeframes to agreed locations. The ANAO did not assess processes for the disposal or destruction of expired stock. While the audit examined aspects of the deployment strategy for the <b>Stockpile,</b> it did not seek to assess Australia’s general preparedness to respond to a national health emergency. Nor did the audit assess the clinical efficacy of <b>stockpiled</b> items. An ANAO performance audit in 2007 – 08 on Australia’s pandemic preparedness concluded that the <b>Stockpile</b> was established without high level planning, assessment of risks and an appropriate management framework. The ANAO recommended a shift from a short term ‘supply and store’ strategy for the <b>Stockpile</b> to a longer term management strategy. The current audit was not intended to assess implementation of all the earlier audit recommendations. However, {{in the course of the}} audit the ANAO considered the extent to which the Department of Health has implemented recommendations relating to the <b>Stockpile.</b> Overall conclusion The maintenance of the National Medical <b>Stockpile</b> (the <b>Stockpile)</b> since 2002 represents a significant government investment in the nation’s preparedness for public health emergencies resulting from terrorist activities or natural causes such as pandemics; with over $ 750  million allocated for the <b>Stockpile</b> in the past decade. In 2012 – 13 the <b>Stockpile</b> comprised 42 products and over 110  million items, with a reported value of almost $ 196  million. The effective management of this large strategic reserve, comprising pharmaceuticals and personal protective equipment with a limited shelf life, relies on planning and administrative arrangements geared to: select and procure appropriate items; warehouse and control the stock; and deal with expiring items. Effective deployment arrangements are also required to augment state and territory reserves of items from the <b>Stockpile</b> in a timely manner. Overall, the Department of Health’s management of the National Medical <b>Stockpile</b> has been generally effective in recent years, benefiting from improvements introduced since 2010. There remains scope, however, for improving the department’s strategic framework, operational management and deployment arrangements for the <b>Stockpile.</b> Since 2007, when the ANAO concluded that the department had not developed an appropriate framework for managing the <b>Stockpile,</b> the Department of Health has implemented a more structured management approach, including: the development of strategic and operational risk management plans in 2010; the rationalisation of previously fragmented storage contracts in 2010; the application of an evidence‑based approach for the selection of appropriate <b>stockpile</b> items; and the maintenance of formal deployment arrangements with states and territories. Strategies have also been adopted or examined for the cost‑effective replenishment and disposal of expired <b>stockpile</b> items. However, there remains scope for improving key elements of the department’s management arrangements, including: updating the strategic and operational risk management plans; clarifying aspects of the storage contracts to strengthen reporting and performance monitoring; improving the integrity of data used to manage the stockpile; and planning to test <b>Stockpile</b> deployment arrangements. Key issues relating to the <b>Stockpile’s</b> strategic framework, operational management and deployment are discussed in the following paragraphs. The department adopted a more strategic approach to the <b>Stockpile’s</b> management with the introduction of a strategic plan in 2010, albeit some eight years after the <b>Stockpile</b> was established. While the plan broadly describes the governance, funding and administrative arrangements for the <b>Stockpile,</b> it should be updated to identify objectives, priorities and strategies for the <b>Stockpile’s</b> management—key elements of a strategic plan. High level outcomes for the <b>Stockpile</b> agreed to in 2011 by the then Government should also be reflected in an updated plan. Operational management of the <b>Stockpile</b> benefited from the introduction of an operational risk management plan in 2010, which should be updated to reflect risks identified in the Department of Finance’s 2011 Strategic Review of the <b>Stockpile.</b> Operational management was further improved with the consolidation of warehousing arrangements into two longer‑term contracts with logistics firms, relating to pharmaceutical items and personal protective equipment. However, management reports have not been regularly provided, as required under the contracts, and the department should clarify reporting obligations. Further, there is scope to address weaknesses in some system controls and shortcomings in manual processing, which have contributed to the emergence of data integrity issues such as discrepancies between information held in the <b>Stockpile</b> database and warehouse system records. The department has developed a deployment framework with states and territories, although these arrangements have not been recently tested. To provide assurance that deployment arrangements will be effective in a national health emergency, the department should undertake planning to test deployment arrangements, in consultation with other jurisdictions. While there remains scope for further improvement as indicated above, the department’s work in recent years demonstrates a more active approach to management of the <b>Stockpile,</b> as does the recent focus on the findings of the 2011 Strategic Review. The ANAO has made four recommendations aimed at improving the effectiveness of the department’s management of the <b>Stockpile,</b> by: improving strategic planning and risk management; enhancing performance reporting by contractors; reviewing information management arrangements; and planning to test deployment arrangements...|$|R
