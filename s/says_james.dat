6000|$|I {{would accept}} {{in a more}} {{stringent}} sense than it was probably intended to bear, the text of St. James, who wrote {{at a time when}} a vast variety and multitude of animals were constantly being forwarded to Rome and to Antioch for amphitheatrical shows.

'The Duke perceiving' (from Godfrey's {{information}} of September 28) 'Oates had named Coleman, bade him look to himself, {{for he was}} sure to find no favour, and therefore, {{if he had any}} papers that might hurt him, to secure them immediately; but he, apprehending no danger, let them be seized, however kept close himself, and sent to advise with the Duke whether he should deliver himself up or not. The Duke replyd, [...] "He knew best what was in his papers; if they contain'd any expression which could be wrested to an ill sence, he had best not appear, otherwise the surrendering himself would be an argument of innocency." [...] He did accordingly,' and was condemned in November, and hanged.* ...|$|E
60|$|To be short, what says Paul in {{the seventh}} to the Romans? what <b>says</b> <b>James</b> in the third chapter of his epistle? (ch. 3:2) And what says John in his first epistle, and first chapter? (1 John 1:9) Do they not all confess, though {{themselves}} were apostles, and so for grace and gifts beyond any that breathe in this world, that sin and iniquity was yet with them; and so consequently, {{that there was not}} as yet that departing by them therefrom, as there should. And the reason, as I have said, is, because grace is weak, weak in the beat and most strong of the saints of God. Hence the greatest saints use to complain, when much assaulted with corruptions, or attended with very hard service for God, of their weakness and insufficiency, as to a completeness of doing the will of God.|$|E

60|$|To {{return to}} James’s own narrative, he asserts Henderson’s {{presence}} at Falkland, {{but not from}} his own knowledge. He did not see Henderson at Falkland. Ruthven, <b>says</b> <b>James,</b> sent Henderson to Gowrie just after the King mounted and followed the hounds. Here {{it must be noted}} that Henderson himself says that Ruthven did not actually despatch him till after he had some more words with the King. This is an instance of James’s insouciance as to harmonising his narrative with Henderson’s, or causing Henderson to conform to his. ‘Cooked’ evidence, collusive evidence, would have avoided these discrepancies. James says that, musing over the story of the pot of gold, he sent one Naismith, a surgeon (he had been with James at least since 1592), to bring Ruthven to him, during a check, and told Ruthven that he would, after the hunt, come to Perth. James thought that this was after the despatch of Henderson, but probably it was before, to judge by Henderson’s account.|$|E
6000|$|The trussing, {{for which}} the demipique saddle of the day afforded {{particular}} facility, is alluded to in the text; and the author, among other nickcnacks of antiquity, possesses a leathern flask, like those carried by sportsmen, which is labelled, [...] "King James's Hunting Bottle," [...] with what authenticity is uncertain. Coke seems to have exaggerated the King's taste for the bottle. Welldon <b>says</b> <b>James</b> was not intemperate in his drinking; [...] "However, in his old age, Buckingham's jovial suppers, when he had any turn to do with him, made him sometimes overtaken, which he would the next day remember, and repent with tears. It is true he drank very often, which was rather out of a custom than any delight; and his drinks were of that kind for strength, as Frontiniack, Canary, high country wine, tent wine, and Scottish ale, that had he not {{had a very strong}} brain, he might have been daily overtaken, though he seldom drank at any one time above four spoonfuls, many times not above one or two."--Secret History of King James, vol. ii., p. 3. Edin. 1811.|$|E
60|$|Gondomar offered, <b>says</b> <b>James,</b> to let Raleigh go {{with one}} or two ships only. He might work a mine, and the King of Spain would give him a safe convoy home with all his gold. How kind. And how likely would Raleigh and his fellow-adventurers have been to accept such an offer; how likely, too, to find men who would sail with them on such an errand, to be 'flayed alive,' as many who {{travelled}} to the Indies of late years had been, or to have their throats cut, tied back to back, after trading unarmed and peaceably for a month, as thirty-six of Raleigh's men had been but two or three years before in that very Orinoco. So James is forced to let the large fleet go; and to let it go well armed also; for the plain reason, that otherwise it dare not go at all; and in the meanwhile letters are sent from Spain, in which the Spaniards call the fleet 'English enemies,' and ships and troops are moved up as fast as possible from the Spanish main.|$|E
50|$|At {{the age of}} 19, James {{was killed}} in a water skiing {{accident}} near Echuca on New Years Day 1990. He had been skiing with two friends on the Murray River and was flung into a tree. Wheeler, his former coach at Williamstown, had joined Footscray for the 1990 AFL season and was later quoted as <b>saying</b> <b>James</b> could have been a 150 or 200 game player.|$|R
50|$|Accounts <b>say</b> that <b>James</b> {{surrendered}} {{with the}} understanding {{that he would not be}} extradited to Northfield, Minnesota.|$|R
60|$|But, <b>say</b> some, <b>James</b> was {{justified}} in telling Gondomar, and the Spaniards in defending themselves. On the latter point {{there is no}} doubt.|$|R
6000|$|But further, let us {{take notice}} of the comparison. [...] "As a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him." [...] Here is not only pity, but the pity of a relation, a father. It is said in another place; [...] "Can a woman," [...] a mother, [...] "forget her sucking child, that she should not have {{compassion}} on the son of her womb? yea, they may, yet will not I forget thee." [...] The pity of neighbours and acquaintance helpeth in times of distress, but the pity of {{a father and a}} mother is pity with an over and above. [...] "The Lord," [...] <b>says</b> <b>James,</b> [...] "is very pitiful, and of tender mercy." [...] Pharaoh called Joseph his tender father,[21] because he provided for him against the famine, but how tender a father is God! how full of bowels! how full of pity! (James 5:11; Gen 41:43). It is said, that when Ephraim was afflicted, God's bowels were troubled for him, and turned within him towards him. O that the man that feareth the Lord did but believe the pity and bowels that are in the heart of God and his father towards him (Jer 31:18-20).|$|E
6000|$|James {{occupied}} {{the time of}} Ruthven’s absence in asking {{the man of the}} turret what he knew of the conspiracy. The man replied that he knew nothing, he had but recently been locked into the little chamber. Indeed, while Ruthven was threatening, the man (<b>says</b> <b>James)</b> was trembling, and adjuring the Master not to harm the King. James, having sworn to Ruthven that he would not open the window himself, now, characteristically, asked the man to open the window ‘on his right hand.’ If the King had his back to the turret door, the window on his right opened on the courtyard, the window on his left opened on the street. The man readily opened the window, says the King, and the person claiming to be the man deponed later that he first opened what the King declared to be the wrong window, but, before he could open the other, in came the Master, who, ‘casting his hands abroad in desperate manner, said “he could not mend it, his Majesty behoved to die.”’ Instead of stabbing James, however, he tried to bind the Royal hands with a garter, ‘swearing he behoved to be bound.’ (A garter was later picked up on the floor by one of the witnesses, Graham of Balgonie, and secured by Sir Thomas Erskine. {58}) ...|$|E
6000|$|Now, {{since this}} is so, there is no less lies at stake than {{salvation}}, and salvation is worth all the world, yea, worth ten thousand worlds, if there should be so many. And {{since this is}} so also, it will be your wisdom to begin to profess the gospel with expectation of the cross and tribulation, for to that are my gospellers1 in this world appointed (James 1:12; 1 Thess 3:3). And if you begin thus, and hold it, the kingdom and crown shall be yours; for as God counteth it a righteous thing to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you, so to you who are troubled and endure it, for 'we count them happy,' <b>says</b> <b>James,</b> 'that endure,' (James 5:11), rest with saints, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with His mighty angels in flaming fire, to take vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel, etc. (2 Thess 1:7, 8). And if no less lies at stake than salvation, then is a man's soul and his all at the stake; and if it be so, what will it profit a man if, by forsaking of Me, he should get the whole world? 'For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?' ...|$|E

6000|$|As he well asks afterwards, 'If the King did {{not think}} that Guiana was his, why let me go thither at all? He knows that it was his by the law of nations, for he made Mr. Harcourt a grant of part of it. If it be, as Gondomar says, the King of Spain's, then I had no more right to work a mine in it than to burn a town.' An {{argument}} which seems to me unanswerable. But, <b>says</b> <b>James,</b> and others with him, he was forbid to meddle with any country occupate or possessed by Spaniards. Southey, too, blames him severely for not having told James that the country was already settled by Spaniards. I can excuse Southey, but not James, for overlooking the broad fact that all England knew it, as I have shown, since 1594; that if they did not, Gondomar would have taken care to tell them; and that he could not go to Guiana without meddling with Spaniards. His former voyages and publications made no secret of it. On the contrary, one chief argument for the plan had been all through the delivery of the Indians from these very Spaniards, who, though they could not conquer them, ill-used them in every way: and in his agreement with the Lords about the Guiana voyage in 1611, he makes especial mention of the very place which will soon fill such a part in our story, 'San Thome, where the Spaniards inhabit,' and tells the Lords whom to ask as to the number of men who will be wanted 'to secure Keymish's passage to the mine' against these very Spaniards. What can be more clear, save to those who will not see? ...|$|E
