60|$|I asked her, {{and looked}} curiously at her, because <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> curiously at me.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> {{genuinely}} disturbed, and so tenderly appealing, that {{he could}} not help but obey.|$|E
60|$|Aline, meantime, {{inside the}} room, {{had begun to}} draw comfort from Joan's very appearance, <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> capable.|$|E
5000|$|Your Mother Wears Army Boots, But Man <b>She</b> <b>Looks</b> <b>So</b> Cool (1996) ...|$|R
2500|$|Que linda ela est√°! = [...] "Wow, <b>she's</b> <b>looking</b> <b>so</b> beautiful" [...] (state) ...|$|R
5000|$|... 5 {{seconds of}} summer - <b>She</b> <b>Looks</b> <b>So</b> Perfect (Official Beef Seeds Cover) ...|$|R
60|$|She {{stopped to}} hear his {{response}} to that, and <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> cold that it almost froze on Gavin's lips.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> very {{desirable}} as {{she smiled}} at him that Borden almost groaned. She patted his hand and changed the conversation.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> frail {{that he was}} frightened. Surely, too, she'd be {{very angry}} with him for letting her come on this jaunt.|$|E
60|$|JAMES. I mind them fine; {{she began}} them for William Cathro. She's getting on in years, too, though <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>so</b> young.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{only speak}} of it as relative. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>so</b> well--and somehow so 'fine.' Why else shouldn't we have {{recognised}} her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh yes; poor child, <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>so</b> {{pale and}} miserable. We {{are going to}} Mrs Sherwin's, {{and then on to}} Church. You will lock your door?' ...|$|R
60|$|If Arthur was red, Fanny, on the contrary, {{was very}} worn and pale. Arthur remarked it, and asked kindly why <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> fatigued.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{been gone}} long, doctor," [...] said Rand feverishly, [...] "and <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>SO</b> death-like when I left. If {{we should be}} too late!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> {{beautiful}} in the purity of her faith in this lost man, that her husband could have looked {{at her as she}} was for hours.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah!' said Fly, with {{a tender}} little shake of her head; ''tis worse {{for her to}} have no mother at all! Is that why <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>so</b> sad?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I should {{advise you}} to try {{something}} else. I shouldn't know what {{to talk to your}} sister about; <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>so</b> different. Is that silver cross a badge?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mamma {{does not}} mention her in her last letter, but poor Ida is really much more {{delicate}} than one would think, though <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>so</b> strong. This would be delightful!' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> {{beautiful}} in her enthusiasm that I nearly {{brought down the}} whole level of the interview. I gripped myself hard, and went on with the argument.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> pitiful and {{pleading}} in {{her white}} nightgown against the shadowy lumber-hole that he was quite worried. She continued to beseech him not to disturb her.|$|E
60|$|She stirred herself, {{put back}} the curtain, and I saw her face, pale, wasted, but quite composed: <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> little changed that my fear was {{instantly}} dissipated.|$|E
6000|$|... "And--and--did <b>she</b> <b>look</b> <b>so</b> {{much like}} me?" [...] she said, with an added laugh, that he {{perceived}} had an hysterical note in it. [...] "You're letting your rarebit get cold!" ...|$|R
60|$|It made a {{great many}} smile; and no wonder, when you {{consider}} what a gentle and innocent little thing <b>she</b> <b>looked.</b> One could hardly believe she had ever even seen men slaughtered, <b>she</b> <b>look</b> <b>so</b> little fitted for such things.|$|R
6000|$|But let {{the cause}} {{be what it}} will, [...] In half a month <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>so</b> thin, That Flamsteed[3] can, with all his skill, [...] See but her {{forehead}} and her chin.|$|R
6000|$|Grace {{said little}} on her entrance, {{but her eyes}} were {{brighter}} than usual, and <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> contented and happy that Emily observed to her, in an affectionate manner-- ...|$|E
60|$|Harding laughed. He {{loved her}} in that mood. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> {{alluring}} with a little frown between her brows and just the suspicion of a pout on her lips.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] Joan answered. [...] "I was too late. She {{had died}} the night before. I hardly {{recognized}} her when I saw her. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> sweet and young." ...|$|E
6000|$|Murray {{crossed over}} to the paling rather grumpily. He {{did not want to}} talk with Mollie Booth just then. Confound it, what did the girl want? Why was <b>she</b> <b>looking</b> <b>so</b> mysterious? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose a}} man would never think of trying the obvious places first," [...] she replied. [...] "Hastings, don't you see that poor old woman over there? <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>so</b> thirsty--give her this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{only going}} to pay the one that I engaged," [...] said Rollo; [...] "but, poor thing, I mean to give her two coppers, instead of one, <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>so</b> sick and miserable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought it}} was so nice. And <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> very well. And he was so pleasant, and so much like a gentleman;--not noisy, you know,--and yet not too serious." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> steadfastly at me: {{with a kind}} of doubt, or pity, or {{suspense}} in her affection: that I {{summoned the}} stronger determination to show her a perfectly cheerful face.|$|E
60|$|Every {{trace of}} her dimples had vanished. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>so</b> sweetly grave, and withal so maidenly, sitting there {{slightly}} smoothing the lengths of her pink fingers, that Herbert was somewhat embarrassed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} I can't sing to-day, Fritz. I am very unhappy about mamma. <b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>so</b> anxious and so ill; and when I ask what is troubling her, she puts me {{off with an}} excuse." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I like her, <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>so</b> {{fresh and}} pleasant, and so strong. I {{just wanted to}} go and lean up against her, when my back ached yesterday," [...] {{answered}} Maud, a pale girl wrapped in a shawl.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} {{the best thing for}} Sister Mena would be to go to a good school, leave off her veil, in which <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>so</b> pretty, and be treated like an {{ordinary}} girl," [...] said Lady Merrifield.|$|R
