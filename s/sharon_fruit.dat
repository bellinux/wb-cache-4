Cross-reactivity with pollen (profilin and Bet v 6) {{appeared}} to be involved, but Bet v 1 has not been implicated previously. OBJECTIVE: It is our aim to identify whether Bet v 1 sensitization is linked to <b>sharon</b> <b>fruit</b> allergy. METHODS: Two patients with a reaction upon first exposure to <b>sharon</b> <b>fruit</b> {{were included in the}} study, as well as 7 patients with birch-pollen-related apple allergy. Sensitivity was assessed by skin prick testing (SPT), a radio-allergosorbent test (RAST) and immunoblotting. RAST analysis was performed for Bet v 1, Bet v 2 and Bet v 6. Cross-reactivity was evaluated by RAST and immunoblot inhibitions. Biological activity of IgE was measured by basophil histamine release. <b>Sharon</b> <b>fruit</b> allergy was evaluated by double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) or open challenge (OC). RESULTS: Both sharon-fruit-allergic patients demonstrated positive reactions in the RAST (8. 6 and 6. 2 IU/ml, respectively) and SPT (wheal area 37 and 36 mm 2). <b>Sharon</b> <b>fruit</b> allergy was confirmed by DBPCFC in 1 patient. The second patient refused a challenge because of the severe initial reaction. Sera from both patients were reactive to Bet v 1 and Bet v 6, which was cross-reactive with <b>sharon</b> <b>fruit</b> by inhibition assays. The patient with the severest reactions was reactive to profilin on immunoblotting. However, profilin did not induce significant histamine release, nor did Bet v 6. Bet v 1 induce approximately 60 % histamine release. An OC with <b>sharon</b> <b>fruit</b> in 7 patients allergic to birch pollen and apple, who had not eaten <b>sharon</b> <b>fruit</b> previously, was positive in 6 / 7 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Birch-pollen-related allergy to <b>sharon</b> <b>fruit</b> is mediated by the known cross-reactive pollen allergens including Bet v 1 and may become more of a problem should <b>sharon</b> <b>fruit</b> consumption increas...|$|E

Water vapor permeability, oxygen permeability, tensile strength and percentage {{elongation at break}} at different water activities (aw) were measured. Films with low amounts of glycerol had lower water vapor and oxygen permeabilities, higher tensile strength and lower elongation at break. Wheat gluten coatings reduced weight loss during two weeks of storage for cherry tomatoes and <b>sharon</b> <b>fruits</b> compared to uncoated controls. A bilayer film of wheat gluten and beeswax significantly lowered weight loss from coated cheese cubes compared to single layer coating of wheat gluten. ...|$|R
