This paper aims {{to get the}} {{kinematic}} {{performance and}} control parameters of moving mooring marine current turbine system such as velocity, period of motion, <b>speed</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>ratio,</b> motion trail, tension of cable, steerage and timing of control, strength of the platform and etc. This article first gets the hydrodynamic parameters with CFD and then builds the equations of motion, and the system simulation test was carried out with Matlab and Adams. The result shows that this moving mooring marine current turbine system can move on a designed trajectory by steering in flow environment. The velocity of the platform is about six to eight times to the current speed. The simulation lays a foundation {{for the development of}} engineering prototype. There have been plenty of information proved the theoretical breakthrough but we still need to face great challenge in the project practice in the coming future...|$|E

As vehicle <b>speeds</b> <b>increase,</b> the steering <b>ratio</b> <b>increases,</b> so it takes larger movements of the steering wheel to move the wheels and that lessens the usually increasing vehicle response resulting from <b>increased</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|R
50|$|As in many windmills, The Lily {{features}} {{two sets}} of gears between the sails and the millstones. The first one is between the brake wheel and the wallower which have 63 and 29 teeth respectively. The second gear is formed by the great spur wheel and the stone nut which have 66 and 23 teeth respectively. The number of teeth in each gear {{has been designed to}} be coprime to ensure even wear and smooth running of these gears. Both gears together provide a <b>speed</b> <b>increasing</b> gear <b>ratio</b> between sails and millstone of ≈6.2. This means that one complete revolution of the sails causes approximately 6.2 revolutions of the (top) millstone.|$|R

As can be observed in Table  2 and Fig.  10 (a), as the wind <b>speed</b> <b>increases,</b> the damping <b>ratio</b> (ξ = - α /√(α^ 2 + β^ 2)) or damping has a decreasing tendency. On the other hand, other oscillation modes in Table  2 are related to DFIG and ES controllers and are insignificantly affected by the wind speed.|$|R

They are typically based on aspect ratio i.e. the aspect ratio of element decide whether a particular element {{would be good to}} use or we should go for another element with different aspect ratio. For example, if the aspect ratio is large the speed of solver reduces while if this ratio is small the solver <b>speed</b> <b>increases.</b> Large aspect <b>ratio</b> has another limitation of leading to interpolation errors. But if the results vary with direction then we use large aspect ratio.|$|R

All configurations had cut-off sterns and all had equal base, frontal, and exposed fin areas.

40|$|The average {{velocity}} {{field at the}} pump–turbine interface in a scaled version of a truck torque converter was studied. Seven different turbine-to-pump rotational-speed ratios were examined, ranging from near stall (0. 065) to overspeed (1. 050) so as {{to determine the effect}} of the speed ratio on the flow field and on the mass flow rate. Laser velocimetry was used to measure the flow velocity through the pump's exit and the turbine's inlet plane. At the pump's exit, as the <b>speed</b> <b>ratio</b> <b>increases,</b> the high velocities move to the pressure-shell corner and then to both the core-suction and the pressureshell corners. Concentrated velocity gradients are largest at the lowest speed ratio, but areas of velocity gradients are largest near the coupling point. Near the coupling point, the flow field is most nonuniform, which yields a highly periodic flow into the turbine inlet. Above the coupling point, the high velocity remains in the pressure-shell corner but separation is seen to develop at the highest speed ratio. At the turbine's inlet, reverse flow is seen at low speed ratios and is an indicator of flow leakage through the core. Velocity gradients are very large at low speed ratios. As the <b>speed</b> <b>ratio</b> <b>increases</b> to the coupling point, the high velocities remain on the shell side. Above the coupling point, the high-velocity flow migrates from the shell side to the core side. The mass flow rate decreases significantly and nonlinearly with the <b>increase</b> of the <b>speed</b> <b>ratio,</b> but for speed ratios greater than 1. 000, the negative slope decreases...|$|R

40|$|The plasma {{environment}} of high altitude spacecraft was observed to involve ion drift velocities which sometimes become comparable to ion mean thermal speeds. Such drifts may cause an electrically isolated spacecraft surface to float at a substantially increased negative potential {{if it is}} simultaneously shaded and downstream relative to the drift direction. The results showed that: (1) the ion speed ratio at which drift effects become important (i. e. change the floating potential by at least 10 percent) can be as low as 0. 1, and may be decreased if the ambient electrons are non-Maxwellian; (2) the effects of ion <b>speed</b> <b>ratio</b> <b>increase</b> with increasing ion-to-electron temperature ratio; and (3) negative floating potentials for drifting Maxwellian ion velocity distributions with speed ratio unity are typically about {{twice as large as}} the corresponding potentials for nondrifting conditions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{illustrate}} the combustion characteristics of RP- 3 kerosene which is widely used in Chinese aero-engines, the combustion characteristics of RP- 3 kerosene were experimentally investigated in a constant volume combustion chamber. The experiments were performed at four different pressures of 0. 1 MPa, 0. 3 MPa, 0. 5 MPa and 0. 7 MPa, and three different temperatures of 390 K, 420 K and 450 K, and over the equivalence ratio range of 0. 6 – 1. 6. Furthermore, the laminar combustion speeds of a surrogate fuel for RP- 3 kerosene were simulated under certain conditions. The results show that increasing the initial temperature or decreasing the initial pressure causes {{an increase in the}} laminar combustion speed of RP- 3 kerosene. With the equivalence <b>ratio</b> <b>increasing</b> from 0. 6 to 1. 6, the laminar combustion <b>speed</b> <b>increases</b> initially and then decreases gradually. The highest laminar combustion speed is measured under fuel rich condition (the equivalence ratio is 1. 2). At the same time, the Markstein length shows the same changing trend as the laminar combustion speed with modification of the initial pressure. Increasing the initial pressure will increase the instability of the flame front, which is established by decreased Markstein length. However, different from the effects of the initial temperature and equivalence ratio on the laminar combustion <b>speed,</b> <b>increasing</b> the equivalence <b>ratio</b> will lead to a decrease in the Markstein length and the stability of the flame front, and the effect of the initial temperature on the Markstein length is unclear. Furthermore, the simulated laminar combustion speeds of the surrogate fuel agree with the corresponding experimental datas of RP- 3 kerosene within ∼ 10 % deviation under certain conditions...|$|R

This thesis investigated the relationship between total delay and stopped delay at signalized intersections. As the 1. 3 value used in the 1985 HCM was obtained empirically, an analytical model was developed to account for the relevant variables such as approach speeds and associated deceleration and acceleration rates. By studying the effects of the relevant parameters, the relationship between delay components was analyzed with respect to the different operating conditions at signalized intersections. The TRAF-NETSIM computer simulation program was used to provide reference values for the results from the analytical model under the same operating conditions. Actual traffic delay data were collected in the field to validate the model's results. Statistical analysis was used as an important tool to achieve this goal. The results from this study indicated that the ratio of total delay to stopped delay was not a constant as the operating conditions changed. Specifically, as approach <b>speed</b> <b>increased,</b> this delay <b>ratio</b> <b>increased</b> when other parameters were assigned reasonable values. A similar trend was observed from the field measurements. The reason for this phenomenon is that higher deceleration or acceleration rates are generally used by most drivers to decelerate from or accelerate to higher speeds,thus changing the composition of total delay. In conclusion, the ratio of total delay to stopped delay should not be treated as a constant and should be calculated using an appropriate model...|$|R
40|$|Stopping and {{accelerating}} at {{traffic lights}} {{is one of}} the main contributing factors to vehicular emissions in urban environments. The work in this paper demonstrates a generic guideline for minimizing CO 2 emissions at traffic lights. This was done using an adaptive control, which uses a cost function for optimization, rather than network-specific control parameters. A new version of the emission model PHEMlight was used, which added of a fuel cut-off mode during coasting and other improvements compared to the previous version. Using this model, it could be determined that the emission optimal ratio between delay time and stops for the cost function of an adaptive control should be 1 : 165 at 50 km/h. When the <b>speed</b> limit <b>increases</b> the <b>ratio</b> also <b>increases</b> with 1 : 296 for 70 km/h. However, it was also found that the optimal free flow travel speed was around 70 km/h. Therefore with long distances between intersections and a low amount of average stops, the maximum speed should be higher than 50 km/h for emission optimality. Application of the ratio for 50 km/h to the adaptive control algorithm ImFlow resulted in a CO 2 emission reduction of 6. 3 % compared to a vehicle actuated control...|$|R
40|$|Concentric {{rotating}} cylinder and turbulent mixing devices have been frequently used in studying mixing and particle coagulation. However, these apparatus develop simple laminar flow (concentric {{rotating cylinder}}s) {{or do not}} have well-defined flow (turbulent mixing devices). In this work, the eccentric rotating cylinder apparatus was investigated to find applicability for the improved study of coagulation based on the modified analytical solution of Ballal and Rivlin. Various eccentricity ratios, rotation speeds and viscosities were simulated to obtain optimum operating conditions. Inertial forces working on the fluid increased as the eccentricity <b>ratio</b> and rotation <b>speed</b> <b>increase.</b> As inertial forces increase, the eddy developed in wide clearance was more skewed {{in the direction of}} rotation. Both root-mean-square velocity gradient and average principal strain-rate, were increased by <b>increasing</b> eccentricity <b>ratio.</b> avaerage principal strain-rate were linearly <b>increased</b> as rotation <b>speed</b> <b>increases,</b> which suggested that average prinipal strain-rate can properly represent mixing intensity. Comparison of average principal strain-rate and RMS velocity gradient revealed that RMS velocity gradient overestimated mixing intensity and its error <b>increased</b> as eccentricity <b>ratio</b> <b>increases.</b> This study showed that the eccentric rotating cylinder apparatus has a non-uniform velocity distribution with well-defined fluid dynamics. Therefore, the eccentric rotating cylinder apparatus can be applicable as a model flocculator.

40|$|A four-bladed, squirrel-cage, and scaled {{vertical}} kinetic turbine was designed, instrumented {{and tested}} in the water tunnel facilities at the University of Manitoba. With a solidity of 1. 3 and NACA 0021 blade profile, the turbine is classified as a high solidity model. Results were obtained for conditions during freewheeling at various Reynolds numbers. In this study, the freewheeling tip speed ratio, which relates the ratio of maximum blade speed to the free stream velocity at no load, was divided into three regions based on the Reynolds number. At low Reynolds numbers, the tip speed ratio was lower than unity and blades were in a stall condition. At {{the end of the}} first region, there was a sharp increase of the tip speed ratio so the second region has a tip speed ratio significantly higher than unity. In this region, the tip <b>speed</b> <b>ratio</b> <b>increases</b> almost linearly with Reynolds number. At high Reynolds numbers, the tip speed ratio is almost independent of Reynolds number in the third region.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} study, the {{relationships}} between friction stir welding parameters and the tensile behavior of Al 2024 -T 4 joints was investigated. The aluminum alloy plates were butt-welded using a hardened steel tool with a threaded and fluted cylindrical pin at various tool rotation speed to advancing speed ratios. Metallographic observations, EDS analysis and microhardness measurements show that the band spacing in the periodic microstructure of the stir zone and the average microhardness of this region decrease with <b>increasing</b> <b>speed</b> <b>ratio.</b> Tensile ductility is strongly affected by welding parameters and final elongation <b>increases</b> significantly with <b>speed</b> <b>ratio</b> at the constant rotating speed of 900 rpm. This behavior {{is found to be}} associated with a change in tensile fracture location. Formation of microscopic voids at low speed ratios leads to premature fracture in the nugget zone, while in the defect-free joints produced at higher speed ratios the fracture location shifts into the HAZ on the retreating side, which exhibits the lowest microhardness value within the weld joint. At the optimum rotation speed of 900 rpm and speed ratio of 11. 2 rev/mm the tensile strength and final elongation of the joints are equivalent to 97 % and 77 % that of base metal, respectively...|$|R

40|$|Fast amoeboid {{migration}} requires {{cells to}} apply mechanical forces on their surroundings via transient adhesions. However, the role these forces play in controlling cell migration speed remains largely unknown. We use three- dimensional force microscopy {{to examine the}} mechanics underlying the chemotactic migration of wild-type Dictyostelium cells, as well as mutant strains with defects in contractility, internal F-actin cross-linking and cortical integrity. We show that cells pull on their substrate adhesions using two distinct, yet interconnected mechanisms: axial actomyosin contractility and cortical tension. The three-dimensional pulling forces generated by both mechanisms are internally balanced {{by an increase in}} cytoplasmic pressure that allows cells to push on their substrate downward without adhering to it. These compressive pressure-induced forces are not associated to adhesion sites, and may allow amoeboid cells to push off surrounding structures when migrating in complex three- dimensional environments. We find a relationship between the strength of these three-dimensional forces and the migration speed and we show that the cell migration <b>speed</b> <b>increases</b> with the <b>ratio</b> of the tangential to normal forces. This finding indicates that the migration <b>speed</b> <b>increases</b> when axial contractility balances cortical tension, allowing the cells to modulate their three- dimensional shape and move faster. Additionally, we develop a new methodology for the calculation of the three -dimensional forces exerted by migrating cells improved by a Lagrange multipliers optimization that provides a stress field in equilibrium and equal to zero outside the region in which the cell is localized. Furthermore, we design a novel elastometry technique based on the exact solution of the elastic equation of equilibrium, the measurement of the deformation exerted by cells when moving and the application of an optimization algorithm for solving a non -linear least-squares problem. This novel method enables the characterization of the Poisson ratio of polymer-based substrates on real time, which is essential for a precise calculation of the traction forces. The value of the Poisson ratio that we obtain for the polyacrylamide gels used in our experiments is 0. 45. A similar methodology could be applied to calculate the mechanical properties and constitutive equations for other extracellular environments, which are not perfectly elasti...|$|R
