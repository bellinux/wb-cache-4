5|$|Shortly {{after the}} family arrive at their new house in Cypress Creek, they meet Homer's new boss, Hank Scorpio, {{who is very}} amiable and <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> perfect boss. After giving Homer {{a tour of the}} company, Scorpio tells him that his job is to motivate the {{employees}} in the nuclear division. Meanwhile, Bart starts school, but he finds that his new class is far above the standards of Springfield Elementary. When his teacher discovers that Bart cannot read cursive writing, he places him in a remedial class, much to Bart's shock. Lisa goes for a nature walk and discovers that she is allergic to all of the plants around Cypress Creek. Marge tries to go about her daily chores, but the house does everything automatically. This ends up depressing her to the point where Marge starts drinking wine to cope. However, Homer does an excellent job motivating his team in the nuclear division, which makes his family very proud of him.|$|E
5|$|The {{stranding}} of the Northern bottlenose whale mainly {{happens in}} two {{villages in the}} northern part of Suðuroy: Hvalba and Sandvík. It is believed that it happens because of a navigation problem of the whale, because there are isthmuses on these places, where the distance between the east and west coasts are short, around one kilometer or so. And for some reason it <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> bottlenose whale want to take a short cut through what it thinks is a sound, and too late it discovers, that is on shallow ground and is unable to turn around again. It happened on 30 August 2012, when two Northern bottlenose whales swam ashore to the gorge Sigmundsgjógv in Sandvík. Two men who were working on the harbour noticed these whales, and some time later they had either died by themselves or were killed by the locals and then cut up for food for the people of Sandvík and Hvalba (Hvalba municipality).|$|E
5|$|Tired of his high-priced {{imported}} livestock {{losing in}} local shows, Glure concocts a dog {{show with a}} special gold cup event that is limited to collies that are both American Kennel Club blue ribbon winners and capable of completing the tasks of a British working sheep dog trial. Initially, it <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> only dog who meets the requirements is Glure's recently purchased blue-merle champion, Lochinvar III; however, the Mistress is able to command Lad {{through the motions of}} the trial. Lochinvar works primarily by hand signal, so when Glure accidentally burns his fingers on his cigar while going through the trial, the dog stops working and waits for Glure's hand-shaking to be explained. The dog is disqualified and Lad is declared the winner. The Master and Mistress donate the gold cup to the Red Cross in his name.|$|E

Chang based these thoughts on a skull found in Sichuan and a skull found in Guangxi.|$|R

25|$|In 2017, a reboot of the 'Charlie's Angels film franchise' {{is planned}} {{with a new}} 'Charlie's Angels film' - this time Sony Pictures Entertainment has elected to put American actress, director, and {{producer}} Elizabeth Banks in the director's chair. Banks - who produced and then directed the enormously successful female-centric Pitch Perfect franchise - <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> natural fit for a freshly empowered take on the 1970s Charlie's Angels TV formula. As The Hollywood Reporter first broke back in September, Banks will also produce the upcoming film with partner and husband Max Handelman. In April 2016, Banks signed up to direct {{a revival of the}} classic Charlie's Angels TV series.|$|E
25|$|Along the African coast {{you will}} hear that dirge-like strain in all their songs, as at work or {{paddling}} their canoes to and from shore, they keep time to the music. On the southern plantations {{you will hear}} it also, and in the negro melodies every where, plaintive and melodious, sad and earnest. It <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> dirge of national degradation, the wail of a race, stricken and crushed, familiar with tyranny, submission and unrequited labor… And here I cannot help noticing the similarity existing between the working chorus of the sailors and the dirge-like negro melody, to which my attention was specially directed by an incident I witnessed or rather heard.|$|E
25|$|The overall {{forms of}} this {{structure}} can be simply {{described as a}} larger box sitting on top a smaller box with a central void (the atrium) connecting the two forms together. Looking at the profile of this building from afar, it <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> large seven-story block is held up solely by the series of columns. The lower block is completely transparent, thus the definition of that space is lost when the building is viewed from a distance. The facades of this building are very planar, and its overall form is very geometrical and rectilinear. Stretching along the vertical axis, this building is bi-laterally symmetrical. Made almost entirely of glass, the building facades are very planar yet sophisticated. The only contrast to its smooth, sleek, glass façade is the soft, round, colossal columns which the larger box sits atop of and the large organic orbs which float inside the atrium.|$|E

25|$|On 11 March Gripenberg {{suggested}} truce of {{six weeks}} which the Russians Major General Muchanoff promptly rejected but agreed for a truce of {{three days after}} which hostilities would continue anew. Gripenberg agreed to a surrender on 14 March before the truce had run out. On 17 March Russian General commanding the armies in Finland, Friedrich Wilhelm von Buxhoeveden, accepted the surrender. Swedes surrendered the fortress with all its weapons intact to the Russians who in turn agreed just to dismiss the mostly Finnish garrison of Svartholm. The reasons for the capitulation are somewhat unclear but it <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Swedish officers didn't believe in the Swedish capability, nor the fortress' capability to withstand the Russians in this war. As {{many of the other}} Swedish officers, Gripenberg entered Russian service after the capitulation. He was labeled a traitor in Sweden and was sentenced to death, along with other officers, for the loss of Finland. Due to a general amnesty, the death penalty process was interrupted, also for him.|$|E
25|$|Inserting neurons into a bioartificial nerve conduit <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> {{most obvious}} method for {{replacing}} damaged nerves; however, neurons {{are unable to}} proliferate and they are often short-lived in culture. Thus, neural progenitor cells are more promising candidates for replacing damaged and degenerated neurons because they are self-renewing, which allows for the in vitro production of many cells with minimal donor material. In order {{to confirm that the}} new neurons formed from neural progenitor cells are a part of a functional network, the presence of synapse formation is required. A study by Ma, Fitzgerald et al. is the first demonstration of murine neural stem and progenitor cell-derived functional synapse and neuronal network formation on a 3D collagen matrix. The neural progenitor cells expanded and spontaneously differentiated into excitable neurons and formed synapses; furthermore, they retained the ability to differentiate into the three neural tissue lineages. It was also demonstrated that not only active synaptic vesicle recycling occurred, but also that excitatory and inhibitory connections capable of generating action potentials spontaneously were formed. Thus, neural progenitor cells are a viable and relatively unlimited source for creating functional neurons.|$|E
25|$|The queen {{serves as}} the primary egg layer of the nest and begins the nest {{construction}} {{at the beginning of}} a season. If she adopt an already existing nest, it is her duty to clean out the nest and prepare it for egg laying. The queen is the top of the caste system and dominates in any dominance interaction with a subordinate. These interactions are fairly common for the queen. Queens tend to forage mainly for pulp, but they have sometimes been observed foraging for insects as well. While queens rarely forage for nectar, co-foundresses and workers do so frequently. Workers are also in charge of distributing food to other adults and larvae when they return from foraging. Workers are key in building cells and raising their walls. Non-workers, on the other hand, rarely forage themselves and depend on the collections of food that foragers bring back to the nest; this behavior defines non-workers. This caste has also been observed to leave the nest for extended periods of time to either mate or forage for themselves. They do, however, contribute to defense of the nest. There have also been examples of non-workers breaking down cell walls after larvae have matured, so it <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> distinction between worker and non-worker is less clear than was previously thought. Finally, males aid in keeping the nest cool in hot temperatures by fanning their wings and they rely heavily on the food that foragers bring back to the nest. They sometimes swarm the foragers in order to get the nectar, pulp, and insects that the foragers bring.|$|E

Roxeanne and her sister Isabel (Kate Hudson) dispute the ownership of a painting by Georges de La Tour with the family of Henri's lover. Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "C" [...] rating and lamented Watts' performance: [...] "I'm disappointed to report that Hudson and Watts have no chemistry as sisters, perhaps because Watts never <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> expatriate artiste she's supposed to be playing".|$|E

Ellefson shared his impressions from performing in front of European fans: [...] "So far, the audiences have been really good {{and it seems to me}} that heavy metal and especially Megadeth are very much at the forefront of music in Europe. It <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> attendance is better than it has ever been".

We used only Marines, no actors or actresses. We used all of the Marine's equipment and they were so lovely to us, I always have fun even though it's a lot of work. Even though I was sore and exhausted, I was so educated on people in the service, who I've always respected but the stuff they go through, and the kind of loyalty they possess, it's very communal, and community.

500|$|One of {{the main}} criticisms of the film was the poor quality of its {{animation}}. Berardinelli called it {{some of the worst}} CGI animation in memory.

When compared to today's visual standards for animated films, Hoodwinked is far below the curve." [...] Burr considered the film's surfaces poorly rendered and compared them to [...] "Teletubbieland reupholstered with Naugahyde." [...] Westbrook felt that the animation worked well for the animal characters, but wrote, [...] "the humans have a glassy sheen and brittle hardness, much like work done {{in the early days of}} CG... That art has come too far to embrace a throwback like Hoodwinked as lovably quaint. It's simply dated." [...] Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post compared the characters to rubber toys, and wrote, [...] "their faces are without nuance or vividness... In movement, especially, do they lack grace and conviction. It <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> recent breakthroughs in computerized magic have bypassed the poor Edwards fellows, as it looks stuck somewhere in the 1970s, or maybe even earlier." ...|$|E

Grey's Anatomy doesn't need McDreamy. So even if the writers do decide to create a new love interest for Ms. Grey (Martin Henderson, perhaps?), it wouldn't matter. I have faith that the show's writers will do this storyline justice, because TV needs more strong single women — and Meredith <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> perfect candidate." [...] The site added, [...] "This past season was almost a trial run for a McDreamy-less Grey's Anatomy. When Derek left for Washington D.C. to pursue his research, Meredith stayed behind and focused on her own career. She didn't chase him. Her priority were her children and the Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital. Meredith showed that she would never put aside her own dreams and aspirations for a man, and I believe that this won't change after Derek's death." ...|$|E
