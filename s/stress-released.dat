40|$|The fibroblast-populated {{three-dimensional}} (3 -D) collagen matrix {{has been}} used to model matrix contraction, cell motility, and general fibroblast biology. MCPIP 1 (monocyte chemotactic protein–induced protein 1) has been shown to regulate inflammation, angiogenesis, and cellular motility. In the present study, we demonstrated induction of MCPIP 1 in human fibroblasts embedded in the <b>stress-released</b> 3 -D collagen matrix, which occurred through activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, phosphoinositide 3 -kinase, and NF-κB. Furthermore, MCPIP 1 induction was associated with inhibition of fibroblast migration out of the nested collagen matrix. MCPIP 1 induction or ectopic expression also upregulated p 53. RNA interference of p 53 prevented the inhibition of migration produced by induction or ectopic expression of MCPIP 1. Our findings suggest a new role for MCPIP 1 as a molecular switch that regulates fibroblast migration in the nested collagen matrix model...|$|E

Their nanomechanical properties and deformation behaviors were characterized by nanoindentation tests. Because {{of the effect of}} high mixing entropies, all the deposited multi-component (AlCrTaTiZr) NxSiy high-entropy coatings exhibited a simple face-centered cubic solid-solution structure. With an increased substrate bias and Si-target power, their microstructures changed from large columns with a [111] preferred orientation to a nanocomposite form with ultrafine grains.

In the deformed regions under indents, stacking faults or partial dislocations were formed, while in the <b>stress-released</b> regions, near-perfect lattices recovered...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} <b>stress-release</b> effects induced by {{man-made}} cuts or excavations into natural stiff clay slopes that experienced erosion {{in response to}} valley deepening. The study {{was focused on the}} Monte Mario hill in Rome (Italy), which formed part of an area of recent urban expansion. The methodology of the study relied on a reference engineering-geology model, which was developed on the basis of site and laboratory data and stress-strain analyses. The latter analyses were carried out with the finite-difference code FLAC 4. 0. Numerical modelling was based on a sequential approach, taking into account the main evolutionary stages of the Tiber river valley in Rome's urban area and then making cuts {{at the bottom of the}} slope located south of the Monte Mario Astronomical Observatory. The simulation revealed the <b>stress-release</b> effects that fluvial erosion and excavation fronts have caused on the investigated slopes and their consequent gravitational instabilities. These processes appear with metre-scale displacements, followed by <b>stress-release</b> cracks (actually observed on the slopes under review).

The present {{study was designed to}} evaluate the possible role of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis on the adaptation of spleen lymphocyte responsiveness to repeated stress. For this purpose, we selected a stressful protocol (aversive auditory stimulation) that induced an initial suppression (1 day), followed by a return to control values with repeated application (4 days), of mitogen- induced lymphocyte proliferation. Because rats exposed to 4 days of noise sessions show enhanced adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and corticosterone levels, we tested the possibility that adaptation of lymphoproliferation by repeated stress was due to a desensitization of splenic lymphocytes to <b>stress-released</b> HPA hormones. The results showed that corticotropin-releasing factor (10 - 9 M) and corticosterone (5 x 10 - 8 and 10 - 7 M), as well as dexamethasone (10 - 8, 5 x 10 - 8, and 10 7 M), significantly suppressed lymphoproliferation from both control and stressed rats in a similar way. ACTH (10 - 9 and 5 x 10 9 M) did not significantly influence ConcanavalinA- stimulated spleen lymphocytes. These data indicate that adaptation of lymphocyte proliferation by repeated noise stress occurs without accompanying alterations in lymphocyte responsiveness to HPA hormones. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Increased shear <b>stress–released</b> NO and {{decreased}} endothelial calcium in rat isolated perfused juxtamedullary nephrons. BackgroundNitric oxide {{is an important}} vasodilator released from endothelial cells by the calcium-dependent endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS). We considered it important to investigate how shear stress/perfusion pressure influenced endothelial cell calcium concentration, nitric oxide release, and autoregulation of the afferent arteriole, since this arteriole controls glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renin releaseMethodsWe used an isolated perfused juxtamedullary nephron preparation and measured calcium with Fura 2, nitric oxide with 4 -amino- 5 methylamino- 2 ′, 7 ′-difluorescein (DAF-FM) and diameter with an imaging system. A mathematical model was applied to calculate changes in nitric oxide concentration and shear stress/wall tension during perfusion with and without erythrocytes at perfusion pressures varying from 50 to 150 mm Hg. ResultCell-free perfusion increased nitric oxide concentration and abolished autoregulation; addition of erythrocytes or l-arginine analog N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) decreased nitric oxide concentration and reinstated autoregulation. Elevated perfusion pressure/elevated shear stress increased nitric oxide release and surprisingly decreased the endothelial cell calcium concentration, with perfusion pressure increase from 50 to 150 mm Hg, using blood perfusion endothelial calcium concentration decreased from 186 ± 39 to 76 ± 25 nmol/L and with cell-free perfusion from 116 ± 33 to 56 ± 21 nmol/L. ConclusionNitric oxide scavenging by erythrocytes has a high impact on arteriolar nitric oxide concentration and autoregulatory response. Nitric oxide measurements in endothelial cells of the afferent arteriole showed that increased perfusion pressure/shear stress increased nitric oxide release, while simultaneously endothelial cell calcium concentration decreased, possibly indicating a feedback control of this calcium by nitric oxide release...|$|E
40|$|The {{initiation}} {{phenomenon of}} a subsurface fatigue crack was examined by {{monitoring of the}} acoustic emission (AE) effects revealed by the slightly surface-hardened specimens of titanium-based VT 3 - 1 (Ti– 6 Al– 2 Sn– 4 Zr– 2 Mo– 0. 1 Si) alloy under fatigue tests. The circumferentially notched round-bar specimens were cyclically stretched in the stress range of 720 – 680 MPa, with the stress ratio varying as 0. 31 – 0. 36, at 35 -Hz loading frequency. The AE monitoring has shown the subsurface cracking events as concomitant with the unloading (compressive) portions of the cyclic load trajectory. In the several fractographically examined areas of subsurface fatigue fracture, mode III (rotational or twist-like) way of crack opening was found to dominate on the short-crack path; during the damage-accumulation period, creative of the first smooth crack-origin facets, such a crack-opening pattern appeared mainly related to the unloading portions of the loading trajectory. Internal residual stresses appear to control such a deformation mode in the locally compressed material. Stress-release effects should follow from the occurrence of the first crack facet favoured by gas diffusion. Therefore, the subsurface crack origination is actually a synergetic problem. The dominant mode-III deformation is also creative of a plastic zone around the now <b>stress-released</b> area of the first fracture facet. This plastic zone is {{to be involved in}} the mode-I (tension) opening of the subsurface crack propagating from the first subsurface crack facet. The subsurface crack opening occurs as facilitated by the dissolved-gas diffusion toward a material discontinuity. Consequently, a short crack can expand around the first facet through a combined modes III and I opening to form a growing subsurface-fracture area. Such a model of the twist-controlled subsurface cracking is proposed and discussed here in terms of the well-known numerical data on the subsurface stress-state evolution as well as on the progress of plastic mesoscopic-scale level deformation in tensile-loaded metals...|$|E

Due to the demand of the whole market of low cost, high performance and IC integrated MEMS microphone, {{our goal is to}} create a high sensitivity acoustic-mechanically functional microphone by only using low temperature fabrication process. The temperature of the whole fabrication process is below 300 °C, which makes the whole process can be integrated with CMOS circuits and is low cost without using any high temperature process equipment. Using CR- 106 R to reduce the parasitic capacitance and the stress released structure of the membrane sealed by parylene to obtain high sensitivity of acoustic signal makes better performance of the microphone than previous designs. Diaphragm of with <b>stress-released</b> structure made of Ti is designed and membrane with 300 μm is studied. Different designs of membranes are simulated to see how the diaphragm responds as part of a mechanical part. By using different sized acoustic holes with different holes spacing, along with different membrane thicknesses, and a geometrical study can be performed. In the geometrical study was a static analysis of different membrane thicknesses in motion under pressure by using the finite element model (FEM) software COVENTORTM. The behavior of the parylene sealed membrane is discussed and the mechanical and acoustic effect of this parylene layer is shown from summarization of the FEM analysis results. In this study, the diaphragm is deposited and patterned by using lift off process.

40|$|The {{experimental}} verification of matrix diffusion in crystalline rocks largely relies on indirect methods {{performed in the}} laboratory. Such methods are prone to perturbations of the rock samples by collection and preparation and therefore the laboratory-derived transport properties and fluid composition might not represent in situ conditions. We investigated the effects induced by the drilling process and natural rock stress release by mass balance considerations and sensitivity analysis of analytical out-diffusion data obtained from originally saturated, large-sized drillcore material from two locations drilled using traced drilling fluid. For in situ <b>stress-released</b> drillcores of quartz-monzodiorite composition from the Aspo HRL, Sweden, tracer mass balance considerations and 1 D and 2 D diffusion modelling consistently indicated a contamination of < 1 % of the original pore water. This chemically disturbed zone extends {{to a maximum of}} 0. 1 mm into the drillcore (61. 8 mm x 180. 1 mm) corresponding to about 0. 66 % of the total pore volume (0. 77 vol. %). In contrast, the combined effects of stress release and the drilling process, which have influenced granodioritic drillcore material from 560 m below surface at Forsmark. Sweden, resulted in a maximum contamination of the derived porewater Cl(-) concentration of about 8 %. The mechanically disturbed zone with modified diffusion properties covers the outermost similar to 6 mm of the drillcore (50 mm x 189 mm), whereas the chemically disturbed zone extends to a maximum of 0. 3 mm based on mass balance considerations, and to 0. 15 mm to 0. 2 mm into the drillcore based on fitting the observed tracer data. This corresponds to a maximum of 2. 4 % of the total pore volume (0. 62 vol. %) being affected by the drilling-fluid contamination. The proportion of rock volume affected initially by drilling fluid or subsequently with experiment water during the laboratory diffusion and re-saturation experiments depends {{on the size of the}} drillcore material and will become larger the smaller the sample used for the experiment. The results are further in support of matrix diffusion taking place in the undisturbed matrix of crystalline rocks at least in the cm range...|$|E

40|$|Four clones of jojoba, Simmondsia chinensis (link, Schneider, {{were used}} to {{study the effects of}} {{salinity}} on the growth and physiological processes of jojoba. The vegetative growth as measured by shoot elongation, new branch development, node number, leaf expansion, new leaf production, and defoliation was studied using an iso-molar mixture of NaCl + CaCl₂ at - 2, - 4, - 8, and - 16 bars. Physiological processes including chlorophyll concentrations, CO₂ exchange rates, stomatal resistances, leaf water potentials, relative water content, leaf succulence, specific leaf weight, proline accumulation, and protein concentrations were measured at weekly intervals after the addition of salts. Twenty four days after exposure to salinity, plants were transferred to control solution in order to study the reversibility of the salt effects on jojoba. The inhibitory effects of salinity on shoot elongation was evident at - 16 bars after 23 days of exposure to salinity. The number of new branches developed during the treatment period did not differ, however, the number of nodes formed on the new branches was less than that of the control. Leaf expansion was inhibited at - 4, - 8 and - 16 bars. Leaf production was significantly reduced at - 16 bars and it recovered during <b>stress-release</b> period. Leaf drop (defoliation) increased with increasing salinity. The inhibitory effects of salinity on jojoba's growth was reversible except for leaf expansion. Total chlorophyll concentrations were significantly reduced at 4 salinity levels and chlorophyll synthesis did not recover at - 4, - 8 and - 16 bars during the <b>stress-release</b> period. CO₂ exchange processes including apparent photosynthesis, dark respiration, light respiration, and gross photosynthesis were not significantly affected up to - 8 bars. However, at - 16 bars, apparent photosynthesis and gross photosynthesis were reduced. Dark respiration was not affected significantly, however, light respiration was reduced at - 4, - 8, and - 16 bars after 16 days of exposure to salinity. This reduction was due to the loss of the post-illumination burst of CO₂. It was concluded that the theory of growth suppression due to accelerated respiration is not true for jojoba. Therefore, the decreased rate of apparent photosynthesis could be attributed to the increased stomatal resistances which increased dramatically at - 16 bars. Leaf water potentials were markedly reduced at - 16 bars for 23 days which indicated a possible osmotic adjustment and jojoba's ability to tolerate higher salinity levels. Although the leaves produced during the treatment period did not show severe damage symptoms, however, frequent tip burn of the younger leaves at - 16 bars indicated that - 16 bars was near the salinity limit for jojoba. Leaf relative water content was reduced markedly at - 8 and - 16 bars which was correlated with leaf water potentials. Leaf succulence based on the ratio of fresh weight/dry weight and specific leaf weight were significantly increased at - 16 bars. Increases in specific leaf weight which correlated with succulence, indicates that it was a function of increased leaf succulence and water accumulation. Free proline accumulated in response to salinity. However, there was no significant increase in proline levels until 23 days of exposure to - 16 bars. Proline levels rapidly decreased to the control level during the <b>stress-release</b> period. It is believed that the accumulation of proline in jojoba does not function in osmotic regulation because of its low accumulation. Total protein concentrations were found to decrease due to high salinity levels (- 16 bars). Although protein synthesis increased during the <b>stress-release</b> period, however, at - 16 bars, no significant recovery was evident which indicated that the inhibition of protein synthesis rather than its breakdown was caused by high salt concentrations...|$|R

AE Sensor is commonly {{defined as the}} sound emitted as an elastic wave by a solid when it is deformed or struck, caused by the rapid release of localized stress energy.

The detection frequency range of acoustic emission is from 1 kHz to 1 MHz. Rapid <b>stress-releasing</b> events generate a spectrum of stress waves starting at 0 Hz and typically falling off at several MHz. AE {{can be related to}} an irreversible release of energy.

When the infants were still alive, self-suckling was of short duration and it was probably a method to improve milk flow when the infant switched from one nipple to the other. After the infants died, self-suckling lasted significantly longer and the females were apparently drinking their own milk. Self-suckling was never observed among the four lactating females in the ‘‘Large’’ troop (including one monkey who lost her infant) and it could thus represent a cultural difference. Moreover, self-suckling after the death of an infant may be explained by the energetic and immunological benefits that a monkey may gain from drinking their own milk.

For cost-effectiveness and large-scale fabrication of GaN devices, we tried to grow a GaN epitaxial layer on silicon substrate with complicated buffer layers for a <b>stress-release.</b> It is known that the structure of the buffer layers affects the performance of devices fabricated on the GaN epitaxial layers.

Earthquakes directly within the SAF zone were intentionally excluded from the analysis because they manifest <b>stress-release</b> processes rather than stress accumulation. The observed increase in seismicity is interpreted as a signature of the increasing stress level in the surrounding crust, whereas the peaks and the subsequent decrease in seismicity are attributed to damage-induced softening processes. Furthermore, in both cases there is a distinctive zone of low seismic activity that surrounds the epicentral region in the pre-event period. The increase of seismicity in the crust surrounding a potential future event {{and the development of a}} low-seismicity epicentral zone can be regarded as promising precursory information that could help signal the arrival of large earthquakes. The Gutenberg-Richter relationship (GRR) should allow extrapolation of seismicity changes down to seismic noise level magnitudes.

Resilin is often found as a composite with chitin in insects cuticle, where chitin serves as the structural component. Resilin provides elasticity and possibly other properties. It was discovered in the salivary pump of assassin bugs, in the feeding pumps of rhodnius prolixus, tsetse flies, reduviid bugs, and honey bees, and in the resistance providing mechanism for the venom-dispensing pump of honey bee. Resilin was also found in the sound production organs of arthropods, such as the Cicadae family and Pyralidae family, where both high elasticity and high resilience of resilin play important roles due to the rapid <b>stress-release</b> cycles of tymbals. Besides these structures, resilin exists most widely in the locomotion systems of arthropods. It was discovered in wing hinges to enable recovery from deformation of wing elements, and to dampen the aerodynamic forces felt by the wing; in ambulatory systems of cockroaches and flies to facilitate rapid joint deformation; in jumping mechanism, resilin stores kinetic energy with great efficiency and release upon unloading. It is also found in the cuticles surrounding abdomen regions of ants and bees, which expand and swell to a great extent during feeding and reproduction process.|$|R

The average mining depth in Huainan area is 875  m and continues to increase by 15 – 25  m annually.

This paper reviews the main achievements (e. g. theories, technologies and equipment) in outburst control in Huainan, and tries to analyze some key challenging issues, and to present associated strategies to address these issues. It suggests that the outburst control in Huainan must take a combination approach of both regional and localized control in which the former plays a dominant role.

40|$|In {{subduction}} zones, {{stress is}} released by earthquakes and transient aseismic slip. The latter falls into two categories: slow slip and afterslip. Slow-slip events emerge spontaneously during the interseismic phase, and show a progressive acceleration of slip with a negligible contribution of synchronous tremors or microseismicity to the energy, or moment release(1 - 12). In contrast, afterslip occurs immediately after large and moderate earthquakes, decelerates over time, and releases between 20 and 400 % {{of the moment}} released by the preceding earthquake(13 - 18). Here we use seismic and GPS data to identify transient aseismic slip that does not fit into either of these categories. We document a seismic-aseismic slip sequence which occurred at shallow depths along a weakly coupled part of the Andean subduction zone(19) in northern Peru and lasted seven months.

40|$|International audienceIn {{subduction}} zones, {{stress is}} released by earthquakes and transient aseismic slip. The latter falls into two categories: slow slip and afterslip. Slow-slip events emerge spontaneously during the interseismic phase, and show a progressive acceleration of slip with a negligible contribution of synchronous tremors or microseismicity to the energy, or moment release 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. In contrast, afterslip occurs immediately after large and moderate earthquakes, decelerates over time, and releases between 20 and 400 % {{of the moment}} released by the preceding earthquake 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.

40|$|Drilling {{has shown}} {{that there is a}} large {{petroleum}} reserve in the Liushagang Formation of the Fushan Depression, South China Sea from reservoirs of the sublacustrine fans. To reduce the risk associated with exploration, the sedimentary characteristics of the sublacustrine fans should be identified and described. Analysis of the drilling cores, well data and 3 D seismic data was conducted to identify and interpret the sublacustrine fans which formed in a lacustrine succession as the low-stand fan of the 2 nd member of Liushagang Formation (SQEls 2). The reservoirs were commonly associated with pebbly conglomerates, mudstone shivers, muddy debris, various deformation structures including micro-faults, liquified deformation structure, ball and pillow structure, slump and <b>stress-release</b> deformation. Further contrastive analysis of sedimentary characteristics and palaeogeomorphology between the western and eastern sublacustrine fans indicates that they belong to two different types of sublacustrine system in continental basins. More specifically, the western fan, controlled by the multi-level step-fault belt, is a typical gravel-rich sublacustrine system which is characterised by structurally controlled, high gradient (2. 8 - 3. 3 °), admixtures of muddy debris and pebbly conglomerates and poor reservoir quality, while the eastern fan, controlled by the flexure slope-break belt, is a sand-rich sublacustrine system dominated by relatively low gradient (2. 0 - 2. 5 °), general fining-upwards trend with good reservoir quality. Therefore, the development of future exploration should be conducted at different levels in the Fushan Depression...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{two-dimensional}} {{finite element model}} {{for the analysis of}} shield tunnels by taking into account the construction process which is divided into four stages. The soil is assumed to behave as an elasto-plastic medium whereas the shield is simulated by beam-joint discontinuous model in which curved beam elements and joint elements are used to model the segments and joints, respectively. As grout is usually injected to fill the gap between the lining and the soil, the property parameters of the grout are chosen {{in such a way that}} they can reflect the state of the grout at each stage. Furthermore, the contact condition between the soil and lining will change with the construction stage, and therefore, different <b>stress-releasing</b> coefficients are used to account for the changes. To assess the accuracy that can be attained by the method in solving practical problems, the shield tunnelling in the No. 7 Subway Line Project in Osaka, Japan, is used as a case history for our study. The numerical results are compared with those measured in the field. The results presented in the paper show that the proposed numerical procedure can be used to effectively estimate the deformation, stresses and moments experienced by the surrounding soils and the concrete lining segments. The analysis and method presented in this paper can be considered to be useful for other subway construction projects involving shield tunnelling in soft soils.

40|$|Abstract We {{estimate}} {{strong motion}} generation areas that reproduce near-source ground motions in a broadband frequency range (0. 2 – 10 Hz) using the empirical Green’s function technique. The strong motion generation areas {{are defined as}} ex-tended areas with relatively large slip velocities within a total rupture area. Four M 6 class (the 1997 Kagoshima on March and May, 1997 Yamaguchi, and 1998 Iwate) and several moderate-size earthquakes in Japan were analyzed. We {{examine the relationship between}} the strong motion generation area and the area of asperities, which is characterized based on heterogeneous slip distributions estimated from low-frequency (1 Hz) waveform inversions (Somerville et al., 1999). We performed waveform fitting in acceleration, velocity, and displacement, then obtained the strong motion generation area occupying {{about a quarter of the}} total rupture area. The size and position of the strong motion generation area coincide with those of characterized asperities. We find self-similar scaling of seismic moment to both the size of the strong motion generation area and the rise time for a magnitude range of analyzed earthquakes. Based on our results, we propose a characterized source model for the broadband ground-motion simulation, which consists of strong motion generation areas with large slip velocities and a background slip area with a small slip velocity. Waveform modeling of the characterized source model suggests that the strong mo-tion generation areas play important roles in simulating broadband ground motions and have the potential to be an about 10 -MPa <b>stress-release</b> area on the fault...|$|R

Surface {{chemistry and}} catalysis studies could significantly {{gain from the}} systematic variation of surface active sites, tested under the very same conditions. Curved crystals are excellent platforms to perform such systematics, which may in turn allow to better resolve fundamental properties and reveal new phenomena. This is demonstrated here for the carbon monoxide/platinum system. We curve a platinum crystal around the high-symmetry (111) direction and carry out photoemission scans on top. This renders the spatial core-level imaging of carbon monoxide adsorbed on a 'tunable' vicinal surface, allowing a straightforward visualization of the rich chemisorption phenomenology at steps and terraces. Through such photoemission images we probe a characteristic elastic strain variation at stepped surfaces, and unveil subtle <b>stress-release</b> effects on clean and covered vicinal surfaces. These results offer the prospect of applying the curved surface approach to rationally investigate the chemical activity of surfaces under real pressure conditions.

40|$|Guitarists {{and bass}} guitarists {{represent}} {{a large portion}} of the musician population yet little has been studied regarding guitarists' perceptions of health and well-being. Studies that have been conducted on guitar and bass players have focused mainly on the physical, musculoskeletal effects of playing the guitar and bass guitar. A few studies focused on the physical impact of playing an instrument also investigated the psychological health of musicians, but only limited to the context of playing-related injuries. The purpose of this qualitative study was to gain insight into how guitar and bass players perceived the effects that playing their instrument had on their health and well-being and the meaning that being a musician held for them. The researcher utilized van Manen's (1994) hermeneutic phenomenological approach to the study. Fifteen participants voluntarily responded to a UMCIRB-approved study announcement that was distributed through on-line musician forums, online classified advertisement sites, word of mouth, and email invitations. Snow-ball sampling also yielded participants who were informed by study participants. The qualitative data was collected through one-on-one, in-depth interviews using an approved interview guide. The researcher collected qualitative data by means of one-on-one, in-depth interviews using an approved interview guide. The researcher transcribed all interviews verbatim and analyzed the data through a system of reading of transcripts, coding data, concept map, and a thematic exploration of data as well as an analysis of data using van Manen's lifeworld existentials. The researcher also engaged in phenomenological reduction, including reflexivity, and maintained a multifaceted audit trail throughout the study. The perspectives of the study participants revealed an overarching theme of Music as Connectedness and four sub-themes: View of Self as Musician, Social Connection Through Playing Music, Communicating Through Playing Music, and Promoting Wellness Through Playing Music. Findings from this study revealed participants' perceptions that playing the guitar or bass guitar was beneficial to their health and well-being, primarily through a process of connectiveness to self; musicians, including those with whom they played; and audiences with whom they shared their music. Perceived health benefits ranged from increased socialization which speaks to social connection, wellness promotion benefits through an increased sense of confidence, increased coping and <b>stress-release</b> skills, enhanced communication avenues as a result of playing music with and for other people, and an over-all sense of well-being...|$|R
