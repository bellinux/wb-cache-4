40|$|Traditionally it’s {{impossible}} {{to monitor the}} freight’s status inside a container which is made of steel and makes data transmission by radio impossible, let alone the wired communication solutions. As container transportation is the prevailing method for international cargos, a feasible way to transmit status of the monitored cargo out of the <b>stacked</b> <b>containers</b> is very important, especially for ones with special requirements such as dangerous goods. This paper proposes a scheme to construct a communication network for <b>stacked</b> <b>containers</b> by deploying communicating nodes on the container’s surface to form a customized wireless sensor network. An effective routing algorithm is also proposed to exploit the characteristic of the network which is composed of smart containers.

This includes a small, cheap, lightweight monitoring device that will make intelligent use of different wireless technologies (UMTS/GPRS and IEEE 802.15. 4 sensor technology) in order to enable optimized and energy-efficient container monitoring. The goal is to realize a cheap generic and energy-efficient connectivity solution including IEEE 802.15. 4 sensor technology for communication between 3 D <b>stacked</b> <b>containers</b> and making use of tailored and highly energy-efficient protocols.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Some {{applications}} require {{wireless transmission}} of information to and from devices located inside metal enclosures, e. g., a closed shipping container in transit. However, traditional radio frequency (RF) communication schemes are not capable of transmitting signals through metal enclosures. As an alternative to RF, an ultrasonic communication system based on multitone frequency-shift keying (MFSK) has been developed and evaluated using the steel corner posts of shipping containers as the com-munication medium. Empirical studies have been performed on the steel channel. The communication system is configurable and consists {{of two or more}} modules. The modules are mounted to the metal posts and utilize an inexpensive ultrasonic transducer to send and receive modulated signals through the metal channel. A module also makes use of an inexpensive digital-signal-processing chip for modulating and demodulating MFSK signals. Two case studies for the shipping container application were evaluated: 1) communicating through one container and 2) communicating between <b>stacked</b> <b>containers.</b> Regarding the second case study, a key discovery was that each of the aggregate steel columns formed by a stack of shipping containers can serve as an ultrasonic communication channel that spans all containers in the stack.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 20 th Annual South African Transport Conference 16 - 20 July 2001 "Meeting the transport challenges in Southern Africa", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. In container ports pavements are subjected to ultra heavy wheel loads that may greatly exceed those of highway trucks, but often fewer repetitions are applied. These pavements are typically termed heavy duty pavements. The heavy duty pavement at the Transnet Container holding area at City Deep, Johannesburg had been in service for about 20 years and it showed severe cracking. The pavement was still serviceable and in operation, but rehabilitation or rebuilding {{had to be done}} in order to prevent the pavement from becoming unserviceable. The pavement consisted of a 300 mm concrete slab pavement and rebuilding of this pavement was an option, but it involved high expenditure. As the existing concrete pavement had severe block cracking, and in some areas even crocodile cracking, a concrete slab overlay would require a slab of substantial thickness to rehabilitate the pavement. Concrete-filled geocells has shown substantial promise for new concrete pavements under ultra heavy loading conditions (Visser, 1999) and it was decided to investigate the suitability of these cells as a rehabilitation measure. The geocells, known as Hyson-Cells, offer three-dimensional interlocking cast in-situ blocks. It further offers resistance to slew caused by turning movements of heavy vehicles as well as resistance to the point loads of <b>stacked</b> <b>containers.</b> Hyson-Cells differs from interlocking pavements in that it is cast in-situ and that interlocking takes place in a three dimensional direction. Models explaining the three dimensional interaction between the blocks are very complex and the structural and functional contribution of such an overlay can best be investigated by experimental techniques.
