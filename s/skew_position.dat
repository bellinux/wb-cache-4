40|$|A {{simulation}} {{study has}} been performed on a small log database of tropical hardwoods consisting of 10 Jambirre (Millettia stuhlmannii Taub.) and 5 Umbila (Pterocarpus angolensis D. C.) logs. The outer log shape was acquired by a 3 D laser scanner before sawing and the heartwood content was estimated by measurement on images of the centre slabs after through-and-through sawing. Yield and value recovery using different sawing techniques and different sawing patterns, together with rotational and <b>skew</b> <b>positioning</b> errors, are presented. The results show that through-and-through sawing in the best rotation and <b>skew</b> <b>positions</b> tested improves the yield of Umbila logs {{by an average of}} 4. 5 percentage points and Jambirre logs by 3. 6 percentage points compared to cant sawing. It can be concluded that positioning and sawing patterns have a great influence on the yield and value recovery of these species and that log grade and species {{have an impact on the}} sawing pattern that should be used.

40|$|Chemical vapor {{deposition}} (CVD) diamond {{windows are}} a crucial component in heating and current drive (H&CD) applications. In {{order to minimize}} the amount of reflected power from the diamond disc, its thickness must match the desired beam wavelength, thus proper targeting of the plasma requires movable beam reflectors. This is the case, for instance, of the ITER electron cyclotron H&CD system. However, looking at DEMO, the higher heat loads and neutron fluxes could make the use of movable parts close to the plasma difficult. The issue might be solved by using gyrotrons able to tune the beam frequency to the desired resonance, but this concept requires transmission windows that work in a given frequency range, such as the Brewster window. It consists of a CVD diamond disc brazed to two copper cuffs at the Brewster angle. The brazing process is carried out at about 800 °C and then the temperature is decreased down to room temperature. Diamond and copper have very different thermal expansion coefficients, therefore high stresses build up during the cool down phase {{that might lead to}} failure of the disc. Considering also the complex geometry of the window with the <b>skewed</b> <b>position</b> of the disc, analyses are required in the first place to check its feasibility.

40|$|Abstract Errors in {{modeling}} atmospheric delays {{are one of}} {{the limiting}} factors in the accuracy of GPS position determination. In regions with uneven topography, atmospheric delay phenomena can be especially complicated. Current delay models used in analyzing GPS data from the Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) are successful in achieving millimeter-level accuracy at most locations; however, at a subset of stations, the time series for position estimates contain an unusually large number of outliers. In many cases these outliers are oriented in the same direction. The stations which exhibit asymmetric outliers occur in various places across the PBO network, but they are especially numerous in California's Mammoth Lakes region, which served as a case study for this project. The phenomenon of skewed residuals was analyzed by removing secular trends and variations with periods longer than 75 days from the signal using a median filter. The skewness of the station position residuals was subsequently calculated in the north, east and up directions. In the cases examined, typical position outliers are 5 - 15 mm. In extreme cases, <b>skewed</b> <b>position</b> residuals, not related to snow on antennas, can be as large as 20 mm. I examined the causes of the skewness through site-by-site comparisons with topographic data and various forms of weather data such as numerical weather models, radiosondes, and satellite images. Analysis suggests that the direction of the skewness is generally parallel to the local topographic gradient at a scale of several kilometers. Comparison with weather data suggests that outlier data points in the Mammoth Lakes region occur when lee waves are likely to form downstream of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The results imply that coupling between the atmosphere and local topography, e. g. lee waves, is responsible for the phenomenon of skewed residuals. by Kathryn Materna. Thesis: S.

40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{system to}} {{estimate}} the weed density between two rows of soybeans was developed. An environmentally adaptive segmentation algorithm (EASA) was used to segment the plants from {{the background of the}} image. The effect of two image data transformations on the segmentation performance of the EASA was investigated, and the RGB-IV 1 V 2 transformation resulted in significantly higher quality segmentation results based on morphological opening and closing pixel loss over the RGB-rgb transformation. An adaptive scanning algorithm (ASA) was developed and used to automatically detect crop inter-row edges and {{to estimate the}} number of weeds in the inter-row area. Two sets of images were acquired under sunny and overcast sky conditions. The ASA-detected crop row edge positions were significantly correlated with the manually detected crop row positions, with the distribution <b>skewed</b> towards <b>positions</b> internal to the row. ASA weed density estimates were highly correlated with manual weed counts for both lighting conditions. However, when a limited range of the data was considered, much lower correlations resulted, revealing a loss of spatial color resolution due to the transmission of the video signal.

Three positioning parameters were studied, the offset, skew, and rotation, combined with two sawing patterns of cant-sawing and through-and-through sawing. A database consisting of two tropical hardwood species with very different outer shapes, jambirre (Millettia stuhllmannii Taub.) and umbila (Pterocarpus angolensis DC.), was used to simulate the sawing process. The result of the simulation revealed that, according to the combined effect of offset, <b>skew,</b> and rotation <b>positioning,</b> the positioning of the log before sawing is extremely important to achieve a high volume yield of sawn timber. The positioning parameter that has the highest effect on the volume yield is the rotation, and the variation in the volume yield associated with a deviation in the positioning can reduce the volume yield of sawn timber by between 7. 7 % and 12. 5 %.

40|$|Purpose: It is {{important}} to establish a differential diagnosis between {{the different types of}} nystagmus, in order to give the appropriate clinical approach to every situation and to improve visual acuity. The nystagmus is normally blocked when the eyes are positioned in a particular way. This makes the child adopt a posture of ocular torticollis that reduces the nistagmiformes movements, improving the vision in this position. A way to promote the blocking of the nystagmic movements is by using prismatic lenses with opposite bases, to block or minimize the oscillatory movements. This results in a vision improvement and it reduces the anomalous head position. There is limited research on the visual results in children with nystagmus after using prisms with opposing bases. Our aim is to describe the impact on the visual acuity (VA) of theprescription prism lenses in a nystagmus patient starting at 3 months of age. Methods: Case report on thirty month old caucasian male infant, with normal growth and development for their age, with an early onset of horizontal nystagmus at 3 months of age. Ophthalmic examination included slit lamp examination, fundus, refractive study, electrophysiological and magnetic resonance tests, measurement of VA over time with the Teller Acuity Cards (TAC) in the distance agreed for the age. At age ten months, the mother noted a persistent turn {{to the right of the}} child’s head, which became increasingly more severe along the months. There’s no oscillopcia. At 24 months, an atropine refraction showed the following refractive error: 0 D. : - 1, 50, OS: - 0, 50 and prismatic lens adapting OD 8 Δ nasal base and OE 8 Δ temporal base. Results: Thirty month old child, with adequate development for their age, with onset of idiopatic horizontal nystagmus, at 3 months of age. Normal ocular fundus and magnetic ressoance without alterations, sub-normal results in electrophysiological tests and VA with values below normal for age. At 6 months OD 20 / 300; OE 20 / 400; OU 20 / 300. At 9 months OD 20 / 250; OE 20 / 300; OU 20 / 150 (TAC a 38 cm). At 18 months OD 20 / 200; OE 20 / 100; OU 20 / 80 (TAC at 38 cm), when the head is turned to the right and the eyes in levoversão, the nystagmus decreases in a “neutral” area. At 24 month, with the prismatic glasses, OD 20 / 200 OE 20 / 100, OU 20 / 80 (TAC at 54 cm, reference value is 20 / 30 – 20 / 100 para OU e 20 / 40 – 20 / 100 monocular), there was an increase in the visual acuity. The child did visual stimulation with multimedia devices and using glasses. After adaptation of prisms: at 30 months VA (with Cambridge cards) OD e OE = 6 / 18. The child improved the VA and reduced the anomalous head position. There is also improvement in mobility and fine motricity. Conclusion: Prisms with opposing bases., were used in the treatment of idiopathic nystagmus. Said prisms were adapted to reduce the <b>skewed</b> <b>position</b> of the head, and to improve VA and binocular function.

40|$|Airline {{profit margins}} are very small. In a highly {{competitive}} market, {{the challenge is to}} differentiate from other airlines. Differentiation within an airplane is difficult, because of the rigidity of an airplane and the strict regulations. The economy is in a lift, businesses allow their employees to fly business class more often. First class and business class only represent 10 - 15 % {{of the total number of}} seats globally but is responsible for 50 % of the revenue. This makes business class travel very relevant to major airliners Seat comfort is a tool used by the airlines to differentiate themselves. Within a review of three business class seats, the participants were asked if there was something comfortable or uncomfortable about their sitting position. 30 % of their answers mentioned shoulder, arm and hand comfort of which 65 % was negative and 35 % positive. 46 % of this 30 % explicitly mentioned the armrests. The assignment was to improve the comfort of a business class armrest in order to improve the comfort of the entire seat. This project was done together with RECARO Aircraft Seating. The focus was on improving their current armrest (of their long-haul business class seat) in physical comfort and privacy. Furthermore, facilitating the activities reading and watching IFE (In Flight Entertainment) were selected to focus on. During the analysis phase, general aspects that could be improved about the armrest and aspects of specific activities were identified. Some of these general aspects were, the asymmetric position of the armrests leading to <b>skewed</b> sitting <b>positions,</b> hard and slippery materials, the lack of space to place the arms and the lack of adjustability options. A specific opportunity for improvement for the activity reading was the conflict between getting tired arms from holding the reading device on eye level or feeling the tension in neck and shoulder when looking down to the reading device. Another area for improvement was observed specifically for the RECARO business class seat. When the seat moves forward to a more relaxed position, the armrests stay at the same place reducing the length available for the arms to rest on and reducing the width. The final proposed design is an armrest which can be integrated into the current RECARO long-haul business class seat. The top part of the armrest can automatically move forward together with the seat so the space available for arm support while watching IFE is optimized. Both armrests have the same adjustability options to improve the symmetry of the sitting position. the up/down movement of the armrest can also be adjusted automatically with the same control panel as the seat adjustments. The reading position is improved by the added function of upwards rotation and inwards rotation. When the armrests are placed under an angle the reading device is brought closer to eye height while supporting the arms. Participants experienced the new design as more comfortable for reading than the current armrest positioning during a user test. An option for a privacy screen was designed to be added to the armrest. This involved a screen that rotates down originating from the current privacy panel. Although the panel improves the privacy significantly for sleeping, the effect only works if the armrests are moved fully up, which takes away moving space and does not improve the privacy for other sitting positions. Therefore a different solution for this needs to be sought. Further improvement to the armrests can be made by searching for a way to make the inner armrest longer for reading. And the usability of the armrest design should be evaluated to check if the use is understood by the passengers. Integrated Product Desig...|$|R
40|$|Branches {{on trees}} {{introduce}} defects on sawn timber called knots. By scanning sawlogs using computed tomography, knots {{can be detected}} and accounted for so that the sawing process can be optimized with respect to outgoing product value. How the optimization should be done differs depending on available sawing equipment and the production strategy of the sawmill. It is important to investigate interesting production strategies with computer simulations to obtain an approximation of the profitability for a sawmill if investing in a computed tomography scanner. Another important step in the optimization process is to automatically segment knots {{so that they can}} be used by a computer when optimizing. This thesis presents an algorithm that automatically segments knots from computed tomography images of logs. The algorithm uses variable thresholds to segment knots on cylindrical shells of the computed tomography images. The knots are fitted to ellipses and matched between several cylindrical shells. The algorithm was tested on a variety of Scandinavian Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) with a knot detection rate of 88 - 94 % and generating about 1 % falsely detected knots. Knots are defects with high impact on boards that are graded with respect to their bending strength. Some sawmills specialize in the production of such boards and this thesis includes a simulation study of sawing Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) logs to optimize the outgoing board value for such a sawmill. The production strategy investigated in this thesis was scanning of sawlogs with computed tomography and optimizing the rotational positioning of the logs in the sawing process. This study showed a possible mean value increase of the sawn timber by 11 %. There are additional degrees of freedom in log breakdown than rotational positioning, such as log spatial <b>position,</b> <b>skew</b> and which sawing pattern to use. If every possible combination of sawing parameters would be simulated, enormous computational resources would be required. A study made in this thesis investigates the feasibility to use only parts of the knot information when optimizing log rotational position. This is done by projecting all knots to a plane perpendicular to the log lengthwise direction and filter out the least significant knots. The study showed a great challenge in this approach and the presented algorithm was insufficient in its present form to compete with alternatives that use full information of the knots.

40|$|We present new {{high-resolution}} {{observations of}} the central region in the late-type spiral galaxy M 100 (NGC 4321) supplemented by three-dimensional numerical modeling of stellar and gas dynamics, including star formation (SF). Near-infrared imaging has revealed a small bulge of 4 '' effective diameter; a 60 '' radial length stellar bar of moderate strength, previously inferred from optical and 21 cm observations; and an ovally shaped, ringlike structure in {{the plane of the}} disk between 10 ''- 22 '' from the center, whose major axis makes a large angle with the bar. The K isophotes become progressively elongated and <b>skewed</b> to the <b>position</b> angle of the bar both outside and inside the ''ring,'' forming an inner barlike region. The galaxy exhibits a mild circumnuclear starburst concentrated in the inner part of the K ''ring. '' This SF is prominent in Ha and the U, B, and V bands, forming an incomplete ring. In addition, two strong local maxima of K emission have been observed to lie remarkably symmetrically with respect to the galactic nucleus and equidistant from it at 7. '' 5, slightly leading the stellar bar. CO molecular emission is peaked in the dust lanes seen in the I - K color index image. We interpret the twists in K isophotes and the swinging of spiral arms through similar to 360 degrees inside the corotation radius as being indicative of the presence of a double inner Lindblad resonance (ILR) and test this hypothesis by modeling the gas flow in a self-consistent gas+stars disk embedded in a halo, with an overall NGC 4321 -like mass distribution in the system. Both ILRs have been verified using nonlinear orbit analysis by determining the spatial extent of the family of orbits oriented along the minor axis of the bar. We have reproduced the basic morphology of the region inside corotation, including (1) the similar to 60 degrees bar; (2) the large-scale trailing shocks representing the offset dust lanes in the bar; (3) two symmetric K peaks corresponding to gas compression maxima which lie at the caustic formed by the interaction of a pair of trailing and leading shocks {{in the vicinity of the}} inner ILR, both peaks being sites of SF; and (4) two additional zones of SF corresponding to gas compression maxima at the bar's minor axis, where the large-scale shocks start to curl and which are referred in the literature as ''twin peaks. '' We argue further that the twisting of K isophotes in the neighborhood of the resonance region requires a population of red stars which are dynamically young and follow gas rather than stellar orbits, i. e., red supergiants. At the same time, a substantial contribution from OB stars to the K light is expected within the inner kiloparsec and especially in the symmetric K peaks. We also conclude that NGC 4321 hosts a single stellar bar which fuels the starburst activity within the circumnuclear ''ring'' by channeling gas there at the median rate of similar to 0. 1 - 1 Mo yr(- 1) ...|$|R
