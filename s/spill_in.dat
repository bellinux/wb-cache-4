5|$|Hydrocarbon {{exploration}} {{in deep water}} occasionally results in significant environmental degradation resulting mainly from accumulation of contaminated drill cuttings, but also from oil spills. While the oil gusher involved in the Deepwater Horizon oil <b>spill</b> <b>in</b> the Gulf of Mexico originates from a wellhead only 1500meters below the ocean surface, it nevertheless illustrates the kind of environmental disaster that can result from mishaps related to offshore drilling for oil and gas.|$|E

Fluor has also built a rail line in Europe and missile sites in Arizona. The company provided disaster recovery services in Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina. In 2010 Fluor provided workers to clean up oil tar on beaches in Florida and Alabama after the Deepwater Horizon oil <b>spill.</b> <b>In</b> December 2012, Fluor was awarded a $3.14 billion contract {{to build a new}} Tappan Zee Bridge over the Hudson River.|$|E
5|$|Continued poor weather drove New Carissa {{closer to}} the shore. Technical teams from two salvage contractors, Smit International and Salvage Master, had {{been working with the}} Coast Guard since February 5 and had drawn up plans to attempt to refloat the vessel, but when cracks in the hull and oil leaks were {{observed}} on February 8, any refloating attempts were precluded by the focus on preventing of a large-scale oil <b>spill.</b> <b>In</b> addition, Salvage Chief, upon her arrival, was unable to reach New Carissa with her tow gear. On February 10, New Carissa suffered major structural failure when the hull breached near the engine room, flooding the engines with seawater (and thus disabling them). The ship's insurers declared the vessel to be a total loss. As a result, New Carissa was no longer a salvageable vessel; instead, she had effectively become a shipwreck.|$|E

5|$|Wales {{has three}} {{national}} parks: Snowdonia, Brecon Beacons and Pembrokeshire Coast. It has five Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty; Anglesey, the Clwydian Range and Dee Valley, the Gower Peninsula, the Ll≈∑n Peninsula, and the Wye Valley. The Gower Peninsula {{was the first}} area in the United Kingdom to be designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, in 1956. Forty {{two percent of the}} coastline of south and west Wales is designated as Heritage Coast, with 13 specific designated strips of coastline maintained by Natural Resources Wales (successor body to the Countryside Council for Wales). As from 2012 the coastline of Wales has 43 Blue Flag beaches and five Blue Flag marinas. Despite its heritage and award winning beaches; the south and west coasts of Wales, along with the Irish and Cornish coasts, are frequently blasted by Atlantic westerlies/south westerlies that, over the years, have sunk and wrecked many vessels. On the night of 25 October 1859, over 110 ships were destroyed off the coast of Wales when a hurricane blew in from the Atlantic. More than 800 lives were lost across Britain because of the storm, but the greatest tragedy was the sinking of the Royal Charter off the coast of Anglesey in which 459 people died. The number of shipwrecks around the coast of Wales reached a peak in the 19th century with over 100 vessels lost and an average loss of life of about 78 sailors per year. Wartime action caused losses near Holyhead, Milford Haven and Swansea. Because of offshore rocks and unlit islands, Anglesey and Pembrokeshire are still notorious for shipwrecks, most notably the Sea Empress oil <b>spill</b> <b>in</b> 1996.|$|E
