The data model of the International Crop Information System (ICIS) allows breeding processes to be recorded unambiguously in a relational database. This paper describes this model, which underlies the Genealogical Management System (GMS) of ICIS. The model recognizes three classes of methods by which genetic material is advanced. Generative methods such as crossing or mutagenesis increase variation. Derivative methods usually involve selection, and maintenance methods conserve the genetic makeup of germplasm, such as in <b>seed</b> <b>multiplications.</b> Unlike systems that only track pedigrees, the model describes steps of selection. Applications are illustrated for self-pollinating, outcrossing, and clonally propagated crops. The ICIS GMS is in use for species including rice (Oryza sativa L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), maize (Zea mays L.), potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), lesquerella [Lesquerella fendleri (Gray) S. Wats. ], and witloof chicory (Cichorium intybus L.). The International Rice Information System, based on ICIS, holds more than 2. 6 million unique identifiers for germplasm accessions, crosses, populations, and lines, requiring about 900 megabytes of storage space, which can easily be managed on a personal computer. The GMS model appears suited for widespread use in managing data on crop improvement. © Crop Science Society of America...|$|R

Those which were pressed on FTA cards were further analysed by Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Virus-like symptoms such as yellowish-green mosaic, leaf rolling and vein necrosis were observed and recorded at the time of field sample collection. DAS-ELISA results suggested the occurrence of all six viruses in samples from Mbeya region. RT-PCR analysis confirmed the presence of these viruses except PVY.

Previous research from Timor-Leste indicates that the likelihood of an individual adopting a new variety is strongly related to the closeness of social relationships with growers already using that variety. This research explored the hypothesis that social capital, that is social relationships within a farmer group, can be leveraged for development through seed production groups. The groups were established in 2011 for seed production as part of the National Seed System for Released Varieties primarily through previously existing farmer groups. After 2  years, in 2013, a survey was conducted on 30 seed production groups.

Tetragonia tetragonioides, a wild halophytic species has been studied for this purpose. It was studied the effect of high salt concentrations on growth and mineral composition and the influence of high calcium concentration on plant response. Plants were grown in 5 litters in randomized pots and were daily irrigated. The NaCl concentration of the irrigation solution ranged from 0 up to 200 mM. Additionally, the irrigation solution provided plants with two calcium concentrations: 2 and 10 mM of CaCl 2. T. tetragonioides present high ability for sodium and chloride leaf accumulation.
