40|$|A {{number of}} {{self-regulating}} shielding gas valves {{have been developed}} to synchronise the shielding gas flow rate to the welding current being used in the gas metal arc welding process (GMAW). These valves make claims to reduce the shielding gas consumption by up to 60 %. One such system, the Regula® EWR Pro, has undergone detailed evaluation in an effort to fully understand the benefits that could be obtained. This electromagnetically controlled system necessitates around an extremely fast response valve, which opens and closes continually throughout the welding process. This creates a pulsing of the shielding gas, further reducing consumption whilst maintaining optimal shielding gas flow. The unit has been identified to reduce the initial gas surge at weld initiation and results in a virtually instant decay of gas flow at weld termination. These particular characteristics {{have been found to be}} ideally suited to saving shielding gas when carrying out intermittent or <b>stitch</b> <b>welding.</b> It was established that the use of this valve generated deeper penetration in fillet welds, which in turn has highlighted the potential to increase the welding speed, therefore further reducing gas consumption. In addition, a computational model has been developed to simulate the effects of cross drafts. The combination of reducing the gas surge and slow decay with faster welding has been shown to meet the drive for cost savings and improving the carbon footprint...|$|E
40|$|Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is a {{solid-state}} {{joining technique}} developed by The Welding Institute, UK. The tool employed in FSW {{consists of a}} spinning pin with a stepped shoulder. The pin is inserted into the seam line between two sheets or plates to be welded. As the pin rotates and traverses along the joint line, it heats the surrounding material, plasticizes it severely, and stirs it, thus creating a weld. Friction Stir Processing (FSP), which is a derivative of FSW, uses the stirring action of the pin to produce fine-grained material. Traditional estimates of the strain-rate during FSP have relied {{on the relationship between}} the measured grain-size and Zener-Hollomon parameter of the process. In this thesis a soft and ductile aluminum foil was embedded within a work-piece undergoing FSP to observe the deformation zone around the pin. The logarithmic thickness strain was experimentally measured by observing the change in thickness of the foil. Additionally the strain-rate was numerically evaluated from the FSP process parameters and the deformed foil geometry using finite-element analysis. In the same vein research was carried out to enhance shear-rate in FSP by devising a novel joining technique using multiple pins. Using a patented concept (U. S. Patent No. 7597237) a multi-pin Friction Driven <b>Stitch</b> <b>Welding</b> (FDSW) apparatus was designed and tested. In addition the joining efficacy of the FDSW apparatus was numerically estimated via finite element analysis. FSW has traditionally been employed in joining low melting-temperature metals e. g. aluminum and magnesium. In this thesis FSP was used in conjunction with laser-assisted Direct Metal Deposition (DMD) to repair and restore marine components which suffer degradation due to corrosion. Towards that end FSP of copper-nickel 70 - 30 and 4340 steel was explored. Repair was also attempted on a marine component consisting of a thin cylindrical shell. This particular part which is made out of 7475 aluminum doesn’t lend itself to deposition by DMD. Direct plug-based repair of this part by FSP was attempted. The challenges encountered and the means of circumventing them are described in this thesis...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{investigate}} the weldability of a metal polymer sandwich structure. The welding of the sandwich material proceeds first by welding of the skin layer. The material selected for this research is Steelite, a sandwich structure developed by Corus, with 0. 12 mm thick mild steel skin layers adhesively bonded to a 0. 62 mm thick polypropylene core. The primary concerns when welding the skin layers of a metal polymer sandwich structure are degradation of the polymer core, and how this may affect the welding of the skin layer. For this reason low heat input pulsed laser welding was chosen, which enables precise control over {{the amount of energy}} delivered to the workpiece, and thus the heat build-up. Three types of pulsed laser welding were investigated, single spot welds, overlapping spot <b>welds,</b> and <b>stitched</b> <b>welds.</b> The single spot weld experiments reveal {{that it is possible to}} create almost defect free partial penetration spot welds in the skin layer of Steelite. The formation of the single spot welds occurs in three stages: initial heating where no melting occurs then melting and a rapid increase in size to a diameter dependant on the focal spot size of the laser beam, and finally growth proceeding at a decreased rate until the end of the pulse or until a blowhole is formed. Overlapping spot weld experiments were carried out with varying welding parameters. It was observed that an increase in heat input not only increases the width of the weld, as expected, but also changes the surface appearance. At low heat inputs the surface has a typical overlapping spot weld appearance. With an increase in heat input, a splash feature appears first with striking regularity. At the highest heat inputs where a weld is formed, the âsplashâ feature gives way to a rough and pocked appearance. The variation in surface appearance is of import as it is related to the depth of penetration and microstructure. The overlapping, discrete, spot weld appearance corresponds to partial penetration welds. The "splash" features appears once the welds are fully penetrated and indicate the presence and the location of flues, which have a different structure from the rest of the weld and a high carbon content. The last, pocked, surface appearance corresponds to high heat input full penetrations welds. These pocked welds have fully dendritic structures, carbon contents of approximately 5 wt. %, and Vickers hardnesses of up to 960 HV, the combination of which indicates a white cast iron structure. The absorption of carbon shifts the composition of the original mild steel towards the eutectic point on the iron carbon phase diagram, reducing the melting point. Stitching is a method of making a seam weld from overlapping spot welds while preventing the heat build up responsible for the degradation of the polymer core. Experiments show that the degradation under the <b>stitched</b> <b>welds</b> is significantly reduced in comparison to pulsed laser seam welds of comparable depth. Analytical and finite element modelling were carried out. The analytical model is based on Martin and Bowmans model which assumes a Gaussian heat source and a semi-infinite work piece. The results for the weld diameter of the single spot welds are quite accurate for short pulse times, however the results become less accurate with increasing pulse time. Finite element modelling proved more successful for predicting weld diameter for varying combinations of pulse parameters. Although the weld diameter can be predicted within 15 %, the weld penetration is almost always over predicted. Despite this, the prediction for the degraded area in the core is reasonably accurate to first order. Mechanical Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R

Hung banners can have a pole pocket at the bottom to hold a weighted bar which can add tension to the display and prevent it from billowing up.|$|R
40|$|Friction Stir Welding {{has seen}} a fast uptake in many {{industry}} segments. Mechanical properties superior to fusion welding, the ability to weld "unweldable" aluminium alloys and low distortion are often described as {{the main reasons for}} the fast industrial implementation of FSW. Most existing applications consist of long straight welding joints. Applications with complex weld geometries, however, are rarely produced by FSW. These geometries can induce thermal variations during the welding process, thus making it challenging to maintain a consistent weld quality. In-process adaptation of weld parameters to respond to geometrical variations and other environmental variants allow new design opportunities for FSW. Weld quality {{has been shown to be}} reliant on the welding temperature. However, the optimal methodology to control the temperature is still under development. The research work presented in this thesis focuses on some steps to take in order to reach the improvement of the FSW temperature controller, thus reach a better and consistent weld quality. In the present work different temperature methods were evaluated. Temperature measurements acquired by the tool-workpiece thermocouple (TWT) method were accurate and fast, and thereby enhanced suitable for the controller. Different environmental conditions influencing the material heat dissipation were imposed in order to verify the controller effect on the joint quality. In comparison with no controlled weld, the use of the controller enabled a fast optimization of welding parameters for the different conditions, leading to an improvement of the mechanical properties of the joint. For short weld lengths, such as <b>stitch</b> <b>welds,</b> the initial plunge and dwell stages occupy a large part of the total process time. In this work temperature control was applied during these stages. This approach makes the plunge and dwell stages more robust by preventing local material overheating, which could lead to a tool meltdown. The TWT method was demonstrated to allow a good process control during plunging and continuous welding. The approach proposed for control offers weld quality consistency and improvement. Also, it allows a reduction of the time required for the development of optimal parameters, providing a fast adaptation to disturbances during welding and, by decreasing the plunge time, provides a significant decrease on the process time for short welds...|$|R

This technique works at a distance, without surface preparation, and is then specially adapted to inspect moving and hot parts of complex geometrical shapes. Applications of laser-ultrasonics to the automotive industry have been rarely reported, and this paper is aimed to present some applications developed at the Industrial Materials Institute of the National Research Council of Canada. A first application is the evaluation of weld integrity. Welds produced by different methods such as laser <b>stitches,</b> spot <b>welding,</b> friction stir welding as well as conventional MIG welding were tested by the technique, and some examples are presented. A second application that has been explored is {{the evaluation of the}} magnesium/aluminum interface of a novel engine crankcase casting, in which delaminated and well bonded zones were clearly separated in the laserultrasonic images. A third application is the measurement of paint thickness, not only when it is dried but also following application when it is still wet. For this application, thickness can be obtained following a spectroscopic analysis of the laser-ultrasonic data. Finally, adhesive bonding is a new trend in the automotive industry and results are presented on the assessment of bond strength.
