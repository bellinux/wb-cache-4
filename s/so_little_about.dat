Quite simply it is wasted on a nation that cares <b>so</b> <b>little</b> <b>about</b> {{the quality of its}} bread that it has allowed itself to be mesmerized into buying the equivalent of eight and a quarter million large white factory-made loaves every day of the year.|$|E
5|$|The native Britons had {{converted}} to Christianity under Roman rule. The Anglo-Saxon invasions separated the British church from European Christianity for centuries, so {{the church in}} Rome had no presence or authority in Britain, and in fact, Rome knew <b>so</b> <b>little</b> <b>about</b> the British church that it was unaware of any schism in customs. However, Æthelberht would have known something about the Roman church from his Frankish wife, Bertha, who had brought a bishop, Liudhard, with her across the Channel, and for whom Æthelberht built a chapel, St Martin's.|$|E
25|$|Critics of the Barrow and Tipler SAP {{claim that}} it is neither {{testable}} nor falsifiable, and thus is not a scientific statement but rather a philosophical one. The same criticism has been leveled against the hypothesis of a multiverse, although some argue that it does make falsifiable predictions. A modified version of this criticism is that we understand <b>so</b> <b>little</b> <b>about</b> the emergence of life, especially intelligent life, that it is effectively impossible to calculate the number of observers in each universe. Also, the prior distribution of universes {{as a function of}} the fundamental constants is easily modified to get any desired result.|$|E

25|$|A {{frequent}} {{critique of}} the discipline is that the hypotheses of evolutionary psychology are frequently arbitrary and difficult or impossible to adequately test, thus questioning its status as an actual scientific discipline, for example because many current traits probably evolved to serve different functions than they do now. While evolutionary psychology hypotheses are difficult to test, evolutionary psychologists assert {{that it is not}} impossible. Part of the {{critique of the}} scientific base of evolutionary psychology includes a critique of the concept of the Environments of Evolutionary Adaptation. Some critics have argued that researchers know <b>so</b> <b>little</b> <b>about</b> the environment in which Homo sapiens evolved that explaining specific traits as an adaption to that environment becomes highly speculative. Evolutionary psychologists respond that they do know many things about this environment, including the facts that present day humans' ancestors were hunter-gatherers, that they generally lived in small tribes, etc.|$|E
500|$|Marseille's {{impact on}} Allied fighter pilots and their morale is unclear. Andrew Thomas quoted Pilot Officer Bert Houle of No. 213 Squadron RAF; [...] "He was an {{extremely}} skilled pilot and a deadly shot. It was a helpless feeling to be continually bounced, and to do <b>so</b> <b>little</b> <b>about</b> it." [...] Robert Tate, on the other hand, is skeptical Allied pilots would have been familiar, asking, [...] "How well was Marseille known to DAF personnel in the Desert? Apparently not so well. Although there is little indication that some Allied pilots may have heard of Marseille, this information did not readily make its way down to Allied Squadrons. Fanciful stories abound of how pilots knew of one another and hoped to duel {{with each other in}} the skies. This was more than likely not the case." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1924, the United States Forest Service {{started a}} program to set aside [...] "primitive areas" [...] in the {{national}} forests to protect wilderness while opening it to use. [...] Yard, who preferred to give the land that did not meet his standards to the Forest Service rather than the NPS, began {{to work closely with}} the USFS. [...] Beginning in 1925, he served as secretary of the Joint Committee on the Recreational Survey of Federal Lands, a position he held until 1930. [...] Composed of members of both the NPA and the USFS, the committee sought a separate national recreation policy that would distinguish between recreational and preservation areas. [...] The NPA and Yard were both criticized by activists who feared that the association would be eclipsed by the Forest Service's own program goals. [...] Yard at times felt isolated and under-appreciated by his peers. [...] He wrote in 1926, [...] "I wonder whether I'm justified in forcing this work upon people who seem to care <b>so</b> <b>little</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|E

50|$|Although it is {{strongly}} implied that George and Childie are lesbians, and {{towards the end}} {{it is suggested that}} Mercy could be as well, this is never explicitly stated. Marcus intended the play to be a farce, not a serious treatment of lesbianism, but because there was <b>so</b> <b>little</b> material <b>about</b> lesbians it became treated as such.|$|R
5000|$|A review {{published}} in The Massachusetts Daily Collegian {{was critical of}} the film, noting: [...] "Writer-director Christina Wayne has <b>so</b> <b>little</b> clue <b>about</b> {{how to make a}} film that none of the relationships between seems remotely understandable. Characters float in and out with little connection to each; every scene the viewer needs to reestablish who everyone is in relation to one another." ...|$|R
500|$|Tolkien {{returns to}} the monsters, and regrets we know <b>so</b> <b>little</b> <b>about</b> pre-Christian English mythology; he resorts instead to Icelandic myth, which he argues {{must have had a}} similar {{attitude}} to monsters, men and gods. The Northern gods, like men, are doomed to die. The Southern (Roman and Greek) pagan gods were immortal, so to Tolkien (a Christian), the Southern religion [...] "must go forward to philosophy or relapse into anarchy": death and the monsters are peripheral. But the Northern myths, and Beowulf, put the monsters, mortality and death in the centre. Tolkien is therefore very interested in the contact of Northern and Christian thought in the poem, where the scriptural Cain is linked to eotenas (giants) and ylfe (elves), not through confusion but [...] "an indication of the precise point at which an imagination, pondering old and new, was kindled". The poem is, Tolkien states, [...] "an historical poem about the pagan past, or an attempt at one", obviously not with modern ideas of [...] "literal historical fidelity". The poet takes an old plot (a marauding monster troubling the Scylding court) paints a vivid picture of the old days, for instance using the Old Testament image of the shepherd patriarchs of Israel in the folces hyrde (people's shepherd) of the Danes.|$|E

The purpose was to find out what inspired them {{to become part of the}} high fashion embroidery industry and what choices guided their career path...|$|R

Why do so many LIS researchers show <b>so</b> <b>little</b> curiosity <b>about</b> the context within which information is produced and used? Why do they neglect this opportunity to demonstrate the importance of information to development? What more do teachers need to communicate about the purpose of bibliometrics and how to apply them in an influential way...|$|R

[...] While Cortina defeated the Texas Rangers, the U.S. Army thereafter subdued him. Thompson noted that <b>little</b> is included <b>about</b> Cortina in history books because [...] "history is written by the winners." ...|$|R

Ray Jackendoff’s book draws together current thought from mainstream generative grammar and from more recent thinking on the function of the mind. In integrating these areas, Jackendoff illuminates the interfaces between language and other functions of the mind, {{and at the same time}} helps define the scope of contemporary linguistic inquiry...|$|R
