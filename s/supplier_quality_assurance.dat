The Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) uses a comprehensive, inclusive, and iterative approach to risk management. It follows the Government and DoD risk management premise of using a five-step approach to risk management and the basic idea of identifying and assessing key processes/systems whose risk, either through probability or potential impact, offers the most cause for concern from a performance, schedule, or cost perspective. It employs current information technology, Risk Assessment and Management Program (RAMP) to provide consistency, commonality, access, and comparability to its risk management process. Performance and schedule, product support and <b>supplier</b> <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> for product quality, and delivery were the areas of highest risk for DCMA.

40|$|Problem statement: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{identify}} the extent to which Information Technology (IT) has been used to support TQM in order to identify the role of IT in implementing Total Quality Management (TQM). The primary emphasis of this study was on how IT provides help and supports in TQM processes rather than on TQM performance. This has many policy implications for different firms that are welling to enhance the role of IT in different aspects of their TQM. Approach: The questionnaire survey was used as the data collection method. Data were analysed using SPSS programme. This study is limited only to the managers of operations departments in different companies at Sohar Industrial Estate in Oman. Results: The results of the research indicate that the usage of IT is not the same among the different TQM dimensions. The highest level of IT support was used in information and analysis, output quality assurance and important innovation.

40|$|This project {{involves}} innovating {{the way the}} <b>Quality</b> <b>Assurance</b> organization at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) {{tracks the}} receiving inspection of JPL Critical Items (JCI) procured from <b>suppliers.</b> The <b>Quality</b> <b>Assurance</b> organization uses a Microsoft Access based front-end to enter items into an inspection queue. The current design has grown {{to be much more}} than was expected when the inspection queue system was created in 2007. The goal is to migrate to a web based solution that will allow the handling of more data, multiple input interfaces, and customizable display options. This has been achieved by implementing a divided tables scheme, the use of ColdFusion programming language, and the usage of Web 2. 0 technologies such as AJAX and jQuery. These updates will allow for future expansion as well as the standardization of inspection queues for the <b>Quality</b> <b>Assurance</b> organization. When engineers and scientists order flight hardware, they cannot use it straight away. After a spacecraft or a satellite has been launched, it will be impossible to repair; therefore, the parts used must be inspected {{to make sure they are}} operating correctly and within the required specifications. The task of inspecting these JPL Critical Items (JCI) falls on the <b>Quality</b> <b>Assurance</b> organization. One of the tools the receiving inspection group uses is a database to maintain a queue of inspections that need to be done and of inspections that have been completed. The current Access interface has worked well but increased amounts of data, multiple input interfaces, and changes to how data is handled have made it necessary to seek a new way of organizing items for inspection. In addition, the different inspection groups have recently been merged and each has different ways of keeping track of inspection information. The ultimate goal is for the new group to have one shared inspection queue and website. To achieve this goal, I have been working with Ian Luczon of Procurement <b>Quality</b> <b>Assurance</b> and 3 Myers Hawkins, another intern, to not only create the new queue for receiving inspection but also a central web portal for the newly combined inspection group...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} thesis, we propose and {{investigate}} {{a new approach}} to diagnose the effects of the various degradation mechanisms, including thermal degradation at hot spots, winding deformations due to the mechanical forces from short circuit currents, partial discharges due to local electric field surges, and increased moisture levels in the cellulose insulation due to decomposition, that affect electric power transformers during their normal operation in an electric power grid. Although the proposed diagnostics method can in principle be used to detect various degradation mechanisms mentioned above, we focus in the present thesis on mechanical deformations of transformer winding structures. Such mechanical deformations are most often caused by mechanical forces from short circuit currents, but they may also be caused by initial manufacturing errors and inconsistencies not detected by the power transformersâ€™ <b>suppliers</b> <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> processes. We model a transformer winding surrounded by the transformer-tank wall and the magnetic core as a two-dimensional parallel plate waveguide or as a three-dimensional coaxial waveguide, where one metallic boundary (plate or cylinder) represents the wall of the transformer tank and the other metallic boundary (plate or cylinder) represents the iron core that conducts the magnetic flux. In between there is a set of parallel or coaxial conductors representing the winding segments. The new principle proposed in the present thesis is to insert a number of antennas into a transformer tank to radiate and measure microwave fields interacting with metallic structures and insulation. The responses from the emitted microwave radiation are expected to be sensitive to material properties that reflect the changes caused by any harmful deterioration processes mentioned above. Specifically, we investigate the mechanical deformations of transformer winding structures by determining the locations of the individual winding segments or turns, using measurements of the scattered fields {{at both ends of the}} winding structure. We solve the propagation problem using conventional waveguide theory, including mode-matching and cascading techniques. The inverse problem is solved using modified steepest-descent optimization methods. The optimization model is tested by comparing our calculated scattering data with synthetic measurement data generated by the commercial program HFSS. A good agreement is obtained between the calculated and measured positions of winding segments for a number of studied cases, which indicates that the diagnostics method proposed in the present thesis couldbe potentially useful as a basis for the design of a future commercial on-line winding monitoring device. However, further development of the theoretical analysis of a number of typical winding deformations, improvements of the optimization algorithms and a practical study with measurements on an actual power transformer structure are all needed to make an attempt to design a commercial winding monitoring device feasible.

40|$|Purpose â€“ This paper aims to {{identify}} {{what is needed to}} enhance academic <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> in a university, with specific efforts to reduce the risks associated with ritualised <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> practices. Design/methodology/approach â€“ The aspects to enhance academic <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> efforts in managerial universities are identified through a thematic analysis of the literature. Findings â€“ It was found that the very nature of managerialism caused <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> effort to lose its meaning and become a ritual for compliance only. Subsequently, five aspects were identified to enhance academic <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> in a university: establishing <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> in the unique context of the institution; ensuring that the efforts of policy makers are aligned with those of policy users; <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> based on sound auditing principles without excessively monitoring performance; building a quality culture where <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> is practiced in an enabling environment; and allowing <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> practices to be adaptable. Practical implications â€“ The aspects identified are particularly important for <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> practitioners, developers of <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> processes and academics at universities to enable enhancement of academic <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> practices. Originality/value â€“ This paper argued that the nature of managerialism caused <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> to lose its meaning. The abundance of <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> tasks, forms and processes do not protect the institution against reputational risks, and <b>quality</b> <b>assurance,</b> as practiced presently, was found to be intrinsically risky.

40|$|What is <b>quality</b> <b>assurance?</b> What is {{the purpose}} of higher {{education}} and how does it affect the way <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> is carried out? What value can be placed on <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> and could it enhance a studentâ€™s learning outcome? This research takes a reflective and critical look at these questions amidst the disparagement of <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> and problems issuing from practice. Aside from definitional issues, <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> has not fulfilled its expected purpose, which for all intents hinges on compliance and improvement. It is hoped that understanding the prevailing interpretation of <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> by regulators, a better grasp of the controverted issues could emerge and a renewed understanding of the meaning of <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> stimulated. Using the methods of in-depth interview and analysing relevant documents, this thesis explored the extent to which <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> agents in Nigeria and South Africa engage with the epistemological basis of <b>quality</b> <b>assurance.</b> I highlighted deficiencies that offer compelling arguments for reforming the mechanism. I employed an emic and etic perspective and an interpretist approach underpinned by hermeneutics. Diametrically opposed to the essential nature of <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> are the external control of <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> and the mistaken view that <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> is the preserve of a particular group. Also dysfunctional is the endowment of <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> with attributes from industry such as appropriating the concepts of quality control and auditability. Where accountability dominates, emphasis on improvement is not given equal priority. Besides, focussing on compliance yields compliant sinners causing unethical behaviour and declining standards to be prevalent in universities and among students. Nonetheless, <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> is valued and has brought some improvement albeit extracted under duress. The internalisation of the essential nature of <b>quality</b> <b>assurance,</b> and not just quality as a seven â€“letter word or it misrepresentation as minimum standard, requires a more strategic approach. My original contribution to knowledge is the proposal of a mechanism for <b>quality</b> <b>assurance,</b> which is neither prescriptive nor presuming upon a political mandate.

40|$|BACKGROUND. The {{introduction}} of <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> and medical audit {{has been an}} important development in general practice. However, the {{introduction of}} such programmes does not necessarily mean they are implemented by general practitioners. AIM. A study was undertaken to describe the problems and requirements perceived by general practitioners in relation to the implementation of <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> and medical audit in general practice. METHOD. Interviews were carried out with a stratified sample of 120 Dutch general practitioners. Knowledge, acceptance and application of <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> and medical audit activities were investigated, and perceived problems and requirements in implementing <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> and audit activities were explored. RESULTS. General practitioners in the Netherlands were generally positive towards <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> activities, but had little experience of carrying out such activities. The most frequently mentioned obstacles to implementing <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> activities concerned lack of time, colleagues' negative attitudes and fear of assessment and criticism by colleagues. Requirements for implementing <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> included having regular meetings with colleagues about <b>quality</b> <b>assurance,</b> having information on the aims and methods of <b>quality</b> <b>assurance,</b> having data from other practices with which to compare performance, having support in data collection, in audit in the practice and in setting up local peer review, and having financial support. The most important factor predicting the actual application of <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> activities was found to be knowledge of specific <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> activities. CONCLUSION. Well-designed programmes for the implementation of <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> and medical audit, using a variety of different interventions, have to be developed. Such programmes should include the training of professionals in the concepts and methods of <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> as well as the provision of financial support for <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> activities...|$|R
