5|$|After {{the death}} of her parents in 1890, Bonstelle went to New York City, and in 1891 she joined the company of Fanny Janauschek, with whom she toured for a season. In 1892 she worked as an {{understudy}} and chorus member in Augustin Daly's company, but the season left her exhausted. However, in 1893 she married the actor Alexander Hamilton Stuart, who was twenty years older than her and Janauschek's leading man. Happily married, together they worked in Philadelphia's Forepaugh <b>Stock</b> <b>Company</b> for two years, before moving to Rochester, where Bonstelle played various roles and became an established leading lady. She was the leading lady of Philadelphia's Standard <b>Stock</b> <b>Company</b> during the 1898–99 season. Stuart died in 1911; Bonstelle would never remarry.|$|E
5|$|In 1899, {{while playing}} with the Biancke Sisters, Bonstelle {{produced}} Heimat by Hermann Sudermann. This was its first performance in the United States, and only the second in English. Later she {{received a letter from}} Sudermann in which he thanked her for performing his work. Her career as a manager and director began around 1900 when Jacob J. Shubert offered her the management of a <b>stock</b> <b>company</b> in Rochester. This company, the Lyceum <b>stock</b> <b>company,</b> based at Rochester's Lyceum Theater, included some prominent actors and future stars, such as Orrin Johnson, Margaret Wycherly and Charles Hutchison.|$|E

40|$|Using a new dataset on firms privatized in the Czech Republic from 1993 to 1996, we show that, {{even after}} {{controlling}} for size and structure, voucher-privatized joint <b>stock</b> <b>companies</b> perform worse than firms with concentrated shareholdings {{that had to be}} purchased for cash, i. e., limited liability companies and foreign joint <b>stock</b> <b>companies.</b> We argue that static asset stripping, or tunneling in Czech parlance, was combined with dynamic looting of the Akerlof and Romer (1993) type because these same joint <b>stock</b> <b>companies</b> had privileged access to soft credit from state controlled banks. Although we do not have direct evidence of looting, we show that liabilities increased at a much faster rate in joint <b>stock</b> <b>companies</b> than i...|$|R

40|$|As the {{governance}} of financial institutions is becoming an important issue, there are many papers empirically investigating {{the governance}} issues of banks, which are <b>stock</b> <b>companies.</b> However, cooperative structured financial institutions (co-ops), which have a unique governance structure different from <b>stock</b> <b>companies,</b> play a substantial role in the Japanese banking markets, and, therefore, it is worth examining whether some governance scheme developed for <b>stock</b> <b>companies</b> are effective at cooperative financial institutions. Our {{results showed that the}} presence of outside directors at co-ops (“Shinkin Banks”) contributes to an improvement in efficiency. ...|$|R

5|$|In January 1837, Smith {{and other}} church leaders created a joint <b>stock</b> <b>company,</b> called the Kirtland Safety Society, {{to act as}} a quasi-bank; the company issued bank notes {{capitalized}} in part by real estate. Smith encouraged the Latter Day Saints to buy the notes, and he invested heavily in them himself, but the bank failed within a month. As a result, the Latter Day Saints in Kirtland suffered intense pressure from debt collectors and severe price volatility. Smith was held responsible for the failure, and there were widespread defections from the church, including many of Smith's closest advisers. After a warrant was issued for Smith's arrest on a charge of banking fraud, Smith and Rigdon fled Kirtland for Missouri in January 1838.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} divided in three parts. It {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} determining, for tax reasons, the aggregate net income of the greek <b>stock</b> <b>companies</b> (societes anonymes). The systematic methods commonly used to ascertain tax liability of <b>stock</b> <b>companies</b> are methods that are usually based on taxpayer’s books and accounts and methods of presumptive taxation that involve the use of indirect means {{in order to avoid}} tax evasion. The aforementioned systematic methods are presented through current tax legislation and analysis of relevant tax jurisprudence of the national courts. The thesis approaches theoretically relevant legal senses including the compatibility of specific provisions of the greek tax legislation with the Constitution of Greece. Advantages, shortcomings and difficulties associated with the methods used to ascertain tax liability of <b>stock</b> <b>companies</b> are pointed out and analyzed for their legal implications within the scope of the principal of taxpayers’ equity in EU. A comparative analysis of the tax systems of <b>stock</b> <b>companies</b> within the EU is carried out as the greek tax system, which is deemed as out-of-date and non-productive, is influenced by them and, often, assimilates specific practices and proposals without carefully considering possible ramifications. Finally, the third part is devoted to the efforts of the European Committee that aim to achieve harmonization in estimating the tax base of <b>stock</b> <b>companies</b> throughout the EU. The thesis concludes with suggestions and ad hoc proposals aiming to the improvement of the greek tax system (as far as greek <b>stock</b> <b>companies</b> are concerned). ...|$|R

Malmö FF early expressed their desire to buy the stocks of Peab and Erling Pålsson to reduce rent on the stadium and increase profits. On 27 April 2012, {{it was announced that}} Malmö FF were close to buying the full 25% of stocks owned by Erling Pålsson and 25% of the stocks owned by Peab, increasing their own share to 75% and leaving Peab with a 25% share. On 1 May 2012, Malmö Stad granted the bailment needed for Malmö FF to buy the stocks. The deal, worth 90 million kronor, was finalised on 13 June 2012. The long-term goal for Malmö FF is to buy the remaining 25% of the stocks to fully own Swedbank Stadion.|$|E

While in Missouri, Washington wrote poetry and contributed to local newspapers. He returned to Virginia later in the 1850s. While in Virginia, Washington again applied for a military office in March 1855 under an expansion in the Regular Army after Congress added two new regiments to protect the large additional territory obtained from Mexico. By December 1855, Washington was in Kanawha County where he established a joint <b>stock</b> <b>company</b> to promote emigration to Kansas.

5|$|The 7000 {{series of}} cars, {{currently}} being built by Kawasaki Heavy Industries Rolling <b>Stock</b> <b>Company</b> of Kobe, Japan are being delivered for on-site testing during winter 2013, and first entered service April 14, 2015 on the Blue Line. The new cars {{are different from}} previous models in that while still operating as married pairs, the cab in one car was eliminated, {{turning it into a}} B car. The new design allows for increased passenger capacity, elimination of redundant equipment, greater energy efficiency, and lower maintenance costs. The National Transportation Safety Board investigation of the fatal June 22, 2009, accident led it to conclude that the 1000 series cars are unsafe and unable to protect passengers in a crash. As a result, on July 26, 2010, Metro voted to purchase 300 7000 series cars to replace the remaining 1000 series cars. An additional 128 7000 series cars were also ordered to serve the new Silver Line to Dulles Airport (64 for each phase). In May 2013, Metro placed another order for 100 7000 series cars, which will replace all of the 4000 series cars. On July 13, 2015, WMATA used their final option and purchased an additional 220 7000 series railcars for fleet expansion, bringing the total number of 7000 series railcars on order to 748.|$|E

The {{purpose of the}} thesis is to analyze the main theoretical aspects of the acquisition of own shares in joint <b>stock</b> <b>companies</b> {{and the provision of}} financial assistance by limited liability <b>companies</b> and joint <b>stock</b> <b>companies</b> in the Czech Republic. The thesis is divided into two main parts. The aim of such outline is to comprehensively describe two main legal mechanisms which are relevant to the scope of my thesis: (a) the acquisition of own shares in joint <b>stock</b> <b>companies,</b> and (b) the provision of financial assistance. Individual chapters examine in detail relevant legal aspects of both main parts. Chapter one of the first part focuses on inconsistency between Czech and other language versions of the Directive 2006 / 68 /EC. Chapter two deals with an amended version of the Czech Commercial Code in eight sub-chapters where the relevant legal provisions are addressed; it draws an attention to provisions where transposition was not done accurately and appropriately. Chapter three analyzes legal conditions related to the acquisition of own shares in joint <b>stock</b> <b>companies</b> under the amended legislation. Chapter four, five and six of the first part investigate corporate matters related to the acquisition of own shares in joint <b>stock</b> <b>companies.</b> As it is [...] ...|$|R
