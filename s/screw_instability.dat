40|$|<b>Screw</b> <b>instability</b> of the {{magnetic}} field connecting a rotating black hole (BH) with its surrounding disk is discussed based {{on the model of}} the coexistence of the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) process and {{the magnetic}} coupling (MC) process (CEBZMC). A criterion for the <b>screw</b> <b>instability</b> with the state of CEBZMC is derived based on the calculations of the poloidal and toroidal components {{of the magnetic}} field on the disk. It is shown by the criterion that the <b>screw</b> <b>instability</b> will occur, if the BH spin and the power-law index for the variation of the magnetic field on the disk are greater than some critical values. It turns out that the instability occurs outside some critical radii on the disk. It is argued that the state of CEBZMC always accompanies the <b>screw</b> <b>instability.</b> In addtition, we show that the <b>screw</b> <b>instability</b> contributes {{only a small fraction of}} magnetic extraction of energy from a rotating BH.

40|$|A toy {{model for}} gamma-ray burst supernovae (GRB-SNe) is {{discussed}} {{by considering the}} effects of <b>screw</b> <b>instability</b> of magnetic field in black hole (BH) magnetosphere. The <b>screw</b> <b>instability</b> in the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) process (henceforth SIBZ) can coexist with the <b>screw</b> <b>instability</b> in the magnetic coupling (MC) process (henceforth SIMC). It turns out that both SIBZ and SIMC occur inevitably, provided that the following parameters are greater than some critical values, i. e., (i) the BH spin, (ii) the power-law index describing the magnetic field at the disk, and (iii) the vertical height of the astrophysical load above the equatorial plane of the rotating BH. The features of several GRBs are well fitted. In our model the durations of the long GRBs depend on the evolve time of the half-opening angle. A small fraction of energy is extracted from the BH via the BZ process to power a GRB, while a large fraction of energy is extracted from the BH via the MC process to power an associated supernova. In addition, the variability time scales of tens of msec in the light curves of the GRBs are fitted by two successive flares due to SIBZ. Comment: 22 pages, 5 figures.

40|$|This is a {{prospective}} clinical study carried on 69 patients with proximal femoral fractures treated with SHS at KTH,Sahiroon and Ibnkhaldoon hospitals {{during the period}} between May 2002 - June 2003. Only fortyeight patients were followed {{for six months and}} included in the analysis of the final results. The mean age of the 48 patients was 57. 27 years. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the functional outcome and to study the complications and their risk factors in patients with PFF treated with SHS. patients were males and 24 were females. Out of the 48 patients high-energy injury (RTA, fall from a height and gun shot) was the cause of fracture in twenty six patients while low-energy injury (fall at home) was the cause in twenty two patients. All of the fractures in female patients were intertrochanteric or basicevical and 16 of them aged above 60 years sustained a low-energy injury (fall at home). From the 29 male patients high-energy injury in 23 patients, of whom 18 patients were aged below 50 years. Thirty three fractures were Intertrochanteric, eight were basicervical, two were intracapsular and five were subtrochanteric. By the end of the first - 4 - postoperative week weight-bearing as tolerated was initiated by 36 of the 48 patients, and most of the patients who had delayed postoperative ambulation had an associated injury. The overall failure of fracture healing or fixation at six months was 14. 6 % (7 cases); cutting-out of the lag screw from the femoral head was the cause in 57 % of the instances. Superior position of the lag <b>screw</b> and <b>instability</b> of the fracture were found to be highly significant determinant factors that the implant will cut-out, but the age and walking ability had no significant influence. Penetration of the screw into the hip was seen in one patient, another patient showed extrusion of the screw (> 25 mm) and the third patient presented with refracture distal to the implant. Three out of the four patients with the cut-out screw had not united at six months, with one patient with intracapsular fracture further complicated by avascular necrosis. 40 (83. 3 %) patients had excellent to satisfactory functional results and eight patients showed poor functional results. At six months only few patients retuned to their prefracture functional status. Male patients showed better functional outcome than female patients at six months follow-up...|$|R
40|$|Reconstruction of {{unstable}} syndesmotic injuries is not trivial, {{and there}} is no generally accepted treatment guidelines. Thus, there still remain considerable controversies regarding diagnosis, classification and treatment of syndesmotic injuries. Syndesmotic malreduction is the most common indication for early re-operation after ankle fracture surgery, and widening of the ankle mortise by only 1 mm decreases the contact area of the tibiotalar joint by 42 %. Outcome of ankle fractures with syndesmosis injury is worse than without, even after surgical syndesmotic stabilization. This may be due to a high incidence of syndesmotic malreduction revealed by increasing postoperative computed tomography controls. Therefore, even open visualization of the syndesmosis during the reduction maneuver has been recommended. Thus, the most important clinical predictor of outcome is consistently reported as accuracy of anatomic reduction of the injured syndesmosis. In this context the TightRope® system is reported to have advantages compared to classical syndesmotic <b>screws.</b> However, rotational <b>instability</b> of the distal fibula cannot be safely limited by use of 1 or even 2 TightRopes®. Therefore, we developed a new syndesmotic InternalBraceTM technique for improved anatomic distal tibiofibular ligament augmentation to protect healing of the injured native ligaments. The InternalBraceTM technique was developed by Gordon Mackay from Scotland in 2012 using SwiveLocks® for knotless aperture fixation of a FiberTape® at the anatomic footprints of the augmented ligaments, and augmentation of the anterior talofibular ligament, the deltoid ligament, the spring ligament and the medial collateral ligaments of the knee have been published so far. According to the individual injury pattern, patients can either be treated by the new syndesmotic InternalBraceTM technique alone as a single anterior stabilization, or in combination with one posteriorly directed TightRope® as a double stabilization, or in combination with one TightRope® and a posterolateral malleolar screw fixation as a triple stabilization. Moreover, the syndesmotic InternalBraceTM technique is suitable for anatomic refixation of displaced bony avulsion fragments too small for screw fixation and for indirect reduction of small posterolateral tibial avulsion fragments by anatomic reduction of the anterior syndesmosis with an InternalBraceTM after osteosynthesis of the distal fibula. In this paper, comprehensively illustrated clinical examples show that anatomic reconstruction with rotational stabilization of the syndesmosis can be realized by use of our new syndesmotic InternalBraceTM technique. A clinical trial for evaluation of the functional outcomes has been started at our hospital...|$|R
40|$|Three energy {{mechanisms}} invoking large-scale {{magnetic fields}} are incorporated {{in a model}} to interpret jet production in black hole (BH) systems, i. e., the Blandford-Znajek (BZ), the magnetic coupling (MC) and Blandford-Payne (BP) processes. These energy mechanisms can coexist in BH accretion disc based on the magnetic field configurations constrained by the <b>screw</b> <b>instability,</b> provided that the BH spin and the power-law index indicating the variation of the magnetic field at an accretion disc are greater than some critical values. In this model the jets are driven by the BZ process in the Poynting flux regime and by the BP process in the hydromagnetic regime, being consistent with the spine/sheath jet structure observed in BH sources of stellar and supermassive size.

40|$|When {{magnetic}} field lines thread a rotating black hole’s horizon and connect with remote astrophysical loads, the rotational {{energy of the}} black hole can be extracted through the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. Due to {{the rotation of the}} black hole, the {{magnetic field}} lines are twisted and toroidal components are generated. So poloidal electric currents are induced and the black hole’s rotational energy is transported to the astrophysical loads through Poynting flux. The Blandford-Znajek mechanism has been considered to be a possible process for powering extragalactic jets. In this paper we show that due to the <b>screw</b> <b>instability</b> of magnetic field, the toroidal components of the magnetic field, and thus the poloidal currents, cannot exceed the limits given by the Kruskal-Shafranov criterion. This significantly lowers the power of the Blandford-Znajek mechanism when the loads are far from the black hole. So the Blandford-Znajek mechanism can only work efficiently within the neighborhood of the black hole. The implications of the results for the scenario of extragalactic jets powered by the Blandford-Znajek mechanism are discussed.

40|$|The <b>screw</b> <b>instability</b> of {{magnetic}} field is {{a mechanism for}} prohibiting a generation of strongly twisted field lines in large scales. If it can work in black hole magnetospheres, the global axisymmetric structure and the main process of energy release will be significantly influenced. In this paper, we study the instability condition {{in the framework of}} the variational principle, paying special attention to a stabilizing effect due to field-line rotation against the screw-unstable modes satisfying the well-known Kruskal-Shafranov criterion. The basic formulation for the stability analysis of rotating force-free fields in Kerr geometry is provided. Then, for the practical use of the analytical method, the stationary configuration is assumed to be cylindrical, and we treat the long-wave mode perturbations excited at large distances from the central black hole, where the strength of gravity becomes negligibly small. This allows us to derive clearly the new criterion dependent on the rotational angular velocity {{of magnetic}} field lines, and the implications of the results obtained for magnetic activities of jets driven by a black hole are briefly discussed.

40|$|The eventuality of {{recurrent}} fractures on the adjacent level of fractured vertebra is becoming prevalent in this era. To date, {{the underlying cause}} of this phenomena is either due to low bone quality or adverse geometrical changes of the vertebral body, {{as a result of}} osteoporosis and vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). To further investigate the determinant factor of this phenomenon, an image based finite element analysis (FEA) was used to scrutinize the biomechanical response of spines that have been afflicted by different types of spinal deformities, namely; wedge-shaped, fish-shaped and plana-shaped vertebrae. The evaluation was made based on its structural integrity in accordance to stress and strain distributions, and fracture risks prediction. These findings were then further corroborated by evaluating other associating factors such as kyphotic deformity angle and bone density distribution in order to find the underlying cause of this symptom. The results showed that the low bone density due to osteoporosis has become the dominant factor in inciting the risks of subsequent fractures on the adjacent vertebrae. This is based on the contradictory relation between the number of the failure elements distributions and the degree of the kyphotic deformity angle, as described by the wedge-shaped vertebral fracture model. Obviously, the most highly structural deformed vertebra still could withstand any kinds of high input loads, provided that its structural formation is still intact and has not severely affected by osteoporosis. The high incidence of subsequent fractures following Balloon Kyphoplasty (BKP) in both the augmented and adjacent vertebrae is quickly becoming a clinically unresolvable complication. The underlying cause of this phenomenon is still unknown and to date medical practitioners are still unable to explain the fundamental cause of this phenomenon. To verify this claim, an image-based finite element analysis was used to investigate the effectiveness of BKP treatment of pre-operative and post-operative osteoporotic spine models. The three-dimensional (3 D) non-linear finite element (FE) models of the thoracolumbar spine (T 11 -L 3) were developed from CT-scan images. The biomechanical responses were evaluated based on the models’ load sharing mechanisms, load transfer mechanisms, stiffness recovery, stability, and kyphotic deformity restoration. The margin of safety for each of the models was evaluated under incrementally increased loads (1 - 10 kN). This margin would be determined based on the fracture risk evaluation in accordance to the associated onset fracture load. The results showed that the BKP procedures {{play a significant role in}} enhancing the structural integrity of the treated spine by lowering the effect of the bone fracturing and optimizing the biomechanical alterations up to its pre-fracture level. However, the phenomenon of high incidence of vertebral bone failures on the augmented and its neighboring vertebrae indicates that the osteoporosis severity is the most influential factor in determining the sufficiency of the BKP treatment. Cage subsidence, pedicle <b>screw</b> loosening and <b>instability</b> are the most prevalent posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) -related complications. These may be attributed to interrelated mechanical, biomechanical and environmental factors. Current advancement in medical treatment has paved the way for the implementation of unilateral cages in an oblique position to overcome unintended mechanical and clinical shortcomings. To verify this claim, an imagebased finite element analysis (FEA) was used to evaluate several factors; cage subsidence, screw loosening and PLIF construct stability via stress profiles, fracture risk prediction and range of motion (ROM) evaluations in the different type of cage materials and cage orientations. Obviously, obliquely-placed unilateral fusion cage constructs with PI exhibited the most reliable biomechanical constructs by showing the smallest ROM and producing the minimal distortion stress at the cage-endplate and pedicle screw-bone interfaces. Moreover, these results also showed good agreement with the results obtained using fracture risks assessments by showing the lower numbers of deformation elements at the both contact interfaces in normal and traumatic events. In conclusion, biocompatible cage materials and structural symmetry are the most important criteria in achieving biomechanical advantage in PLIF surgery...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} model to explain a puzzling 3 : 2 {{frequency}} ratio of high frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HFQPOs) in black hole (BH) X-ray binaries, GRO J 1655 - 40, GRS 1915 + 105 and XTE J 1550 - 564. In our model a non-axisymmetric magnetic coupling (MC) of a rotating black hole (BH) with its surrounding accretion disc coexists with the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) process. The upper frequency is fitted by a rotating hotspot near the inner edge of the disc, which is produced by the energy transferred from the BH to the disc, and the lower frequency is fitted by another rotating hotspot somewhere away from the inner edge of the disc, which arises from the <b>screw</b> <b>instability</b> of the magnetic field on the disc. It {{turns out that the}} 3 : 2 frequency ratio of HFQPOs in these X-ray binaries could be well fitted to the observational data with a much narrower range of the BH spin.

40|$|A toy {{model for}} {{magnetic}} extraction of energy from black hole (BH) accretion disk is discussed {{by considering the}} restriction of the <b>screw</b> <b>instability</b> to the magnetic field configuration. Three mechanisms of extracting energy magnetically are involved. (1) The Blandford-Znajek (BZ) process {{is related to the}} open magnetic field lines connecting the BH with the astrophysical load; (2) the magnetic coupling (MC) process is related to the closed magnetic field lines connecting the BH with its surrounding disk; and (3) a new scenario (henceforth the DL process) for extracting rotational energy from the disk is related to the open field lines connecting the disk with the astrophysical load. The expressions for the electromagnetic powers and torques are derived by using the equivalent circuits corresponding to the above energy mechanisms. It turns out that the DL power is comparable with the BZ and MC powers as the BH spin approaches unity. The radiation from a quasi-steady thin disk is discussed in detail by applying the conservation laws of mass, energy and angular momentum to the regions corresponding to the MC and DL processes.

40|$|Association of the {{high-frequency}} quasi-periodic oscillation (HFQPO) pairs {{with the}} broad Fe K line in XTE J 1550 - 564 and GRO J 1655 - 40 is discussed {{based on the}} magnetic coupling (MC) of a rotating black hole (BH) with its surrounding disc. The 3 : 2 HFQPO pairs are interpreted {{by virtue of the}} inner and outer hotspots arising from non-axisymmetric magnetic field, where the inner hotspot is produced by a torque exerted at the inner edge of the disc, and the outer hotspot is created by the <b>screw</b> <b>instability</b> of the large-scale magnetic field. The very steep emissivity index is created predominantly by the torque exerted at the inner edge of the disc. It turns out that the 3 : 2 HFQPO pairs observed in the two sources can be fitted by tuning several model parameters, such as the BH spin, and the main features of this model lie in three aspects. (1) The condition for only one HFQPO is discussed based on the two mechanisms for producing the 3 : 2 HFQPO pairs, (2) an explanation is given for a systematic shift away from disc dominated flux with the increasing power-law flux as the HFQPO pairs shift from the higher to lower frequencies, which is consistent with the analysis given by Remillard et al. (2002), and (3) the BH spin in XTE J 1550 - 564 and GRO J 1655 - 40 can be estimated by combining the 3 : 2 HFQPO pairs with the very steep emissivity index required for fitting the broad Fe K emission line.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundThe best {{surgical}} {{strategy for}} extra-capsular proximal femoral fractures (PFFs) is controversial in the elderly. Poor bone quality and neck <b>screw</b> <b>instability</b> can adversely affect the results with currently available fixation devices, which predominantly consist in dynamic hip screw-plates and proximal reconstruction nails. HypothesisThe helical blade of the proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFN-A™) achieves better cancellous bone compaction in the femoral neck, thereby decreasing {{the risk of}} secondary displacement. Materials and MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed consecutive cases of PFN-A™ fixation performed between 2006 and 2008 in 102 patients (75 females and 27 males) {{with a mean age}} of 84. 9 ± 9. 5 years (range, 70 – 100 years). Functional outcomes were assessed using the Parker Mobility Score. ResultsMean follow-up in the 102 patients was 21. 3 ± 17. 5 months (4 – 51 months). Fracture distribution in the AO classification scheme was A 1, n= 45; A 2, n= 41; and A 3, n= 16. At last follow-up, Parker Mobility Score values in the 65 survivors were 0 – 3, n= 35; 4 – 6, n= 11; and 7 – 9, n= 19. Fracture union was consistently achieved, after a mean of 10. 3 ± 3 weeks. Blade back-out allowed by the device design occurred in 16 (15. 7 %) patients but caused pain due to screw impingement on the fascia lata in only five patients (of whom two underwent reoperation). Cephalic blade cut-out was noted in three (2. 9 %) patients, of whom one required reoperation because of acetabular penetration. Two hardware-related fractures were recorded. DiscussionThe new PFN-A™ device ensures reliable fixation with low mechanical complication rates. Although our data do not constitute proof that a helical blade is superior over a neck screw, they suggest a decreased rate of construct failure and may serve as a basis for a comparative study.

40|$|Objective. To assess {{risk factors}} оf pedicle <b>screw</b> <b>instability</b> after {{decompression}} and fusion {{in patients with}} degenerative lumbar spine disease. Materials and methods. This is a prospective non-randomized study, the results of 130 surgical interventions with pedicle instrumentation in patients with degenerative lumbar spine diseases were studied. Minimal follow up period accounts for 18 months. Before intervention computed tomography (CT) was applied and cancellous bone radiodensity was measured. Patients were treated with nerve root decompression and pedicle screw fixation stand-alone or with lumbar interbody fusion. During follow-up period computed tomography was applied and cases with evidence of pedicle screw loosening were detected. Radiodensity of cancellous bone, extension of fixation, extensiveness of decompression, application of interbody fusion, incomplete vertebra body reduction and heterogeneity of studied group were taken into account as potential risk factors of implant instability development. The correlation between pedicle screws loosening rate and mentioned predictors was estimated using logistic regression analysis. Results. Radiodensity of vertebra body cancellous bone getting decreased, the increase number of fixed levels and extensiveness of facet joints and ligaments resection {{are associated with the}} increased risk of a screw loosening development. Laminectomy, interbody fusion, altered biomechanics associated with incomplete vertebra body reduction and L 5 –S 1 segment included into fixed zone did not have a significant influence on pedicle screws loosening rate. Bias related to heterogeneity of studied group was also insignificant. Goodness-of-fit of estimated general logistic regression model: № 2 = 67, 57851; p < 0, 0001. This model classified correctly 81, 5 % cases with sensitivity and specificity of 77, 4 % and 85, 3 % respectively. Conclusion. Radiodensity of a vertebra cancellous bone, number of fixed levels and extensiveness of facet joints and ligaments resection during decompression are significant predictors for pedicle screws loosening development. The detected risk factors should be taken into account in preoperative planning especially in elderly patients. </p...|$|E
