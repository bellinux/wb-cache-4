40|$|This paper {{reflects}} the essential role of supportive infrastructure {{in the mass}} implementation of electric drive vehicle technology. A focus {{is placed on the}} development of comprehensive systems that provide efficient and diverse recharging solutions for vehicle drivers. Mass adoption of electric mobility will reflect advances in the vehicles themselves, their infrastructural networks, and their position in the automotive market. Progress in these areas is highly related, and mandates coordinated design efforts. This paper discusses current problem areas, ongoing developments, and future trends in the design and development of charging systems for battery electric vehicles. The application of infrastructures that are simple, familiar, and context-sensitive is essential to promote consumer confidence and thereby enable successful market penetration. <b>Specific</b> <b>requirements</b> <b>and</b> <b>conditions</b> for the design of infrastructure systems for electric mobility are presented.

We {{consider}} sustainable and deterministic QoS a {{key ingredient}} for providing virtualization and hence introduce an end-to-end Quality of Service mechanism for Grid bulk data transfers. Our mechanism enables per-flow guarantees and efficiently utilizes available resources without requiring any router support {{except for the}} provisioning of a single high class traffic aggregate. This is attained by taking the <b>specific</b> <b>requirements</b> <b>and</b> environment <b>conditions</b> in common Grids into account. We document simulation results which illustrate how guarantees are realized by applying admission control, and by uniformly using a max-min fair congestion control mechanism for all flows...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Bulk data {{transfers}} in Grids require end-to-end performance guarantees {{as well as}} {{a reliable}} and efficient transfer mechanism. The <b>specific</b> traffic <b>requirements</b> <b>and</b> environment <b>conditions</b> need {{to be taken into account}} as the focus of resource utilization is shifting from power to network resources in data Grids. This article investigates network resource sharing in Grids, especially data Grids. The scheduling of advance resource reservations in Grids was proven to be NP-complete. The existing heuristics for the scheduling of bandwidth requests do not take communication and computation delays and communication overheads into account which are involved in the reliable transfers of such reservations. This paper proposes a flexible, reliable and realistic QoS Mechanism which maximizes acceptance rate and network resource utilization and demonstrates the performance improvement by documenting results of simulations. ...|$|R

40|$|On 4 th and 5 th of February 2014, 18 {{researchers}} from 13 countries attended the workshop in Graz, Austria. The workshop {{was supported by}} COLOSS, University of Graz, the Dean of the Faculty of Science and the Austrian Research Association. An authorized questionnaire that was drafted before the workshop was finalised during the workshop after necessary extended discussion. The questionnaire will be published on the COLOSS website to make it available to all interested countries. Deadlines and important dates for the 2014 monitoring and submission of data were established. The use of additional databases (meteorological and land use) which could be relevant for {{better understanding of the}} past and future loss data collected using the COLOSS questionnaire was explored, with input from specialists from other fields. So far only winter losses have been considered, however in southern countries summer losses appear to be more important. This issue was discussed and a decision was taken to further explore summer losses in specific southern areas ideally using a randomized approach. The general feeling was that the monitoring group currently acts as an European entity which attracts other countries, but which may require to develop a stronger European profile. For COLOSS, {{it would be a good}} initiative for similar entities to be developed independently in other continents by honey bee researchers based in those continents. Further exploration of <b>specific</b> <b>requirements</b> <b>and</b> <b>conditions</b> is needed. The issue of compliance with the EU regulations on data protection was discussed for future implementation. A jointly authored publication on winter 2012 - 2013 colony losses which is in press and soon to appear in the Journal of Apicultural Research was welcomed by the participants of the workshop and would be accompanied by an IBRA press release to publicise this article...|$|E
40|$|Privacy is {{a concept}} with real life ties and implications. Privacy {{infringement}} {{has the potential to}} lead to serious consequences for the stakeholders involved, hence researchers and organisations have developed various privacy enhancing techniques and tools. However, there is no solution that fits all, and there are instances where privacy solutions could be misused, for example to hide nefarious activities. Therefore, it is important to provide suitable measures and to make necessary design tradeoffs in order to avoid such misuse. This short paper aims to make a case for the need of careful consideration when designing a privacy solution, such that the design effectively addresses the user requirements {{while at the same time}} minimises the risk of inadvertently assisting potential offenders. In other words, this paper strives to promote “sensible privacy ” design, which deals with the complex challenges in balancing privacy, usability and accountability. We illustrate this idea through a case study involving the design of privacy solutions for domestic violence survivors. This is the main contribution of the paper. The case study presents <b>specific</b> user <b>requirements</b> <b>and</b> operating <b>conditions,</b> which coupled with the attacker model, provide a complex yet interesting scenario to explore.

40|$|The {{construction}} of underground infrastructures for both transport purposes (roads, railways, and metro) to face and solve {{the need of}} urban mobility but also for mountain, sea straits or rivers crossing and for water transportation (clean or sewage water) has today a relevant role in modern society. In this context, it assumes a particular importance the {{construction of}} tunnel linings in a shorter time <b>and</b> in safe <b>conditions</b> to remain within the project budget; full face mechanized tunnels are consequently under considerably improving {{all over the world}} with the adoption of bigger and more powerful machines; in this case, the linings are usually made of precast segments. Parallel to the improvement of mechanized methods of excavation, it is evident the need to also develop the behavior of these tunnel elements in terms of bearing capacity, crack control and water-tightness. To this aim, in the last two decades, Fiber Reinforced Concrete (FRC) was progressively adopted in several tunnel projects. The benefits related to the inclusion of fiber reinforcement in the cementitious composites are several but, the most important, is the noticeable increase of the post-cracking tensile residual properties. Moreover, the fiber reinforcement enables a considerable boost of the tunnel elements production process. The enhancement of the general structural behavior together with the improvement of the industrialization process of tunnel segments are probably the two main key-factors of the continuously growing use of FRC in precast tunnel linings. Within this framework, the aim of this report is to provide advances in the design of FRC tunnel lining in accordance with the objectives of the International Tunnelling Association (ITA) prescribed in Section II of the Statutes of the ITA (ITA, 1976). In fact, even if general standards or recommendations concerning the design of FRC elements are already available, the needed to shed some new light on the <b>specific</b> <b>requirements</b> <b>and</b> loading <b>conditions</b> of tunnel elements is considerable. This document was conceptually agreed during the meeting of ITA Working Group 2 in Budapest, 2009. The first early draft document was presented in Vancouver, 2010. After several discussions and meetings the current version was completed and presented herein...|$|R
40|$|Because {{primary school}} {{teachers}} {{are the most}} important persons in integration of a child with special needs into elementary school system I wanted to research their viewpoint about integration in my diploma. Efficiency of inclusion of such children hugly depends on teacher's willingness, his practical and theoretical knowledge and competences for work with children with special needs. In theoretical part I introduced the development of inclusion in the international field, in Slovenia and {{in the area of the}} Savinja valley. In a theoretical part of diploma I describe inclusion, I write about children with special needs, their <b>specific</b> <b>requirements,</b> about <b>conditions</b> <b>and</b> obstacles in implementation of inclusion. I write about positive and negative compehension of inclusion, inclusive changes in the teachers' work, about team work and individual programs. The intention of empirical part is to research and introduce primary theachers' views on the inclusion of the children with special needs in the Savinja valley and to establish factors that define their viewpoints. I chose a survey as an instrument. A sample included five primary schools in the Savinja valley and 125 teachers all together – class teachers and the subject teachers. The purpose of the research is to find out and to suggest some propositions for elimination of eventual deficiencies and to improve the practice of inclusion. The results of the research showed that the biggest obstacle in integration is a lack of teachers' professional knowledge in this field. Consequently the teachers' viewpoint on inclusion is discouraging. More than half of the teachers who participated in the survey believed that children with special needs should have been educated in specialized institutions. Teachers don't see their work with these pupils as a burden, but they agree they should have more professional trainings in this field, both at primary level (university study) as well as at the secondary level (seminars). ...|$|R
