50|$|The table summarises {{the types}} of {{projectiles}} in service with RML heavy guns in 1902, (and probably, by the late 1880s for the guns existing at that time). All polygroove guns exclusively fired <b>studless</b> projectiles with automatic gas-checks. All Woolwich groove guns except 7 inch guns, fired both studded and <b>studless</b> projectiles. The studded projectiles had attached gas-checks while the <b>studless</b> projectiles had automatic gas-checks. The 8 inch gun only fired one <b>studless</b> projectile, a <b>studless</b> pointed common shell. The 7 inch guns fired exclusively studded projectiles without gas-checks.|$|E
50|$|However, <b>studless</b> {{construction}} also introduces disadvantages. <b>Studless</b> {{construction is}} not immediately intuitive, requiring the builder to think {{five or six}} steps ahead. While studded construction follows the classic bottom-to-top building pattern, <b>studless</b> construction requires building inside-to-outside. Studdless constructions are noted to often be more flexible than an equivalent studded construction. This {{is due to the}} amount of flex in the clip-based pins which are used to attach studdless parts together, whereas studs provide a more rigid friction fit.|$|E
50|$|In general, all {{marks of}} a {{particular}} gun shared the same <b>studless</b> ammunition. Also, the <b>studless</b> ammunition for a particular gun used the same automatic gas-check, except for 9 inch and 10 inch guns which had some marks with Woolwich rifling, and others with polygroove. In these cases there was one automatic gas-check for all Woolwich marks, and a different automatic gas-check for all polygroove marks. The 8 inch 46 cwt and 70 cwt howitzers shared the same <b>studless</b> ammunition, but required different automatic gas-checks for their Woolwich and polygroove rifling respectively.|$|E

5000|$|The primary {{advantage}} of <b>studless</b> construction is {{the addition of}} new construction methods that were previously unavailable. Liftarms are exactly 1 unit width high, in contrast to studded beams, which are a non-integer multiple of one unit. It can be awkward to use studded beams in vertical structures because {{it is necessary to}} insert plates between the studded beams {{in order to get the}} holes to line up. <b>Studless</b> beams allow greater flexibility when building in multiple dimensions, while remaining compatible with [...] "classic" [...] studded beams. Some builders also believe that models constructed with <b>studless</b> beams look nicer than their studded counterparts.|$|E

5000|$|The {{projectiles}} of RML 9 inch guns Marks I-V (the Woolwich rifled guns) {{had several}} rows of [...] "studs" [...] which engaged with the gun's rifling to impart spin.

50|$|As of 2008, {{an updated}} version of the {{original}} differential has been released, optimised for <b>studless</b> construction.|$|E
50|$|This was a second-generation RML gun, {{equipped}} with polygroove rifling and firing only <b>studless</b> ammunition with automatic gas-checks for rotation.|$|E
50|$|Although liftarms (<b>studless</b> beams) {{have been}} present in Technic sets since 1989, the change from {{primarily}} studded to primarily <b>studless</b> construction around the year 2000 represented a major paradigm shift and has been quite controversial. Initially liftarms were use primary as styling parts, or to create smaller sub-assemblies which attached to a studded chassis. With {{an increasing number of}} liftarm designs introduced, a tipping point was reached around the year 2000 with models introduced primarily constructed from liftarms instead of traditional beams.|$|E
50|$|Automatic gas-checks {{were used}} with <b>studless</b> {{ammunition}} in both Woolwich and polygroove rifled guns. They were {{otherwise known as}} “Rotating Gas-Checks” or “EOC Gas-Checks”. They were called “automatic” because they could be loaded into the barrel separately from the projectile, and automatically became firmly attached to the projectile on firing. They were called rotating gas-checks because {{they were able to}} rotate the projectile, enabling the use of <b>studless</b> projectiles. They were called EOC gas-checks, because they were developed by the Armstrong company which owned EOC.|$|E

50|$|Gas-checks were {{attachments}} to ammunition that revolutionised {{the performance of}} RML heavy guns. The first generation of RML heavy guns began entering service in about 1865. They all had Woolwich rifling and relied on studs on the projectiles for rotation. Gas-checks were first introduced in 1878 or soon after. They significantly reduced wear on the guns while also increasing their range and accuracy. Before long, <b>studless</b> ammunition was being manufactured for these guns, using gas-checks for projectile rotation. Gas-checks also facilitated a switch to the second generation of RML guns which used polygroove rifling and only supported <b>studless</b> ammunition.|$|E
5000|$|... 46- and 70 cwt guns {{differed}} {{in number and}} type of rifling grooves so studded projectiles were only available for 46 cwt guns, and different automatic gas checks were required for <b>studless</b> projectiles.|$|E
50|$|An {{automatic}} gas-check was {{a copper}} plate that automatically attached {{itself to a}} specially-designed <b>studless</b> projectile of rifled muzzle-loading ("RML") artillery, sealing the escape of gas between the projectile and the barrel and imparting axial rotation to the projectile.|$|E

50|$|Fig 4 shows a 10-inch <b>studless</b> Palliser shell Mk II with {{automatic}} gas-check. The gas-check {{is the same}} as the one in Fig 3. However, in contrast to Fig 3, the protrusion on the base of the shell in Fig 4 is not part of the shell, but is instead a wrought iron disc attached to the shell by the screw plug. Initially, all <b>studless</b> shells 9 - 17.72 inches, including Palliser shells, were made in one piece as in Fig 3. These shells were identified as Mark I. However, it was found that casting Palliser shells in brittle metal in one piece was extremely difficult, especially for smaller calibres, and that the protusions were liable to chipping during handling. As a result, later Palliser shells 9 - 12.5 inches were made in two pieces as in Fig 4, and identified as Mark II. The separate protrusions were made from wrought iron, cast steel or malleable cast iron.|$|E

50|$|Cylinders {{look like}} pumps, {{but they are}} the outputs of the energy, rather than the inputs. There are five {{versions}} of cylinders. The Generation 1 cylinders came in two lengths, only had one input and worked on pressure or vacuum. The Generation 2 cylinders have 2 inputs (and come in studded, <b>studless,</b> and small versions), and work on pressure in both directions. They allow pushing and pulling, depending on which input air is pumped into.|$|E

This range {{is typical of the}} ammunition in use with Woolwich-grooved guns of 9 inches or larger after the mid-1880s. These guns no longer fired studded ammunition without gas-checks. Instead there were two sets of ammunition available, namely: older studded ammunition with attached gas-checks Mk II, and newer <b>studless</b> ammunition with automatic gas-checks. Case ammunition was neither studded nor required gas-checks.|$|E

Instead there were two sets of ammunition available, namely: older studded ammunition with attached gas-checks Mk II, and newer <b>studless</b> ammunition with automatic gas-checks. Case ammunition neither was studded nor required gas-checks. Also by this time, attached gas-checks Mk I as shown in image 2 had been superseded by attached gas-checks Mk II.|$|E
50|$|Fig 3 {{shows the}} base of a 10-inch <b>studless</b> common shell Mk I with {{automatic}} gas-check in place but not attached i.e. as {{it would be in the}} gun after ramming but before firing. The centre of {{the base of}} the projectile has a circular flat-topped protrusion with undercut sides. The outside of the base is curved and covered with two circular grooves and 47 tapered radial ridges. The collar has 7 projections corresponding to the rifling grooves. On firing, the powder gas pressure forces the copper gas-check into the undercut in the side of the protrusion, the two circular grooves, and the 47 gaps between the tapered radial ridges, permanently attaching the gas-check to the shell. The gas pressure also forces the collar outwards against the rifling, creating a gas seal. The radial ridges prevent rotation of the gas-check on the base of the projectile, forcing the projectile to rotate.|$|E
50|$|Over the years, {{several new}} pieces were {{introduced}} in this line as well. The new pump was spring based, and could only be operated by hand, which limited pneumatic power to how fast it could be manually pumped. This obviously limited the power of pneumatic circuits. So in 1992, LEGO introduced two new pieces; a small pump and a small cylinder. The small pump {{did not have a}} spring on it, and it was designed to be operated by a motor, which would allow for continuously-running pneumatic creations. As of 2011, the small pump has only appeared in one set — 8868 Air Tech Claw Rig (1992) (found on Peeron) — and a few parts sets (no longer available). A new version of the small pump was released in Lego set 8110 Unimog U400 (2011). At 2L, this pump's stroke is 1/3 longer than the old one's 1.5L, 'L' being the LEGO unit of a stud. This made it much easier to use in <b>studless</b> construction.|$|E
50|$|The first RML heavy {{guns were}} {{introduced}} into British service in about 1865. By 1878, 11 models of Woolwich rifled guns had been introduced, ranging from 7 inches to 12.5 inches. Unfortunately, Woolwich rifling {{had a major}} defect, namely, that hot powder gas escaping around the ammunition ("Windage") caused excessive barrel erosion, especially in the rifling grooves. Extensive research was performed in the early 1870s to find a solution, and by 1878 two types of gas-checks had been designed. Both gas-checks were made of copper with a little added zinc. They were, in effect, shallow cups of about the same diameter as the ammunition that were attached {{to the base of}} the ammunition. When the gun was fired, the powder gas pressure forced the sides of the cup into the rifling grooves, creating a gas seal. It was immediately found that gas-checks also increased the range of guns, and provided greater accuracy. It was also realised that gas-checks were capable of rotating the ammunition, removing the need for studs. This facilitated the use of polygroove rifling, which used a lot of shallow grooves, in place of the Woolwich system which used only a few deeper grooves. Polygroove rifling was less detrimental to the strength of the guns. Also, <b>studless</b> ammunition was stronger and flew more accurately than studded ammunition. Shell strength was particularly important for armour-piercing ammunition.|$|E

Finite element calculations were performed {{in order to determine the}} stress levels in <b>studless</b> and stud chain links as well as to evaluate the critical regions of the links. A study was also developed based on the concept of critical volume associated with the material volume susceptible to a certain critical crack size. The results showed that the <b>studless</b> chain links present a higher critical volume than that related to the stud chain links, fact that confirms the beneficial effect of the stud. According to the crack assessment procedure the critical crack length is smaller for the stud chain links. However, the critical association between volume and crack size turns the <b>studless</b> chain links more susceptible to brittle fracture than the stud chain links...|$|E

The introduction of ESC in passenger cars has been very positive for traffic safety. An ESC system's function is however dependent on forces between road and tyres. Thus, {{it is not clear}} how important the tyre road grip performance is for the ESC system to function properly. Field tests on ice with six different drivers were used for assessing how well an ESC system can help the driver in a specific critical situation during slippery road conditions, namely a sudden double lane change. Four different <b>studless</b> winter tyres were used in the study: one <b>studless</b> winter tyre for Nordic conditions, and three <b>studless</b> winter tyres for central European conditions.

40|$|Abstract: This work {{deals with}} the design and {{in-house}} operational results of a novel Automated Ultrasonic Inspection System (ASCIS) for <b>studless</b> chain links with diameter ranging from 111 to 185 mm, conceived and developed by INTERLAB Ingeniería Electrónica (IIE) for VICINAY Cadenas, a major industry devoted to manufacture of chains for both the shipbuilding industry and offshore exploration. The system employs an arrangement of transmitting and receiving probes specifically designed to detect possible flaws in the weld area of each link, while providing the additional benefits of an automated inspection system. Introduction: Chains used in mooring systems for offshore applications are subject to harsh mechanical and environmental conditions, which call for tight observance of strict quality [1], [2] standards during manufacturing to guarantee continued performance throughout their operational life. In <b>studless</b> chains, each link is made from a steel bar bent to join its ends throug...|$|E
40|$|Mooring chain can {{twist in}} {{response}} to torque generated in the adjacent elements of a mooring, or even be inadvertently installed in a twisted condition. This paper explores the effect of initial twist on the static strength and fatigue life of <b>studless</b> chain. It reports test results for 16 mm <b>studless</b> chain (with similar proportions as the much larger chains now employed in hydrocarbon production vessels) with known levels of initial twist subject to axial tensile loading. Twist levels of up to 24 ° per link were examined. The results were generally better than had been expected. There was little scatter in the results, giving confidence in the test procedures. The effect of initial twist on static strength was modest, with a maximum strength loss of about 4 % at 18 ° twist per link. The effects of initial twist on fatigue life were also small. Indeed, some twist seemed to improve fatigue performance, perhaps because the contact between links was displaced from the region of high residual (compressive and tensile) stress resulting from proof loading during manufacture. While {{the results of these}} small scale tests suggest that twist levels up to 24 ° per link were not detrimental, other practical reasons remain for continuing to minimize twist in mooring chain. Furthermore, caution should be applied in extrapolating these results to predict the effect of twist in full scale offshore mooring chains...|$|E

The offshore environment data of Jeju south sea collected from Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Administration (KHOA) {{are used as}} environmental conditions for hydrodynamic analysis. A semi-submersible floating wind turbine system is considered based on Offshore Code Comparison Collaborative Continuation (OC 4) DeepCWind platform and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) 5 MW class wind turbine. Catenary mooring with <b>studless</b> chain is chosen as the mooring system. Important design decisions such as how large the nominal sizes are, how long the mooring lines are, how far the anchor points are located, are demonstrated in detail. Considering ultimate limit state and fatigue limit state based on 100 -year return period and 50 year design life, respectively, long-term predictions of breaking strength and fatigue are performed...|$|E
40|$|Mooring {{systems of}} {{floating}} structures consist of long lengths of chain, rope or wire, {{or a combination}} of these elements. As part of a station-keeping system, the mooring lines have to keep the movements of the structure to a minimum. The mooring lines have to withstand the loads acting on the moored structure in addition to loads acting directly on the mooring components. If a mooring line fails, the floating structure can lose station and cause severe damage to structures and environment as well as economic losses and loss of lives. Awareness of corrosion, wear, fatigue and relevant loading conditions during design will improve the design and extend the service life of the structural components. The overall goal {{of this study is to}} find out how mooring chains work as structural components. The theory part of the report includes a study of offshore loading conditions, different types of mooring systems, causes of mooring line failure, failure detection of mooring lines and fatigue. However, there is a special focus on mooring chains. Offshore standards and recommended practices provide common chain link designs and minimum mechanical properties of links, but in order to study chain links as structural components, the stresses and strains are of importance. Normal stresses in chain links are calculated analytical using classic beam theory and curved beam theory. In addition, three-dimensional elastoplastic finite element models are applied for a more detailed investigation on the stress distribution in chain links. The presented analyses are limited to chains subjected to pure tension, although torsion and bending due to interlink friction may occur. Both stud links and <b>studless</b> links are analyzed in the computer program Abaqus 6. 12. Mooring components as chain links enter in operation with a residual stress field created by the required proof test. However, traditional design of mooring chains does not consider the presence of residual stresses [1 - 3]. This study shows that residual stresses play an important role. When residual stresses are added to the operational stresses, the resulting maximum tensile stress is 3. 65 and 3. 30 times the nominal stress for stud links and <b>studless</b> links respectively. The maximum tensile stress is located at the link surface at the crown section. Such tensile stress concentrations at the surface of a material are unfavorable due to fatigue crack propagation. Both whole links and worn links are modeled with Abaqus 6. 12, using solid elements. The worn links have a reduction of cross-sectional diameter of 2. 6 % to 13. 2 %. Wear will reduce the cross-sectional area and cause some sharp edges, but at the same time increase the contact area. The positive effects of wear seem to surpass the negative effects of wear when the wear is moderate. </p...|$|E
