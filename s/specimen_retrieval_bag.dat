40|$|Background: To {{offer an}} easily {{produced}} and cost-effective <b>specimen</b> <b>retrieval</b> <b>bag</b> {{that can be}} used to reduce the cost of laparoscopic surgery. Methods: From January 2005 to October 2009, 135 patients underwent laparoscopic surgery for adrenalectomy or prostatectomy, during which a homemade <b>specimen</b> <b>retrieval</b> <b>bag</b> was used. The retrieval bag was produced from a large sterile surgical glove, 2 - 0 nylon thread, and 1 - 0 RB- 1 needle Vicryl thread. A purse-string suture at the opening of the bag was made using the nylon thread, and the bottom of the bag was double-tied using the tail of the Vicryl thread. The bag was introduced into the peritoneal cavity via a 12 -mm port, and the specimen was enclosed with the use of two laparoscopic instruments. The bag was then extracted by extending the port incisional wound. Results: We used a homemade retrieval bag to extract specimens from 110 patients who underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and 25 patients who underwent laparoscopic adrenalectomy. The procedure was performed safely, and no bags were broken. No complications were observed after the operations such as wound infection, ileus, or intestinal adhesion. In our experience, our homemade endobag can be easily used by surgeons to extract specimens from the abdominal cavity. The total cost of hospitalization was also reduced for the patients. Conclusion: The homemade <b>specimen</b> <b>retrieval</b> <b>bag</b> is cost-effective and useful for the retrieval of intact specimens. It is also easy to make and safe to use...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the feasibility and surgical outcome of a novel technique for laparoscopic removal of the fallopian tube using a homemade <b>retrieval</b> <b>bag</b> through a 10 -mm transumbilical or 5 -mm transabdominal port. Materials and Methods: A total of 40 women with ruptured ectopic tubal pregnancy were randomized into a 10 -mm transumbilical group (n = 20) or a 5 -mm transabdominal group (n = 20) according to the port used for specimen removal. Fallopian tube removal was performed using a new method based on the use of a homemade surgical glove as a <b>retrieval</b> <b>bag.</b> Results: There were no differences in the demographic characteristics between the two groups. The <b>specimen</b> <b>retrieval</b> time was significantly shorter in the transumbilical group than in the transabdominal group. Post-operative pain scores, assessed using a visual analog scale, were similar between the groups. No cases of rupture of the homemade <b>retrieval</b> <b>bag</b> were observed. Conclusion: The laparoscopic removal of the fallopian tube through the 10 -mm umbilical port using a homemade <b>retrieval</b> <b>bag</b> is associated with shorter operative time than retrieval through a 5 -mm abdominal port.

40|$|Introduction. With the {{widespread}} adoption of laparoscopic and robotic surgery, {{more and more}} women are undergoing minimally invasive surgery for complex gynecological procedures. The rate-limiting step is often the delivery of an intact uterus or an unruptured adnexal mass. To avoid conversion to a minilaparotomy for <b>specimen</b> <b>retrieval,</b> we describe a novel technique using an Anchor Tissue <b>Retrieval</b> System <b>bag</b> in conjunction with a pneumo-occluder to easily retrieve large specimens through a colpotomy incision. Surgical Technique. After completion of the robotic-assisted hysterectomy, the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries were too large to be retrieved intact despite multiple attempts of delivery through the colpotomy incision. Prior to resorting to a minilaparotomy or morcellation of the specimen, a 15 [*]mm anchor <b>retrieval</b> <b>bag</b> with a pneumo-occluder was placed through the vagina and the intact specimen was easily placed inside the bag under direct visualization and removed through the colpotomy incision intact. Conclusion. We routinely utilize this technique to retrieve hysterectomy specimens that are not readily delivered through the colpotomy incision and find this technique to be safe, highly efficient, and cost effective when {{there is a need to}} remove large intact specimens during minimally invasive surgery...|$|R

The case of a 7 -year-old girl with an inflamed peritoneal inclusion cyst with unusual right paracolic localization and congenital lower extremity superficial and deep venous valve agenesis is presented. Inflammation of the peritoneal inclusion cyst {{was responsible for the}} signs of acute abdomen and subsequent presentation at our center. The cystic structure was initially diagnosed using ultrasonography, and its complete extent (8 cm x 6. 5 cm x 4 cm) was evident after magnetic resonance imaging. The minimal access approach was opted for to resect the entire cyst from the lateral border of the ascending colon.

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} the technique and report perioperative outcomes of transvaginal contained extraction of surgical specimens at laparoscopic myomectomy. Design: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. Setting: Two Italian referral centres for gynaecological minimally invasive surgery. Population: Consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic myomectomy. Methods: Tissue extraction was accomplished following laparoscopic myomectomy in a <b>specimen</b> <b>retrieval</b> <b>bag</b> via a posterior colpotomy incision. If morcellation was necessary, this was performed extracorporeally, using a scalpel within the specimen retrieval pouch, whose edges were exteriorised through the vaginal introitus. Main outcome measures: Intra- and postoperative complications. Results: A total of 316 women underwent transvaginal specimen retrieval with enclosed manual morcellation. The mean myomectomy specimen weight was 154 ± 128 g, {{and the mean}} operative time was 79 ± 26 minutes. No intraoperative complications occurred related to the specimen extraction or morcellation technique, or from rupture of the retrieval bag. Two (0. 6 %) women had a haemoperitoneum that spontaneously resolved and 16 (5. 1 %) had fever postoperatively. The final pathological diagnosis was benign in all cases. At the 30 -day follow-up, no pelvic infection, vaginal dehiscence, or complaints of dyspareunia were recorded. Conclusions: Contained transvaginal extraction of fibroid specimens can be performed safely and efficiently in most women undergoing laparoscopic myomectomy. This technique represents a valuable minimally invasive alternative to intracorporeal morcellation.

40|$|Background and Objectives: We present 2 {{cases of}} laparoendoscopic single site surgery (LESS) {{splenectomy}} performed with a conventional laparoscope and instruments, {{and the use}} of a novel internal retraction device. Methods: One patient underwent LESS splenectomy for idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP), and a pediatric patient with sickle cell disease underwent LESS splenectomy and cholecystectomy. In each case, a 2 -cm vertical incision was made {{within the confines of the}} umbilical ring, and a SILS port (Covidien, Norwalk CT) inserted. A 5 -mm, 30 -degree laparoscope and standard 5 -mm instruments were used. After isolation of the splenic hilum, one 5 -mm trocar of the SILS port was upsized to 12 mm, and a laparoscopic stapler was used to divide the splenic artery and vein. An internal retractor consisting of a laparoscopic bulldog clamp with a hook attachment was used to retract the gallbladder, and to secure the <b>specimen</b> <b>retrieval</b> <b>bag</b> during splenic extraction, which eliminated the need for a fourth trocar. Results: Total operative time was 160 minutes for the LESS splenectomy, and 216 minutes for the LESS splenectomy and cholecystectomy. Both procedures were successfully completed with conventional instrumentation and a SILS port, without the need for additional incisions or trocars. No complications occurred, and both patients had an uneventful recovery. Conclusions: LESS splenectomy is a feasible procedure that can be performed safely. Although articulating instruments and laparoscopes may offer advantages, they are not necessary for performing LESS splenectomy...|$|E

30|$|A unique {{feature of}} the da Vinci Xi system is camera port hopping. The camera may be {{switched}} to the second caudal trocar {{at this point in}} the operation to facilitate visualization of pelvic anatomy for distal ureterectomy and bladder cuff excision. The distal ureter is carefully dissected as it courses over the iliac vessels in order to prevent injury. Ureteral dissection is carried inferiorly to the level of the bladder hiatus and the superior vesicle pedicles can be preserved. The bladder is filled with sterile water and the detrusor muscle is dissected until identification of the bladder mucosa. Bladder cuff excision is performed by incising the mucosa of the bladder in a circumferential manner. An absorbable suture is preplaced at the edge of the cystotomy before completely excising the ureter and bladder cuff in order to maintain traction and control. The bladder defect is then closed in two layers with absorbable, running suture. The integrity of the repair is tested by filling the bladder with sterile water via the Foley catheter. If a leak is identified, additional sutures may be placed until no further extravasation is observed. The nephroureterectomy specimen is placed into a laparoscopic <b>specimen</b> <b>retrieval</b> <b>bag.</b> The renal bed and pelvis are reexamined to ensure hemostasis as the insufflation pressure is lowered to 5  mmHg. A drain is placed and the robot is undocked and all trocars are removed. The specimen may be extracted by making a midline or Gibson incision incorporating the most caudal port.|$|E

40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONDevelopments in {{the field}} of {{minimally}} invasive surgery have led to interest in NOTES (natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery). Even as technologies continue to evolve and develop, interest in some of the advantages of <b>specimen</b> <b>retrieval</b> transvaginally has been roused and we describe a case of combined laparoscopic splenectomy and hysterectomy with transvaginal <b>retrieval</b> of both <b>specimens.</b> PRESENTATION OF CASEPatient underwent laparoscopic splenectomy and robot-assisted hysterectomy with transvaginal delivery of specimens. Total operative time was 245 min with no complications. Closure of the colpotomy was achieved laparoscopically. Post-operative course was unremarkable. Patient has done well clinically at 18 months follow-up except for an episode of post-coital spotting, which resolved spontaneously. DISCUSSIONWe explored the technical feasibility of concurrent laparoscopic splenectomy and hysterectomy along with transvaginal retrieval of both solid organs without morcellation. We wanted to illustrate the fact that transvaginal organ extraction may be performed safely in a community or district hospital with standard instruments without incurring additional cost, morbidity or increased operating time. CONCLUSIONTransvaginal <b>specimen</b> <b>retrieval</b> was technically easy to accomplish. Our patient has not experienced any infectious complications or sexual dysfunction to date.
