40|$|The {{scope of}} the Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses was {{expanded}} with the 2008 survey to cover a more complete section of the U.

Estimates covering nearly 18. 5 million <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> <b>government</b> workers show that these public sector employees experienced a higher incidence rate of work-related injuries and illnesses than their private industry counterparts. This Spotlight on Statistics compares characteristics of injury and illness cases in <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> <b>government</b> with those in private industry, highlighting incidence rate trends in selected <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> <b>government</b> industries <b>and</b> examining injury and illness rates and cases that occurred in <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> <b>government</b> workplaces in 2011...|$|R

40|$|Accrual {{measures}} of pension-related compensation <b>and</b> wealth of <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> <b>government</b> workers This paper develops a simple method {{to convert the}} published normal costs and actuarial liabilities of <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> <b>government</b> retirement systems to the economic accruals and liabilities needed to estimate the compensation and property income components of the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA). It also standardizes the measures using a common discount rate. The method is applied to data for the years 2000 to 2006 to generate a set of national <b>and</b> <b>state</b> estimates. Using a 6 % discount rate, the accrued liability of <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> <b>government</b> retirement systems is about 8 % lower than the actuarial liability and benefit accruals are about 38 % higher than normal costs. Adopting accrual accounting for <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> <b>government</b> pension plans will have a large effect on the NIPA, adding $ 93 billion (or about 0. 8 %) to its measure of personal income in 2006. 2 Accrual {{measures of}} pension-related compensation <b>and</b> wealth of <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> <b>government</b> workers...|$|R

5|$|A major {{aspect of}} civil liberties {{progress}} after World War II was the undoing centuries of racism in federal, <b>state,</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> <b>governments</b> an effort generally associated with the Civil Rights Movement. Several civil liberties organizations worked together for progress, including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the ACLU, and the American Jewish Congress. The NAACP took primary responsibility for Supreme Court cases (often led by lead NAACP attorney Thurgood Marshall), with the ACLU focusing on police misconduct, and supporting the NAACP with amicus briefs. The NAACP achieved a key victory in 1950 with the Henderson v. United States decision that ended segregation in interstate bus and rail transportation.|$|E

Another high-profile victory for the Republican minority was the State and Local Fiscal Assistance act. Passed in 1972, the act established a Revenue Sharing program for <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> <b>governments.</b> Ford's leadership was instrumental in shepherding revenue sharing through Congress, and resulted in a bipartisan coalition that supported the bill with 223 votes in favor (compared with 185 against).|$|E

5|$|Following World War II, a {{nationwide}} movement pressed {{to return to}} pre-war society {{as quickly as possible}} in the U.S. When combined with the increasing national paranoia about communism and psychoanalytic theory that had become pervasive in medical knowledge, homosexuality became an undesired characteristic of employees working for the U.S. government in 1950. Homosexuals were thought to be vulnerable targets to blackmail, and the government purged its employment ranks of open homosexuals, beginning a widespread effort to gather intelligence about employees' private lives. <b>State</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> <b>governments</b> followed suit, arresting people for congregating in bars and parks, and enacting laws against cross-dressing for men and women.|$|E
5|$|Hours after Isabel made landfall, President George W.

Nonetheless, the Prince George's County government demanded in May 1978 that WMATA chose the Suitland-Parkway-to-Rosecroft route instead, and WMATA agreed to the change. In August 1978, WMATA's Board of Directors recommended {{to the federal government}} and its partner <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> <b>governments</b> that the entire -long (160.9 kilometres) Metrorail system be fully built—a proposal that included immediate construction of the Archives, Waterfront, Navy Yard – Ballpark, and Anacostia stations. WMATA announced in November 1978 that it had secured funding to build the Green Line from Gallery Place to Waterfront and that construction was nearly complete on this portion of the line, but that funding did not exist to push the line from Waterfront to Anacostia. Nonetheless, Metro reiterated that it intended to complete the extension to Anacostia Station by late 1983.|$|E
