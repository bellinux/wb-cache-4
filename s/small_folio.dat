5000|$|The {{original}} lithographs shared similar {{characteristics in}} inking and paper, and adhered to folio sizes. Sizes {{of the images}} were standard (trade cards, very <b>small</b> <b>folios,</b> <b>small</b> <b>folios,</b> medium folios, large folios), and their measurement {{did not include the}} title or borders. These sizes are one of the guides for collectors today in determining if the print is an original or not. [...] "Currier used a cotton based, medium to heavy weight paper depending on the folio size for his prints until the late 1860s. From about 1870, Currier & Ives used paper mixed {{with a small amount of}} wood pulp." [...] In addition, Currier's inking process resembled a mixture of elongated splotches and dashes of ink with a few spots, a characteristic that modern reproductions would not possess.|$|R

This paper aims at comparing local feature descriptors and bags of visual words with different classifiers to deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on three plant datasets; AgrilPlant, LeafSnap, and Folio. To achieve this, we study the use of both scratch and fine-tuned versions of the GoogleNet and the AlexNet architectures and compare them to a local feature descriptor with k-nearest neighbors and the bag of visual words with the histogram of oriented gradients combined with either support vector machines and multi-layer perceptrons. The results shows that the deep CNN methods outperform the hand-crafted features. The CNN techniques can also learn well on a relatively <b>small</b> dataset, <b>Folio...</b>|$|R

6000|$|THE TATLER AND THE SPECTATOR. On {{account of}} his talent in writing {{political}} pamphlets, Steele was awarded the position of official gazetteer. While in this position, and writing for several small newspapers, the idea occurred to Steele to publish a paper which should contain not only the political news, but also the gossip of the clubs and coffeehouses, with some light essays on the life and manners of the age. The immediate result--for Steele never let an idea remain idle--was the famous Tatler, the first number of which appeared April 12, 1709. It was a <b>small</b> <b>folio</b> sheet, appearing on post days, three times a week, and it sold for a penny a copy. That it had a serious purpose is evident from this dedication to {{the first volume of}} collected Tatler essays: ...|$|E

50|$|Escalante Discurso was {{a fairly}} <b>small</b> book, 100 <b>folios</b> (i.e., 200 pages in the modern system of page-counting) in octavo with wide margins. It can be conceptually divided into two parts. The first 5 {{chapters}} (folios 1-28) cover the history of Portuguese explorations along the route from the Iberian Peninsula to the South-East Asia. The remaining chapters (chap. 6-16, on folios 28-99) attempt a systematic description of China - its geography, economy, culture etc., to the (rather limited) extent known {{at the time to}} the Europeans (primarily Portuguese). The last folio (100) contains {{a brief description of the}} author's sources.|$|R
25|$|The Ms. M.383, titled Fior di Battaglia, {{is in the}} {{holdings}} of the Morgan Library & Museum in New York City, NY. Novati {{described it as a}} <b>small,</b> thin, vellum <b>folio,</b> pen and ink with gold highlights, and illustrations of sword and lance combat on foot and horseback. Unlike the other surviving manuscripts, the swords and other weapons were enameled in silver, though it has since tarnished to a glossy black. This is the briefest copy of Fiore's work currently known, with only 19 folios; it has a prologue in Italian and four illustrated figures per page in the main body. The figures are accompanied by text that is often identical to that of the Ms. Ludwig XV 13 (excepting differences in spelling), but at times includes additional explanation. The Ms. M.383 is almost certainly longer when it was first written; its text makes reference to sections on poleaxe, dagger, and grappling which are not present in the book's current state. It also refers to a certain play of the sword in one hand which is likewise missing from that section. This manuscript is typically referred to as the 'Pierpont Morgan version' or simply the 'Morgan'.|$|R
6000|$|... § 7. It remains {{only to be}} noticed, {{that the}} {{direction}} of the lamination (or separation into <b>small</b> <b>folio)</b> is, in these rocks, not always, nor even often indicative of the true direction of their larger beds. It is not, however, necessary for the reader to enter into questions of such complicated nature as those which belong to the study of slaty cleavage; and only a few points, which I could not pass over, are noted in the Appendix; but it is necessary to observe here, that all rocks, however constituted, or however disposed, have certain ways of breaking in one direction rather than another, and separating themselves into blocks by means of smooth cracks or fissures, technically called joints, which often influence their forms more than either the position of their beds, or their slaty lamination; and always are conspicuous in their weathered masses. Of these, however, as it would be wearisome to enter into more detail at present, I rather choose to speak incidentally, as we meet with examples of their results in the scenery we have to study more particularly.|$|E
60|$|The {{three books}} were really of very great interest. One was an octavo volume of {{manuscript}} in John Evelyn's own hand, {{the beginning of}} his published diary, written as distinctly as print, in a small, clear character. It can be read just as easily as any printed book. Another was a Church of England prayer-book, which King Charles used on the scaffold, and which was stained with his sacred blood, and underneath are two or three lines in John Evelyn's hand, certifying this to be the very book. It is an octavo, or <b>small</b> <b>folio,</b> and seems to have been very little used, scarcely opened, except in one spot; its leaves elsewhere retaining their original freshness and elasticity. It opens most readily at the commencement of the common service; and there, on the left-hand page, is a discoloration, of a yellowish or brownish hue, about two thirds of an inch large, which, two hundred years ago and a little more, was doubtless red. For on that page had fallen a drop of King Charles's blood.|$|E
60|$|These {{two short}} treatises were found among Mr. Bunyan's papers after his decease. They {{probably}} were intended for publication, like his 'Prison Meditations' and his 'Map of Salvation,' {{on a single}} page each, {{in the form of}} a broadside, or handbill. This was the popular mode in which tracts were distributed; and when posted against a wall, or framed and hung up in a room, they excited notice, and were extensively read. They might also have afforded some trifling profit to aid this poor but eminent servant of Christ in his very limited income. They form two pages in that exceedingly interesting volume of 'The Works of Mr. John Bunyan,' in <b>small</b> <b>folio,</b> 1692. To which is added 'The Struggler,' containing some most valuable facts, relative to the various works, imprisonment and sufferings of the author. The titles to these treatises were added by Mr. Doe, the personal friend of Bunyan, who edited the works and wrote 'The Struggler,' the author having left them without any heading or title. They are very unfinished, and may have been intended as a syllabus or outline of more extended treatises.--GEO. OFFOR.|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at www. springerlink. com???. Copyright Springer. [Full text {{of this article is}} not available in the UHRA]In this paper we introduce a distributed object-based document architecture called DODA in order to illustrate a novel strategy for achieving both high availability and high integrity in the context of open processing distributed between mutually suspicious domains without a common management hierarchy. Our approach to availability is to structure documents into <b>small</b> components called <b>folios</b> {{in such a way as}} to allow the maximum opportunity for concurrent processing, and to allow these components to be freely replicated and distributed. Integrity conflicts are resolved using an optimistic form of control called optimistic integrity control (OIC) applied to recoverable work units. Our approach to security is to shrinkwrap the document components using cryptographic checksums, and to provide a set of building block components called functionaries which a group of users can combine in such a way as to provide each user with a means of ensuring that an agreed notion of integrity is enforced while relying upon a minimum of non-local trust. In particular, we do not rely upon a trusted computing base or a shared system infrastructure. The local availability of document versions and of the resources to process them are completely under local user control. The lack of availability of the functionaries does not have severe consequences, and the presence of mutual suspicion makes it easier to ensure that users can trust the functionaries to provide the intended service. A major benefit of using OIC is that it allows the integration of untrusted components such as filestores and directory servers into the system. In particular, an untrusted soft locking service can be used in order to reduce the number of concurrency conflicts, and untrusted security components can be used to screen out attempted access control violations...|$|R

50|$|Palmer is strangely {{inaccurate}} in {{the following}} addition to Calamy: 'There is a <b>small</b> <b>folio</b> volume of sermons on the whole Epistle of Paul to Philemon, {{with the name of}} William Aspinwall prefixed, which the editor supposes to be by the same person.

Our William Aspinwall (as also Peter Aspinwall, of Heaton, Lancashire) is sometimes confounded with William Aspinwall, the ejected minister of Formby, who afterwards conformed, as well as with a contemporary quaker divine (of the same names) who had been persecuted in New England, and wrote vehemently of his wrongs and tenets.|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{earliest}} printed books of the kind was that issued about 1475 for the Diocese of Constance, of which a rubricated copy {{is to be found}} in the British Museum. It is a <b>small</b> <b>folio</b> in size, of one hundred and twelve leaves, and after the ordinary calendar it supplies summary rules, under thirty-five heads, for drawing up the special calendar for each year according to the Golden Number and the Dominical Letter. Then the Ordo for each of the thirty-five possible combinations is set out in detail. The name most commonly given to these [...] "Pyes" [...] on the Continent was [...] "Ordinarius", more rarely [...] "Directorium Missæ". For example, the title of such a book printed for the Diocese of Liège in 1492 runs: [...] "In nomine Domini Amen [...] [...] [...] Incipit liber Ordinarius ostendens qualiter legatur et cantetur per totum anni circulum in ecclesia leodiensi tam de tempore quam de festis sanctorum in nocturnis officiis divinis." [...] Such books were also provided for the religious orders. An [...] "Ordinarius Ordinis Præmonstratensis" [...] exists in manuscript at Jesus College, Cambridge, and an early printed one in the British Museum. When the use of printing became universal, the step from these rather copious directories, which served for all possible years, to a shorter guide of the type of our modern [...] "Ordo recitandi", and intended only for one particular year, was a short and easy one. Since, however, such publications are useless after their purpose is once served, they are very liable to destruction, and it seems impossible to say how early we may date the first attempt at producing an Ordo after our modern fashion. The fact that at the Council of Trent (Sess. XXIII, De Reform., cap. xviii) it was thought necessary to urge that ecclesiastical students should be trained in the understanding of the computus, by which they could determine the ordo recitandi in each year for themselves, seems to imply that such Ordos as we now possess were not in familiar use in the middle of the sixteenth century.|$|E
