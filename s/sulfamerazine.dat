Certain preliminary studies (Swales, 1944) using <b>sulfamerazine</b> (4 -methyl- 2 -sulfanilamidopyrimidine) and other stud-ies using a mixture of sodium sulfa-merazine 80 percent, 'Sulfathalidine' (phthalylsulfathiazole) 10 percent and sodium carbonate 10 percent (SS 2) (Gra-ham, Hawkins, Swales, Thorp) suggest that this mixture may be of value in the treatment of infections in poultry caused by Eimeria.

40|$|Polymorphic transformations {{are known}} to occur {{as a result of}} many factors, one of the most {{prominent}} being recrystallisation from different solutions. Though other factors have been known to induce polymorphic change, these can include environmental factors and mechanical/physical stress. During many manufacturing processes mechanical stress such as milling or compression can induce polymorphic transformation, as well as environmental effects during storage such as changes in temperature or humidity. In this body of work the solid state transformations of two model polymorphic drugs, <b>sulfamerazine</b> and sulfathiazole, were studied. For this accurate analytical methods were developed for comprehensive polymorphic analysis. Previous studies have shown the effects of mechanical stress on the solid state chemistry of <b>sulfamerazine.</b> It has already been shown that compression during tabletting can cause transformation from <b>sulfamerazine</b> form I (FI) to form II (FII), that cryo-milling can generate amorphous content, and milling at room temperature can transform FI to FII. In this work, methods to prepare bulk FII from FI were reviewed. Both forms I & II of <b>sulfamerazine</b> were monitored during milling at room temperature and low temperatures, achieving the first complete transformation to <b>sulfamerazine</b> 2 ̆ 7 s amorphous phase (FA). FA produced from cryo-milling both FI and FII at different time intervals were compared to determine the optimal method to prepare (FA) for multivariate analysis. This optimal method resulted in the most stable amorphous phase, while taking the least amount of time to prepare. FI, FII and FA were used to prepare binary and ternary mixtures for chemometric models using XRPD, NIR and IR spectroscopy. This gave a novel means to analysis and monitors the solid state transformations of <b>sulfamerazine</b> observed during the room temperature milling and cryo-milling of FI and FII. The shelf-life of FA was also monitored when stored under vacuum at 4 oC and room temperature using these calibration models. For the work with sulfathiazole, low content analysis of different solid sates was used to determine the limitations of a number of analytical techniques such as XRPD, NIR and IR spectroscopy. The analytical method that produced the most accurate calibrations was used in other studies. For the first time the amorphous phase of sulfathiazole was prepared via cryo-milling forms I and III. These produced purer samples of the amorphous phase when compared to samples prepared by the melt quench method. With a successful method to prepare pure samples of the amorphous phase, novel ternary studies containing the amorphous phase of sulfathiazole, and form I and form III were used to create ternary regression models from two different data sets, which were then compared. One ternary study was designed to focus on low content analysis, while the other was designed to focus on whole content analysis.

40|$|Comparative {{studies of}} the absorption, {{excretion}} and blood levels after single doses of sulfadiazine, <b>sulfamerazine</b> and sulfamethazine in man have been re-ported recently (1, 2).

For sulfadiazine, the concentrations found in the plasma when given amounts of drug were present in the body (1, 2) accord with the fact that about 55 per cent of the plasma sulfadiazine is not dialyzable, being bound to plasma protein (3, 4, 5).

40|$|Sulfonamides {{antibiotics}} (SAs) are {{the oldest}} and among {{the most widely used}} antibacterial agent in the world. Due to its low cost and their relative efficacy in controlling some common bacterial related diseases, SAs have been widely used in various sectors. Since huge amount of SAs have been consumed every year, SAs have been released into the environment through various human activities. Among various classes of pharmaceutical, the presence of antibiotics in the environments {{has been one of the}} major concerns due to its ability to develop antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Thus, it is essential to develop an efficient method for the determination of SAs in the environment. The main objective of this study was to develop a multi-functional magnetic MIP for the extraction of SAs. The experiment was started from the computational study to design a suitable monomer for the multi-functional MIP. Based on the crystal structure of sulfamethoxazole (SMO) and dihydropteroate synthase, a serine-based monomer (Monomer- 2) was designed and synthesized for this study. The performance of magnetic serine-based MIP (SMIP) was then compared with magnetic acrylamide-based MIP (AMIP). In this case, serine is an amino acid whereas acrylamide is a common commercially available monomer. The experimental study was started from the preparation of AMIP and followed by the evaluation of the performance of AMIP. The acrylamide-based MIP was imprinted directly onto the surface of MPS-modified MION. The result showed that the obtained AMIP possessed adsorption kinetics with 400 s to reach equilibrium. The results also indicated that the maximum adsorption capacity of 775 μg g- 1 was achieved. Langmuir adsorption isotherm model was found to describe well the equilibrium adsorption data. The results from the iv competitive binding experiment showed that AMIP was not only selective towards sulfadiazine as the adsorption of <b>sulfamerazine</b> was dramatically high. Sulfadiazine and <b>sulfamerazine</b> have almost similar sub-structure where these two compounds were only differentiated by one methyl group. In order to explain this result, computational study was carried out. From different level of calculation with PM 3, HF, and DFT calculation, both sulfadiazine and <b>sulfamerazine</b> showed similar interaction energy and mechanism with acrylamide monomer. This result indicated that, both sulfadiazine and <b>sulfamerazine</b> could have the same binding property in the AMIP. By using the similar approach as AMIP, SMIP was synthesized. As compared to the AMIP, SMIP showed a faster adsorption rate on sulfadiazine with only 200 s to reach equilibrium level. The maximum adsorption capacity of SMIP was around 1547 μg g- 1. This result is in agreement with the computational study. The computational study indicated that Monomer- 2 (serine-based monomer) showed more favorable interaction with template as compared with acrylamide. Importantly, in the selectivity experiment, SMIP showed overwhelming advantage in the recognition of different SAs with the presence of 2 structural unrelated compounds. Therefore, it can be concluded that the multifunctional magnetic MIP can be designed by using computer modelling method.

Sulfadiazine was reduced to 50  % after 1  week, but the remaining residuals were stable {{until the end of}} the trial (32  weeks). The author varied the storage temperature (− 20, 7  °C, room temperature) over a period of 16  weeks. <b>Sulfamerazine,</b> sulfamethoxypyrazine, sulfaguanidine, and sulfisomedine persisted. Sulfamethoxazole was reduced up to 80  % at 7  °C as well as at room temperature. The same degradation rate was reached more quickly with higher temperatures than with cooler conditions of storage. Enrofloxacin and tiamulin were reduced to 20  % at 7  °C storage temperature. For tiamulin, a reduction of 10  % at 7  °C and 25  % at room temperature was observed. Only sulfapyridazine and enrofloxacin showed a small decline at a storage temperature of − 20  °C.|$|E
40|$|A rapid, {{simple and}} {{sensitive}} spectrophotometric method for the detn. of some sulfa drugs is described. The method {{is based on}} the formation of orange yellow colored azo product by the diazotization of sulfonamides, viz., dapsone (DAP), sulfathiazole (SFT), sulfadiazine (SFD), sulfacetamide (SFA), sulfamethoxazole (SFMx), <b>sulfamerazine</b> (SFMr), sulfaguanidine (SFG) and sulfadimidine (SFDd) followed by a coupling reaction with 3 -aminophenol in aq. medium. Absorbance of the resulting orange yellow product is measured at 460 nm and is stable for 6 days at 27 Â°C. Beer's law is obeyed in the concn. range of 0. 05 - 8. 0 Î¼g/mL at the wavelength of max. absorption. The method is successfully employed for the detn. of sulfonamides in various pharmaceutical prepns. and common excipients used as additives in pharmaceuticals do not interfere in the proposed method. Plausible reaction mechanism is proposed for the formation of the azo product. [on SciFinder(R) ...|$|E
40|$|New {{spectrophotometric}} method for the detn. of sulfonamides in pure and dosage forms (sulfa drugs) is described. The method {{is based on}} the diazotization of sulfonamides like Sulfadiazine, Sulfacetamide, Sulfamethoxazole, Sulfamethazine, Sulfathiazole, <b>Sulfamerazine,</b> and Sulfaguanidine in acidic medium and subsequent coupling with 4 -amino- 5 -hydroxynaphthalene- 2 - 7 -disulfonic acid (monosodium salt) (ANSA) in alk. medium. Absorbance of the resulting azo dye is measured at 530 nm. Beer's law is obeyed in the concn. range 0. 05 - 7. 0 Î¼g/mL. Molar absorptivities and Sandell's sensitivities are found to be in the range 2. 370 Ã— 104 - 3. 5532 Ã— 104 l/mol/cm and 0. 0075 - 0. 0097 Î¼g/mL resp. Results obtained from the anal. of pure and dosage forms of sulfonamides by this method agree well with those of the official method. The commonly encountered additives and excipients do not interfere with the detns. The method is rapid, facile, selective, and highly sensitive. [on SciFinder(R) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop new films based on chitosan functionalized with sulfonamide drugs (sulfametoxydiazine, sulfadiazine, sulfadimetho-xine, sulfamethoxazol, <b>sulfamerazine,</b> sulfizoxazol) in order to enhance the biological effects of chitosan. The morphology and physical properties of functionalized chitosan films as well the antioxidant effects of sulfonamide-chitosan derivatives were investigated. The chitosan-derivative films showed a rough surface and hydrophilic properties, which are very important features for their use as a wound dressing. The film based on chitosan-sulfisoxazol (CS-S 6) showed the highest swelling ratio (197 %) and the highest biodegradation rate (63. 04 %) in comparison to chitosan film for which the swelling ratio was 190 % and biodegradation rate was only 10 %. Referring to the antioxidant effects the most active was chitosan-sulfamerazine (CS-S 5) which was 8. 3 times more active than chitosan related to DPPH (1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging ability. This compound showed also a good ferric reducing power and improved total antioxidant capacity...|$|E
40|$|Two {{microbiological}} kits {{based on}} Bacillus stearothermophilus (Eclipse 50 ® and Premi®Test) {{have been evaluated}} and validated according to the European guideline for the validation of screening methods (January 2010) and {{in relation to the}} concentrations recommended by the EU-RL in 2007. Both tests are robust, a fast method and easy to implement. Both tests are applicable to a very large variety of honeys from different floral and geographical origins (rosemary, lavender, scrub, heath, alder, forest, lemon, acacia, chestnut, raspberry, mountain and flowers) as well as honey of different colours (from blank honey to brown honey, including yellow and orange honey). A satisfactory false-positive rate of 5 % was obtained for the Eclipse 50 ® test. The observed detection capabilities CCβ of the Eclipse 50 ® kit were: chlortetracycline (> 75 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), oxytetracycline (≤ 200 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), tetracycline (> 100 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), cloxacillin (≤ 40 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), tylosin (≤ 200 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), desmycosin (> 400 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), sulfadiazine (≤ 300 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), sulfadimethoxine (≤ 250 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), <b>sulfamerazine</b> (> 300 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), sulfamethazine (> 1000 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), sulfamethizole (> 75 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), sulfamethoxazole (≤ 25 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), sulfanilamide (≫ 1000 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), sulfaquinoxaline (> 75 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), sulfathiazole (≤ 250 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)) and lincomycin (> 1500 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)). These levels were all higher than the recommended concentrations where they exist. Due to its lack of sensitivity, it cannot be recommended for reliable routine use. The observed CCβ of the Premi®Test kit were: chlortetracycline (10 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), oxytetracycline (> 10 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), tetracycline (≤ 10 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), cloxacillin (≤ 5 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), tylosin (≤ 10 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), desmycosin (≤ 15 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), sulfadiazine (≤ 25 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), sulfadimethoxine (≤ 25 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), <b>sulfamerazine</b> (≤ 25 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), sulfamethazine (≤ 25 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), sulfamethizole (≤ 25 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), sulfamethoxazole (≤ 10 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), sulfanilamide (≤ 25 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), sulfaquinoxaline (≤ 10 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)), sulfathiazole (25 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)) and lincomycin (≤ 25 [*]µg[*]kg(- 1)).
