5000|$|The zig-zag in-line package or ZIP was a {{short-lived}} packaging technology for integrated circuits, particularly dynamic RAM chips. It {{was intended as}} a replacement for dual in-line packaging (DIL or DIP). A ZIP is an integrated circuit encapsulated in a slab of plastic with 20 or 40 pins, measuring (for the ZIP-20 package) about 3 mm x 30 mm x 10 mm. The package's pins protrude in two rows from one of the long edges. The two rows are staggered by 1.27 mm (0.05"), giving them a zig-zag appearance, and allowing them to be spaced more closely than a rectangular grid would allow. The pins are inserted into holes in a printed circuit board, with the packages standing at right-angles to the board, allowing them to be placed closer together than DIPs of the same size. ZIPs have now been superseded by surface-mount packages such as the thin small-outline packages (TSOPs) used on <b>single-in-line</b> <b>memory</b> <b>modules</b> (<b>SIMMs)</b> and dual-in-line <b>memory</b> <b>modules</b> (DIMMs).|$|R

In response, Taiwanese immigrant John Tu designed a new single in-line <b>memory</b> <b>module</b> (<b>SIMM)</b> that used readily available, older-technology through-hole components. In 1990 following year the company branched out into its first non-memory product line, processor upgrades. By 1992, the firm was ranked #1 by Inc. as the fastest-growing privately held company in America. The company expanded into networking and storage product lines, and introduced DataTraveler and DataPak portable products. In September 1994, Kingston became ISO 9000 certified on its first assessment attempt.|$|R

Of the 800 DUTs, 116 failed. In total 72 different test algorithms have been applied, using up to 168 different stress combinations for each test. The results show that GAL 9 R is the best test. Furthermore, it is shown that burst mode tests detect a completely new class of faults over traditional word mode tests. Tests with and without using address scrambling are compared and it is shown, that tests with address scrambling enabled detect more faults. Results indicate that the used set of tests is not adequate as only 39 instead of all 50 modules failed. Content...|$|R

50|$|The Model 200 Series has 15 SIMM slots {{located on}} the system module that can hold 8 to 480 MB of memory. Proprietary 128-pin <b>memory</b> array <b>modules</b> (<b>SIMMs)</b> with {{capacities}} of 8 MB (39 1 Mbit DRAM chips) or 32 MB (39 4 Mbit DRAM chips) are used. All SIMMs installed in a system must be of the same size. If 8 MB SIMMs are used, the system may contain 8 to 120 MB of memory. If 32 MB SIMMs are used, the system may contain 32 to 480 MB of memory. The memory subsystem operates at 25 MHz and is 32 bits wide to match the native word length of the R3000. The memory subsystem is protected by an ECC scheme with seven bits of check for every 32-bit transaction.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that near-data processing (NDP) is an effective technique for improving performance and energy efficiency of data-intensive workloads. However, leveraging NDP in realistic systems with multiple <b>memory</b> <b>modules</b> introduces a new challenge. In today's systems, where no computation occurs in <b>memory</b> <b>modules,</b> the physical address space is interleaved at a fine granularity among all <b>memory</b> <b>modules</b> to help improve the utilization of processor-memory interfaces by distributing the memory traffic. However, this is at odds with efficient use of NDP, which requires careful placement of data in <b>memory</b> <b>modules</b> such that near-data computations and their exclusively used data can be localized in individual <b>memory</b> <b>modules,</b> while distributing shared data among <b>memory</b> <b>modules</b> to reduce hotspots. In order to address this new challenge, we propose a set of techniques that (1) enable collections of OS pages to either be fine-grain interleaved among <b>memory</b> <b>modules</b> (as is done today) or to be placed contiguously on individual <b>memory</b> <b>modules</b> (as is desirable for NDP private data), and (2) decide whether to localize or distribute each memory object based on its anticipated access pattern and steer computations to the memory where the data they access is located. Our evaluations across a wide range of workloads show that the proposed mechanism improves performance by 31 % and reduces 38 % remote data accesses over a baseline system that cannot exploit computate-data affinity characteristics.

The two main classes of such architectures, namely, the Shared Multibuffer-(SMB-) based switch and the Sliding-Window-(SW-) based packet switch, both deploy parallel <b>memory</b> <b>modules</b> that are physically separate but logically connected. Inspite of their similarity in regards to using shareable parallel <b>memory</b> <b>modules,</b> they differ in switching control and scheduling of packets to parallel <b>memory</b> <b>modules.</b> SMB switch uses centralized control whereas the SW switch uses a decentralized control for switching operations. In this paper, we present a new memory assignment scheme for the Sliding-Window (SW) switch for assigning packets to parallel <b>memory</b> <b>modules</b> that maximizes the parallel storage of packets to multiple <b>memory</b> <b>modules.</b> We compare the performance of a sliding-window switch deploying this new memory assignment scheme with that of an SMB switch architecture under conditions of identical traffic type and memory resources deployed.
