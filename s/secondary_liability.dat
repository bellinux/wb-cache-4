The article concludes that taking the subjective mens rea requirements for <b>secondary</b> party <b>liability</b> seriously requires taking Hong Kong's current strong agreement/ intention/knowledge requirements with respect to target offences seriously and guarding against dilution of actual foresight of possible collateral offences requirements by excessive abstraction of foreseen and committed acts.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{motivated}} by a legal challenge {{in the area of}} Chinese copyright protection: Baidu, which was considered a disaster by the copyright owners in China. To solve this legal challenge, the Chinese could learn from the legal experience of Japan and the U. S. regarding this issue. The traditional ISP legal system provides a passive-reactive approach to the <b>secondary</b> copyright <b>liability</b> of ISPs. However, the Baidu issue in China indicates that a passive-reactive ISP model is not able to prevent copyright infringement. Recent cases in China and the U. S. reflect a new trend that the judicial branch adopts an active-preventive approach to ISP issues. This thesis organizes the various legal theories, statutes and cases that may be relevant in an ISP dispute into a framework that may be used to more clearly and effectively evaluate the legal issues of ISPs, with a focus on the proposal for Chinese copyright legal reform. This thesis consists of two parts. The first part examines ISP-related law and cases in the U. S., China and Japan. The second part comparatively analyzes the Baidu issue and suggests possible solutions for Chinese legislature...|$|R

40|$|The Casual Connection as an Element of the Legal Liability Abstract of Dissertation The {{concept of}} the casual {{connection}} is not understood in a uniform manner, although it represents the principal legal institute that enables functioning of the law. However, the nature and purpose of the legal liability in the Czech jurisprudence remains the object of discussions, and this {{is supported by the}} fact that the positive legal regulation uses the concept of liability at random. Within the vindicative {{concept of the}} legal <b>liability</b> as the <b>secondary</b> legal <b>liability</b> arising as the result of the violation of the primary legal liability, we can discern several basic elements. It is particularly the violation of the legal liability, the negative consequence consisting in the violation of or a threat to the legal values, as well as the casual connection between the wrongful act and the negative consequence. The causal connection is the principal element of the legal liability which represents the objective element whereby a wrongful act may be attributed to a certain subject. Thus, the causal connection transmits the penal liability to the subject concerned. Mostly, it is not difficult to find the element of violation of the legal liability and the negative consequence. However, the situation is more complicated in the [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} select the most {{appropriate}} mixed waste treatment technology, many factors need to be evaluated. Depending upon individual circumstances, different factors will carry greater weight. Some of these factors must be addressed {{early on in the}} selection process. Various factors may also be used as screening criteria thus streamlining the selection process. New and innovative technologies should also be addressing key, critical factors during the conceptual development phase in order to guide efforts through the construction of production units. This will aid in the development of technologies which are attractive for technology transfer. This paper discusses considerations relating to the selection of mixed waste treatment technologies. Covered by this paper are applicability, cost, availability/maturity, capacity, safety/reliability, <b>secondary</b> waste generation, <b>liability,</b> regulatory considerations, treatment requirements, and public interactions. Basing selection processes on these factors will help assure that all technologies are evaluated fairly and that the appropriate waste treatment technology is selected for a given situation. Suggestions for selection processes are also covered as well as other important information required for selecting a mixed waste treatment technology...|$|R
40|$|This diploma thesis {{focuses on}} the topic of "Liability for damage caused by {{incorrect}} administrative procedure" under Act No. 82 / 1998 Coll., on liability for damage caused within the exercise of public authority by a decision or incorrect administrative procedure and on the amendment to Act No. 358 / 1992 Coll., on notaries and their activities (Notary Act), as amended. Formally, the thesis is divided into seven chapters, which are further split into individual subchapters. The first chapter deals with the historical development of legislation governing state liability within the exercise of public authority and with current sources of law, including the introduction of literature. The second chapter {{focuses on the}} characterization of the liability as a part of private law and on the basic definition of the term "incorrect administration procedure". This term is generally defined as any procedure of a public authority excluding decision-making activities, which is in conflict with generally applicable legal regulations. The third and fourth chapters respond to the adoption of Act No. 89 / 2012 Coll., Civil Code, and analyse individual impacts of its <b>secondary</b> application to <b>liability</b> obligations.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the copy diminishes the {{individual}} value of the creation and discourages the effort of the creator. Because of this, the responsibility of internet service providers (ISP) concerning copyright infringement by their users has been a subject of great controversy for more than a decade. This discussion has led to a consensus {{in the sense that the}} ISP will not be responsible when their participation in the infringement is limited to transmitting, linking, caching, and disseminating information generated by third parties, as long as other requirements are met, such as adopting and communicating policies intended to prevent infringements. However, the development of new business models and the expansion of services available online have raised the question of whether it is possible to extend the <b>secondary</b> or indirect <b>liability</b> regime to other intermediaries such as internet advertising services and financial transaction providers. In order to analyze the liability regimes that could be applied to these intermediaries,Â¡ it is important to take into account the following points, which will be developed in this paper: i) to understand the operation of online advertising and payments and the economic magnitude of these businesses, ii) to understand the liability regime presently applied to the isp, iii) to study the objections that have been raised against the extension of such regime to online advertising and financial transaction providers, and finally, iv) to analyze how through recent legislative initiatives such as the proposed PIPA, SOPA, and open bills in the United States, efforts have been undertaken to overcome the objections and to offer effective and expeditious mechanisms to protect copyright in the internet...|$|R

50|$|The {{question}} of whether Internet service providers (ISPs) should {{be held liable for}} the actions of network users is unresolved. As to copyright, however, ISPs remain liable, in all territories, as primary, direct infringers of copyright for the copies they make on behalf of their customers, so the issue of additional <b>secondary</b> <b>liability</b> is less significant. An ISP's direct liability arises from the ISP's own actions, not the actions of another party. The confusion arises from the fact that two parties are directly liable in the usual case of internet infringement: the ISP and the ISP's customer. In legal terms, they are joint tortfeasors. This is because they both independently commit all of the acts necessary to establish liability under the copyright laws of most jurisdictions. In situations truly involving <b>secondary</b> <b>liability,</b> the party whose <b>secondary</b> <b>liability</b> is claimed has at least not committed one element required for an infringement action. This situation is not present in the usual ISP situation, as the ISP is always in the position of making copies (without authorization of the rights owner), so it is irrelevant that someone else has infringed the same copyright earlier in time. The ISP's liability is direct, not derivative. It is based on the ISP's own actions, not on someone else's.|$|E
