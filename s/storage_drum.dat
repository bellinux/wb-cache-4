40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{is concerned with}} the feasibility to employ remote sensing for the characterization of the contents of liquid chemical waste <b>storage</b> <b>drums.</b> Philipson et al. (1981) had found that, when the air temperature is changing rapidly, differences in the thermal inertia of the drum contents can lead to detectable differences in the skin temperature of the drums. Thus, postsunset, airborne thermal remote sensing could potentially provide some level of discrimination among chemical <b>storage</b> <b>drums.</b> Discrimination should be possible among steel drums filled largely with: (1) aqueous solvents, (2) organic solvents, or (3) clay packing materials. The response of a drum filled with clay packing materials should be similar to that of an empty drum. The reported study had the objective to verify the theoretical findings, taking into account the use of a hand-held infrared radiometer. It was found that under the proper conditions the temperature differences among drums with the three different types of contents will be significant and consistent...|$|R
50|$|Some drum carders have a soft-bristled brush {{attachment}} that {{presses the}} fibre into the <b>storage</b> <b>drum.</b> This attachment serves to condense the fibres {{already in the}} card cloth and adds {{a small amount of}} additional straightening to the condensed fibre.|$|E

50|$|A {{vacuum truck}} {{exploded}} at the Santa Clara Waste Water {{plant in the}} early morning hours of November 18, 2014. Two workers were injured in the initial explosion, three responding fire-fighters were injured by the fumes from the spill of a highly volatile chemical mixture, and 50 others were exposed to fumes and required treatment at local hospitals. The driver was transporting waste from a temporary <b>storage</b> <b>drum</b> to a processing center when he stopped to take a meal break. The rear of the truck exploded, spreading a white liquid over a 300 by 400 ft that spontaneously combusted as it dried and was sensitive to shock, pressure and the application of water or oxygen. The tires of the first fire truck on the scene and the boots of three firefighters sparked small explosions when they drove and walked over the substance as they went to help the injured workers. The incident evolved into a disaster when later in the morning additional materials began to burn and explode, which resulted in a 3 mi and the closing of Highway 126. Chemical smoke drifted over the area and nearby residents and businesses were required to evacuate.|$|E

5000|$|The Solid State {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{computers}} to use some solid-state components. However, much of the computer's logic was made out of magnetic amplifiers, not transistors. The decision to use magnetic amplifiers was made because the point-contact germanium transistors then available had highly variable characteristics and were not sufficiently reliable. The magnetic amplifiers were based on tiny (about 1/8" [...] ID) toroidal stainless steel spools wound with two or so layers of 1/32" [...] wide 4-79 moly-permalloy magnetic material to form magnetic cores. These cores had two windings of #60 copper wire surrounding the 4-79 molypermalloy. [...] The magnetic amplifiers required clock pulses of heavy current that could not be produced by the transistors of the day. The system used a clock derived from a timing band recorded on the main <b>storage</b> <b>drum.</b> This signal was read and amplified, processed and sent to the driver tubes, a pair of 6146 power pentode output tubes. The output from these tubes then fed the main clock power amplifier consisting of six 4CX250B metal/ceramic power tetrode tubes running in push-pull/parallel, yielding an output of a kilowatt. The powerful high-voltage signal was stepped down to a 36-volt, high-current clock by oil-filled transformers that were distributed about the machine. The SS80/90 computer could be heard quite clearly in the AM broadcast band at 707 kHz and 1414 kHz. The 4CX250B tetrodes used a grounded plate (anode) due to forced aircooling requirements. This tube is still in demand by amateur radio operators. The clock tube was enclosed in a shielding box that constrained both radio emissions and viewing by eyes of other than Univac's field engineers. The power supply output was -1.6 kV for cathode supply and -800 V screen grid supply at 1.8 A capacity. The supply weighed nearly 100 pounds and was mounted at the very top of the power supply stack. Thus the SS 80/90, for the heart of its operation, depended on the very technology it claimed to replace, a marketing tactic.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{approach}} to the autonomous generation of trajectories for multiple aerial vehicles is presented, whereby an artificial kinematic field provides autonomous control in a distributed and highly scalable manner. The kinematic field is generated relative to a central target and is modified when a vehicle is in close proximity of another to avoid collisions. This control scheme is then applied to the mock visual inspection of a nuclear intermediate level waste <b>storage</b> <b>drum.</b> The inspection is completed using two commercially available quadcopters, in a laboratory environment, with the acquired visual inspection data processed and photogrammetrically meshed to generate a three-dimensional surface-meshed model of the drum.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} a method whereby {{the distribution of}} fatigue damage along riser tensioner ropes is calculated, taking account of heave motion, set tension, system geometry, tidal range and rope specification. From these data the distribution of damage along the rope is calculated for a given time period using a Miner’s summation method. This information can then {{be used to help}} the operator decide on the length of rope to ‘slip and cut’ whereby a length {{from the end of the}} rope is removed and the rope moved through the system from a <b>storage</b> <b>drum</b> such that sections of rope that have already suffered significant fatigue damage are not moved to positions where there is another peak in the distribution. There are two main advantages to be gained by using the fatigue damage model. The first is that it shows the amount of fatigue damage accumulating at different points along the rope, enabling the most highly damaged section to be removed well before failure. The second is that it makes for greater efficiency, as damage can be spread more evenly along the rope over time, avoiding the need to scrap long sections of undamaged rope...|$|E

40|$|Using an {{artificial}} kinematic field to provide co-ordination between multiple inspection UAVs, the authors herein demonstrate full 3 D modelling capability {{based on a}} photogrammetric system. The operation {{of the system is}} demonstrated by generating a full 3 D surface model of an intermediate level nuclear waste <b>storage</b> <b>drum.</b> Such drums require periodic inspection to ensure that drum distortion or corrosion is carefully monitored. Inspection is performed by multiple airborne platforms, which would enable rapid inspection of structures that are inaccessible to on-surface remote vehicles and are in human-hazardous environments. A three-dimensional surface-meshed model of the target is then constructed in post-processing through photogrammetry analysis of the visual inspection data. The inspection environment uses a tracking system to precisely monitor the position of each aerial vehicle within the enclosure. The vehicles used are commercially available Parrot AR. Drone quadcopters, controlled through a computer interface connected over an IEEE 802. 11 n (WiFi) network, implementing a distributed controller for each vehicle. This enables the autonomous and distributed elements of the control scheme to be retained, while alleviating the vehicles of the control algorithm’s computational load. The control scheme relies on a kinematic field defined with the target at its centre. This field defines the trajectory for all the drones in the volume relative to the central target, enabling the drones to circle the target at a set radius while avoiding drone collisions. This function enables complete coverage along the height of the object, which is assured by transitioning to another inspection band only after completing circumferential coverage. Using a swarm of vehicles, the time until complete coverage can be significantly reduced...|$|E
40|$|Umbilical is a {{hardware}} element {{that connects the}} subsea systems to the top side systems of a floating production unit. During its manufacture, storage and installation, sometimes it shows behaviour like snake as found {{in three of the}} Aker Solution s umbilical Agbami, Droshky and kipper in three different situations. An umbilical passes through many operations in the manufacturing plant like bundling, extrusion, reeling on and off the <b>storage</b> <b>drum,</b> transfer into installation vessel from storage reel. Different types of loading phenomenon may appear in these stages of operation. And from these loads even before being in the operation field, umbilical can experience different type of deformation in the manufacturing plant. Curvature is the main source of umbilical deformation in the manufacturing field. Curvature may introduce directly in the umbilical from operation loads of straightener, creeping or squeezing effect in tensioner. Curvature may also arise from internal friction and unbalanced bending moment which arises from design i. e. orientation, geometry and material property of the internal structural components. To find the solutions of avoiding different deformations at the different stages of the manufacturing plant and to ensure desire comfortable handling, it is necessary to predict their behaviours correctly at different loading conditions. Exact analytical and numerical modelling is needed to find and predict the exact behaviours. In this thesis work, number of modelling and simulations have been done in software USAP and BFLEX to investigate the reason of snaking behaviour of three umbilicals, occurred in the manufacturing plant of Aker Solutions. From the results of simulations it has found that umbilical Agbami experienced snaking when it was transferring from storage reel for installation work, due to having residual curvature from storage reel, gravity load and twisting rotation. The reason of residual curvature is creeping of its outersheath. Umbilical Droshky showed snaking deformation because of having residual curvature in its component steel tubes. And, in umbilical Kipper snaking deformation arose because of developing internal friction in it. In the different modelling of this work, PIPE 31 element is used for the modelling of umbilical core pipe or outersheath and to model the inside helix elements HELIX 231 element is used in USAP and HSHEAR 353 element in BFLEX. The contact between pipe and helix element in BFLEX is modelled by HCONT 453 element. The software USAP and BFLEX has showed convergence problem in some cases of modelling. Improvement is needed to overcome these problems...|$|E
