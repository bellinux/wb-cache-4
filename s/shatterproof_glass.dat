While filming The Birds, he makes physical advances {{to her in}} the back of a limousine but she rebuffs him and escapes through the back door. In retaliation for her rejection, Hitchcock exposes Hedren to terrifying encounters with birds. A mechanical bird breaks the apparently <b>shatterproof</b> <b>glass</b> of a telephone booth during filming, scratching Hedren's face with splintering glass. After arriving on set to shoot a scene where Hedren's character (Melanie Daniels) is trapped in an attic with aggressive birds, she discovers that Hitchcock has ordered the mechanical birds to be replaced with live ones. He demands the scene be repeated until he is satisfied that Hedren's reaction looks authentic. This takes a protracted several days of filming, leaving Hedren traumatised.|$|E

Six are [...] high while two on the east face are [...] high for easier egress. All were originally provided with thin marble shutters in a bronze frame each {{of which could be}} opened inward, one left and the other right per wall. After two people committed suicide by jumping through the open windows in the 1920s, hinged horizontal iron bars were added to them in 1929. A ninth opening in a slab on the south face just below the capstone is provided for access to the outside of the pyramidion. It is covered by a stone slab which is internally removable. In 1931, four red aircraft warning lights were installed, one per face in one of its observation windows. Pilots complained that they could not be easily seen, so the monument was floodlit on all sides as well. In 1958, eight [...] diameter holes for new red aircraft warning lights were bored, one above each window near the top edge of the fourth course of slabs (516-foot level) in the pyramidion. In 1958 the observation windows were glazed with <b>shatterproof</b> <b>glass.</b> In 1974–76, they were glazed with bulletproof glass and the shutters removed. New bulletproof glass was installed during 1997–2000.|$|E
25|$|White fuming {{nitric acid}}, pure nitric acid or WFNA, {{is very close}} to {{anhydrous}} nitric acid. It is available as 99.9% nitric acid by assay. One specification for white fuming nitric acid is that it has a maximum of 2% water and a maximum of 0.5% dissolved NO2. Anhydrous nitric acid has a density of 1.513g/cm3 and has the approximate concentration of 24 molar. Anhydrous nitric acid is a colorless mobile liquid with a density of 1.512g/cm3, which solidifies at −42°C to form white crystals. As it decomposes to NO2 and water, it obtains a yellow tint. It boils at 83°C. It is usually stored in a <b>glass</b> <b>shatterproof</b> amber bottle with twice the volume of head space to allow for pressure build up, but even with those precautions the bottle must be vented monthly to release pressure.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} provide greater meaning and {{significance}} to wire glass {{so that it}} may be preserved by exploring the historical origins and complexity of manufacture of the medium. The Industrial Revolution was a period of amazing evolution in the history of glass manufacture. Plate glass technology allowed for new design and building construction concepts, including the Crystal Palace, but this was an imperfect technology. As the brilliant minds of the Revolution struggled to grapple with the obstacles posed by plate glass, wire glass was eventually born. This new glass type spread across the United States in subsequent years, fueled by uniform manufacture standards on the city and state levels and the American mass media’s coverage of conflagrations, which led to the public’s association of wire glass with safety given its fire retardant and <b>shatterproof</b> qualities. Wire <b>glass</b> was technically incredibly difficult to produce, especially in mass production, and although inventors experimented with various treatments and patterns, wire glass remained and was comparatively expensive (though people generally believed the safety benefits outweighed the costs). Wire glass fell into disfavor during the World Wars as it was replaced by newer types of glass that were more economical, but recent trends have sparked renewed interest in the use and hence preservation of wire glass. Original methods of wire glass manufacture using early wire netting patterns no longer exist, and so current methods of preservation and conservation involving replication through glass lamination methods using imported wire nettings and salvage are discussed. Possible conservation treatments for repair are debated and further research is concluded...|$|R

40|$|Luminescent solar {{concentrators}} are devices {{capable of}} converting some spectral components of solar radiation by luminescence and concentrating them before collection by photovoltaic. The {{aim of this}} thesis is to design, develop and demonstrate the principle of all-inorganic semitransparent luminescent solar concentrator (LSC) structures capable of passing most of the visible light through to provide illumination, while reflecting more than 90 % of the UV and IR radiations and scattering them {{to the edges of}} the glass where they are collected by PV cells to produce electricity. All-inorganic visibly-transparent energy-harvesting clear laminated glass windows are the most practical solution to boosting building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) energy outputs significantly while reducing cooling- and heatingrelated energy consumption in buildings. A typical semitransparent luminescent solar concentrator is based on the integration of micro-engineered optical structures, nano-materials and IR-selective thin-film coatings, to realise stable, long-lifetime and <b>shatterproof</b> clear <b>glass</b> panels. The ability of the proposed semitransparent luminescent solar concentrators to generate electricity addresses the future net-zero-energy building demand [1, 2], making them ideal candidates for future high-rise glass buildings. The developed semitransparent luminescent solar concentrators employ low-e thin films, which particularly, provide many benefits, including, (i) building overall aesthetic appearance, (ii) low glare and (iii) filtration of unwanted components of the incident sunlight thus increasing the energy saving rating of buildings. The low-e glass panes are typically used in a double glazing structure {{in order to protect the}} low-e film from environmental impacts and improve the insulation properties of the semitransparent luminescent solar concentrators in addition to reducing the energy consumed for cooling or heating the inside of buildings. Multi-layer thin film coatings for solar and thermal radiation control are designed, using the Optilayer software package, developed using Physical Vapour Deposition (PVD), and tested using spectrophotometry. Experimental results show that the measured transmittance spectra for the developed structures are in agreement with simulation results and demonstrate that with the use of optimum metal-dielectric layer combination it is possible to transmit/reflect arbitrary spectral components of the incident sunlight. In addition, two types of semitransparent luminescent solar concentrator structures are designed, developed and characterised, namely: 1. LSCs incorporating inorganic luminophore materials into the lamination interlayer. These luminophores, when used in conjunction with spectrally-selective low-e thin-film coatings and CuInSe 2 solar cells, enable most of the visible solar radiation to be transmitted through the glass window with minimum attenuation and the ultraviolet (UV) radiation to be down-converted and routed together with a significant part of infrared radiation to the edges for collection by solar cells. 2. Advanced LSCs incorporating inorganic luminophore materials as well as spectrallyselective diffraction gratings as light deflector structures of high visible transparency into the lamination interlayer. For these LSCs, most of the visible solar radiation can be transmitted through the glass windows with minimum attenuation while the ultraviolet (UV) and a part of incident solar infrared (IR) radiation energy are converted and/or deflected geometrically for routing towards the vicinity of glass panel edge regions for collection by solar cells. To boost the solar concentration capability of the laminated glass panes, functionalized epoxy interlayers are especially developed, which comprise UV-curable epoxy and inorganic luminophores with engineered absorption and emission bands. The developed functionalized interlayers demonstrate an excellent ability to scatter and concentrate sunlight within the glass structure with minimum reabsorption. Several materials and combinations of several luminophore types were investigated in order to determine the optimum interlayer structure that exhibits maximum UV and IR radiation scattering, conversion, and deflection towards the edge solar cells. Measured conversion efficiencies of 3. 8 % and 5. 4 % are achieved for 10 cm × 10 cm LSCs samples without and with diffraction gratings, which correspond to output electrical power densities of 38 Wp/m 2 and 54 Wp/m 2,respectively. A photobioreactor based on the developed semitransparent luminescent solar concentrator technology is developed, in collaboration with Murdoch University, for microalgae growth. An Insulated Glass Units (IGU) employing a special low-e thin film is developed, which passes more than 50 % of the visible light while blocking more than 90 % of the UV and IR radiations, hence, reducing the temperature inside the photobioreactor and improving the microalgae growth.

5000|$|Contreras {{explains}} that American Securit Co. v. <b>Shatterproof</b> <b>Glass</b> Corp. is a notable case {{because it is}} the first decision to address the consequences of a patent holder’s violation of the terms of a court-imposed compulsory patent licensing decree. In 1948, a district court entered a consent decree establishing that Securit and other glass-manufacturer defendants violated the Sherman Act by conspiring to exploit patents covering technology for tempering flat glass panes in a restrictive manner. The defendants were ordered to grant to any applicant a non-exclusive license under their patents and to refrain from including any restrictions or conditions in that license. The consent decree included a prohibition against requiring a licensee to take a license under any patent not covered by the decree. <b>Shatterproof</b> <b>Glass</b> requested a license from Securit in 1951 for a license under some patents covered in the consent decree. Securit refused to grant Shatterproof a license unless it agreed to license a larger portfolio of patents that included patents not covered in the decree, at a single, fixed royalty rate—a so-called package license. After inconclusive negotiations, Shatterproof began to manufacture glass in a manner allegedly covered by Securit’s patents. Securit then sued Shatterproof for patent infringement. Shatterproof raised as defenses patent misuse and Securit's violation of the consent order, which expressly prohibited Securit's package-licensing demand. The district court in Delaware ruled for Shatterproof on both grounds and barred Securit from enforcing its patents against Shatterproof, and the Third Circuit affirmed. Securit argued to the district court that the package license was its standard form of license and deviating from that standard offering would discriminate against Securit’s existing licensees. The district court rejected the argument, saying that obey the consent decree. Contreras states that this is [...] "the first example of patents being rendered unenforceable {{as a result of the}} violation of a court-imposed patent licensing commitment." ...|$|E

5000|$|Some {{components}} and {{features of the}} car were innovative and ahead of their time. The most recognizable feature of the Tucker '48, a directional third headlight (known as the [...] "Cyclops Eye"), would activate at steering angles of greater than 10 degrees to light the car's path around corners. At the time, 17 states had laws against cars having more than two headlights. Tucker fabricated a cover for the cyclops center light for use in these states.The car had a rear engine and rear-wheel drive. A perimeter frame surrounded the vehicle for crash protection, {{as well as a}} roll bar integrated into the roof. The steering box was behind the front axle to protect the driver in a front-end accident. The instrument panel and all controls were within easy reach of the steering wheel, and the dashboard was padded for safety. The windshield was made of <b>shatterproof</b> <b>glass</b> and designed to pop out in a collision to protect occupants. The car's parking brake had a separate key so it could be locked in place to prevent theft. The doors extended into the roof, to ease entry and exit. Each Tucker built differed somewhat from the previous car, as each car built was basically a [...] "prototype" [...] where design features and engineering concepts were tried, improved, or discarded throughout the production cycle. The door releases on the interior of the Tucker came from the Lincoln Zephyr. The steering columns used in the Tucker were donated by Ford and are from the 1941 Lincoln. Preston Tucker held a patent for a collapsible steering column design. A glove box was added to the front door panels instead of the more conventional location in the dashboard to provide space for the [...] "crash chamber" [...] that the Tucker is now famous for. This is a padded area ahead of the passenger seat, free from obstructions, providing the front seat passengers an area to protect themselves {{in the event of an}} accident. The engine and transmission were mounted on a separate subframe which was secured with only six bolts. The entire drive train could thus be lowered and removed from the car in minutes. Tucker envisioned loaner engines being quickly swapped in for service in just 30 minutes.|$|E
