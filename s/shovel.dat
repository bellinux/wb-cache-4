5|$|On May16, 1940, Samuel Johnson, the {{vice-chair}} of the NFBC, and McQuesten, who {{along with}} his parliamentary role was chair of the commission, ceremonially turned the first sod for the new bridge using a two-handled <b>shovel.</b>|$|E
5|$|The film {{comes to}} an end with Rambabu signing a {{register}} at the newly constructed Rajavaram police station. As he leaves, a flashback shows him during the construction of the station with a <b>shovel</b> in hand, indicating that Varun's body is hidden in the building's foundation.|$|E
5|$|Even {{in areas}} where {{mortality}} was low, so many were incapacitated that much of everyday life was hampered. Some communities closed all stores or required customers to leave orders outside. There were reports that the health-care workers could not tend the sick nor the gravediggers bury the dead because they too were ill. Mass graves were dug by steam <b>shovel</b> and bodies buried without coffins in many places.|$|E
50|$|Steam <b>shovels</b> {{assisted}} mining operations: {{the iron}} mines of Minnesota, the copper mines of Chile and Montana, placer mines of the Klondike - all had earth-moving equipment. But {{it was with}} the burgeoning open-pit mines - first in Bingham Canyon, Utah - that <b>shovels</b> came into their own. The <b>shovels</b> systematically removed hillsides. As a result, steam <b>shovels</b> were used around the world from Australia to Russia to coal mines in China. <b>Shovels</b> were also used for construction, road and quarry work.|$|R
40|$|<b>Shovelling</b> of the incisors is {{considered}} to be a polygenic inheritable trait. <b>Shovelling</b> differs considerably between groups of racial populations but is relatively stable within each group. Presence or absence of <b>shovelling</b> helps in racial identification and in exploration of ancestry. Periapical radiographs of patients of several nationalities from Asian and African continents were obtained. <b>Shovelling</b> and invaginations associated with the shovel-shaped incisors was studied according to nationality. Results indicated that the incidence of <b>shovelling</b> in Syrians, Jordanians, Palestinians and Filipinos was 5 – 6 per cent. In Saudi Arabians, Pakistanis and Indians, the incidence of <b>shovelling</b> was 10 – 12 per cent. Among Yemenis, Sudanese and Egyptians, the incidence of <b>shovelling</b> was 20 – 25 percent. The occurrence of invaginations in shovel-shaped incisors was 11 per cent. King Saud Universit...|$|R

5|$|Falkenberg and Næsheim {{held onto}} Bågenholm's skis {{as they waited}} for the rescue teams to arrive. At first Bågenholm {{struggled}} in the cold water before she found an air pocket and was able to remain conscious for 40minutes before becoming a victim of circulatory arrest. Ketil Singstad led the rescue team {{from the top of the}} mountain. He skied as fast as he could to Bågenholm's location, where he and his rescue team tried unsuccessfully to pull her out with a rope. They then tried to dig her out, but their snow <b>shovel</b> could not break through the ice. Rescuers from the bottom of the mountain then arrived, bringing with them a pointed gardening <b>shovel.</b> They were able to cut a hole in the ice, and pulled her through at 19:40. Bågenholm had been in the water for 80minutes when she was rescued.|$|E
5|$|In July 2010, Ilenstine and Larsen plead {{no contest}} to the {{misdemeanor}} violation of county-code. The code states that anyone performing work that could spark a fire must have a <b>shovel</b> or fire extinguisher on hand. The two were each sentenced to 250 hours of community service, three years probation and a $490 fine.|$|E
5|$|Therefore, {{the parish}} was {{in desperate need}} of a new rectory and the new project was begun in 1944. An engineer, Frank H. Recco, was the {{technical}} advisor of the project. Parishioners borrowed a bulldozer from the John F. Casey Company in Aspinwall, and a steam <b>shovel</b> from the Burrell Construction and Supply Company of New Kensington; and they dug the foundation for a two-level building.|$|E
50|$|The Type 22 and Type 28 Marion <b>shovels</b> {{were the}} most popular. They were the fully revolving, wheel or track {{contractors}} shovel.Around 800 were built from 1905 to 1930. Contractors and road builders found them very useful. Marion also built floating dredges from land reclamation projects and the famous Klondike Gold dredges in Dawson City. Trenching <b>shovels,</b> stripping <b>shovels,</b> railroad <b>shovels</b> and draglines were also built. Large <b>shovels</b> were built for the Ohio open pit coalfields. By the late 1930s, steam gave way to diesel engine.|$|R
50|$|During the 1930s steam <b>shovels</b> {{lost out}} to the simpler, cheaper {{diesel-powered}} excavating <b>shovels</b> that were the forerunners of those still in use today. Open-pit mines were electrified at this time. Only after the Second World War, {{with the advent of}} robust high-pressure hydraulic hoses, did the more versatile hydraulic excavators take pre-eminence over the cable-hoisting winch <b>shovels.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the 1930s {{diesel-powered}} excavation <b>shovels</b> replaced steam <b>shovels</b> for {{the excavation}} of railway right-of-ways and the digging of basements and foundations for skyscrapers and domestic housing, {{in the late}} 19th century.|$|R
5|$|Beside the weapons, each zduhać {{carried a}} milk bucket and a peck measure; an {{alternative}} {{for the latter}} could be a <b>shovel</b> or broom from a threshing floor. If a band of zduhaći succeeded to seize the peck measures from the enemy band, they would thereby transfer the crop yield from the area of their enemies to their own area. Seizing the milk buckets meant that the milk yield would be transferred. According to the clan of Kuči, zduhaći used their peck measures, milk buckets, and other containers to grab off the overall yield of the enemy territory.|$|E
5|$|Diefenbaker was {{commissioned}} a lieutenant into the 196th (Western Universities) Battalion, CEF in May 1916. In September, Diefenbaker {{was part of}} a contingent of 300 junior officers sent to Britain for pre-deployment training. Diefenbaker related in his memoirs that he was hit by a <b>shovel,</b> and the injury eventually resulted in his being invalided home. Diefenbaker's recollections do not correspond with his army medical records, which show no contemporary account of such an injury, and his biographer, Denis Smith, speculates that any injury was psychosomatic.|$|E
5|$|During an autopsy, {{the agents}} {{discover}} that the baby suffocated by inhaling dirt—meaning it was buried alive. Scully suggests that the baby's defects could {{have been caused by}} inbreeding. Mulder insists this would be impossible, since the Peacocks seem to live in an all-male household. Suspecting that the Peacocks have kidnapped and raped a woman, Mulder and Scully investigate their now-abandoned residence and discover blood, scissors, and a <b>shovel</b> on a table. Arrest warrants are issued for the three brothers. In retaliation, the Peacocks break into Sheriff Taylor's house during the night and murder him and his wife.|$|E

2500|$|Excavation {{was done}} with <b>shovels</b> until the late 19th century when steam <b>shovels</b> came into use. [...] It was {{reported}} that a laborer on the western division of the Erie Canal was expected to dig 5 cubic yards per day in 1860; however, by 1890 only 3-1/2 yards per day were expected. [...] Today's large electric <b>shovels</b> have buckets that can hold 168 cubic meters and consume {{the power of a}} city of 100,000.|$|R
5|$|Homer and Bart {{begin their}} grease {{business}} and make sixty-three cents worth of grease from twenty-seven dollars' worth of bacon, much to Homer's glee and Bart's disappointment. After Bart {{points out that}} they need larger amounts of grease, the pair drive to Krusty Burger, where they attempt steal grease from the fryers. After loading it into Marge's car, two employees of The Acne Grease and <b>Shovel</b> Company steal it, claiming they control the grease and shoveling business in the city.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to its earlier place amongst the wealthy, during the 17th and 18th centuries, the pasty became popular with working people in Cornwall, where tin miners and others adopted it {{due to its}} unique shape, forming a complete meal that could be carried easily and eaten without cutlery. In a mine, the pasty's dense, folded pastry could stay warm for several hours, and if it did get cold, it could easily be warmed on a <b>shovel</b> over a candle.|$|E
5|$|Later, Geetha and Prabhakar (Siddique) meet Georgekutty to ask {{forgiveness}} for their rude and violent behavior. Prabhakar asks Georgekutty {{if he can}} tell them about their son. Georgekutty then reveals indirectly that his family has committed a crime. Now in remand, Georgekutty signs a register at the newly constructed local police station. As he leaves, a flashback shows him leaving the incomplete police station with a <b>shovel</b> in hand, indicating that he has hidden Varun's body in {{the foundations of the}} police station itself.|$|E

5|$|The Hokies {{returned}} North Carolina's kickoff to the Tech 35-yard line, and the Hokies {{began their}} final {{possession of the}} game. Sorensen completed a four-yard pass, then ran for 19 yards and a first down at the North Carolina 42-yard line. A <b>shovel</b> pass by Sorensen gained three yards, but he lost three yards on the next play and was sacked for a six-yard loss on third down. A fourth-down pass was batted down by the Carolina defense, and the Tar Heels' offense returned to the field with 2:41 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|The Pennsylvania Turnpike {{groundbreaking}} {{was held}} on October 27, 1938, near Carlisle; Commission Chairman Walter A. Jones thrust the first <b>shovel</b> into the earth. Turnpike construction was on a tight schedule, since completion of the road was originally planned by May 1, 1940. After the groundbreaking, contracts for finishing the former South Pennsylvania Railroad tunnels, grading the turnpike's right-of-way, constructing bridges and paving were awarded. By July 1939, {{the entire length of}} the turnpike was under contract.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is divided}} into eight caverns, which must be {{explored}} whilst avoiding death from enemy attacks, cave-ins, and fatal falls. The player-character, Digger T. Rock, can utilise multiple tools such as ladders, shovels, armour, and explosives, {{which can be used}} to explore and discover new areas. Monsters such as moles, mosquitoes, and dragons seek to kill the player-character. Digger's only defence is his <b>shovel,</b> which can be used to attack enemies as well as mining stone. The player starts the game with three lives.|$|E
5000|$|Expanding railway {{networks}} (in the US and the UK) {{fostered a}} demand for steam <b>shovels.</b> The extensive mileage of railways, and corresponding volume of material to be moved, forced the technological leap. As a result, steam <b>shovels</b> became commonplace.|$|R

Stan at first opposes but he, with Cartman and Kenny take shovels and the scene ends with the boys digging Jackson's grave to show he is dead while Ike/Jackson dances. Jackson's grave shows his date of death as July 25, 2009, when in fact he died on June 25.|$|E
5|$|Following the turnover, Clemson {{received}} {{the ball at}} its 28-yard line. Simmons ran the ball straight ahead for an eight-yard gain, gained one yard on a run, then Kelly ran for a first down at the 40-yard line. On first down, Simmons completed an 18-yard pass to Gardner at the Tech 42-yard line. Simmons then completed a six-yard pass before throwing a <b>shovel</b> pass to Kelly for a first down at the Tech 32-yard line. An incomplete pass was followed by six-yard toss and a pass to Watts at the 12-yard line. Simmons ran out of bounds for a two-yard loss, then completed a touchdown pass to Gardner. The extra point kick was good, and Clemson closed Virginia Tech's lead to 3420 with 7:19 remaining.|$|E
5|$|Men were lowered by bucket {{down the}} airshafts to dig by candlelight. They were paid £1.50 per week to <b>shovel</b> 20 tons (20.32 tonnes) {{of rock and}} earth per 12–hour shift, seven days a week. Conditions were {{constantly}} wet, with foul air and gunpowder fumes and the danger of roof–collapse. The tunnel cuts through hard sandstone, shale and clay, and there are seven major faults in the rock near the centre point. The work was dangerous because the rock at the Horsforth end was difficult to blast, and there was frequent flooding and subsidence. About 1,563,480,000 gallons (7,107,580,080 litres) of water were pumped out of the workings between 1845 and 1849. Metal sheets had {{to be used to}} divert water inside the tunnel.|$|E
