25|$|Yeah sure, we <b>see</b> <b>ourselves</b> as a metal band, {{but without}} {{boundaries}} and limitations to our sound. We {{do not necessarily}} belong to a certain subgenre within metal. We're just playing dark and heavy music and keeping an open mind to evolve and being true to ourselves. I'm proud to say that I believe KATATONIA sounds like no other band. We have eloquently avoided the gothic metal genre most bands tend to fall in when changing their sound from doom/death metal to something more rocking and melodic. We're leaning towards more of a contemporary alternative sound, free of all cheese and clichés.|$|E
25|$|In Section II, Kant {{starts from}} scratch and {{attempts}} to move from popular moral philosophy to a metaphysics of morals. Kant begins Section II of the Groundwork by criticizing attempts to begin moral evaluation with empirical observation. He states that even when we take ourselves to be behaving morally, we cannot be at all certain that we are purely motivated by duty and not by inclinations. Kant observes that humans are quite good at deceiving themselves {{when it comes to}} evaluating their motivations for acting, and therefore even in circumstances where individuals believe themselves to be acting from duty, it is possible they are acting merely in accordance with duty and are motivated by some contingent desire. However, the fact that we <b>see</b> <b>ourselves</b> as often falling short of what morality demands of us indicates we have some functional concept of the moral law.|$|E

500|$|In 1989 President George H.W. Bush awarded Kennan the Medal of Freedom, the nation's {{greatest}} civilian honor. Yet {{he remained}} a realist critic of recent U.S. presidents, urging the U.S. government to [...] "withdraw from its public advocacy {{of democracy and}} human rights", saying that the [...] "tendency to <b>see</b> <b>ourselves</b> {{as the center of}} political enlightenment and as teachers to a great part {{of the rest of the}} world strikes me as unthought-through, vainglorious and undesirable". These ideas were particularly applicable to U.S. relations with China and Russia. Kennan opposed the Clinton administration's war in Kosovo and its expansion of NATO (the establishment of which he had also opposed half a century earlier), expressing fears that both policies would worsen relations with Russia. He described NATO enlargement as a [...] "strategic blunder of potentially epic proportions".|$|E
500|$|Charles Darwin {{considered}} that conscience evolved in humans to resolve conflicts between competing natural impulses-some about self-preservation but others about {{safety of a}} family or community; the claim of conscience to moral authority emerged from the [...] "greater duration of impression of social instincts" [...] {{in the struggle for}} survival. In such a view, behavior destructive to a person's society (either to its structures or to the persons it comprises) is bad or [...] "evil". Thus, conscience can be viewed as an outcome of those biological drives that prompt humans to avoid provoking fear or contempt in others; being experienced as guilt and shame in differing ways from society to society and person to person. A requirement of conscience in this view is the capacity to <b>see</b> <b>ourselves</b> {{from the point of view}} of another person. Persons unable to do this (psychopaths, sociopaths, narcissists) therefore often act in ways which are [...] "evil".|$|E

2500|$|Practitioners do {{not believe}} that Satan {{literally}} exists and do not worship him. Instead, Satan is viewed as a positive archetype embracing the Hebrew root of the word [...] "Satan" [...] as [...] "adversary", who represents pride, , and enlightenment, and of a cosmos which Satanists perceive to be motivated by a [...] "dark evolutionary force of entropy that permeates all of nature and provides the drive for survival and propagation inherent in all living things". The Devil is embraced as a symbol of defiance against the Abrahamic faiths which LaVey criticized for what he saw as the suppression of humanity's natural instincts. Moreover, Satan also serves as a metaphorical external projection of the individual's godhood. LaVey espoused the view that [...] "god" [...] is a creation of man, rather than man being a creation of [...] "god". In his book, The Satanic Bible, the Satanist's view of god is described as the Satanist's true [...] "self"—a projection {{of his or her own}} personality—not an external deity. Satan is used as a representation of personal liberty and individualism. LaVey explained that the gods worshiped by other religions are also projections of man's true self. He argues that man's unwillingness to accept his own ego has caused him to externalize these gods so as to avoid the feeling of narcissism that would accompany self-worship. The current High Priest of the Church of Satan, Peter H. Gilmore, further expounds that [...] "...Satan is a symbol of Man living as his prideful, carnal nature dictates [...] Satan is not a conscious entity to be worshiped, rather a reservoir of power inside each human to be tapped at will. The Church of Satan has chosen Satan as its primary symbol because in Hebrew it means adversary, opposer, one to accuse or question. We <b>see</b> <b>ourselves</b> as being these Satans; the adversaries, opposers and accusers of all spiritual belief systems that would try to hamper enjoyment of our life as a human being" [...] The term [...] "Theistic Satanism" [...] has been described as [...] "oxymoronic" [...] by the church and its High Priest. The Church of Satan rejects the legitimacy of any other organizations who claim to be Satanists, dubbing them reverse-Christians, pseudo-Satanists or Devil worshipers, atheistic or otherwise, and maintains a purist approach to Satanism as expounded by LaVey.|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} cinematic {{adaptation of}} the play is D.W. Griffith's eleven-minute The Taming of the Shrew, made for Biograph in 1908, starring Florence Lawrence as Katherina and Arthur V. Johnson as Petruchio. The blurb for the film stated [...] "if we could <b>see</b> <b>ourselves</b> as others see us what models we would become." [...] Also released in Italy in 1908 was the seven-minute La bisbetica domata, directed by Azeglio Pineschi and Lamberto Pineschi. There is no known cast list for this film. Unlike all other silent adaptations, this version retains the Katherina/Bianca sibling rivalry. In 1911, F.R. Benson directed a twelve-minute silent filmed extract from his own Shakespeare Memorial Theatre production, starring himself and his wife, Constance Benson. The film presented a heavily truncated pantomime version of the story, with pieces of Shakespeare's original text used as intertitles throughout. It is now believed lost, although several stills survive in the library archives of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust. Also released in France in 1911 was La mégère apprivoisée, directed by Henri Desfontaines and starring Madeleine Barjac and Romauld Joubé. It {{is thought to be}} the first version to show scenes which take place off-stage in the play; in this case, the wedding and the journey to Petruchio's house. A 1913 Italian version, the twenty-two-minute La bisbetica domata, was directed by Arrigo Frusta and starred Gigetta Morano and Eleuterio Rodolfi. This version also shows scenes not in the play. Another English adaptation was released in 1915, directed by and starring Arthur Backner. This version is also lost. Intended more as a showcase for a new type of sound system than an {{adaptation of the}} play, the film consisted entirely of the scene where Petruchio and Katherina first meet. Shot using a process known as Voxograph, the actors spoke the complete text during filming, and when the film was played at the theatre, [...] "the same actors, one at each side of the screen but unseen, repeated the words in {{what was supposed to be}} synchronisation. It was expected that the operator, after rehearsal, would be able to project the film so that picture and voice would jibe." [...] The earliest surviving British filmic adaptation is Edwin J. Collins' 1923 version, adapted by Eliot Stannard, and starring Dacia Deane and Lauderdale Maitland. One of a series of forty-minute adaptations of classic texts released under the Gems of Literature banner, only the second half of the film survives, and the final scene is incomplete as a result of print damage. This version very much adopts Petruchio's perspective, and one of the intertitles reads [...] "by noon the next day, though famished and weary for want of food and rest, the Shrew deep in her heart admired the man whose temper is greater than her own." ...|$|E
