5|$|A {{downline}} {{used for}} open ocean diving {{is much the}} same as a shotline, but does not reach {{all the way to the}} bottom. An open-ocean downline is weighted at the bottom, and attached to a substantial float at the surface, which may be tethered to the boat. It may be marked at intervals by knots or loops, and may be attached to decompression trapeze system. In some cases a <b>sea</b> <b>anchor</b> may be used to limit wind drift, particularly if attached to a boat with significant windage.|$|E
5|$|In the whaleboat, Melville had, like De Long, ridden out {{the storm}} {{by means of a}} <b>sea</b> <b>anchor.</b> The boat's course was far to the south of De Long's; they finally reached land at one of the main mouths of the Lena, and were able to {{navigate}} upriver. Within a few days they encountered a native fishing camp, and by September 25 had reached the settlement of Arrhu. Chipp's cutter never reached land; overwhelmed by the storm, it presumably foundered, with the loss of all eight on board.|$|E
25|$|Overnight {{there was}} a strong {{northwest}} wind and heavy sea, drenching everyone in the boats. At first light on 24 October the boats could not see each other. Mr Vernon's boat hoisted its sail and set off before the wind, until at 1010 hrs his crew sighted the Third Officer's boat several miles to the southwest. They tried to steer towards it, but the heavy weather prevented them. At 1230 hrs Vernon abandoned the attempt and altered course to the southeast. At 1700 hrs he ordered the sail lowered and the boat to heave to with her <b>sea</b> <b>anchor.</b> At 2300 hrs the rudder broke off at the top pintle, so two of Vernon's men used an oar as an improvised and unsatisfactory steering oar. On 25 October the weather was still wild so Mr Vernon's boat drifted before the wind with her <b>sea</b> <b>anchor</b> and sail.|$|E

25|$|The first megamouth was {{captured}} on November 15, 1976 about 25 {{miles off the}} coast of Kāneohe, Hawaii, when it became entangled in the <b>sea</b> <b>anchor</b> of United States Navy ship AFB-14. Examination of the 4.5-m (14.7-ft), 750-kg (1,650-lb) specimen by Leighton Taylor showed it to be an entirely unknown type of shark, making it – along with the coelacanth – one of the more sensational discoveries in 20th-century ichthyology.|$|E
25|$|No. 5 {{boat was}} leaking badly and her crew were busy using their seaboots and empty cans to bale {{water out of}} her. At about 01:30 (local time) on 30 October they lost contact with the other lifeboats. Overnight the boat's crew rowed to keep the boat headed into the sea; at daybreak they raised her mast and hoisted a sail. At about 16:00 (local time) they {{deployed}} the boat's <b>sea</b> <b>anchor</b> overnight. At daybreak on 31 October they resumed sailing, and {{a few hours later}} sailed into sight of an Allied convoy.|$|E
25|$|Captain Mastin {{assembled}} a volunteer crew of nine men including {{himself and the}} Mate Edward Clarke. They reboarded the ship and extinguished the fire, and a party directed by the Chief Engineer J.S. Johnson got her dynamo and pumps started. The rescue tug took her in tow, but her ruined bow was still attached which worked as a large and unwieldy <b>sea</b> <b>anchor.</b> This limited their progress to about , and it took the tug 16 hours to tow Wandle to Great Yarmouth the next day. She was anchored off Yarmouth and her condition was deemed so precarious that she was abandoned a second time.|$|E

25|$|The crew of Adjuster {{abandoned}} her in sinking {{condition for the}} life raft which overturned and they spent the last hour clinging to it before rescue by Kingurra. The yacht Clwyd was swamped and eventually overturned when the keel fell off, the crew were rescued by Nynja Go then transferred to the radio relay vessel. The NZ yacht Swuzzlebubble VIII was rolled 360 degrees by a breaking wave, turtled, dismasted and swamped. On deck crew harnessed on were all recovered. The crew then cut the rig off, put out a No 3 headsil as a <b>sea</b> <b>anchor</b> and bailed her out while other yachts stood nearby. They managed to start the engine and motored into Eden. Meanwhile, Prime Factor of Adelaide came off a big wave at speed when the mast and the main bulkhead to which it was fastened pulled {{straight out of the}} deck of the boat and disappeared over the side. Two crew members of Advantaged were injured when the yacht capsized, snapping the mast off at the base, four crew were flung overboard but quickly recovered. The navigator was thrown through a bulkhead, head first. On Atara the mast slammed through the port side and it began taking water, but reached Eden where many sought shelter and carried out repairs. Brindabella a new Jutson 75 was retired with delamination at the bow, possibly after hitting a whale. By the end of 28 December 56 yachts had retired, a further 11 by the 30th see list below. At least one of the smallest yachts sheltered in NSW ports during the worst conditions and managed to complete the race within time.|$|E
500|$|I live by a creek, Tinker Creek, in {{a valley}} in Virginia's Blue Ridge. [...] An anchorite's hermitage is called an anchor-hold; some anchor-holds were simple sheds clamped {{to the side of}} a church like a {{barnacle}} or a rock. [...] I think of this house clamped to the side of Tinker Creek as an anchor-hold. [...] It holds me at anchor to the rock bottom of the creek itself and keeps me steadied in the current, as a <b>sea</b> <b>anchor</b> does, facing the stream of light pouring down.

500|$|Dorian's {{lifeboat}} was {{the smallest}} of the ship's boats and, with 26 crew and 5 passengers on board, had only a few inches of freeboard. [...] In worsening weather, Dorian improvised a rough <b>sea</b> <b>anchor,</b> which enabled the boat to ride the waves through the night and following day without being swamped. [...] In the late afternoon of September 28 they sighted a distant sail, which proved to be the Canadian bark Huron, bound for Quebec. [...] As they rowed towards their rescuer, they passed Peter McCabe, still clinging to the makeshift raft, the only one of its 72 occupants to have survived the night; he, too was taken on board Huron. [...] McCabe later recalled that he thought he was within ten minutes of death when he was rescued.|$|E

The James Caird was taking on water in heavy seas and in danger of sinking, kept afloat by continuous bailing. The temperature fell sharply, and a new danger presented itself in the accumulations of frozen spray, which threatened to capsize the boat. In turns, they had to crawl out on to the pitching deck with an axe and chip away the ice from deck and rigging. For 48hours they were stopped, held by a <b>sea</b> <b>anchor,</b> until the wind dropped sufficiently for them to raise sail and proceed. Despite their travails, Worsley's third observation, on 4 May, put them only [...] from South Georgia.|$|E
500|$|The boats {{made good}} {{progress}} through the morning, and Melville initially thought they might strike land after a single night at sea. In the afternoon the weather worsened; the boats separated and lost sight of each other. De Long used a <b>sea</b> <b>anchor</b> to stabilize his craft in the ferocious seas, and despite having his sail torn away by the wind, managed to hold a course to the west. The storm had largely subsided by the morning of September 14, but progress was erratic {{in the absence of}} the sail, and it was three more days before the cutter ran aground at the most northerly limit of the Lena Delta. De Long and his crew waded ashore, carrying their provisions from the boat, and prepared for a long foot journey. [...] Based on their map, the nearest settlement appeared to lie [...] away. De Long thought their rations would last for three-and-a-half days.|$|E

During splashdown, the Command Module landed upside down but was righted within 10 minutes by flotation bags triggered by the astronauts. [...] "Everything's okay. Our checklist is complete. Awaiting swimmers", was Armstrong's last official transmission from Columbia. A diver from the Navy helicopter hovering above attached a <b>sea</b> <b>anchor</b> to the Command Module {{to prevent it from}} drifting. Additional divers attached flotation collars to stabilize the module and position rafts for astronaut extraction. Though the chance of bringing back pathogens from the lunar surface was considered remote, it was considered a possibility and NASA took great precautions at the recovery site. Divers provided the astronauts with Biological Isolation Garments (BIGs) which were worn until they reached isolation facilities on board the Hornet. Additionally, astronauts were rubbed down with a sodium hypochlorite solution and the Command Module wiped with Betadine to remove any lunar dust that might be present. The raft containing decontamination materials was then intentionally sunk.|$|E

The rudders were made of elm– selected because it resisted splitting– and were [...] thick. The exterior of the boats were fitted with [...] "grablines" [...] {{for people in the}} water to hold on to. They were fitted with a variety of equipment to aid the occupants, comprising 10 oars, a <b>sea</b> <b>anchor,</b> two bailers, a painter (effectively a tow-rope) [...] long, two boat-hooks, two [...] tanks of fresh water, a mast and sail, a compass, a lantern and watertight metal provision tanks which contained biscuits. This equipment was not kept in the boats for fear of theft, but in locked boxes on the deck. In many cases, the equipment was not transferred to the boats when they were launched on 15 April and ended up going down with the ship. Blankets and a spare lifebelt could also be found in the boats. [...] Apparently unknown to many officers and crew, these boats were reinforced with steel beams in their keels to prevent buckling in the davits under a full load.|$|E
