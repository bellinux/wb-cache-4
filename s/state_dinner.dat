Nevertheless, Governor Frederick Weld held a formal reception and <b>state</b> <b>dinner</b> for him.|$|E

50|$|The Clintons {{were also}} {{the first to use}} the East Room for most <b>state</b> <b>dinners,</b> rather than the much smaller State Dining Room. The reason was size: The State Dining Room could {{accommodate}} only about 136 people, while the East Room sat 260. The Clintons also used marqees, set up on the South Lawn of the White House, for <b>state</b> <b>dinners,</b> which allowed seating to run as high as 700 individuals. President George W. Bush, however, returned to the practice of hosting <b>state</b> <b>dinners</b> almost exclusively in the State Dining Room. The gold-upholstered chairs were often removed for meals and replaced with smaller chairs from elsewhere in the White House, as they proved too bulky to accommodate large numbers of guests around dining tables.|$|R
5000|$|The {{dress code}} for <b>state</b> <b>dinners</b> is {{determined}} in advance by the White House Social Secretary {{in consultation with}} the Office of the First Lady of the United States. Black tie or mess dress is usually prescribed for <b>state</b> <b>dinners</b> during official visits, while <b>state</b> <b>dinners</b> during <b>state</b> visits may be either black tie or mess dress, or white tie with decorations or mess dress. The president of the United States has not customarily worn decorations, with some exceptions as in cases where he has been invested into an order of the visiting state. Where applicable, visitors may wear national costume instead of evening dress. [...] Visitors from socialist states, including Nikita Khrushchev and Hu Jintao, have, in the past, refused to wear evening dress.|$|R
5|$|In the White House, Clinton placed donated {{handicrafts}} {{of contemporary}} American artisans, such as pottery and glassware, on rotating {{display in the}} state rooms. She oversaw {{the restoration of the}} Blue Room to be historically authentic to the period of James Monroe and the Map Room to how it looked during World War II. Working with Arkansas interior decorator Kaki Hockersmith over an eight-year period, she oversaw extensive, privately funded redecoration efforts around the building, often trying to make it look brighter. These included changing the look of the Treaty Room, a presidential study, to along 19th century lines. Overall the redecoration brought mixed notices, with Victorian furnishings for the Lincoln Sitting Room being criticized the most. Clinton hosted many large-scale events at the White House, including a <b>state</b> <b>dinner</b> for visiting Chinese dignitaries, a New Year's Eve celebration {{at the turn of the}} 21st century and a <b>state</b> <b>dinner</b> honoring the bicentennial of the White House in November 2000.|$|E
5|$|The administration's {{diplomacy}} {{was also}} {{at work in the}} Pacific. In December 1874, Grant held a <b>state</b> <b>dinner</b> at the White House for the King of Hawaii, David Kalakaua, who was seeking duty-free sugar importation to the US. Grant and Fish secured a free trade treaty in 1875 with the Kingdom of Hawaii, incorporating the Pacific islands' sugar industry into the United States' economic sphere.|$|E
5|$|Having made {{considerable}} progress {{over the}} previous two years in U.S.-Soviet relations, Nixon embarked on a second trip to the Soviet Union in 1974. He arrived in Moscow on June 27 to a welcome ceremony, cheering crowds, and a <b>state</b> <b>dinner</b> at the Grand Kremlin Palace that evening. Nixon and Brezhnev met in Yalta, where they discussed a proposed mutual defense pact, détente, and MIRVs. While he considered proposing a comprehensive test-ban treaty, Nixon felt he would not have time as president to complete it. There were no significant breakthroughs in these negotiations.|$|E
50|$|This room, {{the largest}} in the Palace today, is also known as the Ballroom, used for <b>state</b> <b>dinners</b> and large assemblies, notably the mass oath takings of public {{officials}} begun by President Ramos. The upholstered benches are lined up for guests on such occasions. When the room is used for <b>state</b> <b>dinners,</b> the benches are removed and round tables set in place. Orchestras sometimes play from the minstrels' galleries at two ends of the hall.|$|R

5|$|In 1978, Nixon {{published}} his memoirs, RN: The Memoirs of Richard Nixon, {{the first of}} ten books he was to author in his retirement. The book was a bestseller and attracted a generally positive critical response. Nixon visited the White House in 1979, invited by Carter for the <b>state</b> <b>dinner</b> for Chinese Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping. Carter had not wanted to invite Nixon, but Deng had stated he would visit Nixon in California if the former president was not invited. Nixon had a private meeting with Deng and visited Beijing again in mid-1979.|$|E
5|$|The 1881 {{world tour}} of King Kalākaua of the Kingdom of Hawaii was {{his attempt to}} save the Hawaiian culture and {{population}} from extinction through the importation of a labor force from Asia-Pacific nations. His efforts brought the small island nation {{to the attention of}} world leaders, but sparked rumors that the kingdom was for sale. In Hawaii there were critics who believed the labor negotiations were just his excuse to see the world. The 281-day trip gave him the distinction of being the first monarch to circumnavigate the globe, just as his 1874 travels had made him the first reigning monarch to visit America and the first honoree of a <b>state</b> <b>dinner</b> at the White House.|$|E
5|$|Years later Armstrong {{remembered the}} {{invitation}} to join the tour as having arisen in a casual conversation, during {{which he did not}} believe the King was serious. He realized the proposed tour was not just idle conversation when the King informed his Cabinet of his plans and chose Armstrong, Judd, and his personal cook Robert von Oelhoffen as his only traveling companions. At a <b>state</b> <b>dinner</b> held by Kalākaua and his ministers a week before departure, Armstrong spoke of their youthful dreams of sailing around the world finally being brought to fruition.|$|E

5|$|The King and {{his small}} group spent just under three weeks on their tour of Japan. They were {{formally}} welcomed at the Tokyo Imperial Palace {{and taken to}} Shintomiza, the Imperial Theatre, to be entertained by a kabuki drama. The following day Emperor Meiji held a <b>state</b> <b>dinner</b> for his visitors. The Emperor presented the King with two suits of Japanese armor, and bestowed upon him the Order of the Chrysanthemum with Badge, and the Star of the Order. The King reciprocated with a royal painting of Queen Kapiolani and himself, and presented the Emperor with the Grand Cross of Kamehameha. In the same ceremony, Judd and Armstrong were given the Order of the Rising Sun. By way of understanding local education and industries, the King toured the College of the Imperial Guard, Imperial Engineering College, and the Oji Paper Company. Two of Japan's generals gave him a guided tour through the empire's arsenal.|$|E
5|$|The {{titles and}} styling of Her Excellency The Rev. Sir Doctor Stephen Tyrone Mos Def Colbert, D.F.A., Heavyweight Champion of the World✱✱ {{featuring}} Flo Rida La Premiere Dame De France are mostly for comedic reasons. Colbert became an ordained minister on June 2, 2011, granting himself {{the title of}} Reverend. Colbert was mock-knighted by Queen Noor of Jordan on April 7, 2009, bestowing him with the title of Sir. He was granted an honorary doctorate of fine arts by Knox College in 2006, giving him the title of Doctor {{and use of the}} suffix D.F.A. (Doctor of Fine Arts). This title is featured regularly during his segments Cheating Death with Dr. Stephen T. Colbert, DFA. Yasiin Bey gave Colbert the use of his stage name Mos Def on October 5, 2011. Colbert was set to interview Mike Tyson on July 23, 2013. Tyson did not appear which led Colbert to declare himself Heavy Weight Champion of the World and grant himself use of the title. The large asterisk in the title is to denote that he did not defeat Tyson in a boxing match. The suffix featuring Flo Rida was added during the segment I tried to sign up for Obamacare on October 23, 2013, where his name on the ACA form said featuring Flo Rida. Her Excellency was added to the title as Colbert was seated next to Michelle Obama at the White House <b>state</b> <b>dinner</b> in February 2014, in which the President of France François Hollande was not accompanied by a partner. Because it is customary that the first lady of a visiting nation is seated next to the First Lady of the United States, Colbert proclaimed himself First Lady of France on February 12, 2014.|$|E
