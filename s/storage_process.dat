2500|$|Opponents {{say that}} nuclear power poses {{numerous}} threats {{to people and}} the environment and point to studies in the literature that question if it will ever be a sustainable energy source. These threats include health risks, accidents and environmental damage from uranium mining, processing and transport. [...] Along with the fears associated with nuclear weapons proliferation, nuclear power opponents fear sabotage by terrorists of nuclear plants, diversion and misuse of radioactive fuels or fuel waste, as well as naturally-occurring leakage from the unsolved and imperfect long-term <b>storage</b> <b>process</b> of radioactive nuclear waste. They also contend that reactors themselves are enormously complex machines where many things can and do go wrong, {{and there have been}} many serious nuclear accidents. Critics do not believe that these risks can be reduced through new technology. They further argue that when all the energy-intensive stages of the nuclear fuel chain are considered, from uranium mining to nuclear decommissioning, nuclear power is not a low-carbon electricity source.|$|E
2500|$|Superconducting {{magnetic}} energy storage (SMES) systems store energy in the magnetic field created by the flow of direct current in a [...] superconducting coil which has been cryogenically cooled to a temperature below its superconducting critical temperature. A typical SMES system includes three parts: superconducting coil, power conditioning system and cryogenically cooled refrigerator. Once the superconducting coil is charged, the current will not decay and the {{magnetic energy}} can be stored indefinitely. The stored energy can be released back to the network by discharging the coil. The power conditioning system uses an inverter/rectifier to transform alternating current (AC) power to direct current or convert DC back to AC power. The inverter/rectifier accounts for about 2–3% energy loss in each direction. SMES loses {{the least amount of}} electricity in the energy <b>storage</b> <b>process</b> compared to other methods of storing energy. SMES systems are highly efficient; the round-trip efficiency is greater than 95%. The high cost of superconductors is the primary limitation for commercial use of this energy storage method.|$|E

40|$|Photochemical {{energy storage}} in {{isolated}} bundle sheath cells from Zea mays was examined. Photoacoustic spectroscopy {{was used in}} this study to monitor energy <b>storage</b> <b>processes.</b> The presence of methyl viologen or addition of substrates which activated carbon fixation, prevented energy <b>storage</b> <b>processes</b> through the electron transport system. The energy storage was inhibited completely by dibromothymoquinone (DBMIB) and DCMU, inhibitors of noncyclic electron flow. However, the reductants such as dithiothreitol and ascorbate increased the energy storage. It was concluded that photosystem (PS) I may be reduced by some electron donor(s) other than water and that PSII only partially participates in PSI reduction. It is postulated that the role of PSII is to regulate PSI electron transport and prevent its overoxidation. In the presence of high level of malate, photoacoustic spectroscopy indicated a low energy storage which may be due to induction of energy utilization in carbon assimilation...|$|R

Also, the <b>storage</b> <b>process</b> can become corrupted by physical damage to areas of the brain that are associated with memory storage, such as the hippocampus (Squire, 2009). Finally, the retrieval of information from long-term memory can be disrupted because of decay within long-term memory (Eysenck, 2012).
