50|$|Stadia marks, {{also called}} <b>stadia</b> <b>lines</b> or stadia hairs, are {{crosshairs}} on the reticle of a theodolite or other surveying instrument that allow stadiametric rangefinding.|$|E
50|$|The stadia {{method of}} {{distance}} measurement is primarily historical for surveying purposes, as distance nowadays is mostly measured by electronic or taping methods. Total station instruments {{do not have}} <b>stadia</b> <b>lines</b> marked on the reticle. Traditional methods are still used in areas where modern instruments are not common or by aficionados to antique surveying methods.|$|E
50|$|The M67 {{recoilless}} rifle was a 90 mm anti-tank {{recoilless rifle}} {{made in the}} United States {{and later in the}} Republic of Korea. It could also be employed in an anti-personnel role {{with the use of the}} M590 antipersonnel round. It was designed to be fired primarily from the ground using the bipod and monopod, but could also be fired from the shoulder using the folded bipod as a shoulder rest and the monopod as a front grip. The weapon was air-cooled and breech-loaded, and fired fixed ammunition. It is a direct fire weapon employing <b>stadia</b> <b>lines</b> to allow simple range finding, based on a typical tank target bridging the lines once in range.|$|E
25|$|The semi-final of the 2012 Norwegian Football Cup {{was played}} at Høddvoll, drawing 6,261 spectators, where Hødd won 3–1. After Hødd won the 2012 Cup Final, the team {{qualified}} for second qualification {{round of the}} 2013–14 UEFA Europa League. A major issue was if the club {{would be allowed to}} play their games at Høddvoll, or would have to use the more modern <b>stadia</b> Color <b>Line</b> Stadion in Ålesund or Aker Stadion in Molde. UEFA gave Høddvoll a green light in June. Hødd won 1–0 of Aktobe in Høddvoll's only European football match, but lost 1–2 in aggregate. The match sold old, drawing 2,019 spectators.|$|R
50|$|The missile {{system could}} be {{deployed}} {{in a number of}} configurations. The man-portable configuration consists of a launcher which doubles up as a transport container, a combined sight and controller, a battery and a 63 meter long cable. An optional Missile Selector Box allowed up to 6 missiles to be controlled by, and widely separated from, a single sight controller. The launcher box is placed on the ground facing the direction of expected targets, and then connected by the cable to the sight controller, which can be deployed some distance away. The sight controller is a pistol grip design, with two grips. The front grip has the launch trigger, and the rear grip has a thumb joystick for steering the missile. A low-magnification (3.2x) monocular forms the sight itself. Engraved <b>stadia</b> <b>lines</b> allow simple ranging, based on a typical tank target bridging the lines once in range.|$|E
