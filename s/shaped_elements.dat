50|$|Cramer was {{a member}} of the Zürich section of the Werkbund, headed by the Bauhaus member Johannes Itten and the Swiss {{sculptor}} Max Bill, and became more and more interested in a modern method of garden design. About 1950 Cramer dramatically changed his style and started designing modern architectural gardens. His friendship and cooperation with many modern Swiss artists and his strong interest in modern architecture reinforced his will to find a new language in garden architecture. In particular, the temporary exhibition projects of Cramer are among the most remarkable creations of modern garden architecture in Europe. Most impressive were his contributions to national and international garden exhibitions, for example, the first national garden show in Zürich G|59 (1959) and the IGA international garden exhibition in Hamburg (1963). The abstract basic conception of his gardens, the renunciation of superfluous decoration, and the use of concrete and geometrically <b>shaped</b> <b>elements</b> caused considerable irritation among his professional colleagues and added to his international reputation.|$|E

Another {{key feature}} of Saltoposuchus includes a non-preforated acetabulum (hip joint), {{which is a}} defining characteristic of all dinosaurs. Saltoposuchus were also considered to be bipedal based on its skeletal constitution, but could walk on all four limbs as well, making it a facultative biped. Saltoposuchus also had a double row of bony Scutes along its back, which {{can be seen on}} modern crocodilians today. Like with other Sphenosuchians and early crocodylomorphs, Saltoposuchus had fully erect slender limbs, a slender body, and long legs. Paleontologists believe that with their body structures that Saltoposuchus were very fast and nimble. Sphenosuchians are described as [...] "greyhound dogs with scales and a long tail." [...] Early crocodylomorphs, such as Saltoposuchus, have very long centra in their vertabrae, short vertebral processes, and medium-sized zygapophyseal joints. Molnar et Al. concluded that the average mediolateral range of motion in the early crocodylomorphs was greater than dorsoventral range of motion, and dorsoventral stiffness was estimated to be higher than mediolateral stiffness. In the wrists of Saltoposuchus, the radiale and ulnare are elongated into rod <b>shaped</b> <b>elements</b> instead of being button-shaped, which is a shared characteristic among crocodylomorphs.|$|E
50|$|Callbach’s {{church was}} first built in 1334, {{but over the}} course of history it has several times been {{destroyed}} and then built over again. In 1782, after a third reconstruction by the Ducal Zweibrücken Building Director Friedrich Gerhard Wahl, the aisleless church assumed its current shape. Held at the church are services of the Evangelical faith, whose members make up a majority of some 80% in the village. The rectangular building rises on a slope overlooking Kirchstraße (“Church Street”), and access thereto is gained by way of a stairway up to a portal. Because of the sloped site, the church is underpinned in part by a simple vaulted cellar. The cellar’s façade towards the street is faced with sandstone blocks. The building as a whole follows the east-west orientation that is traditionally typical of church buildings. The monochromatically white plastered façade with its <b>shaped</b> <b>elements</b> in the Classicist style is framed by corner lesenes made of natural stone. The portal and the windows along the middle axis and a gable with a round window accentuate this straight-lined entrance façade. Beginning in 1993, the church - which is a parish church - was renovated in two phases. The exterior was done in 1993-1995, while the interior was done in 1998-1999. The overhaul and conversion brought into existence a newly structured multifunctional space inside the church. The inside, with its new colour scheme, now also offers rooms that may be used for various functions and purposes. The new spatial concept made it necessary to rearrange the seating and the original lateral alignment to the altar and the pulpit along the aisleless church’s side wall. The stone slabs on the church floor with their signs of wear, the pews and the simple wooden table altar were overhauled and restored. A sandstone stele with a gilt baptismal font made according to current designs completes the church’s furnishings. The building-in of a kitchenette, chair storage, a lavatory facility and rooms with movable walls allow the parishioners to arrange the space for the most varied of occasions. Besides the church services and liturgical exercises, the church is also used for meetings and cultural events.|$|E
