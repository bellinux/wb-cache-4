25|$|After MacDonald and Eddy left MGM in 1943, they {{appeared}} frequently on radio together while planning several unrealized films {{that would have}} reunited them onscreen. Eddy was upset at how his first film turned out at Universal, so their joint project at that studio fell through. They next sought independent financing for team projects like East Wind and Crescent Carnival, a book optioned by MacDonald. Other thwarted projects were The Rosary, a 1910 best seller (which Nelson Eddy pitched for a team comeback at MGM), The Desert Song, and a remake of The Vagabond King, plus two movie treatments written by Eddy, Timothy Waits for Love and All Stars Don't <b>Spangle.</b> In 1954, Eddy pulled out of yet another proposed team film {{to be made in}} England when he learned MacDonald was investing her own funds. He had invested in 1944's Knickerbocker Holiday, and had lost money.|$|E
