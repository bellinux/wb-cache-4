40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} wheelchair <b>stair</b> <b>lift</b> with an intelligent control system that aim to apply for helping the mobility of ageing, disabled and wheelchair people who are suffered from any inconvenience causes of building stair usages and also served for the fire stair evacuation path in the same time. The <b>stair</b> <b>lift</b> is controlled by PLC with the fuzzy proportional plus integral (F-PI) controller combined on their driver functions called as fuzzy ladder control which can generate an appropriate setting voltage and torque to maintain a target position and speed of <b>stair</b> <b>lift</b> when it move along the stair path with shorter time of accessing, travelling and dwelling process. To gain the precise value of target position and speed, the DC motor drive with smart steering gear box that are coupled on two stair guide rails is designed for acting easily as a linear moving control by F-PI controller. By several tests of the unknown characteristics of wheelchair users, the F-PI controller can solve this kind of problems with more efficiency because of the main advantage of fuzzy logic is that no mathematical model is required but can be achieved higher performance with the effective tuning parameters especially in an initial setting process. For more efficiency, the RFID detection method is applied to use for identifying and automatically accessing of wheelchair users who want to use this <b>stair</b> <b>lift</b> with some important data such as their name, ag...|$|R

50|$|Split level homes {{tend to be}} {{designed}} with multiple internal stairways and half-floor landings inside the building. There may be an entrance area inside the building at ground level, with stairs inside the entrance that immediately {{go up and down}} from the ground level. These homes are difficult to accommodate inexpensively since there is often no space available inside the structure to install long sloping wheelchair ramps to access the various floors. It may be possible to retrofit <b>stair</b> <b>lifts</b> into the stairwells or wheelchair lifts into balconies near the stairwell.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} new home for the aging baby boomers. The US is about to see a massive influx in the elderly population, and the current model of housing the elderly is woefully unprepared. The boomer {{generation}} has lived in single family homes for decades, and will want to continue living in one. Current strategies for retrofitting homes for seniors, things like wheelchair ramps, <b>stair</b> <b>lifts,</b> grab bars, are remark-ably ill-suited to properly accommodate {{the needs of the}} elderly. Incorporating embedded computation into the home will allow the elderly to maintain their independence, and live in an environment which accommo-dates their expanding and changing needs as they deteriorate both mentally and physically. The home will {{take an active role in}} monitoring the occupant, monitoring itself, adapting to the changing physical/mental dexterity of the occupants, as well as assisting with domestic activities.

40|$|For every society, it is {{important}} to know the effective and efficient health care interventions that ensure a more efficient use of scarce health care resources. Care of dementia is extremely resource demanding and has a great impact on both the formal care systems and the condition for informal carers. Occupational therapy (OT) is likely to be useful in dementia care. It is also recommended by the occupational therapists that a <b>stair</b> <b>lift</b> is the right solution for old or many younger individuals with disabilities who want to stay independently in their own home. From the policy perspective, nonetheless, the questions of cost-effectiveness of such interventions are vital. This study aims to assess whether municipality occupational therapy is a costeffective service option for home-based persons with reduced function in Norway. Two types of subjects have been considered for the analyses: older patients with dementia and people who use and are supposed to need a <b>stair</b> <b>lift</b> in their apartments. To get the information regarding the OT intervention and its effects on the differences in health care quantities used by the dementia patients between case (OT users) and control (usual care users) groups, a rigorous literature review has been conducted. Based on our literature search, we have considered the study from the Netherlands (the study based on randomized control trials). We estimate economic benefits/costs from the point of societal perspective. Employing the number of health care units used per patient during three months follow-up period that estimated in the study from the Netherlands, and using Norwegian wages/prices for different health care units, we present a hybrid estimate of the economic effects of OT intervention for the dementia patient in Norway. All costs have been calculated from the employee costs multiplied by a percentage for employer premiums as social taxes, holidays, and employee other benefits. Overall, our estimates indicate that community OT intervention for people with dementia is cost-effective in Norway. Our estimates demonstrate that with a probability of 95 %, on average it saves NOK 42, 427 (95 % CI: 33, 678 and 51, 176) over three months per successfully treated dementia patient with OT. The main cost savings are from reduced informal care for the intervention group (NOK 48, 387. 42), around 90 % of total costs are owing to informal care costs. Based on the information collected through a small scale interviews with the user of a <b>stair</b> <b>lift</b> and potential-user (persons that have been concluded to need a <b>stair</b> <b>lift,</b> and are waiting for the installation), a quantitative cost-effectiveness analysis has been conducted. From the self-assessed descriptions provided by the informants, it is rather apparent that having a <b>stair</b> <b>lift</b> is effective in improving the users’ daily livings, quality of life, and reducing informal cares time. Based on some restrictive assumptions, it seems that the intervention is cost-effective as well. From a societal view point, particularly in terms of informal care costs, our tentative conclusion is that community OT appears to be a cost-effective intervention strategy for the patients with dementia in Norway. Similar conclusion can also be drawn for the <b>stair</b> <b>lift</b> intervention. Yet, to be more confident on our conclusions, we recommend further comprehensive research on these issues...|$|R
30|$|The {{fractures}} {{were treated}} nonoperatively with elastic tubular bandage. The patient was advised to avoid pulling herself up the banister with her forearms.

50|$|In {{multi-story}} commercial buildings, shear walls form {{at least}} one core (Figure 3). From a building services perspective, the shear core houses communal services including <b>stairs,</b> <b>lifts,</b> toilets and service risers. Building serviceability requirements necessitates a proper arrangement of a shear core. From the structural point of view, a shear core could strengthen the building’s resistance to lateral loads, i.e., wind load and seismic load, and significantly increase the building safety.|$|R
25|$|The {{ticket hall}} for the railway station opens off {{the centre of}} {{eastern side of the}} concourse, and in turn gives access via ticket {{barriers}} to a pedestrian overbridge with <b>stairs</b> and <b>lifts</b> down to the railway platforms.
