500|$|In June 2010, when Jill's adoptive mother, Liz Foster (Julianna McCarthy), died, it {{was then}} learned that her {{biological}} father was Neil Fenmore. Walton stated: [...] "Liz was the dream mother for Jill. She always could handle Jill." [...] During an interview with On-Air On-Soaps speaking about how her character has been thrown in different directions, Walton said: [...] "It used to bother me. I would try and keep a steady course with it, and now I can’t. Now I just roll with the punches. It’s impossible." [...] Walton noted that Jill was finally {{happy to have a}} blood relative through Neil's other daughter, Lauren Fenmore (Tracey E. Bregman). She said: [...] "Liz dies within a week {{and all of a sudden}} it’s, 'I am a Fenmore'. And we really didn’t have a chance to explore it much, but in real life that happens. My first thought as Jill is, 'I actually know who my blood is, and I have a sister.' And, Jill was very moved and touched and shocked from the death of Liz, but full of love for her sister." [...] On her relationship with Lauren, Walton stated that, [...] "Most people don’t like Jill, and she hasn’t particularly loved Lauren. I have never had that much to do with Lauren, really." [...] Nekeeta Borden of Zap2it noted: [...] "The redhead told Jill in no uncertain terms that she intended to keep her father’s memory, and only child status, firmly in tact [...] and had no interest in a close relationship." [...] Borden also noted that Jill always wanted a sense of belonging, which prompted her to legally change her name to Jill Fenmore. The sisters were initially bitter towards each other having to share half of the Fenmore Boutique, but have since gotten closer. Walton said that, [...] "From my point of view, I think that Lauren has a really big heart; she's a naturally lovely person. Lauren was really awful a few times, and that just came out of her pain. <b>So,</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> Lauren and Jill are kind of getting along okay, but there's nothing else coming up in the scripts for them yet." ...|$|E
