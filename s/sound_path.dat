5000|$|Due to the {{relative}} age of the technology, it may be beneficial to discuss {{the operation of the}} multipath ultrasonic meter to illustrate the effects of flow profile distortion and swirl. There are various types of flow measurements utilizing high frequency sound. The custody transfer measurement devices available today utilize the time of travel concept. The difference in time of flight with the flow is compared to the time of flight against the flow. This difference is used to infer average flow velocity on the <b>sound</b> <b>path.</b> Fig.(5) showing the Ultrasonic Meter <b>sound</b> <b>path</b> no flow which illustrates this concept.The resulting flow equation for the mean velocity experienced by the <b>sound</b> <b>path</b> is given by, [...] ----(5)The case of no flow gives the actual path of the sound when there is zero flow (by equating eq.(5) to zero). In case of theoretical flow profile, say a uniform velocity flow profile where the no-slip condition on the pipe walls is not applied, Fig.(6) shows Ultrasonic Meter <b>sound</b> <b>path</b> - uniform velocity profile which illustrates the resultant sound path.A theoretical derivation of the Mean velocity equation for this <b>sound</b> <b>path</b> becomes much more complicated.

Hence the real performance of ultrasonic meters downstream of perturbations, and the need for calibrations is required.|$|E

Acoustic quieting, noise mitigation, and noise control can be used to limit unwanted noise. Soundproofing can suppress unwanted indirect sound waves such as reflections that cause echoes and resonances that cause reverberation. Soundproofing can reduce the transmission of unwanted direct sound waves from the source to an involuntary listener through the use of distance and intervening objects in the <b>sound</b> <b>path.</b>|$|E

Comparing with methods that assume flat frequency characteristics, the proposed method improves dereverberation performance.

40|$|Using the {{phenomenon}} of extraordinary sound transmission (EST) through artificially constructed density-near-zero (DNZ) materials, we propose an alternative approach to realize a very robust acoustic cloaking, which includes one absorber and one projector connected by an energy channel. The elementary unit cell is made of one single-piece homogeneous copper, but it well maintains both the original planar wavefront and the nearly perfect one-dimensional transmission, {{in the presence of}} any inserted objects. Furthermore, the overall cloaked space can be increased, designed, and distributed by arbitrarily assembling additional DNZ cells without any upper limit in the total cloaking volume. We demonstrate acoustic cloaking by different combinations of DNZ cells in free space as well as in acoustic waveguides, which enables any objects inside the cells imperceptible along undistorted <b>sound</b> <b>paths...</b>|$|R

More specifically, it is necessary that the dimensions of the rooms or obstacles in the <b>sound</b> <b>path</b> should be much greater than the wavelength.

50|$|TL is the {{transmission}} loss in decibels, MS and BS are respectively masking and ambient sound levels in decibels. The speech weighting factors W are those listed with Articulation Index. The first two ratings {{account for the}} high sound loss at frequencies that are important for intelligibility. ESL treats {{the difference between the}} masking spectrum and the background spectrum as an additional loss. The figure on the right shows the Speech Loss for a furniture panel with high STC; it is the excess loss caused by sound diffraction over the panel. The Effective Speech Loss is higher and shows sound masking as if it were part of the partition. The masking level for this example was set at 47 dB(A) and the background level was 39 dB(A). This graph demonstrates the significant value of sound masking when it acts as an additional panel height. It is clear that the level used in the graph only would be necessary for low panel heights, but is excessive with higher panels. The graph also demonstrates the panel tradeoff with sound masking. Adding masking permits lower panels to achieve the same speech loss. Adding masking roughly permits a reduction of at least 12 inches in panel height so there can be a significant cost savings.The reflection of speech from a ceiling in an open office depends on the sound absorbing characteristics of the ceiling tile and the height of the suspended ceiling. Because ceiling tiles tend to absorb the higher frequencies better, the speech loss is relatively good, as seen in the figure on the right. It should be noted that an upgrade in NRC rating adds expense but not always appreciable speech privacy improvement. A goal of SL=20 for the ceiling would require the panel height to be at least 60-66 inches to balance the two paths with added masking, otherwise, the panel would be the weakest <b>sound</b> <b>path.</b> Higher ceilings also increase sound diffusion for masking speakers in the ceiling plenum, increasing acceptability.|$|E
