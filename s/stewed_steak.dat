50|$|The Spanish Army issues an {{individual}} meal pack, available in 5 different menus, comprising a small cardboard box overwrapped with drab green polyethylene. Inside are 3 canned meals, plus accessories. Typical contents (Menu B) include: <b>stewed</b> <b>steak,</b> pickled mackerel, liver pâté with red peppers, an envelope of instant soup, {{a can of}} fruit, 2 salt tablets, 2 water purification tablets, a large multivitamin tablet, 10 sheets of general purpose paper, a book of matches, a folding can opener, a small folding ration heater and 2 fuel tablets, and an instruction sheet in three languages (Spanish, English and French). Crackers or bread are issued separately.|$|E

5000|$|A steak pie is a {{traditional}} meat pie served in Britain. It is made from <b>stewing</b> <b>steak</b> and beef gravy, enclosed in a pastry shell. Sometimes mixed vegetables {{are included in the}} filling. The dish is often served with [...] "steak chips" [...] (thickly sliced potatoes fried, sometimes fried in beef dripping). Steak pies are also available from chip shops, served with normal chips, referred to in Scotland as a steak pie supper.|$|R
5000|$|A variant lobscaws or lobsgaws is a {{traditional}} dish in North Wales, normally made with braising or <b>stewing</b> <b>steak,</b> potatoes, and any other vegetable available, or made with mutton it is known as cawl. The food was traditionally regarded as food for farmers and the working-class people of North Wales, but is now popular as a dish throughout Wales. The recipe was brought by the canal barges [...] to Stoke-on-Trent, where it is called [...] "lobby", the shortened version of [...] "lobscouse".|$|R
5000|$|In St. Helens, {{the dish}} {{is often called}} [...] "lobbies" [...] and uses corned beef as the meat. In Wigan [...] "lobbies" [...] is often made using tinned <b>stewing</b> <b>steak</b> as the meat. A further variety of the dish is [...] "blind Scouse", made without meat, {{although}} it would likely have used cheap [...] "soup bones" [...] for flavouring the broth (prior to WW2, such meat bones could be sold to bone dealers after being used and for the same price as originally purchased from the butcher [...] ). The dish is also popular in Leigh with local residents sometimes being referred to as 'Lobbygobblers'.|$|R
50|$|Cecina is cured meat {{made from}} beef or horse, {{and it is}} {{considered}} as a delicacy. Foal meat (carne de potro) is preferred rather than horse meat, and {{it is easy to}} find in supermarkets and usually prepared as <b>stew</b> or <b>steak.</b> It is a common practice to give it to children with anemia. Although no generalized taboo exists in Spain, its consumption is minor compared to pork, beef, and lamb.|$|R
50|$|Secondo : This course {{may include}} {{different}} meats {{and types of}} fish, including turkey, sausage, pork, <b>steak,</b> <b>stew,</b> beef, zampone, salt cod, stockfish, salmon, lobster, lamb, chicken, or a roast. The primo or the secondo piatto may be considered more important depending on the locality and the situation.|$|R
40|$|Background: Preparatory steps such as seasoning, marination, {{and cooking}} may induce changes in meat which affects {{the ability of}} the stomach to {{adequately}} digest it. This may result in peptide chains reaching the colon intact where resident bacteria ferment them resulting in the formation of putative carcinogenic phenolic by-products. Objective: In this study, we set out to determine whether peptic digestion of beef myofibrils was influenced by prior marination. Design: Cubes of sirloin <b>stewing</b> <b>steak</b> were marinated in balsamic vinegar or left untreated at 4 &#x 00 B 0;C overnight. Samples were oven cooked and myofibrils were extracted. Myofibrils were subject to proteolytic digestion with pepsin and digestion products analysed spectrophotometrically and with gel electrophoresis. Results: Both marination in balsamic vinegar and cooking significantly reduced the yield of myofibrils from shop-purchased beef (P&# 60; 0. 05). Digestion progressed in all samples as a function of time (P&# 60; 0. 01), varying depending on prior treatment. Marination induced resistance to the digestive effect of pepsin during the early to mid-phase of digestion, and we identified a protein band of &#x 223 C; 150 kDa which was protected from peptic digestion in samples which had been marinated and cooked, but not in any other groups. Conclusions: Pre-treatment of meat prior to cooking may influence specific peptides such that they become more resistant to the digestive actions of pepsin...|$|R
50|$|These early lunches {{initially}} included {{items such}} as bread, bread rolls, and skimmed milk powder (replaced in 1958 by milk bottles and cartons). Later, lunches were expanded to include flour donated by an American charity; a dessert; and a dish (such as daikon) that changed daily. Other dishes included inexpensive protein such as stewed bean dishes, fried white fish, and, until the 1970s, whale meat. Provisions of rice were introduced in 1976, following a surplus of government-distributed Japanese rice, and became increasingly frequent during the 1980s. Hamburg <b>steak,</b> <b>stew</b> and Japanese curry became staples as well.|$|R
5000|$|Motorists {{in western}} Canada are at some risk of colliding with bears. Bear {{collisions}} {{have also been}} reported in Ontario. Bears killed by accident may be donated to needy people for their meat. There is some risk of trichinellosis if bear meat contaminated with Trichinella nativa is under-cooked. In 2008, protesters blocking a new highway in British Columbia set up a kitchen in their camp where they cooked raccoon <b>stew,</b> venison <b>steaks,</b> and bunny burgers using roadkill collected from the TransCanada Highway.Moose were introduced to Newfoundland in 1878, and are now abundant - and a road hazard at night. Until recently, moose that were cleanly killed in road accidents were given to charitable groups. However, in April 2009 the Department of Natural Resources stated {{that they were going}} to stop this practice, citing concerns about the provenance. A spokesman stated the department would no longer be: [...] "providing roadkill under which we have no idea about the health of the animal, we have no idea about how the animal was butchered".|$|R
6000|$|Peetoot, whose {{spirit that}} night {{seemed to be}} {{intoxicated}} with success, and who {{felt that he was}} the lion of the night (after Annatock!), seated himself astride of one of the dead seals, and was dragged into camp on this novel sledge, shouting a volley of unintelligible jargon {{at the top of his}} voice, in the midst of which [...] "Eeduck" [...] frequently resounded. At length the last lingerer arrived, and then began a feast of the most extraordinary kind. The walrus-flesh was first conveyed to the igloo of Annatock, where it was cut up and distributed among the natives. The women seemed quite frantic with joy, and went about from hut to hut embracing one another, by way of congratulation. Soon the lamps of the village were swimming with oil, the <b>steaks</b> <b>stewing</b> and roasting, the children provided with pieces of raw blubber to keep them quiet while the larger portions were being cooked, and the entire community gormandising and rejoicing as savages are wont to do when suddenly visited with plenty in the midst of starvation.|$|R
50|$|These cafeterias {{featured}} {{prepared foods}} behind small glass windows and coin-operated slots, beginning with buns, beans, fish cakes and coffee. These were popular, busy restaurants, {{where in the}} late 1950s, for under $1.00, one could enjoy a large, if somewhat plain meal, purchased with nickels usually obtained from the cashier. Each stack of glass-doored dispensers had a metal cylinder that could be rotated by the staff {{on the other side}} of the vending wall, hiding the contents while they refilled each dispenser in the stack with a plate of salad, pudding, meat or vegetables. Each dispenser had a slot for one or more nickels, and a knob to rotate the nickels out of view into the internal cash box and to allow the glass door to be raised up and locked in a horizontal position for easy removal of the plate or bowl of food. More expensive items required tokens valued up to 75¢ which were available from the cashier. Some of the rectangular dispensers were heated, some cooled. Eventually, they served lunch and dinner entrees, such as beef <b>stew</b> and Salisbury <b>steak</b> with mashed potatoes. The self-service restaurants operated in the city for nearly a century.|$|R
