25|$|In the 1960s, {{competition}} forced diversification and AMT added {{new product}} lines, specifically trucks. For example, its early Dirt Hauler kit {{was merely a}} generic tractor-trailer with dumping trailer. Then, in 1969, AMT released the California Hauler 359 kit. This new kit was a revolution for model building, a realistic model of a Peterbilt 359 tractor-trailer, the design having been copied from the manufacturer's specifications. It also had an authentic 8V71 Detroit Diesel engine under the hood. The kit lacked a <b>sleeper</b> <b>cab,</b> {{but there was a}} coupon that could be sent in along with ten cents to get it. The following year, the second version was issued with a <b>sleeper</b> <b>cab.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Scania PRT-range, also {{referred}} to as new truck range or Scania's truck range, is the current range of trucks manufactured by the Swedish commercial vehicle manufacturer Scania. It was first introduced as the successor to the 4-series in spring 2004 with the high forward control cab Scania R-series, followed by the low forward control cab Scania P-series and bonneted cab Scania T-series later in the year. The T-series was discontinued in 2005, and in 2007 the medium forward control cab Scania G-series was introduced. The entire range is modular, giving a wide range of different configurations for different types of trucks. The trucks are available with engines ranging from a 9-litre I5 to a 16-litre V8, with the V8 only being available in the R-series (and formerly T-series). A successor to the range was launched in August 2016 with new R-series and flat-floor S-series <b>sleeper</b> <b>cabs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Using {{a special}} design allows the reuse {{of the old}} wayside signals - the {{transparent}} data balises {{are connected to the}} older distant and stop signals. Given the lower maximum speed of the rapid transit system the Eurobalises can be placed at shorter distance (every four <b>sleepers).</b> The <b>cab</b> computer software is much simpler as the weight of the train can be inferred from an assumed maximum. The sum of advantages makes the system faster and cheaper than using a plain ECTS level 1 train protection system.|$|R
40|$|Copyright © 2008 SAE International Several {{configurations}} of truck tractor <b>sleeper</b> <b>cabs</b> were tested and modeled {{to investigate the}} potential to reduce heating and cooling loads. Two trucks were tested outdoors and a third {{was used as a}} control. Data from the testing were used to validate a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model and this model was used to predict reductions in cooling loads during daytime rest periods. The test configurations included the application of standard-equipped sleeper privacy curtain and window shades, an optional insulated or arctic sleeper curtain, and insulated window coverings. The standard curtain reduced sleeper area heating load by 21 % in one test truck, while the arctic curtain decreased it by 26 %. Insulated window coverings reduced the heating load by 16 % in the other test truck and lowered daytime solar temperature gain by 8 ˚C. The lowered temperature resulted in a predicted 34 % reduction in cooling load from the model. Modeling also predicted doubling cab insulation could reduce cooling load by 35 % and up to 54 % with the sleeper curtain closed. Infrared images of the truck cabs identified other potential areas to reduce heat loss that included areas around window and door seals, at body and structural seams, and areas where insulation may be lacking around air circulation ducts...|$|R
50|$|The GMC Astro/Chevrolet Titan are Class 8 cabover-engine (COE) trucks, sold in both {{single and}} tandem rear axle configurations. In {{contrast}} to the Crackerbox, the cab of the Astro was lengthened nearly six inches into a 54-inch BBC length with two <b>sleeper</b> <b>cab</b> configurations available. In {{what would be a}} distinguishing feature of the vehicle, the Astro/Titan was produced with a wraparound dashboard; the speedometer and tachometer were placed directly in the line of sight of the driver while most secondary gauges were placed off to the side, based on their level of use.|$|E

50|$|A large {{range of}} engines and layouts were available, {{including}} all-wheel drive models (from 1969). Later a <b>sleeper</b> <b>cab</b> was also added. The engines used are of Steyr's own manufacture, and are all diesels. These were 6.0 or 8.1 litre sixes, {{as well as}} a 12-litre V8, and were also available turbocharged. The V8, which was first shown in 1971, {{was the only one of}} the 90 range to be equipped with a tilting cabin. The 6.6 litre WD 612 engine was added in 1976. In 1969 the smaller 590/690 range was added, using a modified Hanomag-Henschel cab. This range lasted until 1982, when a smaller engined version of the 91 series replaced it.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a fashion}} {{similar to the}} Checker Marathon or Volkswagen Beetle, changes to the C-Series trucks {{throughout}} its production were very subtle. If anywhere, many of these changes were identifiable by {{the changes in the}} cowl insignias and badging. Between 1958 and 1960, the C-Series used a quad-headlight fascia. This was helpful for fire departments, which wanted to use the extra headlight bezels for emergency flashers, an option that was offered exclusively to fire, and other emergency vehicles after 1960. [...] In 1961, Ford reverted to the single headlight design; the regular C-series cab closely resembled the 1957 version. A new Super Duty model was added. Another option included a small <b>sleeper</b> <b>cab.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The cab was a re-worked {{version of}} the [...] "Ergomatic" [...] tilt cab of 1965, heavily {{modified}} with different lower panels, raised height etc., and was available in day and <b>sleeper</b> <b>cab</b> form.

The only existing engine within the Leyland empire suitable for such an application (following the demise of the ill-fated fixed-head 500 series and AEC's underdeveloped and unreliable V8) was the AEC AV760 straight-six, which was turbocharged and designated as the TL12. Other engine options included a 200 bhp Leyland L11, as well as Cummins 10- and 14-litre engines at 250 and 330 bhp, respectively.|$|E

Rear diffs were usually Meritor units, drive shafts were usually Spicer 1810 series on the main shaft and 1710 series on the jack shaft between the two diffs. Rear suspension was either Hendrickson HAS461 or NeWay. Electrical system was a 24 volt system.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} APU for a {{commercial}} truck is a small diesel engine with its own cooling system, heating system, generator or alternator system with or without inverter, and air conditioning compressor, housed in an enclosure and mounted {{to one of the}} frame rails of a semi-truck. Other designs fully integrate the auxiliary cooling, heating, and electrical components throughout the chassis of the truck. The APU generator engine is a fraction of the main engine's size and uses a fraction of the fuel; some models can run for eight hours on 1 gal of diesel. The generator also powers the main engine's block and fuel system heaters, so the main engine can be started easily right before departure if the APU is allowed to run for a period beforehand. These units are used to provide climate control and electrical power for the truck's <b>sleeper</b> <b>cab</b> and engine block heater during downtime on the road as mandated by statewide laws for idle reduction.|$|E

Trailer kits to accompany these trucks, such as box, flatbeds, refrigerated, and tankers were introduced. These kits tended to cost about $5.|$|E
5000|$|A {{choice of}} six-, nine-, or twelve-speed manual {{transmissions}} were on offer for the 2300, while the smaller 2100 received six-speed transmissions {{with or without}} synchronization. Engine options were [...] for the 2300 (with an intercooler for the more powerful model) and [...] for the 2100, {{depending on whether the}} 825 was normally aspirated or turbocharged. The 2300's cabin was mounted 40 mm higher than on the old 2200 (F218) to allow room for the intercooler plumbing, requiring extra grab handles on the door pillar. The 2300 was a considerable success in the United Kingdom, where it outsold bigger brother 2800 and made DAF a name to be reckoned with. In the early months of 1982, the DAF F2500 arrived. A fettled version of the intercooled 2300 engine provided [...] at 2400 rpm and 675 lbft Nm. The power delivery was somewhat peaky, meaning that multiple gears were a necessity. Standard fitment was the six-speed S.6-90 transmission with a splitter for twelve total gears, and a sixteen-speed [...] "Ecosplit" [...] ZF 16S112 was an available option. As with the 2300, the 2500 was available with a short or a <b>sleeper</b> <b>cab,</b> two to four axles, as tractors or as rigid trucks. The more powerful engine made it more fuel efficient than the 2300 as well as quicker and easier to drive.|$|E
40|$|Each {{intercity}} long-haul {{truck in}} the U. S. idles approximately 1, 800 hrs per year, primarily for <b>sleeper</b> <b>cab</b> hotel loads. Including workday idling, over 2 billion gallons of fuel are used annually for truck idling. NREL's CoolCab project works closely with industry to design efficient thermal management systems for long-haul trucks that keep the cab comfortable with minimized engine idling and fuel use. The impact of thermal load reduction technologies on idle reduction systems were characterized by conducting thermal soak tests, overall heat transfer tests, and 10 -hour rest period A/C tests. Technologies evaluated include advanced insulation packages, a solar reflective film applied to the vehicle's opaque exterior surfaces, a truck featuring both film and insulation, and a battery-powered A/C system. Opportunities were identified to reduce heating and cooling loads for long-haul truck idling by 36 % and 34 %, respectively, which yielded a 23 % reduction in battery pack capacity of the idle-reduction system. Data were also collected for development and validation of a CoolCalc HVAC truck cab model. CoolCalc is an easy-to-use, simplified, physics-based HVAC load estimation tool that requires no meshing, has flexible geometry, excludes unnecessary detail, and is less time-intensive than more detailed computer-aided engineering modeling approaches...|$|E
40|$|Cab climate {{conditioning}} {{is one of}} {{the primary}} reasons for operating the main engine in a long-haul truck during driver rest periods. In the United States, <b>sleeper</b> <b>cab</b> trucks use approximately 667 million gallons of fuel annually for rest period idling. The U. S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL) CoolCab Project works closely with industry to design efficient thermal management systems for long-haul trucks that minimize engine idling and fuel use while maintaining occupant comfort. Heat transfer to the vehicle interior from opaque exterior surfaces {{is one of the}} major heat pathways that contribute to air conditioning loads during long-haul truck daytime rest period idling. To quantify the impact of paint color and the opportunity for advanced paints, NREL collaborated with Volvo Group North America, PPG Industries, and Dometic Environmental Corporation. Initial screening simulations using CoolCalc, NREL's rapid HVAC load estimation tool, showed promising air-conditioning load reductions due to paint color selection. Tests conducted at NREL's Vehicle Testing and Integration Facility using long-haul truck cab sections, “test bucks, ” showed a 31. 1 % of maximum possible reduction in rise over ambient temperature and a 20. 8 % reduction in daily electric air conditioning energy use by switching from black to white paint. Additionally, changing from blue to an advanced color-matched solar reflective blue paint resulted in a 7. 3 % reduction in daily electric air conditioning energy use for weather conditions tested in Colorado. National-level modeling results using weather data from major U. S. cities indicated that the increase in heating loads due to lighter paint colors is much smaller than the reduction in cooling loads...|$|E
