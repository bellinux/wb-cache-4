50|$|A GU24 {{lamp fitting}} is a bi-pin {{connector}} for {{compact fluorescent lamps}} (CFL) or LED lamps that uses a bayonet mount-like twist-lock bi-pin connector instead of the Edison <b>screw</b> <b>fitting</b> used on many incandescent light bulbs.|$|E
50|$|On some instruments, such {{as certain}} guitars, the action can be {{adjusted}} by tightening screws at the bridge, which changes {{the height of the}} strings. Tune-o-matic bridges use small thumbwheels for this purpose; sometimes these are accompanied or replaced by flat-head <b>screw</b> <b>fitting.</b> On other instruments, changing the action is more difficult, involving the removal of entire pieces from the instrument. On a steel string acoustic guitar, for example, the action {{can be adjusted}} by carefully sanding down the guitar's saddle so that the strings sit closer to the fretboard.|$|E

50|$|A Flit gun {{consists}} of a pneumatic pump cylinder with a hand-operated piston to force air through an air nozzle in the front. Below {{the front of the}} pneumatic tube hangs a cylindrical container designed to act as a reservoir for liquid insecticide, this reservoir being set at 90 degrees to the pneumatic tube. In early versions, the reservoir is permanently secured to the pump and equipped with a removable, gasketed screw cap for filling. In later, improved versions, the insecticide reservoir is secured to the pump with a coarse <b>screw</b> <b>fitting</b> and a seal of cork composite or gasket paper, so that it can readily be unscrewed for filling. A siphon tube extends from the pump cylinder downward into the reservoir and {{the upper end of the}} siphon is positioned in front of a nozzle on the air pump. When a jet of high-velocity air exits the pump and streams across end of the siphon tube, it lowers the pressure in the siphon, drawing insecticide upward from the reservoir, which then atomizes the liquid as it is entrained in the air jet. With each vigorous forward stroke of the pump handle a burst of spray is produced, similar to that of a modern aerosol spray can.|$|E
30|$|The {{launch of}} the Osstell Mentor® in 2004 {{included}} {{the introduction of a}} less voluminous, much more user-friendly, non-cabled transducer, called Smartpeg. Smartpegs are small aluminum rods with three different parts: a coronal part with an implant system-specific <b>screw</b> <b>fitting</b> into the individual implant, a hexagon part enabling easy tightening/un-tightening, and a magnet serving as the electromagnetic puls captor. The apparatus itself was a compact device with an incorporated microcomputer and electromagnetic signal emitting and receiving tipped probe. Excitation of the implant-mounted Smartpeg is performed by four electromagnetic pulses with different frequencies inducing Smartpeg vibration in mostly two directions perpendicular to each other. The vibration directions correspond to a low and a high resonance frequency. The manufacturer recommends performing at least two measurements, in order to identify these possible different stabilities. Furthermore, in order to suppress electromagnetic environmental noise, the working principle is refined by four times repeated emission of each excitation frequency. In summary, 16 pulses are emitted for each single measurement. The captured outcome of each in fourfold emitted signal is converted by the built-in microcomputer into a frequency spectrum by a “fast Fourier transformation” (FFT) method, ending up to detect among the four calculated spectra the two highest peaks representing the resonance frequencies of the implant. The latter will be used to calculate the so-called implant stability quotients (ISQ) by aid of a mathematical algorithm. ISQ is a unitless number, ranging between 0 and 100. If {{the difference between the two}} peaks is less than 3 ISQ units, or in case of only one peak detection, only 1 ISQ value will be displayed by the microcomputer. The 2009 Osstell ISQ version and the present Osstell IDx® version do make use of the same algorithm.|$|E

30|$|The phantom {{was printed}} using a Connex 3 PolyJet printer (Stratasys Ltd., Eden Prairie, MN, USA). A 16 -μm layer of liquid ultraviolet-curable {{photopolymer}} is printed onto the build tray. An ultraviolet laser then cures the resin solidifying the pattern traced on the tray. This process is then repeated for each layer. Where overhangs or domed shapes are required, a removable support material is {{printed on the}} under layers to prevent the structure collapsing before curing. Various photopolymer resins are available for printing; in this case, a white opaque resin was chosen for the main phantom body (VeroWhite Plus FullCure 835). A black rubber-like material (TangoBlack Plus FullCure 980 Shore 27 a) was printed alongside the main phantom material to create gaskets to seal the phantom around the base and <b>screw</b> <b>fittings.</b> Lesion inserts were printed using a transparent polymer, (VeroClear FullCure 810) to enable liquid level to be observed during filling.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{solution}} of the problem, relating to the reinforcement shear and matrix of the composite {{is associated with the}} problem of its mechanical resistance, strength and stability. The interest to the spiral reinforcement is determined by using of its geometric peculiarities in order to minimize as regards to the shear in the loaded composite. We present a model problem of bending of a cylindrical rod with a screw armature. It is shown that the length step of the spiral reinforcement and the axial length of the deformation zone of the rod determine the critical shears values: in case of the multiplicity of the length of the deformation zone and the propeller pitch the shears in the end sections of the deformation zone are absent. We also show that there exists a critical length of the deformation zone, for which the maximum shears are realized. The problem is generalized for the case of armoring by a finite family of left-hand <b>screw</b> <b>fittings.</b> The results of work are used in designing of special aseismic composite supports, as well as structural design of electrical and optical cables...|$|R
25|$|From the {{inception}} of the design, priority was given to easy access to the powerplant, fuselage weapons and other systems while the aircraft was operating from forward airfields. To this end, the entire engine cowling was made up of large, easily removable panels which were secured by large toggle latches. A large panel under the wing centre section could be removed {{to gain access to the}} L-shaped main fuel tank, which was sited partly under the cockpit floor and partly behind the rear cockpit bulkhead. Other, smaller panels gave easy access to the cooling system and electrical equipment. The engine was held in two large, forged, Elektron magnesium alloy Y-shaped legs, one per side straddling the engine block, which were cantilevered from the firewall. Each of the legs was secured by two quick-release <b>screw</b> <b>fittings</b> on the firewall. All of the main pipe connections were colour-coded and grouped in one place, where possible, and electrical equipment plugged into junction boxes mounted on the firewall. The entire powerplant could be removed or replaced as a unit in a matter of minutes, a potential step to the eventual adoption of the unitized-powerplant Kraftei engine mounting concept used by many German combat aircraft designs, later in the war years.|$|R
50|$|Food {{extrusion}} {{is a form}} of extrusion used in food processing. It is {{a process}} by which a set of mixed ingredients are forced through an opening in a perforated plate or die with a design specific to the food, and is then cut to a specified size by blades. The machine which forces the mix through the die is an extruder, and the mix is known as the extrudate. The extruder consists of a large, rotating <b>screw</b> tightly <b>fitting</b> within a stationary barrel, {{at the end of which}} is the die.|$|R
50|$|Other {{advantages}} of using structural pipe fittings are easy installation and reconfigurable design. Since {{there are no}} permanent welds in the structure, the set <b>screws</b> of the <b>fittings</b> can simply be loosened, allowing them to be repositioned. The project can be disassembled and stored if needed, or even taken apart with fittings and pipe recycled into a new project.|$|R
50|$|In the {{extrusion}} process, {{raw materials}} are first {{ground to the}} correct particle size, usually the consistency of coarse flour. The dry mix is passed through a pre-conditioner, in which other ingredients are added depending on the target product; these may be liquid sugar, fats, dyes, meats or water. Steam is injected to start the cooking process, and the preconditioned mix (extrudate) is then passed through an extruder. The extruder consists of a large, rotating <b>screw</b> tightly <b>fitting</b> within a stationary barrel, {{at the end of}} which is the die. The extruder's rotating screw forces the extrudate toward the die, through which it then passes. The amount of time the extrudate is in the extruder is the residence time.|$|R

40|$|In recent years, plate osteosynthesis with angular stable {{implants}} {{is frequently}} used for severely displaced three- and four-part proximal humeral fractures. The {{aim of this}} study is to evaluate early results of these fractures treated with insertion of LCP or Philos plates. We present results in 30 cases of proximal humeral fractures, 17 with 3 parts according to Neer and 13 with 4 parts, treated with Locking Compression Plates (LCP, 14 cases) and Philos plates (16) by the deltopectoral approach. Patients were checked with standard X-rays and clinical evaluation, according to the Constant-Murley shoulder score, Individual Constant score and Relative Constant score. Mean follow-up time was 21 months (range 6 - 42 months). The mean Constant-Murley shoulder scores were Pain 10. 6 (3 - 15), Activities of Daily Living 15. 3 (2 - 20), Range of Motion 26. 8 (12 - 40) and Power 10. 3 (3 - 25) and Total 63 (25 - 97). The Individual Constant score was 68. 6 % (27 - 98 %) and the Relative Constant score 85. 4 % (36 - 130 %). Fractures in 3 parts (of the surgical or anatomic humeral neck and major tubercle) had a mean Constant score of 69. 1 (17 cases), but this fell to 55 (13 cases) in those in 4 parts (neck, major and lesser tubercles). Late necrosis of the humeral head occurred in two cases, both with 4 -part breaks. We thus believe that 3 -part fractures, in which both reduction and stable osteosynthesis are easier, show favourable prognosis and should be clearly distinguished from 4 -part ones during assessments. The deltopectoral approach offers good exposure and is especially recommended in 4 -part fractures, also because it provides a good view of the lesser tubercle. The osteosynthesis must be stable if early mobilisation of the shoulder and proper recovery of range of motion are to be achieved. As well as reduction and stabilisation of the tubercles, it is also important to restore the neck/shaft angle and stabilise it with oblique <b>screws</b> <b>fitting</b> the plate to avoid varus malposition...|$|R

50|$|However, {{as there}} was no {{standardization}} of these mounting locations, designing a binding that worked with any boot was difficult. Worse, on leather boots the mounting point would change as the leather wore down, or even due to flexing during the day. One {{solution to this problem}} was to use small metal <b>fittings</b> <b>screwed</b> into the boot, to provide a known and unchanging mounting point for the bindings. Solutions like these were features of the first safety bindings, the Hanson Ski Binding and Cubco, while popular designs of the 1970s used metal plates that extended along the entire sole of the boot. The bindings clipped onto these plates instead of the boot proper, providing a much more reliable release.|$|R
