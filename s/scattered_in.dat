40|$|We {{measure the}} width of the MgII λ 2799 line in quasar spectra from the SDSS, 2 QZ and 2 SLAQ surveys and, by invoking an unnormalised virial mass estimator, relate the <b>scatter</b> <b>in</b> line width to the <b>scatter</b> <b>in</b> mass in the {{underlying}} black hole population. We find conclusive evidence for a trend such that there is less <b>scatter</b> <b>in</b> line width, and hence black hole mass, in more luminous objects. However, the most luminous objects in our sample show such a low degree of <b>scatter</b> <b>in</b> line width that, when combined with measures for the intrinsic <b>scatter</b> <b>in</b> the radius-luminosity relation for the broad-line region in active galaxies, an inconsistency arises in the virial technique for estimating black hole masses. This analysis implies that, at least for the most luminous quasars, either there is little-to-no intrinsic <b>scatter</b> <b>in</b> the radius-luminosity relation or the MgII broad emission line region is not totally dominated by virial velocities.

40|$|We {{present a}} simple toy model to {{understand}} what sets the <b>scatter</b> <b>in</b> star formation and metallicity of galaxies at fixed mass. The scatter ultimately arises from the intrinsic <b>scatter</b> <b>in</b> the accretion rate, but may be substantially reduced depending on the timescale on which the accretion varies compared to the timescale on which the galaxy loses gas mass. This model naturally produces an anti-correlation between star formation and metallicity at a fixed mass, {{the basis of the}} fundamental metallicity relation. We show that observational constraints on the <b>scatter</b> <b>in</b> galaxy scaling relations can be translated into constraints on the galaxy-to-galaxy variation in the mass loading factor, and the timescales and magnitude of stochastic accretion onto star-forming galaxies. We find a remarkably small <b>scatter</b> <b>in</b> the mass loading factor, < 0. 1 dex, and that the <b>scatter</b> <b>in</b> accretion rates is smaller than expected from N-body simulations.

40|$|In this work, we {{test the}} {{assertion}} that the <b>scatter</b> <b>in</b> the mass of black holes which drive quasars should be luminosity dependent with less <b>scatter</b> <b>in</b> more luminous objects. To this end, we measure {{the width of the}} Mg iiλ 2799 line in quasar spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), 2 df QSO Redshift survey (2 QZ) and 2 dF SDSS LRG And QSO (2 SLAQ) surveys and, by invoking an unnormalized virial mass estimator, relate the <b>scatter</b> <b>in</b> linewidth to the <b>scatter</b> of mass <b>in</b> the underlying black hole population. We find conclusive evidence for a trend such that there is less <b>scatter</b> <b>in</b> linewidth, and hence black hole mass, in more luminous objects. However, the most luminous objects in our sample show such a low degree of <b>scatter</b> <b>in</b> linewidth that, when combined with measures for the intrinsic <b>scatter</b> <b>in</b> the radius–luminosity relation for the broad-line region (BLR) in active galaxies, an inconsistency arises in the virial technique for estimating black hole masses. This analysis implies that, at least for the most luminous quasars, either there is little-to-no intrinsic <b>scatter</b> <b>in</b> the radius–luminosity relation or the Mg ii broad emission-line region is not totally dominated by virial velocities. Finally, we exploit the measured <b>scatter</b> <b>in</b> linewidths to constrain models for the velocity field of the BLR. We show that the lack of <b>scatter</b> <b>in</b> broad-line widths for luminous quasars is inconsistent with a pure planar/disc-like geometry for the BLR. In the case of a BLR with purely polar flows, the opening angle to luminous quasars must be less than ∼ 55 °. We then explore the effects of adding a random or spherically symmetric component to the velocities of gas clouds in the BLR. Assuming an opening angle to quasars of 45 °, a planar field can be made consistent with our results if ∼ 40 – 50 per cent of the velocities are randomly distributed...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} and numerical study into the intrinsic <b>scatter</b> <b>in</b> the fire structural resistance of aluminium plate supporting tension loads is presented. Small-scale simulated fire structural tests performed on two aluminium alloys (AA 5083 and AA 6061) {{show for the}} first time a large amount of <b>scatter</b> <b>in</b> the tensile deformation rate and rupture stress. Multiple simulated fire tests conducted under identical heat flux exposure and tensile load conditions reveal <b>scatter</b> <b>in</b> the softening behaviour of the two aluminium alloys; there is large variability in the deformation rate, rupture stress and time-to-rupture, particularly at low stresses when creep dominates the softening process. Finite element analysis (incorporating elastic, plastic and creep softening effects) and elevated temperature material testing reveals that the scatter is caused mainly by variability in creep properties such as creep activation energy. A probability density function is used to quantify the <b>scatter</b> <b>in</b> the creep activation energy, and the finite element model using Monte Carlo simulations computes the <b>scatter</b> <b>in</b> the fire structural resistance of aluminium, which is not possible with existing deterministic models...|$|R

This is in contrast to a popular belief that <b>scattering</b> <b>in</b> the source end of a nanotransistor is significantly more detrimental to the drive current than scattering elsewhere. As the channel length becomes much larger than the <b>scattering</b> length, <b>scattering</b> <b>in</b> the drain-end is less detrimental to the drive current than scattering near the source-end of the channel.
