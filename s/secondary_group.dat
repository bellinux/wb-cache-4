25|$|The first {{drawings}} {{appearing in}} the Côa Valley date between 22-20,000 years B.C., consisting of zoomorphic imagery of nature. Between 20-18,000 B.C. (Solutense period), a <b>secondary</b> <b>group</b> of animal drawings included examples of muzzled horses. There was greater elaboration during 16-10,000 years B.C. (Magdalenense period), with a Paleolithic style. The essentially anthropomorphic and zoomorphic designs included horses identifiable by their characteristic manes, aurochs with mouths and nostrils indicated, and deer.|$|E
25|$|Patrol craft were {{designed}} primarily for anti-submarine warfare and mine sweeping and the armament reflected this. A <b>secondary</b> <b>group</b> of arms were anti-aircraft.

25|$|From its {{inception}} until the 2001–02 season, the teams were grouped geographically into {{four or five}} zones – North, West, East, and South, with Central added in 1952–53. Initial matches were played within the zones on a knock-out basis until 1956–57, and thereafter on a league basis, to determine a winner; then, the five individual zone winners competed in a knock-out tournament, leading to a final which decided {{the winner of the}} Ranji Trophy. From the 1970–71 season, the knock-out stage was expanded to the top two teams from each zone, a total of ten qualifying teams. This was expanded again to the top three from each zone in 1992–93, a total of fifteen qualifying teams; between 1996–97 and 1999–2000, the fifteen qualifying teams competed in a <b>secondary</b> <b>group</b> stage, with three groups of five teams, and the top two from each group qualified for a six-team knock-out stage; in all other years until 2001–02, a full fifteen-team knock-out tournament was held.|$|E
50|$|<b>Secondary</b> <b>groups,</b> in {{contrast}} to primary groups, are large groups involving formal and institutional relationships.

50|$|In {{contrast}} to the casual variant the formal theory {{is not based on}} any instincts of human beings. The focus of the formal variant lies on the “evolution of modern, industrial societies”. This evolution starts with family and other kinship groups which form the majority of groups under primitive circumstances. As society evolves <b>secondary</b> <b>groups</b> emerge which gradually absorb the social functions that had been provided by the kinship- and family-type units. Often these new groups reach a higher rate of interaction and importance than the primary groups. Examples for those <b>secondary</b> <b>groups</b> would be labor unions, large companies, states, churches or universities.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Rising {{magnetic}} flux loops {{in the solar}} convection zone develop an asymmetric shape with a flat preceding part and a steeper following part {{with respect to the}} direction of solar rotation. By a statistical analysis of newly forming sunspot groups we test the conjecture that this geometrical asymmetry leads to an asymmetric distribution of <b>secondary</b> spot <b>groups</b> originating from the legs of the same rising flux loop as the primary group, which develops out of the loop summit. We find that ∼ 10 % of all sunspot <b>groups</b> actually develop <b>secondary</b> <b>groups</b> within ± 20 ◦ longitude distance from the primary group and within one day after its emergence. Those <b>secondary</b> <b>groups</b> related to small primary groups (area < 100 millionths of the solar hemisphere) are predominantly located on their eastern (following) side, while for larger primary <b>groups</b> the <b>secondaries</b> are more numerous on their western (preceding) side.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the pattern of}} bone secondaries in prostatic carcinoma patients using Technitium 99 m Methyl Diphosphate (TC 99 m MDP) imaging technique. Design: Retrospective study. Setting: Ziauddin Hospital, Karachi from 1998 to 2004. Methods: The study included 135 subjects, which were divided into four groups according to age.

40|$|Starting from bis-MPA, PEGePLLA triblock {{copolymers}} (bis-MPA-(PLLAePEG) 2), comprising {{a central}} Nhydroxysuccinimide active ester, were synthesized. Reacting the corresponding active ester with a,udiamines afforded four-armed (PEGePLLA) 2 eRe(PLLAePEG) 2 copolymers with central a,u-diamide groups (R). Applying the a,u-diamines, hexamethylene-diamine, spermine or norspermidine none, {{one or two}} <b>secondary</b> amine <b>groups,</b> respectively, were introduced into the linking moiety R. Whereas a copolymer containing no <b>secondary</b> amine <b>groups</b> showed fully thermo-reversible gelation behavior, copolymers comprising a central moiety containing one or two <b>secondary</b> amine <b>groups</b> retained the ‘sol’ state after a few heating and cooling cycles. Dynamic light scattering revealed that the copolymer containing no <b>secondary</b> amine <b>groups</b> showed a thermo-reversible shift in micellar size and small aggregates (57 and 877 nm at 25 C and 40 and 152 nm at 50 C). Conversely, copolymers comprising a central moiety containing <b>secondary</b> amine <b>groups</b> show a temperature independent distribution mainly consisting of micelles. It is proposed that the protonated amine groups preferably are located at the corona of the micelles and micellar aggregates and/or shielded by the PEG blocks, hindering the formation of hydrogels by PEG entanglements upon a change in temperature...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{kinetics}} of {{the reactions}} of the primary and <b>secondary</b> amine <b>groups</b> in aqueous DETA solution were measured {{in a string of}} discs contactor at different concentrations and temperatures.

The reaction rates increase with increasing DETA concentration and temperature. The reaction order is found to be a broken-order and to vary slightly with the temperature. Both the termolecular and the zwitterion mechanisms were applied to interpret the experimental data and gave identical result. Both DETA and water contribute to the carbamate formation in the primary and <b>secondary</b> amine <b>groups.</b> The rate of CO 2 absorbed in the primary amine group is faster than the <b>secondary</b> amine <b>group</b> and about 100 times higher...|$|R
