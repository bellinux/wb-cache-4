5|$|Thatcher's {{economic}} policy {{was influenced by}} monetarist thinking and economists such as Milton Friedman and Alan Walters. Together with Chancellor of the Exchequer Geoffrey Howe, <b>she</b> <b>lowered</b> direct taxes on income and increased indirect taxes. She increased interest rates to slow {{the growth of the}} money supply and thereby lower inflation, introduced cash limits on public spending, and reduced expenditure on social services such as education and housing. Cuts to higher education resulted in her becoming the first Oxford-educated post-war Prime Minister without an honorary doctorate from Oxford University, after a 738–319 vote of the governing assembly and a student petition.|$|E

25|$|The British came up {{and found}} her to be Princesa, {{carrying}} 64 guns and a crew of 650 {{under the command of}} Don Parlo Augustino de Gera. They began to chase her at 10am, upon which <b>she</b> <b>lowered</b> the French colours she had been flying and hoisted Spanish ones. Mayne addressed his men saying 'When you received the pay of your country, you engaged yourselves to stand all dangers in her cause. Now is the trial; fight like men for you have no hope but in your courage.' After a two and half hour chase the British were able to come alongside and exchange broadsides, which eventually left the Spanish ship disabled. The British then raked her until she struck her colours. The Spanish ship had casualties of 33 killed and around 100 wounded, while eight men were killed aboard both Kent and Orford, and another one aboard Lenox. Total British wounded amounted to 40, and included Captain Durell of Kent, who had one of his hands shot away. The commander of Orford during the engagement had been Lord Augustus FitzRoy.|$|E

For the scene in which Amy is dragged underneath the ground, Gillan stood on boxes and lowered herself into a stone compartment. Two pieces of rubber were {{at the opening of}} the compartment which expanded as <b>she</b> <b>lowered</b> herself down. A layer of soil was spread across the rubber; Gillan's ears were taped over to make sure the soil did not enter her ears. Gillan, initially scared at performing the stunt, put some of her fear and claustrophobia into the scene as she expected Amy felt the same way.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, the sequel, Godchild, {{received}} positive reviews. When {{the first}} chapter premiered in Shojo Beat, critics commented on the potiental and art of the series, but found the chapter [...] "listless" [...] and confusing. Reviews of the bound volumes were positive. Writing for The Book Report, Robin Brenner described the mysteries as [...] "unsettling, splatter-filled, and deliciously {{in line with the}} melodramatic, horrific traditions of Edgar Allan Poe and Mary Shelley." [...] Leroy Douresseaux of Coolstreak Cartoons wrote: [...] "By turns bizarre and unsettling, Godchild is actually quite engaging, but can be difficult to follow for those who didn't come in at the beginning". Writing for Sequential Tart, Sheena McNeil described Godchild as [...] "a masterpiece {{in every sense of the}} word." [...] In reviews of subsequent volumes, <b>she</b> <b>lowered</b> her score, and praised Yuki's characterization, mysteries, and artwork; she concluded: [...] "Godchild is a fantastic and different story that can't be denied." ...|$|E
