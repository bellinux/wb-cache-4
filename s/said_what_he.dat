500|$|After an {{instrumental}} introduction, {{there are two}} verses, followed by a guitar solo, which {{has been described as}} [...] "richly melodic" [...] by biographer Keith Shadwick. [...] Shapiro noted the song's brevity: [...] "The song fades on a magical solo after only two minutes and twenty-five seconds. Even live, 'Little Wing' was hardly any longer – he <b>said</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wanted to say and stopped".|$|E
500|$|Mateiu Caragiale's {{personal}} life has for long attracted {{interest for the}} traces it left in his literary work. This is enhanced by his reputation for being a secretive man. In a late interview, Cella Delavrancea described him as [...] "made up of [...] small patches, so well sewn together that one never knew what he had <b>said,</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had meant to say, what he is thinking." [...] While Ionel Gherea suspected that Caragiale was merely acting, Eugen Lovinescu, who described Caragiale's personality as [...] "bizarre", also referred to him as [...] "colorful and sterile." [...] Despite his hectic lifestyle, Caragiale feared poverty and lashed out at Bohemianism, stressing that [...] "it kills, and many times not just figuratively". In tandem, fragments of his writings and private records are thought by cultural historian Andrei Oișteanu to show intimate familiarity with substance abuse and the drug subculture of his age, {{in addition to his}} self admitted binge drinking. During his final years of life, he was harvesting an unspecified wild herb from the hills of Cotroceni neighborhood, and using it as a sedative. By then, essayist Ion Vartic notes, Caragiale's obsession with death had developed into [...] "neurosis".|$|E
500|$|Paleoconservative {{activist and}} former presidential {{candidate}} Pat Buchanan has appeared twice as of 2011. In a June 2008 interview initiated and arranged by his publicist, he promoted his book Churchill, Hitler and the Unnecessary War. During the broadcast, Buchanan defended Charles Lindbergh against charges of antisemitism, stating that his reputation [...] "has been blackened because of a single speech he gave {{and a couple of}} paragraphs in it where he said that... the Jewish community is beating the drums for warbut frankly, no one has <b>said</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> said was palpably untrue." [...] At the end of the interview, James Edwards said, [...] "Mr. Buchanan, {{thank you so much for}} coming back on our program, for fighting for our people." [...] Previously, in September 2006, Buchanan had made an appearance to promote his book State of Emergency; during this interview, he said that [...] "we are being invaded by people of different cultures" [...] and argued that Americans [...] "cannot survive a bifurcated culture or a heavily Hispanicized culture, tilted towards Mexico... I think that's the beginning of the end of the United States." ...|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, {{the female}} protagonists {{challenge}} their male [...] "suitors" [...] {{to keep up}} instead of being full of empty promises; the women further feel that [...] "He's not fulfilling you like he says". Williams further explained {{the meaning of the}} song during an interview with MTV News, [...] "We've had experiences with men doing a lot of talking but they can’t back it up. You said you could do this, but you can't, whether that's on the dance floor or wherever else. He <b>said</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> could do for you, but..." [...] The lyrics are constructed in the chorus-verse pattern. The song opens with the lines [...] "Hit me" [...] and the first verses sung by Beyoncé follow: [...] "I put it right there made it easy for you to get to / Now you want to act like you don't know what to do". The chorus follows during which the group repeatedly sings the lines [...] "Can you keep up?". Rowland's second verses follow where she sings the lines [...] "Put it on me deep in the right direction". The chorus is repeated twice before the bridge by Williams. After the bridge, the group sings the lines [...] "Here's your papers, baby you are dismissed" [...] letting their man know that he is not good enough for them. Rowland sings a short ad lib, and then the trio ends with a repeated chorus. Nick Reynolds from BBC compared the song Missy Elliott's [...] "Pass That Dutch" [...] and to songs by The Supremes. He further found a name check of Public Enemy's [...] "Bring the Noise". Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine also compared [...] "Lose My Breath with [...] "Pass That Dutch".|$|E

2500|$|Polk biographers {{over the}} years have sized up the {{magnitude}} of Polk's achievements and his legacy, particularly his two most recent. [...] "There are three key reasons why James K. Polk deserves recognition as a significant and influential American president," [...] Walter Borneman wrote. [...] "First, Polk accomplished the objectives of his presidential term as he defined them; second, he was the most decisive chief executive before the Civil War; and third, he greatly expanded the executive power of the presidency, particularly its war powers, its role as commander-in-chief, and its oversight of the executive branch." [...] President Harry S. Truman summarized this view by saying that Polk was [...] "a great president. <b>Said</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> intended to do and did it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Creedence Clearwater Revival was {{inducted}} into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993. Fogerty refused to perform with his former bandmates and fellow inductees Stu Cook and Doug Clifford during the musical portion of the induction ceremony. In place of the surviving members of CCR, Fogerty recruited session musicians on drums and bass and was also joined by Bruce Springsteen and Robbie Robertson in performing three songs: [...] "Who'll Stop the Rain", [...] "Born on the Bayou" [...] and [...] "Green River". During the induction speech, Springsteen said, [...] "As a songwriter, only a few did as much in three minutes [...] He was an Old Testament, shaggy-haired prophet, a fatalist. [...] Funny, too. [...] He was severe, he was precise, he <b>said</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had to say and he got out of there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some right-wing {{members of}} Netanyahu's {{governing}} coalition criticized his remarks {{for the creation}} of a Palestinian State; believing that all of the land should become under Israeli sovereignty. Likud MK Danny Danon said that Netanyahu went [...] "against the Likud platform", while MK Uri Orbach of Habayit Hayehudi said that it had [...] "dangerous implications". Opposition party Kadima leader Tzipi Livni remarked after the address that she thinks Netanyahu does not really believe in the two-state solution at all; she thought that he only <b>said</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> did as a feigned response to international pressure. Peace Now criticized the speech, highlighting that, in the group's opinion, it did not address the Palestinians as equal partners in the peace process. The Secretary General of Peace Now, Yariv Oppenheimer, said, [...] "It's a rerun of Netanyahu from his first term".|$|E
2500|$|The State alleged, however, {{that several}} things {{were done in}} return. A former {{business}} associate of Shaik, Professor Themba Sono, told the court that Shaik told business partners that the Nkobi group could bring [...] "political connectivity" [...] to the table. Shaik <b>said</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> meant by political connectivity was Black Economic Empowerment (BEE). Professor John Lennon of Caledonian University in Glasgow told the court that Zuma advised him to use Nkobi as the South African partner for a proposed eco-tourism school. When Lennon seemed hesitant, Shaik threatened to derail the proposal and tell Zuma. A feasibility study for the project was cancelled after {{the government of the}} United Kingdom refused an application for funding. Shaik denied that he {{had anything to do with}} the sudden decline of the project. He said that his [...] "unfortunate" [...] correspondence with Lennon was prompted by his reaction to being [...] "sidelined." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bush was {{initially}} {{opposed to a}} potential presidential bid for her son Jeb Bush, believing that other families should have a try at the presidency and that [...] "we've had enough Bushes." [...] However, she reversed her position and appeared in a campaign ad for him. Beginning in February 2016, she was reported to begin campaigning for him in New Hampshire, an early voting state. Jeb Bush joked that {{a town hall meeting}} attended by his mother featured a larger gathering than town halls prior to her involvement. Concerning her son, she believes Jeb is nearly too well-mannered, but also is confident that he is [...] "decent and honest, and everything we need in a president." [...] Bush weighed in on Jeb's rival for the nomination, Donald Trump, by her own admission not understanding how women [...] "can vote for someone who <b>said</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> said about Megyn Kelly". She also indicated that she had tired of Trump {{over the course of the}} campaign and due to her gender, she was [...] "not crazy about what he says about women." [...] During the CBS Republican debate in February 2016, Jeb defended his mother by saying she [...] "is the strongest woman I know", to which Trump replied that Barbara Bush [...] "should be running." ...|$|E

[...] He praised Sanders in May 2016, stating: [...] "He's <b>said</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> done and he'd done <b>what</b> <b>he</b> says in the Senate.
