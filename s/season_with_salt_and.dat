25|$|In {{the late}} 14th century, {{the first known}} waffle recipe was penned in an {{anonymous}} manuscript, Le Ménagier de Paris, written by a husband {{as a set of}} instructions to his young wife. While it technically contains four recipes, all are a variation of the first: Beat some eggs in a bowl, <b>season</b> <b>with</b> <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> add wine. Toss in some flour, and mix. Then fill, little by little, two irons at a time with as much of the paste as a slice of cheese is large. Then close the iron and cook both sides. If the dough does not detach easily from the iron, coat it first with a piece of cloth that has been soaked in oil or grease. The other three variations explain how cheese is to be placed in between two layers of batter, grated and mixed in to the batter, or left out, along with the eggs. However, this was a waffle / gaufre in name only, as the recipe contained no leavening.|$|E
