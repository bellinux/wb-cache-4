The income typically consists of interest, dividends, and <b>securities</b> <b>lending</b> <b>fees.</b> This contrasts with the price return, which takes into account only the capital gain on an investment.

However, <b>securities</b> <b>lending</b> can also present a number of challenges to plan participants and plan sponsors.

In this testimony, GAO discusses its recent work regarding <b>securities</b> <b>lending</b> with cash collateral reinvestment.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} uses a Sociological {{approach to}} analyse {{the risks associated}} with the practice of <b>securities</b> <b>lending.</b> Risks are those factors that inhibit the development of trust, and trust is essential for people to participate in financial transactions like <b>securities</b> <b>lending.</b> In this dissertation we show that, although {{there are a number of}} risks, individual and systemic, that are associated with <b>securities</b> <b>lending,</b> practitioners have, over time, developed an array of risk management procedures and practices to keep these risks at acceptable levels. <b>Securities</b> <b>lending</b> is however not practiced in a vacuum and the relevance of these risk management procedures is largely determined by the cultural environment in which it is practised. Values, norms and sanctions are crucial as social controls over behaviour that transpires in social structures. The presence of structural conditions necessary for the development of a culture of extreme opportunism is shown as arguably the greatest source of risk facing those who participate in financial transactions like <b>securities</b> <b>lending.</b> SociologyM.

This positive relation is stronger for stocks with lower short interest, higher arbitrage risk, and higher information uncertainty. Our results are robust to using alternative measures of price crash risk and equity lending market condition. Overall, our findings indicate that higher short-sale costs and risks result in higher stock price crash risk due to the accumulation of negative information...|$|R

The voluntary pilot collection included end-of-day loan-level data for three non-consecutive business days from seven <b>securities</b> <b>lending</b> agents.

The dataset of 75 reporting fields provides substantial new information about <b>securities</b> <b>lending</b> activity, including information concerning securities owners, securities borrowers, attributes of securities loans, collateral management, and cash reinvestment practices.

40|$|<b>Securities</b> <b>lending</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in supporting financial markets. For example, it can improve market liquidity, potentially reducing the cost of trading and increasing market efficiency. But by increasing the interconnections between institutions it can pose potential risks to financial stability, which are exacerbated by a lack of transparency in the <b>securities</b> <b>lending</b> market. Since the onset of the financial crisis, market participants have attempted to address some of these risks, and fundamental changes to market infrastructure are being discussed, such as the use of central counterparties. New regulations under way to improve the resilience of the financial system may also impact both the risks to financial stability from <b>securities</b> <b>lending</b> and its benefits. ...|$|R
