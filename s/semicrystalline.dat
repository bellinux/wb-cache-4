Some thermoplastics may be fully amorphous, while others have a partially crystalline/partially amorphous structure. Both amorphous and <b>semicrystalline</b> thermoplastics have a glass transition, above which welding can occur, but semicrystallines also have a specific melting point which is above the glass transition. Above this melting point, the viscous liquid will become a free-flowing liquid (see rheological weldability for thermoplastics). Examples of thermoplastics include polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinylchloride (PVC), and fluoroplastics like Teflon and Spectralon.|$|E

In the plant embryo {{and in the absence}} of light, proplastids develop into etioplasts that contain <b>semicrystalline</b> membrane structures called prolamellar bodies. When exposed to light, these prolamellar bodies develop into thylakoids. This does not happen in seedlings grown in the dark, which undergo etiolation. An underexposure to light can cause the thylakoids to fail. This causes the chloroplasts to fail resulting in the death of the plant.|$|E

2500|$|A polymer ( [...] ; Greek , [...] "many" [...] + , [...] "parts") {{is a large}} molecule, or macromolecule, {{composed}} of many repeated subunits. Because of their broad range of properties, both synthetic and natural polymers play essential and ubiquitous roles in everyday life. Polymers range from familiar synthetic plastics such as polystyrene to natural biopolymers such as DNA and proteins that are fundamental to biological structure and function. Polymers, both natural and synthetic, are created via polymerization of many small molecules, known as monomers. Their consequently large molecular mass relative to small molecule compounds produces unique physical properties, including toughness, viscoelasticity, and a tendency to form glasses and <b>semicrystalline</b> structures rather than crystals.|$|E
2500|$|SAMs {{are created}} by the {{chemisorption}} of [...] "head groups" [...] onto a substrate from either the vapor or liquid phase followed by a slow organization of [...] "tail groups".

The [...] "head groups" [...] assemble together on the substrate, while the tail groups assemble far from the substrate. Areas of close-packed molecules nucleate and grow until the surface of the substrate is covered in a single monolayer.|$|E

50|$|Relatively strong intermolecular {{forces in}} <b>semicrystalline</b> {{polymers}} prevent softening even above the glass transition temperature. Their elastic modulus changes significantly only at high (melting) temperature. It {{also depends on}} the degree of crystallinity: higher crystallinity results in a harder and more thermally stable, but also more brittle material, whereas the amorphous regions provide certain elasticity and impact resistance. Another characteristic feature of <b>semicrystalline</b> polymers is strong anisotropy of their mechanical properties along the direction of molecular alignment and perpendicular to it.|$|E

English {{from the}} DuPont Corporation, {{was awarded the}} status of Fellow in the American Physical Society, after they were {{nominated}} by their Division of Polymer Physics in 1989, for contributions {{to the development of}} a description of polymer segmental dynamics from solid-state NMR data, which incorporates the variability of both spatial and temporal coordinates with temperature and is applicable to both <b>semicrystalline</b> and amorphous polymers.|$|E
50|$|Some {{examples}} of viscoelastic materials include amorphous polymers, <b>semicrystalline</b> polymers, biopolymers, metals {{at very high}} temperatures, and bitumen materials. Cracking occurs when the strain is applied quickly {{and outside of the}} elastic limit. Ligaments and tendons are viscoelastic, so the extent of the potential damage to them depends both on the rate of the change of their length {{as well as on the}} force applied.|$|E
5000|$|The glass-liquid {{transition}} {{or glass}} transition for short is the reversible transition in amorphous materials (or in amorphous regions within <b>semicrystalline</b> materials) from a hard and relatively brittle [...] "glassy" [...] state into a viscous or rubbery state {{as the temperature}} is increased. An amorphous solid that exhibits a glass transition is called a glass. The reverse transition, achieved by supercooling a viscous liquid into the glass state, is called vitrification.|$|E

5000|$|The glass {{transition}} temperature of PPA increases {{as the amount of}} TPA increases. If more than 55% of the acid part of a PPA is made out of IPA, then the copolymer is amorphous. [...] The properties of <b>semicrystalline</b> polymers v amorphous polymers are described elsewhere in detail. Briefly, crystallinity helps with chemical resistance and mechanical properties above the {{glass transition}} temperature (but below the melting point). Amorphous polymers are good in warpage and transparency.|$|E
5000|$|Chitosan is a deacetylated {{derivative}} of chitin. When the acetylized {{composition of the}} copolymer is below 50% it is chitosan. Chitosan is a <b>semicrystalline</b> “polymer of β-(1-4)-2-amino-2-deoxy-D-glucose”. [...] One difference between chitin and chitosan is that chitosan is soluble in acidic aqueous solutions. Chitosan is easier to process that chitin, but it is less stable {{because it is more}} hydrophilic and has pH sensitivity. Due to its ease of processing, chitosan is used in biomedical applications.|$|E

50|$|To use {{cellulose}} as an example, <b>semicrystalline</b> microfibrils are sheared in the amorphous region, {{resulting in}} microcrystalline cellulose (MCC). These small, crystalline cellulose fibrils {{are at this}} points reclassified as a whisker and can be 2 to 20nm in diameter with shapes ranging from spherical to cylindrical.

The matrix of these composites are commonly hydrophobic synthetic polymers such as polyethylene, and polyvinyl chloride and copolymers of polystyrene and polyacrylate.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the table}} below, the range for α is from 10−7 K−1 for hard solids to 10−3 K−1 for organic liquids. The {{coefficient}} α {{varies with the}} temperature and some materials {{have a very high}} variation see for example the variation vs. temperature of the volumetric coefficient for a <b>semicrystalline</b> polypropylene (PP) at different pressure, and the variation of the linear coefficient vs. temperature for some steel grades (from bottom to top: ferritic stainless steel, martensitic stainless steel, carbon steel, duplex stainless steel, austenitic steel).|$|E
50|$|Growth {{from the}} melt {{would follow the}} {{temperature}} gradient (see figure). For example, if the gradient is directed normal to the direction of molecular alignment then the lamella growth sideward into a planar crystallite. However, in absence of thermal gradient, growth occurs radially, in all directions resulting in spherical aggregates, that is spherulites. The largest surfaces of the lamellae are terminated by molecular bends and kinks, and growth in this direction results in disordered regions. Therefore, spherulites have <b>semicrystalline</b> structure where highly ordered lamellae plates are interrupted by amorphous regions.|$|E

50|$|A true {{workhorse}} for polymer characterization is thermal analysis, particularly Differential scanning calorimetry. Changes in the compositional {{and structural}} {{parameters of the}} material usually affect its melting transitions or glass transitions and these in turn {{can be linked to}} many performance parameters. For <b>semicrystalline</b> polymers it is an important method to measure crystallinity. Thermogravimetric analysis can also give an indication of polymer thermal stability and the effects of additives such as flame retardants.Other thermal analysis techniques are typically combinations of the basic techniques and include differential thermal analysis, thermomechanical analysis, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, and dielectric thermal analysis.|$|E

50|$|There {{have also}} been reports {{that some of the}} solid states of polydioctylfluorene are {{composted}} in sheet-like layers which are about 50-100 nm thick. As a result of these sheets, the glassy and <b>semicrystalline</b> states can be formed (excluding amorphous, liquid crystalline, and beta chain states). When cooled quickly, the chains tightly align, giving PFO a close packing factor, though because of the high complexity of the chains, this sometimes gets messy and creates the amorphous state. The parts of the molecule that add this complexity are the carbon rings (that are located in the backbone) making the molecule overall large in size.|$|E
50|$|As {{the film}} is drawn upwards, it is cooled by a ring of air blowers so that the melt first becomes an {{amorphous}} viscoelastic solid, and then a <b>semicrystalline</b> solid, at {{what is known as}} the frost line. After solidification, the blown film tube continues to be cooled as it is pulled up by several sets of rollers, deflating the film to form lay-flat tubing. The flat film is then wound on a spool before further processing or shipping. The height of the film line is often 10 times the diameter of the blown tube or more; film lines in excess of 30 meters are possible.|$|E
50|$|Atactic {{polymers}} are technologically very important. A {{good example}} is polystyrene (PS). If a special catalyst is used in its synthesis {{it is possible to}} obtain the syndiotactic version of this polymer, but most industrial polystyrene produced is atactic. The two materials have very different properties because the irregular structure of the atactic version makes it impossible for the polymer chains to stack in a regular fashion. The result is that, whereas syndiotactic PS is a <b>semicrystalline</b> material, the more common atactic version cannot crystallize and forms a glass instead. This example is quite general in that many polymers of economic importance are atactic glass formers.|$|E
5000|$|A polymer is a macromolecule, {{composed}} of many similar or identical repeated subunits. Polymers are common, {{but not limited}} to organic media. They range from familiar synthetic plastics to natural biopolymers such as DNA and proteins. Their unique elongated molecular structure produces unique physical properties, including toughness, viscoelasticity, and a tendency to form glasses and <b>semicrystalline</b> structures. The modern concept of polymers as covalently bonded macromolecular structures was proposed in 1920 by Hermann Staudinger.One sub-field in the study of polymers is polymer physics. As a part of soft matter studies, Polymer physics concerns itself with the study of mechanical properties and focuses on the perspective of condensed matter physics.|$|E
