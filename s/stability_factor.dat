40|$|A new {{approach}} for computationally efficient estimation of <b>stability</b> <b>factors</b> for parametric partial differential equations is presented. The general parametric bilinear {{form of the}} problem is approximated by two affinely parametrized bilinear forms at different levels of accuracy (after an empirical interpolation procedure). The successive constraint method is applied on the coarse level to obtain a lower bound for the <b>stability</b> <b>factors,</b> and this bound is extended to the fine level by adding a proper correction term. Because the approximate problems are affine, an efficient offline/online computational scheme can be developed for the certified solution (error bounds and <b>stability</b> <b>factors)</b> of the parametric equations considered. We experiment with different correction terms suited for a posteriori error estimation of the reduced basis solution of elliptic coercive and noncoercive problems. © 2012 EDP Sciences, SMAI...|$|R

40|$|The {{original}} Hoek-Brown (HB) {{failure criterion}} {{was used to}} analyse the stability of rock slopes. For highly fractured rock, the original HB failure criterion has been modified, but {{its effect on the}} stability of rock slopes has not been studied. Within the framework of the kinematical approach of limit analysis, this paper computes the rigorous upper bounds of <b>stability</b> <b>factors</b> of homogeneous rock slopes with the modified HB failure criterion under the plane strain condition, by employing a 'generalized tangential' technique. In such technique, instead of using the modified HB failure criterion, a series of linear failure surfaces tangent to the actual non-linear failure surface are utilized to derive the upper bound solutions, incorporating a new parameter n ranging from 0. 5 to 0. 65. The numerical results are compared with other published solutions for the case of n = 0. 5. The effects of the n on the <b>stability</b> <b>factors</b> of rock slopes are discussed.

The data from the financial reports on IFRS – GAAP and the data on share prices of 54 companies over the period of 2003 – 2013 were used.

50|$|Narmour's (1992) Implication-Realization (I-R) Model is a {{detailed}} formalization based on Meyer's work on expectation. A {{fundamental difference between}} Narmour's models and most theories of expectation lies in the author's conviction according to which a genuine theory should be formulated in falsifiable terms.

The theory focuses on how implicative intervals set up expectations for certain realizations to follow. The I-R model includes two primary factors: proximity and direction.
