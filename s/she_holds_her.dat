2500|$|Gale {{was unlike}} any female {{character}} seen before on British TV {{and became a}} household name. Reportedly, part of her charm was because her earliest appearances were episodes in which dialogue written for Keel was simply transferred to her. Said series script writer Dennis Spooner [...] "there's the famous story of how Honor Blackman played Ian Hendry's part, {{which is why they}} stuck her in leather and such—it was so much cheaper than changing the lines!" [...] In [...] "Conspiracy of Silence" [...] <b>she</b> <b>holds</b> <b>her</b> own in a vociferous tactical disagreement with her partner.|$|E

6000|$|... "Think of {{something}} else, Varney," [...] said the Earl, in great agitation; [...] "this invention is nought. If I could {{give way to}} it, she would not; for I tell thee, Varney, if thou knowest it not, that not Elizabeth on the throne has more pride than the daughter of this obscure gentleman of Devon. She is flexible in many things, but where <b>she</b> <b>holds</b> <b>her</b> honour brought in question she hath a spirit and temper as apprehensive as lightning, and as swift in execution." ...|$|E

60|$|So, however, in {{this world}} of ours, which has both an indestructible hope in the Future, and an indestructible {{tendency}} to persevere as in the Past, must Innovation and Conservation wage their perpetual conflict, as they may and can. Wherein the 'daemonic element,' that lurks in all human things, may doubtless, some once in the thousand years--get vent! But indeed may we not regret that such conflict,--which, after all, is but like that classical one of 'hate-filled Amazons with heroic Youths,' and will end in embraces,--should usually be so spasmodic? For Conservation, strengthened by that mightiest quality in us, our indolence, sits for long ages, not victorious only, which she should be; but tyrannical, incommunicative. <b>She</b> <b>holds</b> <b>her</b> adversary as if annihilated; such adversary lying, all the while, like some buried Enceladus; who, to gain the smallest freedom, must stir a whole Trinacria with it Aetnas.|$|E
6000|$|So {{speaks the}} poor soul, in sore discouragement; for {{she knows that}} {{tomorrow}} any man, however vile and brutal, however godless and merciless, if he only has {{money to pay for}} her, may become owner of her daughter, body and soul; and then, how is the child to be faithful? She thinks of all this, as <b>she</b> <b>holds</b> <b>her</b> daughter in her arms, and wishes that she were not handsome and attractive. It seems almost an aggravation to her to remember how purely and piously, how much above the ordinary lot, she has been brought up. But she has no resort but to pray; and many such prayers to God have gone up from those same trim, neatly-arranged, respectable slave-prisons,--prayers which God has not forgotten, as a coming day shall show; for it is written, [...] "Who causeth one of these little ones to offend, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned {{in the depths of the}} sea." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lessening, I understand," [...] replied Mrs Smith. [...] "He thinks Mrs Clay {{afraid of}} him, {{aware that he}} sees through her, and not daring to proceed as she might do in his absence. But since he must be absent some time or other, I do not {{perceive}} how he can ever be secure while <b>she</b> <b>holds</b> <b>her</b> present influence. Mrs Wallis has an amusing idea, as nurse tells me, that {{it is to be}} put into the marriage articles when you and Mr Elliot marry, that your father is not to marry Mrs Clay. A scheme, worthy of Mrs Wallis's understanding, by all accounts; but my sensible nurse Rooke sees the absurdity of it. 'Why, to be sure, ma'am,' said she, 'it would not prevent his marrying anybody else.' And, indeed, to own the truth, I do not think nurse, in her heart, is a very strenuous opposer of Sir Walter's making a second match. She must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony, you know; and (since self will intrude) who can say that she may not have some flying visions of attending the next Lady Elliot, through Mrs Wallis's recommendation?" ...|$|E

6000|$|She is, even now, flagrantly illegal. She {{might be}} given in charge for hitting people at any time, and be warned, or fined, or given a week. But somehow {{it is only when}} she is overpast and I am {{recovering}} my wits that I recollect that she might be dealt with in this way. She is the chartered libertine of British matrons, and assaulteth where she listeth. The blows I have endured from her? She fights people who are getting into 'buses. It is no mere accidental jostling, but a deliberate shouldering, poking with umbrellas, and clawing. It is her delight to go to the Regent Circus corner of Piccadilly, about half-past seven in the evening, accompanied by a genteel rout of daughters, and fill up whole omnibuses with them. At that hour there are work-girls and tired clerks, and the like worn-out anæmic humanity trying to get home {{for an hour or so}} of rest before bed, and they crowd round the 'buses very eagerly. They are little able to cope with her exuberant vitality, being ill-nourished and tired from the day's work, and she simply mows through them and fills up every vacant place they covet before their eyes. Then, I can never count change even when my mind is tranquil, and she knows that, and swoops threateningly upon me in booking offices and stationers' shops. When I am dodging cabs at crossings she will appear from behind an omnibus or carriage and butt into me furiously. <b>She</b> <b>holds</b> <b>her</b> umbrella in her folded arms just as the Punch puppet does his staff, and with as deadly effect. Sometimes she discards her customary navy blue and puts on a glittering bonnet with bead trimmings, and goes and hurts people who are waiting to enter the pit at theatres, and especially to hurt me. She is fond of public shows, because they afford such possibilities of hurting me. Once I saw her standing partly on a seat and partly on another lady in the church of St. George's, Hanover Square, partly, indeed, watching a bride cry, but chiefly, I expect, scheming how she could get round to me and hurt me. Then there was an occasion at the Academy when she was peculiarly aggressive. I was sitting next my lame friend when she marked me. Of course she came at once and sat right upon us. [...] "Come along, Jane," [...] I heard her say, as I struggled to draw my flattened remains from under her; [...] "this gentleman will make room." ...|$|E
60|$|It is a bleak Day. Hear the Rain, how he pours, and the Hail, how he rattles; {{and see the}} Snow, how he drifts along, and of the Mud, {{how deep}} he is! Ah the poor Fishwife, it is stuck fast in the Mire; it has dropped its Basket of Fishes; and its Hands have been cut by the Scales as it seized some of the falling Creatures; and one Scale has even got into its Eye, and it cannot get her out. It opens its Mouth to cry for Help; but if any Sound comes out of him, alas he is drowned by the raging of the Storm. And now a Tomcat has {{got one of the}} Fishes and she will surely escape with him. No, she bites off a Fin, <b>she</b> <b>holds</b> <b>her</b> in her Mouth--will she swallow her? No, the Fishwife's brave Mother-dog deserts his Puppies and rescues the Fin--which he eats, himself, as his Reward. O, horror, the Lightning has struck the Fish-basket; he sets him on Fire; see the Flame, how she licks the doomed Utensil with her red and angry Tongue; now she attacks the {{helpless}} Fishwife's Foot--she burns him up, all but the big Toe, and even SHE is partly consumed; and still she spreads, still she waves her fiery Tongues; she attacks the Fishwife's Leg and destroys IT; she attacks its Hand and destroys HER also; she attacks the Fishwife's Leg and destroys HER also; she attacks its Body and consumes HIM; she wreathes herself about its Heart and IT is consumed; next about its Breast, and in a Moment SHE is a Cinder; now she reaches its Neck--He goes; now its Chin--IT goes; now its Nose--SHE goes. In another Moment, except Help come, the Fishwife will be no more. Time presses--is there none to succor and save? Yes! Joy, joy, with flying Feet the she-Englishwoman comes! But alas, the generous she-Female is too late: where now is the fated Fishwife? It has ceased from its Sufferings, it has gone to a better Land; all that is left of it for its loved Ones to lament over, is this poor smoldering Ash-heap. Ah, woeful, woeful Ash-heap! Let us take him up tenderly, reverently, upon the lowly Shovel, and bear him to his long Rest, with the Prayer that when he rises again it will be a Realm where he will have one good square responsible Sex, and have it all to himself, instead of having a mangy lot of assorted Sexes scattered all over him in Spots.|$|E
