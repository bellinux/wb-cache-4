The essential difference is that the role played by <b>split</b> <b>extensions</b> should be taken by asymptotically <b>split</b> <b>extensions.</b> We call an extension of a C ∗-algebra A by a stable C ∗-algebra B asymptotically split if there exists an asymptotic homomorphism consisting of right inverses for the quotient map. An extension is called semi-invertible if it can be made asymptotically split by adding another extension to it. Our main result is that there exists a one-to-one correspondence between asymptotic homomorphisms from SA to B and homotopy classes of semi-invertible extensions of S 2 A by B. ...|$|R
25|$|M21 has 168 simple {{subgroups of}} order 360 and 360 simple subgroups of order 168. In the larger {{projective}} general linear group PGL(3,4) {{both sets of}} subgroups form single conjugacy classes, but in M21 both sets split into 3 conjugacy classes. The subgroups respectively have orbits of 6, called hyperovals, and orbits of 7, called Fano subplanes. These sets allow creation of new blocks for larger Steiner systems. M21 is normal in PGL(3,4), of index 3. PGL(3,4) has an outer automorphism induced by transposing conjugate elements in F4 (the field automorphism). PGL(3,4) can therefore be extended to the group PΓL(3,4) of projective semilinear transformations, which is a <b>split</b> <b>extension</b> of M21 by the symmetric group S3.
