5|$|Park's {{equivalent}} {{and another}} of Dowding's commanders, AOC 12 Group Trafford Leigh-Mallory, held the opposite view. For him, large forces would win the battle by destroying large numbers of the enemy. This attrition <b>strategy</b> <b>would</b> use {{the concept of the}} Big Wing as its basis.|$|E
5|$|Carleton then {{launched}} his own offensive intended {{to reach the}} Hudson River, whose navigable length begins south of Lake Champlain and extends down to New York City. Control of the upper Hudson would enable the British to link their forces in Quebec with those in New York, recently captured in the New York campaign by Major General William Howe. This <b>strategy</b> <b>would</b> separate the American colonies of New England from those farther south and potentially quash the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|The Belgian {{strategy}} for a defence against German aggression faced political {{as well as}} military problems. In terms of military strategy, the Belgians were unwilling to stake everything on a linear defence of the Belgian–German border, in an extension of the Maginot Line. Such a move would leave the Belgians vulnerable to a German assault in their rear, through an attack on the Netherlands. Such a <b>strategy</b> <b>would</b> also rely on the French to move quickly into Belgium and support the garrison there.|$|E

40|$|Because the TeV-scale to be probed at the Large Hadron Collider should {{shed light}} on the naturalness, hierarchy, and dark matter problems, most {{searches}} to date have focused on new physics signatures motivated by possible solutions to these puzzles. In this paper, we consider some candidates for new states that although not well-motivated from this standpoint are obvious possibilities that current search <b>strategies</b> <b>would</b> miss. In particular we consider vector representations of fermions in multiplets of $SU(2) _L$ with a lightest neutral state. Standard search <b>strategies</b> <b>would</b> fail to find such particles because of the expected small one-loop-level splitting between charged and neutral states.

40|$|This paper explores {{a series}} of {{relationships}} between top managers, strategic direction and financial performance. Building on previous studies, it was hypothesised that: (a) firms pursuing different <b>strategies</b> <b>would</b> be led by managers with different profiles; and, (b) firms which aligned the profiles of their top managers {{with the requirements of}} their <b>strategies</b> <b>would</b> outperform those that did not achieve such alignment. Further the importance of the strategymanager alignment under various environmental and organisational constraints was also investigated. The results of the empirical examination of a sample of U. S. companies from three industries suggest that matching managers to strategy is a significant component of superior performance. Keywords...|$|R
5|$|In 431 BC, while peace {{already was}} precarious, ArchidamusII, Sparta's king, sent a new {{delegation}} to Athens, {{demanding that the}} Athenians submit to Sparta's demands. This deputation {{was not allowed to}} enter Athens, as Pericles had already passed a resolution according to which no Spartan deputation would be welcomed if the Spartans had previously initiated any hostile military actions. The Spartan army was at this time gathered at Corinth, and, citing this as a hostile action, the Athenians refused to admit their emissaries. With his last attempt at negotiation thus declined, Archidamus invaded Attica, but found no Athenians there; Pericles, aware that Sparta's <b>strategy</b> <b>would</b> be to invade and ravage Athenian territory, had previously arranged to evacuate the entire population of the region to within the walls of Athens.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{came in at}} {{the start}} of the second day's play and scored 34 of the next 48 runs added, before falling at 7/86, part of a {{collapse}} of 5/27. He hit two sixes in his innings, including one from the first ball that he faced, feeling that a defensive <b>strategy</b> <b>would</b> be almost impossible in the difficult conditions. Australia ended at 101, and Loxton was unable to bat due to injury. Frank Smailes had the best bowling figures for Yorkshire, 6/51. Yorkshire scored 89 in their second innings, which followed a similar pattern to their first effort. Wickets fell steadily as Johnston (6/18) and Miller (3/49) bowled 31.2 of the 36.2 overs.|$|E
5|$|The actual {{implementation}} of this strategy was left to the commander on site, Major General Walter Walker, {{a veteran of the}} Burma Campaign of the Second World War who had learned the hard lessons of the Malayan Emergency. Walker realised that a defensive <b>strategy</b> <b>would</b> leave all British forces tied down defending their bases, and instead determined to take the initiative from the aggressive Indonesians. Walker ordered that one-third of a unit should be left defending its base, which would be one of many along the border, while the remainder patrolled the jungle, foraying into Indonesian territory and attempting to keep them tied down at their headquarters instead. Thus, the British would attempt to control the jungle in the style of classic guerrilla warfare. But Walker was walking on a tightrope. His instructions, as were given to most colonial commanders, were to use 'minimum force' so as not to provoke Sukarno into escalating the conflict. However, he had to apply a certain level of destructive power to cow the aggressive and assertive Indonesians.|$|E

5|$|The {{context of}} the Confrontation in the murk of Indonesian {{politics}} is extremely layered. Sukarno's choice of pursuing this <b>strategy</b> <b>would</b> {{come at the expense}} of an important program aiming at the rehabilitation of the damaged economy, as it relied upon funding from Britain and America, who would not support the strengthening of another Communist power forming in Asia. However, the Indonesian populace and much of the government, who had recently fought their way from the hands of Dutch rule, would likely not support the economic program as it would seem as if Indonesia was sliding back into the embrace of the 'imperialist' powers of the West. The proposal was also beginning to lose support from the army, as they learned that demobilisation and lessening of funding that the program entailed would affect them adversely. Confrontation, on the other hand, might serve as a far more stabilising force, as it garnered support from both the Communists and the military, whose internecine political conflict weakened Sukarno's government. A campaign could keep the army busy while the Communists became accepted into mainstream Indonesian politics, which the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) found favourable. The nationalist-leaning army was content to fight the Malaysians to both remove British influence from the region as well as to establish Indonesian dominance in Southeast Asia. Some of the military high command thought that conflict could solidify a central role for the army in Indonesian politics, as well as increase their budget and return the country to martial law, which would greatly empower the military. Short of all-out war, the military was largely supportive of Confrontation.|$|E

25|$|Some writers {{contend that}} a {{defensive}} <b>strategy</b> <b>would</b> have made more {{sense for the}} US, conceding the sparsely populated Central Highlands and concentrating combat power in the more important and more populous coastal zones, {{at a cost of}} far fewer US troops, and less loss of public support. Others argue that a fundamental flaw in the American ground strategy was a focus on attrition rather than counterinsurgency to secure the population.|$|E
25|$|Two vote {{management}} systems exist in STV. Vote equalisation works for all systems except those that allow group voting (above the line voting). The other method, party designated transfer, only works for systems that allow group voting.

40|$|The {{fragmentation}} of strategies that distinguishes {{the more successful}} elementary grade students from those least successful has been documented previously.

Twenty-six undergraduate students enrolled in a remedial algebra course used a reform curriculum, {{with the concept of}} function as an organizing lens and graphing calculators during the 1997 fall semester. These students could be characterized as "victims of the proceptual divide, " constrained by inflexible strategies and by prior procedural learning and/or teaching.

Charles, Duke of Mayenne was able to convince Henry IV and Biron not to confront the huge relief army, but {{to remain in the}} entrenchments knowing they were outnumbered nearly two to one if in open battle. This <b>strategy</b> <b>would</b> be successful, and Mansfeld's force appeared six miles below Amiens on 18 September upon the banks of the Somme.|$|E
25|$|The grand {{strategy}} favoured at Dublin, of attacking by {{land and sea}} simultaneously, was probably impossible with English resources, given the rumours of a fresh Armada from Spain {{and the need to}} keep warships in southern waters. The amphibious expedition to establish a northern base at Lough Foyle was abandoned, and the Dublin Council switched from an immediate attack on O'Neill and his confederate, Hugh Roe O'Donnell, when it became clear the <b>strategy</b> <b>would</b> fail through want of forage, cattle, and draught-horses. But this advice was declined by the Privy Council at London, which settled on a straight attack north into Ulster.|$|E
25|$|On 2 September the Canadian Corps and British XVII Corps {{took the}} Drocourt-Queant Line.

Haig gave orders (3 September) to advance cautiously but to avoid “deliberate operations on a large scale” to conserve manpower for the forthcoming decisive battle. Haig thought the Germans’ optimal <b>strategy</b> <b>would</b> be to abandon the Hindenburg Line and retreat to the Antwerp-Meuse Line, but although this was indeed Hindenburg’s preference Ludendorff would not contemplate it.|$|E

25|$|The Battle of the Nablus Plain {{ranks with}} Ludendorff's Black Days of the German Army in {{the effect that}} it had on the {{consciousness}} of the Turkish General Staff. It was now apparent to all but the most diehard nationalists that the Turks were finished in the war. In spite of the great victories in Armenia and in Azerbaijan, Turkey was now in an indefensible condition, which could not be remedied with the resources on hand. It was also apparent that the disintegration of the Bulgarian Army at Salonika and the dissolution of the Austro–Hungarian Army spelled disaster and defeat for the Central Powers. From now until the Armistice, the focus of the Turkish <b>strategy</b> <b>would</b> be to retain as much Ottoman territory as possible.|$|E
25|$|Manchester City Council was not rate-capped.

When, the following week, the opposition Liberal Party group on the council called a special meeting to propose their own budget (which included a 4.4% rate rise), the council leader Graham Stringer insisted that the no rate <b>strategy</b> <b>would</b> continue.

25|$|Petraeus had a {{strategy}} to influence military conditions by using the press relations effectively in the theater and in Washington, according to critics of the general's military career after his fall from power. On November 13, 2012, Reagan administration Assistant Secretary of Defense Lawrence Korb, C.I.A. analyst and Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity co-founder Ray McGovern, and investigative journalist Gareth Porter appeared on Al Jazeera English. Together they assessed the general's extensive military-medi{{a strategy}} linking his writings on counterguerrilla operations and subsequent military media efforts, to his downfall with his female biographer.
