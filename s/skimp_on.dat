Rectifications led to a restricted loading gauge along the line, requiring the use of dedicated rolling stock.|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Keith DeCandido {{reviewed}} the episode for Tor.com, saying that [...] "while this episode has its flaws, it's a wonderful example of science fiction, one that doesn't <b>skimp</b> <b>on</b> suspense, action, and Trek's trademark compassion." [...] He didn't like the film direction by Allen, saying that the director had a [...] "bizarre insistence on unnatural, stage-y blocking and positioning and obsession with extreme closeups". DeCandido also thought that the plot suffered [...] "amnesia regarding the Horta" [...] from The Original Series episode [...] "The Devil in the Dark". He gave [...] "Home Soil" [...] an overall score of seven out of ten. Michelle Erica Green, in her review for TrekNation, thought that the episode was [...] "less interesting" [...] than the [...] "Horta attacks and mind-melds" [...] of [...] "The Devil in the Dark". [...] She also felt [...] "Home Soil" [...] was too similar [...] "in the science fiction and in the storytelling" [...] to the previous episode, [...] "When the Bough Breaks".|$|E

500|$|Supervision of the {{construction}} was lax, which enabled the contractors to <b>skimp</b> <b>on</b> {{the lining of the}} tunnels. This manifested itself in March 1855 when part of the brickwork of Mountfield Tunnel collapsed. An inspection of Grove Hill, Strawberry Hill and Wells tunnels revealed that they too had been constructed with too few layers of bricks. Grove Hill Tunnel had been built with just a single ring of bricks and no filling above the crown of the brickwork. The SER took the contractors to court and were awarded £3,500 in damages. However, rectifying the situation cost the company £4,700. Although the contractors had charged for six rings of bricks, they had only used four. Due to the cost of reboring the tunnels, this had to be rectified by the addition of a further two rings of brickwork, reducing the width of the tunnels by [...] The result of this was that the loading gauge on the line was restricted, and special rolling stock had to be built, later becoming known as Restriction 0 rolling stock. This problem would affect the line until 1986.|$|E
500|$|An {{enhanced}} remake titled Mega Man Powered Up — {{known as}} [...] in Japan — was released worldwide for the PSP in 2006. The game features a graphical overhaul with 3D chibi-style character models with large heads and small bodies. Inafune had originally planned to make Mega Man look this way, {{but could not}} due to the hardware constraints of the NES. Producer Tetsuya Kitabayashi stated that redesigning the character models {{was a result of}} the PSP's 16:9 widescreen ratio. The larger heads on the characters allowed the development team to create visible facial expressions. [...] "The concept for these designs was 'toys'. We wanted cute designs geared towards little kids ... the kinds of characters that you'd see hanging off of keychains and such," [...] character designer Tatsuya Yoshikawa explained. [...] "Not only that, I made sure to tell the designers not to <b>skimp</b> <b>on</b> any of the original Mega Man details. We wanted their proportions and movements to be accurately reflected in these designs as well." [...] As the size of the remake's stages are not proportional to those of the original, the widescreen ratio also presented the developers with more space to fill.|$|E
500|$|Scott D. Pierce of the Deseret News praised Kim Possible as [...] "an {{entertaining}} {{show that}} should indeed appeal to tweens, younger kids {{and even their}} parents" [...] that [...] "plays with the superhero format {{in a way that}} doesn't take itself too seriously but doesn't play down to the viewers." [...] Tracy McLoone of PopMatters reviewed, [...] "Kim Possible includes adult-friendly humor, in the event that parents feel the need to watch tv (sic) with their kids. But nobody in or watching the series will ever be offended or over-stimulated, or even surprised." [...] While accepting main character Kim as a positive role model and acknowledging that the series sometimes teaches [...] "good lessons", Besty Wallace of Common Sense Media expressed concern about the show's emphasis on action and violence, explaining, [...] "lessons may get muddled and nearly lost as the heroes shimmy up rope ladders dangling from helicopters and dodge spinning tops of doom. As long as you're not expecting too {{much in the way of}} educational value, you'll probably have plenty of fun with this one." [...] Writing for Bustle, Sarah Freymiller opined, [...] "Ultimately, Kim Possible was just a solid show. It didn't <b>skimp</b> <b>on</b> plot or dialogue in favor of Wile E. Coyote explosions, and its tongue-in-cheek humor allowed it to be self-aware and hip at the same time." [...] Conversely, Girlfighting: Betrayal and Rejection Among Girls author Lyn Mikel Brown was less receptive towards Kim herself, criticizing the show for promoting the beautiful and thin heroine as [...] "your basic average girl" [...] and apparent reliance on Ron's intelligence, as well as the fact that her [...] "biggest threat" [...] is Bonnie as opposed to evil. According to Brown, [...] "Being the kind of girl who's accepted or befriended by boys underscores a girl's power and sets her against other girls." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{purpose of}} the Food Stamp Program as laid out in its {{implementation}} was to assist low-income households in obtaining adequate and nutritious diets. According to Peter H. Rossi, a sociologist whose work involved evaluation of social programs, [...] "the program rests {{on the assumption that}} households with restricted incomes may <b>skimp</b> <b>on</b> food purchases and live on diets that are inadequate in quantity and quality, or, alternatively <b>skimp</b> <b>on</b> other necessities to maintain an adequate diet". Food stamps, as many like Rossi, MacDonald, and Eisinger contend, are used not only for increasing food but also as income maintenance. Income maintenance is money that households are able to spend on other things because they no longer have to spend it on food. According to various studies shown by Rossi, because of income maintenance only about $0.17–$0.47 more is being spent on food for every food stamp dollar than was spent prior to individuals receiving food stamps.|$|E

When Tuco is killed by Hank, his cousins vow revenge.

Gustavo Fring's franchise Los Pollos Hermanos translates to [...] "The Chicken Brothers." [...] This refers {{to the fact that}} the company was co-founded by Gus and a man named Max, with whom he shared a close personal connection. When Max is killed by Hector Salamanca, Gus vows to destroy the Salamanca family. In the first part of the fifth season, it is explained that Mike Ehrmantraut's intentions for being in this business were to provide for his granddaughter's future, and by his final episode we see him conflicted when having to leave her in a park by herself once he's warned the police are onto him. During the second part of the fifth season, white supremacist Jack Welker says [...] "don't <b>skimp</b> <b>on</b> family," [...] and he lets Walt live after capturing him in the desert because of love for his nephew Todd Alquist, who has great respect for Walt. Later, Lydia Rodarte-Quayle repeatedly demands that if Mike insists on killing her, that he leave her in her apartment so her daughter can find her, fearful she will think she abandoned her.
