Single skin construction is simpler, and usually uses RF welding to make the seams. These bladders are usually lighter and dry out more quickly than <b>double</b> <b>skin</b> wings, but if the bladder is punctured, a new bladder is relatively easily fitted to a <b>double</b> <b>skin</b> wing, while repair of the single skin bladder may not be practicable, depending on material and construction details. Single skin wings are also easier to decontaminate, particularly if the outer surface is smooth.Single skin wings may use a bellows fold gusset to increase inflatable volume while retaining a relatively compact outline. This can reduce drag while swimming when the bladder is deflated.|$|R

40|$|<b>Double</b> <b>skin</b> facades {{are defined}} as two layers of facade {{separated}} by an air gap, that varies in its depth creating a solar chimney effect where warm air rises by buoyancy. As a facade technology, its thermal and daylight performance is still under scientific scrutiny. The bulk {{of research on the}} performance of this facade configuration is carried out in moderate climates. However, little is understood about the performance of <b>double</b> <b>skin</b> facade configurations in extreme hot arid climates. This investigation adopts an analytical approach using a dynamic simulation software (IESVE), to convert general intuitions on the performance of a <b>double</b> <b>skin</b> facade, in hot arid areas, into the grounds of understanding its performance based on research. It is an opportunity to study this facade configuration before the technology is transferred into construction in hot arid areas.

The thermal performance of anisotropic material of thermal conductivity was presented by ro-tating the original rectangular axes {{so as to}} determine the principal axes and make the cross-derivative terms disappear.

The system induces the efficient blocking of sunlight using a center blind during the summer season. Moreover, it enables overheated air in the cavity layer to be sent outdoors, resulting in a reduction of the use of energy for cooling. However, <b>double</b> <b>skin</b> facade systems can be problematic, in that they must be opened according to seasonal conditions to achieve greater energy consumption efficiencies.

40|$|The aim of {{this report}} is to {{describe}} the concept of <b>Double</b> <b>Skin</b> Façades based on different sources of literature. Although the concept is not new, {{there is a growing}} tendency from the architects to put it into practice. Its complexity and adaptability to different climatic conditions increase the need for careful design. Since the construction types can differ from one location to another, {{it is obvious that the}} comparison of different literature sources is not always relevant. Since the concept of <b>Double</b> <b>Skin</b> Facades is complicated and its use and function affects different parameters of the building, the literature studied is from different fields. It is clear that the design of the system is crucial for the performance of the building. It is the opinion of the author that the <b>Double</b> <b>Skin</b> Facades can provide both improved indoor climate and reduced use of energy in the same time if designed properly. If the approach is overall and the goals to be achieved are clear, then the mentioned system is flexible enough to meet climatic changes for most types of building use. The classification of the <b>Double</b> <b>Skin</b> Facades is important since the initial approach can influence the design stage. After selecting the type of Double Façade appropriate for the building, it is necessary to define the design and the technical parameters (such as the materials used) that can influence the function and the performance of the system and the physical properties of the cavity. The accuracy of calculations of the façade performance in the design stage will lead to more precise predictions. It is clear that by prioritizing the main goals of the double façade system in different ways, the building design and construction can differ adapting to the performance requirements of the designers, and the needs of the users.
