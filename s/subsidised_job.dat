Overall, activation policies aim at a rapid integration into the labour market as employment is seen as the best way to counteract long-term benefits dependency.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of {{business}} subsidies on the employment of firms in Finland, and explores possible regional differences in the effects. Employment of some 26, 000 firms is followed annually between 1995 - 1998. We find that labour subsidies increase the firms' own employment payroll on average by 11 per cent. The marginal effect of subsidies however, is about 34 per cent. As firms pay, on average, 60 per cent of the employment payroll of a worker in a <b>subsidised</b> <b>job,</b> our results suggest that labour subsidies displace the firms' own employment expenditures. Moreover, the regional analysis indicates that the displacement effect has been milder in the Helsinki region than elsewhere, contributing to the divergence of regional economies. As {{an exception to the}} rule however, in some peripheral areas displacement has also been low. Finally, we do not find displacement or stimulation effects in the application of (i) Investment and Operation subsidies or (ii) R&D subsidies.

Training seems to have no positive effect on employment or wages and job placement has only modest positive effects over and above the simple job search assistance. However, the Colombian programmes seem to hold some promise that well targeted training programmes combined with job placement can improve outcomes for a population that is considered trainable {{in the context of a}} middle income country with a large skill deficit. This leaves the question open of what can be done for those too unskilled even to be trained effectively as adults. We have no direct answer to this.

The act of taking up income-generating work can take various forms: taking up a job, setting up a business or taking advantage of <b>subsidised</b> <b>job</b> programmes. Jobseekers are often deregistered from poviat labour offices because they refuse to take up an offered job or fail to report to the office in due time. All the above events are forms of competing risk. The purpose of this paper is to use the cumulative incidence function to assess the probability of the unemployment exit with regard to different types of the competing risk. When competing-risk events occur, a solution sometimes is used where the remaining endpoint events are considered censored observations. Such a solution leads to an overestimation of probability. The results implicate that the beneficiaries’ will to find employment was not a principal reason for a registering decision.

If <b>subsidised</b> <b>jobs</b> are excluded from the employment measure, the picture changes dramatically.

The present prospective cohort study of 6028 public sector employees in Finland investigated social capital as a workplace characteristic which potentially affects employee health. The two indicators of social capital were trust in the labour market, measured by security of the employment contract, and trust in co-worker support. Self-rated health status and psychological distress were used as indicators of health. The combination of <b>subsidised</b> <b>job</b> contract and low co-worker support (i. e. the lowest category of social capital) was associated with poorer health prospects than the combination of permanent employment and high support (the highest social capital category) in an age-adjusted model, but this association disappeared in logistic regression analysis adjusted by sociodemographic background factors and baseline health. Fixed-term employment predicted better self-rated health and less psychological distress when compared with permanent employment. Co-worker support was most common in permanent and least common in subsidised employees and it was associated with better self-rated health in women.

40|$|We analyse the {{consequences}} of starting a wage <b>subsidised</b> <b>job,</b> "marginal employment", for unemployed workers. Marginal employment {{is a type of}} wage subsidy paid to unemployed workers and they do not lose their unemployment benefits if the wage is below a certain threshold. We ask if the unemployed who start marginal jobs face better labour market outcomes than those who do not work. A priori it is not clear if those who work in marginal employment improve their labour market status, e. g. by signalling effort, or worsen it by reduced job search effort. We select unemployed workers and investigate the effect of marginal employment on their labour market outcomes, by means of propensity score matching. Our results suggest that selection into marginal employment is "negative", i. e. workers with characteristics we usually associate with low-productivity are more likely to select into such jobs. The unemployed who start to work in marginal employment during their unemployment spell suffer a (causal) penalty for doing so, relative to their peers who do not. The penalty, in terms of less employment, more unemployment, lower wages, lessens over time but is still present after three years. marginal employment; atypical employment; labour supply; propensity score matching...|$|E

Around three quarters of working age people have jobs – a higher proportion than in France, Germany and even the United States. According to the government, ‘At the heart of this success has been welfare to work policies such as the New Deal programme. Since it was launched the programme has helped almost a million people back to work’. By contrast, the Conservative Party is pledged to scrap most of the New Deal programme. The New Deal for the Unemployed comprises ‘carrot and stick’. Everyone on Jobseeker’s Allowance gets help with job search from a dedicated ‘personal adviser ’ (after six months of claiming the allowance for unemployed people aged less than 25 years old and after eighteen months for others). If unemployed people still cannot find a job after four months, they are entitled to four options, including a full-time education/training option or a <b>subsidised</b> <b>job.</b> This is mandatory: there is no ‘fifth option ’ of staying on benefits. • By December 2004, there were 67, 820 people under 25 years old and 51, 970 people over 25 years old participating in the New Deal for the Unemployed. The best evaluations of the programme suggest that it has raised the chances of unemployed people finding a job by between 5 % and 7 %. This effect appears after four months and seems to persist for at least one year. Expenditure on the New Deal for Young People is forecast at £ 330 million in 2005 / 06.

Most authors, however, conclude that the effect of employment subsidies is positive, albeit modest (Katz 1996; OECD 2005; Kluve 2010; Immervoll and Scarpetta 2012; Neumark 2013; Neumark and Grijalva 2013).|$|R
40|$|Enticing {{young people}} {{to stay on the}} land is no easy task. There is little to persuade people to stay in the village, except the village itself. The well-intentioned {{arguments}} and campaigns of their elders are, youth being youth, often rejected, sometimes unkindly. For most rural youth, farming is a fate, not a future. Are we hearing them? Rivers to cross, roads to travel, dreams to build. From Fiji s river Rewa, on the Mopti road in Mali, to the June 2000 Youth conference in Maputo, Mozambique, young people will always yearn for more. Photo H. Guillaume/IRD (ex-Orstom) (Kingston, Jamaica, late October 2000.) Two score young people and more passed through the capital city s airport today en route to finding a better future working in American hotels than their native Jamaican fields could offer. Incidentally, a handful of the nation s upper middle-class also slipped out on the same flight, voting with their feet, having the same effect on the economy as Ebola fever has on humans, and setting a Very Bad Example to the nation s youth. And the incoming plane delivers a clutch of sullen young Jamaicans home, accompanied by the legal officers of a northern economy that could neither understand nor accommodate them. A few miles away, Richard Williams tells Spore: 'Mi father spend all im live in a de country seh im a farm, a mus eh fool im did a farm because im no have nothin fe show, mi nah do that. ' (My father spent all his life in the country, on a farm, see, and he must have been a fool because he has nothing to show for it; I m not going to do that.) How many times are scenarios like these to be seen in an ACP country? How many young people a day turn their backs for good on the village whence they came, to return only at times of grieving, feasting and retirement? Whatever the answer, or the definition of youth, the numbers are crushing. One-fifth of the world is aged between 15 and 24; in sub-Saharan Africa four in five people are under 30 years old and the majority are, today, rural. Change is on its way. According to recent studies by the FAO, it will only be {{a matter of time before}} city youths outnumber the rural: by 2025, there will be more than one billion urban youths, and as today 700 million young rural people, the great majority in developing countries. FAO has for many decades shown concern for rural youth: in the early 1960 s it ran a Youth Against Hunger campaign. FAO believes that 'rural youth programmes have a very important role to play in helping youths who do decide to stay in rural areas, to have more satisfying and productive lives. ' Photo Penny Tweedie/Panos Pictures Such programmes, however, have often been among the first to be cut, as extension programmes have been run down throughout the developing world as part of structural adjustment programmes. Those same programmes have removed the employment opportunities that used to exist in the public sector. Countries which can still afford the luxury of the <b>subsidised</b> <b>job</b> creation schemes that temporarily mop up youth unemployment, whether urban or rural, are few and far between. Such schemes persist in northern economies, but in ACP economies, both traditional and transitional, they are found only in some small island states in the Pacific and the Caribbean and, on the African continent, mainly in the relatively affluent states of southern and South Africa. The latter s African Youth Development Initiative is paralleled by a planned national youth service, in which young people can learn some skills and work on community service and agricultural production programmes for a year or two. The rigidity of such schemes is almost quaint in face of the market and other forces that are changing agricultural landscapes in ACP countries, and they are unlikely to have a lasting impact. There are other, more enlightened programmes to help young people enter the (rural) economy, even though they too suffer from a certain inflexibility. Kenya s Youth Enterprise programme operates through five training institutions in providing a safe track for rural youth to permanent work in the form of self-employment in agriculture and agrifood processing enterprises. It has learned the hard way in offering micro-credit to rural youth with neither collateral, nor possessions, nor a track record on which to base a go-with-the-flow repayment strategy from income. One softener is to enhance young people s technical skills, but too often the training institutions are familiar only with the ways of the unwelcoming formal sector, and are not familiar with helping young people, and the financial and technical advisory services around them, to deal with the rough-and-tumble of the informal sector. Similar experiences in Jamaica s micro-enterprise development programmes from the early nineties onwards clearly went unheeded, or, more probably, unheard in other countries. Indeed, more information exchange between innovators in rural youth programmes is often called for in professional fora, and the value of direct youth-to-youth exchanges between countries and regions is recognised as a great motivator. The potential of information and communication technologies (ICT) in helping such contacts is well accepted, more by young people themselves than by their elders. Their openness and enthusiasm for new ideas and new technologies makes sure of that, and is the basis for such programmes as those in Senegal, Uganda and Zambia where ICTs are being used to improve networking between agricultural NGOs and producer groups. The point is that agriculture needs to be perceived not only as a financially sound sector to work in (which depends on the market, and how it is organised), but also as something modern and challenging. If only today s scientists could be coaxed and coached to better communicate their work on new foods and new diets (such as differently coloured bananas, or repackaging traditional foods in a modern style to capture new diaspora markets), agriculture would immediately become more attractive. If educators and trainers could loosen up to working with out-of-school youth, if banks would allocate an extra slice of their spread (operating margin) in loans to youth start-up enterprises, if politicians could be less patronising, if only, if only. At the 1999 UN African Development Forum on the new information society, the youth delegation affirmed that 'new technologies can be used to unleash creativity and innovation among young people.

Despite this, studies {{on the effects of}} policies aimed at enhancing the labour market inclusion among people with disabilities, such as targeted wage subsidies, are surprisingly few. In an attempt to fill this gap, we have studied how wage subsidies affect future labour market outcomes for jobseekers with disabilities, in terms of employment and disability retirement. By using inverse probability weighting applied to rich Swedish register data, we contrast participants in the wage subsidy program to observably similar non-participants during a 19 -year period. We find that participation was associated with both positive and negative labour market outcomes. On the negative side, participants were less likely to have unsubsidised employment. On the positive side, leaving the labour market through the disability insurance program was somewhat less common among participants. Moreover, using a broader employment measure including <b>subsidised</b> <b>jobs,</b> the participants were found to be employed to a larger extent, which could be interpreted either as locking-in effects or as fostering labour market inclusion.|$|R
40|$|Theoretical and {{empirical}} works on job search often neglect {{the role of}} unemployed environment like spatial constraints meets while searching for a job. This paper proposes a job search model where both the spatial search area and the reservation wage {{are assumed to be}} endogenous. We exploit data from a French survey conducted by Research Direction of Employment Ministry (DARES) to estimate the structural parameters of the model. First we estimate the choice of the search area, i. e. the choice between passive (receiving job offers through the local public employment agencies) and active strategies (extending the job search area using others search channels). Using a bivariate probit model, we highlight that this choice depends significantly on individual attributes and spatial constraints and that it affects job quality. Besides, the independence of irrelevant alternatives is not rejected. Secondly, using Gamma duration model we treat both individual and unobservable heterogeneity and the multiple destinations after unemployment (long-term jobs, short-term <b>jobs</b> and <b>subsidised</b> <b>jobs).</b> Moreover, estimations are made on sub-samples in which individuals are homogenous according to their level of diploma and their situation towards the unemployment insurance.

30|$|Traditional job {{creation}} schemes that focus on public and non-profit sector employment actually harm the prospects of participants to find regular employment. Yet there are (in particular hard-to-place) groups of participants, for which this type of treatment is beneficial. For the work opportunity scheme that was introduced in January 2005 and that is restricted to relatively-hard-to-place welfare recipients positive employment effects are found. They are moderate when participation is implemented as workfare, but considerable when participants work in <b>subsidised</b> contributory <b>jobs.</b> Another more recently introduced program “the employment subsidy” rather leads to considerable lock-in-effects, which might reflect some creaming.|$|R
30|$|We {{find that}} {{participants}} in the wage subsidy program had a much larger subsequent overall employment rate. In the year of (potential) program enrolment, the gap was as large as 54 percentage points. Obviously, most of this difference is mechanical and corresponds to the program participation per se. However, although the gap closed during the years that followed, a 11 percentage point difference remained after 10 years. When excluding <b>subsidised</b> <b>jobs</b> from the employment outcome measure, the picture changed dramatically. In the year of (potential) program enrolment, the employment rate was instead 21 percentage points lower among the participants than among the non-participants. After 2 years, the gap had closed to 11 percentage points and then vanished gradually. Hence, any positive employment effect of program participation {{seems to have been}} outweighed by considerable locking-in effects, not only in the short run but also in the longer run. We also found a lower percentage of disability insurance receivers among the participants than among the non-participants. While the percentage of disability insurance receivers among the participants was 2 points higher during the year of (potential) program enrolment and the next year, this gap had reversed by the third year and remained at about this level {{during the rest of the}} 10 -year period. Hence, the wage subsidy program seems to have promoted labour market inclusion somewhat by reducing the transition out of the labour force through the disability insurance program.|$|R
40|$|In {{view of the}} above-average {{extent to}} which the {{severely}} disabled are affected by unemployment, with a high proportion of long-term unemployed, there are in principle two options for a selective labour market policy aimed at reducing discrimination on the labour market. Firstly an attempt can be made to improve the labour market prospects of particularly disadvantaged groups of people by increasing the efficiency of employment and training measures and raising target group orientation. Starting out from the assumption that the poor chances of reintegration of severely disabled people are caused by supposed disadvantages in productivity, both labour market intermediaries (job placement) and intermediate labour markets (alternative forms of employment between unemployment and a normal employment relationship) are studied with regard to the {{extent to which the}}y can give companies indications of the capability of job applicants and in this way increase the reintegration prospects of problem groups on the labour market. This possibility of screening is provided in particular by the instrument of placement-orientated temporary work via employment agencies.

(2) For all possible values of the observed characteristics (X) among the participants, there are also non-participants with the same values (i.e. the overlap or common support condition): p(X)< 1. In Section 3.2. 5, we present an assessment of this condition. (3) The outcomes of one individual are not affected by the assignment of other individuals to the program (i.e. the stable unit treatment value assumption [SUTVA]). This assumption is invoked in all microeconometric evaluations of labour market programs and we cannot test its validity. Obviously, {{it is possible that the}} <b>subsidised</b> <b>jobs</b> might crowd out some unsubsidised jobs, imposing a negative bias on our estimates on non-subsidised employment. There is no reason, however, to expect that the estimates on disability retirement are affected by similar biases. (4) The propensity score model is specified correctly. This is also an untestable assumption. While it is likely to be invalid in most, if not all, observational studies, we take the view that the objective of IPW is to create a weighted pseudo-sample such that the measured confounders are balanced between the participants and non-participants; to what extent balance is achieved is assessed in Section 3.2. 6.|$|R
40|$|The present thesis {{contributes}} to the theoretical analysis of the human capital investment and participation decision of heterogeneous workers in the search and matching framework. Its aim is to characterise the equilibrium and to identify the efficiency. The first chapter of this thesis {{contributes to}} study equilibrium search and matching to consider the participation decision of heterogeneous workers who have different inherent ability level. The productivity investment decision is endogenous and wages {{are determined by the}} Nash bargain among participants. In steady-state equilibrium investment decision reveals the hold-up problem. Given overall labor market condition, equilibrium is determined by free entry condition, optimal productivity investment decision, the participation constraint plus the steady state conditions. In this model I also show that heterogeneity is not the cause of multiplicity. The second chapter utilises the previous analysis to identify those government policies that can achieve efficiency in an economy. I show that the number of labor market participants and job creation and productivity investment are inefficient owing to externalities resulting from participation decision, productivity investment and market tightness condition. Therefore, in my first best policy scenario, I find the government should subsidise training, tax labour market participation and <b>subsidise</b> <b>job</b> creation. The last chapter considers an integrated framework where social security benefits are chosen to induce optimal search by unemployed workers given the income tax structure imposed by the government. As tax policy distorts the willingness of workers to find employment, it provides a simple rule which identifies the link between optimal social security benefits paid and the tax system. Specifically {{in the case of a}} universal, linear income tax scheme, optimal social security benefits should be paid at a flat rate; i. e. all receive the same benefit level regardless of earnings which is the main contribution of the paper...|$|R
