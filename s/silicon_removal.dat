A new closed-form analytical transmission line model that is valid for both conventional coplanar waveguide (CPW) and hicoplanar is introduced and compared with simulations and experimental re-sults. The major novelties of the model are that it includes {{the effect of the}} conductor height on the output parameters and combines Wheeler’s inductance rule and perturbation theory to predict the line resistance. Transmission lines with characteristic impedances of 18 – 25 have been fabricated on high-resistivity silicon. Atten-uation was measured to be 2. 4 – 3. 4 dB/cm at 30 GHz before <b>silicon</b> <b>removal</b> and 1. 7 – 2. 4 dB/cm at 30 GHz after <b>silicon</b> <b>removal.</b> The analytical model is compared with Ansoft High Frequency Struc-ture Simulator simulations and experimental data and shows ex-cellent agreement.

40|$|AbstractThe {{performance}} of PERC solar cells benefits from a smooth rear surface {{due to a}} reduced surface recombination and increased light trapping. State of the art surface roughness is defined solely by the polishing <b>silicon</b> <b>removal.</b> However the initial texture height can vary, therefore there is no universal definition of roughness. In this work roughness parameters from an earlier study {{will be used to}} determine the rear surface roughness of mono-crystalline industrial p-type solar cells [1]. The effects of rear side roughness on the passivation quality and thus minority carrier lifetime will be discussed. Additionally the influence of rear side roughness on reflection and therefore light trapping will be investigated. Furthermore solar cells with PERC concept are presented. Up to now used roughness parameters describe vertical structures and thus represent polishing results but they are not sensitive to horizontal structure expansion. Effective lifetime of polished samples first increases with decreasing roughness. For further polishing values stagnate or decrease. Implied VOC of saw damage etched surface is higher compared to polished surface although they show similar vertical roughness, hence there are more parameters influencing passivation quality than vertical roughness. According to roughness measurements nano-roughness, valleys and horizontal structure expansion seem to affect passivation quality in addition to vertical roughness. Decreasing roughness increases reflection at 1200 nm and thus increases light trapping. As the highest benefit in light trapping appears with decreasing structure height, vertical structure expansion seems to affect back reflection less than horizontal structures. Solar cell results cannot confirm the results of implied VOC and reflection measurements but prove the benefit of smooth rear sides. For polished polished rear sides the gain in efficiency is decreasing with increasing <b>silicon</b> <b>removal...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{first part}} of our study {{introduces}} a new method for rapidly generating an "improved" Stribeck curve (i. e. Stribeck+ curve) that, compared to traditional Stribeck curves, shows a more complete tribological picture of the chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) process. The method significantly reduces the consumables and time required to obtain the curve compared to traditional means. Results of the Stribeck+ curve are consistent with individual tests using several different consumables combinations. All copper CMP Stribeck+ examples clearly indicate the lubrication mechanism and transitions thereof between different polishing conditions. Variability in COF {{as well as a}} much wider range in U/P are also explored. In the second part of our study, the Stribeck+ curve is successfully applied to silicon dioxide CMP processes to characterize the tribology of such processes under different process conditions and consumables. Results show our Stribeck+ curve methodology to be capable of rapidly determining and differentiating the tribological mechanism among all cases studied. The Stribeck+ curve helps indicate process stability as shown by the spread of the COF vertical clusters. The Stribeck+ curve also confirms a previously known effect that the greater the ratio of pad’s up-features to the total pad area, the greater the probability of wafer hydroplaning. As the third part of our study, we investigate the effect of different pad surface micro-textures on the tribological, thermal and kinetic attributes during copper CMP. Different micro-textures are generated by two different chemical vapor deposited (CVD) diamond-coated conditioner discs (i. e. Disc A and Disc B). Results show that while pad temperature and removal rate increase with polishing pressure and sliding velocity on both discs, Disc B generates consistently lower removal rates and COF than Disc A. To fundamentally elucidate the cause(s) of such differences, pad surface contact area and topography are analyzed using laser confocal microscopy. The comparison of the pad surface micro-texture analysis indicates that Disc A causes a pad surface with a smaller abruptness (λ) and much more solid contact area which results in a higher removal rate. In contrast, Disc B generates less contact areas and COF. A two-step modified Langmuir–Hinshelwood model is employed to simulate copper removal rates as well as chemical and mechanical rate constants. The simulated chemical to mechanical constant ratios indicate that Disc A produces a more mechanically limited process under all conditions tested. In the fourth part of our study, the position of a slurry injection system (SIS) is optimized to achieve a more cost-effective and environmentally benign CMP process using a widely-adopted ceria-based "reverse slurry". Here, SIS is configured with different angles in order to investigate slurry dilution characteristics caused by residual pad rinsing with ultrapure water (UPW) that is known to affect <b>silicon</b> dioxide <b>removal.</b> UPW dilution effect on removal rate, coefficient of friction and pad surface temperature is explained by maintaining a constant dilution ratio for each of the SIS configuration tests. Results indicate that SIS negative rotation angles increase the actual slurry dilution ratio on top of the polishing pad. This generates more Ce 3 + which boosts removal rates. Application of negatively rotated SIS allows significantly lower slurry flow rates and/or shorter polishing times leading to more environmental friendly semiconductor manufacturing processes. Finally, it is confirmed that variations in SIS configuration has no impact on silicon dioxide to <b>silicon</b> nitride <b>removal</b> rate selectivity. In the fifth and final part of our study, the <b>silicon</b> dioxide <b>removal</b> rate using a "reverse" ceria-based slurry is investigated under four different combinations of conditioning modes and slurry application methods. In a “reverse” slurry, addition of water acts to promote material removal. Overall, the process using ex-situ conditioning with the SIS results in the highest removal rate, while the process using in-situ conditioning with the conventional point application (PA) generates the lowest removal rate. This study explains the differences in <b>silicon</b> dioxide <b>removal</b> rate based on the variations of the actual slurry dilution ratio on the pad associated with conditioning and slurry application methods. Frictional analysis and Stribeck+ curves are employed to elucidate the tribological characteristics. Results show that the conditioning modes and the slurry application methods vary the extent of the polishing vibrations. <b>Silicon</b> dioxide <b>removal</b> rate is found to linearly correlate with the extent of COF fluctuation.

The use of a ferric precipitation (flocculation) to remove the silicon has been tested using waste simulants.

In order to confirm the mathematical model, an industrial scale experiment on UMG-Si with an initial purity of 99. 98 wt. % was performed. Since the reaction temperature strongly influences both the evaporation and segregation of calcium, the dependences of effective segregation coefficient (keff) and the evaporation coefficient (kE) on temperature were carefully investigated.

Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) are chemically inert [1][2] and physically robust, which in addition to their minute size make them useful as reactive ion etch masks. We demonstrate that a 20 nm diameter MWCNT macromolecule can successfully be used as an etch mask in the selective reactive ion etch (RIE) of silicon to create high aspect ratio (5 - 15) silicon ridges with 100 - 300 nm tall vertical sidewalls, see Figure 1.

40|$|Iron {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the regulation of biological productivity and the carbon cycle of the Southern Ocean. Recently, synchrotron X-ray spectromicroscopy revealed that molar iron to silicon (Fe:Si) ratios in living diatom samples collected from surface waters and ice in the coastal Antarctic are significantly higher than reported dissolved Fe:Si ratios of Circumpolar Deep Water. Upwelling of Circumpolar Deep Water is a dominant source of iron and silicon to coastal Southern Ocean surface waters. Thus with higher Fe:Si ratios, diatom production preferentially depletes dissolved iron relative to silicon, potentially contributing to perennial iron limitation in this region. Combining diatom and water column dissolved iron and silicon datasets with a simple inverse box model we estimate the regional coupled iron and silicon budget. Upwelling of subsurface waters cannot supply enough iron to balance the loss due to diatom production, which indicates that the closed budget requires additional iron sources or additional methods of <b>silicon</b> <b>removal.</b> To evaluate the ecological and biogeochemical impacts of the high Fe:Si ratio, a three-dimensional ocean biogeochemistry and ecosystem model is used to simulate the sensitivity of ocean productivity and nutrient cycling to a wide range of Fe:Si ratios in modeled diatoms. The Fe:Si ratio of diatoms regulates the surface iron and macronutrient distribution in vast regions beyond the Southern Ocean. A globally higher Fe:Si ratio strongly decreases subpolar productivity and is partially compensated by the moderate increase in subtropical productivity. Our results indicate that the Fe:Si ratio of diatoms has a global impact controlling the distribution of both micro- and macro-nutrients and associated biological production. M. S...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{hydrometallurgical process}} for the {{treatment}} of ilmenite concentrates is developed, {{in order to reduce the}} silicon content to the maximum allowed value for the production of "grade B" ferrotitanium. The process was based on pressure leaching with sodium hydroxide and the effect of the main leaching parameters, namely the temperature, sodium hydroxide concentration and retention time, on the efficiency of <b>silicon</b> <b>removal</b> was studied. Caustic leaching of the ilmenite concentrates resulted in the removal of silicon, as well as of aluminum, without affecting the contents of titanium and iron. Leaching temperature and the retention time were proved as crucial parameters for the effective dissolution of silicon. Besides, these parameters affected directly the secondary precipitation of silicon and aluminum as a zeolitic phase, which polluted the treated ilmenite concentrate. Leaching kinetics determined the feasibility of the process, leading to the development of two optimized alternatives. The first alternative achieved the reduction of silicon and aluminum content to 0. 32 % and 0. 61 %, respectively, after 72 h leaching at 120 degrees C. This alternative necessitated a leached solids washing stage in order to separate the formed precipitate from the treated ilmenite concentrate. The second alternative achieved to reduce silicon and aluminum to 0. 29 % and 0. 59 %, respectively, after 1 h leaching at 200 degrees C, while avoided the formation of the secondary precipitate. Both alternatives achieved the selective leaching of silicon and aluminum without affecting titanium and iron content of the ilmenite concentrate. The applicability of each alternative is a matter of detailed technical and economic studies. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a series of}} studies pertaining to tribological, thermal, kinetic and slurry utilization aspects of chemical mechanical planaraization processes. The purpose of this work is to both develop a better method of characterizing the tribological mechanisms during polishing, as well as propose methods by which slurry utilization efficiency can be increased in order to minimize environmental hazards and operational costs associated with polishing without compromising the desired polish outcomes. The first study was conducted using {{a modified version of the}} generic Stribeck curve using real-time shear and down force data collection at 1, 000 Hz. This investigation served to provide a better understanding of the tribological and thermal mechanisms associated with polishing copper and tungsten blanket wafers on an industrially relevant soft pad. A multitude of gradual yet continuous changes in sliding velocity and polishing pressure were applied during polishing. Results indicated that polishing on the soft pad produced stable coefficient of friction (COF) values entirely within the "boundary lubrication" regime, while copper polishing on a hard pads produced a tremendous spread of data and resulted in both “boundary lubrication” and "mixed lubrication" regimes. In addition, the average pad surface temperature showed a linear relationship with the product of the COF, sliding velocity, and downward pressure for all copper and tungsten polishes on both soft and hard pads. Another study in this thesis investigated slurry availability and the extent of slurry mixing for three different slurry injection schemes. An ultraviolet enhanced fluorescence technique was employed to qualitatively measure slurry film thicknesses atop the pad surface during polishing. This study investigated standard pad-center point slurry dispensing and a slurry injection system (SIS) that covered only the outer half of the wafer track.

The effects of the DADMAC additive on the removal rates of the oxide films and their corresponding coefficients of friction (COFs) values were also investigated. Finally, the correlation between AFM force measurements, removal rates and COF values measured during polishing are discussed.

The solid SiO 2 mesa creates a wide dielectric for use in high impedance HARC.

In front end processing, CMP is used to realize shallow trench isolation (STI), to planarize trench capacitors in dynamic random access memories (DRAM) and in novel gate concepts. This thesis is focused on CMP for front end processing, which is the processing on the device level and the starting material. The effects of dopants, crystal orientation and process parameters on <b>silicon</b> <b>removal</b> rate are investigated. CMP and silicon wafer bonding is investigated. Also, plasma assisted wafer bonding to form InP MOS structures is investigated. A complexity of using STI in bipolar and BiCMOS processes is the integration of STI with deep trench isolation (DTI). A process module to realize STI/DTI, which introduces a poly CMP step to planarize the deep trench filling, is presented. Another investigated front end application is to remove the overgrowth in selectively epitaxially grown collector for a SiGe heterojunction bipolar transistor. CMP is also investigated for rounding, which could be beneficial for stress reduction or to create microoptical devices, using a pad softer than pads used for planarization. An issue in CMP for planarization is glazing of the pad, which results in a decrease in removal rate. To retain a stable removal rate, the pad needs to be conditioned. This thesis introduces a geometrically defined abrasive surface for pad conditioning...|$|E
40|$|GaN-based light {{emitting}} diodes (LEDs) and high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) grown on silicon substrates have the potential of low cost manufacturing for solid state lighting and power electronics. To fully explore the ultimate performance of the devices, a transfer process was developed to place the devices onto a potentially more suitable substrate for comparison of performance. In this research work, GaN-based LEDs and HEMTs grown on silicon substrates were transferred onto different substrates by a double-flip transfer process. Fabricated devices on the silicon substrate were bonded to a temporary substrate in the first flip. After the <b>silicon</b> <b>removal</b> by chemical etching, the devices were transferred to a new substrate as the second flip. LEDs on silicon were transferred to electroplated copper substrates with a reflective mirror inserted. The optical output power of LEDs on copper increased up to 114 %, as compared to those on the original silicon substrate before transfer. The significant improvement was attributed to {{the replacement of the}} light-absorbing silicon substrate with a mirror layer and better heat dissipation through the new copper substrate. LEDs on silicon were also successfully transferred onto flexible polyethylene-naphthalate (PEN) substrates. GaN-based LEDs on flexible substrate is a promising alternative to the current flexible organic LED displays. HEMT devices grown on silicon were transferred to copper substrates to improve the thermal conductivity, and hence reducing the self-heating effect on the devices during high power operation. The DC drain-source current (Ids) and transconductance (Gm) of the transistor were increased by about 25 % under the same gate bias after transfer to a copper substrate. The HEMTs were also transferred to a electrical insulating quartz substrate to investigate the effects on breakdown voltage and RF performance. However, no improvement on both breakdown and RF characteristics on the devices was observed after the substrate transfer process. This is due to the low breakdown voltage of the original devices grown on silicon and possibly poor thermal conductivity of the quartz substrate...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{guidelines for}} the deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) of silicon MEMS structures, employing SF 6 /O 2 -based high-density plasmas at cryogenic temperatures. Procedures of how to tune the equipment for optimal results with respect to etch rate and profile control are described. Profile control is a delicate balance between the respective etching and deposition rates of a SiOxFy passivation layer on the sidewalls and bottom of an etched structure {{in relation to the}} <b>silicon</b> <b>removal</b> rate from unpassivated areas. Any parameter that affects the relative rates of these processes has an effect on profile control. The deposition of the SiOxFy layer is mainly determined by the oxygen content in the SF 6 gas flow and the electrode temperature. Removal of the SiOxFy layer is mainly determined by the kinetic energy (self-bias) of ions in the SF 6 /O 2 plasma. Diagrams for profile control are given as a function of parameter settings, employing the previously published "black silicon method". Parameter settings for high rate silicon bulk etching, and the etching of micro needles and micro moulds are discussed, which demonstrate the usefulness of the diagrams for optimal design of etched features. Furthermore it is demonstrated that in order to use the oxygen flow as a control parameter for cryogenic DRIE, it is necessary to avoid or at least restrict the presence of fused silica as a dome material, because this material may release oxygen due to corrosion during operation of the plasma source. When inert dome materials like alumina are used, etching recipes can be defined for a broad variety of microstructures in the cryogenic temperature regime. Recipes with relatively low oxygen content (1 - 10 % of the total gas volume) and ions with low kinetic energy can now be applied to observe a low lateral etch rate beneath the mask, and a high selectivity (more than 500) of silicon etching with respect to polymers and oxide mask materials is obtained. Crystallographic preference etching of silicon is observed at low wafer temperature (- 120 °C). This effect is enhanced by increasing the process pressure above 10 mtorr or for low ion energies (below 20 eV) ...|$|E

40|$|The rapid {{development}} of photovoltaic industry is causing many researches on the refining of silicon, especially the purification of silicon by metallurgical method from the metallurgical-grade <b>silicon</b> (MG-Si). The <b>removal</b> of phosphorus and boron {{is one of}} the major problems on the refining of MG-Si to Solar-grade silicon (SoG-Si). At present, the removal method of phosphorous and boron by slagging of CaO-SiO 2 -CaF 2 and acid leaching treatment is being researched.

40|$|A {{recently}} described reaction for the UV-mediated attachment of alkenes to silicon surfaces is utilized as {{the basis}} for the preparation of functionalized silicon surfaces. UV light mediates the reaction of t-butyloxycarbonyl (t-BOC) protected ω-unsaturated aminoalkane (10 -aminodec- 1 -ene) with hydrogen-terminated <b>silicon</b> (001). <b>Removal</b> of the t-BOC protecting group yields an aminodecane-modified silicon surface. The resultant amino groups can be coupled to thiol-modified oligodeoxyribonucleotides using a heterobifunctional crosslinker, permitting the preparation of DNA arrays. Two methods for controlling the surface density of oligodeoxyribonucleotides were explored: in the first, binary mixtures of 10 -aminodec- 1 -ene and dodecene were utilized in the initial UV-mediated coupling reaction; a linear relationship was found between the mole fraction of aminodecene and the density of DNA hybridization sites. In the second, only a portion of the t-BOC protecting groups was removed from the surface by limiting the time allowed for the deprotection reaction. The oligodeoxyribonucleotide-modified surfaces were extremely stable and performed well in DNA hybridization assays. These surfaces provide an alternative to gold or glass for surface immobilization of oligonucleotides in DNA arrays as well as a route for the coupling of nucleic acid biomolecular recognition elements to semiconductor materials...|$|R
