5|$|Critics {{exploited}} the accident {{to undermine the}} IK-1 concept, with Bajdak joining those criticising the aircraft. The three flights were not considered sufficient to give a verdict on the design, and the debate over its future was fierce. This placed significant pressure on the designers, as every element of the aircraft design was subsequently attacked. Eventually, it was generally agreed that the aircraft was well-designed, but it needed more testing. At this point, Ikarus decided to build a second prototype, as {{it was evident that}} the hand-sewn fabric seam on the wing had not <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> strain of aerobatics, and their workmanship was in question. The second prototype took 10 months to build, with the two designers closely involved.|$|E

25|$|Grigore was an {{associate}} of the Germanophile administration set up by Lupu Kostaki in Bucharest, but moreover a confidant of the skeptical Conservative Alexandru Marghiloman. Together with Marghiloman and others, he <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Germans {{when it came to}} providing for civilian needs, such as when he procured firewood for the Bucharest populace. Reportedly, he also took a mediating position between Marghiloman, who remained respectful of King Ferdinand, and Petre P. Carp, who wanted the dynasty ousted and replaced.|$|E
25|$|Theravada Buddhist monks <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Rana {{regime and}} {{published}} books on Buddhism from India {{and brought them}} into Nepal.

In 1946, the ban on writing was lifted, and the monks were {{allowed to return to}} Nepal following international pressure. Their writings and public activities in Nepal Bhasa {{had a profound impact on}} the development of the language.|$|E

25|$|Thus the Spaniards {{pushed on}} {{for two days}} through the woods, streams and swamps, without a trail to follow. On {{the evening of the}} third day, September 19, Menéndez reached the {{neighborhood}} of the fort. The night was stormy and the rain fell so heavily that he thought he could approach it without being discovered, and encamped for the night in the pine grove {{on the edge of a}} pond within less than a quarter of a league from it. The spot he had chosen was marshy; in places the water <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> belts of the soldiers, and no fire could be lighted for fear of revealing their presence to the French.|$|E
25|$|Kala (Susanne Blakeslee) - If his woes {{become too}} great or his {{thoughts}} too burdensome, Tarzan seeks seclusion and the calm council of his gorilla mother, Kala. A sympathetic ear when Tarzan needs someone wise to talk to, Kala {{acts as the}} voice of the apes, always reminding Tarzan of his unique obligations to the family. She is also Jane's closest confidant. The two share a warm, strong bond, and Jane regards her mother-in-law as her only kindred spirit in the jungle. From Kala's point of view, Jane is the human daughter she never had. Kala was Kerchak's mate, and perhaps the only one besides Tarzan that ever openly defied him without repercussions. Her open mind is a well of great wisdom and she is almost always right. Even though Kerchak is gone, she is still highly respected. Although kind and motherly to Tarzan, Jane, and all the gorillas, Kala is almost undoubtedly the bravest gorilla in the family. When the family was trapped in a cave by Tublat, Kala bravely <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> villain, and encouraged all the other gorillas to be brave as well. Her presence and support keeps the family together and ensures that they are always there for each other even in the most dire situations.|$|E

500|$|Tallon's non-selection for the 1938 Ashes touring party {{surprised}} commentators. In selection deliberations, Bradman had {{lobbied for}} Tallon and Walker, asserting that Oldfield was past his best. The other two selectors, Chappie Dwyer from New South Wales and Bill Johnson from Victoria, outvoted Bradman. They selected Barnett, {{because of his}} previous tour to England, and Walker. Tallon's omission was overshadowed by that of Grimmett, regarded alongside Bill O'Reilly as the world's leading legspinner. No official reason was given for Tallon's non-selection. A leak revealed {{that the reason for}} his omission was that he was not familiar with the bowling of Australia's three spinners: O'Reilly, Chuck Fleetwood-Smith and Frank Ward. [...] Another was Tallon's preference in standing back to medium pacers. In reality, Tallon stood back and <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stumps depending on the situation. While the medium pacers were swinging the ball, he would stand back to avoid the risk of missing an edge. When the ball was old, he would stand up to the stumps when a medium pacer was operating and effect many stumpings with his fast reflexes.|$|E
500|$|The New York Times in 1966 wrote [...] "Russell's main {{characteristics}} are pride, intelligence, {{an active and}} appreciative sense of humor, a preoccupation with dignity, a capacity for consideration once his friendship or sympathy has been aroused, and an unwillingness to compromise whatever truths he has accepted." [...] Russell himself in 2009 wrote his paternal grandfather's motto, passed down to his father and thence to him is: [...] "A man has {{to draw a line}} inside himself that he won't allow any man to cross"; Russell was [...] "proud of my Grandfather's heroic dignity against forces more powerful than him... he would not allow himself to be oppressed or intimidated by anyone"; he wrote these words after recounting how that grandfather <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ku Klux Klan and whites who attempted to thwart his efforts to build a schoolhouse for black children (Jake Russell was the first person in Bill Russell's patrilineal line born free in North America, and was himself illiterate).

500|$|Dynamite Headdy {{received}} critical acclaim, {{with some}} believing {{it to be}} one of the best games on the Genesis. Journalists repeatedly highlighted the game's creativity as a strong point. Rik Skews of Computer and Video Games said it [...] "breathes new life" [...] into the action-platform genre and <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> likes of the Sonic series. The staff at Mean Machines Sega found the game innovative and liked how each stage introduced new concepts to keep gameplay fresh. Tim Tucker at GamesMaster believed that Treasure was doing more innovation in the genre than any of its rivals. In addition to the game's originality, critics praised Treasure's programming expertise and Dynamite Headdys technical prowess. The staff of Electronic Gaming Monthly complimented the game's visual effects and colorful stages. Tucker said [...] "Dynamite Headdy is full of classic Treasure overstatement" [...] and cited the impressive colors, big explosions, large sprites, and rapidly changing backgrounds—which all together were perhaps a little too overwhelming. The Mean Machines staff believed that Dynamite Headdy followed in the footsteps of Treasure's previous games and therefore confirmed the studio's technical expertise. The gameplay drew some criticism, with Tucker finding it somewhat disjointed and [...] "patchy" [...] and Mean Machines stating that it takes a few stages to truly find its footing.|$|E
500|$|Toshack was rested for {{the first}} tour match after the First Test against Northamptonshire, which Australia won by an innings. He {{returned}} against Yorkshire at Bramall Lane, Sheffield, making four as Australia batted first and scored 249. He then recorded the best innings analysis of his first-class career, taking 7/81 from 40 consecutive overs, bemusing the Yorkshire spectators with his Australian accent and distinctive [...] "Ow Wizz Ee" [...] appealing. He removed both openers, including Hutton, and then bowled Yorkshire and England captain Norman Yardley to leave the hosts at 3/107. After Yorkshire reached 4/149, Toshack took four more wickets as the hosts collapsed to be all out for 206. Wicket-keeper Ron Saggers <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wickets and stumped Ted Lester before Toshack removed three lower-order batsmen. Toshack did not bat or bowl again as the match petered into a draw. Bradman decided to bat until late on the third afternoon and secure a draw instead of pressing for a win; Yorkshire only batted for 27 overs in their second innings and the crowd booed Bradman for not pursuing a victory. With the match safe, Bradman elected to rely mainly on his second-choice bowlers to conserve his frontline bowlers' energy for the next Test.|$|E
500|$|Tallon had an {{understated}} style, {{which was}} without flourish or flamboyancy. He {{was known for}} his anticipation of the flight, length and spin of the ball. He was particularly regarded for his stumping efficiency and his ability to catch balls down the leg side. Tallon often <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stumps for medium pace bowlers and he had a textbook stumping technique in which he lifted the bails without disturbing the stumps. Tallon's crouch was more pronounced than most other keepers and he rebounded upwards further and faster than others. He had a particularly smooth and graceful catching technique that left his hands undamaged from the ball's impact, the injury in England in 1948 being a notable exception that proved the rule. In recognising him as one of their five Cricketers of the Year in the 1949 Wisden, the Almanack noted that his hands resembled those of a violinist, while Bradman noted that all his [...] "fine, longer fingers were intact" [...] as though he had not played much cricket. According to his English counterpart Godfrey Evans, Tallon was the [...] "best and most nimble keeper ever" [...] while Australian team-mate Alan Davidson called him the [...] "Bradman of keepers". Due to financial reasons, Tallon could not afford new equipment and he used an outdated pair of iron-coated gloves for most of his career.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1950s Britain was still {{attempting}} {{to remain a}} third major power on the world stage. This was [...] "the time when Britain <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States as strongly as she was ever {{to do in the}} postwar world". However, Churchill devoted much of his time in office to Anglo-American relations and attempted to maintain the Special Relationship.

2500|$|In {{the early}} 19th century {{engineer}} Theodore Burr, cousin of Aaron, having built {{one of the}} first significant crossings of the Hudson River at Waterford, turned his attentions to the Mohawk.
