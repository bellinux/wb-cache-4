Periosteum has two discrete layers: an outer fibrous layer and an inner cambial layer. The fibrous layer appears to be composed of fibroblastic cells in a collagen and elastin fibre matrix, along with a nerve and microvascular networks. The cambium layer is highly cellular and contains numerous cell types, including fibroblasts, osteoblasts, and osteochondral precursor cells. Mesenchymal precursor cells in the periosteum differentiate into neochondrocytes, producing cartilage tissue during embryogenesis and contributing to bone apposition during intramembranous ossification by differentiating into osteoblasts [15]. Because it can be transplanted as a whole tissue, it can serve as its own scaffold or a matrix onto which other cells and/or growth factors can adhere.

The experimental results show there was a linear relationship between pressure loss and flow rate. Combined with the Buckingham rheological equation, the computing equations of the yield shear stress and plastic viscosity were deduced through linear regression. A simple analytical method allowing for a rough estimation of the pumping pressure was proposed and used when considering the lubrication layer of wet shotcrete in pipes. In addition, two kinds of particulate distributive models were established along the time axial to analyze the formation of lubrication layer which is related with particles migration. By computational fluid dynamics simulation, the lubrication layer thickness of different mix proportions was estimated. A new method for measuring the thickness of lubrication layer was proposed to verify it by binarization processing. Finally, according to the comparative analysis of experiments, simulation and computed value, {{it can be seen that}} the lubrication layer plays a key role in the process of wet shotcrete flow and with the increase of lubrication layer thickness pipe pressure declines gradually.|$|E

A range of fibres percentages were added corresponding with the soil mass in a random distribution manner and the shear strength parameters were determined using unconsolidated undrained triaxial compression test method. The result proved that the fibre reinforced clayey soil has a relatively higher shear strength compared with the unreinforced clayey soil.

In the present work, {{the effect of the}} pocket on the heat transfer of endwall with a bluff body in the rear part of gas turbine is investigated. A simplified triangular pocket cavity is built in a rectangular channel and two bluff bodies, a cylinder or a cuboid is attached downstream on the endwall.

Liquid Crystal Thermography (LCT) is employed to measure the heat transfer over the pocket surface with Reynolds number ranging from 87, 597, to 218, 994. The turbulent flow details are provided by numerically calculations based on the commercial software Fluent 17. 0. Based on the results, high heat transfer areas are usually found at the boundary of the pocket cavity and vortex street shedding regions around the bluff body. When a pocket cavity is placed in the upstream of a bluff body, the endwall heat transfer around the bluff body is obviously decreased due to the disturbance by the pocket. There are no recirculating flows in front of the tested cylinder while this is not applicable for the cuboid case.

The evaluation step is based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process, in which the alternatives are inspected from functional suitability, source code, <b>support</b> <b>strength</b> and popularity. In more detail, under functionality suitability criterion, alternatives to open source software are evaluated in viewing of how much functionality can fit in with the functional user requirements.

The evaluation of <b>support</b> <b>strength</b> depends on the evaluation of field support and support resources. The field support includes commercial support and community support. The community support specifically refers to the direct responses from the community to the support requests.

40|$|At various {{intervals}} {{there have}} appeared on the American scene unique individuals whose ideals and principles have shaped the course of American history and the destiny of the American people. More often than not, they have appeared, as if providentially, in times of stress and turmoil, or at the least, during periods that were particularly decisive to the nation's history. Such individuals have always had certain characteristics in common. They were men of integrity and principle. They had a deep and abiding love for their country and an unfaltering faith in her future under a democratic system of government. They were men of vision whose ideas were usually {{far ahead of the}} times in which they lived. And they were not content merely to espouse their particular principles in theory alone, they also had the necessary devotion to duty to work tirelessly to make those ideals a reality, and the courage and fortitude to remain constant {{in the face of the}} adversity which they encountered in the process. Most of them had an empathy for the common man which transcended the normal sphere of interpersonal relationships and elevated it to the plane which recognizes the human kinship and brotherhood of all men. And finally, all of them left a legacy of ideas which are universally viable, and which serve as a constant source for the renewal of those ideals which are the foundation and <b>supporting</b> <b>strength</b> of the nation. In the days when the Republic was new, America was fortunate in having more than a few men of this caliber [...] men like Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Alexander Hamilton. And later, at decisive moments when the need was great, other men like Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, and Woodrow Wilson arose to lead their country and to plead the cause of liberalism and humanitarianism. Wendell Willkie was another such man. He believed in the integrity and worth of the individual, in his right to the basic human freedoms regardless of race, creed, or color, and in the ability of an enlightened citizenry to govern itself politically under a democratic system of government, and economically under the free-enterprise system. His contributions reflected these basic beliefs. At home he strove to lift American politics out of the realm of narrow, petty partisanship and expediency, and to elevate it to a system, regulated by high moral conduct, which would be responsive to the needs of the American people. In a broader sense, he fought imperialism both at home and abroad by working to establish those civil liberties which guarantee freedom, equal opportunity, and dignity to all human beings. He worked to rally the free world against the perils of a totalitarianism which threatened to destroy that freedom, and above all, to rally it in support of a system of international cooperation which not only would keep world peace, but also provide a forum where the brotherhood of man could become a reality. It is the purpose of this dissertation to examine the principles and ideals which guided Wendell Willkie's thinking and motivated his actions, to note the nineteenth-century background which fostered them, to follow the active crusade he made in their behalf, and finally, to summarize briefly the contribution of those ideals and principles to the American democratic system and to the concept of "one world.

Previous research on false memories has suggested that the mere claim from another person is enough to influence a target into reporting a false memory. The {{current research}} uses persuasion theory to suggest that the quality of the information that accompanies the memory claim influences the target 2 ̆ 7 s reporting of false memories. This dissertation includes 5 studies using a procedure based on the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm. The main goal of the studies is to examine how people use information in memory reports when making false memory judgments. Studies 1 and 2 provide evidence that false memories are more likely when memory claims are supported by strong rather than weak supporting information and that these results are not due to semantic priming or conformity. Study 3 replicates the findings of Studies 1 and 2 while demonstrating that the pattern of results depends on the supporting information being presented as support for a persuasive claim instead of simply being activated at the time of retrieval. Thus, Studies 1 [...] 3 provide strong support for persuasion effects on false memory. Studies 4 and 5 examine participants 2 ̆ 7 interpretations of supporting information under experimentally manipulated ability to process information. In Study 4, <b>support</b> <b>strength</b> again influences false memories, but does so across levels of cognitive load. In Study 5 source expertise has a marginal effect on false memories. However, the effects of source expertise and <b>support</b> <b>strength</b> do not differ by level of cognitive load. Thus, Studies 4 and 5 offer no consistent evidence as yet regarding whether the effects of <b>support</b> <b>strength</b> should be considered as due to support acting as arguments to support the claim or as information about the expertise or credibility of the source making the claim. In either case, the content of the support for the claim is influencing false memories. Future research may require some changes in methods to definitively answer such questions. Implications are discussed for effects of social influence on false memory within and beyond the DRM paradigm. ...|$|R
