[...] Along this style of reasoning, others explain that the turmoil of the Jewish diaspora is cause for loss of marital integrity amongst the greater Jewish population whereas the Kohanim are more apt at maintaining an above-average <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>integrity</b> for their spouses -thus the widow of a priest is permitted to the sons of Zadok.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "call to organization" [...] {{became the}} basis for the {{formation}} of the New York City Bar Association. The two hundred initial signatories of the document — all prominent New York attorneys — met to draft the Association’s constitution and bylaws on February 15, 1870 in a school house on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 28th Street. A year later, when the Association was legally incorporated, it had enrolled 493 members, representing nearly one in eight attorneys in New York City. Aside from the establishment of a law library, still considered the most comprehensive in the country, the Bar Association’s purpose, as stated in its constitution, was legal reform: “cultivating the science of jurisprudence, promoting reforms in the law, facilitating and improving the administration of justice, elevating the <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>integrity,</b> honor and courtesy in the legal profession, and cherishing the spirit of collegiality among the members thereof.” [...] Following the trials of the Tweed Ring, William M. Evarts, a well-known lawyer who had successfully defended President Andrew Johnson during his impeachment hearings and later served as Attorney General, was elected the Association’s first president, a post which he would hold for nine years. Samuel Tilden, a national political leader and an outspoken critic of government corruption, was elected vice president.|$|E
40|$|Real {{economic}} commitment (or {{the lack}} of it) of others affects a person's preferences to cooperate. But what if the commitment of others cannot be observed ex ante? Herein we examine how a classic non-monetary institution– a solemn oath of honesty –creates economic commitment within the public goods game. Commitment-through-the-oath asks people to hold themselves to a higher <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>integrity.</b> Our results suggest the oath can increase cooperation (by 33 %) – but the oath does not change preferences for cooperation. Rather people react quicker and cooperate, taking less time to ponder on the strategic free riding behavior...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) -University of Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2003. The debate {{surrounding}} whether genuine moral dilemmas {{exist or}} is a longstanding one. Proponents {{of the existence}} of genuine moral dilemmas like Ruth Barcan Marcus and Bernard Williams have appealed to the moral residue argument as a means of proving that moral dilemmas exist. Opponents like WaIter SinnottArmstrong, Patricia Greenspan, and Terence McConnell, however, have denied its efficacy on the basis that the moral residue argument begs the question on two counts: Firstly, by assuming that rationally irresolvable conflicts of commitments exist, and secondly, by assuming that agents who experience moral residue have necessarily done something wrong. I argue in this thesis that there is a way that the moral residue argument can be salvaged and provide a more precise account of appropriate moral residue - an account that simultaneously overcomes the objections. Specifically, I argue that the moral residue argument, when interpreted in terms ofthe independent <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>integrity,</b> can provide an account of appropriate moral residue that can explain what the agent has done wrong, and that is neither too strict nor overlooks the fact ofthe agent's harsh self-assessment and moral residue. In so doing I show how the specific accounts of appropriate moral residue assumed in the objections are flawed and miss the force of the point about moral residue. By examining two case studies - Williams Styron's Sophie 's Choice, and Euripides' Jphigenia at Aulis - I show that it can be established independently that both Sophie and Agamemnon do something wrong and would do something wrong no matter how they acted in their respective situations. Through Lynn McFall's conception of integrity I show that Sophie and Agamemnon would undermine their integrity regardless ofwhich oftheir alternative they chose to act on. In so doing I establish that their moral residue is appropriate and would be appropriate had they acted on their other alternative. By this means I demonstrate how - when interpreted in terms of the independent <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>integrity</b> - the moral residue argument can support the existence of genuine moral dilemmas...|$|E
30|$|The quality <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>integrity</b> of {{information}} technology (IT) systems aims to guarantee that the information is modified and destroyed only by authorized parties, is modified and destroyed only in authorized ways, and {{is assumed to be}} authentic, (i.e., authorized parties can be verified), and any change {{of information}} cannot be repudiated (i.e., cannot be denied by the authorized changing party). There exist several measures to provide end-to-end data integrity. These measures include installation of antivirus programs, establishing authenticity and non-repudiation protocols, applying “check-sum” procedures, and installation of system and data recovery utility software programs. Malware is a common root cause of data corruption, and it can cause intentional or unintentional loss of data integrity. A virus also alters files and renders an information system unusable. A “check-sum” procedure can be used to detect and correct possible data corruption. Other programs can repair the corrupted file automatically, depending on the level of corruption. In more extreme cases, when data seems to be uncorrectable, one can apply automatic restoration from backups.|$|E
40|$|When Nevada legalized gaming in 1931, few {{observers}} {{could have}} predicted {{the extent to which}} the gaming industry would grow and evolve. The modern gaming industry has expanded across the globe, and is now regarded as a dynamic avenue of commerce. However, during the industry’s infancy, many Americans denounced gaming as a pariah. Legalized gaming was not viewed as a legitimate industry; rather, it was a haven for swindlers and cheaters. How did Nevada turn this negative perception into a positive one? Legislators and regulators resolved to create and enforce gaming regulations with the highest standards of ethics and integrity, and in doing so, they established the model jurisdiction for the gaming industry. One Nevadan epitomized this integrity during his thirty years of public service: Richard H. Bryan. This article explores Bryan’s exemplary political career, which included terms as a Nevada state assemblyman, senator, attorney general, governor, and United States senator. Throughout his career, Bryan was a stalwart champion of the Nevada gaming industry against opposition within the state and in the federal government. By helping the gaming industry conquer obstacles and avoid the pitfalls of impropriety, Bryan was keeping it clean. Thus, this article will demonstrate that Bryan set the gold <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>integrity</b> for the Nevada gaming control system...|$|E

40|$|What {{does it mean}} to be authentic? Is {{authenticity}} {{an attribute}} of the individual, or do certain environmental factors facilitate or inhibit the enactment of the authentic self? This research proposes that authentic behavior is the subjective perception that one is behaving in a way that is in accordance with his or her core being. As such, sense of authenticity is considered an important component of the self. I present a theoretical model of the relationship between authenticity and the need for social approval. I analyze the reports of 194 survey respondents and interview data from 21 interviews. These quantitative and qualitative analyses suggest that individuals engage in authentic and inauthentic behavior for a variety of reasons. Specifically, three different behavioral motivations have been identified: (1) behavior motivated by pursuit of the greater social good or for purposes of social cohesion, (2) behavior motivated by pursuit of instrumental gains, and (3) behavior motivated by an internal <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>integrity.</b> Demographic variables and psychological variables were also found to be important determinants of authentic behavior. Blacks reported lower need for social approval than whites, and subsequently higher reports of authentic behavior. Self-esteem emerged in the analyses as a powerful predictor of authentic behavior. In tandem, these results suggest that it may not be one's level of social power that determines his or her ability to behave in ways deemed authentic, but rather one's sense of freedom and confidence in oneself.
