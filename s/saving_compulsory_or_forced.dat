In addition, widows were in general allowed to remarry by community elders, i.e. the [...] "Moti Naat" [...] and the [...] "Community Panch", on a case to case basis {{for more than two}} centuries - much before the Widow Remarriage Act was brought into British India in 1856. The word used for such widow remarriage was [...] "Ghar-gharana". Even the young widows having infants were also allowed to remarry in case the second husband guaranteed to take care of child born from first marriage. There was a word called [...] "agandiyaat" [...] used for the young boy which came to his stepfather's house holding the finger of its mother. The word [...] "angadi" [...] in Gujarati language means finger and [...] "angadiyaat" [...] means the one who has come holding the finger. Sometimes, when the family of first husband, wished that son born from her first marriage should carry the name and title or surname of his deceased father, such arrangements were also given.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Compulsory</b> <b>or</b> <b>forced</b> sterilizations and abortions {{may also}} {{occur in the}} context of {{population}} control policies.From the 1970s to 1980s, tension grew between women's health activists who advance women's reproductive rights as part of a human rights-based approach on the one hand, and population control advocates on the other. At the 1984 UN World Population Conference in Mexico City population control policies came under attack from women's health advocates who argued that the policies' narrow focus led to coercion and decreased quality of care, and that these policies ignored the varied social and cultural contexts in which family planning was provided in developing countries. In the 1980s the HIV/AIDS epidemic forced a broader discussion of sex into the public discourse in many countries, leading to more emphasis on reproductive health issues beyond reducing fertility. The growing opposition to the narrow population control focus led to a significant departure in the early 1990s from past population control policies. [...] In the United States, abortion opponents have begun to foment conspiracy theories about reproductive rights advocates, accusing them of advancing a racist agenda of eugenics, and of trying to reduce the African American birth rate in the U.S.|$|R

40|$|Magister Legum - LLMFor many, {{the human}} rights which South Africa {{has been able to}} secure for LGBTI (lesbian, gay, bisexual, {{transgender}} and intersex) people has been very progressive. However, with the conflation of sexual orientation and gender identity, the assumption of access to human rights for all within the LGBTI and society at large, has led to transsexual people not being able to claim their rights and assert their existence as human beings effectively within our constitutional democracy. Currently, there is a vacuum in South Africa's law of marriage based on its inability to accommodate spouses who married as a 'heterosexual' couple but where the one spouse subsequently undergoes gender affirmation, conforming the relationship to what is perceived as 'homosexual'. On account of this, the Department of Home Affairs are subjecting these couples to <b>compulsory</b> <b>or</b> <b>forced</b> divorces by refusing to have the transsexual spouse recognised within his or her affirmed gender on the marriage certificate. This means that the transsexual spouse either remains married under the Marriage Act and is subject to being recognised as his or her birth-sex, or submits to a <b>compulsory</b> <b>or</b> <b>forced</b> divorce in order to be recognised as his or her affirmed sex on a marriage certificate issued under the Civil Union Act upon them 'remarrying'. This thesis addresses the inequalities and inequities brought about by the Marriage Act. It investigates the history of marriages within South Africa that were prohibited based on characteristics such as race which people have no control over. It looks at how the State, through its departments, has imposed itself on the social relationships people formed subject to its legal terms and conditions. This thesis questions whether the State through its action is acting {{in a way that is}} administratively just. It argues that the successfulness of a divorce decree is dependent on at least one party voluntary applying for it. This presupposes the idea that whenever couples who are validly married are <b>forced</b> <b>or</b> compelled to divorce one another that this, in fact, cannot be seen as one of the valid ways in which to obtain a divorce decree legally. Before venturing into the legal aspect concerning this research topic, a theoretical framework will be advanced to position these couples in a greater social context. Subsequently, in order to establish the legal position of these couples, this thesis will draw on the current South African human rights discourse that has been developed by and for the LGBTI community, especially as it relates to the law of marriage. It will also establish the international and foreign human rights discourses that assert or, at least, seek to assert LGBTI human rights broadly. Ultimately, a constitutional analysis will be conducted to establish the position of these couples under the Marriage Act...|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} devoted to the {{institution}} of a delay in the norms of the criminal, criminal procedure and the Criminal Executive laws. Branch manifold delay is due to its ability to flexibly and pragmatically consider features arisen life situations that allows to optimize the execution process of any decision. At present the Institute of deferral is actively used as a tool of individualization and differentiation of responsibility, and the means of the humanization of punishment. A major finding in the present article is the proposition that deferral of service of sentence is interdisciplinary institution through which to solve important problems (personal problems, deliverance from suffering newborns or young children, enabling the primary socialization of young children). Comparative analysis of the norms of these branches of law allowed to reveal some contradictions and gaps. The article suggests to extend the ban of destination correctional, <b>compulsory</b> <b>or</b> <b>forced</b> labor for prisoners - men, which are the only parents of {{children under the age of}} 3 years. The article draws attention to the branch peculiarities of regulation of deferral. In the criminal law directly provides for such the deferral species as the deferral of service of sentence pregnant women and convicted with small children and to delay sentence drug addicts. In the article sums up point of view about that the provision under Part 4 of Art. 81 of the Criminal Code, on temporary exemption from punishment due to illness until recovery convicted by its content virtually is also a deferral of service of sentence...|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the {{administrative}} feasibility of monitoring mechanisms implementations in Hamedan province. Recognizing, formulating and ranking appropriate mechanisms were another objective of the study. Approach: This study was a descriptive survey research and the statistical population of the study included staff and executive experts that involved in related to agricultural development organizations of Hamedan. The all of statistical population were selected and studied. Data collection was accomplished by using questionnaires were filled out using interviews with the participants. The questionnaire was validated by a 5 member panel of experts and its reliability was confirmed through pre-test of data tool and Cronbach Alpha. In total, 210 questionnaires were filled out using interviews with the participants. Two statistical techniques were also used to analyze data. Coefficient of variance was used in order to determine priority of different mechanisms about resource conservation. Mann-Whitney technique utilized for assessing agreement of experts perceptions. Results: Results of different mechanisms ranking show that four of them placed from first to fourth orders with a low coefficient of variance. These mechanisms were: Codification of appropriate rules and regulations, resources conservation police establishment, integrated systems of permission and utilization licenses, polluters pays surcharge. Results from agreement assessment revealed that both staffs experts and executive perceptions agreed with 12 mechanisms because variation coefficient was low for these 12 mechanisms, some command and control mechanisms implementation in the study area are unfeasible (resources conservation police establishment (Sig = 0. 032), encounter versus invasive of natural resources (Sig = 0. 022), monitoring of technology application standards (Sig = 0. 042) and tradable rights (permits) for resource utilization (Sig = 0. 033). The mechanisms which had a view of external control were not agreed with experts and had no priority. Conclusion: Therefore, using <b>compulsory</b> <b>or</b> <b>forced</b> mechanisms expect to have the less possibility of success in order to conserve basic resources of agricultural sector product. It can be expected that those mechanisms which had high priority will contribute to agricultural related organizations when they intend to apply resource conservations strategies...|$|R
