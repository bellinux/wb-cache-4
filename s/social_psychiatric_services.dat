In this research, sixty-three social workers in various <b>psychiatric</b> <b>services</b> were interviewed. Their perception and activities in providing psychotherapy were analysed. The findings showed that they had different perceptions on psychotherapy. In day-to-day practice they infrequently provide psychotherapy. They {{did not have enough}} competence, knowledge and skills in providing psychotherapy. They tended to believe in popular westernised models of psychotherapy without questioning their applicability within the Hong Kong Chinese cultural context.

This paper is an account of an original research on the counselling role of <b>social</b> workers in <b>psychiatric</b> <b>services</b> in Hong Kong. In this research, 63 social workers in various <b>psychiatric</b> <b>services</b> were interviewed. Their perception and activities in this role were analysed. The findings show that this role was frequently performed and supported by their agencies, the policy and the public. Unfortunately, activities in this role were highly task- and problem-oriented, with insufficient theoretical and professional backup. Finally, counselling was delivered in the forms of brief advice on patients' immediate problem. Department of Applied Social Science...|$|R

Zur Prävention psychischer Erkrankungen entwickelten die Praxis für Kunst und Psychotherapie Haan und der Sozialpsychiatrische Dienst Hilden ein Hilfsangebot für Familien mit minderjährigen Kindern, in denen ein oder beide Elternteile an einer endogenen Psychose oder einer schweren Persönlichkeitsstörung leiden. Die beiden Initiatoren des Projekts KIPKEL beschreiben ihre Erfahrungen in der Vorbereitungsphase, bei der Sicherung der Finanzierung und beim Aufbau verläßlicher Kooperationsstrukturen. Die konzeptionellen Grundlagen und die Probleme ihrer praktischen Umsetzung werden dargestellt. Abschließend veranschaulicht ein Fallbeispiel die komplexe Beziehungsgestaltung mit einer teilnehmenden Familie und den Verlauf der Betreuungsarbeit.

40|$|Finns ejThe aim of {{this study}} is to {{describe}} the experiences of children’s social workers in Sweden who work with families in which a parent suffers from serious mental illness, and how a child in such a family receives support. Data were collected through individual interviews and focus groups discussions with 13 professionals in 2 minor municipalities in southern Sweden. Interviewees stated that parental serious mental illness was not a main focus for children’s social workers. When parental serious mental illness became a barrier to caring for their children, the children’s social workers sought to collaborate with <b>psychiatric</b> <b>services,</b> but in many cases it did not turn out well. Providing support to the parent was one way of aiding the family, although at the price of setting the child’s perspective aside. Being faced with responsibility for the parent and the child left children’s social workers feeling they were the last outpost for the families. Children’s social workers require greater knowledge of how to handle parental serious mental illness, and more interagency collaboration with <b>psychiatric</b> <b>services</b> is needed to adequately support children of parents with a serious mental illness.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>social</b> variables and <b>psychiatric</b> <b>service</b> use in Victoria was investigated using a social indicators approach. Indicators were developed separately for the {{urban and rural}} areas of the state using 1986 census data. Principal components analysis was employed to reduce the data. Simple, unit weight indicators were developed and explained a considerable proportion of the variation in the rate of persons admitted to psychiatric facilities, the rate of admission episodes and the rate of occupied bed days for urban areas; a moderate amount of variation for these measures was accounted for by indicators developed for rural areas. The findings were considered in relation to both methodological issues and the role of other factors (e. g., accessibility and availability of <b>psychiatric</b> <b>services)</b> which may contribute to service use...|$|R
40|$|A {{good quality}} of life (QoL) can be {{regarded}} as the ultimate goal of psychiatric treatment and rehabilitation. The objective of the present thesis was to study the how the QoL of patients with schizophrenia was related to their social functions and varying <b>social</b> environments. <b>Psychiatric</b> <b>services</b> have undergone major changes in the last 50 years, from an asylum-based model to community psychiatry, radically changing the social environment of patients with schizophrenia. The first paper focused on the effects of deinstitutionalization on QoL, and showed that patients in four living habitats in the city of Malmö (hospital wards, treatment collectives, group homes, apartments of their own) did not differ in self-rated QoL. However, we found evidence suggesting that the patients, and in particular those with predominantly negative symptoms, were unable to assess their QoL by the measurement instrument used (QLS- 100). In the second paper, we found that self-monitoring problems of schizophrenic patients was linked to cognitive impairments rather than to the presence of negative symptoms. In the third paper, we found that the social functions of even the most severely disabled patients with schizophrenia could be improved by social skills training. In paper four, data from a case-finding study of schizophrenia in the city of Malmö (population 250 000; 1344 schizophrenic patients were identified) were combined with data from a sociological study of the self-reported sense of security and social organisation in the local domicile involving 7 000 randomly selected inhabitants. The prevalence of schizophrenia was particularly high in areas with high levels of social disorganization and unsafety, which may further detract form the QoL of these patients...|$|R

40|$|There is some {{evidence}} {{in the literature of}} increased demand on health services by adults with psychiatric morbidity. Among people over retirement age these associations appear weaker. Results from three independent, but comparable, surveys of elderly people living in London and Essex are presented in relation to their use of health and <b>social</b> <b>services.</b> <b>Psychiatric</b> morbidity was found to be a poor predictor of service use. Level of functional ability and, in some cases, age were both stronger predictors of use of a selection of these services among the two samples from the urban area. Age was a stronger predictor of use of home help and meals on wheels services among the younger urban sample aged 65 – 85. The model had little explanatory power in relation to use of general practitioner services. The study also indicated that the semi-rural sample had better reported health status and functional ability than the samples in the urban area. Use of health and social services was also lower in the semi-rural areas...|$|R

General practitioners in all areas wanted more consultation with psychiatrists, and 53 - 68 % wanted regular psychiatric outpatient clinics in their surgeries. There was enthusiasm for community psychiatric nurses and for help with psychotherapy. In the rural area general practitioners favoured surgery based psychiatric outpatient clinics and arranging emergency hospital admissions themselves; in urban areas domiciliary visits from psychiatrists to help with emergencies were favoured. These results appear to reflect the greater geographical distance between primary and hospital based secondary care in rural as opposed to urban areas. Overall, general practitioners wanted more support from community <b>psychiatric</b> <b>services</b> in carrying out their primary therapeutic role especially in rural areas far from hospital-based <b>psychiatric</b> <b>services...</b>|$|R
