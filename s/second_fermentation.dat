5|$|The crémant {{produced}} in the Languedoc is made according to the Méthode Traditionnelle - formerly known as méthode champenoise, the same method used to produce the Champagne, including a <b>second</b> <b>fermentation</b> in the bottle to encapture the carbon dioxide produced by the yeast - in the small villages around the town of Limoux. The wines are normally composed of 70% Mauzac and a 30% combination of Chardonnay and Chenin blanc. AOC regulations require a year of aging on the lees. The Blanquette de Limoux, when labelled méthode ancestrale, is composed entirely of Mauzac, undergoes only one fermentation and is aged approximately three months less on the lees before the bottling, the actual date being determined by the moon's cycle.|$|E
25|$|The wine is {{fermented}} once on {{the barrel}} and then undergoes a <b>second</b> <b>fermentation</b> in the bottle after the addition of yeast, nutrients for the yeast, and sugar (known as tirage). The <b>second</b> <b>fermentation</b> results in a natural sparkling wine. Yeast precipitate (lees) must then be removed. This begins with riddling (remuage in French) {{which means that the}} bottles are turned with the neck downwards and lightly shaken to move the lees to the neck of the bottle. This is done in small steps where the bottle orientation gradually changes. Finally the inverted bottle necks are cooled so that the precipitation freezes to a small block of ice, the bottles are turned upright and the temporary closure (normally a crown cap) is opened so that the precipitate is pushed out by the pressure in the bottle. Then the bottle is filled to replace the missing volume, and fitted with a plain Champagne cork and halter. The process to remove lees is called disgorging.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} sugar (dosage) added after the <b>second</b> <b>fermentation</b> and aging varies and will dictate the {{sweetness}} {{level of the}} sparkling wine. Wines produced within the European Union must include the sweetness level on the wine label.

50|$|This led him {{to create}} the wort {{stabilisation}} process, {{which resulted in a}} clearer and consistent wort. He then separated the fermentation into stages.

As a result, Coutts created a continuous flow between the two fermentation processes.|$|R
50|$|The first {{fermentation}} {{begins in}} the same way as any wine, converting the natural sugar in the grapes into alcohol while the resultant carbon dioxide is allowed to escape. This produces the base wine. This wine is not very pleasant by itself, being too acidic. At this point the blend, known as the cuvée, is assembled, using wines from various vineyards, and, in the case of non-vintage wine, various years.After primary fermentation, blending (assemblage in Champagne) and bottling, a <b>second</b> alcoholic <b>fermentation</b> occurs in the bottle.|$|R

25|$|The {{production}} of Champagne and many sparkling wines requires a <b>second</b> <b>fermentation</b> {{to occur in}} the bottle in order to produce the carbonation necessary for the style.

40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} is aimed at {{determining}} the performance of an amylolytic Lactobacillus plantarum MSUL 702 for lactic acid production from the repeated-batch and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) of a synthetic cassava starch wastewater (SCW). An ability of the bacteria to treat the SCW in terms of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) removal efficiencies was also investigated during the fermentation processes. The SSF experiments were performed for five consecutive batches under a non-sterile condition and at a room temperature. The highest lactic acid concentration and viable lactic acid bacteria at 28. 71 g/L and 9. 26 log CFU/mL, respectively, were obtained in the 48 h of the first batch fermentation.

25|$|After {{the end of}} {{fermentation}}, {{the wine}} may also have malolactic fermentation or FML. This <b>second</b> <b>fermentation</b> carried out by bacteria deacidifies the wine: it transforms the malic acid, which has two carboxyl groups, into lactic acid. This operation, which reduces the biting acidity of the wine, is not always desirable nor practiced. In southern areas the acidity is carefully preserved to give the wine its liveliness for refreshing Aroma of wine. During the fermentation of the grapes varietal aromas are reduced in favour {{of an increase in}} roundness and volume in the mouth of the wine during ageing in oak barrels.

25|$|A {{beverage}} {{that clearly}} {{made its debut}} during the 17th century was sparkling champagne. The credit for that development goes primarily and erroneously to Dom Perignon, the wine-master in a French abbey.

Around 1668, Perignon used strong bottles, invented a more efficient cork (and one that could contain the effervescence in those strong bottles), and began developing the technique of blending the contents. However, another century would pass before problems, especially bursting bottles, would be solved and champagne would become popular.|$|E

30|$|Bioethanol, biomethanol, biodiesel, etc. {{known as}} {{biofuels}} are an {{alternative energy source}} that will likely become more prevalent in the future (Nigam and Singh 2011).

Bioethanol from cellulose, is therefore a very promising avenue of biofuel as it does not compete with food products (Kemppainen and Shonnard 2005; Sticklen 2008).

Different vegetable substrates are nowadays used to obtain healthy plant-based probiotics. We report here a comparative analysis of lactic acid using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and by Senzytec Biosensor evaluation, from 6 samples of apple pulps and/or peels, spontaneously fermented for 7 and 14 days. After 7 days of fermentation the quantity of lactic acid is higher, dependent on the substrate, better fermentations on pulp-containing samples and on apple variety (best fermentations on Golden apple substrate). In the <b>second</b> stage <b>fermentation</b> (14 days) a general decrease of organic acids (both malic and lactic acids) was noticed, but the ratio malic:lactic acid decreased also, comparing with the first fermentation stage. These data indicates the preferential consumption of malic acid by lactic bacteria into their metabolic pathways. The combined apple substrate (pulp and peel) proved to be a very good substrate for producing lactic acid. The lactic concentrations obtained by HPLC were generally higher than those obtained by biosensor measurements. The differences between HPLC values and Tectronik Senzytec Biosensor values of lactic acid were nit significant, but dependent on the range of concentrations (from 20 to 200 mg/ml).

Glucose concentration of 45 g/l in YNB supported high X. dendrorhous growth and astaxanthin production, with astaxanthin production of 9010 mug/l was observed during the first stage, Although the red yeast produced more astaxanthin with peptone as nitrogen source during the first stage, YNB supported the highest extractability of carotenoid and lytic activity of B. circulans in the <b>second</b> stage of <b>fermentation.</b> The optimal pH and temperature for pigment extraction in the mixed culture were pH 6. 5 and 30 - 34 degreesC respectively.

[...] Some of these [...] "other qualities" [...] {{may have been a}} slight fizziness that was a by product of wine making techniques that emerged during the late Middle Ages. At the time various wine faults would plague unstable Chiantis because they were not able to fully complete fermentation and yeast cells would remain active in the wine. The lack of full fermentation was partly due to cooler temperatures following harvest that stuns the yeast and prohibits activity but could have also been caused by unsanitary fermentation vessels. In the 14th century, Chianti winemakers developed a technique known as governo where half-dried grapes are added to the must to stimulate the yeast with a fresh source of sugar that may keep the yeast active all the through the fermentation process. While this technique did improve the probability of a fully fermenting wine, the <b>second</b> <b>fermentation</b> caused by the addition of the new sugars also left some carbon dioxide caused the wines to have a slightly sparkling or [...] "fizzy" [...] character.|$|E

After fermentation the base wines are then blended to form a cuvee. While there are examples of varietal sparkling wines, such as blanc de blancs (white of whites) made from 100% Chardonnay, most sparkling wines are blends of several grape varieties, vineyards and vintages. Producers with wide access to grapes will use wines from several hundred base wines to create a blend that reflect the [...] "house style" [...] of their non-vintage wine.
