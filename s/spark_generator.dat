This dissertation explores the green, flexible, and scalable spark discharge process for the fabrication of complex nanostructured materials, and the application of said materials in energy devices. A novel <b>spark</b> <b>generator</b> concept with a 60 -fold increased mass production rate was developed, where spark energy and spark repetition rate have been decoupled from gas and material properties. The application of spark discharge materials in two types of energy storage and conversion devices was studied: amorphous-Si photovoltaic cells, MgH 2 -based hydrogen storage. The possibility of using spark discharge to functionalize nanoparticles with metal coatings was investigated using two spark generators in series. The new <b>spark</b> <b>generator</b> provides true scaling: it produces materials identical to that of the old designs, and the mass production rate – about a gram per day – scales linearly with the spark repetition rate. Arrays of ? 100 nm high-purity silver nanospheres were deposited as scattering agents in solar cells, improving their external quantum efficiency by 30 %. A method for synthesizing MgH 2 nanoparticles was developed, which show promising hydrogen storage properties. Nanocomposites of Mg with NbOx catalyst nanoparticles were synthesized using two sparks in series, increasing the H 2 desorption rate of MgH 2. Using a hollow electrode spark, 40 nm gold nanoparticles were coated with silver, and vice versa.

40|$|AbstractDuring {{these last}} years, the {{evolution}} of the machining speed of the EDM processes has become a key challenge for this technology. The recent progress made on the <b>spark</b> <b>generators</b> leads to a higher production speed in all processes such wire EDM, die-sinking, drilling, milling, etc. Nevertheless, if the electrical process is developing fast, many limiting factors still remain under investigations. In this context, our group started 7 years ago a research program to increase the understanding of the EDM particle hydrodynamics. We describe in this paper some results obtained and discuss the physical aspects related to the evacuation of the machining debris. During the EDM process, if the cleaning of the dielectric is not effective and some debris remain in the gap, the electrical resistance is locally reduced and the spark occurs at the same place. The process cannot go farther. In this situation, i. e. when the spark frequency and power are high enough, the machining speed is governed mainly by hydrodynamics. In this paper we will present efficient strategies to clean the gap in the wire EDM (part 1) and die sinking processes (part 2). For the wire EDM process (part 1), we have designed and analysed dielectric injection nozzles with the aim of improving the cleaning processes in the gap. Three main tools have been used to achieve this goal. The first is a fluid flow simulation model using CFD solvers. Then, the results have been validated using experimental techniques at full scale on EDM machines. Finally, a test rig has been developed and experimental analyses have been done...|$|R
40|$|Soot {{particles}} are {{a product of}} the incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. They influence our climate directly and indirectly, which makes them an important constituent of the atmospheric aerosol. Model calculations imply that soot aerosol may {{have a significant impact on}} the oxidation capacity of the troposphere and on the nitrogen oxides and ozone chemistry of the stratosphere. One goal of this work was the investigation of the decomposition/reduction rates of the trace gases O_ 3, NO_ 2, N_ 2 O_ 5 /NO_ 3 and HOONO_ 2 /HO_ 2 on airborne soot particles at atmospherically relevant temperatures and trace gas concentrations in the aerosol chamber AIDA. After a rapid initial loss of about one monolayer equivalent of ozone the reaction probability drops to #gamma# #approx# 10 "-" 6. This value of #gamma# is at least three orders of magnitude lower than had been assumed in the model calculations. Therefore, the decomposition of ozone on soot aerosol is negligible both in the troposphere and in the stratosphere. It also turned out that the reaction probabilities of the other investigated trace gases fall several orders of magnitude short of the lower limits above which model calculations predicted a significant influence of soot aerosol on the oxidation capacity of the atmosphere. Volatilisation by oxidative trace gases can be used to remove soot deposits from catalytic converters. Therefore, another goal of this work was the determination of reaction probabilities for the oxidation of soot by O_ 3 and NO_ 2. The volatilisation rate of soot particles exposed to 1 % of ozone in air can already be measured at room temperature. However, the process is completely negligible in the atmosphere because oxidation times of several thousand years would result, depending on temperature and particle size, at a mixing ratio of 100 ppb ozone. Under the conditions of a Diesel catalytic converter (350 C, 500 ppm NO_ 2) soot {{particles are}} volatilised by NO_ 2 within 3 hours. To interpret these results ESR spectra of loosely deposited <b>spark</b> <b>generator</b> soot and Diesel soot particles were investigated. Partial oxidation of <b>spark</b> <b>generator</b> soot results in a reduction of the ESR line intensity at g 2. 003, in parallel with the soot mass reduction, while the intensity of a weak shoulder at g = 2. 0015 changes insignificantly. As a consequence the ESR spectrum of <b>spark</b> <b>generator</b> soot becomes more and more similar to that of Diesel soot, which consists of two lines at g = 2. 0039 and g = 2. 0020 of comparable intensities. We conclude from a comparison of high resolution TEM micrographs that the two lines can be assigned to different domains of the soot particles, one domain being significantly less reactive than the other.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a study of}} the minimum ignition energy (MIE) of easily ignitable dust clouds in air. The MIE is a central parameter when assessing the risk involved when handling combustible dusts. Current standard test apparatus for determining MIE of dust clouds has a lower energy limit in the range of 1 - 3 mJ, which is a quite severe limitation because many dusts ignite readily at this energy level. Thus, the true MIE remains unknown for a number of easily ignitable dusts. A new <b>spark</b> <b>generator,</b> capable of producing synchronised sparks of very low energies and with an integrated system for measuring spark energy, has therefore been developed and applied to a number of ignition sensitive dusts. The experiments showed that several dusts did in fact have MIEs 1 - 2 orders of magnitude lower than 1 mJ. The new <b>spark</b> <b>generator</b> may therefore offer a basis for developing a standard test apparatus in the low-energy region. An investigation of a possible spark triggering mechanism that may take place in industrial practice has also been performed, and using this method, MIEs of several dusts were determined. Unlike the conventional method for determining MIE in the laboratory, the delay between dust dispersion and spark discharge was not a degree of freedom. In stead, the transient dust cloud was used to initiate spark breakdown between electrodes set at a high voltage lower than breakdown in pure air. As would be expected, the MIEs found by this method were somewhat higher than those obtained using conventional methods. This was ascribed to the non-optimal conditions for ignition at sparkover, which is believed to be closer to the mechanism of accidental electrostatic spark initiation in an industrial plant. There optimal independent dust dispersion and artificial spark triggering is not a realistic scenario. However, even when using this non-optimal method of spark triggering, MIEs below 1 mJ were found...|$|E

The transition to H-mode occurred at high magnetic fields when the arc formed a loop. An equivalent circuit for the set-up is proposed in order to assess the relative importance of the forces involved in the curvature of the arc (Lorentz force and drag force).

The originally generated agglomerated Au-NP were converted into compact spherical Au-NP by thermal annealing at 600 °C.

The characterization included mass-mobility relationships, effective densities (assessed by an Aerosol Particles Mass analyzer), primary particle analysis (based on Transmission Electron Microscopy), as well as total mass and number concentration outputs. The relationships between mass and mobility are well described by power-law functions with exponents of 2. 18 – 2. 35.
