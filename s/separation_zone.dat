5000|$|Thin airfoil theory {{does not}} account for the stall of the airfoil, which usually occurs at an angle of attack between 10° and 15° for typical airfoils. In the mid-late 2000's, however, a theory {{predicting}} the onset of leading edge stall was proposed by Wallace J. Morris II in his doctoral thesis. [...] Morris's subsequent refinements contain the details on the current state of theoretical knowledge on the leading edge stall phenomenon. Morris's theory predicts the critical angle of attack for leading-edge stall onset as the condition at which a global <b>separation</b> <b>zone</b> is predicted in the solution for the inner flow. Morris's theory demonstrates that a subsonic flow about a thin airfoil can be described in terms of an outer region, around most of the airfoil chord, and an inner region, around the nose, that asymptotically match each other. As the flow in the outer region is dominated by classical thin airfoil theory, Morris's equations exhibit many components of thin airfoil theory.|$|E
50|$|Applying strong pressure, in November 1995 the United States {{persuaded the}} presidents of Serbia, Bosnia, and Croatia to attend a conference in Dayton, Ohio, that after much {{contention}} produced a peace agreement, formally signed in Paris in mid-December. It provided for cessation of hostilities, withdrawal of the combatants to specified lines, creation of a <b>separation</b> <b>zone,</b> and the stationing in Bosnia of a Peace Implementation Force (IFOR). The North Atlantic Council, with Perry participating, had decided in September 1995 to develop a NATO-led force to implement any peace agreement for Bosnia, setting the force size at 60,000 troops, including 20,000 from the United States. In congressional testimony in November Perry explained why U.S. troops should go to Bosnia: The war threatened vital U.S. political, economic, and security interests in Europe; {{there was a real}} opportunity to stop the bloodshed; the United States was the only nation that could lead a NATO force to implement the peace; and the risks to the United States of allowing the war to continue were greater than the risks of the planned military operation.|$|E

40|$|The {{hydraulic}} {{effect of}} asymmetric compound bedforms on tidal currents was assessed from field measurements of flow velocity in the Knudedyb tidal inlet, Denmark. Large asymmetric bedforms with smaller superimposed ones {{are a common}} feature of sandy shallow water environments and are known to act as hydraulic roughness elements in dependence with flow direction. The presence of a flow <b>separation</b> <b>zone</b> on the bedform lee was estimated through analysis of the measured velocity directions and the calculation of the flow separation line. The Law of the Wall was used to calculate roughness lengths and shear velocities from log-linear segments sought on transect-averaged and single-location velocity profiles. During the ebb tide a permanent flow <b>separation</b> <b>zone</b> was established over the steep (10 - 20 °) lee sides of the ebb-oriented primary bedforms, which generated a consequent drag on the flow. During the flood, no flow separation was induced by the gentle (2 °) lee side of the primary bedforms except over the steepest (10 °) part of the lee side where a small <b>separation</b> <b>zone</b> was sometimes observed. As a result, hydraulic roughness was only due to the superimposed bedforms. The parameterized flow separation line was found to underestimate {{the length of the}} flow <b>separation</b> <b>zone</b> of the primary bedforms. A better estimation of the presence and shape of the flow <b>separation</b> <b>zone</b> over complex bedforms in a tidal environment still needs to be determined; in particular the relationship between flow <b>separation</b> <b>zone</b> and bedform geometry (asymmetry, relative height or slope of the lee side) is unclear.

40|$|The {{injection}} streak line flow visualization {{method has}} been used to study the instabilities of steady and pulsatile flows downstream of a 66. 6 % symmetric stenosis in a two-dimensional channel with rigid walls. Detailed description of the steady flow development for various Reynolds numbers (Re) is provided and the critical values are extracted. At Re = 34 the flow became asymmetric, while at Re = 118 three-dimensional effects were present. However, two new observations were apparent in our experiments. A smaller instability appeared between the two major disturbances in the flow which was correlated with the presence of a third separation region downstream of the smaller of the two <b>separation</b> <b>zones</b> adjacent to the stenosis throat exit. In addition, the transition to three-dimensional flow initially was accompanied by a sudden change in the <b>separation</b> <b>zones</b> length which passed through an accommodation region to compensate the new conditions that established oscillations and then turbulence. Thus, a transition zone to turbulence is recognized that takes place in a relatively large range of Reynolds numbers. On the other hand, experiments with pulsatile flow have bee...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{the flow}} {{characteristics}} {{have been investigated}} by measuring <b>separation</b> <b>zone,</b> surface and velocity profiles over the circular crested side weirs. An equation was proposed {{for the length of}} the <b>separation</b> <b>zone</b> using dimensional, statistical and regression analysis. The dimensional analysis showed that the length of <b>separation</b> <b>zone</b> depends on the upstream to the downstream water depth over the side weir, channel width to the downstream water depth and the Froude number. Comparison of the longitudinal and sectional surface profiles showed that the surface profiles at the vicinity of the side weir are non-uniform, due to <b>separation</b> <b>zone</b> close to the side weir. Therefore, the suitable place for measuring the characteristics of flow is along the centre line of the channel.

40|$|Flow {{separation}} plays a {{key role}} in the development of dunes, and modeling the complicated flow behavior inside the flow <b>separation</b> <b>zone</b> requires much computational effort. To make a first step toward modeling dune development at reasonable temporal and spatial scales, a parameterization of the shape of the flow <b>separation</b> <b>zone</b> over two-dimensional dunes is proposed herein, in order to avoid modeling the complex flow inside the flow <b>separation</b> <b>zone.</b> Flow separation behind dunes, with an angle-of-repose slip face, is characterized by a large circulating leeside eddy, where a separation streamline forms the upper boundary of the recirculating eddy. Experimental data of turbulent flow over two-dimensional subaqueous bed forms are used to parameterize this separation streamline. The bed forms have various heights and height to length ratios, and a wide range of flow conditions is analyzed. This paper shows that the shape of the flow <b>separation</b> <b>zone</b> can be approximated by a third-order polynomial as a function of the distance away from the flow separation point. The coefficients of the polynomial can be estimated, independent of flow conditions, on the basis of bed form shape at the flow separation point and a constant angle of the separation streamline at the flow reattachment point. ...|$|E
