30|$|There {{are many}} factors leading to steam {{breakthrough}}. In summary, steam breakthrough often occurs because of strong heterogeneity of the reservoir, severe steam overlay in thick oil layers, high pressure difference between injector and producer, in-layer thermal/pressure communication, or irrational injection parameters. Many researchers {{have done a}} lot of intensive studies. Ge (1982) and Kong et al. (2005) believe that the injected steam will form a globoid with high pressure. The pressure of the globoid will increase along with steam injection. Under certain conditions, the steam under high pressure will break through in the weakest part of the layers. And these layers mainly refer to the areas with the highest permeability. After the breakthrough occurs, the banded <b>steam</b> <b>channel</b> will be formed and it will become the main flow area between the injector and the producer. Yoshiaki (1984) proposed sand deformation theory in the process of steam flooding. He believes that microchannels will be created when steam penetrates the unconsolidated oil sand. The structure of the reservoir will change and the level of pressure and the characteristic of flow will show the difference. Some researchers also declare that most heavy oil reservoir belongs to unconsolidated sandstone (Liu 1998; Yi 2002). So it is easy for sand to move because of low consolidation strength. What is worse, the high pressure and high temperature steam has a great scouring capacity, which aggravates the sand moving out. In addition, heavy oil has a high flow capacity under high temperature. So the drag force of the fluid will overcome the consolidation strength of the rock. Then the skeleton sand will be stripped and breakthrough channeling will be enlarged. What is more, thermal-viscous fingering and steam overlay will also lead to steam penetrating into the producer earlier (Islam and Azaiez 2011; Yuan et al. 2010).|$|E
30|$|According to the {{fluidity}} variation {{before and}} after steam breakthrough, a tapering distribution of <b>steam</b> breakthrough <b>channel</b> in heavy oil reservoirs is described. And based on this description, the steam breakthrough volume and blocking volume for single direction complete breakthrough well, single direction incomplete breakthrough well and multidirectional breakthrough wells within one well group are calculated.|$|R
30|$|Steam {{breakthrough}} {{is affected}} by many factors, such as permeability contrast, oil viscosity and steam injection parameters. And many field data show that there exist obvious differences between steam breakthrough wells and non-steam breakthrough wells in oil recovery, water cut and temperature. In this paper, the experiments conducted mainly aim to study the characteristics of steam breakthrough under heterogeneous conditions and provide references for the following parameters selection of steam breakthrough identification. Through dual-sandpack physical models with different permeability, the heterogeneity can be obtained and the <b>steam</b> breakthrough <b>channel</b> will be formed {{in the process of}} steam injection. Then the variations of temperature and oil recovery between <b>steam</b> breakthrough <b>channel</b> and non-steam breakthrough area can be measured and calculated, which are beneficial to understand the large distinction deduced by steam breakthrough. What is more, the effects of oil viscosity and permeability contrast are discussed.|$|R
30|$|For heavy oil, its {{sensitivity}} of temperature {{leads to a}} great fluidity difference under different temperature. In the stage of steam huff and puff, if the interruption of the working system is out of consideration, the sweep area of steam for a producer {{at the end of}} steam stimulation is similar to a circle. In this area, the temperature of layers increases obviously and the fluidity of oil is better. So the oil produced almost comes from this area. During the following steam flooding process, the injected steam will invade along with the main streamline between the injector and the producer. And only the oil which is heated by steam can flow effectively. Once steam breakthrough happens, the flow resistance in the <b>steam</b> breakthrough <b>channel</b> decreases very fast. Steam and condensate liquid previously flowing to a variety of directions will rapidly move close to the main streamline and aggregate into the production well. In this case, steam sweep efficiency decreases and the fluidity of heavy oil outside the <b>steam</b> breakthrough <b>channel</b> drops drastically. And most of the produced liquid consists of steam and condensate water. Depending on this theory, the <b>steam</b> breakthrough <b>channel</b> can be divided into two areas: near-wellbore part and interwell part. And with the further development of steam channeling, a taper distribution area of steam and condensed water channel which is different from the lobate area in the water flooding process is gradually formed, as shown in Fig.  5.|$|R

40|$|The {{influx of}} new digital media {{technologies}} and platforms {{have made it}} possible for consumers of media products to more easily create and distribute their own works, which breaks away from the traditional production of culture of media by established, professional creators. Consequently, there has been a rise in the immaterial labor of digital media creators, as well as a formation of online communities of disparately connected users through commonly held interests. Within the medium of video games, this convergence between user and producer of content, the tension between control and innovation of media content and form, online communities and immaterial labor is most clearly seen in the practice of modding, here defined as using legally authorized software to modify video game content. Modding for computer games has been occurring since the early 1990 s, and has grown considerably due to the expansion of the internet 2 ̆ 7 s capabilities for connecting people and distributing large bands of data. In 2012, Skyrim developers Bethesda Softworks released a free software development tool called the Creation Kit. The Creation Kit allowed computer users to modify the game content, at which point the user could publically release their mods through the authorized <b>Steam</b> Workshop <b>Channel.</b> The Creation Kit was distributed via Steam, an electronic digital games store operated by Valve Corporation, Inc. Because Bethesda required users to play Skyrim through Steam, the <b>Steam</b> Workshop <b>Channel</b> was intended to be the primary distribution and gathering location of the modding community for Skyrim. However, most existing modders already had many previously established third-party modding databases and websites for distribution, which meant that the <b>Steam</b> Workshop <b>Channel</b> was a new and forced entry into the modding community. Using a combination of ethnographic methods (participant observation and interviews) and textual analysis of message board data, and in research gathered between September 2013 and January 2014, this dissertation explores the community dynamics of the modders on the <b>Steam</b> Workshop <b>Channel</b> for Skyrim to help locate the identity politics of the community, as well as navigating the tension between innovation and control within the community. It also explores how a digital media producer attempts to control a space of fan-made production, and what that means for the existing community. I participated and observed conversations on modding community dynamics in specific forums on the Steam Community Workshop for Skyrim. There, I gathered textual data from a diverse sample of conversations located on discussion boards and a diverse set of mods ranging in user-defined ratings (high-rated to low-rated) to highlight the conversational dynamics and implicit and explicit structuring of the community. I gathered materials from over 403 relevant conversation threads on the Steam Community Workshop for Skyrim. I also conducted telephone, web and email interviews with a purposive sample group of 15 modders based on their ranking in the community in order to gather their personal motivations for participating in the group and perceptions of norms, rituals and values in the group. Results indicate that modding communities are hierarchized by historically locating the user within the practice, as well as through extensive technical knowledge and frequency of communication. Heavy users and mod creators separate themselves from 2 ̆ 2 non-modders 2 ̆ 2 or mod users through these practices, defining their identities through discourse and the values of creation. The <b>Steam</b> Workshop <b>Channel</b> was a collision between mod creators and non-modder users, sometimes with clashing ideologies that dissuaded heavier users from fully embracing the Steam Workshop. This study illustrates how Bethesda and Valve were perceived by existing modders, and suggests that companies need to pay attention to how historically located communities of users respond to the actions, policies, membership, and moderation of professional media consumers...|$|R

30|$|Steam {{breakthrough}} {{has a great}} {{negative influence}} {{on the development of}} steam flooding in heavy oil reservoirs. In this article, a new profile control design based on quantitative identification of <b>steam</b> breakthrough <b>channel</b> is introduced. Firstly, dual-sandpack experiments are conducted to study the characteristics and influencing factors of steam breakthrough. Then based on the experimental results as well as pretreatment and combination of geological parameters and production data, comprehensive identification parameter (CIP) is achieved through the analytic hierarchy process to quantitatively describe the degree of steam breakthrough. Afterward, the breakthrough types of production wells are determined by CIP and the volume of breakthrough channels and profile control parameters among the injector and the producers are calculated according to the tapering distribution of steam breakthrough in the process of steam flooding in heavy oil reservoirs. The experiment results show that there exists a large difference between breakthrough channels and non-breakthrough areas in temperature and oil recovery. Permeability contrast is an important factor, which influences the direction of steam breakthrough, and temperature has a great correlation with oil recovery under the heterogeneous condition. The determination of CIP is an attempt to quantify the degree of breakthrough and it combines many factors, which show the difference between the injector and the producer, as well as the difference between producers. All producers of the steam flooding well group can be divided into complete breakthrough wells with CIP over 0.5 and incomplete breakthrough wells with CIP below 0.5 for calculating conveniently. Based on the tapering distribution of the <b>steam</b> breakthrough <b>channel,</b> blocking parameters considering oil drainage radius around the injector, temperature distribution between the injector and the producer and the demand of blocking effect and field reality are obtained to calculate the blocking volume for complete breakthrough wells and incomplete breakthrough wells. This method {{could be used as a}} tool to judge breakthrough degree and design profile control parameters for oilfields with heavy oil reservoirs.|$|R
