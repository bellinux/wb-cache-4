25|$|Solid {{activated}} carbon, also termed consolidated {{amorphous carbon}} (CAC) {{is the most}} used electrode material for supercapacitors and may be cheaper than other carbon derivatives. It is produced from activated carbon powder pressed into the desired <b>shape,</b> <b>forming</b> a block with a wide distribution of pore sizes. An electrode with a surface area of about 1000m2/g results in a typical double-layer capacitance of about 10μF/cm2 and a specific capacitance of 100F/g.|$|E
25|$|PEX is a medium- to {{high-density}} polyethylene containing cross-link bonds {{introduced into the}} polymer structure, changing the thermoplastic into a thermoset. The high-temperature properties of the polymer are improved, its flow is reduced, and its chemical resistance is enhanced. PEX is used in some potable-water plumbing systems because tubes made of the material can be expanded to fit over a metal nipple and it will slowly return to its original <b>shape,</b> <b>forming</b> a permanent, water-tight connection.|$|E

The aircraft carried up to [...] of bombs, with the pilot aiming two fixed forward firing machine guns, and the observer operating two flexibly mounted machine guns, one in a dorsal position and one in a ventral mount.|$|E
2500|$|South of the Fraser River at Wahleach Lake is the Mount Barr Plutonic Complex. Named after Mount Barr in the Skagit Range of the Cascade Mountains, this {{plutonic}} complex ranges in {{age from}} 21to 16million years old. It consists of at least four plutons. The main pluton, comprising 80% of the complex, comprises felsic and intermediate intrusive rocks ranging from quartz diorite to quartz monzonite. It is roughly circular in <b>shape,</b> <b>forming</b> [...] high Mount Barr. Subsequent magmatism created two younger stocks in the main pluton. The older stock consists of fine-grained biotite hornblende granodiorite while the younger stock comprises leucocratic biotite quartz monzonite. A [...] wide dike, composed of granophyric hornblende plagioclase porphyry, is situated between quartz diorite of the Hope Plutonic Complex and Eocene conglomerate. It represents {{an offshoot of the}} main Mount Barr pluton. Just northwest of the main Mount Barr pluton is a biotite hornblende quartz diorite pluton near Hicks Lake. Because of its heterogeneity, it is only occasionally grouped as part of the Mount Barr Plutonic Complex.|$|E
