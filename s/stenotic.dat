5|$|Some pugs {{are also}} born with <b>stenotic</b> nares {{which can also}} inhibit their breathing. In serious cases, the pinched {{nostrils}} make breathing even more difficult for this breed and put added pressure on the larynx. In some cases, the dog could pass out from blocked airways. If this happens, one should inquire with their veterinarian whether or not surgery is needed to modify the breathing passages.|$|E
5|$|While TBI may {{be managed}} without surgery, {{surgical}} repair of the tear is considered {{standard in the}} treatment of most TBI. It is required if a tear interferes with ventilation; if mediastinitis (inflammation of the tissues in the mid-chest) occurs; or if subcutaneous or mediastinal emphysema progresses rapidly; or if air leak or large pneumothorax is persistent despite chest tube placement. Other indications for surgery are a tear more than one third the circumference of the airway, tears with loss of tissue, and a need for positive pressure ventilation. Damaged tissue around a rupture (e.g. torn or scarred tissue) may be removed in order to obtain clean edges that can be surgically repaired. Debridement of damaged tissue can shorten the trachea by as much as 50%. Repair of extensive tears can include sewing a flap of tissue taken from the membranes surrounding the heart or lungs (the pericardium and pleura, respectively) over the sutures to protect them. When lung tissue is destroyed as a result of TBI complications, pneumonectomy or lobectomy (removal of a lung or of one lobe, respectively) may be required. Pneumonectomy is avoided whenever possible due to the high rate of death associated with the procedure. Surgery to repair a tear in the tracheobronchial tree can be successful even when it is performed months after the trauma, as can occur if the diagnosis of TBI is delayed. When airway stenosis results after delayed diagnosis, surgery is similar to that performed after early diagnosis: the <b>stenotic</b> section is removed and the cut airway is repaired.|$|E

25|$|Brachycephalic {{syndrome}} {{is a condition}} seen in brachycephalic (short-nosed) dogs, characterized {{by the presence of}} <b>stenotic</b> nares, elongated soft palate, narrow trachea, collapsed larynx, and everted laryngeal saccules. Signs include difficult and noisy breathing. Surgical options are available.|$|E
25|$|If atheroma, or clots, are {{protruding}} {{into the}} lumen, producing narrowing, the narrowing {{may be seen}} instead as increased haziness within the X-ray shadow images of the blood/dye column within {{that portion of the}} artery; this is as compared to adjacent, presumed healthier, less <b>stenotic</b> areas. See the single frame illustration of a coronary angiogram image on the angioplasty page.|$|E
25|$|Repeated plaque ruptures, ones not {{resulting}} in total lumen closure, {{combined with the}} clot patch over the rupture and healing response to stabilize the clot is the process that produces most stenoses over time. The <b>stenotic</b> areas tend to become more stable despite increased flow velocities at these narrowings. Most major blood-flow-stopping events occur at large plaques, which, prior to their rupture, produced very little if any stenosis.|$|E
25|$|Although {{shown to}} be {{relatively}} safe therapies, no angiogenic therapeutic has yet {{made it through the}} gauntlet of clinical testing required for drug approval. By capitalizing on the large database of what did and did not work in previous clinical trials, results from more recent studies with redesigned clinical protocols give renewed hope that angiogenesis therapy will be a treatment choice for sufferers of cardiovascular disease resulting from occluded and/or <b>stenotic</b> vessels.|$|E
25|$|Typical normal {{coronary}} artery pressures are in the <200 mmHg range (27 kPa). The hydraulic pressures applied within the balloon may extend to as high as 19000 mmHg (2,500 kPa). Prevention of over-enlargement is achieved by choosing balloons manufactured out of high tensile strength clear plastic membranes. The balloon is initially folded around the catheter, near the tip, to create a small cross-sectional profile to facilitate passage though luminal <b>stenotic</b> areas, and is designed to inflate to a specific pre-designed diameter. If over inflated, the balloon material simply tears and allows the inflating radiocontrast agent to simply escape into the blood.|$|E
25|$|Zamboni {{and colleagues}} claimed that in MS {{patients}} diagnosed with CCSVI, the azygos and IJV veins are <b>stenotic</b> (abnormally narrowed) in around 90% of cases. Zamboni theorized that malformed blood vessels cause increased deposition of iron in the brain, {{which in turn}} triggers autoimmunity and degeneration of the nerve's myelin sheath. While the initial article on CCSVI claimed that abnormal venous function parameters were not seen in healthy people, others have noted {{that this is not}} the case. In the report by Zamboni none of the healthy participants met criteria for a diagnosis of CCSVI while all patients did. Such outstanding results have raised suspicions of a possible spectrum bias, which originates on a diagnostic test not being used under clinically significant conditions.|$|E
500|$|Various {{diagnostic}} modalities {{exist to}} demonstrate blood flow or absence thereof in the vertebral arteries. The gold standard is cerebral angiography (with or without digital subtraction angiography). This involves puncture {{of a large}} artery (usually the femoral artery) and advancing an intravascular catheter through the aorta towards the vertebral arteries. At that point, radiocontrast is injected and its downstream flow captured on fluoroscopy (continuous X-ray imaging). The vessel may appear <b>stenotic</b> (narrowed, 41–75%), occluded (blocked, 18–49%), or as an aneurysm (area of dilation, 5–13%). The narrowing may be described as [...] "rat's tail" [...] or [...] "string sign". Cerebral angiography is an invasive procedure, and it requires large volumes of radiocontrast that can cause complications such as kidney damage. Angiography also does not directly demonstrate the blood in the vessel wall, as opposed to more modern modalities. The only remaining use of angiography is when endovascular treatment is contemplated (see below).|$|E
2500|$|René Favaloro, an Argentine surgeon, {{achieved}} a physiologic {{approach in the}} surgical management of coronary artery disease—the bypass grafting procedure—at the Cleveland Clinic in May 1967. His new technique used a saphenous vein autograft to replace a <b>stenotic</b> segment of the right coronary artery. Later, he successfully used the saphenous vein as a bypassing channel, which has become the typical bypass graft technique we know today; in the U.S., this vessel is typically harvested endoscopically, using a technique known as endoscopic vessel harvesting (EVH).|$|E
2500|$|When the {{mitral valve}} area goes less than 1cm2, {{there will be}} an {{increase}} in the left atrial pressures (required to push blood through the <b>stenotic</b> valve). Since the normal left ventricular diastolic pressures is about 5 mmHg, a pressure gradient across the mitral valve of 20 mmHg due to severe mitral stenosis will cause a left atrial pressure of about 25 mmHg. This left atrial pressure is transmitted to the pulmonary vasculature and causes pulmonary hypertension. [...] Pulmonary capillary pressures in this level cause an imbalance between the hydrostatic pressure and the oncotic pressure, leading to extravasation of fluid from the vascular tree and pooling of fluid in the lungs (congestive heart failure causing pulmonary edema).|$|E
50|$|A {{coronary}} angioplasty is a therapeutic procedure {{to treat the}} <b>stenotic</b> (narrowed) coronary arteries of the heart found in coronary heart disease. These <b>stenotic</b> segments are due to the buildup of cholesterol-laden plaques that form due to atherosclerosis. A percutaneous coronary intervention is first performed.|$|E

5000|$|The Reynolds number {{helps us}} to predict the {{transition}} between laminar and turbulent flows. Laminar flow is highly organized flow along streamlines. As velocity increases, flow can become disorganized and chaotic [...] This is known as turbulent flow. Laminar flow occurs in flow environments where Re < 2000. Turbulent flow is present in circumstances under which Re > 4000. The range of 2000 < Re < 4000 {{is known as the}} transition range.Most blood flow in humans is laminar, having a Re of 300 or less, it is possible for turbulence to occur at very high flow rates in the descending aorta, for example, in highly conditioned athletes. Turbulence is also common in pathological conditions such as heart murmurs and <b>stenotic</b> heart valves. <b>Stenotic</b> comes from the Greek word [...] "stenos," [...] meaning narrow. <b>Stenotic</b> means narrowed, and a <b>stenotic</b> heart valve is one in which the narrowing of the valve {{is a result of the}} plaque formation on the valve.|$|E

50|$|An {{endovascular}} stent is sometimes {{placed in a}} <b>stenotic</b> vessel immediately following a balloon angioplasty to maintain the widened passage.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{the linear}} {{extension}} of fibrosis, neither a <b>stenotic</b> area resection nor end-end anastomosis were feasible while {{the implementation of}} synthetic material or metallic stent was also not possible. So, the surgical team devised a new technique, employing a cartilage graft to enhance the tracheal luminal diameter. A 10 cm length of the floating 12th rib was extracted, implemented at the anterior aspect of the trachea with interrupted nylon suturing to reconstruct the <b>stenotic</b> area.|$|E

5000|$|Valvular {{disease is}} caused {{primarily}} by valvular lesions stemming from infections, especially rheumatic fever (Streptococceus pyogenes), which {{can result in}} either a regurgitant or <b>stenotic</b> valve, or both. Regurgitation results from lesions on the valve edges or annular dilation which causes backwards-flow of the blood. Stenosis results in thickened leaflets due to heavy fibrosis of the valve so blood cannot flow through normally [...] <b>Stenotic</b> valves require valve replacement however conventional valves have decreased lifespan due to an inflammatory response. Genetic predisposition for valvular disease is uncommon.|$|E
50|$|MI {{caused by}} {{thrombotic}} occlusion in an aneurysmal, <b>stenotic,</b> or both aneurysmal and <b>stenotic</b> coronary artery {{is the main}} cause of death from Kawasaki disease. The highest risk of MI occurs in the first year after the onset of the disease. MI in children presents with different symptoms from those in adults. The main symptoms were shock, unrest, vomiting, and abdominal pain; chest pain was most common in older children. Most of these children had the attack occurring during sleep or at rest, and around one-third of attacks were asymptomatic.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Stenotic</b> nares {{is part of}} the brachycephalic {{syndrome}} of short-nosed dogs. Breeds such as Boxers, Bulldogs, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, Pugs, Boston Terriers, Shih Tzus, Lhasa Apsos, etc. are all considered brachycephalic breeds. <b>Stenotic</b> nares {{means the}} nostrils are pinched or narrow. This makes it more difficult to breathe and causes snorting and snoring in these animals. It is a congenital trait; these animals are born with it. Veterinarians perform a simple surgery to help widen the nares, often {{at the same time as}} a spay or neuter.|$|E
5000|$|Angioplasty also {{requires}} a balloon catheter, {{which is used}} to stretch open a <b>stenotic</b> vessel; this relieves restricted blood flow, which could otherwise lead to congestive heart failure ( [...] CHF [...] ).|$|E
