2500|$|Although {{the types}} of telescopes that amateurs build vary widely, {{including}} Refractors, Schmidt–Cassegrains and Maksutovs, the most popular telescope design is the Newtonian reflector, described by Russell W. Porter as “The Poor Man's Telescope”. The Newtonian {{has the advantage of}} being a simple design that allows for maximum size for the minimum expense. And since the design employs a single front surface mirror as its objective it only has one surface that has to be ground and polished, as opposed to three for the Maksutov and four for the refractor and the Schmidt–Cassegrain. Typically a Newtonian telescope of 6” or 8" [...] (15 or 20cm) aperture is a standard <b>starter</b> <b>project,</b> constructed as a club project or by individuals working from books or from plans found on the Internet.|$|E

40|$|The <b>StartER</b> <b>project</b> (Strategic neTwork for Assistive and Rehabilitation Technology in Emilia-Romagna) {{was born}} {{in the context of the}} “Technology {{innovation}} and transfer from research institutes to industries” program financed by Regione Emilia Romagna (Italy) for the biennium 2005 - 2006. StartER is the only non-genetics related project approved concerning the development and application of advanced technologies for healthcare improvement. Several institutes participate in StartER, such as universities, rehabilitation centres, prostheses centres and private companies. Their fields of interest are engineering and biomedical engineering, medical and social rehabilitation, education, aids for disability and domotics. All the involved partners have a long experience in their own specific field, and they compose a picture of brilliant individualities, but fragmented for what concerns the ability of effective innovation for disability. What really lacks to each single partner considered on its own is a complete vision over the entire product know-how and process, from the identification of patients/clinicians needs, to the design, test and marketing of new devices/clinical protocols. In other words, each partner lacks the possibility to be on the market as a single interlocutor able to offer integrated solutions for the monitoring, the characterization and the reduction of disability. The aim of StartER is to overcome this condition, creating a network able to answer to the disableds need of adequate and innovative solutions, both in terms of rehabilitation and assistive technologies, and to transfer this know-how to the companies, so that not only new solutions will be studied and tested, but also they will be available on the market...|$|E
