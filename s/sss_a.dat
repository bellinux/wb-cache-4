40|$|The first {{detected}} {{gravitational wave}} from {{a neutron star}} merger was GW 170817. In this study, we present J-GEM follow-up observations of <b>SSS</b> 17 <b>a,</b> an electromagnetic counterpart of GW 170817. <b>SSS</b> 17 <b>a</b> shows a 2. 5 -mag decline in the z-band from 1. 7 days to 7. 7 days after the merger. Such a rapid decline is not comparable with supernovae light curves at any epoch. The color of <b>SSS</b> 17 <b>a</b> also evolves rapidly and becomes redder for later epochs; the z-H color changed by approximately 2. 5 mag {{in the period of}} 0. 7 days to 7. 7 days. The rapid evolution of both the optical brightness and the color are consistent with the expected properties of a kilonova that is powered by the radioactive decay of newly synthesized r-process nuclei. Kilonova models with Lanthanide elements can reproduce the aforementioned observed properties well, which suggests that r-process nucleosynthesis beyond the second peak takes place in <b>SSS</b> 17 <b>a.</b> However, the absolute magnitude of <b>SSS</b> 17 <b>a</b> is brighter than the expected brightness of the kilonova models with the ejecta mass of 0. 01, which suggests a more intense mass ejection (∼ 0. 03) or possibly an additional energy source.

We report time-series spectroscopy of <b>SSS</b> 17 <b>a</b> from 11. 75 hours until 8. 5 days after merger. Over {{the first hour}} of observations the ejecta rapidly expanded and cooled. Applying blackbody fits to the spectra, we measure the photosphere cooling from $ 11, 000 ^{+ 3400 }_{- 900 }$ K to $ 9300 ^{+ 300 }_{- 300 }$ K, and determine a photospheric velocity of roughly 30 % {{of the speed of}} light. The spectra of <b>SSS</b> 17 <b>a</b> begin displaying broad features after 1. 46 days, and evolve qualitatively over each subsequent day, with distinct blue (early-time) and red (late-time) components.

30|$|Based on the {{literature}} and this data {{we have been able}} to find, we have formulated four hypotheses about SSS: 1) a longer coastline leads to more SSS, 2) a higher GDP leads to more SSS, 3) more ports lead to more SSS, and 4) a large rail infrastructure leads to less <b>SSS.</b> <b>A</b> longer coastline would also most likely mean more ports and thus more possibilities for the usage of SSS. Also islands tend to have a longer coastline and by nature are more involved in SSS. In general, a higher GDP means more freight flows and more freight flows might also indicate more possibilities for SSS. If more ports are available and offering SSS services this might also result in more SSS for a country. Finally, the interaction between freight transport networks, such as SSS and rail could be interesting to analyze. SSS and rail might compete on certain routes and if rail options are available this might harm SSS.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Metric {{spaces are}} a very active {{research}} field which offers efficient methods for indexing and searching by similarity in large data sets. In this paper we present a new clustering-based method for similarity search called SSSTree. Its main characteristic is that the centers of each cluster are selected using Sparse Spatial Selection (<b>SSS),</b> <b>a</b> technique initially developed for the selection of pivots. SSS is able to adapt the set of selected points (pivots or cluster centers) to the intrinsic dimensionality of the space. Using SSS, the number of clusters in each node of the tree depends on {{the complexity of the}} subspace it represents. The space partition in each node will be made depending on that complexity, improving thus the performance of the search operation. In this paper we present this new method and provide experimental results showing that SSSTree performs better than previously proposed indexes.
