25|$|Critics of Israel as a Jewish {{nation state}} have {{suggested}} that it should adopt more inclusive and neutral symbolism for the national flag and anthem arguing that they exclude the non-Jewish citizens of Israel from their narrative of a national identity. Defenders of the flag <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> flags in Europe bear crosses (such as the flags of Sweden, Finland, Norway, United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Greece), while flags in predominantly Muslim countries bear distinctive Muslim symbols (such as Turkey, Tunisia, Algeria, Mauritania, and Saudi Arabia).|$|E
25|$|In general, {{allegedly}} overly unrealistic {{assumptions are}} one of the most common criticisms towards neoclassical economics. It is fair to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> (but not all) of these criticisms can only be directed towards a subset of the neoclassical models (for example, there are many neoclassical models where unregulated markets fail to achieve Pareto-optimality and there has recently been an increased interest in modeling non-rational decision making). Its disregard for social reality and its alleged role in aiding the elites to widen the wealth gap and social inequality is also frequently criticized.|$|E
500|$|According to {{frontman}} Dave Mustaine, {{the album}} title refers to stereotypical rock stars. When {{asked about the}} matter, and an earlier comment about Axl Rose having killed the traditional rock star image, Mustaine explained that [...] "People want heroes. Most bands look like average Joes, wearing gas-station shirts, have funky hair-dos and I think people wanna {{be able to go}} 'they may not be popular, but they're MY band.'" [...] Mustaine went on to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> of contemporary rock music groups looked and sounded the same, and that the music industry needed a hero. He then proceeded to contrast a perceived lack of image of then current music scenes with the image of 1980s metal bands like Iron Maiden and Judas Priest.|$|E

500|$|Welfare {{groups have}} {{expressed}} {{concerns about the}} treatment of this segment of the Hong Kong workforce, and the 2014 Erwiana Sulistyaningsih abuse case (which attracted international news headlines) focused on the plight of foreign workers in the territory. Thousands took to the streets, demanding justice for Sulistyaningsih. Although the government calls her case an isolated one, welfare groups <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> workers are victims of [...] "modern-day slavery" [...] and abuse by employers. Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor reported that a substantial percentage of workers are mistreated by their employers; of 2,500 workers interviewed, at least 25 percent said they had experienced violations of their contract (including pay less than the MAW and being denied their mandatory weekly day of rest and statutory holidays). More than 25 percent had also experienced physical and verbal abuse, including a [...] "significant incidence" [...] of sexual abuse. According to Caritas Hong Kong, their Asian Migrant Worker Social Service Project helpline received over four thousand calls from workers and 53 workers received assistance to remain in Hong Kong and pursue their claims. According to Belthune House executive director Adwina Antonio, the shelter dealt with 7,000 cases of alleged abuse in the first three-quarters of 2013 (compared with 3,000 for all of 2012).|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, Byrne {{provided}} {{financial backing}} {{to form the}} advocacy group Class Education, whose goal is to change state laws to require schools {{to spend at least}} 65 percent of their operating budgets on classroom expenses. Proponents of the standard contend that it would free up money to increase teachers' salaries without requiring tax increases. Critics <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> services deemed [...] "non-classroom" [...] are necessary for education, including librarians, school nurses, guidance counselors, food service workers and school bus drivers.|$|E

[...] The reporter goes on to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> architects would not [...] "quibble" [...] with other components of MVA such as [...] "balance and symmetry", a vastu fence or wall and [...] "solar influenced" [...] placement of rooms in the home.|$|E

2500|$|This profile {{differs from}} that found among recent local (as opposed to global) Islamist suicide bombers in Afghanistan, {{according}} to a 2007 study of 110 suicide bombers by Afghan pathologist Dr. Yusef Yadgari. Yadgari found that 80% of the attackers studied {{had some kind of}} physical or mental disability. The bombers were also [...] "not celebrated like their counterparts in other Muslim nations. Afghan bombers are not featured on posters or in videos as martyrs." [...] Daniel Byman, a Middle East expert at the Brookings Institution, and Christine Fair, an assistant professor in peace and security studies at Georgetown University, <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> of the Islamic terrorists are foolish and untrained, perhaps even untrainable.|$|E
2500|$|For a {{different}} perspective, see Wolfson. He provides numerous {{examples from the}} 17th to the 20th centuries, which would challenge the view of Halperin cited above {{as well as the}} notion that [...] "modern Judaism" [...] has rejected or dismissed this [...] "outdated aspect" [...] of the religion and, he argues, there are still Kabbalists today who harbor this view. He argues that, while it is accurate to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> Jews do and would find this distinction offensive, it is inaccurate to say that the idea has been totally rejected in all circles. As Wolfson has argued, it is an ethical demand on the part of scholars to continue to be vigilant with regard to this matter and in this way the tradition can be refined from within.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2008, Vitter – {{along with}} Senators Larry Craig and Mike Crapo of Idaho – blocked the {{confirmation}} of Michael J. Sullivan {{as head of the}} Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) saying Sullivan supports [...] "burdensome regulations" [...] on gun owners and dealers and is [...] "overly aggressive" [...] enforcing gun laws. An editorial writer for The Boston Globe wrote that Vitter's position was [...] "unreasonable" [...] because the guns Sullivan sought to control are those commonly used in crimes: those stolen or purchased on the black market. On the other hand, gun rights advocates <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> gun dealers have lost their licenses for harmless bureaucratic errors. Sullivan stayed on as acting head of the ATF until January 2009 to make way for President Barack Obama to name his own nominee.|$|E

2500|$|In August 1831, Smith {{announced}} that he had received a revelation admonishing Rigdon for exalting himself: [...] "And now behold, verily I say unto you, I, the Lord, am not pleased with my servant Sidney Rigdon; he exalted himself in his heart, and received not counsel, but grieved the Spirit; Wherefore his writing is not acceptable unto the Lord, and he shall make another; and if the Lord receive it not, behold he standeth no longer in the office to which I have appointed him. ... Wherefore, let all men beware how they take my name in their lips—For behold, verily I <b>say,</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> there be who are under this condemnation, who use the name of the Lord, and use it in vain, having not authority. Wherefore, let the church repent of their sins, and I, the Lord, will own them otherwise they shall be cut off." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bakhtin briefly {{outlined}} the polyphonic concept of truth. He criticized the assumption that, if two people disagree, {{at least one}} of them must be in error. He challenged philosophers for whom plurality of minds is accidental and superfluous. For Bakhtin, truth is not a statement, a sentence or a phrase. Instead, understanding is a number of mutually addressed, albeit contradictory and logically inconsistent, statements. Understanding needs a multitude of carrying voices. It cannot be held within a single mind, or be expressed by [...] "a single mouth". The polyphonic truth requires many simultaneous voices. Bakhtin does not mean to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> voices carry partial truths that complement each other. A number of different voices do not make the truth if simply [...] "averaged" [...] or [...] "synthesized". Rather, it is the fact of mutual addressivity, of engagement, and of commitment to the context of a real-life event, that distinguishes understanding from misunderstanding.|$|E
2500|$|Even in 2007, at {{the tenth}} {{anniversary of the}} massacre, members of Las Abejas {{reported}} {{that some of the}} killers have not been brought to justice. [...] Diego Perez Jimenez, then president of Las Abejas, expressed his frustration with those who claim that justice has already been served, or that some who have been prosecuted ought not to be imprisoned: [...] "They tell so many lies," [...] he says. [...] "These guys in jails were killers, and there are more killers out there. [...] That's the truth," [...] he insists. [...] Many of those imprisoned, however, insist that they are not guilty, such as Agostin Gomez Perez, who has been imprisoned for more than a decade. [...] "What happened in Acteal is very sad," [...] he says, [...] "But I wasn't involved in it. [...] I didn't kill a soul." [...] Some human rights groups <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> of the arrested have been innocent scapegoats, and that successive governments have protected the real perpetrators and the masterminds behind the massacre.|$|E

2500|$|In 1989, a {{widespread}} popular and armed insurgency started in Kashmir. After the 1987 state legislative assembly election, {{some of the}} results were disputed. This resulted {{in the formation of}} militant wings and {{marked the beginning of the}} Mujahadeen insurgency, which continues to this day. India contends that the insurgency was largely started by Afghan mujahadeen who entered the Kashmir valley following the end of the Soviet-Afghan War. Yasin Malik, a leader of one faction of the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front, was one of the Kashmiris to organise militancy in Kashmir, along with Ashfaq Majeed Wani, Javaid Ahmad Mir, and Abdul Hamid Sheikh. Since 1995, Malik has renounced the use of violence and calls for strictly peaceful methods to resolve the dispute. Malik developed differences with one of the senior leaders, Farooq Siddiqui (alias Farooq Papa), for shunning demands for an independent Kashmir and trying to cut a deal with the Indian Prime Minister. This resulted in a split in which Bitta Karate, Salim Nanhaji, and other senior comrades joined Farooq Papa. Pakistan claims these insurgents are Jammu and Kashmir citizens, and are rising up against the Indian army as part of an independence movement. Amnesty International has accused security forces in Indian-controlled Kashmir of exploiting an Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act that enables them to [...] "hold prisoners without trial". The group argues that the law, which allows security forces to detain individuals for up to two years without presenting charges violates prisoners' human rights. In 2011, the state humans right commission said it had evidence that 2,156 bodies had been buried in 40 graves over the last 20 years. The authorities deny such accusations. The security forces say the unidentified dead are militants who may have originally come from outside India. They also <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> of the missing people have crossed into Pakistan-administered Kashmir to engage in militancy. However, according to the state human rights commission, among the identified bodies 574 were those of [...] "disappeared locals", and according to Amnesty International's annual human rights report (2012) it was sufficient for [...] "belying the security forces' claim that they were militants".|$|E
