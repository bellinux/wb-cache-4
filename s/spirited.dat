5|$|Both Walt Disney Pictures and DreamWorks {{bid for the}} US {{distribution}} rights. Eventually, Disney won {{the rights}} to dub the English adaptation of <b>Spirited</b> Away, {{under the supervision of}} Pixar animator John Lasseter. A Miyazaki fan, Lasseter would sit with his staff and watch Miyazaki's work when encountering story problems, and at one point they did so with <b>Spirited</b> Away, which impressed Lasseter. Upon hearing his reaction to the film, people at Disney asked Lasseter if he would be interested in trying to bring <b>Spirited</b> Away to an American audience. Lasseter agreed to be executive producer for English adaptation. Soon, several others began to join the project: Beauty and the Beast co-director Kirk Wise and Aladdin co-producer Donald W. Ernst joined Lasseter as director and producer of <b>Spirited</b> Away respectively. Cindy Davis Hewitt and Donald H. Hewitt penned the English-language dialogue, which they wrote to match the characters' original Japanese-language lip movements.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{penetrations}} inland, the key beach objectives had {{not been}} achieved. The draws necessary for the movement of vehicles off the beach {{had not been}} opened, and the strongpoints defending these were still putting up a <b>spirited</b> resistance. The failure to clear beach obstacles forced subsequent landings to concentrate on Easy Green and Easy Red.|$|E
5|$|Miyazaki {{had wanted}} to produce a new film for years, but his two {{previous}} proposals (one based on the Japanese book Kirino Mukouno Fushigina Machi, and another about a teenage heroine) were rejected. Miyazaki's third proposal, which ended up becoming Sen and Chihiro <b>Spirited</b> Away, was more successful. The three stories revolved around a bathhouse that was inspired by one in Miyazaki's hometown. Miyazaki thought the bathhouse was a mysterious place, {{and there was a}} small door next to one of the bathtubs in the bathhouse. Miyazaki was always curious to what was behind it, and he made up several stories about it, one of which inspired the bathhouse setting of <b>Spirited</b> Away.|$|E
5|$|Miyazaki won the Ōfuji Noburō Award at the Mainichi Film Awards for The Castle of Cagliostro (1979), Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (1984), Laputa: Castle in the Sky (1986), and My Neighbor Totoro (1988), and the Mainichi Film Award for Best Animation Film for Kiki's Delivery Service (1989), Porco Rosso (1992), Princess Mononoke (1997), <b>Spirited</b> Away and Whale Hunt (both 2001). <b>Spirited</b> Away {{was also}} awarded the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, while Howl's Moving Castle (2004) and The Wind Rises (2013) {{received}} nominations.

Natalie Portman was {{originally intended to}} voice Nausicaä, but Alison Lohman was eventually assigned the role.|$|E
5|$|Some {{groups in}} Japan, {{particularly}} those active in Tokyo, also {{emphasize the importance}} of the lively and <b>spirited</b> iki aesthetic.

5|$|The game, played under rugby rules, was {{a battle}} from {{beginning}} to enda regular knock down and drag out fight. Both sides became immediately excited and the audience was aroused to the highest pitch of enthusiasm by the <b>spirited</b> contest. The ball oscillated backward and forward over the ground without any material result.|$|E
5|$|Adkins grew up {{in poverty}} {{in the midst of}} the Depression, and his <b>spirited,</b> unusual {{lifestyle}} is reflected in his music. His songs, which he began recording and distributing locally in the mid-1950s, explored an affinity for sexual intercourse, and decapitation, and were obscure outside of West Virginia until the 1980s. The newfound popularity secured him a cult following, spawned the Norton Records label, and helped usher in the genre known as psychobilly.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} of Rapunzel has been generally positive, with critics complimenting her <b>spirited,</b> lively personality and independence. The tenth Disney Princess, Rapunzel was officially {{inducted into the}} line-up on October 2, 2011, becoming the franchise's first computer-animated member. Her physical appearance and personality have drawn much comparison between her and preceding Disney Princess Ariel from The Little Mermaid (1989), by whom she was inspired.|$|E
5|$|Giant Schnauzers {{have been}} {{described}} as trustworthy with children. They are very intelligent, and can become bored easily. They are also very energetic and highly <b>spirited,</b> which, when coupled with boredom, can lead to unwanted and destructive behavior. They are easily trained, and deeply loyal to their owner. Some breeders believe that pepper and salt colored Giant Schnauzers are more docile than their black-furred counterparts.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, {{the film}} also {{influenced}} many horror films throughout the 1950s and 1960s. In these ghost story films, greed commonly leads to murder and extramarital affairs, many involving former samurai characters. Examples in this genre include Tokaido Yotsuya kaidan (1959). The 1998 Japanese horror film Ringu also {{falls in the}} tradition of Japanese folklore and film, which includes Ugetsu, Tokaido Yotsuya kaidan, Kwaidan (1965) and Onibaba (1964). The 2001 anime fantasy film <b>Spirited</b> Away follows Ugetsu and Kwaidan as a cinematic adaptation of Japanese ghost mythology.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} section in <b>spirited</b> 3/8 time, the {{predominant}} mood is of joyous exaltation reflecting the text from Isaiah. The structure of the choral material in this final section complements that of the first section; there a fugal passage was enclosed between two homophonic episodes; here a homophonic episode is preceded and followed by fugal passages. While the first section is preceded by the lengthy orchestral sinfonia, the final section ends with a short coda for full chorus and orchestra.|$|E

5|$|Martin was an {{integral}} member of the Cardinals' teams of the 1930s that {{became known as the}} Gashouse Gang for their roguish behavior and practical jokes. Early in his career, he was labeled by some contemporary press reports as the next Ty Cobb because of his <b>spirited,</b> hustling style of play. However, because his headlong attitude on the playing field took a physical toll on his body, he never lived up to those initial expectations. After the end of his playing career, he continued his career in baseball as a successful minor league baseball manager.|$|E

5|$|The {{battle was}} brought to greater public {{attention}} in 1992 by a CBC television docu-drama, The Valour and the Horror, which {{made a number of}} controversial claims about senior leadership in the Second World War and devoted one of its three episodes to the Black Watch attack on Verrières Ridge. The episode raised a <b>spirited</b> debate among the historical and veterans' communities and led to calls for apologies from the producers and an official investigation by the CBC Ombudsman into the veracity of the claims {{and the way in which}} they were presented.|$|E
5|$|The {{film has}} been {{compared}} to Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland as the stories have some elements in common such being set in a fantasy world, the plots including a disturbance in logic and stability, and there being motifs such as food having transformational qualities; though developments and themes are not shared. Among other stories compared to <b>Spirited</b> Away, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is seen to be more closely linked thematically.|$|E

5|$|Within {{a matter}} of weeks, the brigade, {{as part of the}} 2nd New Zealand Division, was in Greece and manning defences on the Aliakmon Line in {{preparation}} for the anticipated invasion of the country by the Germans. Following the invasion, Hargest's brigade mounted a <b>spirited</b> defence of its positions at Olympus Pass from 14 to 16 April before it had to withdraw to provide cover neighbouring New Zealand brigades conducting their own retreat. The brigade was eventually evacuated on the night of 24 April to Crete.|$|E
5|$|British General Sir Henry Clinton {{moved up}} from New York City and {{attempted}} to divert American attention by capturing two forts in the Hudson River highlands on October 6, but his efforts were too late to help Burgoyne. Burgoyne attacked Bemis Heights again on October 7 after {{it became apparent that}} he would not receive relieving aid in time. This battle culminated in heavy fighting marked by Arnold's <b>spirited</b> rallying of the American troops. Burgoyne's forces were thrown back to the positions that they held before the September 19 battle and the Americans captured a portion of the entrenched British defenses.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>spirited</b> {{resistance}} from the largest British merchant ship, Windham, {{the failure of the}} other Indiamen to support their leader and the size and power of the French ships forced the British to withdraw: all the HEIC ships were subsequently captured by the larger, faster French warships. A month later, Hamelin's raiding campaign skirted disaster when a winter hurricane on the voyage back to Île de France almost wrecked his flagship Vénus. Vénus only survived with the co-operation of the British prisoners aboard, who brought the ship safely to port. Only two of the captured Indiamen were successfully brought to Ile de France: the same storm that nearly destroyed Vénus scattered the squadron and its prizes, allowing a patrolling British frigate to recapture Windham {{just a few miles from}} the French island.|$|E
5|$|If the {{election}} {{had been left}} to the papacy, Ernst {{would have been the}} choice, but the Pope was {{not a member of the}} Cathedral Chapter and Gebhard had the support of several of the Catholic, and all the Protestant, canons in the Chapter. In December 1577, he was chosen Elector and Archbishop of Cologne after a <b>spirited</b> contest with the papacy's candidate, Ernst: Gebhard won {{the election}} by two votes. Although it was not required of him, Gebhard agreed to undergo priestly ordination; he was duly consecrated in March 1578, and swore to uphold the Council of Trent's decrees.|$|E
5|$|Playing college {{football}} for Louisiana State University (LSU), Taylor led the Southeastern Conference (SEC) in scoring in 1956 and 1957 and earned first-team All-America honors as a senior. He {{was selected by}} the Packers {{in the second round}} of the 1958 NFL Draft and was used sparingly as a rookie, but with the arrival of coach Vince Lombardi in 1959 Taylor soon became the team's all-purpose back, especially when only a few yards were needed. In this role, his <b>spirited</b> performance against the Giants in the 1962 NFL Championship Game came to define his mental and physical toughness.|$|E
5|$|The Pandavas {{complete}} 12 {{years of}} forest {{life as a}} part of their 13-year exile stipulation of a rigged dice game they were defeated in by the Kauravas. As per the rule, in the 13th year, Pandavas and their wife Draupadi have to assume different identities and live incognito until the upcoming Vijayadashami. In case their real identity is unveiled, they have to repeat their 12-year exile again. That would give a chance to the Kauravas to prohibit Pandavas from attacking and gaining the reigns of the Kuru Kingdom for a longer period, and possibly forever. Pandavas choose the Matsya Kingdom ruled by Virata, a kind hearted but weak <b>spirited</b> king. They hope to find employment in the king's palace.|$|E
5|$|The college's {{students}} {{became known}} as free <b>spirited</b> outsiders within the university for their different dress, apathetic demeanor, and greater interest in reading books. The college's demographics were {{unlike the rest of}} the university, with students largely not from Wisconsin and disproportionately of Jewish and East Coast families. The college developed a reputation for radicalism and wanton anarchy, especially within Wisconsin. The students lived and worked with their teachers, called advisers, in Adams Hall, away from the heart of the university. They had no fixed schedule, no compulsory lessons, and no semesterly grades, though they read from a common syllabus. The advisers taught primarily through tutorial instead of lectures. Extracurricular groups, including philosophy, law, and theater clubs, were entirely student-led.|$|E
5|$|The senate {{attempted}} to use Caligula's death {{as an opportunity}} to restore the republic. Chaerea tried to persuade the military to support the senate. The military, though, remained loyal to the idea of imperial monarchy. The grieving Roman people assembled and demanded that Caligula's murderers be brought to justice. Uncomfortable with lingering imperial support, the assassins sought out and stabbed Caligula's wife, Caesonia, and killed their young daughter, Julia Drusilla, by smashing her head against a wall. They were unable to reach Caligula's uncle, Claudius; after a soldier, Gratus, found Claudius hiding behind a palace curtain he was <b>spirited</b> out of the city by a sympathetic faction of the Praetorian Guard to the nearby Praetorian camp.|$|E
5|$|Dora Caroline Stevens {{was born}} on October 26, 1888 in Omaha, Nebraska to Caroline D. (née Koopman) and Henry Henderbourck Stevens.

5|$|In 1969 {{the large}} Allied Breweries combine {{initiated}} a {{hostile takeover bid}} for Boddingtons, which valued the company at £5million. Charles Boddington took {{the unusual step of}} issuing a <b>spirited</b> defence of the company to the shareholders: You will be only too aware that present-day pressures bear heavily towards the elimination of individuality and character in many consumer goods. There is an inexorable progression towards the mass-produced nationwide product of standardised quality. You, however, are still, at this moment in time, a shareholder in one of the remaining independent brewery companies whose traditional draught beers have a reputation for quality and individual character beyond the immediate area of the North of England in which we operate... The takeover of Boddingtons and its consequent elimination can achieve very little. It will do nothing for the national economy, add nothing to the nation's exports, and contribute nothing at all to the quality of life that we are all used to enjoy.|$|E
5|$|In a Victorian village, Victor Van Dort, {{the son of}} nouveau riche fish merchants, and Victoria Everglot, the {{neglected}} {{daughter of}} snobbish yet impoverished aristocrats, are preparing for their arranged marriage, which will simultaneously raise the social class of Victor's parents and restore the wealth of Victoria's penniless family. Both have concerns about marrying someone they do not know, but upon meeting for the first time, they fall for each other. After the shy Victor ruins the wedding rehearsal by forgetting his vows, he flees and practices his wedding vows in the nearby forest, placing the wedding ring on a nearby upturned tree root. The root {{turns out to be}} the finger of a murdered woman in a tattered bridal gown named Emily, who rises from the grave claiming that she is now Victor's wife. After fainting, Victor wakes up and finds himself <b>spirited</b> away to the Land of the Dead. The bewildered Victor learns the story of how Emily was murdered years ago by an unknown perpetrator on the night of her secret elopement.|$|E
