5000|$|During the War, and {{immediately}} after, {{attempts were made}} to cast rifled Rodman guns. Unsuccessful {{attempts were made to}} cast a 12-inch rifle in 1861, an 8-inch rifle in 1862, and another 12-inch rifle in 1868. However Robert Parker Parrott at the Cold Springs Foundry near the United States Army Military Academy at West Point used the Rodman water core method of casting to produce large bore rifled guns in 200, 300, and 400 pound models. Parrott rifles that had been cast using the Rodman method were inscribed with the initials WC in order to differentiate those guns from ones that had been cast using ordinary methods. Primarily these guns were used on naval vessels especially large monitors.In the 1870s and 1880s efforts focused on converting existing Rodman guns into rifles. 10-inch Rodman smoothbore guns were converted into 8-inch rifles. The first method used was inserting a wrought iron rifle sleeve through the muzzle, a similar <b>steel</b> <b>sleeve</b> was also used later. The last method involved drilling and tapping the breech of the 10-inch Rodman and inserting a rifled <b>steel</b> <b>sleeve</b> and screwing it in tight with a threaded breech plug. These breech inserted guns are easily recognized by the square [...] "cascabel" [...] which was designed to provide purchase for screwing the breech plug and liner securely into the gun.|$|E

5000|$|By 1925, all Panhard's {{cars were}} powered by Knight sleeve valve engines that used <b>steel</b> <b>sleeves.</b> [...] The <b>steel</b> <b>sleeves</b> were thinner and {{lighter than the}} cast iron ones that had been fitted in Panhard sleeve valve engines since 1910, and this already gave rise to an {{improved}} friction coefficient permitting engines to run at higher speeds. [...] To reduce further the risk of engines jamming, the outer sleeves, which are less thermally stressed than the inner sleeves, were coated on their inner sides with an anti-friction material, employing a patented technique with which Panhard engineers had been working since 1923. This {{was one of several}} improvements applied by Panhard engineers to the basic Knight sleeve-valve engine concept.|$|R
50|$|Concussion grenades {{are best}} used in {{enclosed}} spaces such as buildings or bunkers, which contain the blast for maximum effect; anti-personnel fragmentation grenades {{are designed to}} be effective against personnel in the open. The Splitterring was a simple cylindrical <b>steel</b> <b>sleeve,</b> with either a smooth or serrated surface, clipped in place over the head of a stick grenade with three keepers around the base, and secured with a tension ring. This easy modification allowed a single type of grenade to be manufactured and carried by soldiers, whereas other nations often produced separate types of concussion and anti-personnel grenades.|$|E
50|$|Pyrotechnic {{compositions}} {{based on}} magnesium/polytetrafluoroethylene with stoichiometries from 25 wt% to 90 wt% magnesium are, according to German explosive legislation, the Koenen test (<b>steel</b> <b>sleeve</b> test), and BAM impact test, explosive substances. Due to their sensitivity and their reaction behaviour these substances are categorized as group 1.1.2. MTV compositions explode at minimum confinement (also self confinement) at relative low amounts. MTV compositions are sensitive toward thermal ignition.In addition MTV compositions in loose and pressed state are extraordinarily sensitive to friction and electrostatic discharges (ESD). Hence, suitable measures {{have to be}} taken to avoid ESD while processing and handling of MTV.|$|E
5000|$|There is a {{prohibition}} against using ammunition with bullet weight less than [...] {{due to the}} risk of frame erosion from powder that is still burning after too rapid exit of the light projectile. Another warning in the owners manual is recoil may pull the cases of unfired rounds in the cylinder rearward with enough force to unseat the bullets, causing the cylinder to jam. It has also been said that accuracy is compromised in these types of ultra-light revolvers since the barrel is a <b>steel</b> <b>sleeve</b> liner rather than a single solid piece of steel.|$|E

50|$|Hydraulic {{telescopic}} cylinders {{are often}} {{limited to a}} maximum hydraulic pressure of 2000-3000 psi. This is because the outward forces produced by internal hydraulic pressure tends to expand the <b>steel</b> <b>sleeve</b> sections. Too much pressure will cause the nested sleeves to balloon outward, bind the mechanism and stop moving. The danger exists that a permanent deformation of the outer diameter of a sleeve could occur, thus ruining a telescopic actuator. For this reason, {{care must be taken}} to avoid shock pressures in a hydraulic system using telescopic cylinders. Often such hydraulic systems are equipped with shock suppressing components, such as hydraulic accumulators, to absorb pressure spikes.|$|E
50|$|The M16 mine is a U.S.-made {{bounding}} anti-personnel mine. It {{was based}} on captured plans of the World War II era German S-mine and has similar performance. The mine consists of a cast iron body in a thin <b>steel</b> <b>sleeve.</b> A central fuze well {{on the top of}} the mine is normally fitted with a pronged M605 pressure and tilt fuze. Sufficient pressure on the prongs or tension on an attached tripwire causes the release of a striker. The freed striker is forced into a percussion cap which ignites a short pyrotechnic delay. The purpose of this delay is to allow the victim to move off the top of the mine, to prevent its upward movement from being blocked. Once the delay has burned through, a 4.5-gram black powder charge is ignited, which launches the inner iron body of the mine up into the air (leaving behind the steel outer sleeve). The charge also ignites a second pair of pyrotechnic delays.|$|E

40|$|An {{anchorage}} {{system for}} the tensile load transmission on the circular rods/tendons made from high-strength pultruded composites is proposed. The anchorage system comprises a composite rod having a spitted end with an inserted and glued metal wedge, a metal sleeve and pottant material, connecting composite rod and sleeve. The main objective of the system proposed is reduction of high stress concentration at the loaded end, which is typical for the bond-type anchor systems. The detailed analysis of 3 D stress-strain state of the anchor was performed for pultruded CFRP/epoxy rod, <b>steel</b> <b>sleeve,</b> aluminum wedge and epoxy resin pottant. All calculations were made with finite element method accounting for elastic and elastic-plastic behavior of epoxy resin in shear. The principal conclusion resulting from these FEM calculations implies that stress concentration at the loaded end of the anchor system keeps independently of the wedge location if the adhesive bond between composite rod and pottant is available. The possible technical solution of this problem may be creation of a friction interface between composite rod and pottant within the anchorage length. To verify this suggestion, 3 D contact FEM problems for the anchor system with the various lengths of friction interface were considered and analyzed. A series of the uniaxial tensile tests were carried out for the anchor systems made with CFRP pultruded rods of 5. 5 mm diameter, <b>steel</b> <b>sleeve</b> of 300 mm length, A 1 wedge of 110 mm length and cone angle of 7 ° embedded into epoxy resin. These experiments confirmed the working capacity of the anchor system proposed to transfer the tensile load on the high-strength UD CFRP/epoxy rod made by pultrusion. Failure of these CFRP rods was observed at the gauge section and maximum tensile stress of 2038 MPa. The anchor systems were fabricated with adhesive bond and only friction interaction between composite rod and pottant...|$|E

40|$|Structural {{steel is}} a {{material}} {{that allows for}} slender columns. However, slender steel columns usually have a low load bearing resistance due to flexural buckling. It is possible to suppress flexural column buckling by adding glass panes.

In this paper, a new type of slender transparent glass-steel column is proposed, consisting of a high strength steel bar supported in lateral direction by glass panes. Its feasibility is shown experimentally and numerically. It is also shown that the design has sufficient redundancy to allow for the loss of supporting glass panes without a reduction of the load bearing capacity. The key design feature of this glass-steel column is the way the glass panes are connected to the steel bar, namely by sliding <b>steel</b> <b>sleeves</b> to avoid direct stresses to occur in the glass panes due to axial column deformation...|$|R
