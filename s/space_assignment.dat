40|$|Traditionally, the satisability {{problem for}} propositional logics deals with {{formulas}} in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF). A typical {{way to deal}} with non-CNF formulas requires (i) converting them into CNF, and (ii) applying solvers usually based on the Davis-Putnam (DP) procedure.

A multitude of requirements such as technological dependencies, resource and work <b>space</b> <b>assignment</b> have to be considered.

A realistic planning and detailed analysis will help to reduce the on-site coordination effort and not to overrun the projected costs and time. Appropriate tools have to be implemented to support planners and improve the outfitting planning. Within the cooperation SIMoFIT (Simulation of Outfitting Processes in Shipbuilding and Civil Engineering) a discrete-event simulation framework is developing to support outfitting planning in shipbuilding and civil engineering. This paper focuses on using a constraint-based simulation approach to detail outfitting tasks and their corresponding restrictions and requirements.

40|$|The {{quadratic}} assignment problem (QAP) {{is known}} as one of the most interesting and challenging problems in combinatorial optimization. This dissertation contributes to the theoretical, algorithmic and applicable understanding of quadratic assignment and its related problems. ^ The study includes four areas: (i) investigating the inherent relationship of the 3 -dimensional assignment problem (3 AP) to the quadratic assignment problem (QAP) and the quadratic 3 -dimensional assignment problem (Q 3 AP); (ii) understanding the level- 1 reformulation-linearization technique (RLT) formulation of the generalized quadratic assignment problem (GQAP) and comparing lower bounds from different RLT based models; (iii) modeling new applications of the multi-story <b>space</b> <b>assignment</b> problem (MSAP) and the crossdock door assignment problem (CDAP), and developing solution methods for an innovative assignment problem, the generalized quadratic 3 -dimensional assignment problem (GQ 3 AP); and (iv) introducing the level- 3 RLT formulation of the QAP for the first time and illustrating its great promise to provide superior lower bounds. ^ Solution methodologies studied in this work include the reformulation-linearization technique (RLT), Lagrangian dual procedure, and branch-and-bound enumeration. The methods devised herein effectively exploit the mathematical structure found within the RLT formulations. This consists of both theoretical and computational studies, including specially designed Lagrangian dual procedures that take advantage of the block-diagonal structures, and tradeoffs between linearization size and strength. Computational experiments were conducted by either implementing or extending the usefulness of existing algorithmic tools to solve application problems. ...|$|E
40|$|Wireless content caching {{in small}} cell {{networks}} (SCNs) {{has recently been}} considered as {{an efficient way to}} reduce the traffic and the energy consumption of the backhaul in emerging heterogeneous cellular networks (HetNets). In this paper, we consider a cluster-centric SCN with combined design of cooperative caching and transmission policy. Small base stations (SBSs) are grouped into disjoint clusters, in which in-cluster cache space is utilized as an entity. We propose a combined caching scheme where part of the available cache space is reserved for caching the most popular content in every SBS, while the remaining is used for cooperatively caching different partitions of the less popular content in different SBSs, as a means to increase local content diversity. Depending on the availability and placement of the requested content, coordinated multipoint (CoMP) technique with either joint transmission (JT) or parallel transmission (PT) is used to deliver content to the served user. Using Poisson point process (PPP) for the SBS location distribution and a hexagonal grid model for the clusters, we provide analytical results on the successful content delivery probability of both transmission schemes for a user located at the cluster center. Our analysis shows an inherent tradeoff between transmission diversity and content diversity in our combined caching-transmission design. We also study optimal cache <b>space</b> <b>assignment</b> for two objective functions: maximization of the cache service performance and the energy efficiency. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves performance gain by leveraging cache-level and signal-level cooperation and adapting to the network environment and user QoS requirements.

40|$|A {{coarse-grained}} molecular simulation for block copolymers in the entangled {{state is}} proposed {{as an extension}} of the primitive chain network model. Polymers are represented as a sequence of segments between consecutive entanglements, the latter being modeled as sliplinks with other chains. Each sliplink connects two chains only, i. e., entanglements are taken as â€˜binaryâ€™. The resulting 3 D structure is a network of primitive chains, which makes our model different from other sliplink single-chain models, where the link to other chains is â€˜virtualâ€™. The 3 D nature of our simulation makes it similar to, though considerably more coarse grained than, conventional molecular dynamics simulations. Because of the 3 D <b>space</b> <b>assignment</b> of the polymers, monomeric density fields can be defined, and interactions due to different chemistry of the monomers can be accounted for, similarly to density field calculations. Polymer motion is described both by the 3 D motion of sliplinks, and by the 1 D transport of monomers along the primitive chain, while network topological rearrangement occurs due to chain-end hooking and unhooking processes. Each kinetic equation accounts for elastic forces along the chains, field forces arising from density gradients, and thermal random forces. In this paper, the primitive chain network model was modified (i) in the procedure of network rearrangement to account for the different chemistries in the copolymer, and (ii) in some details of the kinetic equations whenever the boundary between blocks is involved. We report results for diblock copolymers where for simplicity all relevant properties of the two monomers are the same, except for the interactions. Simulations reasonably reproduce the micro-phase formation process and the phase diagram for well entangled copolymers with a low calculation cost...|$|E

In this work, we consider clustering dynamics to mitigate such ambiguities. This leads to a general optimization framework that adds social grouping behavior (SGB) to any basic affinity model.
