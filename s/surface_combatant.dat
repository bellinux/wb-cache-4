Band is a proponent for the Sustained <b>surface</b> <b>combatant</b> capability {{and the creation of}} new ships to maintain the Royal Navy as one of the world's leading navies. These include the new Type 45 destroyer and the Royal Navy CVF programme, designed to replace the UK's current aircraft carriers.|$|E

50|$|Sweden had a {{total of}} 35 destroyer-class vessels {{throughout}} the Cold War, most of them World War II models. As time went on, Sweden begun to put less effort in keeping large <b>surface</b> <b>combatants</b> and instead increasingly relied on patrol boats, fast attack craft, coastal artillery and air superiority. However this approach (especially the overreliance on lighter <b>surface</b> <b>combatants)</b> was somewhat discredited by the early 1980s. Attempts were then made to move back towards heavier more capable <b>surface</b> <b>combatants</b> (e.g. the Ytstridsfartyg Större Combatant Large program), but this was ultimately curtailed by the sudden end to the Cold War.|$|R

25|$|As {{a part of}} a plan to {{strengthen}} the <b>surface</b> <b>combatant</b> forces, the ROK Navy launched the lead ship of the Gwanggaeto the Great class destroyer in 1996 to replace the former U.S. Navy destroyers. For building up a submarine force, the ROK Navy purchased its first submarine (other than midget submarines), the Chang Bogo (SS 061), from Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft of Germany in 1992. In order to replace its antiquated S-2 Tracker anti-submarine warfare airplanes, South Korea purchased a squadron of P-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft. These were delivered to the ROK Navy starting in 1995.|$|E

In 2010 BAE Systems were given a four-year contract to fully design {{a new class of}} warship, the Type 26 or ‘Global Combat Ship.’ The 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review announced that the Royal Navy would procure 13 of the vessels, however repeated delays saw the program scaled back to eight vessels with five smaller Type 31 warships also ordered.|$|E

However, by March 2010, this procurement programme had evolved to become the Global Combat Ship, following the announcement of a four-year, £127 million design contract being awarded to BAE Systems Maritime – Naval Ships. The design passed Main Gate 1 in early 2015, with the Demonstration Phase starting 1 April 2015. In August 2015 the first long lead items for Type 26 were ordered, with manufacturing then expected to begin in 2016 and the first Type 26 to be delivered in 2023. In November 2016 {{it was announced that}} first steel would be cut for the eight Royal Navy ships in summer 2017.

25|$|John Finn is the 63rd Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, {{the first}} of which, , was {{commissioned}} in July 1991. With 75 ships planned {{to be built in}} total, the class has the longest production run for any U.S. Navy <b>surface</b> <b>combatant.</b> As an Arleigh Burke-class ship, John Finns roles included anti-aircraft, anti-submarine, and anti-surface warfare, as well as strike operations. During its long production run, the class was built in three flights: Flight I (DDG-51–DDG-71), Flight II (DDG-72–DDG-78), and Flight IIA (DDG-79–DDG-126). John Finn will be a Flight IIA ship, and as such, will feature several improvements in terms of ballistic missile defense, an embarked air wing (two MH-60R Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System helicopters), and the inclusion of mine-detecting ability. DDG-51 was also the first class of ships in the U.S. Navy to include anti-NBC (Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical) warfare protection.|$|E
25|$|The {{governments of}} the United Kingdom and Australia had {{previously}} been exploring the potential for cooperation on the C1 and C3 designs of the Future <b>Surface</b> <b>Combatant,</b> which corresponded closely to the Royal Australian Navy's requirements in replacing its Anzac-class frigates with {{a new class of}} frigate. The two countries signed a defence cooperation treaty in January 2013 and Australia pledged cooperation on the Global Combat Ship design in order to investigate its suitability for their own procurement programme. In April 2016, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull confirmed that the Global Combat Ship was one of three designs shortlisted for the replacement of Anzac-class frigates. In September 2016 the Australian government awarded BAE Systems a contract to further refine the design of the Type 26 Global Combat Ship for the Royal Australian Navy under the SEA 5000 (Future Frigate) programme. Australia issued a request for tenders (RFT) in support of the programme in late March 2017 and a decision on the successful designer is expected in 2018. The programme is valued at AUD35 billion (USD26.25 billion). On 10 August 2017 BAE Systems announced it had submitted its bid for the SEA 5000 (Future Frigate) programme.|$|E

500|$|Several new wartime {{classes were}} proposed, {{including}} the American [...] and the Japanese Design B-65 class. The Alaskas were officially classified as [...] "large cruisers", but many naval historians {{refer to them}} as battlecruisers. Only two of the American ships were built {{before the end of the}} war. In the postwar drawdown of forces, Renown and the two Alaskas were withdrawn from service and eventually scrapped; Yavuz Sultan Selim, the last surviving battlecruiser in the world, lingered on until the early 1970s, when she too was sent to the shipbreakers. Only one country, the Soviet Union, considered building battlecruisers after the war. The three [...] ships, championed by Joseph Stalin, were laid down in the early 1950s, but were cancelled after his death in 1953. However, in the 1970s, the Soviet Union began the construction of a class of very large guided missile cruisers, much larger than any other <b>surface</b> <b>combatant</b> built since the Second World War.

50|$|Although a {{development}} of CY-1, CY-2 {{is not exactly}} the replacement of CY-1 and the two are used concurrently by the Chinese navy. One {{of the reason is}} that due to space limitation, most of the light <b>surface</b> <b>combatants</b> of the Chinese navy cannot accommodate the large complex sonars on board larger warships. The range of smaller sonars on these light <b>surface</b> <b>combatants</b> of in Chinese navy is less than that of CY-2, and thus the longer range of CY-2 can not be fully exploited if it is on board these smaller <b>surface</b> <b>combatants.</b> As a result, CY-1 remains on board submarine chasers where rocket propelled ASW torpedoes (or ASW rockets) are deployed, while CY-2 is often deployed on larger warships. Another reason for keep CY-1 in the inventory is that CY-1 can be put away and stored like a log without maintenance for sometime, but CY-2 requires periodically maintenance in storage. CY-2 entered Chinese service at the end of 2006.|$|R
