40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to develop an implementation framework for an online after-sales service platform with a special focus on spare part supply. The research design is a single in-depth case study with multiple units of analysis. Data was collected based on mixed-method. Internal interviews and observation were used. Further, a customer survey was conducted and generic benchmarking with two other companies was performed. The results from the customer survey suggest information quality is preeminent for the provision of after-sales relevant information online. Information must be complete, correct and up-dated. The system quality fosters the acquisition of information, stimulates self-service and is predominant for spare part <b>ordering.</b> <b>Service</b> <b>quality</b> was not found to be of great significance. Extensive literature review has been composed related to the three key elements of this study. Firstly, the after-sales management was examined and relevant elements for the online platform were detected. Secondly, product information management was considered as vital for the spare part provision and for the e-commerce implementation. Thirdly, e-business, e-commerce and e-services were illuminated. As a result, an implementation framework was developed and tested. This research presents both theoretical and managerial contributions...|$|R
40|$|Western {{scholars}} consider community <b>service</b> <b>order</b> as {{the best}} alternative to rehabilitate offenders. However, Muslim jurists never debated the concept of community <b>service</b> <b>order</b> {{as a form of}} punishment in the Islamic judicial system. Accordingly, this article seeks to analyze the concept of community <b>service</b> <b>order</b> in the context of Islamic law by making a comparison between the concept of community <b>service</b> <b>order</b> as debated by Western scholars with the concept of ta`zir punishment by their Muslim counterpart. This aspect is analysed as an alternative concept of punishment, the discretionary power of judges, theory, or concept of the fundamental goals of punishment and penance. The research discovers that there are many similarities between the concept of community <b>service</b> <b>order</b> with the concept of punishment in Islamic ta`zir. This research is significant as it potrays that the implementation of community <b>service</b> <b>order</b> practised today is a sentence that is consistent with Islamic law...|$|R
