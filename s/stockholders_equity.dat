The results are as follows: Firms with repurchase purpose for <b>stockholder's</b> <b>equity</b> have higher short-run and long-run returns than those with repurchase purpose for transfer to employees. Firms with repurchase purpose for <b>stockholder's</b> <b>equity</b> have higher stock prices fall down ratio before repurchase announcement than those with repurchase purpose for transfer to employees. The signaling strength of stock repurchases announced by firms with high book-to-market ratio is more powerful. And those firms also have higher short-run and long-run returns. The correlation between the percentage of shares mortgaged by directors of firms with repurchases purpose for <b>stockholder's</b> <b>equity</b> and the short-run return of treasury stock repurchases is negative. The correlation between the percentage of shares mortgaged by directors of firms with repurchases purpose for <b>stockholder's</b> <b>equity</b> and the long-run return of treasury stock repurchases is positive. The stock prices fall down ratio before repurchase announcement has significantly positive correlation with the short-run returns. The repurchase ratio has positive correlation with the short-run returns in firms with repurchase purpose for <b>stockholder's</b> <b>equity</b> and repurchase purpose for transfer to employees. The correlation between the percentage of insider shareholding of firms with repurchases purpose for transfer to employees and the long-run return of treasury stock repurchases is positive. 本論文研究是探討台灣上市公司之規模、淨值市價比、前期跌幅、預定買回比率、內部人持股比、董監質押比率與長、短期報酬間的關聯性。實證結果如下：為維護股東權益與信用目的長短期報酬皆大於買回目的為轉讓股份予員工的長短期報酬。買回目的為維護股東信用與權益的前期跌幅大於買回目的為轉讓股份予員工的前期跌幅。高淨值市價比的公司之庫藏股購回宣告傳遞較強之訊號，其長短期報酬也較高。買回目的為維護股東信用與權益，董監質押比率與庫藏股購回之短期報酬間具有反向關係，與長期報酬則具有正向關係。前期跌幅與短期報酬呈現顯著正相關。不論何種買回目的，買回比率與短期報酬為正相關係，買回目的為轉讓股份予員工，內部人持股與長期報酬具有正向關係。第一章 緒論	 1 第一節 研究動機	 1 第二章 文獻探討	 3 第一節 主要理論基礎與實證研究	 3 第二節 其他理論基礎與實證研究	 4 第三章 研究設計與方法	 5 第一節 變數定義與衡量	 5 第二節 研究方法	 5 第三節 研究期間及資料來源、樣本選取	 8 第四章 實證結果分析	 9 第一節 研究樣本說明	 9 第二節 不同買回目的庫藏股購回之長短期報酬分析	 13 第三節 以不同目的基礎下之規模大小之長短期分析	 17 第四節 不同淨值市價比之長短期分析	 20 第五節 預定買回比率高低之長短期報酬	 22 第六節 以不同買回目的為基礎下，探討前期跌幅之短期報酬	 25 第七節 以不同買回目的為基礎下內部人持股比率之長短期報酬	 27 第八節 不同買回目的為基礎下董監質押比率不同之長短期報酬分析	 30 第五章 迴歸分析	 33 第一節 相關係數分析	 33 第二節 迴歸分析	 35 第三節 結論與建議	 35 參考文獻 	 38 表目錄 Table 1 庫藏股購回樣本分析	 10 Table 2 前期股價與本益比跌幅	 14 Table 3 短期之異常報酬率	 16 Table 4 短期之累積異常報酬率	 17 Table 5 長期之累積異常報酬率	 17 Table 6 買回目的為轉讓予員工之規模大小短期分析	 17 Table 7 買回目的為維護股東權益與信用，探討規模大小之短期報酬	 18 Table 8 買回目的為轉讓予員工基礎下，不同規模之長期報酬	 19 Table 9 以買回目的維護股東信用與權益為基礎下，不同規模大小之長期報酬	 19 Table 10 買回目的為轉讓予員工之不同淨值市價比之短期報酬	 20 Table 11 買回目的為維護股東權益與信用之不同淨值市價比之短期報酬	 20 Table 12 以買回目的轉讓股份予員工為基礎下，不同淨值市價比之長期報酬	 21 Table 13 以買回目的維護股東權益與信用為基礎，不同淨值市價比之長期報酬	 21 Table 14 買回為轉讓股份予員工預定買回比率之短期報酬	 22 Table 15 買回目的為維護股東與權益預定買回比率之短期報酬	 23 Table 16 以買回為轉讓股份予員工為基礎下，不同買回比率之長期報酬	 24 Table 17 以買回為維護股東與權益為基礎下，不同買回比率之長期報酬	 24 Table 18 以買回為轉讓股份予員工為基礎，前期跌幅之短期報酬	 25 Table 19 以買回目的為維護股東權益與信用基礎下，探討前期跌幅之短期報酬	 25 Table 20 買回為轉讓股份予員工為基礎，跌幅大小之長期報酬	 26 Table 21 買回為維護股東權益與信用為基礎，跌幅大小之長期報酬	 26 Table 22 以買回為轉讓股份予員工為基礎下不同內部人持股比率之短期報酬	 27 Table 23 買回為維護股東權益與信用為基礎下不同內部人持股比率之短期報酬	 27 Table 24 買回為轉讓股份予員工基礎下不同持股比率之長期報酬	 28 Table 25 買回為維護股東權益與信用基礎下不同持股比率之長期報酬	 29 Table 26 買回目的為轉讓股份予員工基礎下，不同董監質押比率之短期報酬分析	 30 Table 27 以維護股東權益與信用基礎下，不同董監質押比率之短期報酬分析	 30 Table 28 目的為轉讓股份予員工為基礎下，不同董監質押比率之長期報酬分析	 31 Table 29 目的為維護股東權益與信用基礎下，不同董監質押比率之長期報酬分析	 31 Table 30 迴歸分析各變數間之相關係數分析	 33 Table 31 累積異常報酬率與變數之迴歸分析	 34 圖目錄 Fig 1. 1 維護股東權益與信用為目的之年分佈圖	 10 Fig 1. 2 轉讓股份予員工為目的之年分佈圖	 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this master’s thesis is to conduct a {{valuation}} of the common <b>stockholder</b> <b>equity</b> in Marine Harvest on December 31, 2016. The valuation {{will be based on}} a fundamental valuation, supplemented by a method of comparables. In the fundamental valuation we have identified the underlying economic conditions of Marine Harvest, in order to forecast the pro forma financial statement. The discounted cash flows are then used to provide an estimated value. In the method of comparables we have used the method of multiples to provide a supplementary valuation. To provide the reader with the insight required for the thesis, we start with a presentation of the fish farming industry and Marine Harvest. The first part of the fundamental valuation is a strategic analysis of Marine Harvest. Using the PESTEL analysis and Porter's five forces, we reveal opportunities and threats to the fish farming industry. We use the SVIMA framework to conduct an analysis of the resources of Marine Harvest. The results of the strategic analysis are used to identify the sources of the historical strategic advantage of 13. 3 %. In Chapters 9 and 10, we forecast the pro forma financial statement based on the normalized financial statements from the accounting analysis. Our calculations give Marine Harvest a future strategic advantage of 6. 9 %. We then prepared value estimates using the equity method, the capital employed method and the net operating requirement method. After a convergence of the value estimates and an analysis of uncertainty, we concluded with an estimated value of 130, 053 NOK per share. Our final estimate using the method of comparables was NOK 154. 26 per share. By weighting the fundamental value estimate by 70 % and the comparative value estimate by 30 %, we concluded with a final value estimate of 137. 32 NOK per share and thus a sell recommendation...|$|R

40|$|In {{the first}} essay, I examine {{the role of}} {{personal}} and corporate income taxation on asset prices in a general equilibrium model featuring limited stock market participation. Taxes are modeled to redistribute income from stockholders, who are relatively richer, to non-stockholders. Under heavier taxation of <b>stockholders,</b> the <b>equity</b> premium rises and the risk-free rate drops. This effect is driven by an increased concentration of consumption risk among stockholders, who then demand a higher premium for bearing the aggregate equity risk. In {{a version of the}} model with a realistically calibrated proportional corporate income tax as well as a progressive personal income tax schedule, I find that the redistributive properties of the income tax system are responsible for a one percentage point increase in the after-tax equity risk premium compared to an economy without taxes. In the second essay (joint with Nam Jong Kim), we study asset prices, exchange rates, and consumption dynamics in a general equilibrium two-county macroeconomic model that features limited stock market participation as well as non-traded goods and distribution cost. The model generates a high price of risk, smooth exchange rates, and makes substantial progress towards explaining the empirically observed low consumption growth correlation between countries. We find that distribution cost play a central role for reducing international consumption co-movement while also amplifying risk premia...|$|R
