From the expression derived for effective <b>sieving</b> technology, {{it was discovered that}} <b>sieve</b> aperture is directly proportional to <b>sieving</b> speed but inversely proportional to operators strain.

25|$|With {{increasing}} attention {{being paid}} to saving energy, many methods have been proposed that avoid distillation altogether for dehydration. Of these methods, a third method has emerged and has been adopted {{by the majority of}} modern ethanol plants. This new process uses molecular <b>sieves</b> to remove water from fuel ethanol. In this process, ethanol vapor under pressure passes through a bed of molecular sieve beads. The bead's pores are sized to allow adsorption of water while excluding ethanol. After a period of time, the bed is regenerated under vacuum or in the flow of inert atmosphere (e.g. N2) to remove the adsorbed water. Two beds are often used so that one is available to adsorb water while the other is being regenerated. This dehydration technology can account for energy saving of 3,000 btus/gallon (840 kJ/L) compared to earlier azeotropic distillation.|$|E

25|$|When the Lucy Tongue Level was {{completed}} in 1869, its entrance was below the ore hoppers {{at the foot of}} the incline from the Low Horse Level. A water-powered incline was built to take the ore up to those hoppers, though this involved a considerable amount of reorganisation in the area. Labour shortages in 1870 led to further mechanisation of the labour-intensive ore washing. A new oscillating jaw crusher eliminated the need for initial hand-knocking of the ore, and was powered by a high-pressure water turbine. Hotching tubs, even when mechanised, still needed constant supervision, and were replaced by newly-available automated fixed-sieve jigging machines. These still involved forcing water up and down through the bed of ore, but the <b>sieves,</b> covered with a three-inch (76mm) layer of galena, were stationary; material of the same density passed through the bed but lighter material was washed into the next sieve down the line. They were very effective and enabled a complete separation of galena and gangue.|$|E
25|$|Most sieve {{analyses}} {{are carried out}} dry. But there are some applications {{which can only be}} carried out by wet sieving. This is the case when the sample which has to be analysed is e.g. a suspension which must not be dried; or when the sample is a very fine powder which tends to agglomerate (mostly < 45nbsp&µm) – in a dry sieving process this tendency would lead to a clogging of the sieve meshes and this would make a further sieving process impossible. A wet sieving process is set up like a dry process: the sieve stack is clamped onto the sieve shaker and the sample is placed on the top sieve. Above the top sieve a water-spray nozzle is placed which supports the sieving process additionally to the sieving motion. The rinsing is carried out until the liquid which is discharged through the receiver is clear. Sample residues on the <b>sieves</b> have to be dried and weighed. When it comes to wet sieving it is very important not to change the sample in its volume (no swelling, dissolving or reaction with the liquid).|$|E
25|$|The feeding {{was done}} {{through the use}} of specially-constructed small wooden boxes, 4cm by 7cm, {{developed}} by Weigl. The boxes were sealed with paraffin on the top which prevented the lice from escaping, and the underside consisted of a screen made of a fabric sieve, adopted by Weigl from <b>sieves</b> that were used by local peasants to separate wheat husks from the seeds. A typical box contained 400 to 800 lice larvae which would mature as the feeding took place. The sieve bottom allowed the lice to stick out their heads and feed on the human flesh. A standard feeding period took thirty to forty-five minutes, and was repeated with the same lice colony for twelve days. Usually, an individual feeder would accommodate from 7 to 11 boxes (of 400 to 800 lice each) on his or her leg, per feeding session. Typically men would place the boxes on their calves, to minimize the discomfort of the bites, while women feeders placed them on their thighs, so that the bite marks could be covered up by a skirt. A nurse had to watch over the feeding process as the lice would feed beyond the point of being gorged on the blood and could burst if left on the human flesh for too long.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Botany, Washington State UniversityThe {{distribution}} of photosynthetically derived assimilates through plants occurs in specialized cells called <b>sieve</b> {{elements that are}} connected to each other forming a microfluidic system within the plant. <b>Sieve</b> elements were discovered over 150 years ago, however their in vivo structure and complete assimilate transport properties eludes clarification. Microscopic investigation of <b>sieve</b> elements requires tissue manipulations that disrupt the natural state of translocating <b>sieve</b> elements resulting in interpretations of <b>sieve</b> element ultrastructure. Construed <b>sieve</b> element structures accommodate the osmotic pressure flow hypothesis. Assimilates are postulated to passively flow through <b>sieve</b> elements {{as a result of}} osmotically generated pressure differences from source to sink. The assimilate stream characteristics are considered to adhere to physical parameters of the <b>sieve</b> element geometry. For this theory to hold the <b>sieve</b> elements must be free major of obstructions.
