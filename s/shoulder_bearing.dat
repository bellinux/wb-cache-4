60|$|The man was young, perhaps six {{or eight}} and twenty years of age. His dark skin, burnt almost to {{blackness}} by {{the heat of the}} sun, together with the fashion of his short, square-cut beard and of his garments, proclaimed him of Jewish or Egyptian blood, while the gold collar about his neck and the gold graven ring upon his hand showed that his rank was high.

6000|$|In {{a year or}} two poor Mr. Toothaker {{was visited}} with a wearisome {{infirmity}} which settled in his joints and made him weaker than a child. He crept forth about his business, and came home at dinner-time and eventide, not with the manly tread that gladdens a wife's heart, but slowly, feebly, jotting down each dull footstep with a melancholy dub of his staff. We must pardon his pretty wife if she sometimes blushed to own him. Her visitors, when they heard him coming, looked for the appearance of some old, old man, but he dragged his nerveless limbs into the parlor--and there was Mr. Toothaker! The disease increasing, he never went into the sunshine save with a staff in his right hand and his left on his wife's <b>shoulder,</b> <b>bearing</b> heavily downward like a dead man's hand. Thus, a slender woman still looking maiden-like, she supported his tall, broad-chested frame along the pathway of their little garden, and plucked the roses for her gray-haired husband, and spoke soothingly as to an infant. His mind was palsied with his body; its utmost energy was peevishness. In a few months more she helped him up the staircase with a pause at every step, and a longer one upon the landing-place, and a heavy glance behind as he crossed the threshold of his chamber. He knew, poor man! that the precincts of those four walls would thenceforth be his world--his world, his home, his tomb, at once a dwelling-and a burial-place--till he were borne to a darker and a narrower one. But Rose was with him in the tomb. He leaned upon her in his daily passage from the bed to the chair by the fireside, and back again from the weary chair to the joyless bed--his bed and hers, their marriage-bed--till even this short journey ceased and his head lay all day upon the pillow and hers all night beside it. How long poor Mr. Toothaker was kept in misery! Death seemed to draw near the door, and often to lift the latch, and sometimes to thrust his ugly skull into the chamber, nodding to Rose and pointing at her husband, but still delayed to enter. [...] "This bedridden wretch cannot escape me," [...] quoth Death. [...] "I will go forth and run a race with the swift and fight a battle with the strong, and come back for Toothaker at my leisure." [...] Oh, when the deliverer came so near, in the dull anguish of her worn-out sympathies did she never long to cry, [...] "Death, come in"? ...|$|E

By replacing the EMU's fiberglass Hard Upper Torso (HUT) section with a soft upper torso, or SUT, and by using lightweight titanium in place of stainless steel for load-bearing metal components, the I-suit weighs only 65 pounds (29 kg) without its life support backpack or thermal/micrometeoroid layer, compared to 107 lbs (49 kg) for the EMU. The suit also features a graphite-epoxy <b>shoulder</b> <b>bearing</b> housing, demonstrating {{the use of this}} material in place of aluminum.

40|$|The passive sizing system {{consists}} {{of a series of}} low-profile pulleys attached to the front and back of the shoulder bearings on a spacesuit soft upper torso (SUT), textile cord or stainless steel cable, and a modified commercial ratchet mechanism. The cord/cable is routed through the pulleys and attached to the ratchet mechanism mounted {{on the front of the}} spacesuit within reach of the suited subject. Upon actuating the ratchet mechanism, the <b>shoulder</b> <b>bearing</b> breadth is changed, providing variable upper torso sizing. The active system {{consists of}} a series of pressurizable nastic cells embedded into the fabric layers of a spacesuit SUT. These cells are integrated to the front and back of the SUT and are connected to an air source with a variable regulator. When inflated, the nastic cells provide a change in the overall <b>shoulder</b> <b>bearing</b> breadth of the spacesuit and thus, torso sizing. The research focused on the development of a high-performance sizing and actuation system. This technology has application as a suit-sizing mechanism to allow easier suit entry and more accurate suit fit with fewer torso sizes than the existing EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) suit system. This advanced SUT will support NASA s Advanced EMU Evolutionary Concept of a two-sizes-fit-all upper torso for replacement of the current EMU hard upper torso (HUT). Both the passive and nastic sizing system approaches provide astronauts with real-time upper torso sizing, which translates into a more comfortable suit, providing enhanced fit resulting in improved crewmember performance during extravehicular activity. These systems will also benefit NASA by reducing flight logistics as well as overall suit system cost. The nastic sizing system approach provides additional structural redundancy over existing SUT designs by embedding additional coated fabric and uncoated fabric layers. Two sizing systems were selected to build into a prototype SUT: one active and one passive. From manned testing, it was found that both systems offer good solutions to sizing a SUT to fit a crewmember. This new system provided improved suit don/doff over existing spacesuit designs as well as providing better fit at suit operational pressure resulting in improved comfort and mobility. It was found that a SUT with a sizing system may solve several problems that have plagued existing HUT designs, and that a SUT with a sizing system may be a viable option for advanced suit architectures...|$|E

Model simulation parallels measured kinematics when shoulder motion is forced to follow the measured motion while hips and crutch tips are free pivots. Shoulder control contributes to increased ground clearance, influences timing and stride length, and gives flowing gait. Results indicate that mechanical work requirements during the body-swing phase are low. Metabolic energy demands exceed mechanical work re-quirements, due particularly to support of the body by the arms and shoulders.

The team's logo was the same Leaf as used by the parent club at the time, except with the words [...] "London Nationals" [...] written out across the leaf instead of [...] "Toronto Maple Leafs". After 1968, the colours changed to green, gold and white, and the logo to a classically inspired Knight's head with an Old English [...] "K" [...] on the helmet. In 1980 the striping changed slightly, from classical horizontal stripes around the sleeves {{and bottom of the}} sweater to large arm stripes and a bare sweater bottom. In 1985–86 the green on the uniforms was darkened and the arm stripes were deleted in favour of broad swathes of secondary colour across the shoulders and down the arms. 1986 saw a total re-design of sweater and logo. Black was added as a secondary colour and the striping returned to a more pedestrian design. The logo was also changed, from a classical Knight's head to a more modernized version on a gold circle with the letter [...] "L". These uniforms were used until 1994. In 1994 the green and gold were disposed of completely in favour of the eggplant and teal used by the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. The logo was changed to [...] "Spiderknight", with normal horizontal striping and pointed shoulder stripes. There was also a teal <b>shoulder</b> patch <b>bearing</b> the word [...] "London" [...] and a hockey stick. In February 2002, the Knights reverted to their 1986–94 uniforms as a commemoration of the closing of the London Gardens.

However, occasionally the numbers recovered are much larger e.g. the mass grave at Fromelles (excavated in 2009) which contained the skeletal remains of no less than 250 Allied soldiers. Another example is the excavation which took place at Carspach (Alsace region of France) in early 2012, which uncovered the remains of 21 German soldiers, lost in an underground shelter since 1918, after being buried by a large-calibre British artillery shell. Regardless, efforts are made to identify any remains found via a thorough forensic examination. If this is achieved, attempts are made to trace any living relatives. However, it is frequently impossible to identify the remains, other than to establish some basic details of the unit they served with.

Other distinguishing badges included a brass letter [...] "A" [...] which was worn on the colour patch by men and nurses who had served at Gallipoli, blue chevrons representing each year of overseas service, and a red chevron to represent enlistment {{during the first year of}} the war. Uniforms worn by the AFC were similar to those of the rest of the AIF, although some officers wore the double-breasted [...] "maternity jacket" [...] which had been worn at the pre-war Central Flying School. AFC [...] "wings" [...] were worn on the left breast, while an AFC colour patch and standard rising sun badges were also worn.|$|R
