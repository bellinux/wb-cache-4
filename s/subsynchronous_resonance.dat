This analytical framework allows approaching large and complex linear time-invariant dynamic system problems (such as dynamic stability analysis, or the determination of coherent generator groups and dynamic equivalents in transient stability studies) through a reduction technique that extracts the relevant quantitative and qualitative information. This framework was later applied intensively to solve different power system stability and control problems, such as the analysis of the oscillatory stability and control, <b>subsynchronous</b> <b>resonance</b> or multi-area analysis of small signal stability.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – The {{ring-shaped}} hydrogen plasma of ASDEX Upgrade (AUG), {{an experimental}} tokamak for nuclear fu-sion research, carries an electric current up to 1. 4 MA. The generation and magnetic confinement of the plasma current requires an electric power {{of several hundred}} MVA for short time periods (up to 10 s). To keep away the pulsed load from the public utility grid, the power and energy is pro-vided by separate networks based on flywheel generators. Voltage distortions measured on the 10. 5 kV busbars were increased by resonances caused by the subtransient reac-tance of one generator and the stray capacitance of the transmission cables. The shape of the busbar voltages could be significantly improved by a simple modification of exist-ing static var compensators. The dynamic load curves of feedback controlled fusion experiments feature frequencies which {{are in the same}} range as the first eigenfrequency of the flywheel generator shaft lines (about 25 Hz).

40|$|Abstract — Turbine-generators have {{torsional}} {{natural frequencies}} due to physical properties of their long multi-element shafts. Series capacitor compensation in ac transmission networks {{has a tendency}} to reduce damping of torsional vibrations of nearby turbine generators. The phenomenon is called <b>subsynchronous</b> <b>resonance</b> (SSR), and it affects turbine-generators at subsynchronous frequencies that are specific to torsional oscillation modes of individual units. Series capacitors also have a tendency to amplify the shaft stress during major network transient events. The mechanism of the <b>subsynchronous</b> <b>resonance</b> is well understood. This paper first provides an overview of <b>subsynchronous</b> <b>resonance</b> (SSR) and the impact of series compensation on SSR, then other cases are mentioned other than series capacitor where it can also cause severe damages to machines and equipment. The paper also provides descriptions of technical methods for mitigating SSR problems.

40|$|The {{power and}} energy for ASDEX Upgrade, Germany’s largest {{experiment}} for nuclear fusion research, is provided by three separate networks based on flywheel generators. Damage at couplings of the shafts of the flywheel generators EZ 3 (144 MVA / 500 MWs) and EZ 4 (220 MVA / 600 MWs) were discovered during a routine check. They can only be explained by <b>subsynchronous</b> <b>resonances</b> (SSR) which are excited by active power transients from the converter loads. Torque sensors were installed for generator protection. They cause an early termination of plasma experiments if a predefined torque level is exceeded. Since the low natural damping involved with torsional resonances {{was identified as a}} major cause of the SSR phenomena observed, two feedback controlled DC circuits were developed providing electromagnetic damping for the generator shafts in case of SSR excitation. Since April 2003, the damping circuits have been routinely operated during all plasma experiments. They provide sufficient active damping power to avoid a trip signal from the torque sensors.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to investigate the risk for instabilities due to <b>SubSynchronous</b> <b>Resonances</b> (SSR) conditions in large wind farms connected to series-compensated transmission lines. In particular, {{the focus is on}} Doubly-Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) based wind farms. Analytical models of the system under investigation are derived {{in order to understand the}} root causes that can lead to instabilities. A frequency dependent approach, based on the Nyquist criterion, has been applied in order to investigate the risk for SSR in DFIG based wind turbines. Through this approach, it is shown that the observed phenomenon is mainly due to an energy exchange between the power converter of the turbine and the series compensated grid. This phenomenon, here referred to as SubSynchronous Controller Interaction (SSCI), is driven by the control system of the turbine, which presents a non-passive behavior in the subsynchronous frequency range. The different factors that impact the frequency characteristic of the wind turbine, thereby making the system prone to SSCI interaction, have been investigated. Through this analysis, it is shown that in a DFIG wind turbine, the current controller in the rotor-side converter plays a major role and that the risk for SSR increases when increasing its closed-loop bandwidth. In addition, it is shown that the output power generated from the wind turbine has an impact on the frequency characteristic of the turbine. Time-domain studies are performed on an aggregated wind turbine model connected to a series compensated transmission line with the {{objective of}} verifying the analytical results obtained through frequency-domain analysis.

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} linearized {{dynamics}} of the threedimensional flow in finite-length helical inducers with attached blade cavitation, {{with the purpose of}} understanding the impact of the cavitation response on the rotordynamic forces exerted by the fluid on the impeller of whirling turbopumps. The flow in the inducer annulus is modelled as a fully-guided, incompressible and inviscid liquid. Cavitation is included through the boundary conditions on the suction sides of the blades, where it is assumed to occur uniformly in a small layer of given thickness and complex acoustic admittance depending on the void fraction of the vapor phase and the parametric value of the phase-shift damping used to account for the energy dissipation in the {{dynamics of the}} cavitating layer. Constant boundary conditions for the total pressure are imposed at the inlet and outlet sections of the inducer blade channels. The three-dimensional unsteady governing equations are written in rotating "body fitted" orthogonal helical coordinates, linearized for small-amplitude whirl perturbations of the mean steady flow, and solved by modal decomposition. The whirl excitation and the boundary conditions generate internal flow resonances in the blade channels of the inducer, leading to a complex dependence of the lateral rotordynamic fluid forces on the whirl speed, the properties of the cavitating layer and the flow coefficient of the machine. Multiple <b>subsynchronous</b> and supersynchronous <b>resonances</b> are predicted. At higher levels of cavitation the amplitudes of the resonances decrease and their frequencies approach the rotational speed (synchronous conditions). Comparison with available experimental data indicates that the present theory correctly evaluates the observed magnitude of the rotordynamic forces as functions of the whirl frequency and their stabilizing or destabilizing effects on the whirl motion.

Cavitation is included through the boundary conditions on the suction sides of the blades, where it is assumed to occur uniformly in a small layer of given thickness and complex acoustic admittance, whose value depends on the void fraction of the vapor phase and the phase-shift damping coefficient used to account for the energy dissipation.

The unsteady governing equations are written in rotating “body fitted” orthogonal coordinates, linearized for small-amplitude whirl perturbations of the mean steady flow, and solved by modal decomposition. In helical turbopump inducers the whirl excitation and the boundary conditions generate internal flow resonances in the blade channels, leading to a complex dependence of the lateral rotordynamic fluid forces on the whirl speed, the dynamic properties of the cavitation region and the flow coefficient of the machine. Multiple <b>subsynchronous</b> and supersynchronous <b>resonances</b> are predicted. At higher levels of cavitation the amplitudes of these resonances decrease and their frequencies approach the rotational speed (synchronous conditions). On the other hand, application of the same approach indicates that no such resonances occur in whirling and cavitating centrifugal impellers and that the rotordynamic fluid forces are almost insensitive to cavitation, consistently with the available experimental evidence. Comparison with the scant data from the literature indicates that the present theory correctly captures the observed features and parametric trends of rotordynamic forces on whirling and cavitating turbopump impellers. Hence there are reasons to believe that it can usefully contribute to shed some light on the main physical phenomena involved and provide practical indications on their dependence on the relevant flow conditions and parameters...|$|R
