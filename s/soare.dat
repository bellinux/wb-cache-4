5|$|Cliché (Hush Hush) is the reissue of Romanian {{recording}} artist Alexandra Stan's debut studio album, Saxobeats (2011). It was released for digital download on 2 October 2013 through Maan Studio; its deluxe edition was {{made available for}} digital and physical consumption on 23 October 2013 by Victor Entertainment. The record premiered following an alleged physical altercation with her former manager Marcel Prodan, which resulted in Stan {{taking a break from}} her career. Along with Andrei Nemirschi and Marcian Alin <b>Soare,</b> Prodan has written and produced nearly all the songs on Cliché (Hush Hush).|$|E

40|$|The harvestmen {{subfamily}} Hernandariinae is {{reviewed and}} a new classification is proposed based on cladistic analysis using 67 morphological characters. The subfamily is composed of six genera and 23 species and occurs in south-southeastern Brazil, Paraguay, and northeastern Argentina. Fourteen new combinations are proposed: Hernandaria armatifrons (Roewer, 1917); H. una (Mello-Leitão, 1927); Acrogonyleptes granulatus (H. <b>Soares,</b> 1966); A. pectinifemur (<b>Soares</b> & <b>Soares,</b> 1947); Acanthogonyleptes alticola (Mello-Leitão, 1922); A. editus (Roewer, 1943); A. fallax (Mello-Leitão, 1932); A. fulvigranulatus (Mello-Leitão, 1922); A. marmoratus (Mello-Leitão, 1940); A. pictus (Piza, 1942); A. singularis (Mello-Leitão, 1935); A. soaresi (Mello-Leitão, 1944); A. variolosus (Mello-Leitão, 1944). Seven synonymies are proposed: Proweyhia Mello-Leitão, 1927 and Metaxundarava Mello-Leitão, 1927 = Hernandaria Sørensen, 1884; Apembolephaenus calcaratus <b>Soares</b> & <b>Soares,</b> 1945 = H. armatifrons (Roewer, 1917); Sphaerobunus Rower, 1917 and Paraproweyhia <b>Soares</b> & <b>Soares,</b> 1947 = Acrogonyleptes Roewer, 1917; Paraproweyhia curitibae <b>Soares</b> & <b>Soares,</b> 1947 = Acrogonyleptes exochus (Mello-Leitão, 1931); and Melloleitaniana curitibae B. <b>Soares,</b> 1943 = Acrogonyleptes spinifrons Roewer, 1917. Three species are revalidated: Acrogonyleptes granulatus (H. <b>Soares,</b> 1966), A. pectinifemur (<b>Soares</b> & <b>Soares,</b> 1947), and A. spinifrons Roewer, 1917. Seven new species are described: Hernandaria sundermannorum sp. nov. (São Paulo State, Brazil), Hernandaria anitagaribaldiae sp. nov. (Santa Catarina State, Brazil), Hernandaria zumbii sp. nov. (Santa Catarina State, Brazil), Hernandaria chicomendesi sp. nov. (Santa Catarina State, Brazil), Acrogonyleptes cheguevarai sp. nov. (Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil), Pseudotrogulus pagu sp. nov.

In 2000, <b>Soares</b> took his show's format (very similar to David Letterman's) back to Rede Globo, {{where it was}} then called Programa do Jô, and hosted the program until 2016.|$|R
25|$|Also in 1922, Fondane and Pascal {{set up the}} {{theatrical}} troupe Insula ("The Island"), which stated its commitment to avant-garde theater. Probably named after Minulescu's earlier Symbolist magazine, the group was likely a local replica of Jean Copeau's nonconformist productions in France. Hosted by the Maison d'Art galleries in Bucharest, the company was joined by, among others, actresses Lina Fundoianu-Pascal and Victoria Mierlescu, and director Sandu Eliad. Other participants were writers (Cocea, Pană, Zissu, Scarlat Callimachi, Mărgărita Miller Verghy, Ion Pillat) and theatrical people (George Ciprian, Marietta Sadova, <b>Soare</b> Z. <b>Soare,</b> Dida Solomon, Alice Sturdza, Ionel Țăranu).|$|E

25|$|Although the PCR did not resurrect Amicii URSS in its illegal structure, it {{attempted}} to prolong its influence {{by creating a}} succession of organizations, all of which replicated its goals; the first of these, known as Societatea pentru întreținerea raporturilor culturale dintre România și Uniunea Sovietică (the Society for Maintaining Cultural Links between Romania and the Soviet Union), was created on May 22, 1935, and notably drew support from the musician George Enescu and linguist Alexandru Rosetti. Alongside these and various former members of Amicii URSS, signers of its founding document included, among others, the lawyer Radu R. Rosetti, the academics Eugen Heroveanu and Traian Săvulescu, the visual artists Nicolae Tonitza and Jean Nițescu, the writers Victor Eftimiu and Radu Boureanu, the composers Matei Socor and Constantin Silvestri, the operatic artists Ionel Perlea and Jean Athanasiu, the architect Octav Doicescu, the theater director <b>Soare</b> Z. <b>Soare,</b> the actors Tony Bulandra, Gheorghe Timică and Ion Iancovescu, {{as well as the}} musical critics Emanoil Ciomac and Traian Șelmaru. The new organization was based in Bucharest, on Dr. Victor Poloni Street.|$|E
40|$|Longiperna Roewer, 1929 is {{revised and}} new records of {{distribution}} are presented for the Brazilian Costal Atlantic Rain Forest (from Rio de Janeiro to Santa Catarina states). The following new synonymies are established: Longiperna concolor (Mello-Leitão, 1923) = L. zonata Mello-Leitão, 1935 and L. heliaca B. <b>Soares,</b> 1942; Longiperna coxalis (Roewer, 1943) = L. areolata B. <b>Soares,</b> 1944; Longiperna insperata (<b>Soares</b> & <b>Soares,</b> 1947) = L. paranensis <b>Soares</b> & <b>Soares,</b> 1947 and L. curitibana Kury, 2003.

25|$|Caragiale contrasted {{the other}} major writers of his generation, {{including}} his friends Mihai Eminescu, Ioan Slavici, Barbu Ştefănescu Delavrancea, and Sămănătorul journal founder Alexandru Vlahuţă, {{all of whom were}} advocating a return to the rural sphere and peasant traditionalism. In Moftul Român, he parodied the archaisms favored by Ştefănescu Delavrancea; during his final years, he also questioned the aesthetic value of Ştefănescu Delavrancea's medieval-themed play Apus de <b>soare.</b> Prominent nationalists and traditionalists tended to be reserved in their assessment of Caragiale's literary contributions—they include his friend Eminescu and historian Nicolae Iorga.|$|E
25|$|Published a {{generation}} later, the play Apus de <b>soare,</b> by Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea, also has Arbore for a main protagonist. In Delavrancea's subsequent work, Viforul, Arbore is again the central figure—although, according to critic Eugen Lovinescu, his presence is superfluous, epic rather than dramatic. Arbore's alleged scheme is {{taken for granted}} by the dramatist, and depicted as a grave error of judgement. The hunting trip episode is depicted as an early stage in {{the conflict between the}} prince and the gatekeeper, leading to the deliberate murder of Arbore junior, here named Cătălin.|$|E
25|$|Macedonski's {{eldest son}} Alexis {{continued}} {{to pursue a}} career as a painter. His son <b>Soare</b> followed in his footsteps, receiving acclaim from art critics of the period. Soare's short career ended in 1928, before he turned nineteen, but his works have been featured in several retrospective exhibitions, including one organized by Alexis. Alexis later experimented with scenic design as an assistant to French filmmaker René Clair; his later life, shrouded in mystery and intrigue, led him to a career in Fascist Italy and Francoist Spain. Another of Alexandru Macedonski's sons, Nikita, was also a poet and painter. For a while in the 1920s, he edited the literary supplement of Universul newspaper. Two years after her father's death, Anna Macedonski married poet Mihail Celarianu.|$|E

25|$|Another {{important}} question is the existence of automorphisms in recursion-theoretic structures. One of these structures {{is that one of}} recursively enumerable sets under inclusion modulo finite difference; in this structure, A is below B if and only if the set difference B'A is finite. Maximal sets (as defined in the previous paragraph) have the property that they cannot be automorphic to non-maximal sets, that is, if there is an automorphism of the recursive enumerable sets under the structure just mentioned, then every maximal set is mapped to another maximal set. <b>Soare</b> (1974) showed that also the converse holds, that is, every two maximal sets are automorphic. So the maximal sets form an orbit, that is, every automorphism preserves maximality and any two maximal sets are transformed into each other by some automorphism. Harrington gave a further example of an automorphic property: that of the creative sets, the sets which are many-one equivalent to the halting problem.|$|E
25|$|When Post {{defined the}} notion of a simple set as an r.e. set with an {{infinite}} complement not containing any infinite r.e. set, he started to study the structure of the recursively enumerable sets under inclusion. This lattice became a well-studied structure. Recursive sets can be defined in this structure by the basic result that a set is recursive if and only if the set and its complement are both recursively enumerable. Infinite r.e. sets have always infinite recursive subsets; but on the other hand, simple sets exist but do not have a coinfinite recursive superset. Post (1944) introduced already hypersimple and hyperhypersimple sets; later maximal sets were constructed which are r.e. sets such that every r.e. superset is either a finite variant of the given maximal set or is co-finite. Post's original motivation in the study of this lattice was to find a structural notion such that every set which satisfies this property is neither in the Turing degree of the recursive sets nor in the Turing degree of the halting problem. Post did not find such a property and the solution to his problem applied priority methods instead; Harrington and <b>Soare</b> (1991) found eventually such a property.|$|E

Anna Comnena relates how local Vlachs showed [...] "the way through the passes" [...] of the Balkan Mountains to invading Cumans in 1094. All the same, Vlachs served in the imperial army, for instance during an imperial campaign against the Kingdom of Hungary in 1166.
