5|$|Aspirin {{is readily}} broken {{down in the}} body to <b>salicylic</b> acid, which itself has anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and {{analgesic}} effects. In 2012, <b>salicylic</b> acid was found to activate AMP-activated protein kinase, which has been suggested as a possible explanation {{for some of the}} effects of both <b>salicylic</b> acid and aspirin. The acetyl portion of the aspirin molecule has its own targets. Acetylation of cellular proteins is a well-established phenomenon in the regulation of protein function at the post-translational level. Aspirin is able to acetylate several other targets in addition to COX isoenzymes. These acetylation reactions may explain many hitherto unexplained effects of aspirin.|$|E
5|$|<b>Salicylic</b> acid is a topically applied beta-hydroxy acid {{that stops}} {{bacteria}} from reproducing and has keratolytic properties. It opens obstructed skin pores and promotes shedding of epithelial skin cells. <b>Salicylic</b> acid {{is known to}} be less effective than retinoid therapy. Dry skin is the most commonly seen side effect with topical application, though darkening of the skin has been observed in individuals with darker skin types.|$|E
5|$|The {{synthesis}} of aspirin {{is classified as}} an esterification reaction. <b>Salicylic</b> acid is treated with acetic anhydride, an acid derivative, causing a chemical reaction that turns <b>salicylic</b> acid's hydroxyl group into an ester group (R-OH → R-OCOCH3). This process yields aspirin and acetic acid, which is considered a byproduct of this reaction. Small amounts of sulfuric acid (and occasionally phosphoric acid) are almost always used as a catalyst. This method is commonly employed in undergraduate teaching labs.|$|E
5|$|As much as 80% of {{therapeutic}} doses of <b>salicylic</b> acid is metabolized in the liver. Conjugation with glycine forms salicyluric acid, and with glucuronic acid to form two different glucuronide esters. The conjugate with the acetyl group intact {{is referred to}} as the acyl glucuronide; the deacetylated conjugate is the phenolic glucuronide. These metabolic pathways have only a limited capacity. Small amounts of <b>salicylic</b> acid are also hydroxylated to gentisic acid. With large salicylate doses, the kinetics switch from first-order to zero-order, as metabolic pathways become saturated and renal excretion becomes increasingly important.|$|E
5|$|Formulations {{containing}} {{high concentrations}} of aspirin often smell like vinegar because aspirin can decompose through hydrolysis in moist conditions, yielding <b>salicylic</b> and acetic acids.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, Hoffmann {{started working}} {{to find a}} less irritating {{substitute}} for <b>salicylic</b> acid. It is generally accepted that he turned to this idea because his father was suffering {{the side effects of}} taking sodium salicylate for rheumatism.|$|E
5|$|Salicylates are {{excreted}} {{mainly by}} the kidneys as salicyluric acid (75%), free <b>salicylic</b> acid (10%), <b>salicylic</b> phenol (10%), and acyl glucuronides (5%), gentisic acid (< 1%), and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid. When small doses (less than 250 mg in an adult) are ingested, all pathways proceed by first-order kinetics, with an elimination half-life of about 2.0 h to 4.5 h. When higher doses of salicylate are ingested (more than 4 g), the half-life becomes much longer (15 h to 30 h), because the biotransformation pathways {{concerned with the}} formation of salicyluric acid and salicyl phenolic glucuronide become saturated. Renal excretion of <b>salicylic</b> acid becomes increasingly important as the metabolic pathways become saturated, because it is extremely sensitive to changes in urinary pH. A 10- to 20-fold increase in renal clearance occurs when urine pH is increased from 5 to 8. The use of urinary alkalinization exploits this particular aspect of salicylate elimination.|$|E
5|$|There {{is also a}} three-step {{program in}} Extra Strength, with a 7 percent {{concentration}} of benzoyl peroxide, and a Gentle Formula that instead contains a 2 percent concentration of <b>salicylic</b> acid, an exfoliant. The three-step kit in Europe is based on <b>salicylic</b> acid; in the UK it costs £39.99 ($60) for a two-month supply. Other Proactiv products include an oil-free moisturizer that uses octinoxate (7.5 percent) and zinc oxide (3 percent), and an anti-dandruff shampoo with a one percent concentration of zinc pyrithione.|$|E
5|$|This {{reaction}} is exploited in the Trinder spot test, {{which is used}} to indicate the presence of salicylates, particularly <b>salicylic</b> acid, which contains a phenolic OH group.|$|E
5|$|Although the United States {{remained}} officially neutral until April 1917, it {{was increasingly}} throwing its {{support to the}} Allies through trade. To counter this, German ambassador Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff and Interior Ministry official Heinrich Albert were tasked with undermining American industry and maintaining public support for Germany. One of their agents was a former Bayer employee, Hugo Schweitzer. Schweitzer set up a contract for a front company called the Chemical Exchange Association to buy all of Edison's excess phenol. Much of the phenol {{would go to the}} German-owned Chemische Fabrik von Heyden's American subsidiary; Heyden was the supplier of Bayer's <b>salicylic</b> acid for aspirin manufacture. By July 1915, Edison's plants were selling about three tons of phenol per day to Schweitzer; Heyden's <b>salicylic</b> acid production was soon back on line, and in turn Bayer's aspirin plant was running as well.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{decomposes}} {{rapidly in}} solutions of ammonium acetate or the acetates, carbonates, citrates, or hydroxides of the alkali metals. It is stable in dry air, but gradually hydrolyses {{in contact with}} moisture to acetic and <b>salicylic</b> acids. In solution with alkalis, the hydrolysis proceeds rapidly and the clear solutions formed may consist entirely of acetate and salicylate.|$|E
5|$|Guthy-Renker {{introduced}} Proactiv+ in 2013, charging $30 in the United States for a month's supply if {{the customer}} creates a subscription. It is a paraben-free three-step kit comprising a cleanser and toning gel, each with 2.5 percent benzoyl peroxide, and a moisturizer with <b>salicylic</b> acid. It is reportedly more hydrating {{than the original}} program.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, as {{the young}} {{discipline}} of organic chemistry began to grow in Europe, scientists attempted to isolate and purify the active components of many medicines, including willow bark. After unsuccessful attempts by Italian chemists Brugnatelli and Fontana in 1826, Joseph Buchner obtained relatively pure salicin crystals in 1828; the following year, Henri Leroux developed another procedure for extracting modest yields of salicin. In 1834, Swiss pharmacist Johann Pagenstecher discovered {{what he thought was}} a new pain-reducing substance, isolated from the common remedy of meadowsweet (Spiraea ulmaria). By 1838, Italian chemist Raffaele Piria found a method of obtaining a more potent acid form of willow extract, which he named <b>salicylic</b> acid. The German chemist who had been working to identify the Spiraea extract, Karl Jacob Löwig, soon realized that it was in fact the same <b>salicylic</b> acid that Piria had found.|$|E
5|$|It {{is likely}} that Hoffmann did as most chemists have always done, {{starting}} by studying the literature and recreating the published methods. On 10 August 1897 (according to his laboratory notebooks), Hoffmann found a better method for making ASA, from <b>salicylic</b> acid refluxed with acetic anhydride.|$|E
5|$|Salicylate medicines—including salicin, <b>salicylic</b> acid, {{and sodium}} salicylate— were {{difficult}} and wasteful to extract from plants, and in 1860 Hermann Kolbe {{worked out a}} way to synthesize <b>salicylic</b> acid. Throughout the late 1800s use of salicylates grew considerably, and physicians increasingly knew what to expect from these medicines: reduction of pain, fever, and inflammation. However, the unpleasant side effects, particularly gastric irritation, limited their usefulness, as did their intense bitterness. By the 1880s, the German chemical industry, jump-started by the lucrative development of dyes from coal tar, was branching out to investigate the potential of new tar-derived medicines. The turning point was the advent of Kalle & Company's Antifebrine, the branded version of the well-known dye derivative acetanilide—the fever-reducing properties of which were discovered by accident in 1886. Antifebrine's success inspired Carl Duisberg, the head of research at the small dye firm Friedrich Bayer & Company, to start a systematic search for other chemical fever-reducers. Bayer chemists soon developed Phenacetin, followed by the sedatives Sulfonal and Trional.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} aspirin (also known as acetylsalicylic acid or ASA) {{and the medical}} use of it and related {{substances}} stretches back to antiquity, though pure ASA has only been manufactured and marketed since 1899. Medicines made from willow and other salicylate-rich plants appear in clay tablets from ancient Sumer {{as well as the}} Ebers Papyrus from ancient Egypt. Hippocrates referred to their use of <b>salicylic</b> tea to reduce fevers around 400 BC, and were part of the pharmacopoeia of Western medicine in classical antiquity and the Middle Ages. Willow bark extract became recognized for its specific effects on fever, pain and inflammation in the mid-eighteenth century. By the nineteenth century pharmacists were experimenting with and prescribing a variety of chemicals related to <b>salicylic</b> acid, the active component of willow extract.|$|E
5|$|Eichengrün sent ASA to Dreser's {{pharmacology}} {{group for}} testing, {{and the initial}} results were very positive. The next step would normally have been clinical trials, but Dreser opposed further investigation of ASA because of <b>salicylic</b> acid's reputation for weakening the heart—possibly {{a side effect of}} the high doses often used to treat rheumatism. Dreser's group was soon busy testing Felix Hoffmann's next chemical success: diacetylmorphine (which the Bayer team soon branded as heroin because of the heroic feeling it gave them). Eichengrün, frustrated by Dreser's rejection of ASA, went directly to Bayer's Berlin representative Felix Goldmann to arrange low-profile trials with doctors. Though the results of those trials were also very positive, with no reports of the typical <b>salicylic</b> acid complications, Dreser still demurred. However, Carl Duisberg intervened and scheduled full testing. Soon, Dreser admitted ASA's potential and Bayer decided to proceed with production. Dreser wrote a report of the findings to publicize the new drug; in it, he omitted any mention of Hoffmann or Eichengrün. He would also be {{the only one of the}} three to receive royalties for the drug (for testing it), since it was ineligible for any patent the chemists might have taken out for creating it. For many years, however, he attributed Aspirin's discovery solely to Hoffmann.|$|E
5|$|Many {{different}} treatments {{exist for}} acne. These include alpha hydroxy acid, anti-androgen medications, antibiotics, antiseborrheic medications, azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide, hormonal treatments, keratolytic soaps, nicotinamide, retinoids, and <b>salicylic</b> acid. They {{are believed to}} work in at least four different ways, including the following: reducing inflammation, hormonal manipulation, killing P. acnes, and normalizing skin cell shedding and sebum production in the pore to prevent blockage. Common treatments include topical therapies such as antibiotics, benzoyl peroxide, and retinoids, and systemic therapies including antibiotics, hormonal agents, and oral retinoids.|$|E
5|$|Many {{medicinal}} plants produce chemical compounds which {{give them an}} evolutionary advantage, such as defending against herbivores or, like <b>salicylic</b> acid, acting against other plants. These are often useful as drugs, and the content and known pharmacological activity of these substances in {{medicinal plants}} is the scientific basis for their use in modern medicine, and in the cases where medicinal plants have been analysed, also of some traditional medicines. The major classes of pharmacologically active phytochemicals are described below, with examples of medicinal plants that contain them.|$|E
5|$|Plants have {{elaborate}} and effective defence mechanisms against viruses. One {{of the most}} effective is the presence of so-called resistance (R) genes. Each R gene confers resistance to a particular virus by triggering localised areas of cell death around the infected cell, which can often be seen with the unaided eye as large spots. This stops the infection from spreading. RNA interference is also an effective defence in plants. When they are infected, plants often produce natural disinfectants that kill viruses, such as <b>salicylic</b> acid, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen molecules.|$|E
5|$|Polymorphism, or {{the ability}} of a {{substance}} to form more than one crystal structure, is important in the development of pharmaceutical ingredients. Many drugs are receiving regulatory approval for only a single crystal form or polymorph. For a long time, only one crystal structure for aspirin was known. That aspirin might have a second crystalline form was suspected since the 1960s. The elusive second polymorph was first discovered by Vishweshwar and coworkers in 2005, and fine structural details were given by Bond et al. A new crystal type was found after attempted cocrystallization of aspirin and levetiracetam from hot acetonitrile. The form II is only stable at 100K and reverts to form I at ambient temperature. In the (unambiguous) form I, two <b>salicylic</b> molecules form centrosymmetric dimers through the acetyl groups with the (acidic) methyl proton to carbonyl hydrogen bonds, and in the newly claimed form II, each <b>salicylic</b> molecule forms the same hydrogen bonds with two neighboring molecules instead of one. With respect to the hydrogen bonds formed by the carboxylic acid groups, both polymorphs form identical dimer structures.|$|E
5|$|The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{warned in}} 2014 that {{over-the-counter}} acne products containing benzoyl peroxide and/or <b>salicylic</b> acid, including Proactiv, can cause severe irritation, {{as well as}} rare but life-threatening allergic reactions. Consumers were advised to stop using the products if they experience hives or itching, and to seek emergency medical attention if they feel faint, or experience throat tightness, breathing problems, or swelling of the eyes, face, lips or tongue. The FDA noted that it remains unclear whether the reactions are caused by the active ingredients, inactive ingredients or a combination.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the late}} stages of {{pregnancy}} {{are associated with}} an increase in sebaceous gland activity in the skin, pregnancy has not been reliably associated with worsened acne severity. In general, topically applied medications are considered the first-line approach to acne treatment during pregnancy, as they have little systemic absorption and are therefore unlikely to harm a developing fetus. Highly recommended therapies include topically applied benzoyl peroxide (category C) and azelaic acid (category B). <b>Salicylic</b> acid carries a category C safety rating due to higher systemic absorption (9–25%), and an association between the use of anti-inflammatory medications in the third trimester and adverse effects to the developing fetus including too little amniotic fluid in the uterus and early closure of the babies' ductus arteriosus blood vessel. Prolonged use of <b>salicylic</b> acid over significant areas of the skin or under occlusive dressings is not recommended as these methods increase systemic absorption and the potential for fetal harm. Tretinoin (category C) and adapalene (category C) are very poorly absorbed, but certain studies have suggested teratogenic effects in the first trimester. Due to persistent safety concerns, topical retinoids are not recommended for use during pregnancy. In studies examining the effects of topical retinoids during pregnancy, fetal harm has not been seen {{in the second and third}} trimesters. Retinoids contraindicated for use during pregnancy include the topical retinoid tazarotene, and oral retinoids isotretinoin and acitretin (all category X). Spironolactone is relatively contraindicated for use during pregnancy due to its antiandrogen effects. Finasteride is not recommended as it is highly teratogenic.|$|E
5|$|Chemical peels {{can be used}} {{to reduce}} the {{appearance}} of acne scars. Mild peels include those using glycolic acid, lactic acid, <b>salicylic</b> acid, Jessner's solution, or a lower concentrations (20%) of trichloroacetic acid. These peels only affect the epidermal layer of the skin and can be useful in the treatment of superficial acne scars as well as skin pigmentation changes from inflammatory acne. Higher concentrations of trichloroacetic acid (30–40%) are considered to be medium-strength peels and affect skin as deep as the papillary dermis. Formulations of trichloroacetic acid concentrated to 50% or more are considered to be deep chemical peels. Medium-strength and deep-strength chemical peels are more effective for deeper atrophic scars, but are more likely to cause side effects such as skin pigmentation changes, infection, and small white superficial cysts known as milia.|$|E
5|$|Complementary therapies {{have been}} {{investigated}} for treating people with acne. Low-quality evidence suggests topical application of tea tree oil or bee venom may reduce {{the total number of}} skin lesions in those with acne. Tea tree oil is thought to be approximately as effective as benzoyl peroxide or <b>salicylic</b> acid, but has been associated with allergic contact dermatitis. Proposed mechanisms for tea tree oil's anti-acne effects include antibacterial action against P. acnes, and anti-inflammatory properties. Numerous other plant-derived therapies have been observed to have positive effects against acne (e.g., basil oil and oligosaccharides from seaweed); however, few studies have been performed, and most have been of lower methodological quality. There is a lack of high-quality evidence for the use of acupuncture, herbal medicine, or cupping therapy for acne.|$|E
5|$|Many {{treatment}} options for acne are available, including lifestyle changes, medications, and medical procedures. Eating fewer simple carbohydrates such as sugar may help. Treatments applied {{directly to the}} affected skin, such as azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and <b>salicylic</b> acid, are commonly used. Antibiotics and retinoids are available in formulations that are applied to the skin and taken by mouth {{for the treatment of}} acne. However, resistance to antibiotics may develop as a result of antibiotic therapy. Several types of birth control pills help against acne in women. Isotretinoin pills are usually reserved for severe acne due to greater potential side effects. Early and aggressive treatment of acne is advocated by some in the medical community to decrease the overall long-term impact to individuals.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{has been}} shown to have at least three {{additional}} modes of action. It uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in cartilaginous (and hepatic) mitochondria, by diffusing from the inner membrane space as a proton carrier back into the mitochondrial matrix, where it ionizes once again to release protons. Aspirin buffers and transports the protons. When high doses are given, it may actually cause fever, owing to the heat released from the electron transport chain, as opposed to the antipyretic action of aspirin seen with lower doses. In addition, aspirin induces the formation of NO-radicals in the body, which have been shown in mice to have an independent mechanism of reducing inflammation. This reduced leukocyte adhesion is an important step in the immune response to infection; however, evidence is insufficient to show aspirin helps to fight infection. More recent data also suggest <b>salicylic</b> acid and its derivatives modulate signaling through NF-κB. NF-κB, a transcription factor complex, plays a central role in many biological processes, including inflammation.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with growing}} {{legal and illegal}} {{competition}} for the globally marketed ASA, Bayer worked to cement the connection between Bayer and Aspirin. One strategy it developed was to switch from distributing Aspirin powder for pharmacists to press into pill form to distributing standardized tablets—complete with the distinctive Bayer cross logo. In 1903 the company set up an American subsidiary, with a converted factory in Rensselaer, New York, to produce Aspirin for the American market without paying import duties. Bayer also sued the most egregious patent violators and smugglers. The company's attempts to hold onto its Aspirin sales incited criticism from muckraking journalists and the American Medical Association, especially after the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act that prevented trademarked drugs from being listed in the United States Pharmacopeia; Bayer listed ASA with an intentionally convoluted generic name (monoacetic acid ester of <b>salicylic</b> acid) to discourage doctors referring to anything but Aspirin.|$|E
5|$|The {{place of}} plants in {{medicine}} was radically altered in the 19th century by {{the application of}} chemical analysis. Alkaloids were isolated from a succession of medicinal plants, starting with morphine from the poppy in 1806, and soon followed by ipecacuanha and strychnos in 1817, quinine from the cinchona tree, and then many others. As chemistry progressed, additional classes of pharmacologically active substances were discovered in medicinal plants. Commercial extraction of purified alkaloids including morphine from medicinal plants began at Merck in 1826. Synthesis of a substance first discovered in a medicinal plant began with <b>salicylic</b> acid in 1853. Around {{the end of the}} 19th century, the mood of pharmacy turned against medicinal plants, as enzymes often modified the active ingredients when whole plants were dried, and alkaloids and glycosides purified from plant material started to be preferred. Drug discovery from plants continued to be important through the 20th century and into the 21st, with important anti-cancer drugs from yew and Madagascar periwinkle.|$|E
5|$|Phytochemistry is {{a branch}} of plant {{biochemistry}} primarily concerned with the chemical substances produced by plants during secondary metabolism. Some of these compounds are toxins such as the alkaloid coniine from hemlock. Others, such as the essential oils peppermint oil and lemon oil are useful for their aroma, as flavourings and spices (e.g., capsaicin), and in medicine as pharmaceuticals as in opium from opium poppies. Many medicinal and recreational drugs, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (active ingredient in cannabis), caffeine, morphine and nicotine come directly from plants. Others are simple derivatives of botanical natural products. For example, the pain killer aspirin is the acetyl ester of <b>salicylic</b> acid, originally isolated from the bark of willow trees, and {{a wide range of}} opiate painkillers like heroin are obtained by chemical modification of morphine obtained from the opium poppy. Popular stimulants come from plants, such as caffeine from coffee, tea and chocolate, and nicotine from tobacco. Most alcoholic beverages come from fermentation of carbohydrate-rich plant products such as barley (beer), rice (sake) and grapes (wine). Native Americans have used various plants as ways of treating illness or disease for thousands of years. This knowledge Native Americans have on plants has been recorded by enthnobotanists and then in turn has been used by pharmaceutical companies as a way of drug discovery.|$|E
25|$|No studies examine topical <b>salicylic</b> acid in pregnancy. Oral <b>salicylic</b> acid is not {{associated}} {{with an increase in}} malformations if used during the first trimester, but in late pregnancy has been associated with bleeding, especially intracranial bleeding. The risks of aspirin late in pregnancy are probably not relevant for a topical exposure to <b>salicylic</b> acid, even late in the pregnancy, because of its low systemic levels. Topical <b>salicylic</b> acid is common in many over-the-counter dermatological agents and the lack of adverse reports suggests a low teratogenic potential.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{treatments}} {{have been found}} to be effective. A 2012 review of different treatments for skin warts in otherwise healthy people concluded modest benefit from <b>salicylic</b> acid and cryotherapy appears similar to <b>salicylic</b> acid.|$|E
25|$|<b>Salicylic</b> acid has {{the formula}} C6H4(OH)COOH, where the OH group is ortho to the {{carboxyl}} group. It {{is also known}} as 2-hydroxybenzoic acid. It is poorly soluble in water (2 g/L at 20°C). Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid or ASA) can be prepared by the esterification of the phenolic hydroxyl group of <b>salicylic</b> acid with the acetyl group from acetic anhydride or acetyl chloride. <b>Salicylic</b> acid can also be prepared using the Kolbe-Schmitt reaction.|$|E
25|$|<b>Salicylic</b> acid {{activates}} adenosine monophosphate-activated {{protein kinase}} (AMPK) and this action {{may play a}} role in the anticancer effects of the compound and its prodrugs aspirin and salsalate. The antidiabetic effects of <b>salicylic</b> acid are likely mediated by AMPK activation primarily through allosteric conformational change that increases levels of phosphorylation.|$|E
25|$|When ingested, <b>salicylic</b> acid has a {{possible}} ototoxic effect by inhibiting prestin. It can induce transient hearing loss in zinc-deficient rats. An injection of <b>salicylic</b> acid induced hearing loss, while an injection of zinc reversed the hearing loss. An injection of magnesium in the zinc-deficient rats did not reverse the induced hearing loss.|$|E
25|$|Some {{people are}} hypersensitive to <b>salicylic</b> acid and related compounds.|$|E
