5|$|Brothers Robert and Dennis Skotak {{were hired}} to {{supervise}} the visual effects, having previously worked with Cameron on several Roger Corman movies. Two stages were used to construct the colony on LV-426, using miniature models that were on average six feet tall and three feet wide. Filming the miniatures was difficult because of the weather; the wind would blow over the props; however, it proved helpful to give the effect of weather on the planet. Cameron used these miniatures and several effects to make scenes look larger than they really were, including rear projection, mirrors, beam splitters, camera splits and foreground miniatures. Due to budget limits, Cameron <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pay for the robotic arm used to cut into Ripley's shuttle in the opening scene. Practical effects supervisor John Richardson (who won a special effects Oscar {{for his part in}} the film) declared his biggest challenge was creating the forklift power loader exoskeletons, which required only three months of work and had Cameron complaining about visual details during construction. The model could not stand on its own, requiring either wires dangling from the shoulders or a pole through the back attached to a crane. While Sigourney Weaver was inside the power loader model, a stunt man standing behind it would move the arms and legs.|$|E
5|$|In February 2013 Tuscaloosa Police arrested four {{football}} {{players from the}} 2012 season: Brent Calloway, Tyler Hayes, D. J. Pettway and Eddie Williams. Williams was involved in four separate incidents on February 10 and 11. On February 10 he had a dispute with a gas station clerk about paying for gas and <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> get something {{in the trunk of}} his car. The clerk called the police, the police arrested Williams with carrying a pistol without a license, but Williams was released later that day on a $500 bond. Later that night around 12:30a.m., Williams attacked an Alabama student with Hayes and Pettway and they stole the student's backpack. In a separate incident almost an hour later, Williams attacked another student while Hayes and Pettway waited in a car. Later Williams used one of the students' credit cards. Calloway was also arrested after he used a victim's student debit card with knowledge it was stolen. Following the arrests, Alabama suspended all four from the football team. Alabama also prohibited Hayes, Pettway and Williams from entering campus. On February 27, Alabama dismissed all four players from the university after completing a judicial review.|$|E

25|$|On 3 June Foch {{informed}} Haig {{that he and}} Pershing {{had agreed}} that the US Divisions would move to the French sector. Foch moved French forces down from Flanders. Haig complied with Foch’s request to deploy a corps of 3 divisions to the Somme sector, but sent a formal protest to the British Government (4 June) at any further movement of reserves out of the BEF sector. At a major Allied conference at Beauvais (7 June) Lord Milner agreed with Clemenceau that Foch should {{have the power to}} order all Allied troops as he saw fit, over the protests of Haig who argued that it would reduce his power to safeguard the interests of the British Army. It was agreed that Haig and Foch should meet more frequently, and in time they developed a good working relationship (although wags at GHQ <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> fight “Boche, Foch and Loygeorges”).|$|E

500|$|One of Aden's {{most notable}} storylines {{highlighted}} {{the issue of}} sexual abuse. In the story Aden struggles {{to cope with the}} sexual abuse inflicted on him by his grandfather. Lasance and the serial's writing team worked hard to raise awareness of the [...] "taboo issue". Lasance said he felt he had to do the storyline [...] "one hundred percent justice" [...] because there are people, [...] "more than we probably realise" [...] in real life who have suffered the same as Aden. He felt it was a challenge to play as he did not want victims to think it was unrealistic. Lasance <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> come onto set each morning in Aden's frame of mind. To research Aden's storyline, he spoke to a relative who had been through a similar situation. He drew inspiration for his portrayal from how his relative had coped and the effects it had on him growing up. Lasance said like his relative, Aden goes though [...] "the huge rebellion years" [...] and the subsequent attempts to [...] "reconnect with those people who had betrayed you." [...] Lasance also received extra training from an acting coach, where he used [...] "haunting" [...] techniques to make himself feel vulnerable like Aden. He also used the storyline to show US agents his acting abilities.|$|E
500|$|Second-term U.S Representative Joe Sestak, {{a former}} U.S. Navy admiral, began privately {{discussing}} {{the possibility of}} seeking the Democratic nomination {{with his family in}} December 2008. Senator Bob Menendez, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, approached Sestak in April 2009 and asked him to run, but Sestak claimed he was not initially interested. Nevertheless, media speculation about Sestak's possible campaign began as early as mid-April 2009, and intensified the day [...] Specter changed political parties. While most Democrats embraced the long-time Senator, Sestak issued a statement criticizing Specter's decision, declaring it an opportunist move that should have been made in consultation with Pennsylvanians rather than the Senate Democratic leadership and the Washington political establishment. Menendez approached Sestak again, this time asking him not to run against Specter, but Sestak did not agree to back down. Later, when asked by Fox News, Sestak insisted he had not decided whether he would run for the office, but declined to immediately endorse Specter and <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> [...] "wait and see". During a May 3 appearance on CNN's State of the Union with John King, Sestak questioned whether Specter was really a genuine Democrat, adding, [...] "I think Arlen has to tell us not that it was too hard to run against someone. ... What I need to know is, what is he running for?" ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the script}} {{that was sent}} to {{prospective}} actors and directors, Lester and Angela had sex; {{by the time of}} shooting, Ball had rewritten the scene to the final version. Ball initially rebuffed counsel from others that he change the script, feeling they were being puritanical; the final impetus to alter the scene came from DreamWorks' then-president Walter Parkes. He convinced Ball by indicating that in Greek mythology, the hero [...] "has a moment of epiphany before tragedy occurs". Ball later said his anger when writing the first draft had blinded him to the idea that Lester needed to refuse sex with Angela to complete his emotional journey—to achieve redemption. Jinks and Cohen asked Ball not to alter the scene right away, as they felt it would be inappropriate to make changes to the script before a director had been hired. Early drafts also included a flashback to Col. Fitts' service in the Marines, a sequence that unequivocally established his homosexual leanings. In love with another Marine, Col. Fitts sees the man die and comes to believe that he is being punished for the [...] "sin" [...] of being gay. Ball removed the sequence because it did not fit the structure {{of the rest of the}} film—Col. Fitts was the only character to have a flashback—and because it removed the element of surprise from Col. Fitts' later pass at Lester. Ball <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> write it for his own benefit to know what happened to Col. Fitts, though all that remained in later drafts was subtext.|$|E
500|$|A Billboard {{magazine}} review said Phantasmagoria [...] "lives up to {{the advanced}} billing" [...] and [...] "aims to unnerve and succeeds gruesomely with bloody special effects interspliced in trusty scare-flick fashion with daubs of flesh and hints of sex". USA Today writer Joe Wilson gave it three-and-a-half stars and called it well-produced, visually appealing, frighteningly realistic and [...] "a much-needed change from normal fare", although he said the plot did not start to become interesting until halfway through. Gene Emery of The Providence Journal said the game was [...] "an impressive work, a sophisticated mix of live action and a rich computer-generated environment, coupled with a musical score that's spooky without being overwhelming". He also called the gameplay [...] "elegant in its simplicity". San Francisco Chronicle writer Laura Evenson called it unpredictable and addictive, comparing it to a good mystery novel. A reviewer for Next Generation {{was pleased with the}} story, the production values of the cutscenes, and the way the game mixed in full motion video without resulting in slowdown or poor control. However, he found that the lack of a challenge made it a poor value for experienced gamers, since {{they would be able to}} finish the entire game in a day or two, and recommended it strictly for gamers who were new to the adventure genre. Ric Manning of the Gannett News Service wrote, [...] "The graphics are terrific, but don't play on a full stomach." [...] Steve La Rue of U-T San Diego found the game [...] "visually opulent and interesting" [...] with [...] "dialogue a lot better than I expected, given the trite gothic novel plot", but also <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> adjust to the [...] "gradual, contemplative pace". Jack Warner of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote: [...] "It's hackneyed, but the art is so good, the acting sufficiently convincing and the atmosphere brooding enough to keep you going", although he said [...] "precious little happens" [...] in the first few discs.|$|E
500|$|The show's {{directors}} {{were attached to}} locations instead of episodes and with several countries appearing in every episode, in reality none of them has a singular director. During the first season the Wachowskis were responsible for directorial duties in scenes shot in Chicago and San Francisco along with London and Iceland, two places which were initially announced to be helmed by Straczynski. Straczynski eventually opted to offer them to the siblings because of the extensive action scenes involved in those locations and instead focused his energy on post-production. James McTeigue (V for Vendetta, Ninja Assassin) worked on the Mexico City and Mumbai parts along with some in Reykjavík and German director Tom Tykwer (Cloud Atlas), whose Nairobi Half Life production impressed the Wachowskis, helmed Berlin and Nairobi. Dan Glass, {{who had been the}} visual effects supervisor for every Wachowski film since The Matrix Reloaded, reprised his role in Sense8 while also making his directorial debut in the Seoul part of the story. Even though there were times that units located in different countries were simultaneously shooting, the Wachowskis would travel to the various locations and have collaborations with the attached directors. Reportedly the Wachowskis directed such segments in locations where a different director was otherwise attached as the stunts the character of Silvestre performed for his action movie in Mexico City and in Nairobi car chase scenes with the [...] "Van Damn" [...] bus along with a fight scene involving machetes. In total, the Wachowskis were credited for directing seven episodes, McTeigue and Tykwer two each, and Glass one. During filming of the first season of Sense8 the Wachowskis were shooting ten to fifteen pages a day, which was much faster than the two to three pages a day pace they were used to on the typical large budget film. They commented it put {{a lot of pressure on}} them, but Lilly also called it exciting learning how to adapt to it. Tykwer <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be moving at a pace of completing seven minutes per day, which he similarly found highly unusual coming from the world of film.|$|E

500|$|The {{read-through}} for [...] "The Angels Take Manhattan" [...] {{took place}} in the Upper Boat Studios on 23 March 2012, alongside that for the episode [...] "Asylum of the Daleks". The final episode Gillan and Darvill shot as Amy and Rory was actually the previous episode, [...] "The Power of Three". Nevertheless, Gillan and Smith got very emotional filming the final graveyard scene. Amy and Rory's scene on the rooftop was filmed in a car park in Cardiff, Wales, with a greenscreen standing in for the New York skyline. To create the effect of the two plunging down, Gillan and Darvill were suspended upside-down by wires and raised and lowered. Much of the episode was filmed in Central Park in New York City in April 2012. The filming was attended by thousands of American fans, which surprised the cast and crew. Other scenes were shot at night in the city, {{as well as by the}} East River in front of the Brooklyn Bridge and in the Tudor City apartment complex. Moffat was in New York City when he came up with the story, and thought it was appropriate for the Weeping Angels. He described the city as [...] "a different backdrop" [...] to shoot a Doctor Who story in, and made use of its architecture. Fellow executive producer Caroline Skinner felt that the location [...] "has such scale and romance" [...] which [...] " [...] the episode a real atmosphere and a very different tone for Doctor Who". The week spent filming in the city was done by a [...] "small unit by American standards" [...] according to producer Marcus Wilson. They did not take any props of Angels or the TARDIS, which were instead added in post-production. Filming for the episode also occurred at a cemetery in Llanelli. During post-production, the New York skyline was inserted into the cemetery scenes. Gillan insisted on reading Amy's afterword to Smith when his reaction was filmed. They were not expecting it to be in front of a crowd in Central Park, and Smith <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> [...] "treat this like a play". Because the content was so secret, Gillan had to read very quietly and Smith could not hold the real page because a spectator might take a picture of it. Gillan found that she only had one page of the script, and had to improvise the rest.|$|E
