5|$|Recorded {{over six}} weeks in late 2004, Commit This to Memory was created largely at Seedy Underbelly Studios, a <b>suburban</b> <b>home</b> {{converted}} into a studio in Los Angeles' Valley Village region. The album was written partially in their hometown of Minneapolis and partially in Los Angeles, during {{a period in which}} frontman Justin Pierre was seeking treatment for alcohol abuse. He hoped for his lyricism to better emphasize storytelling, inspired by the lyrics of Tom Waits, Ben Folds and John K. Samson. Hoppus mainly worked with the band on completing song arrangements.|$|E

5|$|The Travel Inn in Tujunga, California, was repainted {{and used}} as the {{interior}} of Leonard's and Dodd's motel rooms and {{the exterior of the}} film's Discount Inn. Scenes in Sammy Jankis' house were shot in a <b>suburban</b> <b>home</b> close to Pasadena, while Natalie's house was located in Burbank. The crew planned to shoot the derelict building set (where Leonard kills Teddy and Jimmy) in a Spanish-styled brick building owned by a train company. However, one week before shooting began, the company placed several dozen train carriages outside the building, making the exterior unfilmable. Since the interior of the building had already been built as a set, a new location had to be found. An oil refinery near Long Beach was used instead, and the scene where Leonard burns his wife's possessions was filmed {{on the other side of}} the refinery.|$|E

When government agents appear on the scene, the aliens flee in their spaceship, leaving {{one of their own}} behind in their haste. At a <b>suburban</b> <b>home,</b> a ten-year-old boy named Elliott is spending time with his brother, Michael, and his friends. As he returns from picking up a pizza, he discovers that something is hiding in their tool shed. The alien promptly flees upon being discovered. Despite his family's disbelief, Elliott leaves Reese's Pieces candy to lure the alien to his house. Before going to sleep, Elliott realizes it is imitating his movements. He feigns illness the next morning to stay home from school and play with it. Later that day, Michael and their five-year-old sister, Gertie, meet it. They decide to keep it hidden from their mother, Mary. When they ask it about its origin, it levitates several balls to represent its solar system and then demonstrates its powers by reviving dead chrysanthemums.|$|E

5|$|The band joined Blink-182 for a European trek {{in early}} 2004, at the {{recommendation}} of Blink-182's bassist Mark Hoppus. Cain invited Hoppus to produce the band's sophomore album, and he accepted. In late 2004, the band continued touring internationally with Blink-182, this time in Japan. The group accumulated significant buzz, and were regarded as a must-see act on the Warped Tour 2004. The band recorded their second album, Commit This to Memory at Seedy Underbelly Studios, a <b>suburban</b> <b>home</b> converted into a studio in Los Angeles' Valley Village region. The album was written partially in their hometown of Minneapolis and partially in Los Angeles, during {{a period in which}} Pierre was seeking treatment for alcohol abuse. Commit This to Memory was the first album by the band to feature material crafted by each musician in the group, as previous releases had featured songs written in the years prior to each member joining. For this album, the band also had more time and funds create the album. During the recording of the album, the band embarked on their first headlining tour, The Sub-Par Punk Who Cares Tour 2004. By the end of 2004, the band played in over 270 shows that year.|$|E

25|$|The company outgrew its <b>suburban</b> <b>home</b> in 1995 {{and moved}} to CBD office {{accommodation}} yet its early growth during the Internet boom was hampered by the ability of Telstra (not releasing Bigpond as an ISP until 1997) {{to cope with the}} demand of needed telephone lines, and by the sheer competitive pressure in the Perth market, which had a comparative oversupply of low-cost providers. In 1996, iiNet successfully expanded into the Adelaide market under the name light.iinet.net.au (named after Colonel Light), in partnership with locals John Lindsay and Leigh Hart. The SA arm moved quickly to become the number three ISP in the state, before being acquired by Auslink in 1998.|$|E
25|$|The {{vaudeville}} {{talents of}} Graham Kennedy, Don Lane and Bert Newton earned popular success {{during the early}} years of Australian television. The variety show Hey Hey It's Saturday screened for three decades. Among the best loved Australian sitcoms was Mother and Son, about a divorcee who had moved back into the <b>suburban</b> <b>home</b> of his mother – but sketch comedy has been the stalwart of Australian television. The Comedy Company, in the 1980s, featured the comic talents of Mary-Anne Fahey, Ian McFadyen, Mark Mitchell, Glenn Robbins, Kym Gyngell and others. Growing out of Melbourne University and The D-Generation came The Late Show (1991–1993), starring the influential talents Santo Cilauro, Tom Gleisner, Jane Kennedy, Tony Martin, Mick Molloy and Rob Sitch (who later formed Working Dog Productions); and during the 1980s and 1990s Fast Forward (Steve Vizard, Magda Szubanski, Marg Downey, Michael Veitch, Peter Moon and others) and its successor Full Frontal, which launched the career of Eric Bana and featured Shaun Micallef.|$|E

In 1954, he met schoolmate George Harrison on the bus from his <b>suburban</b> <b>home</b> in Speke.
