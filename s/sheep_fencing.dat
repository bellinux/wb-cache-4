40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the organisation, {{character}} and change of labour relations in expanding capitalist wool farming in the Cape between 1860 and 1950. It {{is an attempt to}} analyse labour in wool farming within a transnational framework, based on an expansion of capital from core to periphery of the capitalist world-economy. Wool farming in peripheries like the Cape was part of capitalist production through the link to primarily the British textile industry. This relationship enabled wool farmers to invest in their farms in <b>sheep,</b> <b>fences</b> and windmills. They thereby became agents of capital expansion in the world-economy, which was a prerequisite for a capitalist expansion. Although wool production in the Cape was initially an imperial division of labour, that relation changed during the twentieth century as Britain’s leading role as textile producer was challenged by other capitalist core countries. Capitalism as a transnational production system, based on commodity chains from periphery to core, became the most crucial structure for wool farmers in the Cape, who could increase their exports. The thesis also shows that the pre-capitalist generational division of labour among black peasants, through which farmers acquired labour, especially shepherds, was both discarded and intensified. Shepherding was intensified along with fencing during {{the late nineteenth and early}} twentieth century due to threat from jackals and lack of sufficient water supplies. Those farmers who invested in technology in the form of jackal-proof fences and windmills managed to change production from herding to rotational grazing in camps, which meant that shepherds were replaced by camp walkers, who controlled <b>fences</b> instead of <b>sheep.</b> Those farmers who did not invest were forced to exploit the pre-capitalist relations more intensively and hire shepherds in order to be able to produce and sell wool to textile manufacturers in capitalist core areas. As the young adult males disappeared from farms to the mines, the role of children and youths as shepherds became increasingly important. By the 1940 s almost all the shepherds were children or youths, but they were about to be made redundant, as the number of shepherds decreased during the 1930 s and 1940 s...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} consequential costs of livestock depredation by large carnivores. We estimate costs for productivity losses and additional labor using Swedish survey data on sheep farmers. Impacts on productivity and labor are identified through a comparison of sheep farmers in areas with low and high carnivore densities, farmers that have suffered attacks, and summer pasture farmers that have and have not suffered attacks, respectively. Results indicate that sheep herds in areas with high densities of carnivores and in herds that have experienced carnivore attacks have lower reproductive rates than do herds in areas with low densities of carnivores. Farmers who have experienced a carnivore attack on their livestock spend extra labor on fence maintenance, searching for lost animals, and bringing the animals in for the night. The use of enforced so-called carnivore fences has a significant impact on time spent on fence maintenance and on searching for lost animals. Finally, results show that costs for farmers that have experienced an attack differ between farms that keep the <b>sheep</b> within <b>fences,</b> and summer pasture farms that apply free-range grazing. Results from the study can motivate the use of a flat rate compensation per ewe in the herd, which is differentiated between farms in areas with high carnivore densities and conventional and summer pasture farms that have suffered an attack...|$|R
50|$|The {{pronghorn}} is {{the fastest}} land mammal in the Western Hemisphere, being built for maximum predator evasion through running. The top speed {{is very hard to}} measure accurately and varies between individuals; it can run 35 mph for 4 mi (56 km/h for 6 km), 42 mph for 1 mi (67 km/h for 1.6 km), and 55 mph for 0.5 mi (88.5 km/h for 0.8 km). It is often cited as the second-fastest land animal, second only to the cheetah. It can, however, sustain high speeds longer than cheetahs. University of Idaho zoologist John Byers has suggested the pronghorn evolved its running ability to escape from extinct predators such as the American cheetah, since its speed greatly exceeds that of extant North American predators. Compared to its body size, the pronghorn has a large windpipe, heart, and lungs to allow it to take in large amounts of air when running. Additionally, pronghorn hooves have two long, cushioned, pointed toes which help absorb shock when running at high speeds. They also have an extremely light bone structure and hollow hair. Pronghorns are built for speed, not for jumping. Their ranges are sometimes affected by <b>sheep</b> ranchers' <b>fences.</b> However, they can be seen going under fences, sometimes at high speed. For this reason, the Arizona Antelope Foundation and others {{are in the process of}} removing the bottom barbed wire from the fences, and/or installing a barbless bottom wire.|$|R

40|$|Intensification {{of sheep}} farming in the uplands has caused concern {{in terms of}} {{over-production}} and conservation of wildlife and landscape. Changes in UK agricultural policy to combat these problems are {{likely to result in}} reduced pasture improvement and sheep grazing in the uplands. This paper examines the effects, on three adjacent uplands grasslands, of different intensities of sheep management on the soil biota. The effects of short-term removal of <b>sheep</b> grazing by <b>fenced</b> exclosure were also studied. After preliminary investigations the soil Collembola, in particular the fungal-feeding species Onychiurus procampatus, were selected for further study. Field sampling revealed simultaneous trends of decreasing Collembola numbers and increasing total hyphal length and biomass of fungi in the surface soil, together with differences in chemical and physical soil properties, along a gradient of reduced sheep management intensity. Similar changes occurred when sheep grazing was removed by fenced exclosures. The abundance of fluorescein diacetate-active hyphae within the surface soil was shown to vary little along the same gradient of reduced sheep management intensity. The relative abundance of the seven most commonly isolated species of litter fungi varied along the same gradient of sheep management. The findings are discussed in relation to other grassland studies...|$|R

5000|$|Cattle {{ranching}} {{was already}} a well established trade in Texas by 1870, when shepherding was starting to become popular {{in other parts of}} the Old West. Because of this, whether in Texas or elsewhere, many cattlemen had close relationships with local government figures and they were able to use this influence to their advantage. According to one Texas historian, [...] "In court action, the cowboy cattleman usually won." [...] The sheepherders were always considered the weaker, or lesser, of the antagonists. They were often advocates of free grazing on public land, while the cattlemen typically fenced off the territory whether it was public or private land. There were many reasons why a cattle rancher would build fences, mostly it was to mark boundaries, prevent rustling, and to keep other people from grazing their animals there. Furthermore, there was also the threat of <b>sheep</b> scab. Building <b>fences</b> across the range infuriated the sheep herders, as well as open range cattlemen, so conflicts like the Fence Cutting War became almost inevitable. Racism was also a factor, being that many of the shepherds were either Hispanic or Native American. One of the earliest sheep wars was fought in 1875, in the Charles Goodnight range, along the Texas-New Mexico border. Later, sheep wars occurred in the central and West Texas counties of Schleicher, Nolan, Brown, Crane, Tom Green, San Saba and Coleman.|$|R
40|$|Leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula L.), {{a widely}} {{established}} exotic, noxious, perennial weed, {{is a major}} threat to rangeland and wildland in the Upper Great Plains. Chemical, biological, and cultural control methods have limitations in their applicability and effectiveness in treating leafy spurge. However, many of the constraints prohibiting the use of herbicides, tillage, and biological controls do not apply to sheep grazing. Sheep grazing, while known to be effective in controlling leafy spurge since the 1930 s, has lacked widespread adoption as a leafy spurge control. A deterministic, bioeconomic model, incorporating relationships between sheep grazing and leafy spurge control, grass recovery, and forage use by cattle, was developed to evaluate the economic viability of using sheep to control leafy spurge. Discounted annual control costs were compared to discounted annual control benefits over 5 -year, 10 -year, and 15 -year periods. Various scenarios were developed depicting likely situations involving adopting a sheep enterprise or leasing sheep for leafy spurge control. Situational factors considered included fencing expenses, debt considerations, grazing values, infestation size, infestation canopy cover, rangeland productivity, and flock performance. Two levels of flock profitability, one based on a level of proficiency achieved by sheep ranches and one substantially lower than typically achieved in the sheep industry, represented best-case and worst-case situations, respectively. In the best-case situations, using sheep to control leafy spurge was economical in all of the control scenarios examined. However, in the worst-case situations, economics of using sheep to control leafy spurge were mixed across the scenarios examined. Leafy spurge control with poor <b>sheep</b> management, high <b>fence</b> expense, and unproductive rangeland generally was not economical. However, situations with low fencing costs, moderately productive rangeland, and poor sheep management resulted in less economic loss than no treatment. Although many of the key relationships tying leafy spurge control to grazing benefits remain unquantified, the economics of sheep grazing were positive across many of the scenarios evaluated in this study. Actual returns from leafy spurge control for most ranchers will likely fall between the two extremes examined. As a precaution, careful evaluation using site- and rancher-specific inputs would be recommended before implementing sheep grazing as a leafy spurge control method.

50|$|In modern times, {{almost all}} threats to golden eagles are attributable, {{directly}} or indirectly, to human activities. In fact, all Aquila eagles in Eurasia {{face the same}} human-sourced threats as the golden eagle: habitat change, persecution, poisoning (often directed at other species) and collisions with man-made objects. Certainly the most widespread unintentional threat to golden eagles by humans is urbanization and human-population growth which have made areas historically used by eagles unsuitable {{both in terms of}} habitat and prey availability. Habitat destruction in North America had, by the late 19th century, already driven golden eagles from some regions they used to inhabit. In Southern California and the Colorado Front Range, this has been proved via long-term population and habitat surveys. In Western China, the main threats to golden eagles are land development, the use of pesticides and apparent regular captures for falconry. Fires since 1980 have caused large-scale losses of shrubs and jackrabbit habitat in areas used by eagles throughout the Intermountain West of North America. Wildfires that burned more 40,000 hectares of scrublands between 1981 and 1987 in the Morley Nelson Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area affected nesting populations adversely. Nesting success at burned territories in Snake River Canyon declined after major fires. Abandoned burned territories have been subsumed by neighboring pairs, resulting in a decreased number of nesting pairs. In a few cases, mankind has accidentally benefited golden eagles by logging previously heavily wooded areas. This has been recorded in the 1800s and 1900s in the Appalachian Mountains of the Eastern United States, where reforestation has now made the habitat unsuitable for nesting eagles, and in Washington state, which still holds breeding eagles in desolate areas that have been logged. Afforestation, the commercial planting of non-native woodland, is a serious issue in Scotland, with the largest amount of it occurring in southwestern Scotland, especially in Argyll. During afforestation, the land is ploughed and in excess of 2,500 seedlings are planted per hectare, mainly with exotic conifers including Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta). The woodland canopy closes and ground vegetation dies, making these dark and gloomy places until harvesting in 40 to 50 years. More than 50% of land in Scotland at an elevation of 200 - 600 m has been planted as such. Afforestation requires removal of <b>sheep</b> and the <b>fencing</b> out or shooting deer, both important sources of carrion for golden eagles. Foraging areas of golden eagles have been confirmed to not include afforested areas.|$|R
40|$|Virtual fences (VF) {{are based}} on sensory cues {{delivered}} to domestic animals {{with the aim of}} controlling their spatial behaviour without any physical barrier. VF represent an approach for controlling the distribution of free-ranging large herbivores in large rangeland areas where the implementation of human control or the use of physical fencing is made impossible by their cost, environmental concerns or specific regulations. The potential of using VF for sheep was investigated by studying the spatial behaviour of groups of 5 or 32 ewes submitted to a commercial animal-borne VF device aimed at containing them in a defined area in a series of experiments. All tests were performed in pasture alleys virtually divided in their centre by a 4 -m-wide warning/punishment zone). The ewes were introduced {{on one side of the}} zone, the other side being made attractive by the presence of tall grass (feed attractant), the presence of peers (social attractant) or being made unattractive by the presence of short grass (same feed as in the alley). In a first experiment, ewes were trained in groups of 5 with a feed attractant, following a 3 -stage procedure: 30 -min adaptation, 90 -min training with a visual cue (three white strings above the wire of the VF) and 30 -min test without a visual cue. In a second experiment, the test stage was repeated for each group with feed, social and zero attractants. In a third experiment, the test with feed attractant was performed with groups of 32 ewes comprising previously trained and equipped ewes mixed in different percentages of trained: naïve (untrained and unequipped) ewes (100 : 0, 75 : 25, 50 : 50 and 0 : 100 %). One year later, this test was repeated with a feed attractant either close (30 m) or far (60 m) from the punishment zone. By increasing the distance to the feed attractant, it was anticipated that this would stimulate the conflict of motivation between feed and peers. Ewes learned readily the concept of VF after a couple of contacts with the punishment zone. In the second experiment in the test with a social attractant, a few trained ewes penetrated the VF to re-associate with peers located in the pen opposite the VF. Expression of the behaviour to challenge or cross the punishment zone differed widely among individuals. In mixed groups, naïve ewes crossed the punishment zone and lead part of their trained peers across the punishment zone, regardless of the distance of the feed attractant from the punishment zone. The results suggest that VF can be used to alter the distribution of grazing <b>sheep</b> within large <b>fenced</b> areas although they cannot replace conventional fences for absolute control.
