5|$|Electrolysis of {{a mixture}} of {{beryllium}} fluoride and <b>sodium</b> <b>fluoride</b> was used to isolate beryllium during the 19th century. The metal's high melting point makes this process more energy-consuming than corresponding processes used for the alkali metals.

5|$|Soluble {{fluorides}} are moderately toxic: 5–10g <b>sodium</b> <b>fluoride,</b> or 32–64mg fluoride ions per kilogram of body mass, {{represents a}} lethal dose for adults. One-fifth of the lethal dose can cause adverse health effects, and chronic excess consumption {{may lead to}} skeletal fluorosis, which affects millions in Asia and Africa. Ingested fluoride forms hydrofluoric acid in the stomach which is easily absorbed by the intestines, where it crosses cell membranes, binds with calcium and interferes with various enzymes, before urinary excretion. Exposure limits are determined by urine testing of the body's ability to clear fluoride ions.|$|E
40|$|Solar {{power has}} been focused on as an {{alternative}} for exhaustible and environment-unfriendly energy resources. Crystalline silicon solar cells are market-dominating solar energy devices based on a mature silicon technology. However, the limiting efficiency of crystalline silicon solar cells is 29. 8 % due to intrinsic loss mechanisms. One of the major loss mechanisms is transmission of sub-band-gap photons. In the case of crystalline silicon solar cells, approximately 20 % of the solar energy is wasted by the transmission losses. These transmitted photons could contribute to the power conversion of solar cells through optical conversion of two or more sub-band-gap photons to generate one above-band-gap photon. Trivalent erbium doped hexagonal <b>sodium</b> yttrium <b>fluoride</b> has been selected as an upconverter due to the ideal energy states of erbium and low phonon energies of hexagonal <b>sodium</b> yttrium <b>fluoride</b> that reduce non-radiative quenching mechanisms during upconversion processes. However, this upconverter has also suffered from low absorption, non-linear power dependence and the narrow ground state absorption bandwidth of erbium. This thesis aims to fabricate efficient upconversion silicon solar cells using efficient upconverting nanocrystal, direct deposition techniques of upconverting nanocrystals on solid state solar cells and broad-band sensitisation of lead sulphide (PbS) quantum dot that extends the available solar spectrum for the narrow bandwidth. The meso-structured erbium doped hexagonal <b>sodium</b> yttrium <b>fluoride</b> nanocrystals were deposited on a bifacial crystalline silicon solar cell by spin-casting, resulting in higher absorption, brighter upconversion luminescence and high photoconversion efficiency. The highest external quantum efficiency measured was 0. 125 % under a laser excitation at 1525 nm and 0. 071 W/cm 2. With the upconverting nanocrystals, the addition of PbS quantum dot layers to the upconverting layers exhibited an extended spectral response to shorter wavelengths. The results of the optical converter made using erbium doped hexagonal <b>sodium</b> yttrium <b>fluoride</b> nanocrystals and PbS quantum dots demonstrate the potential of reduced transmission losses and enhanced photocurrent generation of sub-band-gap photons...|$|R

25|$|Tin(II) fluoride, {{commonly}} referred to commercially as stannous fluoride (from Latin , 'tin') is a chemical compound with the formula SnF2. It is a colorless solid used as an ingredient in toothpastes that are typically more expensive than those that use <b>sodium</b> <b>fluoride.</b> Stannous fluoride converts the calcium mineral apatite into fluorapatite, which makes tooth enamel more resistant to bacteria-generated acid attacks. In toothpastes containing calcium minerals, <b>sodium</b> <b>fluoride</b> becomes ineffective over time, while stannous fluoride remains effective in strengthening tooth enamel.

X-ray diftraction studies show that Mrr apatite, chlorapatite, and pyromorphite group are similar {{in that they are}} monoclinic and the ion in the "X " site, which is oxygen or chloride, is coordinated with six cations.

To monitor these ions, inexpensive, label-free chemical sensing devices are needed. Field-effect transistors (FETs) based on silicon (Si) nanowires or nanoribbons (NRs) have a great potential as future biochemical sensors as they allow for the integration in microscopic devices at low production costs.
