30|$|Most of the {{enterprises}} of the World {{belong to}} the class of microenterprises and thus, the contributions of microenterprises to the national economic growth {{and development of the}} countries are not ignorable. Establishing a microenterprise does not involve the huge formalities and substantial funds that small, medium and large enterprises require. However, for a healthy growth of microenterprises, the determining factors must be identified and policies should be undertaken and implemented in an appropriate manner. The objective of the current study is to identify different potential factors that contribute to the overall growth of the Malaysian microenterprises. Computing descriptive statistics and applying multiple regression analysis to data for 253 microenterprises of Malaysia, the study finds that a certain number of entrepreneurial and enterprise characteristics along with several economic factors affect the overall performance of microenterprises. Specifically, it is found that competition and the age of the enterprises negatively affect overall performance of the microenterprises whereas age of the entrepreneurs, education, business training, demand for the product/service, availability of physical space for business expansion in the city area, availability of financing and sufficiency of <b>secured</b> <b>amount</b> of finance pose positive impacts on the growth. The results of this study provide some insights to policymakers and business practitioners to address the determinants pertaining to microenterprise growth.|$|E
30|$|To sum up, {{the above}} {{theoretical}} and empirical discussions reveal {{that the success of}} microenterprises depends on three dimensions- owner characteristics, firm characteristics, and external conditions of the overall economic environment. It may be noted that most of the studies discussed above are within the context of developed countries or developing countries outside East Asian countries in general and, in particular, outside of Malaysia whereas Malaysia being one of the emerging economies warrants attention as, like many other countries, majority of the Malaysian enterprises are micro in nature and government of Malaysia has undertaken over 650 microenterprise development programs (Munoz et al. 2014). Hence, the objective of the current study is to examine the success factors of Malaysian microenterprises based on entrepreneur characteristics along with firm characteristics and external factors. This study will be distinct from existing studies at least in three aspects: First, this study includes external factors such as demand for the products/service of microenterprises, competition, limited space of expansion, facilities for training, and ease and <b>secured</b> <b>amount</b> of financial resources that are rarely examined in the previous studies and not examined in the case of Malaysia; Second, the current study is based on the recent survey that is just conducted in 2015 will reflect the current patter of perceptions of entrepreneurs; and Third, this study will be a comprehensive one on the factors determining the success of Malaysian microenterprises as the previous studies focused on small and medium enterprises (SMEs) not exclusively microenterprises (Aziz and Mahmood 2011; Mahmood and Hanafi 2013; Man 2011). A few studies are found in the Malaysian case that examined the relationship between firm performance and entrepreneurial orientation but not including all the variables as this study focuses on (Awang et al. 2011; Munoz et al. 2014).|$|E
30|$|National {{development}} {{ignoring the}} contribution of microenterprises {{may not be possible}} as the majority of the enterprises of any country belong to this group. Therefore, identifying the factors that contribute to the performance of the microenterprises is an essential call in the academic arena of micro, small and medium enterprises. This study, thus, seeks the answer for the potential factors that contribute to the successes of the microenterprises in Malaysia. It is exposed that the age of the entrepreneurs, education, business training, demand for the product/service, availability of physical space for business expansion in the city area, availability of financing and sufficiency of <b>secured</b> <b>amount</b> of finance pose positive impacts on the growth whereas competition and the age of the enterprises negatively affect overall performance of the microenterprises. As the enterprises grow older their performance or the growth decreases; meaning that young firms perform better than older firms. Usually, competition is assumed to have positive impacts on the growth of the firms; however, in this study the sign for the coefficient of the competition is negative implying that the competition reduces the growth of microenterprises in Malaysia. This might be because of the reason that the most of the microenterprises are in their young stage to bear the competition. Education and training are found to be very important factors for the success of microenterprises in Malaysia. If the entrepreneurs are properly educated and are well trained off the performance of their enterprises must be higher. Market demands for the products/services are crucially important for the enterprises to grow. If the demand increases the growth of the enterprises will be higher. Access to sources of funds and sufficiency of the secured funds has positive impacts on the performances of the microenterprises. The results of this study provide insights to the policymakers and practitioners to create a congenial atmosphere for the microenterprises to grow. Factors such as education, training, fair competition, easy financing and sufficient supply of funds will boost the progress of microenterprises. More focuses should be placed for the young firms as they have the higher potential to grow and contribute to the national economic development.|$|E

40|$|En: Hermeneutics and the Tradition compilado por Daniel O. Dahlstrom. Washington: American Catholic Philosophical Association, 1988, pp. 212 - 24. Quine's Indeterminacy of Translation {{thesis is}} {{grounded}} in language-verificationism [...] the claim that language contains no unverifiable relation. Quine's thesis issues in a hermeneutic doctrine {{to the effect that}} exegetical disputes are empty, any construal's correctness depending on the choice of a translation manual alone. Gadamer, on the other hand, maintains that a sense is bestowed upon a text by the interpreter's understanding horizon, the comprehension thus <b>secured</b> <b>amounting</b> to a merging of horizons. Translation, according to Gadamer, is to be conceived as a recreation (Nachbildung). While there are differences between Quine's and Gadamer' s views, I emphasize their deep agreements.

That relativism is found fault with; for it entails that philosophical deliberation is futile, insomuch as a philosophical system can be construed {{in such a way as}} to be equivalent to another, when what was going on was pondering on which of them, if any, was true.
