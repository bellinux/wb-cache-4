Since family firms {{are known to}} be more risk averse {{concerning}} international transactions, an interesting question emerges: Do family firms adopt a different international <b>sourcing</b> <b>pattern.</b> Altering the Gloubal Sourcing model of Antr 0 s and Helpman, this theoretical contribution adopts a family firm's perspective. The model shows that family firms tend to decrease international procurement. In the headquarter intensive sector, where FDI coexists with international outsourcing, family firms unambiguously decrease FDI, whereas the effect on international outsourcing is ambiguous: A substitution process may work towards an increase in international outsourcing activities...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} reduce both {{acquisition}} and reconstruction times, illumination and detection in fluorescence diffuse optical tomography (FDOT) have recently evolved from a point-based to a pattern-based approach. The use of structured illumination, offering the ability to project any pattern of light onto the object, associated with the compression of the acquired fluorescence images has {{paved the way for}} a new generation of fast reconstruction algorithms for FDOT. However, the choice of the most appropriate set of <b>source</b> <b>patterns</b> is still an open problem. Here, the use of typical <b>source</b> <b>patterns</b> is investigated on experimental data. Reconstructions of similar qualities are obtained for the different types of <b>source</b> <b>patterns.</b> We found that the performances of structured illumination are limited by the required positivity of the <b>source</b> <b>patterns.</b> To alleviate this problem, we introduce a novel method, namely the virtual <b>source</b> <b>pattern</b> method, which allows for considering any kind of patterns, e. g., with negative and complex intensities. This new method provides a significant increase of the contrast of the reconstruction and also a reduction of the reconstruction error, especially when virtual wavelet <b>source</b> <b>patterns</b> are considered...|$|R
40|$|In model transformations, rules handle mapping between source {{metamodel}} {{elements and}} target metamodel elements. There are {{cases in which}} more complex structures in the source have to be selected. In some transformation languages, these complex <b>source</b> <b>patterns</b> require decomposition of trans-formation specifications into multiple rules. This decomposition negatively affects qualities of transformation specifications such as modifiability and consistency. The handling of a complex <b>source</b> <b>pattern</b> by a single transformation rule requires composition at finer granularity, i. e., operation composition. In this paper, we show how operation composition improves the quality of transformation specifications for complex <b>source</b> <b>patterns.</b> As an illustration, we implemented a complex <b>source</b> <b>pattern</b> transformation for agent systems in two well-known model transformation languages, ATL and Tefkat. ATL supports com-position at rule level, and Tefkat supports composition at operation level. We describe the requirements for transformation languages {{in order to support}} the handling of complex <b>source</b> <b>patterns</b> in single transformation rules.

40|$|Portable X-ray Fluorescence (PXRF) {{analysis}} {{was applied to}} silcrete artefacts from surface concentrations in the southern Arcadia Valley, eastern Australia. These artefacts were manufactured from river cobbles, {{as shown by the}} waterworn cortex, and could have been obtained from three sources: Dawson River, Carnarvon Creek and/or Clematis Creek. PXRF analyses of cobbles from these sites, evaluated using nonparametric statistics (because the data are skewed) and confidence ellipses, showed that the three sources can be distinguished by their Fe and Zr concentrations. Comparison with artefact analyses showed that many artefacts were probably sourced from Clematis Creek, with a substantial number from Dawson River but few, if any, from Carnarvon Creek. The <b>sourcing</b> <b>pattern</b> indicates that Aboriginal people in the Arcadia Valley were influenced not only by proximity when procuring silcrete, but also quality, cobble size and traditional mobility strategies. Carnarvon Creek was ignored because of its distance from the artefact sites and lower quality silcrete. Clematis Creek was the most favoured source because although distant from the artefact sites, it contained large silcrete cobbles (sufficient for the manufacture of large scrapers and knives), and was probably visited frequently due to its central location in the traditional country of the Karingbal People.

40|$|Energy, exergy, and {{economic}} analyses of energy <b>sourcing</b> <b>pattern</b> in a Nigerian brewery {{have been carried}} out. The mean annual energy efficiencies have varied from 75. 62 % in 2004 to 81. 71 % in 2006, while the mean annual exergy efficiencies have varied from 42. 66 % in 2004 to 57. 10 % in 2005. Diesel fuel combustion, whether for local electricity generation via internal combustion engines or for process steam raising in boilers, has adversely affected the efficiencies of energy utilisation in the company. The negative effect of steam raising on efficient energy utilisation is more, although steam raising is unavoidable, {{due to the nature}} of the company under investigation. The annual mean energy unit costs have also varied from 27. 86 USD per Giga-Joule in 2006 to 32. 80 USD per Giga-Joule in 2004, confirming the inverse proportion of energy efficiency and costs. On the other hand, the annual mean exergy unit costs have varied from 40. 19 USD per Giga-Joule in 2005 to 58. 46 USD per Giga-Joule in 2004. The most efficient year has been 2006 energetically and 2005 exergetically. The difference in the two years lies in the proportions of generator diesel and boiler diesel utilised as the system exergy is most sensitive to boiler diesel use while the system energy is more sensitive to generator diesel utilisation due to their different device efficiencies...|$|E
40|$|This study uses firm-level panel {{data from}} Romania {{to examine whether}} the origin of foreign investors affects the degree of {{vertical}} spillovers from FDI. Investors' origin may matter for spillovers to domestic producers supplying intermediate inputs in two ways. First, the share of intermediates sourced locally by multinationals {{is likely to increase}} with the distance between the host and the source economy. Second, the <b>sourcing</b> <b>pattern</b> is likely to be affected by preferential trade agreements. In this case, the Association Agreement between Romania and the European Union (EU) implies that inputs sourced from the EU are subject to a lower tariff than inputs sourced from the United States or Canada. This means that on average American investors may have a greater incentive than EU investors to source from Romania and hence present a greater potential for vertical spillovers. The empirical analysis produces evidence consistent with this hypothesis. The results show a positive association between the presence of American companies in downstream sectors and the productivity of Romanian firms in the supplying industries and no significant relationship in the case of European affiliates. The results also indicate that Romanian firms in sectors whose products are expensive to transport benefit more from downstream presence of American affiliates than Romanian firms in sectors with low shipping costs. No such pattern is found for European affiliates. Spillovers Foreign direct investment Technology transfer Backward linkages...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{existing}} Multi-View Learning (MVL) is {{to discuss}} how to learn from patterns with multiple information sources and has been proven its superior generalization to the usual Single-View Learning (SVL). However, in most real-world cases there are just single <b>source</b> <b>patterns</b> available such that the existing MVL cannot work. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to develop a new multi-view regularization learning for single <b>source</b> <b>patterns.</b> Concretely, for the given single <b>source</b> <b>patterns,</b> we first map them into M feature spaces by M different empirical kernels, then associate each generated feature space with our previous proposed Discriminative Regularization (DR), and finally synthesize M DRs into one sin-gle learning process so as to get a new Multi-view Discriminative Regularization (MVDR), where each DR can be taken as one view of the proposed MVDR. The proposed method achieves: (1) the complementarity for multiple views generated from single source patterns; (2) an analytic solution for classification; (3) a direct optimization formulation for multi-class problems without one-against-all or one-against-one strategies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This study uses a firm-level panel {{data set}} from Romania {{to examine whether}} the {{nationality}} of foreign investors affects the degree of vertical spillovers from FDI. Investors ’ country of origin may matter for spillovers to domestic producers in upstream sectors (supplying intermediate inputs) in two ways. First, the share of intermediate inputs sourced by multinationals from a host country {{is likely to increase}} with the distance between the host and the source economy. Second, the <b>sourcing</b> <b>pattern</b> is likely to be affected by preferential trade agreements that cover some but not other source economies. In our case, the Association Agreements signed between Romania and the EU implies that inputs sourced from the EU are subject to a lower tariff than inputs sourced from the US or Asia. Moreover, while for European investors intermediate inputs sourced from home country suppliers comply with the rules of origin and thus can be exported to the EU on preferential terms, this would not be the case for home country suppliers of American or Asian multinationals. Therefore, we would expect that American and Asian investors source more from Romania than EU investors and thus present greater potential for vertical spillovers. The empirical analysis produces evidence in support of our hypothesis. We find a positive association between presence of American and Asian companies in downstream sectors and the productivity of Romanian firms in the supplying industries. Further, the productivity of Romanian firms in the supplying sectors is negatively correlated with operations of European investors in downstream sectors. The differences between the effects associated with investors of different origin are statistically significant...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{involves}} the secondary data of 1806 innovative manufacturing firms {{derived from the}} database of 2 nd Taiwanese Innovation Survey. Three topics are researched. The first topic investigates the innovation value chain (IVC) in Taiwanese manufacturing firms. Previous IVC studies are all done in developed countries such as UK, Ireland, Northern Ireland and Switzerland, and it leaves the gap of those non-developed countries. The result shows the overall knowledge <b>sourcing</b> <b>pattern</b> of Taiwanese manufacturing firms presenting a complementary relationship which is consistent to the previous IVC studies. The main innovation input is still derived from internal R&D which suggests more utilisation of external knowledge may boost innovation outcome. Product innovation does enhance firm growth while process innovation reduces a firm’s productivity. The second topic uses the lens of IVC to investigate the difference of the innovation process from knowledge linkages to value added between high-tech and low- tech sectors. The findings indicate (1) there are {{significant differences in the}} IVC between high- and low-tech sectors, however these are defined; (2) how you define ‘sector’ matters i. e. the nature of the high-tech and low-tech differences varies depending on whether the technology definition is carried out at the industry or firm level; and (3) the high uncertainty of innovation cause the difficulty to predict firm performance especially for those firms with high intensity of innovation. The third topic investigates the innovation-exporting relationship and explores the determinants of export performance. Product innovation enhances export performance once a firm enters international markets while process innovation affects negatively on a firm’s likelihood of being an exporter. Furthermore, IP protection is found to affect directly export performance positively. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

30|$|An {{important}} aspect {{in the identification}} of PCDD/F and PCB sources is the assignment of source profiles (“fingerprint”, congener pattern) [270, 271]. The PCDD/F or PCB fingerprint in environmental media or feed and food can help identify contamination sources and pathways [21, 25]. Congener profiles differ in emissions from certain industries, in specific chemicals or other sources that cause, for example, the contamination of feed. The fingerprint also allows environmental contaminants in soils, sediments, or feed and food to be assigned to specific processes or chemicals. This requires a comprehensive database of source profiles.
